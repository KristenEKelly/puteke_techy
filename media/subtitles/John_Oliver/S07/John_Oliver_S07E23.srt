WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL

5
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:28,934
TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK VOID.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,040
THINK OF IT LIKE THE MOON,

7
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:32,133
IN THAT IT'S FRIGID, COLORLESS,

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,767
AND OCCASIONALLY OCCUPIED BY ONE

9
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:33,994
VERY LONELY, MALNOURISHED MAN

10
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:34,967
WHO HAS DEFINITELY URINATED

11
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:36,500
IN HIS SUIT.

12
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:37,843
AND WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO DIVE

13
00:00:37,867 --> 00:00:39,266
STRAIGHT IN WITH OUR MAIN STORY

14
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,934
THIS WEEK, WHICH... UNUSUALLY

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,500
FOR US... CONCERNS THE WEEK

16
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:42,567
THAT WE'VE JUST HAD.

17
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:43,843
IT'S ONE OF THE RARE TIMES WE'RE

18
00:00:43,867 --> 00:00:45,367
ACTUALLY LIVING UP TO OUR SHOW'S

19
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:47,000
TITLE, UNLIKE WHAT IT PROBABLY

20
00:00:47,066 --> 00:00:47,934
SHOULD BE CALLED, "28 MINUTES

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,266
ON THE CORN TAX OR WHATEVER

22
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:52,066
THE FUCK WITH JOHN OLIVER."

23
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:55,433
AND THE REASON WE ARE DOING THAT

24
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,300
IS THAT THIS HAS BEEN ONE

25
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:57,033
HELL OF A WEEK.

26
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,242
SO TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO TALK

27
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,309
ABOUT TWO THINGS: THE REPUBLICAN

28
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,200
NATIONAL CONVENTION, AND THE

29
00:01:01,266 --> 00:01:02,133
HORRIFIC EVENTS IN KENOSHA,

30
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,834
WISCONSIN, WHERE JACOB BLAKE WAS

31
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,009
SHOT IN THE BACK BY POLICE, AND

32
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:06,367
A VIGILANTE KILLED TWO PEOPLE.

33
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,033
AND WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT

34
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,900
KENOSHA IN A BIT, BUT LET'S

35
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:12,000
START WITH THE RNC, AN EVENT TO

36
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:13,400
CELEBRATE THE STEWARDSHIP OF

37
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,934
DONALD TRUMP... A TOUGH SELL AT

38
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,834
THE BEST OF TIMES, BUT SOMETHING

39
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,300
THAT FELT PARTICULARLY OUT OF

40
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:19,900
STEP CONSIDERING WE HAVE A

41
00:01:19,967 --> 00:01:21,633
PANDEMIC ON THE RAMPAGE, AN

42
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,910
ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE UNFOLDING,

43
00:01:22,934 --> 00:01:24,042
AND WILDFIRES AND HURRICANES

44
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:25,467
BATTERING THE COUNTRY.

45
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:26,834
ALL OF WHICH MADE IT A LITTLE

46
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,200
JARRING THAT THE REPUBLICANS'

47
00:01:29,266 --> 00:01:30,200
OPENING ARGUMENT SEEMED TO BE

48
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:31,100
ESSENTIALLY THIS:

49
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,033
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

50
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,033
LEADERS AND FIGHTERS FOR FREEDOM

51
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,633
AND LIBERTY AND THE AMERICAN

52
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,066
DREAM!

53
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:37,834
THE BEST!

54
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,200
IS YET!

55
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,600
TO COME!

56
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:43,433
John: OKAY, THEN!

57
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,900
THAT'S KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE,

58
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:46,127
BRINGING AN ENERGY TO THE RNC

59
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,700
THAT CAN REALLY ONLY BE

60
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:48,910
DESCRIBED AS "SORRY, I THOUGHT

61
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:49,667
DOVES WERE GOING TO SHOOT OUT

62
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,066
OF MY HANDS."

63
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:53,533
AND THAT VERY MUCH SET THE TONE.

64
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,266
THE MAIN THEME OF THE CONVENTION

65
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,667
SEEMED TO BE "TELLING LIES

66
00:01:56,734 --> 00:01:57,967
IN FRONT OF FLAGS."

67
00:01:58,033 --> 00:01:59,500
BECAUSE IT WAS FOUR DAYS OF

68
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:00,233
A FULL-THROATED DENIAL OF

69
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,433
OBJECTIVE REALITY.

70
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,367
FOR ONE THING, THERE WAS THE

71
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:04,100
MISLEADING PORTRAIT THEY PAINTED

72
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,567
OF TRUMP'S OPPONENT.

73
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:07,300
IF BIDEN WINS, HE'LL BE

74
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:08,200
CONTROLLED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL

75
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:09,767
EXTREMISTS.

76
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:10,994
WE'D BE ONE STEP CLOSER TO

77
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:12,200
GOVERNMENT-RUN HEALTHCARE.

78
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:13,309
BIDEN HAS PLEDGED TO DEFUND

79
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,600
THE POLICE.

80
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,533
AND HE'S EVEN TALKING ABOUT

81
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,166
TAKING THE WALL DOWN, HOW ABOUT

82
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:18,533
THAT?

83
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,266
John: HONESTLY, THAT SOUNDS

84
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,133
GREAT!

85
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,480
UNFORTUNATELY BIDEN HAS PROMISED

86
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:23,467
TO DO EXACTLY NONE OF THOSE

87
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:24,633
THINGS.

88
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,834
BIDEN IS A RADICAL

89
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,767
ENVIRONMENTALIST

90
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:29,000
POLICE-DEFUNDING SOCIALIST

91
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,226
IN THE SAME WAY I'M HISTORY'S

92
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:32,033
GREATEST ZAZU.

93
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,767
YOU CAN SAY I AM ALL YOU WANT

94
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:35,300
TO, AND I WISH I WERE, BUT THE

95
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:37,033
FACT IS, IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO

96
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,367
BEING TRUE.

97
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:39,476
AND THE LIES TOLD ABOUT BIDEN

98
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,767
WERE JUST THE BEGINNING.

99
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:43,843
CONVENTION SPEAKERS ALSO CLAIMED

100
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:44,600
THAT TRUMP NEVER CALLED WHITE

101
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:45,710
SUPREMACISTS "VERY FINE PEOPLE,"

102
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:46,500
WHICH HE DID; THAT HE PASSED THE

103
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,576
VETERAN'S CHOICE ACT, WHICH HE

104
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,467
DIDN'T; AND THAT HE'S TRYING TO

105
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:49,266
PROTECT PATIENTS WITH

106
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,367
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS,

107
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:53,033
WHICH HE VERY MUCH ISN'T.

108
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,967
I'M HONESTLY SURPRISED A SPEAKER

109
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:55,233
DIDN'T AT ONE POINT CLAIM THAT

110
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:56,266
TRUMP INVENTED PARAKEETS,

111
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,166
OR THAT HE STOPPED

112
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:58,834
THE MURDER HORNETS BY SUCKING

113
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,734
THEM STRAIGHT OUT OF THE AIR.

114
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,867
AND YET, EVEN IN THE MIDST OF

115
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:04,967
A BLIZZARD OF LIES, SOME STILL

116
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:05,967
MANAGED TO STAND OUT... LIKE

117
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:07,200
WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISER

118
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:08,343
LARRY KUDLOW REFERRING TO THE

119
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:09,300
CORONAVIRUS WITH AN ODD CHOICE

120
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:11,433
OF VERB TENSE.

121
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,967
THEN, CAME A ONCE-IN-100-YEAR

122
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:13,800
PANDEMIC.

123
00:03:13,867 --> 00:03:15,500
IT WAS AWFUL.

124
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:17,000
HEALTH AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS WERE

125
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:18,900
TRAGIC.

126
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:19,667
HARDSHIP AND HEARTBREAK WERE

127
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:21,667
EVERYWHERE.

128
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,533
BUT PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP CAME

129
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,900
SWIFTLY AND EFFECTIVELY, WITH AN

130
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:27,176
EXTRAORDINARY RESCUE FOR HEALTH

131
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,834
AND SAFETY TO SUCCESSFULLY FIGHT

132
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,200
THE COVID VIRUS.

133
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:32,533
John: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

134
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,200
YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE

135
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:35,200
CORONAVIRUS IN THE PAST TENSE,

136
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:36,306
WHEN IT IS, IN A VERY REAL

137
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,000
SENSE, STILL RAGING.

138
00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:40,266
IF YOU'RE A CHARACTER IN A "SAW"

139
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,000
MOVIE, YOU DON'T SAY, "PHEW,

140
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:43,306
THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE" WHILE THE

141
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,400
BEAR TRAP IS STILL ON YOUR HEAD.

142
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,767
BUT MAYBE THE BIGGEST GULF

143
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:47,600
BETWEEN THE RNC AND OBJECTIVE

144
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:49,066
REALITY CONCERNED RACE.

145
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:51,266
AGAIN AND AGAIN, RNC SPEAKERS

146
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,166
WERE AT PAINS TO REASSURE

147
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,934
VIEWERS THAT RACISM IN AMERICA

148
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,266
IS MOSTLY A RELIC OF THE PAST,

149
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,533
AND WHATEVER REMAINS CAN BE

150
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,033
EASILY OVERCOME.

151
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,533
TAKE NIKKI HALEY'S SPEECH,

152
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,200
IN WHICH SHE FLATLY INSISTED

153
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:04,100
AMERICA IS NOT A RACIST COUNTRY,

154
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,834
AND THEN TOLD THE INSPIRATIONAL

155
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,266
STORY OF HOW THE CONFEDERATE

156
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,413
FLAG AT HER STATE'S CAPITOL

157
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:09,800
WAS TAKEN DOWN IN 2015

158
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:10,900
AFTER THE MASSACRE AT

159
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:13,300
MOTHER EMMANUEL CHURCH.

160
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:14,633
AFTER THAT HORRIFIC TRAGEDY,

161
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,633
WE DIDN'T TURN AGAINST

162
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,633
EACH OTHER.

163
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,776
WE CAME TOGETHER, BLACK AND

164
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,000
WHITE, DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN.

165
00:04:21,066 --> 00:04:24,834
TOGETHER, WE MADE THE HARD

166
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,000
CHOICES NEEDED TO HEAL, AND

167
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,300
REMOVED A DIVISIVE SYMBOL

168
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,567
PEACEFULLY AND RESPECTFULLY.

169
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:30,633
John: OH, THAT'S WHAT

170
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,567
HAPPENED, IS IT?

171
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:34,033
THAT SOUNDS NICE.

172
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,100
JUST A FEW THINGS THERE... IT'S

173
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,033
A PEACEFUL STORY OF UNITY AND

174
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,467
HOPE AS LONG AS YOU START THE

175
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:40,567
STORY IMMEDIATELY AFTER

176
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:41,133
A WHITE SUPREMACIST KILLED

177
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,667
NINE PEOPLE AT A HISTORIC

178
00:04:41,734 --> 00:04:43,467
BLACK CHURCH.

179
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,100
ALSO, HALEY'S VERSION OF THAT

180
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,767
STORY IGNORES THE FACT THAT

181
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:47,667
THE EVENTUAL REMOVAL OF THE

182
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:51,734
CONFEDERATE FLAG WAS

183
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,066
JUMP-STARTED BY ARTIST AND

184
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:54,033
ACTIVIST BREE NEWSOME BASS,

185
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,667
CLIMBING THE FLAGPOLE IN FRONT

186
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:56,433
OF THE STATE HOUSE LIKE SHE WAS

187
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,433
ON AN ANTI-RACIST VERSION OF

188
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,776
AMERICAN NINJA WARRIOR, AND THAT

189
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,133
SHE WAS THEN ARRESTED, AND THAT

190
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,934
THE FLAG WAS THEN RERAISED

191
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,200
45 MINUTES LATER.

192
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:05,266
HALEY ALSO CONVENIENTLY LEAVES

193
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,000
OUT THE PART WHERE THE CANDIDATE

194
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:08,142
SHE'S ENDORSING HAS DEFENDED

195
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:13,567
THOSE WHO PROUDLY FLY THE FLAG

196
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:14,367
IT REPRESENTS THE SOUTH.

197
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:15,567
SO HALEY TURNING WHAT

198
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:16,873
HAPPENED IN SOUTH CAROLINA INTO

199
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:17,567
A SMOOTH, HOPEFUL STORY OF

200
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:18,900
RACIAL RECONCILIATION IS A BIT

201
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:19,600
LIKE IF SOMEONE ASKED HER WHAT

202
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:22,700
THE FILM "DO THE RIGHT THING" IS

203
00:05:22,767 --> 00:05:23,500
ABOUT AND SHE SAID, "A BROOKLYN

204
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:24,367
NEIGHBORHOOD COMES TOGETHER TO

205
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:26,867
HELP REDECORATE A PIZZA PLACE."

206
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:31,934
I MEAN, SURE, NIKKI, I GUESS

207
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,367
THAT'S TECHNICALLY TRUE, BUT

208
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:34,967
SOME PRETTY IMPORTANT PARTS

209
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:35,633
THERE.

210
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,976
AND A LOT OF THE RNC'S MESSAGING

211
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,142
ON RACE SEEMED INTENDED NOT SO

212
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,242
MUCH TO WIN OVER BLACK VOTERS

213
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:40,900
AS TO REASSURE WHITE PEOPLE

214
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:41,600
THAT THEY COULD VOTE REPUBLICAN

215
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:42,900
WITHOUT BEING RACIST.

216
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:43,767
THE AUDIENCE THEY WERE TALKING

217
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:45,233
TO WAS PRETTY CLEAR, EVEN IN

218
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,700
SMALL MOMENTS LIKE THIS:

219
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:49,200
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW

220
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,934
WE DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN

221
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,834
SUPPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

222
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,333
STANDING WITH OUR

223
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,700
AFRICAN-AMERICAN NEIGHBORS.

224
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:59,633
John: WELL, HOLD ON, MIKE.

225
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,533
WHO IS THE "WE" IN THAT

226
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,467
SENTENCE?

227
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:02,767
BECAUSE IT SEEMS YOU'RE MAKING

228
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:04,100
A DISTINCTION BETWEEN

229
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:04,734
"WE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE" AND

230
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,266
"OUR AFRICAN-AMERICAN

231
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:05,767
NEIGHBORS," WHO I GUESS,

232
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:07,033
BY EXTENSION, ARE SOMEHOW

233
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,633
A DIFFERENT GROUP ENTIRELY.

234
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,166
BUT I GUESS THAT SENTIMENT

235
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:12,242
SHOULDN'T BE REALLY SURPRISING,

236
00:06:12,266 --> 00:06:13,266
COMING FROM MIKE PENCE,

237
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,000
A MAN WHO PERMANENTLY LOOKS LIKE

238
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:14,567
HE SHOULD BE LIVING IN

239
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:15,633
"KEN'S WHITE FLIGHT

240
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:16,900
DREAM HOUSE."

241
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:18,734
AND ALL OF THIS OVERT TALK OF

242
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,600
RACIAL HARMONY WAS VERY MUCH IN

243
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:22,200
CONFLICT WITH THE STEADY DIET OF

244
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:25,734
BARELY-DISGUISED RACIAL PANIC

245
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,533
THAT VIEWERS WERE ALSO BEING

246
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,767
FED.

247
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:30,100
PERHAPS THE MOST FLAGRANT

248
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,000
EXAMPLE OF THIS CAME ON MONDAY

249
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:32,934
NIGHT, WHEN THE RNC CHOSE TO

250
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,433
FEATURE THE ST. LOUIS COUPLE

251
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,233
WHO WAS CHARGED WITH THREATENING

252
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,343
BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTORS

253
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:36,967
AT GUNPOINT LAST MONTH.

254
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:38,400
AND THE MESSAGE THEY WERE THERE

255
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:39,934
TO SEND WAS PRETTY CLEAR.

256
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,433
IT SEEMS AS IF THE DEMOCRATS

257
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,233
NO LONGER VIEW THE GOVERNMENT'S

258
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,433
JOB AS PROTECTING HONEST

259
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,620
CITIZENS FROM CRIMINALS, BUT

260
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:48,300
RATHER PROTECTING CRIMINALS FROM

261
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,367
HONEST CITIZENS.

262
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,367
THEY'RE NOT SATISFIED WITH

263
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:52,066
SPREADING THE CHAOS AND VIOLENCE

264
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:54,166
INTO OUR COMMUNITIES.

265
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:55,934
THEY WANT TO ABOLISH THE SUBURBS

266
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,500
ALL TOGETHER BY ENDING

267
00:06:57,567 --> 00:06:59,767
SINGLE-FAMILY HOME ZONING.

268
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:00,943
THIS FORCED REZONING WOULD BRING

269
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:03,200
CRIME, LAWLESSNESS, AND

270
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:04,700
LOW-QUALITY APARTMENTS INTO

271
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:05,166
NOW-THRIVING SUBURBAN

272
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:06,567
NEIGHBORHOODS.

273
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:08,567
SO MAKE NO MISTAKE.

274
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:10,266
NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE, YOUR

275
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,800
FAMILY WILL NOT BE SAFE IN THE

276
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:14,467
RADICAL DEMOCRATS' AMERICA.

277
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:18,333
John: WOW.

278
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,734
OKAY, FIRST, C-SPAN, YOU REALLY

279
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,400
DIDN'T NEED TO PUT UP THE BANNER

280
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:20,967
THAT SAYS THEY'RE "PERSONAL

281
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:23,834
INJURY ATTORNEYS," I VERY MUCH

282
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,266
GOT THAT FROM THE EVERYTHING.

283
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,100
BUT MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY,

284
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:26,734
THINK ABOUT HOW INCENDIARY THAT

285
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,233
MESSAGE IS.

286
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,800
"VIOLENCE AND CRIMINALS ARE

287
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,042
COMING TO YOUR COMMUNITY IN THE

288
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:31,800
FORM OF "LOW-QUALITY

289
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:32,800
APARTMENTS," AND YOU MUST DEFEND

290
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:33,767
YOURSELF.

291
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,200
TAKE IT FROM US, THE COUPLE

292
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:35,867
WHO POINTED GUNS AT

293
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:38,333
BLACK LIVES MATTERS PROTESTORS."

294
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,433
AND RHETORIC LIKE THAT HAS

295
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,000
CONSEQUENCES.

296
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:44,900
WHICH ACTUALLY BRING US TO THE

297
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:46,800
SECOND PART OF OUR STORY THIS

298
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,166
WEEK: WHAT HAPPENED IN KENOSHA,

299
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:49,567
WISCONSIN, WHERE... TO REITERATE

300
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:51,000
...JACOB BLAKE WAS SHOT SEVEN

301
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:52,467
TIMES IN THE BACK BY POLICE,

302
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:53,066
WITH THREE OF HIS CHILDREN

303
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:54,033
IN THE CAR.

304
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,433
AND THEN, IN THE PROTESTS THAT

305
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
FOLLOWED, KYLE RITTENHOUSE,

306
00:07:57,567 --> 00:07:58,900
A 17-YEAR-OLD WHO HAD TRAVELED

307
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:00,076
THERE FROM OUT OF STATE, AND WAS

308
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,109
ILLEGALLY CARRYING A WEAPON,

309
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:02,333
KILLED TWO PEOPLE.

310
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,800
AND LOOK, I DON'T KNOW IF HE SAW

311
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:05,976
THE McCLOSKEYS SPEAK THE NIGHT

312
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,834
BEFORE HE CHOSE TO DRIVE TO

313
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,166
A CITY HE DIDN'T LIVE IN, TO

314
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:11,300
DEFEND PROPERTY HE DIDN'T OWN.

315
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,166
WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT HE WAS

316
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:14,393
AN AVID TRUMP SUPPORTER, EVEN

317
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:16,633
SITTING FRONT ROW AT A RALLY

318
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,433
BACK IN JANUARY.

319
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,700
AND TRUMP AND HIS MEDIA

320
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:20,266
ECOSYSTEM HAVE BEEN DELIVERING

321
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,409
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME MESSAGE AS

322
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:23,333
THE McCLOSKEYS FOR YEARS NOW.

323
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,133
JUST LOOK AT HOW QUICKLY

324
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,033
TUCKER CARLSON MOVED TO TRY AND

325
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,367
EXPLAIN AWAY RITTENHOUSE'S

326
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:29,500
ACTIONS AS A NATURAL RESPONSE.

327
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:30,967
SO ARE WE REALLY SURPRISED

328
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:32,633
THAT LOOTING AND ARSON

329
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,767
ACCELERATED TO MURDER?

330
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:36,333
HOW SHOCKED ARE WE THAT

331
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,734
17-YEAR-OLDS WITH RIFLES DECIDED

332
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,633
THEY HAD TO MAINTAIN ORDER WHEN

333
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,300
NO ONE ELSE WOULD?

334
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:43,834
John: WELL, YOU DON'T SEEM TO

335
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,834
BE SHOCKED, AND THAT ALONE

336
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,367
SHOULD BE PRETTY FUCKING

337
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:46,834
SHOCKING.

338
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,900
LET'S BE CLEAR: A 17-YEAR-OLD

339
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:50,533
VIGILANTE WITH A RIFLE CANNOT

340
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,367
MAINTAIN ORDER, BECAUSE

341
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:53,567
A 17-YEAR-OLD VIGILANTE WITH

342
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,000
A RIFLE TRYING TO MAINTAIN ORDER

343
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:56,076
IS, HIMSELF, THE DEFINITION OF

344
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,066
DISORDER.

345
00:08:58,133 --> 00:09:00,100
EXCEPT, OF COURSE, IF YOU'RE

346
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:00,734
A REGULAR VIEWER OF

347
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,667
TUCKER CARLSON, A SHOW THAT

348
00:09:01,734 --> 00:09:02,810
EXISTS TO TEACH ITS VIEWERS

349
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:03,867
PRECISELY THREE THINGS:

350
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:05,867
PROPERTY DAMAGE IS VIOLENCE,

351
00:09:05,934 --> 00:09:07,967
HOMICIDE IS ORDER,

352
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:10,500
AND PILLOWS ARE FOR SALE.

353
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:12,667
AND THE EVENTS IN KENOSHA REALLY

354
00:09:12,734 --> 00:09:13,633
HAMMER HOME THE FLAGRANT DOUBLE

355
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,600
STANDARD BAKED INTO AMERICAN

356
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:15,667
SOCIETY.

357
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:17,367
JUST LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE

358
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:18,567
IN HOW THE POLICE IN KENOSHA

359
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:20,000
RESPONDED TO BLAKE, AND HOW THEY

360
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:21,133
RESPONDED TO RITTENHOUSE.

361
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,133
ALLEGED GUNMAN

362
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,500
KYLE RITTENHOUSE WALKING AWAY,

363
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:25,967
GUN IN TOW, AS PEOPLE SCREAMED

364
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,200
THAT HE JUST SHOT PROTESTERS.

365
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:30,133
ONE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER,

366
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,567
SEEMING TO ASK RITTENHOUSE

367
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:34,467
IF ANYONE WAS HURT.

368
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,033
TWO INCIDENTS, TWO VIDEOS,

369
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,266
WITH SOME ASKING WHY TWO

370
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,734
DIFFERENT RESPONSES.

371
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,840
John: WHY TWO DIFFERENT

372
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,033
RESPONSES?

373
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,000
I THINK THE ANSWER TO THAT IS

374
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:43,533
PRETTY OBVIOUS.

375
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,840
IT'S THE SAME REASON WHY, AHEAD

376
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:45,976
OF THE SHOOTING, THERE WAS VIDEO

377
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,767
OF THE POLICE TRYING TO ENFORCE

378
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:49,467
A CURFEW AGAINST PROTESTORS,

379
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:51,333
EVEN AS THEY OFFERED WATER TO

380
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,200
RITTENHOUSE AND THE MILITIA,

381
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:53,400
SAYING, AND I QUOTE,

382
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,200
"WE APPRECIATE YOU GUYS,

383
00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:57,867
WE REALLY DO."

384
00:09:57,934 --> 00:09:58,867
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A BETTER

385
00:09:58,934 --> 00:09:59,533
VISUAL ILLUSTRATION OF THE

386
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,467
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BEING BLACK

387
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,166
AND WHITE IN AMERICA, I DON'T

388
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:04,233
THINK YOU'RE GOING TO FIND ONE,

389
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:05,734
EXCEPT MAYBE FOR SEEING EXACTLY

390
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,433
WHO SITS DOWN AND WHO STANDS UP

391
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,300
WHEN "COTTON EYED JOE" COMES ON

392
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:10,200
AT A WEDDING.

393
00:10:10,266 --> 00:10:11,409
AND THAT DISPARITY IN TREATMENT

394
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:12,834
CONTINUED EVEN AFTER THE

395
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,600
SHOOTINGS... JUST WATCH HOW,

396
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,367
THE NEXT DAY, THE KENOSHA POLICE

397
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:18,467
CHIEF COULDN'T HELP BUT SPREAD

398
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:19,300
BLAME TO THE PROTESTORS WHO WERE

399
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:20,934
SHOT AT AND KILLED.

400
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,367
EVERYBODY INVOLVED WAS OUT

401
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:23,934
AFTER THE CURFEW.

402
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,567
I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE

403
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:26,033
A GREAT DEAL OF IT.

404
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,367
BUT THE POINT IS, THE CURFEW'S

405
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:28,867
IN PLACE TO PROTECT.

406
00:10:28,934 --> 00:10:31,300
HAD PERSONS NOT BEEN OUT

407
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:32,543
INVOLVED, IN VIOLATION OF THAT,

408
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:33,607
PERHAPS THE SITUATION THAT

409
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,367
THAT UNFOLDED WOULD NOT

410
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,266
HAVE HAPPENED.

411
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,734
John: OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,

412
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,467
THANKS SO MUCH FOR NOT MAKING

413
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:40,266
A GREAT DEAL OUT OF THAT.

414
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,567
THE PEOPLE WHO GOT MURDERED

415
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:43,033
WERE UP WAY PAST THEIR

416
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,533
GOVERNMENT-IMPOSED BEDTIME AND

417
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,934
YOU WERE NICE ENOUGH NOT TO EVEN

418
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,567
MENTION IT EXCEPT TO IMPLY THAT

419
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:48,200
MAYBE IT WAS A REASON THEY KIND

420
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:50,667
OF HAD IT COMING.

421
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,000
THAT IS THE KIND OF RESTRAINT

422
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:52,700
WE'VE ALL COME TO EXPECT FROM

423
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:53,533
THE KENOSHA POLICE DEPARTMENT.

424
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,367
AND YOU MIGHT THINK,

425
00:10:57,433 --> 00:10:58,033
"WELL, HOLD ON, THAT'S JUST ONE

426
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,600
GUY.

427
00:10:58,667 --> 00:10:59,200
SURELY NOT ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT

428
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:00,433
THERE THINKS THAT WAY."

429
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,867
ALTHOUGH, I WILL POINT OUT THAT

430
00:11:01,934 --> 00:11:02,976
THE GUY STANDING NEXT TO HIM IS

431
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,667
THE KENOSHA SHERIFF, WHO, JUST

432
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:05,854
TWO YEARS AGO, GAVE A PRETTY

433
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,166
STRIKING PRESS CONFERENCE.

434
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:09,967
A GROUP OF FIVE YOUNG BLACK

435
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:11,567
PEOPLE HAD ALLEGEDLY STOLEN SOME

436
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:12,567
CLOTHING FROM AN OUTLET MALL AND

437
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:13,400
HAD LED POLICE ON A CHASE THAT

438
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:15,266
ENDED IN A MINOR CAR ACCIDENT.

439
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,400
AND IN THAT PRESS CONFERENCE,

440
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:18,233
HE EXPRESSED SOME VIEWS THAT ARE

441
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,233
PRETTY EXPLICIT.

442
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,333
LET'S PUT THEM IN JAIL.

443
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,266
LET'S... LET'S STOP THEM FROM

444
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,543
TRULY... AT LEAST SOME OF THESE

445
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:28,433
MALES GOING OUT AND GETTING

446
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,000
TEN OTHER WOMEN PREGNANT AND

447
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:30,567
HAVING SMALL CHILDREN.

448
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:34,233
LET'S PUT THEM AWAY.

449
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,567
AT SOME POINT, WE HAVE TO STOP

450
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:39,000
BEING POLITICALLY CORRECT.

451
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,400
John: SORRY, CAN I QUICKLY

452
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:40,867
INTERRUPT YOU THERE?

453
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:41,467
BECAUSE CALLING FOR AMERICAN

454
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:43,300
CITIZENS TO BE STOPPED FROM

455
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:44,527
"HAVING SMALL CHILDREN" ISN'T

456
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:45,643
"POLITICALLY INCORRECT," SO MUCH

457
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:47,700
AS "POLITICALLY 1940s GERMANY."

458
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:49,967
AND HE WASN'T JUST IDLY SAYING

459
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:50,767
THAT... HE HAD REALLY THOUGHT

460
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:54,600
THROUGH A WHOLE PLAN.

461
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:55,967
I KNOW IT IS DEEPLY UNPLEASANT,

462
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:57,176
BUT IT'S WORTH LISTENING TO JUST

463
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,567
HOW DETAILED HIS SOLUTION WAS.

464
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:01,233
IF THERE'S A THRESHOLD THAT

465
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:01,967
THEY CROSS, THESE PEOPLE HAVE

466
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:05,433
TO BE WAREHOUSED.

467
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,767
NO RECREATIONAL TIME IN THE

468
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:09,900
JAILS, WE PUT THEM AWAY.

469
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:12,967
AND MAYBE WE'VE GOT TO DO IS

470
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,153
BUILD WAREHOUSES THAT, AFTER

471
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,633
THIS GENERATION IS GONE,

472
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,800
THEY'VE PERISHED IN THESE

473
00:12:15,867 --> 00:12:16,700
BUILDINGS, WE CAN TURN THEM

474
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,567
INTO SOMETHING ELSE.

475
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:21,166
MAYBE IT'LL BE MALLS.

476
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:22,376
MAYBE, MAYBE AMAZON WILL BUY 'EM

477
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,066
AS... AS WAREHOUSES LATER.

478
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:29,066
BUT AT SOME POINT, WE HAVE TO

479
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:30,000
GET RID OF THIS GROUP OF...

480
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:31,200
WE HAVE TO LOCK THEM UP.

481
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:32,500
I DON'T THINK I'M SAYING

482
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:34,633
ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN MOST

483
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,100
PEOPLE IN SOCIETY AREN'T

484
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,433
THINKING, BUT THEY'RE AFRAID TO

485
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,367
SAY IT AND I'M JUST TO THE POINT

486
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:43,400
THAT I'M... I'M SAYING IT.

487
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:44,200
John: OKAY, IF THAT IS WHAT

488
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:45,100
MOST PEOPLE IN SOCIETY ARE

489
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,242
THINKING, WE ARE, AND THIS IS

490
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,367
TRUE, A TERRIBLE SOCIETY.

491
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:50,367
AND I HONESTLY CANNOT BELIEVE

492
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:50,867
THAT WAS AN IDEA FROM A

493
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:51,467
STILL-EMPLOYED SHERIFF,

494
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:52,633
AND NOT A PITCH FROM

495
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,433
"SHARK TANK:

496
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,266
LIGHT GENOCIDE EDITION."

497
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,734
"GOOD QUESTION, MARK CUBAN.

498
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,700
THE ANSWER IS, THESE

499
00:12:58,767 --> 00:12:59,367
CONCENTRATION CAMPS COULD EASILY

500
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:00,033
BE CONVERTED INTO

501
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,967
AMAZON WAREHOUSES.

502
00:13:01,033 --> 00:13:02,133
OOH!

503
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,242
LOOKS LIKE I'VE GOT A BIDDING

504
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:05,533
WAR ON MY HANDS!"

505
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,533
AND LOOK, THE EVENTS IN KENOSHA

506
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,066
WOULD BE INFURIATING

507
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:08,433
AT ANY TIME.

508
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,133
BUT IT'S SOMEHOW ESPECIALLY

509
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,800
INFURIATING THAT THEY TOOK PLACE

510
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:17,333
IN THE SAME WEEK WHERE THE RNC

511
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,367
DESPERATE TO REASSURE THE

512
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:20,100
COUNTRY THAT AMERICA ISN'T

513
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:20,333
RACIST,

514
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY

515
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,367
FEARMONGERING ABOUT VIOLENT

516
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:23,934
CRIME THREATENING LAW-ABIDING

517
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,967
CITIZENS.

518
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:26,834
IT'S A DISCONNECT THAT WAS

519
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,020
PRETTY WELL SUMMED UP BY NBA

520
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:30,200
COACH DOC RIVERS IN AN EMOTIONAL

521
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:33,533
POSTGAME PRESS CONFERENCE

522
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,533
ON TUESDAY.

523
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,900
WHAT STANDS OUT TO ME IS

524
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:41,734
JUST... JUST WATCHING THE

525
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,467
REPUBLICAN CONVENTION,

526
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:43,733
AND THEY'RE... THEY'RE SPEWING

527
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:44,767
THIS FEAR.

528
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,400
RIGHT?

529
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:47,633
LIKE, ALL YOU HEAR IS

530
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,467
DONALD TRUMP AND ALL OF THEM

531
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:49,433
TALKING ABOUT FEAR.

532
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,333
WE'RE THE ONES GETTING KILLED.

533
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,409
WE'RE THE ONES GETTING SHOT.

534
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:53,233
WE'RE THE ONES THAT...

535
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:53,967
WE'RE DENIED TO LIVE

536
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,600
IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES.

537
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,433
WE'VE BEEN HUNG.

538
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:04,133
WE'VE BEEN SHOT.

539
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,433
AND ALL YOU DO IS KEEP HEARING

540
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:11,233
ABOUT FEAR.

541
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,467
IT'S... IT'S AMAZING TO ME WHY

542
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:18,367
WE KEEP LOVING THIS COUNTRY AND

543
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:19,443
THIS COUNTRY DOES NOT LOVE US

544
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:20,567
BACK.

545
00:14:20,633 --> 00:14:22,734
John: YEAH, EXACTLY.

546
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,567
IT'S ALL EXHAUSTINGLY

547
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:25,900
DEPRESSING.

548
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:27,300
ALTHOUGH IN A WEEK OF INCREDIBLE

549
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,700
DARKNESS, THERE WAS ACTUALLY

550
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:31,500
A BRIGHT SPOT, BECAUSE SHORTLY

551
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:32,767
AFTER DOC RIVERS SPOKE,

552
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:33,867
SOMETHING GENUINELY

553
00:14:33,934 --> 00:14:34,867
EXTRAORDINARY STARTED

554
00:14:34,934 --> 00:14:36,166
TO HAPPEN IN HIS SPORT.

555
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:37,633
THE MILWAUKEE BUCKS HAD

556
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,600
A PLAYOFF GAME, BUT DIDN'T TAKE

557
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:40,810
THE COURT, WITH RUMORS FLYING

558
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:41,467
AROUND THAT THEY WERE ABOUT TO

559
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:42,734
REFUSE TO PLAY.

560
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,066
THEN, WNBA PLAYERS... WHO,

561
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,209
INCIDENTALLY, HAVE LED FROM THE

562
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:46,800
START ON THE BLACK LIVES MATTER

563
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:48,667
MOVEMENT... ALSO REFUSED TO

564
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:49,667
PLAY, AFTER ARRIVING AT

565
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:51,033
A SCHEDULED GAME WITH SHIRTS

566
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,109
WITH SEVEN BULLET HOLES DRAWN

567
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:54,533
ON THEIR BACK.

568
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,300
AND EVENTUALLY, WILDCAT STRIKES

569
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:57,543
SPREAD THROUGHOUT BOTH LEAGUES,

570
00:14:57,567 --> 00:14:59,467
IN AN UNPRECEDENTED, GENUINELY

571
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:00,200
INSPIRING SHOW OF COLLECTIVE

572
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,367
ACTION.

573
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,066
AND THEY DID THIS WITHOUT UNION

574
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:05,300
APPROVAL, SO THEY WERE PUTTING

575
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:06,600
A LOT ON THE LINE... THEIR

576
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:07,300
INCOME, AND MAYBE EVEN

577
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:08,400
THEIR CAREERS.

578
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:10,133
WHICH IS WHAT MAKES IT SO

579
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,333
INFURIATING THAT WHEN

580
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,100
JARED KUSHNER WAS ASKED FOR HIS

581
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,443
RESPONSE TO THE STRIKE, THIS WAS

582
00:15:14,467 --> 00:15:16,600
WHAT FELL OUT OF HIS MOUTH.

583
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,066
LOOK, I THINK THAT THE NBA

584
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:20,066
PLAYERS ARE VERY FORTUNATE THAT

585
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:20,967
THEY HAVE THE FINANCIAL POSITION

586
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:22,200
WHERE THEY'RE ABLE TO TAKE

587
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:23,600
A NIGHT OFF FROM WORK WITHOUT

588
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:24,967
HAVING TO... TO HAVE THE

589
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:25,834
CONSEQUENCES TO THEMSELVES

590
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,467
FINANCIALLY.

591
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:27,300
SO THEY HAVE THAT LUXURY,

592
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:28,934
WHICH IS GREAT.

593
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,266
John: OKAY, FIRST, GET

594
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,200
FUCKED, JARED, YOU "WELCOME TO

595
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:35,800
MARWEN" REJECT.

596
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:36,943
FOR A START, THEY'RE NOT TAKING

597
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:37,367
A NIGHT OFF FROM WORK.

598
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:38,533
THE EMOTIONAL TOLL OF BEING

599
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,934
BLACK IN AMERICA COMBINED

600
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,567
WITH THE PRESSURE T PERFORM AT

601
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:42,233
AN ELITE LEVEL DURING A

602
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,200
GLOBAL PANDEMIC IS, I'M

603
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:45,000
GUESSING, PRETTY TAXING.

604
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:46,900
SO BY NOT PLAYING, THEY'RE

605
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:49,500
NOT EXACTLY TAKING A SPA DAY.

606
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:51,033
AND IF NBA PLAYERS ARE TOO RICH

607
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,000
TO TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTION,

608
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:53,734
THEN WHO EXACTLY IS IN THE RIGHT

609
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,233
TAX BRACKET TO HAVE THEIR

610
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,900
PROTEST APPROVED BY AMERICA'S

611
00:15:56,967 --> 00:15:58,900
MOST LAMINATED PRINCE?

612
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:01,233
BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN TIME AND TIME

613
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,867
AGAIN THAT WEALTH AND FAME

614
00:16:02,934 --> 00:16:03,834
ABSOLUTELY DO NOT PROTECT YOU

615
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,233
AS A BLACK ATHLETE.

616
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,800
IT DIDN'T PROTECT STERLING BROWN

617
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:08,876
FROM GETTING TASED BY THE POLICE

618
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,066
AFTER BEING STOPPED FOR

619
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:11,467
A PARKING VIOLATION IN

620
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:13,000
MILWAUKEE, AND IT DIDN'T PROTECT

621
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:15,233
THABO SEFOLOSHA FROM HAVING HIS

622
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,066
LEG BROKEN BY NYPD OFFICERS IN

623
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:18,700
AN INCIDENT THAT FORCED HIM TO

624
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:20,166
MISS THE 2015 PLAYOFFS AND PUT

625
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:21,834
HIS WHOLE CAREER IN JEOPARDY.

626
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,900
AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO STRAP IN,

627
00:16:23,967 --> 00:16:25,100
JARED, BECAUSE THIS PROBABLY

628
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,066
ISN'T THE LAST DISRUPTIVE ACTION

629
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:26,967
LIKE THIS WE'RE GOING TO SEE

630
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:27,967
GOING FORWARD... NOR SHOULD IT

631
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:29,967
BE.

632
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:30,967
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SICK OF

633
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,233
WAITING.

634
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,900
JUST LISTEN TO JACOB BLAKE'S

635
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:35,009
SISTER, LETETRA WIDMAN, MAKING

636
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:36,633
THAT VERY CLEAR.

637
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,967
I'M NOT SAD.

638
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:39,166
I'M NOT SORRY.

639
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:41,000
I'M ANGRY.

640
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,133
AND I'M TIRED.

641
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,033
I HAVEN'T CRIED ONE TIME.

642
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,667
I STOPPED CRYING YEARS AGO.

643
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:51,467
I AM NUMB.

644
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:53,433
I HAVE BEEN WATCHING POLICE

645
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,700
MURDER PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE

646
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:56,200
ME FOR YEARS.

647
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:56,934
I'M NOT SAD.

648
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,300
I DON'T WANT YOUR PITY.

649
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,867
I WANT CHANGE.

650
00:17:01,934 --> 00:17:03,266
John: RIGHT.

651
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,633
THIS CAN'T BE ABOUT PITY.

652
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:09,233
IT CAN'T BE ABOUT SYMPATHY.

653
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,967
THAT IS WHY THERE IS NO SECTION

654
00:17:11,033 --> 00:17:11,834
IN THE GREETING CARDS STORE

655
00:17:11,934 --> 00:17:12,633
LABELED "CENTURIES OF

656
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,166
OPPRESSION."

657
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:13,867
THIS ISN'T ABOUT WHAT

658
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:14,667
WHITE PEOPLE FEEL OR SAY.

659
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:15,934
THIS HAS TO BE ABOUT CREATING

660
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,734
REAL CHANGE IN A SYSTEM THAT HAS

661
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,133
BEEN BUILT TO BE NON-RESPONSIVE.

662
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,533
BECAUSE HISTORY HAS REPEATEDLY

663
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,367
SHOWN THE SYSTEM DOESN'T RESPOND

664
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:25,700
UNTIL IT IS FORCED TO.

665
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:27,367
SO IT'S EASY FOR RNC SPEAKERS

666
00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:28,667
TO INSIST THE ONLY APPROPRIATE

667
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:29,600
ACTION IS PEACEFUL AND

668
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:30,734
UNOBTRUSIVE.

669
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,233
BUT THE FACT IS, THAT'S NOT HOW

670
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,600
IT WORKS.

671
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:36,066
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MARCHED

672
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:37,276
IN THE WAKE OF GEORGE FLOYD'S

673
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,934
DEATH, AND HAVE CONTINUED

674
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:40,209
MARCHING, EVEN AS MEDIA COVERAGE

675
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:41,867
HAS STEADILY DRIFTED AWAY.

676
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:43,367
MEANWHILE, THE NBA HAS MADE

677
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:45,200
A LOT OF SYMBOLIC GESTURES OF

678
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:46,900
SUPPORT FOR THE MOVEMENT, LIKE

679
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:47,734
PAINTING "BLACK LIVES MATTER"

680
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,100
ON THE COURT AND ALLOWING

681
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,309
PLAYERS TO WEAR A SOCIAL JUSTICE

682
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,066
MESSAGE ON THEIR JERSEYS,

683
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:54,233
SELECTED FROM A LIST OF

684
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,033
29 AGREED-UPON OPTIONS.

685
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,667
BUT TO UNDERSCORE JUST HOW

686
00:17:57,734 --> 00:17:59,567
LIMITING THAT KIND OF

687
00:17:59,633 --> 00:18:01,166
"PREAPPROVED" PROTEST CAN BE,

688
00:18:01,233 --> 00:18:03,567
"SAY HER NAME" WAS ON THE LIST,

689
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:05,200
BUT "BREONNA TAYLOR" WAS NOT.

690
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:07,033
AND I GUESS THE ONLY POSITIVE

691
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,140
THING THERE IS, IF PLAYERS

692
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,834
WANTED TO PROTEST THAT

693
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,734
RESTRICTION, THE NBA HAD

694
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,934
A JERSEY READY MADE FOR THEM.

695
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,834
THE PROBLEM WITH PURELY SYMBOLIC

696
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,433
PROTEST IS THAT IT'S FAR TOO

697
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,100
EASY TO CO-OPT.

698
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,333
THERE MIGHT BE NO MORE VISCERAL

699
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,567
EXAMPLE OF THAT THAN THE FACT

700
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,834
THAT THAT KENOSHA SHERIFF AND

701
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,767
HUMAN WAREHOUSING INNOVATOR GOT

702
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:27,100
POSITIVE ATTENTION EARLIER THIS

703
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,767
YEAR WHEN HE KNEELED FOR NINE

704
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:29,967
MINUTES IN SOLIDARITY WITH

705
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:33,467
THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT.

706
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:34,767
SO IS IT ANY WONDER THAT

707
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:36,467
BASKETBALL PLAYERS FELT THEY HAD

708
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,633
TO ESCALATE THEIR PROTEST BY NOT

709
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,633
JUST WEARING A JERSEY, BUT

710
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,033
BY STRIKING...

711
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,100
AND IN DOING SO, PUTTING TEAM

712
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,400
OWNERS MONEY AT JEOPARDY.

713
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:51,333
BECAUSE REAL DISCOMFORT IS THE

714
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,609
ONLY THING THAT'S GOING TO BRING

715
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:53,500
REAL CHANGE HERE.

716
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,500
AND IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT

717
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,633
ALREADY, THE STRIKE HAS HAD SOME

718
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:56,867
EFFECT.

719
00:18:56,934 --> 00:18:58,567
NOT ONLY DID THE STRIKE SPREAD

720
00:18:58,633 --> 00:18:59,633
TO OTHER SPORTS AND OTHER

721
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,467
ATHLETES, BUT THE NBA PLAYERS

722
00:19:00,533 --> 00:19:01,676
NOW HAVE A PROMISE FROM OWNERS

723
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,533
TO CONVERT AS MANY OF THEIR

724
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,367
ARENAS AS POSSIBLE INTO

725
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,734
POLLING PLACES THIS NOVEMBER.

726
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,080
WHICH IS GREAT, ALTHOUGH IT ALSO

727
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:07,533
BRINGS US TO THE FACT THAT

728
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,233
SIMPLY VOTING THIS NOVEMBER IS

729
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,476
CLEARLY NOT GOING TO BE NEARLY

730
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,900
ENOUGH.

731
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:13,042
BECAUSE AS MUCH AS I OR THE RNC

732
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:14,500
WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT

733
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:17,066
JOE BIDEN WILL BE AN AGENT OF

734
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:19,200
RADICAL CHANGE, THERE IS JUST

735
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:20,600
NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT.

736
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:22,200
TO THE EXTENT THAT REAL CHANGE

737
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:24,100
IS POSSIBLE THROUGH THE BALLOT

738
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,209
BOX THIS YEAR, IT WILL BE IF

739
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:27,934
BIDEN IS ELECTED ALONGSIDE

740
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,142
PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATES ALL DOWN

741
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,300
THE BALLOT, FROM THE SENATE

742
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:31,476
TO STATE LEGISLATURES TO CITY

743
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,200
COUNCILS TO SHERIFFS.

744
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:36,767
AND EVEN THAT WILL BE VERY MUCH

745
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:38,266
A BEGINNING AND NOT AN END.

746
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,934
NONE OF THIS IS EASY.

747
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,667
BUT IT HAS TO BEGIN, AND NOW.

748
00:19:42,734 --> 00:19:44,014
BECAUSE OUR CURRENT SITUATION IS

749
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:44,600
COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.

750
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:47,000
AND THE RNC THIS WEEK ACTUALLY

751
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:48,834
ENDED UP BEING A PRETTY GOOD

752
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,333
REMINDER THAT WHERE WE STILL

753
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,409
MIGHT END UP GOING IS GENUINELY

754
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:53,066
TERRIFYING.

755
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:54,767
BECAUSE IF IT SHOWED US ONE

756
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:56,133
THING THIS WEEK, IT'S THE DANGER

757
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,500
IN CONTINUING TO BE GOVERNED

758
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,367
BY AN ADMINISTRATION THAT

759
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:00,609
ENCOURAGES THE UGLIEST FORCES IN

760
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,400
AMERICAN SOCIETY, THAT LIONIZES

761
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:03,667
THREATS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST

762
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:05,100
PEACEFUL PROTEST, THAT TELLS US

763
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,800
THERE IS NO CONFLICT BETWEEN

764
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:09,266
SUPPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

765
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,667
"OUR AFRICAN-AMERICAN

766
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:11,810
NEIGHBORS," AND THAT INSISTS

767
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:12,533
THAT THE "BEST IS YET TO COME,"

768
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,734
WHICH, GIVEN EVERYTHING WE'VE

769
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,166
SEEN IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS, IS

770
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:17,767
SOUNDING LESS LIKE A PROMISE AND

771
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:19,300
MORE LIKE A FUCKING THREAT.

772
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:20,300
AND NOW THIS.

773
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:21,066

774

MR. PRESIDENT AND

809
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:41,433
MR. VICE PRESIDENT, YOU ARE

810
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,033
REHIRED.

811
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,133
John: MOVING ON.

812
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,967
FINALLY TONIGHT, A QUICK UPDATE

813
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:48,109
ABOUT DANBURY, CONNECTICUT.

814
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:48,633
ALSO KNOWN AS THE HAT CITY,

815
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,500
WHICH IS APPROPRIATE, BECAUSE

816
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:50,333
MUCH LIKE THE BOWLER HAT,

817
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,500
DANBURY IS A SUPERFLUOUS

818
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:52,233
ACCESSORY WITH NO PRACTICAL

819
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:52,967
PURPOSE THAT WENT OUT OF STYLE

820
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:54,834
IN THE 1930s.

821
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,667
NOW YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED, I'VE

822
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,300
TAKEN A FEW CHEAP SHOTS LIKE

823
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:00,166
THAT AT THE CITY OF DANBURY OVER

824
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:00,900
THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.

825
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:01,976
AND PERHAPS UNSURPRISINGLY, THE

826
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,667
PEOPLE THERE HAVE TAKEN NOTICE.

827
00:22:02,734 --> 00:22:05,200
OLIVER DELIVERED A SCATHING

828
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:08,266
SIDEBAR SMACKDOWN ABOUT DANBURY.

829
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:08,900
AND THIS IS THE CLOSEST SNIPPET

830
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:09,467
THAT WE COULD AIR WITHOUT

831
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:10,367
GETTING OUR FCC LICENSE PULLED.

832
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:14,133
WATCH THIS.

833
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,376
John: 'CAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING

834
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,409
TO FORGET A TOWN IN CONNECTICUT,

835
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:17,367
WHY NOT FORGET DANBURY?

836
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:21,367
BECAUSE, AND THIS IS TRUE,

837
00:22:21,433 --> 00:22:22,166
[BLEEP] DANBURY.

838
00:22:22,233 --> 00:22:23,033
I KNOW EXACTLY THREE THINGS

839
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,033
ABOUT DANBURY: "USA TODAY"

840
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,109
RANKED IT THE SECOND-BEST CITY

841
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:26,967
TO LIVE IN IN 2015, IT WAS ONCE

842
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:28,233
THE CENTER OF THE AMERICAN HAT

843
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,533
INDUSTRY... AND IF YOU'RE FROM

844
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,834
THERE, YOU'VE GOT A STANDING

845
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,600
INVITE TO COME GET A THRASHING

846
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:32,266
FROM JOHN OLIVER.

847
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:35,166
CHILDREN INCLUDED.

848
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:36,700
YEAH, THERE WAS... YOU SHOULD

849
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:40,767
WATCH THE CLIP, THERE'S NOT,

850
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,533
LIKE I SAID, AS... AS MY

851
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,840
PRODUCER JOHN SAYS, THERE'S NOT

852
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:44,600
A LOT... THERE'S A LOT OF BLEEPS

853
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:45,500
IN THAT ONE.

854
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:46,433
John: OKAY, DID I TELL

855
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,609
DANBURY, A SEEMINGLY CHARMING,

856
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:48,133
RANDOM CITY IN CONNECTICUT,

857
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,633
TO GO FUCK ITSELF?

858
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,900
YEAH, YEAH, I DID.

859
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:52,834
DID I INVITE EVERYONE WHO LIVED

860
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,533
THERE TO COME GET A THRASHING

861
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,433
FROM ME?

862
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
I CAN'T DENY THAT.

863
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:56,266
THE ONLY THING HE'S TECHNICALLY

864
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:56,934
WRONG ABOUT IS WHEN HE SAYS

865
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,834
THERE WERE A LOT OF BLEEPS IN

866
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:03,767
THAT CLIP.

867
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:05,200
BECAUSE I ONLY HEARD ONE BLEEP.

868
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:06,166
THE SECOND TIME I SAID

869
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:06,967
"FUCK DANBURY" THE AUDIO SEEMED

870
00:23:07,033 --> 00:23:07,734
TO CUT OUT.

871
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,467
AND I'M WILLING TO ASSUME THAT

872
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:09,600
WAS OUR FAULT.

873
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:10,433
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER: THIS

874
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,509
NETWORK IS OPERATED BY AT&T.

875
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:12,676
THAT'S RIGHT, BUSINESS DADDY!

876
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,200
GUESS WHO'S SWINGING AGAIN!

877
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:16,266
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE

878
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:16,934
WE'VE SPOKEN, HASN'T IT?

879
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,700
HOW ARE THINGS WITH YOU?

880
00:23:17,767 --> 00:23:18,876
ME, I'M JUST SHELTERING IN A

881
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,367
VOID, FIGHTING WITH SOME

882
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:20,100
ZIP CODES IN CONNECTICUT AND

883
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:20,934
MAY OR MAY NOT WISH TO

884
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,433
BE MURDERED BY THE COSTAR OF

885
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:22,834
"MARRIAGE STORY."

886
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,700
IT'S BEEN A WEIRD FEW MONTHS.

887
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:24,633
WE'VE GOT LOTS TO CATCH UP ON...

888
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,467
WE SHOULD PROBABLY TALK ON THE

889
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:26,867
PHONE MORE, BUT I DO REALIZE

890
00:23:26,934 --> 00:23:29,834
THAT'S A BIG ASK FOR YOU.

891
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,300
AND LOOK, I DID THINK THE PEOPLE

892
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:32,376
OF DANBURY WOULD TAKE ISSUE WITH

893
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,200
WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING.

894
00:23:34,266 --> 00:23:36,166
I DIDN'T EXPECT THEM TO SIMPLY

895
00:23:36,233 --> 00:23:37,667
SIT THERE AND COWER IN FEAR OF

896
00:23:37,734 --> 00:23:38,567
MY FISTS, PAUL HOLLYWOOD AND

897
00:23:38,633 --> 00:23:40,834
MARY BERRY.

898
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,060
WHAT I DIDN'T EXPECT WAS JUST

899
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,633
HOW GREAT THEIR RESPONSE WOULD

900
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,500
BE.

901
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:44,967
BECAUSE DANBURY, AS ONE,

902
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:46,233
HAS RISEN UP AND FOUGHT BACK

903
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,467
MAGNIFICENTLY.

904
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:49,333
TAKE THIS SURPRISINGLY

905
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,600
WELL-PRODUCED RESPONSE FROM A

906
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:53,967
CHILD WHO LIVES THERE:

907
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:57,233
SO ACCORDING TO MY MOM, HBO'S

908
00:23:57,333 --> 00:24:01,667
COMEDIAN JOHN OLIVER...

909
00:24:01,734 --> 00:24:03,834
JOHN OLIVER THREW SOME SHADE ON

910
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,767
WHAT DANBURY HAS TO OFFER.

911
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:12,834
THE THINGS YOU MENTIONED ABOUT

912
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,000
DANBURY ARE SO YESTERDAY, LIKE

913
00:24:15,066 --> 00:24:17,500
AN ARTICLE FROM 2015.

914
00:24:17,567 --> 00:24:19,767
I WAS, LIKE, THREE-YEARS-OLD

915
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:20,500
WHEN THAT CAME OUT!

916
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:21,333
THREE!

917
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,834
John: WOW!

918
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,834
THAT KID CAME IN HOT!

919
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,900
AND THAT IS ALL GOOD.

920
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:29,767
THE ONLY THING I OBJECT

921
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:30,433
TO WAS HIM PUTTING MY NAME

922
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,266
IN AIR QUOTES.

923
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,000
BECAUSE, COME ON, KID!

924
00:24:32,066 --> 00:24:33,266
THIS IS MY ACTUAL NAME!

925
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,443
IF I WAS GOING TO MAKE ONE UP,

926
00:24:34,467 --> 00:24:35,576
I WOULDN'T CHOOSE SOMETHING THAT

927
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,166
MAKES ME SOUND LIKE A DICKENSIAN

928
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:37,934
CARICATURE.

929
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,042
I'D PICK SOMETHING INCREDIBLE

930
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:40,533
LIKE J-SUAVE OR

931
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,734
BIG JOHNNY TWO-SOUPS.

932
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,567
ALSO, FOR THE RECORD, THAT IS

933
00:24:45,633 --> 00:24:46,800
THE FIRST TIME ANYONE'S EVER

934
00:24:46,867 --> 00:24:48,967
LANDED A SUCCESSFUL BURN THAT

935
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:49,500
STARTED WITH THE PHRASE,

936
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:51,233
"ACCORDING TO MY MOM."

937
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,967
KUDOS, KID.

938
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,109
BUT THAT BOY WASN'T DANBURY'S

939
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:54,400
ONLY DEFENDER.

940
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:55,509
THERE WAS ALSO THIS OFFICIAL

941
00:24:55,533 --> 00:24:56,266
RESPONSE FROM THE DANBURY HAT

942
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:56,867
TRICKS, THEIR LOCAL PRO HOCKEY

943
00:24:56,934 --> 00:24:57,767
TEAM.

944
00:24:57,834 --> 00:24:59,000
JOHN MAKES SEVERAL VALID

945
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:00,467
POINTS.

946
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:01,613
OUR RAILWAY MUSEUM IS QUITE

947
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,533
CHARMING, AND WE DO WEAR OUR

948
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,433
"HAT CITY" MONIKER PROUDLY.

949
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,609
HE DID HIS RESEARCH LIKE ANY

950
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:07,233
INTREPID REPORTER SHOULD, WHICH

951
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,133
HE IS.

952
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,734
THAT IS, WHEN HE'S NOT TAKING

953
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,867
BREAKS TO FILM SUCH CINEMATIC

954
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:13,667
CLASSICS AS "THE SMURFS,"

955
00:25:13,734 --> 00:25:17,900
"WONDER PARK," OR MY PERSONAL

956
00:25:17,967 --> 00:25:19,600
FAVORITE, AND THIS IS TRUE, HIS

957
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:20,300
ICONIC ROLE AS DICK PANTS IN THE

958
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:21,100
"LOVE GURU."

959
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:22,967
THERE IS ONE AREA, THOUGH, WHERE

960
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:24,042
JOHN DID NOT DO HIS HOMEWORK,

961
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:25,242
AND THAT IS, OF COURSE, THE IDEA

962
00:25:25,266 --> 00:25:26,500
THAT HE COULD GIVE ANYONE IN

963
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:27,767
DANBURY A "THRASHING."

964
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:29,934
John: AGAIN, VERY GOOD.

965
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,467
HONESTLY, DANBURY MIGHT WANT TO

966
00:25:31,533 --> 00:25:32,710
SERIOUSLY CONSIDER CHANGING ITS

967
00:25:32,734 --> 00:25:33,943
NICKNAME FROM "THE HAT CITY," TO

968
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,667
"THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO SEEM MORE

969
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:36,876
THAN CAPABLE OF TAKING OVER MY

970
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,367
JOB" CITY.

971
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:39,000
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE WHY THEY'D

972
00:25:39,066 --> 00:25:41,734
WANT IT.

973
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,633
YES, WE BOTH LIVE IN SAD, EMPTY

974
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,333
VOIDS WHERE HOPE GOES TO DIE,

975
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,266
BUT AT LEAST DANBURY HAS

976
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:45,266
A RAILWAY MUSEUM.

977
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:46,834
WE HAVEN'T HAD ONE OF THOSE

978
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,734
SINCE SEASON FOUR.

979
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,200
BUT THE STRONGEST RESPONSE BY

980
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:51,376
FAR ACTUALLY CAME FROM THE MAYOR

981
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,934
OF DANBURY HIMSELF.

982
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,667
BEHIND ME, YOU'LL SEE THE

983
00:25:56,734 --> 00:25:58,867
CITY OF DANBURY SEWER PLANT, AND

984
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:00,166
WE ARE GONNA RENAME IT THE

985
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:00,734
"JOHN OLIVER MEMORIAL SEWER

986
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,333
PLANT."

987
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:08,166
WHY?

988
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,133
BECAUSE IT'S FULL OF [BLEEP]

989
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,900
JUST LIKE YOU, JOHN.

990
00:26:10,967 --> 00:26:11,767
John: EXCELLENT.

991
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:13,200
SIMPLY EXCELLENT.

992
00:26:13,266 --> 00:26:14,509
JUST CALLING IT THE "JOHN OLIVER

993
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:15,333
SEWER PLANT" WOULD HAVE

994
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,567
COMFORTABLY BEEN ENOUGH.

995
00:26:16,633 --> 00:26:17,300
THEY WENT A STEP FARTHER AND

996
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,767
WENT WITH THE "JOHN OLIVER

997
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:19,633
"MEMORIAL" SEWER PLANT," WHICH

998
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,567
IS COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE,

999
00:26:20,633 --> 00:26:21,967
BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM THAT I'VE

1000
00:26:22,033 --> 00:26:23,076
JUST BEEN MURDERED BY THE CITY

1001
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,467
OF DANBURY.

1002
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:25,400
AND I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT

1003
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:26,400
THIS, NOT JUST BECAUSE THAT'S

1004
00:26:26,467 --> 00:26:27,587
A SUPERB JOKE, BUT BECAUSE I

1005
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:28,967
KNOW JUST HOW VALUABLE THAT

1006
00:26:29,066 --> 00:26:31,967
POOP FACTORY IS TO DANBURY.

1007
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:34,967
WE DUG INTO THEIR 2019-2020

1008
00:26:35,033 --> 00:26:36,042
ADOPTED BUDGET AND FOUND THAT

1009
00:26:36,066 --> 00:26:36,834
DANBURY'S SEWER SYSTEM WAS BY

1010
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,700
FAR THE MOST EXPENSIVE PUBLIC

1011
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:38,533
UTILITY PROJECT FOR THAT

1012
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,133
FISCAL YEAR.

1013
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,533
THEY SPENT $103 MILLION DOLLARS

1014
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,133
UPGRADING IT, MORE THAN 20 TIMES

1015
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,400
THEIR NEXT BUDGET ITEM.

1016
00:26:47,467 --> 00:26:48,166
AND NORMALLY, I'D MAKE SOME EASY

1017
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:49,276
JOKE ABOUT DANBURY BEING A TOWN

1018
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,409
SO BACKED UP WITH SHIT THAT IT

1019
00:26:50,433 --> 00:26:52,467
HAD TO SPEND NINE FIGURES ON

1020
00:26:52,533 --> 00:26:54,033
FIXING THEIR SEWAGE SYSTEM, BUT

1021
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,734
THE TRUTH IS, MY OPINION OF THE

1022
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,233
CITY HAS NOW CHANGED.

1023
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,667
PREVIOUSLY, I'D HAVE SEEN THIS

1024
00:26:58,734 --> 00:27:00,867
IMAGE OF A MINK ABOUT TO DIVE

1025
00:27:00,934 --> 00:27:02,166
INTO CANDLEWOOD LAKE, AND

1026
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:02,800
ASSUMED IT WAS UNDERSTANDABLY

1027
00:27:02,867 --> 00:27:04,133
TRYING TO DROWN ITSELF BECAUSE

1028
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,633
OF ITS PROXIMITY TO DANBURY.

1029
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,700
BUT NOW I KNOW THAT'S SIMPLY

1030
00:27:11,767 --> 00:27:11,900
WRONG.

1031
00:27:11,967 --> 00:27:12,600
THAT MINK'S PROBABLY GOT A

1032
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:13,667
DECENT YOUTUBE SHOW...

1033
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,567
EVERYONE IN DANBURY SEEMS TO.

1034
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,633
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE PLACE.

1035
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:16,500
AND THE TRUTH IS, THINGS HAVE

1036
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:18,233
BEEN SO BLEAK RECENTLY, I NEEDED

1037
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,300
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

1038
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,200
SOMETHING TO RESTORE MY FAITH

1039
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:25,333
IN HUMAN NATURE.

1040
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,233
AND THAT IS WHY I WAS SO

1041
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,533
INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED TO

1042
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,266
THEN SEE THIS.

1043
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:29,967
OUR VIDEO IS IN JEST.

1044
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:31,533
WE'RE NOT REALLY GONNA NAME THE

1045
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,133
SEWER PLANT AFTER JOHN OLIVER.

1046
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,433
HOWEVER, HE STILL IS FULL OF

1047
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,500
[BLEEP], SO I'LL STICK BY THAT.

1048
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:39,500
John: WAIT, SO YOU'RE NOT

1049
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:40,567
DOING IT?

1050
00:27:40,633 --> 00:27:41,533
OH, FUCK YOU, DANBURY!

1051
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,467
YOU HAD THE FIRST GOOD IDEA

1052
00:27:42,533 --> 00:27:44,600
IN YOUR CITY'S HISTORY AND

1053
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:45,400
YOU CHICKENED OUT ON THE

1054
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,734
FOLLOW THROUGH?

1055
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,500
WHAT A CLASSIC DANBURY MOVE.

1056
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:48,734
LISTEN.

1057
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,433
I DIDN'T KNOW I WANTED MY NAME

1058
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,400
ON YOUR SHIT FACTORY, BUT NOW

1059
00:27:51,467 --> 00:27:55,500
THAT YOU'VE FLOATED IT AS AN

1060
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:56,467
OPTION, IT IS ALL I WANT.

1061
00:27:56,533 --> 00:27:57,576
SO LET'S GET DOWN TO BRASS TACKS

1062
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,643
HERE, BECAUSE I'VE GOT A VERY

1063
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:01,200
SERIOUS PROPOSITION.

1064
00:28:01,266 --> 00:28:02,333

MAYOR MAKES GOOD ON HIS PROMISE

00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,266
TO OFFICIALLY NAME THAT SEWAGE

1078
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,000

I NEED THIS.

AND IF YOUR MAYOR IS THINKING,

1082
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:29,700
"HOLD ON... THAT SIGN WAS JUST A

1083
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:30,233
PHOTOSHOP.

1084
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,467
I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND PUBLIC

1085
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:34,700
MONEY TO MAKE A REAL ONE"...

1086
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:38,567
DON'T WORRY, THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN

1087
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,266
CARE OF FOR YOU.

1088
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:40,343

I'M TALKING ABOUT MILFORD.

00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:56,800
I'M EVEN TALKING ABOUT

1102
00:28:56,867 --> 00:28:59,200
TORRINGTON.

00:28:59,233 --> 00:29:04,333

YOUR MOVE.

1112
