1
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,880
HI THERE!

2
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,880
WELCOME TO THE SHOW!

3
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,880
STILL COMING TO YOU FROM THIS

4
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,880
BLANK VOID, WHICH I DON'T THINK

5
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,880
IS PURGATORY, BUT I CAN'T PROVE

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,880
OTHERWISE.

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,880
AND WE'RE GOING TO JUMP STRAIGHT

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,880
IN WITH OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT,

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,880
WHICH UNFORTUNATELY, FOR THE

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,880
SECOND WEEK IN A ROW, CONCERNS

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,880
THE ELECTION WE JUST HAD.

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,880
AND BELIEVE ME, I'M JUST AS

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,880
DISAPPOINTED AS YOU ABOUT THAT.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,880
I'D MUCH RATHER SPEND TONIGHT

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,880
TALKING ABOUT THIS RARE TURTLE

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,880
FOUND IN WEST BENGAL.

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,880
LOOK HOW YELLOW IT IS!

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,880
IT LOOKS LIKE IT GOT INTO SOME

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,660
TROUBLE WITH THE TURTLE MAFIA

20
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,880
AND IS NOW TRYING TO DISGUISE

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,880
ITSELF AS A PEANUT M&M.

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,880
IT LOOKS LIKE IT WENT TO A

23
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,880
COSTUME PARTY DRESSED AS "THE

24
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,880
LESS HEALTHY PART OF THE EGG."

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,880
ACCORDING TO EXPERTS, "THE RARE

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,880
COLOR OF THE TURTLE IS

27
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,880
ATTRIBUTED TO THE DEFICIENCY OF

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,880
PIGMENT CALLED TYROSINE," BUT

29
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,880
ACCORDING TO ME, YOU CAN GO

30
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,480
AHEAD AND DROP THAT LITTLE

31
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,900
FACTOID IN A FILE LABELED "WHO

32
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,860
GIVES A SHIT" BECAUSE LOOK AT

33
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,880
HOW FUCKING YELLOW THAT TURTLE

34
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,880
IS!

35
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,880
WE COULD'VE DONE THIS WHOLE SHOW

36
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,880
ABOUT THIS SHINY, CHEDDAR CHEESE

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,880
MISTAKE, BUT INSTEAD, WE HAVE TO

38
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,880
TALK ABOUT THIS ASSHOLE.

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,880
BECAUSE IN NORMAL TIMES, THE

40
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,880
LOSER OF A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

41
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,880
WOULD SIMPLY ACKNOWLEDGE THEY

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,880
LOST AND THE COUNTRY WOULD GET

43
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,880
TO MOVE ON.

44
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,880
BUT AS OF OUR TAPING ON

45
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,880
SATURDAY, A FULL WEEK AFTER THE

46
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,880
ELECTION WAS CALLED, TRUMP IS

47
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,880
STILL REFUSING TO CONCEDE THE

48
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,880
ELECTION.

49
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,880
AND WHILE THAT'S NOT REMOTELY

50
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,899
SURPRISING, WHAT HAS BEEN

51
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,860
DISAPPOINTING HAS BEEN THIS

52
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:42,920
SHIT.

53
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:44,480
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE

54
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,880
POMPEO SENT SHOCK WAVES WHEN HE

55
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,880
APPEARED TO DISMISS THE ELECTION

56
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,880
RESULTS.

57
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,420
THERE WILL BE A SMOOTH

58
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:49,920
TRANSITION TO A SECOND TRUMP

59
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:55,899
ADMINISTRATION.

60
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:55,920
WE ARE READY.

61
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:57,899
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU

62
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:57,918
TALKING ABOUT, YOU BUSINESS

63
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:58,880
GRIMACE?

64
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,880
YOU'RE THE SECRETARY OF STATE.

65
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,880
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FORCEFULLY

66
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,880
DENOUNCE COUPS AND LOOK THE

67
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,899
OTHER WAY IF THE CIA DOES ONE IN

68
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,860
CENTRAL OR SOUTH AMERICA.

69
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,880
THAT'S LITERALLY YOUR WHOLE JOB.

70
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,880
AND WHILE SOME HAVE SUGGESTED

71
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,880
POMPEO WAS JOKING THERE, HE ALSO

72
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,880
HASN'T YET ACKNOWLEDGED THAT

73
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,880
BIDEN IS PRESIDENT-ELECT.

74
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,880
NOR HAVE MOST REPUBLICANS.

75
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,880
MITCH McCONNELL NOT ONLY CLAIMED

76
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,880
TRUMP IS "100% WITHIN HIS

77
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,880
RIGHTS" TO CHALLENGE THE

78
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,160
ELECTION RESULTS, HE WENT ON TO

79
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,880
LET'S NOT HAVE ANY LECTURES,

80
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,880
NO LECTURES, ABOUT HOW THE

81
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,880
PRESIDENT SHOULD IMMEDIATELY,

82
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,880
CHEERFULLY ACCEPT PRELIMINARY

83
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,880
ELECTION RESULTS FROM THE SAME

84
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,880
CHARACTERS WHO JUST SPENT FOUR

85
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,880
YEARS REFUSING TO ACCEPT THE

86
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,880
VALIDITY OF THE LAST ELECTION.

87
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,880
NO ONE

88
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,880
EXPECTED TRUMP TO "IMMEDIATELY,

89
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,880
CHEERFULLY ACCEPT" THE RESULTS.

90
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,880
HE'S INCAPABLE OF CHEERFULLY

91
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,880
ACCEPTING ANYTHING APART FROM

92
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,880
BLOWJOBS, NAZI ENDORSEMENTS, AND

93
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,880
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SCREAM INSIDE

94
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,880
A STRANGER'S TRUCK.

95
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,899
WHOSE TRUCK IS THAT?

96
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:49,920
I'LL TELL YOU WHO DEFINITELY

97
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:51,880
THIS GUY.

98
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,880
IT'S HIS TRUCK NOW.

99
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,880
HONK HONK!

100
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,880
AND SECOND, WHILE THERE WERE

101
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,880
SOME ON THE LEFT IN 2016 WHO

102
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,880
URGED FIGHTING THE RESULTS,

103
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,880
HILLARY FORMALLY CONCEDED THE

104
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,880
DAY AFTER THE ELECTION, AND

105
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,880
OBAMA HAD TRUMP IN THE WHITE

106
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,880
HOUSE THE DAY AFTER THAT.

107
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,880
AND YET, REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING

108
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,880
TO DEFEND THEIR SUPPORT FOR

109
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,880
TRUMP'S INDEFENSIBLE BEHAVIOR,

110
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,880
WITH ONE SENIOR OFFICIAL SAYING,

111
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,880
"WHAT IS THE DOWNSIDE OF

112
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,880
HUMORING HIM FOR THIS LITTLE BIT

113
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,880
OF TIME?"

114
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,880
A QUESTION THAT NEVER ENDS WELL,

115
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,880
WHETHER THE ONES ASKING IT ARE

116
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,880
OVERWORKED PARENTS WHO NEED A

117
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,880
BREAK OR THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC.

118
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,880
SO TONIGHT, LET'S LOOK AT JUST

119
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,880
HOW WEAK TRUMP'S CASE FOR

120
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,880
OVERTURNING THIS ELECTION IS AND

121
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,880
WHAT REAL HARM HUMORING HIM WILL

122
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,880
DO.

123
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,880
AND LET'S START WITH THE CASE

124
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,880
ITSELF, BECAUSE THERE ARE LOTS

125
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,880
OF ACCUSATIONS AND LAWSUITS

126
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,880
FLYING AROUND, AND IF YOU'RE A

127
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,880
CASUAL VIEWER OF RIGHT-WING

128
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,880
MEDIA, YOU MIGHT THINK, "WELL,

129
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,880
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING HERE.

130
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,900
THEY WOULDN'T BE GOING TO ALL

131
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:42,920
THIS TROUBLE OVER NOTHING."

132
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:44,880
BUT THE THING IS, THEY ARE.

133
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,880
THIS REALLY IS NOTHING.

134
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,880
AND LET'S START WITH THE

135
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,880
FREQUENTLY MADE CLAIM ABOUT DEAD

136
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,880
VOTERS.

137
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,880
IF YOUR UNCLE IS A NIGHTMARE AND

138
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,880
YOU'RE STILL FRIENDS ON

139
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,840
FACEBOOK, YOU MIGHT'VE SEEN THIS

140
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,880
POST CLAIMING THERE WAS A LIST

141
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,880
OF 14,000 DEAD PEOPLE WHO VOTED

142
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,880
IN MICHIGAN.

143
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,880
BUT WHEN CNN PICKED OUT 50 OF

144
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,880
THOSE NAMES TO DO A SPOT CHECK,

145
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,880
THEY DISCOVERED 37 WERE DEAD AND

146
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,880
HADN'T CAST VOTES, 5 HAD VOTED

147
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,880
BUT WERE STILL ALIVE, AND 8 WERE

148
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,780
ALIVE BUT HADN'T VOTED, MEANING

149
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,900
EXACTLY ZERO WERE DEAD PEOPLE

150
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,500
WHO VOTED.

151
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,880
AND YES, THAT IS JUST A SAMPLE,

152
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,880
BUT IF YOU WERE AT AN OREO

153
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,880
FACTORY AND 50 OUT OF 50 OREOS

154
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,880
YOU PICKED OFF THE LINE WERE

155
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,880
JUST TWO RATS SQUISHED AROUND A

156
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,880
USED CONDOM, YOU MIGHT WELL NOT

157
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,880
RISK TRUSTING THE NEXT COOKIE

158
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,120
THAT COMES PAST YOU.

159
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,880
THE CLAIM OF DEAD PEOPLE VOTING

160
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,880
WAS ALSO ADVANCED BY

161
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,880
TUCKER CARLSON, AN '80s

162
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,880
SKI BULLY WHO JUST LOST THE BIG

163
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,880
RACE, AND HE WENT IN BIG ON ONE

164
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,880
EXAMPLE IN PARTICULAR.

165
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,880
IN SOME WAYS, IT'S AN

166
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,880
INSPIRING STORY.

167
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,899
THE TRIUMPH OF VOTING OVER

168
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:42,920
DEATH.

169
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:44,880
AND NO ONE QUITE EMBODIES THAT

170
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,880
STORY LIKE JAMES BLALOCK OF

171
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,880
COVINGTON, GEORGIA.

172
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,880
MR. BLALOCK WAS A MAILMAN FOR

173
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,660
33 YEARS UNTIL HE PASSED AWAY

174
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,880
IN 2006.

175
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,899
14 YEARS LATER, ACCORDING TO

176
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,860
STATE RECORDS, HE WAS STILL

177
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,880
MAILING THINGS.

178
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,880
JAMES BLALOCK CAST A BALLOT IN

179
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,880
LAST WEEK'S ELECTION.

180
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,880
HOW DID HE DO THAT?

181
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,880
OOH, THAT'S AN

182
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,880
EXCELLENT QUESTION, YOU WAITER'S

183
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,880
NIGHTMARE.

184
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,880
NOW THAT SEGMENT GOT PICKED UP

185
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,880
AND CIRCULATED BY, AMONG OTHERS,

186
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,360
MATT GAETZ AND THE TRUMP

187
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,880
CAMPAIGN ITSELF.

188
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,880
HOW

189
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,300
DID THAT DEAD MAN VOTE?

190
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,880
MAYBE HIS WIDOW HAS AN ANSWER.

191
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,880
HE DIDN'T VOTE.

192
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,880
IT WAS YOU!

193
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,880
IT WAS ME.

194
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,840
AGNES BLALOCK VOTED USING HER

195
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:23,920
MARRIED NAME, NEWTON COUNTY

196
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:25,880
CONFIRMED.

197
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,880
HER VOTER REGISTRATION WAS

198
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,880
SIGNED AS "MRS. JAMES E. BLALOCK

199
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,880
JR."

200
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,880
AND THAT'S EXACTLY HOW SHE

201
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,720
SIGNED HER NAME WHEN SHE VOTED

202
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,880
IN THE NOVEMBER 3RD GENERAL

203
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,880
ELECTION.

204
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,880
WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR?

205
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,880
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHARE THAT.

206
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,900
I VOTED FOR THE DEMOCRATS,

207
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,900
FOR BIDEN.

208
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:41,920
I SEE.

209
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:43,899
AND SO...

210
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:43,920
I GUESS I VOTED AGAINST THE

211
00:05:43,921 --> 00:05:45,880
OTHER ONE, REALLY.

212
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,880
OKAY, SO THE CLAIM WAS

213
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,880
BULLSHIT.

214
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,880
HE DIDN'T VOTE; SHE DID.

215
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,880
AND, BY THE WAY, NOT SO MUCH FOR

216
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,780
BIDEN AS AGAINST THE OTHER ONE,

217
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,880
MEANING THAT THIS 96-YEAR-OLD'S

218
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,880
APPROACH TO THE ELECTION WAS THE

219
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,880
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT OF

220
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,420
20-YEAR-OLD PROGRESSIVES.

221
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:58,918
I WONDER WHAT ELSE DO THEY HAVE

222
00:05:58,919 --> 00:05:59,880
IN COMMON?

223
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,880
DOES SHE ALSO HAVE A COLLECTION

224
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,880
OF DANK MEMES AND SPEND FIVE

225
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,880
HOURS A DAY CALLING BILL DE

226
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,880
BLASIO A BITCH ON TWITTER?

227
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,880
I REALLY HOPE SO.

228
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,880
THEN THERE WERE CLAIMS FROM

229
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,880
NUMEROUS SUPPOSED

230
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,880
WHISTLEBLOWERS.

231
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,880
IN FACT, LINDSEY GRAHAM,

232
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,880
LESLIE JORDAN'S ABSOLUTE WORST

233
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,880
CHARACTER, SENT A LETTER TO THE

234
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,880
DOJ ASKING THEM TO INVESTIGATE

235
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,880
PARTICULAR CLAIMS BY A POSTAL

236
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,880
WORKER IN ERIE, PENNSYLVANIA,

237
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,880
WHO SAID IN AN AFFIDAVIT

238
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,880
THAT POSTMARKS WERE BEING

239
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,880
BACKDATED ON MAIL-IN BALLOTS TO

240
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,880
MAKE IT APPEAR AS THOUGH THEY'D

241
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,880
BEEN COLLECTED ON ELECTION DAY.

242
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,720
UNFORTUNATELY FOR GRAHAM, THAT

243
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:30,920
MAN LATER RECANTED THOSE CLAIMS

244
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:32,880
IN THE AFFIDAVIT,

245
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,880
WHEN TALKING TO INVESTIGATORS,

246
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,880
AND WHILE HE'S NOW INSISTING HE

247
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,880
STANDS BY IT, THE REALLY

248
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,880
IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW IS, THE

249
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,880
TOTAL NUMBER OF BALLOTS FROM HIS

250
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,880
POST OFFICE THAT WERE POSTMARKED

251
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,880
NOVEMBER 3RD AND DELIVERED TO

252
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,880
THE BOARD OF ELECTIONS LATER...

253
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,880
SO, THE MAXIMUM NUMBER THAT

254
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,880
COULD HAVE HAD THEIR DATE

255
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,880
CHANGED... WAS TWO.

256
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,880
WHICH IS, AND THIS IS TRUE, NOT

257
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,880
THE NUMBER OF VOTES JOE BIDEN

258
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,880
WON PENNSYLVANIA BY.

259
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,880
BUT PERHAPS THE STRANGEST

260
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,880
WHISTLEBLOWER ACCUSATION

261
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,899
INVOLVED A POLL WORKER IN

262
00:06:59,900 --> 00:06:59,920
NEVADA, WHO FOX GAVE A PRIMETIME

263
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:02,880
SLOT TO MAKE HER CLAIMS.

264
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,880
I WENT OUT TO GO FOR A WALK

265
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,880
ON MY BREAK AND I PROBABLY HAD A

266
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,880
150-, 175-FOOT STRETCH WHERE I

267
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,880
WAS WALKING.

268
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,880
SORRY.

269
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,880
I REALLY SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED:

270
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,880
THEY DISGUISED HER IDENTITY

271
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,880
BY MAKING HER SOUND LIKE

272
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,880
MEGAN MULLALLY

273
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,880
UNDERGOING AN EXORCISM.

274
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,880
BUT I'LL LET HER CONTINUE...

275
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,880
BASICALLY, SHE CLAIMS SHE SAW A

276
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,880
BIDEN-HARRIS CAMPAIGN VAN

277
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,900
OUTSIDE THE POLLING PLACE WITH

278
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:25,920
PEOPLE HANDLING WHITE ENVELOPES.

279
00:07:25,921 --> 00:07:27,880
GO.

280
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,880
AS I GOT CLOSER, THE

281
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,880
ENVELOPES WERE BEING TORN OPEN,

282
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,880
THERE WERE TWO MEN... OR TWO

283
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,880
PEOPLE DROPPING THE ENVELOPES,

284
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,880
AND TWO PEOPLE RIPPING THEM UP

285
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,880
OPEN AND TURNING AND FACING THE

286
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,880
VAN AND DRAWING ON THEM OR

287
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,880
MARKING THEM.

288
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,880
AND AS I WALKED BY, I LOOKED AND

289
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,880
I THOUGHT, "THOSE ARE BALLOTS."

290
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,880
OKAY, I'M JUST GOING TO

291
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,880
THAT'S EITHER BULLSHIT

292
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,880
OR THE DUMBEST SCHEME OF ALL

293
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,880
TIME.

294
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,880
THE BIDEN-HARRIS CAMPAIGN OPENED

295
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,880
ENVELOPES AND MARKED BALLOTS IN

296
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,880
THE PARKING LOT OF A POLLING

297
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,880
PLACE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AGAINST

298
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,880
THE SIDE OF A VAN WHICH HAD

299
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,880
THEIR LOGO ON IT.

300
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,880
THAT IS LIKE IF, IN

301
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,880
"OCEAN'S ELEVEN," THEY SHOWED UP

302
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,880
TO THE CASINO IN A GIANT "DANNY

303
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,880
OCEAN ROBBERY SERVICE" VAN AND

304
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,880
SLOWLY PUT ON THEIR DISGUISES IN

305
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,880
THE LOBBY.

306
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,880
IT'S THE PERFECT CRIME!

307
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,880
ALSO, THAT WOMAN HASN'T YET

308
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,880
FILED A FORMAL COMPLAINT.

309
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,880
ACCORDING TO THE NEVADA A.G.'S

310
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,880
OFFICE, ALL THEY'VE RECEIVED IS

311
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,880
A REDACTED AFFIDAVIT THAT

312
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,880
DOESN'T CONTAIN HER NAME,

313
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,880
SIGNATURE, OR CONTACT

314
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,880
INFORMATION, MEANING THEY HAVE

315
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,880
NO WAY TO BEGIN A PROPER

316
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,880
INVESTIGATION.

317
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,880
AND THAT HAS BEEN SOMETHING OF A

318
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,880
THE TRUMP TEAM

319
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,880
MAKING CLAIMS OF WIDESPREAD

320
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,880
FRAUD, PUBLICLY, BUT THERE THEN

321
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,880
BEING A HUGE DROPOFF WHEN IT

322
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,880
COMES TO WHAT THEY ACTUALLY FILE

323
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,880
IN COURT.

324
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,880
IN MICHIGAN, THEY SUBMITTED A

325
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,880
LAWSUIT WITH 234 PAGES OF

326
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,880
AFFIDAVITS FROM POLL WATCHERS,

327
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,880
BUT THOSE WHO ACTUALLY READ THEM

328
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,880
FOUND THAT THEY DO NOT SHOW

329
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,880
PROOF OF WIDESPREAD FRAUD OR

330
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,880
EGREGIOUS MISCONDUCT.

331
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,880
INSTEAD, THEY'RE EITHER

332
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,880
ALLEGATIONS FROM PEOPLE WHO

333
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,880
DON'T SEEM TO FULLY UNDERSTAND

334
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,880
HOW THE VOTE-COUNTING PROCESS

335
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,880
WORKS, SO ARE QUESTIONING PRETTY

336
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,880
COMMONPLACE THINGS, OR THEY ARE

337
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,880
PETTY BULLSHIT LIKE COMPLAINING

338
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,880
PEOPLE INSIDE THE COUNTING ROOM

339
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,880
WERE WEARING "BLACK LIVES

340
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,880
MATTER" SHIRTS OR THAT ELECTION

341
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,880
WORKERS WERE OPENING BALLOTS

342
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,880
WITH DONALD TRUMP VOTES AND

343
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,880
ROLLING THEIR EYES.

344
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,880
NEITHER OF WHICH ARE ILLEGAL!

345
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,880
AND IF IT HELPS HERE, LET ME

346
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,880
JUST HEAD OFF ANY FUTURE TRUMP

347
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,880
A POLL WORKER

348
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,880
EATING A BANANA IS NOT EVIDENCE

349
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,880
OF VOTER FRAUD.

350
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,420
ONE HUMMING THE CHORUS OF

351
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,880
"UPTOWN GIRL" IS NOT EVIDENCE OF

352
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,880
VOTER FRAUD.

353
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,899
NOW, WEARING A BASEBALL CAP

354
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:14,920
COULD BE EVIDENCE OF VOTER

355
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,880
FRAUD, BUT ONLY IF THE PERSON

356
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,880
WEARING IT IS PUTTING VALID

357
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,880
VOTES INTO A PAPER SHREDDER.

358
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,880
IF IT'S JUST THE HAT PART, THAT,

359
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,880
AGAIN, IS NOT EVIDENCE OF VOTER

360
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,880
FRAUD.

361
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,880
AND LOOK, I COULD SPEND THE REST

362
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,880
OF THE SHOW DEBUNKING STORIES.

363
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,880
THE PROBLEM IS, IT'S ENDLESS.

364
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,880
THE LATEST CLAIM IS THAT VOTING

365
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,880
MACHINES OR SOFTWARE CHANGED

366
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,880
VOTES, EVEN THOUGH THIS

367
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,880
GOVERNMENT CYBERSECURITY AGENCY

368
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,880
CREATED BY AN ACT THAT TRUMP

369
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,880
HIMSELF SIGNED... RELEASED A

370
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,880
STATEMENT SAYING, "THERE IS NO

371
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,880
EVIDENCE THAT ANY VOTING SYSTEM

372
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,880
DELETED OR LOST VOTES, CHANGED

373
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,880
VOTES, OR WAS IN ANY WAY

374
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,880
COMPROMISED, " AND THAT " THE

375
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,880
NOVEMBER 3RD ELECTION WAS THE

376
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,900
MOST SECURE IN AMERICAN

377
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,440
HISTORY."

378
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,880
IN FACT, AS OF THIS TAPING, ONE

379
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,880
OF THE FEW SEEMINGLY LEGITIMATE

380
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,880
CASES AGAINST ANYONE FOR VOTER

381
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,720
FRAUD THIS YEAR HAS BEEN THIS:

382
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,880
LUZERNE COUNTY OFFICIALS SAY,

383
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,880
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 30 YEARS,

384
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,880
THERE HAS BEEN A VOTER FRAUD

385
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,880
ARREST.

386
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,880
COUNTY DETECTIVES SAY

387
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,880
ROBERT LYNN OF FORTY FORT SIGNED

388
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,880
HIS DECEASED MOTHER'S NAME ON AN

389
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,880
ABSENTEE BALLOT APPLICATION, AND

390
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,880
THAT'S A CRIME.

391
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,880
LYNN IS A REGISTERED REPUBLICAN.

392
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,880
COURT PAPERWORK SHOWS THE

393
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,880
APPLICATION WAS FLAGGED IN

394
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,880
SEPTEMBER AND ELECTIONS

395
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,880
OFFICIALS REPORTED IT TO COUNTY

396
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,880
DETECTIVES.

397
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,880
YEAH, THAT'S ONE

398
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,880
PERSON, ALLEGEDLY TRYING TO

399
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,880
STEAL ONE VOTE, THAT WAS FLAGGED

400
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,880
IN SEPTEMBER, AND THE PERSON

401
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,900
INVOLVED WAS A TRUMP SUPPORTER.

402
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,880
AND THIS IS NOT THE MOST

403
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,880
IMPORTANT THING, BUT IT HAPPENED

404
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,880
IN A TOWN CALLED FORTY FORT,

405
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,880
WHICH IS JUST DELIGHTFUL.

406
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,880
JUST SAY THE WORDS "FORTY FORT"

407
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,880
OUT LOUD, RIGHT NOW.

408
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,880
FORTY FORT.

409
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,880
IT FEELS SO GOOD IN THE MOUTH.

410
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,880
NOW, APPARENTLY THE TOWN WAS

411
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,880
NAMED AFTER THE ORIGINAL 40

412
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,880
SETTLERS WHO BUILT A FORT THERE,

413
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,880
BUT I CALL BULLSHIT, BECAUSE I

414
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,880
REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE

415
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,880
JUST HAPPENED TO BE 40 SETTLERS

416
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,880
WHO NAMED THEIR FORT

417
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,880
"FORTY FORT" WITHOUT BEING FULLY

418
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,880
AWARE OF HOW FUNNY THAT SOUNDS.

419
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,880
HERE'S WHAT I THINK HAPPENED:

420
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,880
THEY BUILT THE FORT, THEN ONE

421
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,880
SETTLER SAID, "WHAT SHOULD WE

422
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,880
CALL THIS PLACE?"

423
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,880
AND ANOTHER SAID, "WHO CARES?

424
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,880
LET'S JUST NAME IT FORTY FORT."

425
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,880
AND EVERYONE JUSTIFIABLY LAUGHED

426
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,880
VERY HARD AND AGREED TO DO JUST

427
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,880
THAT.

428
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,880
THEN ANOTHER SETTLER... WHO NO

429
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,880
ONE REALLY LIKED... SAID, "WAIT,

430
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,880
WHAT IF SOMEONE ASKS WHY WE

431
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,880
CALLED IT 'FORTY FORT'?

432
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,880
WE CAN'T JUST SAY WE DID IT

433
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,900
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IT WAS

434
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:14,918
FUNNY."

435
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:15,880
AND EVERYONE QUIETLY MUTTERED,

436
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,880
"OH, MY GOD, EZEKIEL, YOU SUCK

437
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,880
SO MUCH."

438
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,880
SO THEN THEY SAID, "OKAY, IF

439
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,880
ANYONE ASKS, WE CALLED IT FORTY

440
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,900
FORT BECAUSE THERE ARE FORTY OF

441
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,400
US.

442
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,880
I MEAN, THERE AREN'T, BUT WHO'S

443
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,880
GOING TO CALL US OUT ON THAT?

444
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,880
IT'S FUCKING 1770 AND MOST

445
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,880
PEOPLE CAN'T READ."

446
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,880
AND THAT IS HOW FORTY FORT GOT

447
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,880
ITS NAME.

448
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,880
I WILL TAKE THAT STORY TO MY

449
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,880
GRAVEY GRAVE.

450
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,880
AND FOR THE RECORD, I HAVE

451
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,880
EXACTLY AS MUCH EVIDENCE TO BACK

452
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,880
THAT UP AS REPUBLICANS CURRENTLY

453
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,880
DO OF WIDESPREAD VOTER FRAUD IN

454
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,880
THIS ELECTION.

455
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,880
SO THE ALLEGATIONS HERE ARE

456
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,880
COMPLETE NONSENSE.

457
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,899
AND WHO KNOWS WHY REPUBLICANS

458
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:48,918
ARE ENTERTAINING THIS?

459
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:49,880
MAYBE IT'S TO DO WITH THE FACT

460
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,880
GEORGIA HAS TWO SENATE RUNOFFS

461
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,880
COMING UP AND THEY WANT TO KEEP

462
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,880
TRUMP HAPPY SO HE'LL HELP RALLY

463
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,880
VOTERS FOR THEM THERE.

464
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,880
MAYBE THEY'RE CURRYING FAVOR

465
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,900
WITH HIM BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED

466
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:57,918
THAT HE'LL BE A POWER BROKER

467
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:58,880
GOING FORWARD.

468
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,880
I DON'T KNOW.

469
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,880
WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT THE

470
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,880
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION, "WHAT IS

471
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,880
THE DOWNSIDE OF HUMORING HIM?"

472
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,880
IS "A LOT," BECAUSE THIS

473
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,880
ADMINISTRATION'S REFUSAL TO

474
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,880
ACKNOWLEDGE THE ELECTION'S

475
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,880
OUTCOME MEANS THAT BIDEN IS NOT

476
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,880
GETTING HIGH-LEVEL INTELLIGENCE

477
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,880
REPORTS AND CAN'T ACCESS FUNDS

478
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,880
MEANT TO FACILITATE HIS

479
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,880
TRANSITION.

480
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,880
AND THEN, OF COURSE, THERE IS

481
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,880
THIS.

482
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,880
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ONGOING

483
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,880
REFUSAL TO CONCEDE THE RACE IS

484
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,880
COMPLICATING BIDEN'S PANDEMIC

485
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,880
PLANNING.

486
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,880
UNTIL THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

487
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,880
FORMALLY RECOGNIZES BIDEN AS

488
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,900
PRESIDENT-ELECT, OUTGOING TRUMP

489
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,880
OFFICIALS CAN'T SHARE CRITICAL

490
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,880
COVID VACCINE DISTRIBUTION PLANS

491
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,880
WITH THE INCOMING BIDEN TEAM.

492
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,880
YEAH.

493
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,880
AND THAT'S NOT GREAT.

494
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,880
WITH CASES SPIKING TO A

495
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,880
TERRIFYING EXTENT, YOU REALLY

496
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,880
WANT THE NEW TEAM HANDLING THE

497
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,880
PANDEMIC TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO

498
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,880
THE OLD TEAM... EVEN IF, AS I

499
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,880
SUSPECT, THE OLD TEAM'S PLAN WAS

500
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,880
JUST A SINGLE WHITEBOARD IN

501
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,880
JARED'S OFFICE WITH NOTHING ON

502
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,880
IT EXCEPT FOR "DISCOVER CURE?"

503
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,880
CIRCLED FIVE TIMES AND A DRAWING

504
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,880
OF DONALD TRUMP SAYING

505
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,880
"GOOD JOB, NEW SON."

506
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,880
BUT THE DAMAGE OF INDULGING

507
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,880
TRUMP GOES EVEN FURTHER, BECAUSE

508
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,880
IT ALSO PLAYS INTO THE GRIM

509
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,880
FANTASIES OF EMBATTLED TRUMP

510
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,880
SUPPORTERS, SOMETHING EXPRESSED

511
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,880
PERHAPS MOST DRAMATICALLY AND

512
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,840
STUPIDLY BY THE ACTOR JON VOIGHT

513
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,880
IN THIS VIDEO THAT TRUMP HIMSELF

514
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,880
RETWEETED ON WEDNESDAY.

515
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,880
MY FELLOW AMERICANS, I STAND

516
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,880
HERE WITH ALL THAT FEEL, AS I

517
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,880
DO, DISGUSTED WITH THIS LIE THAT

518
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,880
BIDEN HAS BEEN CHOSEN, AS IF WE

519
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,880
ALL DON'T KNOW THE TRUTH.

520
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,880
THIS IS NOW OUR GREATEST FIGHT

521
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,880
SINCE THE CIVIL WAR.

522
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,880
THE BATTLE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS

523
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,880
VERSUS SATAN.

524
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,880
YES, SATAN.

525
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,880
LET US FIGHT THIS FIGHT AS IF IT

526
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,880
IS OUR LAST FIGHT ON EARTH.

527
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,880
AS MUHAMMAD ALI SAID, IT'S NOT

528
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,880
OVER TILL THE LAST PUNCH YOU

529
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,880
HAVE.

530
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,880
OKAY, THERE'S A LOT

531
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,880
THERE, FROM DOUBLING DOWN ON

532
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,880
CALLING THE LEFT SATAN TO SAYING

533
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,880
"I STAND HERE" WHEN HE'S CLEARLY

534
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,880
SITTING, TO THAT MUHAMMAD ALI

535
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,880
QUOTE, WHICH WE COULD NOT FIND

536
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,880
ANY RECORD OF HIM SAYING.

537
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,880
WHICH DOES MAKE SENSE, BECAUSE

538
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,880
IT DOESN'T REALLY SOUND LIKE

539
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,880
MUHAMMAD ALI.

540
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,880
IT DOESN'T HAVE THE RHETORICAL

541
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,880
FLAIR OF "FLOAT LIKE A

542
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,880
BUTTERFLY, STING LIKE A BEE," OR

543
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,880
THE WIT OF "I'M SO MEAN, I MAKE

544
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,880
MEDICINE SICK."

545
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,880
"IT'S NOT OVER TILL THE LAST

546
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,880
PUNCH YOU HAVE" SOUNDS LESS LIKE

547
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,880
MUHAMMAD ALI AND MORE LIKE A

548
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,880
BLURB ON A BOOTLEG VHS COVER OF

549
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,880
"ROCKY IV."

550
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,880
AND SURE, THAT'S A RIDICULOUS

551
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,880
VIDEO, BUT THE FACT IS, A LOT OF

552
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,900
PEOPLE BELIEVE STUFF LIKE THAT.

553
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,880
AND WHEN YOU CONTINUALLY INSIST

554
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,880
THAT THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN IN

555
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,880
BIG CITIES AND SUGGEST THAT

556
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,880
REMEDYING THIS CALLS FOR THE

557
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,880
BIGGEST FIGHT SINCE THE CIVIL

558
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,880
WAR, THINGS START TO GET

559
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,880
DEADLY SERIOUS.

560
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,880
LAST THURSDAY, TWO ARMED MEN

561
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,880
WERE ARRESTED OUTSIDE A

562
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,880
PHILADELPHIA CONVENTION CENTER

563
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,880
AFTER POLICE HAD RECEIVED A TIP

564
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,900
ABOUT A THREAT TO THE

565
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,860
VOTE-COUNTING SITE.

566
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,880
AND ONE OF THE CITY

567
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,880
COMMISSIONERS IN CHARGE OF

568
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,880
BALLOT COUNTING... A REPUBLICAN,

569
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,880
BY THE WAY... HAS BEEN

570
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,880
UNDERSTANDABLY RATTLED BY THE

571
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,540
CHAOS ENGULFING HIS OFFICE.

572
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,880
FROM THE INSIDE LOOKING OUT,

573
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,880
IT FEELS ALL VERY DERANGED.

574
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,880
IT'S PEOPLE MAKING ACCUSATIONS,

575
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,880
THAT WE WOULDN'T COUNT THOSE

576
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,880
VOTES, OR ADDING FRAUDULENT

577
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,880
VOTES OR JUST COMING UP WITH ALL

578
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,880
SORTS OF CRAZY STUFF.

579
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,880
ACCUSATIONS LIKE "YOU ARE

580
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,900
CHEATING."

581
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,400
YES.

582
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,900
"YOU ARE MANIPULATING THE

583
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:17,920
VOTE."

584
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:19,880
YES.

585
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,880
OR CALLS TO OUR OFFICES

586
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,880
REMINDING US THAT THIS IS WHAT

587
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,880
THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS FOR,

588
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,880
PEOPLE LIKE US.

589
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,899
YOU'RE GETTING CALLS LIKE

590
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:31,918
THAT?

591
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:32,880
YES.

592
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,880
THAT'S A NOT-SO-VEILED DEATH

593
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,880
THREAT.

594
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,880
YES, FOR COUNTING VOTES IN A

595
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,880
DEMOCRACY.

596
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,880
THAT'S AWFUL.

597
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,899
AND TRUMP IS PLAYING A DANGEROUS

598
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:45,920
GAME HERE, BECAUSE THERE IS A

599
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:47,880
HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

600
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,880
"NOT MY PRESIDENT" AND

601
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,880
"NOT THE PRESIDENT."

602
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,880
AND TO BE CLEAR, PEOPLE WHO ARE

603
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,880
THAT ANGRY ARE NOT RILING

604
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,880
THEMSELVES UP IN A VACUUM.

605
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,880
THEY'VE BEEN FED A STEADY DIET

606
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,880
OF MISINFORMATION, BULLSHIT

607
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,880
FRAUD CLAIMS, AND A VICTIM

608
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,880
NARRATIVE FROM OUTLETS LIKE

609
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,880
FOX NEWS, NEWSMAX, OAN, AND MOST

610
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,880
IMPORTANTLY, TRUMP HIMSELF,

611
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,880
WHOSE TWITTER FEED THIS WEEK

612
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,880
OSCILLATED BETWEEN BREITBART

613
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,880
ARTICLES, NONSENSE CLAIMS THAT

614
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,880
HE WON PENNSYLVANIA, AND ONE

615
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,880
LONE REPLY TO SCOTT BAIO, WHO

616
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,900
YOU MAY KNOW FROM "HAPPY DAYS"

617
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,880
BABY

618
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,880
GENIUSES 2," WHERE HE STARRED

619
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,880
ALONGSIDE NONE OTHER THAN

620
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,880
JON VOIGHT.

621
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,880
I BET THEY HAD A LOT OF FUN ON

622
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,880
SET, BECAUSE I GUARANTEE NO ONE

623
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,900
ELSE DID.

624
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,880
AND INFURIATINGLY, TRUMP HAS

625
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,880
CHOSEN TO SOW ALL THIS CHAOS

626
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,880
AROUND THE ELECTION DESPITE THE

627
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,880
FACT THAT, DEEP DOWN, HE KNOWS

628
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,880
IT'S OVER.

629
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,880
FRIDAY AFTERNOON, THE FINAL

630
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,880
STATES WERE CALLED BY MOST

631
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,880
OUTLETS, PUTTING JOE BIDEN AT

632
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,880
306 ELECTORAL VOTES TO

633
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,880
TRUMP'S 232.

634
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,880
AND DURING A PRESS CONFERENCE

635
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,880
TRUMP HELD A FEW HOURS LATER, HE

636
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,880
NEARLY ACKNOWLEDGED REALITY.

637
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,880
IDEALLY, WE WON'T GO TO A

638
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,880
LOCKDOWN.

639
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,880
I WILL NOT GO... THIS

640
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,880
ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT BE GOING

641
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,880
TO A LOCKDOWN.

642
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,880
HOPEFULLY THE... THE, UH,

643
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,900
WHATEVER HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE

644
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:58,918
WHO KNOWS WHICH

645
00:16:58,919 --> 00:16:59,880
ADMINISTRATION IT WILL BE?

646
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,880
I GUESS TIME WILL TELL.

647
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,900
BUT I CAN TELL YOU, THIS

648
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:02,920
ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT GO TO A

649
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,880
LOCKDOWN.

650
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,880
EXCEPT NO, TIME WILL

651
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,880
NOT TELL.

652
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,880
TIME HAS TOLD.

653
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,880
TRUMP LOST THIS ELECTION, AND HE

654
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,880
KNOWS IT.

655
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,880
AND YET, JUST AN HOUR AFTER THAT

656
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,880
PRESS CONFERENCE, HE WAS

657
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,880
RETWEETING VOTER FRAUD

658
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,880
CONSPIRACIES AGAIN, WHICH IS

659
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,880
PATHETIC, DANGEROUS, AND IN MANY

660
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,880
WAYS, AN APPROPRIATE CODA TO A

661
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,880
PRESIDENCY THAT HAS DESTROYED SO

662
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,880
MANY LIVES... NOT ONLY OF THOSE

663
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,880
THAT HE'S ATTACKED, BUT ALSO OF

664
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,880
THOSE HE'S CLAIMED TO PROTECT.

665
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,880
SO MANY OF US HAVE LOST LOVED

666
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,880
ONES, EITHER BECAUSE YOU COULD

667
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,880
NO LONGER SQUARE YOUR LOVE FOR

668
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,880
THEM WITH THEIR LOVE FOR HIM OR

669
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,880
BECAUSE THEY FELL DOWN A

670
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,880
MIND-MELTING RABBIT HOLE OF

671
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,880
CONSPIRACY THEORIES THAT HE

672
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,880
HAPPILY PERPETUATED OR BECAUSE

673
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,720
HE LET A DEADLY VIRUS RUN WILD

674
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,880
AND IT FUCKING KILLED THEM!

675
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,880
AND NOW, AS A PARTING GIFT TO

676
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,880
THE COUNTRY, TRUMP IS SOMEHOW

677
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,880
MANAGING TO DIVIDE US EVEN

678
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,780
FURTHER WHILE ALSO HOBBLING HIS

679
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,880
SUCCESSOR AT THE WORST POSSIBLE

680
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,880
TIME, WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY

681
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,880
UNFORGIVABLE.

682
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,880
AND YES, THE FACT TRUMP WON'T BE

683
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,880
PRESIDENT NEXT YEAR IS GOOD.

684
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,899
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

685
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,860
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO,

686
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,880
AND AT LEAST IN THE SHORT-TERM,

687
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,900
THINGS ARE GOING TO SUCK FOR A

688
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:03,920
WHILE.

689
00:18:03,921 --> 00:18:05,660
BUT WE HAVE TO TRY AND REPAIR

690
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,880
THIS DAMAGE.

691
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,880
AS A GREAT FIGHTER ONCE SAID,

692
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,880
"IT'S NOT OVER TILL THE FINAL

693
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,000
FISTING YOU GIVE."

694
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:15,400
AND NOW THIS.

695
00:18:15,401 --> 00:18:16,900
OR SOME SHIT LIKE THAT.

696
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,900
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYMORE.

697
00:18:18,921 --> 00:18:23,899
AND NOW...

698
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:23,920
2020 BINGO.

699
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:26,899
THE BINGO BOARD FOR 2020 IS

700
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:26,920
LARGE.

701
00:18:26,921 --> 00:18:28,880
IT'S LIKE... YOU KNOW, IT FOLDS

702
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,880
OUT MANY TIMES.

703
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,899
IT IS LARGER THAN ANY GAME BOARD

704
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:31,920
IN YOUR HOUSE.

705
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:34,880

00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,880

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

CLEARLY, THIS HAS BEEN A DARK

736
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,880
TIME TO BE PRODUCING A COMEDY

737
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,880
SHOW, BUT INCREDIBLY, WE'VE

738
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,880
MANAGED TO HAVE SOME FUN.

00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,880
WE SPONSORED A MARBLE LEAGUE, WE

740
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,880
MADE STAMPS TO HELP THE POSTAL

00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,880
SERVICE, WE TURNED DOWN THIS

742
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,880
MAGNIFICENT PIECE OF WRAPPED

743
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,880
EROTICA, AND WENDY WILLIAMS

744
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,880
EATING A PORK CHOP.

745
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,880
WE MADE A SHOW FOR CATS, I GOT

746
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,880
IN A FIGHT WITH DANBURY,

747
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,880
CONNECTICUT, JOHN CENA DELIVERED

748
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,880
A MESSAGE ABOUT CONSPIRACY

749
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,880
THEORIES FOR US WHILE TAKING UP

750
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,880
HIS SHIRT, SOMETHING... I CANNOT

751
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,880
STRESS THIS ENOUGH... WE DID NOT

752
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,880
ASK THEM TO DO.

753
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,880
THE FACT THAT HE DID THAT

754
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,880
UNPROMPTED MAKES IT EVEN

755
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,880
FUNNIER.

756
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,880
AND OF COURSE, I SPENT THE WHOLE

757
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,880
YEAR DEMANDING THAT ADAM DRIVER

758
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,880
DEMOLISHED ME, CRUSH MY

759
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,880
LEATHERNECKS, YOU UNWIELDY

760
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,880
BOULDER.

761
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,900
EXPLODE MY... OH, FUCK.

762
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:13,918
OH, SHIT.

763
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:14,919
HEY, JOHN.

764
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:15,918
WOW.

765
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:16,880
ADAM DRIVER.

766
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,899
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ARE CALLING.

767
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:18,920
LISTEN TO ME.

768
00:20:18,921 --> 00:20:21,880
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?

769
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,880
EXCUSE ME?

770
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,880
THIS BIT, THIS THING YET THAT

771
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,880
YOU ARE DOING THAT IS EITHER

772
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,880
SEXUAL OR VIOLENCE.

773
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,880
THE STRANGE, STRANGE BUT THAT

774
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,899
FOR SOME REASON YOU PULLED ME I.

775
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:33,920
WHAT IS IT?

776
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:35,900
WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED DOING IT,

777
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,899
IT WAS EASY FOR ME TO START IT

778
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:38,920
OFF.

779
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:40,720
ESPECIALLY WITH THOSE

780
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:40,920
SHOULDERS, I BET.

781
00:20:40,921 --> 00:20:42,880
THEN IT KEPT GOING ON AND

782
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,880
ON...

783
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,880
YOU COULD STROKE THE

784
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,899
WHOLE PLANET...

785
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:46,920
STOPPED TALKING.

786
00:20:46,921 --> 00:20:48,880
DO YOU REALIZE COME OVER THIS

787
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,880
PAST YEAR, WHAT YOU'VE ASKED ME

788
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,880
TO DO TO YOU?

789
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,880
COLLAPSE ON YOUR CHEST.

790
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,900
TELL YOUR FINGERS IN A SQUARE

791
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:54,920
KNOT.

792
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,880
STEP ON YOUR THROAT.

793
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,880
SHATTER YOUR KNEES.

794
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,880
PULL YOUR HEART OUT THROUGH YOUR

795
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,880
EAR.

796
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,880
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

797
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,899
YOU REALIZE WE ARE STRANGERS,

798
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:04,918
RIGHT?

799
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:05,880
I DON'T KNOW YOU.

800
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,880
NOT RANDOM PEOPLE ON THE

801
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,880
INTERNET STAN US, CLAIMING THAT

802
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,880
YOU THIRSTING OVER ME IS A MOOD.

803
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,880
A GET IT.

804
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,880
I'M SICK OF PEOPLE STOPPING

805
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,880
ME ON THE STREET AND ASKING IF I

806
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,880
WILL PUNCH A HOLE THROUGH YOU

807
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,899
LIKE A "MARRIAGE STORY" WALL.

808
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:22,920
THAT'S FAIR.

809
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:24,880
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF

810
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,880
YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU KNEW IT WAS

811
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,880
INAPPROPRIATE.

812
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,880
FROM THE MOMENT, YOU WERE JUST

813
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,880
LIKE...

814
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,480
I WAS HAVING SOME

815
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:30,918
WEIRD FUN.

816
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:31,880
EXACTLY.

817
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,900
NOW YOU ARE WHAT?

818
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,880
I'M AMERICA'S

819
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,880
NAUGHTIEST BITCH.

820
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,899
SURE, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY

821
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:39,920
YOU ARE...

822
00:21:39,921 --> 00:21:45,899
I AM 6 FEET OF NASTY

823
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:45,918
"LAST WEEK TONIGHT" BIRD MEAT?

824
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:46,880
SORRY.

825
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,880
I'M TRYING TO GET YOU

826
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,880
TO SAY SORRY.

827
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,880
I'M SORRY, I AM

828
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,880
TRULY, TRULY SORRY, CONSIDER

829
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,880
THIS BIT OVER.

830
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,880
IT IS DONE.

831
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,880
OKAY.

832
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,880
IT'S FINE.

833
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,880
LOOK, IT'S BEEN A ROUGH YEAR FOR

834
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,899
EVERYONE, AND I CAN TELL, IT'S

835
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:04,920
REALLY GOTTEN TO YOU.

836
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:08,880
SITTING ALONE IN YOUR VOID.

837
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,880
BUT I THINK MAYBE, IT MIGHT BE

838
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,880
TIME FOR YOU TO STEP OUT OF IT

839
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,880
FOR A BIT.

840
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,880
GET UP FROM YOUR CHAIR.

841
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,880
SEE WHAT THE WORLD HAS TO OFFER.

842
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,880
EXPLORE THE SPACE, MAN.

843
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,880
WHO KNOWS?

844
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,880
MAYBE YOU'LL EVEN EVEN DISCOVER

845
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,880
SOME SURPRISES ALONG THE WAY.

846
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,880
HUH, ALL RIGHT, I

847
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,880
THINK I MIGHT PRAY JUST TO BE

848
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,880
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR, THOUGH, ADAM,

849
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,880
ARE YOU GIVING ME

850
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,880
AN ORDER?

851
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,880
SURE.

852
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,880
JUST... IT DIDN'T

853
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,880
SOUND LIKE AN ORDER.

854
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,880
EXPLORE THE FUCKING SPACE,

855
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,880
YOU WILL FOLLOW BONE TO MR. B

856
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,880
AND COSPLAYER.

857
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,899
LOOK AROUND YOU, YOU UN UNDER BD

858
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,860
GINGERBREAD BOY.

859
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,899
OH, GOD, THAT FEELS

860
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:54,918
GOOD.

861
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:55,880
I HATED THIS.

862
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,880
GOODBYE.

863
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,880
I MEAN, THAT WENT

864
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,880
REALLY WELL.

865
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,880
YOU KNOW WHAT, ADAM DRIVER IS

866
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,880
RIGHT AND HOT AND MASSIVE, BUT

867
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,880
HE'S MAINLY RIGHT.

868
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,880
BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN STUCK IN

869
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,880
THIS EMPTY VOID SINCE MARCH AND

870
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,880
I'M REALIZING, I HAVEN'T SHOWN

871
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,880
YOU ANY OF IT.

872
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,900
IT'S ACTUALLY MUCH BIGGER THAN

873
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:10,918
JUST THIS.

874
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:11,880
COME WITH ME.

875
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,880
I'LL GIVE YOU A TOUR.

876
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,880
AS YOU CAN SEE, JUST OFF CAMERA,

877
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,880
THERE IS MORE VOID AND A BIT

878
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,880
MORE, AND THEN A BIT MORE AFTER

879
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,880
THAT.

880
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,880
IT IS A TRULY ENORMOUS,

881
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,880
EXPANSIVE NOTHING.

882
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,880
AND THIS IS WHERE I HAVE BEEN

883
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,880
ALL YEAR LONG!

884
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,880
NOW INTERESTINGLY, THIS BOY DOES

885
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,880
NOT CONFORM TO NORMAL RULES OF

886
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,880
PHYSICS.

887
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,880
FOR EXAMPLE, THE DESK I'VE BEEN

888
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,880
SITTING BEHIND THIS WHOLE TIME,

889
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,899
IT'S UP THERE.

890
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,880
WEIRD, RIGHT?

891
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,880
BUT I HAVE TO SAY, ALL OF THIS

892
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,880
DOES MAKE ME A LITTLE SAD,

893
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,880
BECAUSE WE USED TO HAVE AN

894
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,880
AUDIENCE FOR THIS SHOW.

895
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,880
ALSO, I USED TO GET TO SEE THE

896
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,880
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE I MAKE THIS

897
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,880
SHOW WITH, MOST OF WHOM I MISS

898
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,880
VERY MUCH.

899
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,880
AND THREE OF WHOM I DON'T.

900
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,880
TWO OF YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

901
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,880
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE USE TO

902
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,880
END OUR SEASONS WITH BIG STUNTS,

903
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,880
JUST FOUR YEARS AGO, I BLEW UP

904
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,880
THE YEAR 2016, AS IF THAT WAS A

905
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,880
VERY BAD YEAR, AND IT WAS.

906
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,880
IT WAS TERRIBLE.

907
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,880
BUT THIS YEAR?

908
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,880
HOLY SHIT.

909
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,880
THIS HAS BEEN A LOT.

910
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,880
FOR ME, IT DOES NOT LIKE THE

911
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,880
WORLD HAS SOMEHOW BOTH SHRUNK A.

912
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,880
I DON'T SEE ANYONE, I DON'T DO

913
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,880
ANYTHING, AND I HAVE NO IDEA

914
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,040
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT.

915
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,880
SPEEFIFTEEN.

916
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,899
HUH.

917
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:45,920
A DOOR.

918
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:50,880
THAT'S NEW.

919
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,880
WOW.

920
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,880
THIS MIGHT BE THE LAST TIME I

921
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,880
SEE THIS BLANK VOID.

922
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,880
WELL, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING!

923
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,880
YOU WERE REALLY GREAT AT BEING

924
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,880
WHITE, DEPRESSING, AND

925
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,880
REMARKABLE EMPTY ON THE INSIDE!

926
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,880
AND THAT IS GAME RECOGNIZING

927
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,880
GAME!

928
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,880
OKAY.

929
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,880
LET'S SEE WHAT'S ON THE OTHER

930
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,920
SIDE.

931
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:36,920
OH.

932
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:39,880
THAT MAKES SENSE.

933
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,880
LOOK, THIS YEAR HAS BEEN AN

934
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,880
ABSOLUTE PARADE OF MISERY.

935
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,880
IN JANUARY ALONE, AUSTRALIA HAS

936
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,880
BEEN RAVAGED BY WILDFIRES,

937
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,880
KOBE BRYANT DIED, AND FOR A FEW

938
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,880
DAYS, IT REALLY SEEMED LIKE

939
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,880
AMERICA WAS ABOUT TO GO TO WAR

940
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,880
WITH IRAN.

941
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,880
THAT WAS ALL THIS YEAR.

942
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,899
AND THAT WAS BEFORE THE

943
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:57,920
CORONAVIRUS EXPLODED AND

944
00:25:57,921 --> 00:26:00,880
EVERYTHING GOT EVEN WORSE.

945
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,880
MASS UNEMPLOYMENT, EVICTIONS,

946
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,880
THAT VIDEO OF THOSE CELEBRITIES

947
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,880
SINGING "IMAGINE."

948
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,880
IT WAS REALLY TERRIBLE.

949
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,880
ON TOP OF WHICH, THIS YEAR, SO

950
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,880
THE DEATHS OF CHADWICK BOSEMAN,

951
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,880
JOHN LEWIS, AND RUTH

952
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,880
BADER GINSBURG.

953
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,899
PLUS, THE CONFIRMATION OF AMY

954
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:16,920
CONEY BARRETT.

955
00:26:16,921 --> 00:26:21,880
I MEAN, FOR FUCK'S SAKE, 2020

956
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,880
MADE ME LEARN WHO CAROLE BASKIN

957
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,880
IS, IT MADE ME SET UP A GOOGLE

958
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,880
ALERT TO SEE IF SHE WAS EVER

959
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,880
CONVICTED FOR THAT THING THAT WE

960
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,880
ARE ALL PRETTY SURE SHE DID.

961
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,900
THIS YEAR RUINED LIVES, JOBS,

962
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:34,920
CONCERTS, AND SANITY.

963
00:26:34,921 --> 00:26:37,880
IT BROUGHT A NEW WAVE OF RENTING

964
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,880
VIDEOS OF POLICE BRUTALITY THAT

965
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,880
BROUGHT ON A NATIONAL RECKONING

966
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,880
WITH RACE AND A FEROCIOUS AND

967
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,880
DEPRESSING BACKLASH, AND SURE,

968
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,880
THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION ENDED

969
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,880
WELL, BUT IT WAS GRIM TO LIVE

970
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,880
THROUGH.

971
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,880
AND TRUMP WILL NOT LEAVE OFFICE

972
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,880
UNTIL NEXT JANUARY.

973
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,880
2020 WAS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.

974
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,880
AND I REALLY HOPE NEXT YEAR IS

975
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,880
GOING TO BE BETTER, BUT THE

976
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,900
TRUTH IS, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS

977
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,880
UP TO ALL OF US.

978
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,880
IT'S GOING TO DEPEND HOW WILLING

979
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,880
WE ARE TO FIGHT, HOW WELL WE

980
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,880
LEARN FROM WHAT'S HAPPENED, AND

981
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,880
HOW MUCH WE ARE ABLE TO CARE

982
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,880
ABOUT EACH OTHER.

983
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,899
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS

984
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:12,920
NEXT.

985
00:27:12,921 --> 00:27:15,900
BUT I DO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NOW.

986
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,880
LET TOMORROW BE ABOUT SOLUTIONS.

987
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,880
TODAY IS ABOUT VENGEANCE.

988
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
FUCK U, 2020.

989
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:03,900
GET FUCKED.

990
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:05,920
THAT'S IT.

991
00:29:05,921 --> 00:29:07,880
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

992
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,880
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING

993
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,880
THIS YEAR.

994
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,880
WE'LL BE BACK NEXT FEBRUARY.

995
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,880
PLEASE STAY SAFE UNTIL THEN.

996
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,900
GOOD NIGHT.
