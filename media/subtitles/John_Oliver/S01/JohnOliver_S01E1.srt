00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,600
*

2
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:27,333
[Cheers and applause]

3
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:35,300
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

4
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,800
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for being with us.

5
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:40,300
Just time for a quick recap
of the week.

6
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,800
On Friday, you may have felt
a whiff of nostalgia in the air,

7
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,800
and I'm not talking
about Ninja Turtles.

8
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:49,567
I'm talking about this.

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,733
Good morning. The U.S. military
is back in Iraq.

10
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:55,233
CHRISTI PAUL: Take a look
at these images from
the U.S. military.

11
00:00:55,267 --> 00:00:59,567
SA18 fighter jets closing in
on an ISIS artillery unit

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,300
and then here it comes,
that massive explosion.

13
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,633
Yes, America is
bombing Iraq yet again,

14
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:09,967
and the world is experiencing
a little déjà boom.

15
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:11,300
[Laughter]

16
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,800
This time, though,
it is strictly

17
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,800
for humanitarian reasons,

18
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,967
to prevent the genocide
of the Yazidi people.

19
00:01:17,067 --> 00:01:18,967
And when he announced
the airstrikes,

20
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:21,633
the President was anxious
to make two things clear:

21
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:24,133
one--how this was
the right thing to do;

22
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,100
and two--how little
he wanted to do it.

23
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:30,100
I know that many of you
are rightly concerned

24
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:33,100
about any American
military action in Iraq,

25
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:35,600
even limited strikes like these.

26
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:36,967
I understand that.

27
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:40,933
American combat troops will not
be returning to fight in Iraq.

28
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:43,767
I've got to say,
the President sounds
a lot like a girl

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,933
who is trying to reassure
her friends that she's
not getting back together

30
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:50,433
with the ex-boyfriend
that they all hate.

31
00:01:50,467 --> 00:01:54,433
"Look, guys, look, guys,
I'm just getting a drink
with Iraq, OK?

32
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:56,433
"He's having a really
tough time right now.

33
00:01:56,467 --> 00:02:00,067
"I will not be returning
back to his place,
although--you know what?

34
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:03,500
"Text me at 10:00 tonight
and remind me that he was
a nightmare.

35
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:06,500
Remind me of that.
That's good for me to hear."

36
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:09,833
In fact, there was
really only one theme

37
00:02:09,867 --> 00:02:12,933
that most people took away
from the speech.

38
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,433
A very reluctant
President Obama gave the order

39
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:17,300
for airstrikes
in Iraq last night.

40
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,867
President Obama has been
reluctant, to say the least.

41
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,767
He was reluctant to get in
and take action here.

42
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,767
CHUCK TODD: He seemed
very reluctant to do this,

43
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,700
extremely reluctant.

44
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:28,867
Oh, yes, reluctance.

45
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,533
It's always been the best tone
for leaders to use

46
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,767
when inspiring troops
before battle.

47
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,933
[Laughter]

48
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:37,600
Who can forget Henry V's
immortal words?

49
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:39,933
"Once more into the breach,
dear friends,

50
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:42,267
"unfortunately because,
uh, obviously

51
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,767
"everyone would prefer
not to go into the breach.

52
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,100
"No, even by breach standards,
this breach is ghastly.

53
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:52,267
"Look, look, we all
hate breaches, but we're
going into this one.

54
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,500
"We don't have to like it,
we just have to get
this shit over with.

55
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:58,167
"Who's with me?
Charge! Charge!

56
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,233
Charge, I say! Charge, I say!"

57
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:03,400
[Cheers and applause]

58
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,533
Turning now, though, to
an even more lawless territory

59
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:09,067
than Iraq--the Internet.

60
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:11,367
There was news this week
that may affect

61
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,067
a huge number
of people on Earth.

62
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,733
A report this morning
claims a Russian gang

63
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:20,700
is holding a massive list
of stolen online records.

64
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,200
WOMAN: According to a Milwaukee
company called Hold Security,

65
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:28,367
the thieves stole 1.2 billion
usernames and passwords.

66
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,700
OK, OK, that is
clearly worrying,

67
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:33,067
but on the bright side,
that is also

68
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:35,967
the least threatening
Russian gang ever.

69
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:37,967
[Russian accent]
"Give us what we want,

70
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:42,467
"or Dmitri here will poke
your ex-girlfriend on Fassbook.

71
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,467
He will do it."

72
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,300
The truly terrifying part
of this story

73
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,467
is not just the scale
of this theft,

74
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,267
it's what the solution
might have to be.

75
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,600
MAN: Assume that every
password that you've got
is no longer safe,

76
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:56,267
and you should go through
and change them all.

77
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,633
CHARLIE ROSE:
Just to underline that,
everybody should go

78
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:00,700
and change their passwords.

79
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:02,467
Yeah, I get that.

80
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,133
I get that I should
definitely change my password.

81
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:07,633
The problem is,
I'm not gonna do that...

82
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:09,133
[Laughter]

83
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:12,633
because that sounds hard,
even though it isn't.

84
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:16,633
At the very least,
it might involve me
having to remember answers

85
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:19,300
to security questions
from 12 years ago.

86
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,133
"What was my pet's name in 2002?

87
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:25,300
"Was it Kelly Barkson
or Hootie the Goldfish?

88
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,967
"Yeah. Oh, you know what?
It was Christina Aguilizard,

89
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,300
but I'm still not doing it.
I'm still not doing it."

90
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,967
Look, I get no one wants
to do this, so to help you,

91
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:36,800
we've actually come up
with a list of replacement words

92
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:40,133
that nobody, not even
a Russian gang,

93
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:41,633
will be able to guess.

94
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:45,133
Perfect passwords,
such as AlanAldaNewBatman.

95
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:48,133
No one is guessing that.
It's the perfect password.

96
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:52,133
That sequence of words has
never been inside anyone's head,

97
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,467
although now, to be honest, I
think he would be a good Batman.

98
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,133
I think it's a different way
to go with the character.

99
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:03,200
So instead, you might want
to go with something like
PittsburghOlympics2024.

100
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:06,067
That's rock-solid.
It makes no sense.

101
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:08,200
It even feels weird
saying it out loud.

102
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:11,867
Here's a bunch more passwords
running along the bottom
of your screen right now.

103
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,867
Help yourself to any of these.
None of them make sense.

104
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,867
There's lobsterbrownie,

105
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,867
JohnOliver=ChristianGrey,

106
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,867
just words that don't
belong together.

107
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,200
The point is you're covered.

108
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:25,700
But finally, turning
to the crisis in Gaza,

109
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:28,367
earlier this week,
everyone placed their hope

110
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,367
in the announcement of
a 72-hour cease-fire.

111
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,533
Good news?
The cease-fire held.

112
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,300
Bad news?
Then this happened.

113
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:40,300
The 3-day cease-fire between
Israel and Hamas is history.

114
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:43,300
The Israeli military says
rockets were fired into Israel

115
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,833
before the cease-fire
even ended.

116
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:49,833
Look, is it too much to ask
that the cease-fire in Gaza

117
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:52,833
last a little longer
than fucking Bonnaroo?

118
00:05:52,867 --> 00:05:54,500
[Laughter]

119
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:56,500
As of taping right now,

120
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:58,500
another cease-fire
has apparently begun.

121
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:00,567
We can all only hope
that it holds.

122
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,567
The problem is that even
when leaders over there
start to sound hopeful,

123
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,900
the things they're hopeful about
are depressingly unambitious.

124
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:11,233
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU:
There are opportunities now to

125
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:13,733
be able to fashion
a new reality,

126
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:15,900
one more conducive to
the end of violence,

127
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:19,067
to the establishment
of calm, sustainable peace,

128
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,733
or at least
a sustainable quiet.

129
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:24,233
What? Did you see that?

130
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:27,067
He wished for peace and then
immediately bargained himself

131
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,867
back to "a sustainable quiet,"
which basically sounds

132
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,200
like a librarian walking around
the region shushing everyone.

133
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:37,067
"Shh! No rockets!
Shh! Shh!"

134
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:38,267
[Laughter]

135
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,267
And if that weren't enough
to dispel any illusions

136
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,800
of imminent peace in the region,
there was also this.

137
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,800
WOMAN: A new app.
It's called "Bomb Gaza."

138
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,967
It allows users
to kill civilians

139
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:52,067
from the skies on your phone.

140
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,433
It's a game.

141
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:56,933
That's what I always thought
the problem with Gaza was--

142
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:59,433
no one had turned it
into a game yet.

143
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:02,667
It just wasn't fun until now.

144
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,167
Incredibly, there are
games out there representing
both sides of this conflict.

145
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,167
On Rocket Pride, you can
fire rockets at Israel,

146
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,333
and on Gaza Assault Code Red,

147
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:16,100
you can pilot a drone and fire
on Palestinian towns.

148
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:17,767
Just think about that.

149
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,100
Someone could have been
playing these games on
their commute to work,

150
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:24,933
while real rockets
were being fired, going,
"Oh, shit, I missed my stop.

151
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:28,267
This is the worst thing that's
happened to anyone today!"

152
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,767
[Laughter]

153
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,100
To be honest, war has always
been popular in video games.

154
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:36,600
The nuances
of diplomacy, however,

155
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:38,933
they've never held quite
the same appeal.

156
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:42,400
That is, until now.

157
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:45,233
ANNOUNCER: You've fought
terrorists in "Call of Duty"

158
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:48,233
and alien hordes
in "Gears of War."

159
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:51,900
Well, now get ready for
the opposite of that.

160
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:55,900
MAN: OK, first up on the agenda,
Paragraph 3, Subsection 4--

161
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,733
"Retention of Previously
Agreed-Upon Language."

162
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:01,800
ANNOUNCER:
"World of Peacecraft."

163
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,967
Critics are already calling it
"Uncomfortably boring"

164
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,967
and "Off-puttingly complicated."

165
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:10,467
"World of Peacecraft" features
all the heart-pounding
excitement

166
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,300
of trilateral talks
in a variety of
international settings,

167
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:18,300
from Russian conference rooms
to Pakistani conference rooms

168
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,433
to Israeli conference rooms

169
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,967
and back to Russian
conference rooms.

170
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:25,433
Are you ready
for non-stop sitting,

171
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:28,600
incessant talking,
and incremental progress,

172
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,100
all while trying to escape
the creeping sense

173
00:08:31,133 --> 00:08:34,267
that your presence may be doing
more harm than good?

174
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,267
IGN says,
"Jesus, this is bleak,"

175
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:42,933
and "Official XBOX Magazine"
raves, "I honestly would
prefer war to this."

176
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:47,467
Madeleine Albright says,
"Yeah, that's pretty much
what it's like."

177
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,967
[Cheers and applause]

178
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:53,167
ANNOUNCER:
"World of Peacecraft"...

179
00:08:58,167 --> 00:08:59,633
Moving on, moving on.

180
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:01,700
For our main story tonight,

181
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:05,067
we're going to look
at one of America's most
resilient industries--

182
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:06,533
payday loans.

183
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:09,867
One in 20 households have
taken one out at some point.

184
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,200
It's a $9 billion industry,

185
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:15,800
and payday loan outlets
are all over the place.

186
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,633
MAN: There are more
payday loan stores

187
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,800
in America than Starbucks

188
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,800
and McDonald's.

189
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,800
More than Starbucks
or McDonald's.

190
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,800
McDonald's!

191
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,967
I didn't know there was more
of anything in the U.S.
than McDonald's,

192
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:32,633
including people
and grains of sand.

193
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:34,133
[Laughter]

194
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:36,633
And the payday loan industry
has only been around

195
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,967
for just over 20 years.

196
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:41,800
Even Ebola looks at
that growth rate and thinks,

197
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,300
"That's impressive.
You guys spread fast."

198
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,800
[Laughter]

199
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,967
And it's not just the number
of companies, it's the variety.

200
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:52,967
You've got Fastcash,
Cashcentral, Speedy Cash,

201
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:55,967
Quik Cash with the word
"quick" spelled wrong,

202
00:09:56,067 --> 00:10:00,133
and Kwik Kash, with both "quick"
and "cash" spelled wrong,

203
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,800
'cause what could be more
reassuring than a business

204
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,300
that can't correctly spell
either their product

205
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,467
or the speed at which they're
getting it to you?

206
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,967
There are so many different
options that there are even
services to help match you

207
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,067
to a lender, and you cannot
have avoided these ads.

208
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,133
Hi. Montel here.
I'm Montel Williams.

209
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:21,067
Hi, I'm Montel Williams
for Money Mutual.

210
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,867
Call or go to Moneymutual.com.

211
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,033
Get up to a thousand dollars
in your checking account
by tomorrow.

212
00:10:26,067 --> 00:10:27,867
That car repair bill? Paid.

213
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,700
The medical emergency? Handled.

214
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:32,133
Extra cash
until payday? Done.

215
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:33,300
"Done."

216
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,467
[Laughter]

217
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,467
Thanks, Montel.
Quick question, though.

218
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,467
How the hell are you
a financial spokesman?

219
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,300
"Hey, hey, everyone, isn't that
the guy who did that episode

220
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,800
"on how it's hard to be
the less pretty conjoined twin?

221
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:50,467
Everybody be quiet. This guy
might have some pretty sound
financial advice."

222
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,633
[Laughter]

223
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:54,467
When something is this popular
and this prevalent,

224
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,967
you owe it to yourself
to find out exactly what
it is, much in the way

225
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,367
that I finally gave in and read
all 4 "Twilight" books.

226
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,367
I'm on Team Bella,
by the way.

227
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,200
Team Bella. She doesn't need
a man to define her.

228
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:11,533
Team Bella, OK?
I'm on Team Bella.

229
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:14,067
[Cheers and applause]
Bella.

230
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:19,233
That's not the point.
The point is, what is
a payday loan?

231
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:20,900
What is a payday loan?

232
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:24,567
A payday loan is a quick way to
get the cash you need to cover

233
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,567
an unexpected expense, like
a car repair or doctor bill.

234
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,900
It's called a payday loan
because the loan balance

235
00:11:29,933 --> 00:11:32,633
is typically due
on your next payday.

236
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:35,300
Oh, that does makes sense.

237
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:39,133
I thought it was
a loan that you repaid
in PayDay candy bars.

238
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:42,467
Your way's better.
Your way is better than mine.

239
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,467
Clearly, this lady is
psychotically friendly

240
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,467
and also seems to have
an appealing product,

241
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,833
so how much might a company
charge for this sort of service?

242
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:57,700
Often it's 300 or 400 percentage
points on an annual basis.

243
00:11:57,733 --> 00:12:00,967
Average annual rates
of 570%.

244
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:05,833
Some of those rates legally
are as high as 1,900% a year.

245
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:08,833
1,900%.

246
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:11,833
Even the most demanding,
abusive football coaches

247
00:12:11,867 --> 00:12:14,833
only ask for 110.

248
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,667
"Hit him in the mouth, Billy!
Hit him in the mouth!"

249
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,333
Now, to be fair,

250
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:24,067
payday loan companies will say
these are short-term loans,

251
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:27,333
so an annual percentage rate
doesn't apply, which is true

252
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:29,833
if you pay them off immediately,

253
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:31,833
but many customers don't.

254
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:35,167
One study showed that 3/4
of the industry's volume

255
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,500
was generated by borrowers
who have to re-borrow

256
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40,500
before their next pay period.

257
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:44,667
Basically, payday loans are the
Lay's potato chips of finance.

258
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,667
You can't have just one,
and they're terrible for you.

259
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,167
[Laughter]

260
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,333
And it's when you start
missing payments

261
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:55,067
that you're susceptible
not just to frightening
levels of interest,

262
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:58,367
but also to fees that you
may not have been aware of.

263
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,933
I was, like, I'd say
maybe $6,000, like, deep.

264
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:05,600
You know, every payday,
I was here.

265
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:08,333
Every time I got paid,
I would pay it off and I
would get another one.

266
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:10,833
An endless cycle, a dead end.

267
00:13:10,867 --> 00:13:13,500
I would advise anybody not to.

268
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:18,067
MAN: I'd borrow 250,
I thought I would pay 325.

269
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:20,833
I actually paid $700,

270
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:23,500
but it would have been $1,100

271
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:27,367
had I not gone to the bank
and put a stop to this.

272
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,867
$1,100.

273
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,867
It is not often that
a metaphorical slippery slope

274
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,533
cost as much as
an actual ski vacation.

275
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:39,067
Payday loan companies
present themselves as a way

276
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:41,067
for you to get back
onto your feet.

277
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:43,067
They don't want you
to get trapped in debt.

278
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:45,700
In fact, they'll help you
if you fall behind.

279
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:48,667
Remember the friendly
ACE Cash lady from before?

280
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,700
What happens if you can't
pay back your loan?

281
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:53,200
Sometimes people have
a hard time paying us back,

282
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,900
and we'll be there to work
with you if that should happen.

283
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:58,633
Yeah, no shit you'll
be there for them.

284
00:13:58,667 --> 00:13:59,633
[Laughter]

285
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:01,633
Your business model
depends on it

286
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:05,133
because an actual ACE Cash
training manual for employees

287
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:06,933
featured a diagram which starts

288
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:08,267
with a customer applying

289
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,433
for an ACE loan,

290
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:10,767
moves through them spending

291
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,933
the money on that loan,

292
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,767
being unable to pay it back,

293
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,433
and then being forced to apply

294
00:14:15,467 --> 00:14:17,233
for an ACE loan again.

295
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:21,233
You'll notice that has
a certain roundness to it.

296
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:24,900
It's basically a recycling
symbol for human misery.

297
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:27,900
* It's the circle of debt

298
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:31,567
* And it screws us all

299
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,400
Now, obviously
we must not generalize
about this shitty industry.

300
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:39,900
Some companies hold themselves
to a higher standard.

301
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:43,733
In fact, the Community Financial
Services Association of America

302
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:46,233
insists that their
members are different

303
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:48,733
from the shadier elements
of the industry.

304
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:50,233
They even brag about it

305
00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:53,667
in one of the most boring
videos on the Internet.

306
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,833
In our industry,
I mean, let's be honest.

307
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:58,333
There are some
companies out there

308
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,733
that don't even
follow the law,

309
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,067
let alone follow
a standard

310
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:05,867
of best practices like
our member companies do.

311
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,867
"Oh, those other
companies are awful.

312
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,867
"Our member companies are
pillars of the community.

313
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,867
"Did you know that one of them
gave a kidney to a little girl
in a hospital?

314
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,533
"She was in there for
tonsillitis, but now
she has 3 kidneys.

315
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:21,700
We're good companies."

316
00:15:21,733 --> 00:15:26,367
So let's take a look
at their wonderful members
and their best practices.

317
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,367
First there's Advance America,

318
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,367
one of the biggest companies
in the industry,

319
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,867
whose co-founder defends
his business like this.

320
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,067
The consumer demand

321
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,867
for the product is overwhelming

322
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,700
and speaks for itself.

323
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:42,200
OK, that's fair, although it's
also worth pointing out

324
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:46,367
that the customer demand
for heroin is also overwhelming,

325
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,367
and that doesn't mean
it's a product you'd
necessarily recommend

326
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,367
to your friends
to get them out of a jam.

327
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,700
[Laughter]

328
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:54,200
Advance America is a company

329
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:56,167
whose best practices
somehow include

330
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,733
agreeing to an $18.75 million
settlement in North Carolina

331
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,833
after they were accused of
illegally high interest rates.

332
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:05,333
But they're just one

333
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:08,667
of the two largest companies
in the business.

334
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,833
The other company is
Cash America.

335
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:14,933
OK, so how do they practice
their best practices?

336
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:19,433
MAN: Cash America was ordered
to pay $19 million in refunds
and fines late last year

337
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:24,467
for illegally overcharging
service members and for
destroying documents.

338
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,633
Say what you like about that.

339
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:28,967
Illegally overcharging
service members

340
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:31,300
is a ballsy business practice.

341
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,800
They must have been
the ones driving around
with those bumper stickers

342
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:37,300
that say, "Extort Our Troops."

343
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,967
But settlements like those are
actually something of a rarity,

344
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:42,967
and that brings us to why
the payday loan industry

345
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:44,967
is seemingly unstoppable.

346
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:47,967
They are incredibly good
at avoiding regulation.

347
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:49,967
Just look at
one example in Texas.

348
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:54,300
They actually tried to rein in
the payday loan industry there
a few years ago,

349
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:58,400
but they faced opposition from
one particular state legislator.

350
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:03,467
Members, I just cannot see why
this legislation

351
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,633
could possibly be necessary

352
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:09,467
unless it is
the big institutions

353
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,333
trying to squeeze
the little guys.

354
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:15,333
And the "little guys"
in his analogy

355
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,333
are payday loan companies,

356
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:20,800
although I've got to say,
if you spell "little guys" with
a dollar sign instead of an "s,"

357
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:24,300
you've got yourself
a pretty good name for
a store right there.

358
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,967
That man is Texas State
Representative Gary Elkins,

359
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:30,133
and his proud defense
of the little guy

360
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:32,967
is about to get
a little muddier.

361
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:36,633
WOMAN: But isn't it true
that you have 12 very successful

362
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:40,700
payday and title loan locations
across this state?

363
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:42,700
[Audience murmuring]

364
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:44,867
Let me answer
that question for him.

365
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,200
It is true. It is true.
[Laughter]

366
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:52,200
He does, and they include
an outpost of the wonderfully
named Power Finance Texas.

367
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:53,367
[Laughter]

368
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,367
"Can I interest y'all
in some power finance?"

369
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,367
But I apologize.

370
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,100
I interrupted.

371
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:02,533
WOMAN: Isn't it true...
ELKINS: But we don't need
this regulation.

372
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:04,700
WOMAN: that you stand to add
to your personal wealth

373
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,867
considerably by killing
these bills?

374
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,367
[Person whistles]

375
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,867
You know what? That--
that is not about the bill.

376
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,633
WOMAN: Mr. Elkins, do you know
the meaning of the term
"conflict of interest"?

377
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:18,633
[Audience "oohs"]
"Oh, it's--do I know it?

378
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:23,133
Why, Madam, I am the physical
embodiment of that term
at this very moment."

379
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:25,867
Now, you might be thinking
that that woman,

380
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,700
Vicki Truitt, is awesome.

381
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:30,700
You know, fearlessly calling out
how the payday loan industry

382
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:35,200
influences politicians,
which is why it's going
to be so hard to tell you

383
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:37,933
that just 17 days
after leaving office,

384
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:41,267
she signed on as a lobbyist
for ACE Cash Express--

385
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,767
you know, the circle people.

386
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,767
Now, thankfully, Texas also has
a finance commission

387
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,267
which oversees
the payday loan industry.

388
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,400
Guess who runs that.

389
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:56,233
William J. White is
vice president of Cash America

390
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:58,900
and was also appointed
by the governor

391
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:01,567
as chairman of the state's
finance commission,

392
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,867
which oversees
payday loan outfits.

393
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,367
That's right.

394
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,867
The chairman of the commission

395
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,067
that oversees
the payday loan industry

396
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:13,067
is also, at the same time,
a vice president

397
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:15,867
of one of the biggest payday
loan companies in the country.

398
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,867
I call dingo.
I call dingo on that man.

399
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,367
I call dingo on him!
I call dingo!

400
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,867
Dingo, dingo, dingo!

401
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,067
So let's just quickly
break all of that down.

402
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:31,867
If you are hoping to
protect Texans from the
payday loan industry,

403
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,367
you would need to approach
a commission overseen
by the vice president

404
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,867
of a payday loan company
and then introduce a bill

405
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,067
into the state legislature,
where the owner
of 12 payday loan stores

406
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:46,367
will debate the merits of
the payday loan industry

407
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,367
with one of the payday
loan industry's future
fucking lobbyists.

408
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,700
Apparently even cluster fucks
are bigger in Texas.

409
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:55,533
[Laughter]

410
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:59,700
But the truly chilling skill
payday loan companies have

411
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:02,700
is not how they prevent
legislation from getting passed.

412
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:05,200
It's how they react
when it gets through.

413
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:10,367
For instance, when Illinois
passed an act which applied
to loans of up to 120 days,

414
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,367
companies simply began
offering loans with terms
of 121 days instead,

415
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,200
which is like betting a dollar
on "The Price Is Right."

416
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:21,700
You're technically allowed
to do it, but, you know,

417
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:23,033
fuck you!

418
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:25,033
[Laughter]
Now, it gets worse.

419
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:27,700
When Arizona outlawed
payday loans,

420
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:31,033
many companies shifted
to selling title loans instead,

421
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:34,700
which are basically the same,
except they also get
to take your car.

422
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,500
For regulators,

423
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:39,033
it's like playing
legislative Whack-a-Mole.

424
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:41,033
Just when you think you've
squashed them down,

425
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:43,700
somewhere up they pop up
somewhere else,

426
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:46,033
wearing a completely
different outfit.

427
00:20:46,067 --> 00:20:48,200
And the most amazing example

428
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:50,400
of all of this
took place in Ohio.

429
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:54,900
In 2008, they somehow capped
payday loan rates at 28%.

430
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:59,400
Any company licensed as
a short-term lender had
to abide by that.

431
00:20:59,433 --> 00:21:02,467
But, where one mole falls,

432
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,800
another mole shall rise.

433
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,800
And as of last year,

434
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:10,800
there were no businesses in Ohio
licensed to short-term lenders.

435
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,633
There was, however,
a sudden increase of companies

436
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:15,967
registering as mortgage lenders,

437
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:20,300
offering people short-term
mortgages of around $300.

438
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,967
Watch now

439
00:21:22,067 --> 00:21:24,300
as the lawyer for
a company called Cashland

440
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,567
explains this to a judge.

441
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,067
JUDGE: So Cashland
would not be subject, then,

442
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,700
to the Short-Term Loan Act

443
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:34,700
because it's not registered
as a short-term lender?

444
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:36,200
MAN: Exactly, Your Honor.

445
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:39,533
The Short-Term Loan Act by
the legislative enactment says

446
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:43,933
it applies only to those
who register under
the Short-Term Loan Act.

447
00:21:43,967 --> 00:21:45,267
[Laughter]

448
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,267
Why even bother calling
yourselves mortgage lenders?

449
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,767
Why not just call yourselves
Peanut Butter Octopus Companies?

450
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,267
Yeah. You can't regulate
peanut butter octopi.

451
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,767
They don't technically exist.

452
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,767
And in the rare case

453
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,267
where states succeed in imposing
stringent regulations,

454
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:08,400
some payday loan companies have
one final trick up their sleeve.

455
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:10,900
Now, some payday lenders
have found a loophole

456
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:12,567
by partnering with
Indian tribes.

457
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,733
That gives payday lenders
the cover of sovereign immunity

458
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,900
to avoid state regulations.

459
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:19,900
[Audience groans]
That's right.

460
00:22:19,933 --> 00:22:23,067
Some payday lenders are
currently dressing themselves up

461
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,733
as Native Americans.

462
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:27,233
I thought only Johnny Depp
was allowed to do that.

463
00:22:27,267 --> 00:22:28,733
[Laughter]

464
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:31,600
How does that even work?

465
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:34,267
MAN: This payday lender,
Cash Fairy, has teamed up

466
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,933
with the Fort Belknap
Indian tribe in Montana,

467
00:22:36,967 --> 00:22:38,433
and as you can see,
they are charging

468
00:22:38,467 --> 00:22:41,433
online interest rates
in the 700% range.

469
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:45,433
SECOND MAN: If you can become
affiliated with a tribe

470
00:22:45,467 --> 00:22:49,433
and be able to avert local
and state laws, in my opinion,

471
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:52,167
apparently loan-sharking is
still legal in this country.

472
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,667
It's true, although
let's be fair.

473
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,833
No loan shark would ever go by
the name Cash Fairy.

474
00:22:57,867 --> 00:23:00,900
"Hey, hey, you better get me
that money by midnight,

475
00:23:00,933 --> 00:23:03,667
"or you're gonna get a visit
from the Cash Fairy.

476
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,167
The Cash Fairy."

477
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,167
Here's the problem.

478
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,067
Payday loan companies
are almost impossible

479
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:14,500
to effectively regulate,
and they are not going anywhere.

480
00:23:14,533 --> 00:23:17,833
A Pew survey found that
a majority of borrowers said

481
00:23:17,867 --> 00:23:22,333
payday loans take advantage of
them, but a majority also said

482
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:26,500
they provide relief, and that is
why they are so dangerous.

483
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:29,167
People sometimes need them,
but you have to be

484
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,833
absolutely sure there are
no better options.

485
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:37,333
Apparently 41% of those surveyed
who'd taken out payday loans

486
00:23:37,367 --> 00:23:40,167
ended up having to borrow
from family or pawn possessions

487
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,500
or other things that they could
have done in the first place,

488
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:46,167
just to pay off
that payday loan.

489
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,067
And yet, payday loans
superficially do look easier.

490
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:52,500
All these commercials,
they're enticing

491
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:55,067
and they're also everywhere.

492
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:58,167
The least we can do is
launch a counter-campaign

493
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,233
with a celebrity spokesperson
of our own to remind people

494
00:24:02,267 --> 00:24:06,667
to make sure they explore all
their better options first.

495
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,667
Hi, I'm Sarah Silverman.

496
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,167
If you're considering
taking out a payday loan,

497
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,833
I'd like to tell you about
a great alternative.

498
00:24:13,867 --> 00:24:16,333
It's called Anything Else.

499
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:19,333
The way it works is, instead
of taking out a payday loan,

500
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:21,733
you literally do
anything else.

501
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:24,233
Sell your sperm.
Sell some blood.

502
00:24:24,267 --> 00:24:26,567
Throw yourself in front
of a rich guy's car.

503
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,800
He'll throw money at the problem
just to make that shit go away.

504
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:32,267
Are you an old person
and need money?

505
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,267
Take things. You're old.

506
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,900
No one's gonna stop you.
You're not gonna go to jail.

507
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,567
Go to the grocery store
right now, fill up a cart

508
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,067
with everything you need,
and walk the fuck outta there.

509
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,733
You know what? People will
pay you to pee on them.

510
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:49,533
That's true. Doodies, too.
Doodies are more, like double.

511
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:52,067
I know this for a fact.
I...

512
00:24:52,067 --> 00:24:55,633
It doesn't matter, but it's
something that you have to do
every day anyway, right?

513
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:59,633
By not doing it, you are
literally flushing money
down the toilet.

514
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:03,067
It's irresponsible.
There's money inside of you.

515
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:06,500
It's like Dorothy having
the power to go home
the whole time.

516
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:09,500
The point is, no decision
in your life will be worse

517
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:12,500
than dealing with these
payday loan motherfuckers.

518
00:25:12,533 --> 00:25:14,067
They're motherfuckers.

519
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:16,067
They're fuckers of mothers.

520
00:25:16,067 --> 00:25:19,067
So if you're thinking
about getting a payday loan,

521
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:21,067
just simply pick up the phone,

522
00:25:21,067 --> 00:25:24,500
then put it down again
and do literally anything else.

523
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:26,067
Do it now.

524
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,067
[Cheers and applause]

525
00:25:28,067 --> 00:25:32,500
Finally tonight,
finally tonight, Russia.

526
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:34,667
Ever since their
annexation of Crimea,

527
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,333
sanctions between Russia and
America have been escalating,

528
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:41,233
and this week, they took
tensions to a brand-new level.

529
00:25:41,267 --> 00:25:43,400
WOMAN: First,
the foreign minister
tweeted pictures

530
00:25:43,433 --> 00:25:45,400
of President Putin
holding a cheetah

531
00:25:45,433 --> 00:25:47,567
and President Obama
holding a poodle,

532
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,900
and then there is this--
a laser light show in Moscow

533
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:54,067
showing President Obama
eating a banana

534
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,267
and also wishing him
happy birthday.

535
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,100
OK.

536
00:25:58,133 --> 00:26:00,500
To be honest, if you
told me 50 years ago

537
00:26:00,533 --> 00:26:03,767
that Russia would one day attack
the United States with lasers,

538
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,767
this would not have been
what I was expecting.

539
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,767
Also, also,

540
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,933
to be honest,
that was not the work of
the Russian government.

541
00:26:11,967 --> 00:26:16,433
It was a bunch of Russian
students, presumably from
their racist A.V. Club.

542
00:26:16,467 --> 00:26:20,100
This, however, was
the Russian government.

543
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:22,933
Putin has banned food imports
to Russia, for one year,

544
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:25,267
including fruit and
vegetables from Europe,

545
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:29,767
beef and pork from Australia,
and soybeans and chicken
from the U.S.

546
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,767
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

547
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,600
Putin doesn't want
our soybeans and chicken?

548
00:26:34,633 --> 00:26:38,100
Slow your roll, Russia, 'cause
let's get one thing clear here.

549
00:26:38,133 --> 00:26:40,600
You break up with
our chicken and soybeans,

550
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:43,100
the relationship is over, OK?

551
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:45,433
Our chickens and
soybeans are single.

552
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:47,433
They're free to roam,
which they're gonna want to.

553
00:26:47,467 --> 00:26:50,100
Some of them have been kept
in appalling conditions, but
that's not the point here.

554
00:26:50,133 --> 00:26:51,433
That's not the point.

555
00:26:51,467 --> 00:26:53,433
The point is, they are free
to get right up

556
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:55,433
in the mouth
of whoever they want to.

557
00:26:55,467 --> 00:26:57,967
I'm warning you, Russia,
I'll put U.S. chicken

558
00:26:58,067 --> 00:26:59,467
on Tinder right now.

559
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,067
There it is.
This is real.

560
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:04,867
Check Tinder right now.
It's actually there.

561
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,200
Some pervert with
a chicken fetish

562
00:27:07,233 --> 00:27:09,200
just hit the fucking jackpot.

563
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:12,367
As for soybeans,
they're already on Grindr.

564
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,367
That's right.
Soybeans are gay.

565
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,367
Soybeans are gay. How is that
a surprise to people?

566
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,867
But I'm not
just gonna tell you

567
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,367
what you're giving up
with these sanctions, Russia.

568
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,867
I'm gonna show you.
Come on out here, chicken.

569
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,367
Come on out.

570
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,867
And don't look away, Russia,

571
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,867
because look who is single

572
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,867
and ready to mingle.

573
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,533
Oh, yeah.

574
00:27:34,567 --> 00:27:36,867
Work that pole
like a rotisserie,

575
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,867
you dirty bird.

576
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,367
Look, don't touch,
Russia.

577
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,133
You don't want this,
remember?

578
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:47,433
The party fowl
is on the prowl.

579
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:49,933
And--uh-oh, uh-oh!

580
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:52,100
For you vegetarians
out there,

581
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:55,100
we've got a little treat
out here on the main stage.

582
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:57,633
Edamame, oh, my.

583
00:27:57,667 --> 00:28:01,133
Russia, you just gave up
a utility bean.

584
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:04,300
Oh, yeah.
Look at him.

585
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:07,800
This bean is so hot,
he's steaming himself.

586
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:11,300
Drop the sanctions, Russia.
Drop the sanctions.

587
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:13,300
That's it for
our show this week.

588
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,300
Our thanks
to Sarah Silverman,

589
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:18,533
plus the proud
American chicken
and soybean.

590
00:28:18,567 --> 00:28:20,533
We'll see you next week.

591
00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:24,267
*

592
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,533
Payday loan mofos.

593
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:28,533
Payday loan...

594
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:30,200
pussy lickers.

595
00:28:30,233 --> 00:28:31,700
What about the pay--um,

596
00:28:31,733 --> 00:28:33,700
instead of payday loan
motherfuckers,

597
00:28:33,733 --> 00:28:35,667
payday loan cunts?

598
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,067
Suck a dick. Suck a dick.

599
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:39,667
Suck a dick.

600
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,067
That was genius.

601
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:44,067
[Cheers and applause]

602
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:44,133
