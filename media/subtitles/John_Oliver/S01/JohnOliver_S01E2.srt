LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

3
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,480
Episode 2

4
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,040
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I am John Oliver.

5
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,560
Thank you for being with us.
A quick recap of the week.

6
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,680
If you're watching this show
in eastern Ukraine

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,880
or as it may be called by the time
that this show airs, western Russia,

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,320
then, don't worry:

9
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,880
Vladimir Putin is seizing some of your
towns like they're Super Bowl rings,

10
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,040
but rest assured: the international
community is behind you.

11
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,120
If Russia continues, we have
a range of tools at our disposal,

12
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,840
including sanctions that target
sectors of the Russian economy.

13
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,880
Sanctions! You're welcome,
Ukraine, everything's going to be fine.

14
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,720
That's kind of our go to move.
We impose sanctions the way

15
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,760
Pizza Hut crams mozzarella into
every crevice of a pizza crust.

16
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,440
It's kind of what we do when
we're out of ideas.

17
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:34,200
This week also showed how little
regard Putin has for sanctions.

18
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,920
New York Times is reporting
that US sanctions over Ukraine

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,640
are having a limited impact on
Russia as Vladimir Putin demand

20
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,040
ukrainian troops withdraw
from south-east of the country.

21
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,800
You know it's not a good sign

22
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,360
when Putin tells you to withdraw
troops from your own country.

23
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,160
That is true but to be fair,

24
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,560
it's also it's not a good sign when
Putin tells you anything.

25
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,120
If Putin leans in to whisper
something into your ear,

26
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,480
best case scenario,
he's gonna bite your ear off.

27
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,640
That's the best thing that could
happen in that circumstance.

28
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,240
Ukraine would have been the talk
of the town in Washington this week.

29
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,840
If they hadn't spent the week
party planning for last night.

30
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,960
The White House Correspondents
Dinner called nerd prom.

31
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,680
We call it the nerd prom.

32
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,400
- Nerd prom.
- This weekend.

33
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Nerd prom!
It's even worse than it sounds.

34
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,720
It is the annual alarming display
of coziness where you can see

35
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,440
such majestic sights as National
Security Advisor Susan Rice

36
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,200
asking for an autograph
from the guy from "Duck Dynasty".

37
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,240
Both of them could justifiably
look at the other one and say:

38
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,280
"what the fuck
are you doing here?"

39
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,880
And they'd both be right.
It's a night when journalists celebrate

40
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,000
their independence by hanging
out with their sources

41
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,680
and celebrate their importance
by utterly ignoring one another

42
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,480
in favor of Hollywood stars.

43
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,440
The main purpose of the evening
seems to be providing photos

44
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,840
of celebrities unaware
of who they're standing next to.

45
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,920
She has no idea, with that person
in question usually being Wolf Blitzer.

46
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,520
Can I be in the photo?

47
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,080
Surely this wasn't what the founders
of the Correspondents' Association

48
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,080
had in mind 100 years ago.

49
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,000
Let's look at their original charter.

50
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,320
I wish I could show you that charter.
Because it's our most prized artifact.

51
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,920
I wish you could
show it to me too then.

52
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,080
If you're wondering why he's referring
to it in the conditional sense,

53
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,080
it's because during the renovation
of the White House Press Room,

54
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,520
the Association handed over
their charter for safekeeping,

55
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,840
and well...

56
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,320
When they cut the ribbon,
the White House lost our charter.

57
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,760
You weren't really using it anyway,
perhaps you could replace it

58
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,880
with a framed photo
of Wolf Blitzer with Sofia Vergara.

59
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,640
And now this.

60
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:43,200
Newscasters enjoying a pun about
today's date a little too much.

61
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm a massive Star Wars nerd,

62
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,200
it's Star War's day when we say
may the fourth be with you.

63
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,520
- Happy Star Wars day!
- May the fourth be with you.

64
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,080
Obviously it's May the fourth
be with you.

65
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,120
I speak droid guys, he just said
"may the fourth be with you."

66
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,680
May the fourth be with you,
get it?

67
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,560
That's a take on the force be
with you.

68
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,360
Today is Star War's day
maybe the fourth one

69
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,080
or should we just say
just the fourth be with you.

70
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,720
Moving on...

71
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,240
Our show is dedicated to covering
the biggest news of the week.

72
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,920
Whatever that news may be.

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,600
We have a long, proud
one week history of doing that.

74
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,640
What was the biggest
news story of this week?

75
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,400
We begin in Oklahoma, with an
execution that did not go as planned.

76
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,200
A convicted killer from Oklahoma
dies after a botched execution.

77
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,840
Okay,
I know what you're thinking:

78
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,800
you're not gonna really do a comic
take on the death penalty, right?

79
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,920
It's the second episode! I haven't
decided if I like this show yet.

80
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,160
You're right!
Don't change the channel.

81
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,560
We don't talk about the death
penalty. No one is forcing us to.

82
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,680
In the application of the death penalty
we have seen significant problems.

83
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:20,240
We as a society have to ask ourselves
some difficult and profound questions.

84
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,960
Do we really have to do that?
Can you not just answer those for us?

85
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,520
I don't want to talk
about the death penalty.

86
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,920
Judging by the noise you make when
you talk about it, neither do you.

87
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,960
What happened in Oklahoma
was troubling and...

88
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,680
I know that sound.

89
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,800
That's the sound of a man
drowning on dry land.

90
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,760
Desperately hoping for Biden
to suddenly walk out

91
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,120
into the rose garden
in an open robe.

92
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,880
God, Joe! Joe's here!
Thank god you're here.

93
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,080
Let's lighten the mood,
let's talk about Benghazi.

94
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,680
Okay. So let's do this then.
Let's talk about the death penalty.

95
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,400
Before you turn this show off,
there was a YouTube video

96
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,560
of tiny hamsters
eating tiny burritos.

97
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,840
And it's as magical and uncomplicated
as you think.

98
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,000
If you make it to the end,
we will watch it together, okay?

99
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,440
But you have to stay with us
to get it.

100
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,920
The death penalty.
Should it exist?

101
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,560
What should its limits be?
Can someone give me a broad,

102
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,680
almost infantile guideline
of when they think it's appropriate.

103
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,360
The Supreme Court told us that
it is constitutional.

104
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,200
I believe in death penalty,

105
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,360
but only to those who
are guilty of committing the crime.

106
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,480
Okay. Bold idea.
We shouldn't execute innocent people.

107
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,680
I think most people would
probably agree with that.

108
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,920
You, sir, are a regular
Atticus Finch.

109
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,480
Executing the innocent
is not the tough question here.

110
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,240
It's whether
we should be executing the guilty.

111
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,000
And let me acknowledge up front
that I come to this as an outsider.

112
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,920
Britain does not have
capital punishment.

113
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,720
So in a way, I don't know
what I'm talking about.

114
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,240
But in another way, I really "do"
know what I'm talking about.

115
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,600
Because before 1965, we didn't
just have capital punishment.

116
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,800
We literally went medieval
on people's asses.

117
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,560
The history of capital punishment
in Britain is a long and bloody one.

118
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,840
Since the middle ages,
those condemned to death

119
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,520
have variously faced being boiled
alive, burnt at the stake,

120
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,720
or hung, drawn and quartered.

121
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,080
Yep. We did that.
We boiled people.

122
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,960
And in the grand tradition
of British cuisine,

123
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,640
if anything we over boiled them.

124
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,240
We loved killing people so much
we kept coming up with new,

125
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,480
inventive techniques that looked
like they were designed

126
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,160
by the Marquis de Sade
and named by Willy Wonka.

127
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,520
The Headcrusher.

128
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,880
The small and seemingly innocuous
"Thumb Biter"

129
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,400
originates in 14th century Scotland.

130
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,160
These devices have almost childlike
names. Like Penny Winkies.

131
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,120
That's right, Penny Winkies!

132
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,880
A delightful English cousin
of the Throaty Tug-tug,

133
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,720
and the Jolly Shocky Buzz Buzz
Tickly Wickly seat.

134
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,000
I know all of that is still technically
horrifying but that's the point.

135
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,920
Whether you are boiling people alive
or putting them to sleep

136
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,200
with a tiny injection administered by
a puppy dressed as Winnie the Pooh,

137
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,080
in the end
you are getting the same result.

138
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,320
Just because the British people
don't have the death penalty anymore,

139
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,560
doesn't mean
we don't want it back.

140
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,120
Recent polls suggest that
at least half the population

141
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,920
would choose to have it reinstated,
which makes complete sense.

142
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,520
The death penalty is one of those
things that is natural to want

143
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,880
but shouldn't necessarily have.

144
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,680
The death penalty
is like the McRib.

145
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,920
When you can't have it,
it's so tantalizing.

146
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,120
But as soon as they bring it back,
you think "this is ethically wrong".

147
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,520
Should this be allowed
in a civilized society?

148
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,920
And by the way,
here's your new slogan, McRib.

149
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,320
You are welcome and you can have
that for free, that's yours.

150
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,280
There are things
about having the death penalty

151
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,920
which might make you
a little bit queasy.

152
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,440
What does the US have in common
with Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia?

153
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,800
The answer is the death penalty.
According to Amnesty International,

154
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,360
those nations and China are responsible
for 82% of the world's executions.

155
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,000
This is going to seem
like a gross simplification.

156
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,120
Any list that contains Iran, Iraq,
Saudi Arabia and China

157
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,440
is "not" a list
you want to be on.

158
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,960
Ideally, you want to be on one
of those lists that Finland is on.

159
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,880
Finland's on all the good lists. Like
"countries with the best pastries".

160
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,440
Or "best countries to host
your overseas lesbian wedding".

161
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,080
I know what some
of you are thinking:

162
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,400
"I hear you saying that most western
countries no longer have executions,"

163
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,040
"but if someone committed
a heinous crime,"

164
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,400
"I'd still very much
like to kill them."

165
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,600
Okay.
Well, let's start with "if" !

166
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,160
There have been
312 DNA exonerations

167
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,920
since we've been doing
forensic testing.

168
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,720
Isn't it interesting how things
which were once considered

169
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:19,840
complete air tight evidence are now
being viewed as junk science?

170
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,920
Isn't it interesting?

171
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,120
Is interesting really the word
you're looking for, Cooper?

172
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,360
Facts found on Snapple caps
are interesting.

173
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,600
The statue of liberty's nose
is four feet six inches long.

174
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,760
That's an "interesting" fact.
But facts like innocent people

175
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,360
are potentially executed by our
government on a regular basis

176
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,720
are fucking horrifying.

177
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,040
If you found that on the bottom
of a Chobani lid,

178
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,200
that would make a container of Chobani
harder to swallow than it already is.

179
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,840
Look, statistics suggest that false
convictions aren't all that rare.

180
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,520
We're learning from the proceedings
of the national academy of sciences

181
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,080
a study that shows 4% of death row
inmates are innocent.

182
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:25,280
I think that might be
the wrong tone. Four percent!

183
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,480
The outrage about this
must be off the charts.

184
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,680
A certain Texas Governor felt
that four cases of voter impersonation

185
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,120
in the last decade was a moral
issue important to address.

186
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,360
Any person who does not want
to see fraud

187
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,760
believes in having good, open,
honest elections, transparent.

188
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,720
We'll take it to the Supreme Court.

189
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,520
To the Supreme Court!

190
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,240
Over a voter impersonation rate
essentially close to zero percent.

191
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,240
So a potential executing the innocent
rate of four percent

192
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,600
must really eat away at Rick Perry.

193
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,240
Your state has executed
234 death row inmates,

194
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,880
more than any other governor
in modern times.

195
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,440
Have you struggled to sleep at night
with the idea

196
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,000
that any one of those
might have been innocent?

197
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,440
I've never
struggled with that at all.

198
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,080
Nope. I never struggled with it.
In fact, I sleep great.

199
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,320
Like a big muscular baby.
14 hours a night.

200
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,880
Legs in the air,
with a mobile above my head.

201
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:44,040
Crying when I shit myself,
I'm a big baby, I sleep like a baby.

202
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,400
Let's imagine for a moment
a magical world

203
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,080
where you could be sure
of someone's guilt.

204
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,880
What would be the argument for
killing? Is it a deterrent to others?

205
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,360
There is no credible evidence
that the death penalty

206
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,400
is a deterrent to violent crime.

207
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:09,040
The death penalty is an amazing
deterrent to fishing without a license.

208
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,240
I'd love to go, but is it worth it
you've got a wife and children.

209
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,000
So, what about the argument that
we shouldn't have to pay

210
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,280
to house
and feed a convicted killer?

211
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,520
An average death penalty case costs
the state millions of dollars.

212
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,160
In California alone, since 1978,

213
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:34,040
the total cost of enforcing the death
penalty has been over $4 billion.

214
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,360
That's $308 million for each
of the 13 executions carried out.

215
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,920
It costs up to ten times more to give
someone the death penalty

216
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,240
than life in prison.

217
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,920
So what a death sentence
is really saying is:

218
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,280
"This is America and the way we treat
the despicable members of society"

219
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,520
"is spending the entire budget of
the Lord of the Rings trilogy on them."

220
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,800
So the death penalty is expensive,
potentially kills innocent people

221
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,600
and it doesn't deter crime.

222
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,960
Here is where it gets hard.
Harder than is potentially appropriate

223
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,360
for a comedy show
late on a Sunday night.

224
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,760
But if we are going to answer
difficult and profound questions,

225
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,880
as the President told us to,
the toughest one is probably:

226
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,440
"if someone is guilty
of committing a horrible crime"

227
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,000
"and the family of the victim
want the perpetrator executed,"

228
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,640
"do we want to live in the kind
of country that gives that to them?"

229
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:40,520
I would say "no".
You might very reasonably say "yes".

230
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,840
Or at the very least...

231
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,120
But it's a question that is going
to need an answer

232
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,760
and in the meantime
a much easier question is:

233
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,480
do you want to watch a YouTube
video of a tiny hamster

234
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,160
eating a tiny burrito?

235
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,960
Because at this point,
you have fucking earned it.

236
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,520
That is how you end a comprehensive
segment on the death penalty.

237
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,440
And now this:

238
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,000
America, everyone knows
it's the greatest nation on earth

239
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,920
and our leaders are
the greatest leaders on earth

240
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,680
but did you know there are other
countries that are not America?

241
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,040
Each of them
has a leader of it's very own.

242
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,200
Let's take a moment to meet
one in our ongoing series:

243
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,680
"Other countries'
Presidents of the United States."

244
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,560
This week's leader:

245
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,120
Francois Hollande. Francois Holland.

246
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,680
Francois Hollande.

247
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,760
That's right, Francois Hollande,
the President of France,

248
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,440
the country where your cousin spent
a three month study abroad

249
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,360
and the rest of his life over
emphasizing the word croissant.

250
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,840
Interestingly, Hollande is rare
among world leaders

251
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,920
in that he's publicly questioned
the existence of God

252
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,240
which perhaps explains why on his
inauguration day this happened:

253
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,080
Hollande was on his way to meet
with Angela Merkel in Berlin

254
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,280
when his plane
was hit by lightning.

255
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,600
Hollande is a committed Socialist.

256
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,440
Not only believing that France
should have a public investment bank

257
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,280
and that the retirement age
should begin at sixty

258
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,960
but also his body should be shared
with as many women as possible.

259
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,880
Yes, Francois is probably
most famous for his love life

260
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,560
which rivals that of France's
notorious President LePew.

261
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,840
We can do away with
the dull preliminaries.

262
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,640
Hollande has four children
with Segolene Royal

263
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,480
a fellow Socialist who also ran
for President

264
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,760
only to lose to Nicholas Sarkozy.

265
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,440
Hollande chose to comfort his partner

266
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,320
by leaving her for his younger
mistress, Valerie Trierweiller.

267
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,040
An act so heartless the French
people decided to punish him

268
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,840
by electing him
to the highest office in the land.

269
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,360
But wait, there's more.

270
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,080
Hollande then cheated on his mistress
with another mistress.

271
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,040
Sneaking out of the Presidential Palace
to meet her on a scooter,

272
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,600
a sequence of events so stereotypically
French it's almost offensive.

273
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,480
We introduce you to Francois Hollande,
who dumped a presidential candidate

274
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,400
and became president himself,
a man who evicted a First Lady,

275
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,760
an action which somehow
increased his approval rating

276
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,360
and the only man who managed
to pick-up a movie star mistress

277
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,400
while riding on a scooter.

278
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,640
Who says there's no God?

279
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:05,520
Let's move on, there was
big news this week out of Brunei.

280
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,840
Wait, let me back up a second.
There is a country called Brunei.

281
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,880
It's located "here" in Southeast Asia.

282
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,280
Specifically, it's located here,
on the island of Borneo.

283
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,480
There's big news
from Brunei there this week.

284
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,920
At a ceremony
on Wednesday morning,

285
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,440
the sultan announced that Brunei's
experiment with Sharia Law had begun.

286
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,960
Okay.
Sharia law is one of those scary terms

287
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,240
your grandma sends you email
forwards about

288
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,520
because a guy who looked Muslim cut
in front of her at the grocery store.

289
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,560
What does this new law entail?

290
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,000
In about a year those guilty of theft
or consuming alcohol will be punished

291
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,640
with a whipping or even amputations.

292
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,760
And in two years, the death penalty
will be implemented for crimes

293
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,240
like blasphemy, sodomy
or insulting the Quran.

294
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,360
Holy shit. I guess
this explains Brunei's new slogan:

295
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,760
"Brunei is for lovers, only within
the bounds of heterosexual marriage."

296
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:13,360
I know I should be careful. And maybe
this sultan is a devout, pious man,

297
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,800
obeying the strict tenets
of his faith.

298
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,600
He's worth more
than 20 billion dollars.

299
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,720
He owns a fleet of more than 5000
luxury cars and his own 747.

300
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,920
His family includes 12 children by 3
wives, lives in a 1788 room palace.

301
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,920
I'm not really getting
"humility" off of this,

302
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,080
so much as Donald Trump
times Richard Brandson

303
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,080
to the Scrooge McDuckth power.

304
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,560
His most incredible display of wealth

305
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,080
was the surprise party
he threw for himself back in 1996.

306
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,280
It has been Brunei's
most lavish party ever.

307
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,840
A two week $25 million dollar bash

308
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,880
thrown by sultan Hassanal Bolkiah
for his 50th birthday.

309
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,200
Michael Jackson, the sultan's favorite
pop star gave a public concert.

310
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,760
As a gift to the fans the sultan
picked up the tab for the concert,

311
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,240
which he did not attend.

312
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,800
He did not attend,
that is a power move.

313
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,400
Fly Michael Jackson around
the world to perform for you

314
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,880
and then you don't turn up
to the concert.

315
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,840
I'm just too rich to give a shit.
And it's not just wealth.

316
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,720
It's a little hard to take strict
moral guidelines from a man

317
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,000
whose own brother
owned a yacht called "Tits",

318
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,400
with service boats called
"Nipple 1" and "Nipple 2".

319
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,960
You're not the moral
authority of your country,

320
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,120
you're just
Jeremy Piven with money.

321
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,880
The Sultan's brother even stocked
his estate on Long Island

322
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,600
with these actual graphic statues
of himself having sex.

323
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,600
I'd say that's not classy,

324
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,680
but to be honest it's classiest
thing on Long Island.

325
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,680
Come at me!

326
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,960
So rank hypocrisy and vicious
antihomosexuality laws.

327
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,520
And yet... A lack of condemnation
from any major countries.

328
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,120
And that's because Brunei
falls under the Saudi Arabia rule:

329
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,760
if you're a tiny, wealthy,
strategically located country

330
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,680
with oily business underneath you,
the whole world is your friend.

331
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,720
Remember the British Royal
wedding? Because the Sultan does.

332
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,320
And here we have
the Sultan of Brunei coming in,

333
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:43,400
the Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah
and he is there with his wife.

334
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,480
Yeah, he was there
and he had good seats, too!

335
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,320
Who's that over William's shoulder?
There he is! Literally courtside!

336
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,760
If something had gone wrong,

337
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,920
he could've tapped in and
got himself wife number four.

338
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,760
Remember the last G20 summit?
Because guess who's there!

339
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,640
It's the Sultan of Brunei!
Brunei's not even in the G20.

340
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,280
The Sultan just doesn't give a shit,
he just turns up anyway.

341
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,880
He had face to face sit downs with
each of the last three presidents.

342
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,440
It is a great pleasure to welcome
my good friend,

343
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,000
his majesty the sultan of Brunei.

344
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:28,320
For context: Brunei has a population
of 420000 people.

345
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,200
For scale, the population
of Staten Island is 470000.

346
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:39,520
I don't remember seeing Staten Island
borough president James P. Molinaro

347
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,760
getting a sit down
with the president.

348
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:48,760
Although, to be honest,
he's a lot less fun than the Sultan.

349
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,640
Molinaro's last big birthday
took place at a Sizzler

350
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,040
with entertainment from
a Jermaine Jackson impersonator.

351
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,080
I'm kidding.

352
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,280
It was actually
far less exciting than that.

353
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,160
A happy birthday to our borough
president James Molinaro

354
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,960
who turned 80 years young.

355
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,520
He recieved flowers and
several phone calls in his office.

356
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,480
I'm gonna guess that none
of those were from the President.

357
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And the sad thing is,
we in America were on such a roll

358
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,240
of condemning antigay legislation
around the world

359
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,920
in places like Uganda
or, recently, in Russia.

360
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,000
I have no patience for countries

361
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,600
that try to treat gays or lesbians
or transgender persons

362
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,640
in ways that intimidate them
or are harmful to them.

363
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,520
I have no patience,
I might try to build some up.

364
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,000
You never know
when it might come in handy.

365
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,640
There was no public statement
on Brunei's law

366
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,160
from the State Department
at all this week.

367
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,440
We even called them! And we're
nobody. They explicitly told us that.

368
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,120
Although there was one group
this week that took a stand.

369
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,040
It's also led to several celebrities
boycotting the Beverly Hills Hotel,

370
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,440
which the sultan owns.

371
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,240
I've got to say congratulations
to the city of Los Angeles.

372
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,800
It can't have be easy to within
a week discover you have

373
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,160
a worse billionaire owner
than this guy.

374
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,040
The most public statement
of condemnation this week

375
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,000
came from Ellen's Twitter feed,

376
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,160
where she said she would be
boycotting hotels the sultan owns.

377
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,520
Take that, sultan!

378
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,600
You might get a pass from every
government on earth,

379
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:50,600
but you do not piss off
the people's republic of Ellen.

380
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,000
You don't do it,
you don't do that!

381
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:03,680
It's too bad, the sultan was
one of my favorite Ellen guests.

382
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,080
Look at him dance!

383
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,840
That's just natural rhythm.

384
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:16,240
You know who I feel the worst
other than everyone in Brunei?

385
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,080
Their tourism authority. They're
gonna have to change their ads now.

386
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,360
When it's time to go back
to the values of sincerity and purity,

387
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,040
there is always Brunei.

388
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,840
Brunei Al DaraSalaam,
a kingdom of unexpected treasures.

389
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,560
That's nice, but you are going to want
to at least change the end of that.

390
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,960
Brunei Al DaraSalaam.

391
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,920
We're on top of a shit ton of oil.
What've you got?

392
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,160
Nothing is the answer and now this:

393
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,040
People falling asleep behind
politicians.

394
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,360
Understand that your success in life
won't be determined

395
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,640
just by what's given to you
or what happens to you.

396
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,680
No one can outcompete us,

397
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,680
there's no country in the world
that can outcompete us.

398
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,760
I'll have the answer
about whether I even could.

399
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,120
And our allies are so much
less willing to trust us.

400
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,040
We need to make sure
the American people

401
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,120
are given just a fighting chance.

402
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,560
We must do these things together
as one nation and one people.

403
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,520
Corporate Japan is gonna overtake
the USA.

404
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,240
The common refrain is more care and
less Rick but I'm working on it.

405
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,400
There's folks on the left that try
to be purposely provocative

406
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,120
saying the meanest, nastiest things
about the other side.

407
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,800
The social problems they have to deal
with are incomprehensible.

408
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,680
We stand for freedom
and hope and opportunity.

409
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,160
I know that you can do it,
after all you are the Giants

410
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,160
and with the education here
there is nothing that you can't do.

411
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,680
