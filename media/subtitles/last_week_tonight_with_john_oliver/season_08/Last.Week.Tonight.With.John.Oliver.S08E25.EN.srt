1
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:36,700
WELCOME, WELCOME,

2
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:37,809
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT"!

3
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:38,600
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

4
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:39,366
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.

5
00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:40,366
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF

6
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:41,966
THE WEEK, IN WHICH THE U.S.

7
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:44,245
SURPASSED 700,000 COVID DEATHS,

8
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,841
R. KELLY WAS FOUND GUILTY,

9
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:47,266
AND THERE WAS A GAS CRISIS IN

10
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,766
THE U.K., THANKS TO A

11
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:49,976
COVID-INDUCED SHORTAGE OF TRUCK

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,100
DRIVERS EXACERBATED BY BREXIT.

13
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,666
IT CAUSED MASSIVE PANIC BUYING,

14
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:56,307
BUT ALSO, THIS INCREDIBLE

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,909
I MEAN, THAT IS JUST
EXCELLENT.

16
00:01:17,934 --> 00:01:18,875
TAUNTING PEOPLE WAITING FOR

17
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,633
PETROL IN THEIR STUPID CARS BY

18
00:01:20,004 --> 00:01:22,913
SINGING YOUR HORSE RUNS ON
CARROTS IS OBJECTIVELY

19
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:26,075
HILARIOUS.
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, WHILE, YES,

20
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,533
HORSE OWNERS DON'T NEED PETROL,

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,466
IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT CAR OWNERS

22
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:29,866
DON'T HAVE TO CLEAN UP THEIR

23
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:32,766
VEHICLE'S ENORMOUS SHITS.

24
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,073
SO THE GRASS IS ALWAYS GREENER.

25
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:35,309
BUT LET'S FOCUS ON THE EVENTS IN

26
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:36,433
CONGRESS THIS WEEK.

27
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,576
FOR A START, THE SENATE HELD A

28
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,933
HEARING ON FACEBOOK AND

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,133
INSTAGRAM'S IMPACT ON TEENAGERS'

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,900
MENTAL HEALTH,

31
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:48,566
A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE.

32
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:50,766
BUT ONE THAT PROMPTED THIS

33
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:51,942
REMARKABLE QUESTION POSED BY

34
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:52,866
SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL:

35
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:53,633
WILL YOU COMMIT TO ENDING

36
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,700
FINSTA?

37
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:55,400
SENATOR, AGAIN, LET ME

38
00:01:55,466 --> 00:01:56,833
EXPLAIN, WE DON'T ACTUALLY DO

39
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,966
FINSTA.

40
00:01:58,033 --> 00:01:59,333
WHAT "FINSTA" REFERS TO IS YOUNG

41
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,133
PEOPLE SETTING UP ACCOUNTS WHERE

42
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,700
THEY MAY WANT TO HAVE MORE

43
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:02,766
PRIVACY.

44
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,900
FINSTA IS ONE OF YOUR

45
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:07,800
PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.

46
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:08,400
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT GOOGLE

47
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:09,233
OR APPLE.

48
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,666
IT'S FACEBOOK, CORRECT?

49
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,700
FINSTA IS SLANG FOR A TYPE OF

50
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:17,033
ACCOUNT.

51
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,233
IT'S NOT A PRODUCT.

52
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,566
OKAY, WILL YOU END THAT TYPE

53
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:21,400
OF ACCOUNT?

54
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:22,300
WE... I'M NOT SURE I

55
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:23,766
UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE

56
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,533
ASKING.

57
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,200
YEAH, OF COURSE YOU

58
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:30,400
DON'T.

59
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:31,966
'CAUSE WHAT HE JUST ASKED YOU

60
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:32,666
MADE NO SENSE.

61
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:33,433
AND EVEN BLUMENTHAL'S AIDE SEEMS

62
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,200
AWARE OF THAT, AS HE VISIBLY

63
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:35,309
WINCED IN PAIN IMMEDIATELY AFTER

64
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,033
HEARING IT.

65
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,300
THAT IS THE EXPRESSION OF

66
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:40,442
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THEY'RE GOING

67
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:41,866
TO HAVE TO STAY LATE TONIGHT

68
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:43,093
EXPLAINING TO THEIR BOSS, YET

69
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:44,500
AGAIN, WHAT "FINSTA" IS, BUT

70
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:46,000
ALSO WHAT TWITTER IS AND WHY

71
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:46,600
HE'S CURRENTLY GETTING ROASTED

72
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,166
ON IT.

73
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:52,666
BUT THE REAL DRAMA THIS WEEK

74
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:53,300
CONCERNED THE FATE OF

75
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:53,933
THE BUILD BACK BETTER

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,766
ACT... A KEY PART OF BIDEN'S

77
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:55,600
AGENDA, PROJECTED TO COST

78
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:56,809
$3.5 TRILLION OVER TEN YEARS,

79
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:57,400
WITH DEMOCRATS INTENDING TO PAY

80
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:58,133
FOR IT THROUGH INCREASED TAXES

81
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,833
ON THE WEALTHY.

82
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,909
IT CONTAINS, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

83
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,266
FUNDING FOR AT-HOME CARE,

84
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,100
UNIVERSAL PRE-K, FREE COMMUNITY

85
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,300
COLLEGE, STEPS TO ADDRESS

86
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:07,100
CLIMATE CHANGE, EXPANDED

87
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,276
MEDICARE, AND AN EXTENSION OF

88
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,900
THE CHILD TAX CREDIT... WHICH

89
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:13,233
ALONE IS ESTIMATED TO MEAN

90
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:13,833
4.3 MILLION FEWER CHILDREN IN

91
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,200
POVERTY.

92
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:18,400
IT IS A BIG DEAL AND

93
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:19,466
WOULD MAKE THIS COUNTRY A

94
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,566
BETTER PLACE.

95
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:21,833
BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM.

96
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,600
BECAUSE TO PASS THE BILL,

97
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:23,600
DEMOCRATS ARE USING SOMETHING

98
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:24,233
CALLED "RECONCILIATION" TO EVADE

99
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,442
A FILIBUSTER, WHICH REQUIRES THE

100
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:25,900
SUPPORT OF EVERY SINGLE

101
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:26,800
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR.

102
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:29,033
AND UNFORTUNATELY, MODERATES

103
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,666
LIKE KYRSTEN SINEMA AND

104
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:32,000
JOE MANCHIN ARGUE IT COSTS TOO

105
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:32,600
MUCH.

106
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,733
NOW, TO COUNTER THAT,

107
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,333
PROGRESSIVES HAVE SAID THEY'LL

108
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,100
OPPOSE THE BIPARTISAN

109
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,700
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL... WHICH

110
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:38,966
MANCHIN AND SINEMA WANT...

111
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:39,933
UNLESS THE LARGER BILL IS

112
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,633
GUARANTEED TO PASS ALONGSIDE IT.

113
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,600
AND IF ALL OF THIS

114
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:47,933
SEEMED CHAOTIC,

115
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,700
JEN PSAKI ATTEMPTED TO REASSURE

116
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:49,976
REPORTERS IT WAS ALL PART OF THE

117
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,700
THIS IS WHY WE ALL CAME TO

118
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,500
WASHINGTON.

119
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:52,133
IT'S LIKE AN EPISODE OF A TV

120
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,766
SHOW.

121
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:54,842
UH, WE'RE... WE... I... I'M NOT

122
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:56,300
IN A POSITION TO LOOK IN A

123
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:58,200
CRYSTAL BALL HERE.

124
00:03:58,266 --> 00:03:59,100
WHICH TV SHOW?

125
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,433
MAYBE "THE WEST WING" IF

126
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,366
SOMETHING GOOD HAPPENS, MAYBE

127
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:04,400
"VEEP" IF NOT, I'M NOT SURE.

128
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:05,533
YEAH, OF COURSE YOU

129
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,733
WANT TO BE "THE WEST WING."

130
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,942
EVERY ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO BE

131
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:09,600
"THE WEST WING."

132
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,600
WHY WOULDN'T THEY?

133
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,666
IT'S AMERICAN FAN-FICTION

134
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:13,033
WRITTEN BY A MAN DRUNK ON

135
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:13,566
LIBERAL RIGHTEOUSNESS AND

136
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:16,500
WEAPONS-GRADE COCAINE.

137
00:04:16,566 --> 00:04:17,766
UNFORTUNATELY, THOUGH, THIS

138
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:18,942
WHITE HOUSE MIGHT BE MORE OF A

139
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:19,800
"MR. ROBOT," IN THAT I'M NOT

140
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:24,000
SURE EVEN THE PEOPLE INVOLVED

141
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:25,700
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON,

142
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,266
AND UNLESS THEY'RE CAREFUL, IT

143
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,166
MIGHT STOP AFTER FOUR YEARS.

144
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:34,366
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY THIS, TO

145
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:36,800
BIDEN'S CREDIT, HE SEEMS, SO

146
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:39,466
FAR, TO BE SIDING WITH THE

147
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:40,766
PROGRESSIVES, OR AT THE VERY

148
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:41,366
LEAST, NOT SELLING THEM OUT.

149
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:41,933
WHICH MAKES SENSE... THE BILL

150
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,666
CONTAINS POLICIES HE RAN ON, AND

151
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:43,500
ITS CONTENTS ARE BROADLY

152
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:43,733
POPULAR.

153
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,400
BUT SINEMA AND MANCHIN SEEM

154
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:49,633
UNMOVED.

155
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,233
INJURE HIS CASE, HE WASN'T EVEN

156
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,666
MOVED WITH THOSE MAKING IT IN

157
00:04:55,733 --> 00:05:02,900
PERSON THIS WEEK.

158
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:03,800
PADDLING OUT

159
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:04,400
TO HIS BOAT IN KAYAKS TO HEAR

160
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:04,966
HIM EXPLAIN WHY HE'S HOLDING

161
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:05,833
THINGS UP.

162
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,800
WE WANT TO GET A GOOD BILL

163
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:07,433
THAT'S A BALANCED BILL, THAT'S

164
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,033
WELL DONE.

165
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,466
AND I KNOW IT WON'T BE ENOUGH

166
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:10,100
FOR SOME, IT'LL BE TOO MUCH FOR

167
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:10,533
OTHERS.

168
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,642
IN WEST VIRGINIA, YOU KNOW, WEST

169
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:12,100
VIRGINIA'S A LITTLE BIT

170
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:12,700
DIFFERENT THAN IT USED TO BE.

171
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:13,666
THERE'S A LOT OF POVERTY.

172
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:14,266
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO FOR THE

173
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:14,866
POOR IN WEST VIRGINIA?

174
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:15,500
WE'RE WORKING... WE'RE GOING

175
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:16,133
TO BE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO

176
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,066
CREATE GOOD OPPORTUNITY.

177
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:17,633
WOW.

178
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,233
I'M NOT SURE WHICH STAGE OF

179
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,233
CAPITALISM WE'VE REACHED IF

180
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,233
WE'RE NOW "KAYAKING OUT TO A

181
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,476
POLITICIAN'S YACHT TO BEG HIM TO

182
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,266
HELP THE POOR," BUT IT'S GOTTA

183
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,366
BE ONE OF THE LAST ONES.

184
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:26,233
I'M PRETTY SURE IT GOES OCEAN ON

185
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,966
FIRE, BOOKSTORE BILLIONAIRE

186
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:29,900
LEAVES THE PLANET, THEN

187
00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:34,066
BOAT BITCH SAYS NO, AND THEN

188
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:34,966
IT IS BASICALLY ALL OVER AT THAT

189
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:38,866
POINT.

190
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:39,600
BUT I WILL SAY, AT LEAST

191
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:40,133
MANCHIN'S ACTUALLY

192
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,833
ENGAGING WITH PEOPLE.

193
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,400
KYRSTEN SINEMA HAS BEEN MUCH

194
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,100
MORE EVASIVE.

195
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:42,900
SHE'S MADE A NAME FOR HERSELF AS

196
00:05:42,966 --> 00:05:43,533
TRYING HARD TO BE "THE FUN ONE"

197
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,200
IN THE SENATE, DRESSING HERE

198
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:45,066
LIKE A POWERPUFF GIRL IN WITNESS

199
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:46,866
PROTECTION.

200
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:48,400
BUT IT'S BEEN A LOT LESS FUN

201
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:49,600
THIS WEEK WATCHING HER TURN

202
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:50,533
BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT HER

203
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,800
BARGAINING POSITION INTO A

204
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:54,766
SHITTY GAME.

205
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,200
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO

206
00:05:56,266 --> 00:05:57,509
PROGRESSIVES THAT ARE FRUSTRATED

207
00:05:57,533 --> 00:06:00,333
THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?

208
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,433
I'M IN THE SENATE.

209
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,233
OH, FUCK RIGHT OFF.

210
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,466
AND IT GETS WORSE.

211
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:06,333
WHEN THAT REPORTER ASKED HER A

212
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,066
SECOND TIME, SHE SAID "I'M

213
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:07,666
CLEARLY RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE

214
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:08,400
ELEVATOR."

215
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:09,642
WHICH IS ABOUT AS MADDENING AS

216
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,366
WHEN YOU TELL YOUR DAD "I'M

217
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:11,633
HUNGRY " AND HE SAYS " NICE TO

218
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,166
MEET YOU, HUNGRY.

219
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:15,566
I'M DAD."

220
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:17,800
I MEAN, YEAH, YOU TECHNICALLY

221
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:19,266
"GOT ME" AND YOU CERTAINLY HAVE

222
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,533
A PLAYFUL WAY WITH WORDS, BUT

223
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,500
I'VE GOT A FUCKING PROBLEM THAT

224
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:22,766
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SOLVE.

225
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,000
AND THAT EVASIVENESS MAY HAVE

226
00:06:24,066 --> 00:06:25,000
REACHED ITS PEAK WHEN SHE TOOK

227
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:26,700
OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF

228
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:28,033
NEGOTIATIONS FOR ARIZONA, WHERE

229
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,800
SHE ATTENDED A FUNDRAISER AT A

230
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:29,733
HIGH-END RESORT AND SPA IN

231
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,766
PHOENIX LAST NIGHT.

232
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:34,400
AND AMID ALL OF THE FRUSTRATIONS

233
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:35,609
WITH SINEMA, HER SUPPORTERS HAVE

234
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:36,533
TRIED TO CAST HER ECCENTRICITIES

235
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,400
AS AN ASSET, WITH ONE SAYING,

236
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:42,066
"SHE DOESN'T THINK IN A LINEAR

237
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:42,966
PROCESS, LIKE 'OKAY, WILL THIS

238
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:43,466
IMPACT MY RE-ELECTION?'

239
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:44,166
SHE JUST BEATS HER OWN DRUM.

240
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:45,376
WHEN SHE LEAVES IN THE MIDDLE OF

241
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:45,966
SOMETHING AND SAYS, 'I GOT STUFF

242
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:47,042
TO DO, ' IT'S BECAUSE SHE HAS

243
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:48,400
PLANS.

244
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:50,033
SOMETIMES, SHE'S JUST MORE

245
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:50,833
INTERESTED IN TRAINING FOR AN

246
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,666
IRONMAN.

247
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:55,866
MORE POWER TO HER, MAN."

248
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:57,566
EXCEPT, HERE'S THE THING, NO,

249
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:58,033
NOT MORE POWER TO HER.

250
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,633
BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF HER OWN

251
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,742
SUPPORTERS TELLING YOU SHE'S

252
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:00,700
IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND,

253
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:01,600
DOESN'T THINK IN A LINEAR

254
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:02,433
PROCESS, AND WANDERS OFF IN THE

255
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,966
MIDDLE OF A CONVERSATION.

256
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:06,300
AND IT'S NOT GREAT WHEN A

257
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:08,066
SENATOR'S STRENGTHS ARE HOW I

258
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:10,366
WOULD DESCRIBE ANY CAT.

259
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:12,100
THOSE QUALITIES, IN A CIVILIAN,

260
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,376
MIGHT MAKE YOU A FUN ECCENTRIC,

261
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,033
BUT WHEN YOU'RE A SENATOR, IT

262
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,233
JUST MAKES YOU BAD AT YOUR

263
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,433
FUCKING JOB.

264
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,266
LOOK, THIS BILL COULD MATERIALLY

265
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:23,333
BENEFIT PEOPLE'S LIVES.

266
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,666
AND IF YOU ARE BLOCKING IT, YOU

267
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:25,500
OWE PEOPLE MORE THAN VAGUE

268
00:07:25,566 --> 00:07:26,200
PLATITUDES SHOUTED FROM A BOAT,

269
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:27,633
AND A CUTESY "I'M IN THE SENATE"

270
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,166
COMMENT.

271
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:32,133
BECAUSE IF THESE TWO KEEP THIS

272
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,933
SHIT UP, THEIR WINDOW FOR SAYING

273
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,433
"I'M IN THE SENATE" MAY RAPIDLY

274
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:37,733
BE CLOSING.

275
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,866
AND NOW THIS.

276
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:42,366
AND NOW,

277
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:47,066
NEWSCASTERS TAKE ISSUE WITH THE

278
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:52,866
TERM "LEAF-PEEPING."

279
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:55,333
WE ARE GOING LEAF-PEEPING.

280
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:55,700
LEAF-PEEPING.

281
00:07:55,766 --> 00:08:00,333
A LITTLE CREEPY BE.

282
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,766
LEAF-PEEPING.

283
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,166
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT SOUNDS

284
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:03,733
A LITTLE PERVY.

285
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,766
THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL IT.

286
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:10,366
IT'S WEIRD, RIGHT?

287
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:11,466
A BEAUTIFUL TIME.

288
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,653
I FIND LEAF-PEEPING TO BE

289
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,400
JUST MILDLY DISTURBING.

290
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:17,433
I STILL SAY IT SOUNDS A

291
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,300
LITTLE DIRTY.

292
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:20,833
GET YOUR LEAF-PEEPING ON.

293
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,800
LEAF-PEEPING.

294
00:08:21,866 --> 00:08:23,766
I'VE NEVER SAID THAT BEFORE.

295
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:24,233
FIRST TEN.

296
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,666
IT'S THE TYPE OF PEEPING

297
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:29,666
THAT'S LEGAL.

298
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:30,666
THAT'S...

299
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:31,966
THAT'S THE CREEPIEST THING

300
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,300
I'VE EVER HEARD.

301
00:08:33,366 --> 00:08:34,833
I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYBODY CALL AT

302
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,500
THAT.

303
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:37,266
EXCEPT FOR THE PRODUCER THAT

304
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,400
ROTATES.

305
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:40,233
MOVING ON.

306
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,376
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

307
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:41,600
CHEMICALS.

308
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:42,566
THE SUBSTANCES THAT, ALONG WITH

309
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:43,200
SPAGHETTI, HEINEKEN, AND HUMAN

310
00:08:43,266 --> 00:08:44,166
ARMS, SHOULD NEVER BE KEPT IN A

311
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:46,800
VAT IN YOUR NEIGHBOR'S GARAGE.

312
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:47,566
SPECIFICALLY, WE'RE GOING TO

313
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:48,909
TALK ABOUT A PARTICULAR CLASS OF

314
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:51,400
CHEMICALS CALLED PFAs, WHICH

315
00:08:51,466 --> 00:08:52,666
STANDS FOR "PER- AND

316
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,000
POLYFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES."

317
00:08:54,066 --> 00:09:00,900
THEY GO BY A WIDE VARIETY OF

318
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:06,766
CHEMICAL NAMES LIKE ALL OF THES

319
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,900
THESE, AND ARE USED BY

320
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:09,400
RECOGNIZABLE BRANDS LIKE

321
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,033
GORE-TEX AND TEFLON, AMONG MANY

322
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,700
OTHERS... BUT THE MAIN THING

323
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:11,500
THEY HAVE IN COMMON IS THAT THEY

324
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:12,166
MAKE SURFACES THAT DON'T GET

325
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:12,900
STUFF STUCK TO THEM, WHICH IS

326
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:13,533
SOMETHING A LOT OF US CARE

327
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,333
ABOUT.

328
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,560
ALTHOUGH, ARGUABLY, SOME MORE

329
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:16,466
MISSY!

330
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:17,600
YES, CHEF.

331
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,700
IF YOU SAUTE SCALLOPS IN A

332
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:20,400
NONSTICK PAN, THEY WON'T STICK.

333
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:21,000
THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED FUCKING

334
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:22,000
NON-STICK!

335
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:22,700
I DON'T KNOW WHAT "NON-STICK"

336
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:24,100
MEANS IN TEXAS, SWEETHEART, BUT

337
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,766
FUCK ME.

338
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:26,866
YOU KNOW, AS TEMPTED AS

339
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,633
I AM TO MOCK GORDON RAMSAY, AS A

340
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,233
BRITISH PERSON WHO HAS ALSO

341
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,700
INEXPLICABLY MADE A CAREER OUT

342
00:09:31,766 --> 00:09:32,900
OF SHRIEKING OBSCENITIES AT

343
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:34,333
AMERICANS AND NOT UNDERSTANDING

344
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,233
TEXAS, GAME HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO

345
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,300
RESPECT GAME.

346
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:39,700
AND WHILE I SCREAM, YOU SCREAM,

347
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:41,500
HE SCREAMS, WE ALL SCREAM FOR

348
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:45,666
NON-STICK PANS, THERE'S JUST TWO

349
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:46,433
FIRST, THESE

350
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,266
CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN LINKED TO A

351
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,966
MASSIVE ARRAY OF HEALTH ISSUES.

352
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:49,600
HIGH EXPOSURE TO THESE TWO MAJOR

353
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,700
PFAs ALONE HAVE BEEN LINKED TO

354
00:09:51,766 --> 00:09:52,933
HIGH CHOLESTEROL, ULCERATIVE

355
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,900
COLITIS, PREGNANCY-INDUCED

356
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:56,042
HYPERTENSION, THYROID DISEASE,

357
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:57,533
TESTICULAR AND KIDNEY CANCER,

358
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,266
AND DECREASED RESPONSE TO

359
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,100
VACCINES.

360
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,033
WHICH IS CLEARLY TERRIBLE,

361
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,900
ALTHOUGH ALSO SHOULDN'T BE THAT

362
00:10:03,966 --> 00:10:04,433
SURPRISING, SEEING AS THE

363
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,542
ORIGINAL NAME FOR THIS SHOW WAS

364
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:06,809
"THAT THING YOU LIKE IS BAD WITH

365
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,133
SADDY LONGLEGS."

366
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,700
AND SECOND, PFAs ARE WHAT'S

367
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:12,006
KNOWN AS "FOREVER CHEMICALS"...

368
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:12,900
STUDIES HAVE ESTIMATED THEY HAVE

369
00:10:12,966 --> 00:10:14,200
LIFETIMES IN THE THOUSANDS OF

370
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:16,266
YEARS.

371
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,476
AND THAT COMBINATION OF TOXICITY

372
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,933
AND LONGEVITY IS A REAL PROBLEM,

373
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,266
AS ONE CHEMICAL ENGINEER TRIED

374
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,800
TO EXPLAIN TO CONGRESS A FEW

375
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:24,500
YEARS BACK.

376
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:26,200
IT DOESN'T GO AWAY.

377
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:27,800
THIS IS A MANMADE CHEMICAL.

378
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:29,966
WE JUST PASS THE BATON TO OUR

379
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:32,200
GENERATIONS OF KIDS.

380
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:34,933
IN FACT, IF YOU WERE TO

381
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,266
INCINERATE AND CREMATE ME, I

382
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:37,800
WOULD TECHNICALLY BE A

383
00:10:37,866 --> 00:10:39,900
FLUOROCHEMICAL HAZARDOUS SOURCE.

384
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:41,666
THE TEFLON MESH THAT IS USED IN

385
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:43,433
MY HERNIA PRODUCES A VERY TOXIC

386
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,966
GAS AND DECOMPOSES TO SOMETHING

387
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:47,833
CALLED DEVIL'S PISS, WHICH IS

388
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,400
HYDROFLUORIC ACID.

389
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:52,633
YOU CAN'T KILL THIS BEAST.

390
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,933
YOU CAN ONLY CONTROL IT.

391
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,600
YEAH, THAT DOESN'T

392
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:02,100
SOUND GREAT, DOES IT?

393
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,900
ALSO, IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE

394
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:06,100
THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED

395
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,033
DEVIL'S PISS THAT ISN'T

396
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,566
GORDON RAMSEY'S

397
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,033
VERY REAL LINE OF ALCOHOLIC

398
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,300
SPARKLING WATER,

399
00:11:10,366 --> 00:11:11,800
"HELL'S SELTZER," WHICH YOU CAN

400
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:12,400
APPARENTLY GET IN FLAVORS SUCH

401
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:13,266
AS MEAN GREEN, BERRY INFERNO,

402
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,333
KNICKER TWIST, AND

403
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,133
THAT'S FORKED.

404
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,900
FOR PEOPLE WHO

405
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,566
HATE WATER AND THEMSELVES.

406
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:19,500
BUT THAT MAN IS ABSOLUTELY

407
00:11:19,566 --> 00:11:19,966
RIGHT.

408
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:20,700
TO AN EXTENT YOU MAY NOT

409
00:11:20,766 --> 00:11:22,233
CURRENTLY REALIZE, THE WORLD IS

410
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,700
BASICALLY SOAKED IN THE

411
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,833
DEVIL'S PISS RIGHT NOW.

412
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,333
AND NOT IN A REMOTELY HOT WAY.

413
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,576
SO TONIGHT, WE THOUGHT WE'D TAKE

414
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,300
A LOOK AT JUST HOW BAD THESE

415
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:31,433
SUBSTANCES ARE, HOW LONG SOME OF

416
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,800
THEIR MAJOR MANUFACTURERS KNEW

417
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:33,909
ABOUT IT, AND HOW HARD THIS WILL

418
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:35,333
ALL BE TO FIX.

419
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,900
AND LET'S START BY LOOKING AT

420
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:39,533
ONE OF THE MOST UBIQUITOUS PFAs:

421
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,200
PFOA, ALSO KNOWN AS C8 BECAUSE

422
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:42,533
OF ITS EIGHT CARBON MOLECULES.

423
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,433
3M STARTED SELLING C8 BACK IN

424
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,100
1951 TO THE CHEMICAL GIANT

425
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,533
DuPONT, WHICH THEN USED IT TO

426
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,466
MAKE TEFLON, WHICH IT MARKETED

427
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:53,000
THROUGH ADS LIKE THIS:

428
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:55,266
I USED TO BE A SLAVE TO

429
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:55,966
SCRAPING AND SCRUBBING POTS AND

430
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:57,200
PANS.

431
00:11:57,266 --> 00:11:58,433
BUT I'VE BEEN LIBERATED BY

432
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,366
TEFLON.

433
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:01,466
FOOD DOESN'T STICK TO TEFLON

434
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:02,866
LIKE IT DOES TO OTHER THINGS.

435
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:05,000
SEE?

436
00:12:05,066 --> 00:12:06,333
OKAY, "I USED TO BE A

437
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,700
SLAVE" IS JUST NOT SOMETHING

438
00:12:07,766 --> 00:12:08,966
THAT SHOULD BE COMING OUT OF A

439
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,566
WHITE CHILD'S FACE UNLESS IT'S

440
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:11,933
PINOCCHIO AFTER HE BECOMES A

441
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,466
REAL BOY, AND EVEN THEN, HE'S

442
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,866
STILL NOT "REALLY" FREE, IS HE?

443
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:16,042
HE'S A SLAVE TO SOCIETY AND A

444
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:17,076
PRISONER OF HIS OWN MIND, JUST

445
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,566
LIKE THE REST OF US.

446
00:12:18,633 --> 00:12:20,633
YOUR NOSE MIGHT NOT BE GROWING

447
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,233
ANY MORE, GNOCCHI, BUT MAKE NO

448
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:21,833
MISTAKE... YOU ARE LYING TO

449
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,733
YOURSELF.

450
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,166
BUT THE THING IS, BY THE TIME

451
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:27,666
THAT AD AIRED, 3M AND DuPONT

452
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:28,500
ALREADY KNEW THAT THESE

453
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:30,400
CHEMICALS ACCUMULATED IN HUMANS

454
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:32,233
AND ANIMALS, THAT THEY DIDN'T

455
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,476
DEGRADE IN THE ENVIRONMENT, AND

456
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,000
THAT THEY COULD INCREASE THE

457
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:34,800
SIZE OF THE LIVER IN RATS,

458
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:36,533
RABBITS, AND DOGS.

459
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,800
SO THE WARNING SIGNS WERE VERY

460
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:40,166
MUCH THERE BEFORE THEY HAD A

461
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:41,433
WHITE CHILD SLAVE CLAIM TEFLON

462
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,966
LIBERATED HER FROM THE

463
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:44,533
BACK-BREAKING LABOR OF SCRAPING

464
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,900
MUFFIN TRAYS.

465
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:46,733
AND IN THE DECADES THAT

466
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,533
FOLLOWED, THEY LEARNED EVEN

467
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,583
MORE.

468
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:50,942
IN 1981, 3M FOUND THAT INGESTION

469
00:12:50,966 --> 00:12:52,533
OF PFAs CAUSED BIRTH DEFECTS IN

470
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,533
RATS, AND WHEN THEY TOLD DuPONT

471
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:57,098
ABOUT THIS AND DuPONT THEN

472
00:12:57,123 --> 00:12:59,875
TESTED THE CHILDREN OF EMPLOYEES
IN THEIR TEFLON DIVISION, THEY

473
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,533
FOUND THAT, OF SEVEN BIRTHS, TWO
HAD EYE DEFECTS... INFORMATION

474
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,800
THAT, INTERESTINGLY, DuPONT DID
NOT MAKE PUBLIC.

475
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:08,166
AND BY 1991, IT HAD GOTTEN

476
00:13:08,233 --> 00:13:09,966
UNAMBIGUOUS WARNINGS THAT IT

477
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:13,533
THEN SPECTACULARLY IGNORED.

478
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,166
3M TOLD DuPONT THAT UNDER NO

479
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:16,833
CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU PUT IT

480
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,233
IN WATERWAYS.

481
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:18,933
IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE

482
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,900
DOCUMENT.

483
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,633
DON'T PUT THIS IN THE WATERWAYS.

484
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,500
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, THEY

485
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:27,300
START DUMPING SO MUCH C8 INTO

486
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:28,633
THE WATER THAT THEY, AT ONE

487
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,966
POINT, LOSE TRACK OF HOW MUCH

488
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:31,700
THEY'VE ACTUALLY PUT OUT THERE.

489
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:32,766
WOW.

490
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,766
HARMFUL CHEMICALS ARE NOT

491
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:35,876
SOMETHING YOU SHOULD "LOSE TRACK

492
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,700
OF."

493
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:38,033
THEY'RE NOT YOUR CAR KEYS OR

494
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,033
YOUR MIDDLE CHILD.

495
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,600
OH, OH, I'M SORRY, I LOSE HIM IN

496
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,300
A SUPERMARKET "ONE" TIME AND

497
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:45,866
SUDDENLY "I'M" A BAD PARENT?

498
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:46,433
CALM DOWN.

499
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,333
IT'S NOT LIKE HE WAS GONNA RUN

500
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,333
OUT OF FOOD.

501
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,733
BUT WAIT, IT GETS EVEN WORSE.

502
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,266
TWO YEARS AFTER THAT, IN 1993, A

503
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,533
DuPONT COMPANY MEMO SHOWS THAT

504
00:13:55,566 --> 00:13:57,033
FOR THE FIRST TIME, THEY HAD A

505
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,200
VIABLE CANDIDATE TO REPLACE

506
00:13:59,266 --> 00:14:00,800
C8... ONE THAT APPEARED TO BE

507
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:02,066
LESS TOXIC AND STAYED IN THE

508
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:02,966
BODY FOR A MUCH SHORTER DURATION

509
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:03,366
OF TIME.

510
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:04,476
BUT THE COMPANY DECIDED AGAINST

511
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,666
IT, BECAUSE THE RISK WAS TOO

512
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:08,000
GREAT... SPECIFICALLY, THE RISK

513
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:09,533
TO THEIR BOTTOM LINE, AND THE

514
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,866
FACT THAT TEFLON PRODUCTS WERE

515
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,100
WORTH ROUGHLY A BILLION IN

516
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,661
ANNUAL REVENUE TO THEM, PROVING

517
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:17,100
ONCE AND FOR ALL CORPORATIONS
TRULY ARE PEOPLE...

518
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,308
SPECIFICALLY, SOCIOPATHS.
AND YET DESPITE KNOWING ALL OF

519
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:23,444
THAT, DuPONT KEPT PUSHING FOR
TEFLON TO BE USED IN MORE AND

520
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:27,636
MORE PLACES.
AND IN THIS AD FROM 1994, THEY

521
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,900
BASICALLY PRESENT IT AS BEING
WIZARDRY.

522
00:14:30,966 --> 00:14:33,043
CHEMISTRY IS THE... IS THE

523
00:14:33,068 --> 00:14:36,342
PRACTICE OF MAGIC.
PEOPLE THINK OF TEFLON AND THEY

524
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:39,766
THINK OF FRYING PANS.
TEFLON IS NOT ONE THING.

525
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,266
PUTTING TEFLON ON A SURFACE WILL

526
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:41,933
STOP BUGS FROM CRAWLING UP

527
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,600
TREES.

528
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:43,776
THEY'LL FALL RIGHT OFF THE TREE.

529
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,433
TEFLON IS A CHAIN LOOP, IT'S

530
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,066
SOMETHING I'VE COME UP WITH FOR

531
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:46,966
BICYCLES.

532
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:49,900
YOU KNOW, ONLY DuPONT MAKES

533
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:50,500
TEFLON, BUT YOU CAN USE IT IN

534
00:14:50,566 --> 00:14:51,066
SATELLITES, ON FABRICS, OR

535
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:52,200
LEATHER.

536
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,766
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU HEARD

537
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,109
ABOUT A LEATHER RAINCOAT?

538
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:57,200
YOU CAN LET YOUR IMAGINATION RUN

539
00:14:57,266 --> 00:14:59,964
WILD
IT'S NOT OFTEN YOU GET TO PUT

540
00:14:59,989 --> 00:15:02,008
SOMETHING NEW IN THE WORLD.
OKAY, THERE'S A LOT I

541
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:03,900
DON'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT THAT AD,
INCLUDING WHY IT WAS SHOT BY

542
00:15:03,966 --> 00:15:05,800
SOMEONE WHO'S STILL TESTING OUT

543
00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:07,100
THE ZOOM FUNCTION ON THEIR

544
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,242
CAMCORDER OR WHY THAT INCEL

545
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:09,166
SANTA GIGGLED SO MENACINGLY AT

546
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:10,966
THE IDEA OF A NONSTICK LEATHER

547
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:15,266
RAINCOAT.

548
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,533
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY,

549
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,066
IF THAT'S HIS BAR, IT

550
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:17,666
DOES SEEM PRETTY EASY TO MAKE

551
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:18,633
SOMETHING NEW IN THE WORLD.

552
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,266
LEATHER UMBRELLA,

553
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,100
LEATHER FLOWER, LEATHER SNAKE,

554
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,066
AND LEATHER ELMO.

555
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:22,833
THAT IS FOUR GREAT IDEAS I JUST

556
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,733
CAME UP WITH, AND I'M NOT EVEN A

557
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,666
PhD IN A COSBY SWEATER.

558
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:29,200
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHERE

559
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:30,600
THE EPA WAS IN ALL THIS, YOU

560
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,842
SHOULD KNOW, THEY WERE MORE THAN

561
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:33,933
A LITTLE HAMSTRUNG HERE.

562
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,829
UNDER THE 1976 TOXIC SUBSTANCES

563
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:40,200
CONTROL ACT, THE EPA CAN REQUIRE
TESTING FOR CHEMICALS ONLY WHEN

564
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:41,800
IT'S BEEN PROVIDED EVIDENCE OF

565
00:15:41,866 --> 00:15:43,146
POTENTIAL HARM... A SETUP "WHICH

566
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,833
LARGELY ALLOWS CHEMICAL

567
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,833
COMPANIES TO REGULATE

568
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,833
THEMSELVES."

569
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,833
WHICH IS AN ABSOLUTELY

570
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,020
TERRIFYING SEQUENCE OF WORDS

571
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:52,600
RIGHT UP THERE WITH "INCOMING

572
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,666
FACETIME FROM JEFFREY TOOBIN."

573
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:57,600
NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR THAT.

574
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:58,266
AND EVEN WHEN THE EPA HAS TAKEN

575
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:58,900
STEPS, THEY'VE BEEN PRETTY

576
00:15:58,966 --> 00:15:59,700
LIMITED.

577
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:01,100
FOR INSTANCE, IN 2016, THEY

578
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,442
ISSUED A HEALTH ADVISORY FOR TWO

579
00:16:02,466 --> 00:16:04,033
OF THE BIGGEST PFAs... INCLUDING

580
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,533
C8... SETTING AN "ACCEPTABLE

581
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,400
LEVEL" FOR THEM IN DRINKING

582
00:16:10,466 --> 00:16:11,609
WATER OF 70 PARTS PER TRILLION,

583
00:16:11,633 --> 00:16:12,166
WHICH, INCIDENTALLY, A LOT OF

584
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:13,133
PEOPLE STILL THINK IS TOO HIGH.

585
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,066
BUT ALSO, CRUCIALLY, AN EPA

586
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:15,466
HEALTH ADVISORY IS

587
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:20,733
NON-ENFORCEABLE.

588
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:20,900
ALL

589
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:21,566
AND NO ONE IS GOING TO RESPECT A

590
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:22,133
RULE IF IT'S NOT ENFORCED.

591
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,400
IT'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE SIGNS

592
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:26,200
EVERYONE SEES BUT IGNORES, LIKE

593
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:27,866
"PLEASE TAKE ONE" ON A CANDY

594
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:28,666
BOWL OR "PLEASE, NO SCULPTURE

595
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:29,233
FUCKING" AT MADAME TUSSAUDS.

596
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,100
I'M DOING IT.

597
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,276
I'M TAKING TWO FUN-SIZE SNICKERS

598
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,033
BARS, AND THEN I'M GONNA FUCK

599
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,066
WAX MICHAEL BUBLE.

600
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:35,966
I'M DOING IT.

601
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:36,766
IT'S ALREADY DONE.

602
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,333
GET OVER IT.

603
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,966
AND THAT LAX LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT,

604
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,400
COMBINED WITH DUMPING ON A SCALE

605
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:43,933
SO HIGH THEY "LOSE TRACK" OF IT,

606
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,066
HAS HAD SEVERE CONSEQUENCES.

607
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:47,242
WHEN EPIDEMIOLOGISTS STUDIED THE

608
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:48,309
MEDICAL HISTORY OF PEOPLE WHO

609
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,633
LIVED NEAR A DuPONT PLANT, THEY

610
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,833
FOUND RESIDENTS WITH HIGHER

611
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,333
EXPOSURE TO DRINKING WATER

612
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,000
CONTAMINATED WITH C8 HAD MUCH

613
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:55,433
HIGHER RATES OF KIDNEY AND

614
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,233
TESTICULAR CANCERS.

615
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,633
AND IT WAS EVEN WORSE FOR THE

616
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,033
PEOPLE WORKING INSIDE THE

617
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,276
FACILITIES... AS THIS MAN, WHO

618
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,566
WORKED IN ONE OF DUPONT'S

619
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:08,200
TESTING LABS, AND HAS BEEN

620
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:11,166
DIAGNOSED WITH ULCERATIVE

621
00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:11,800
COLITIS AND RECTAL CANCER, CAN

622
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:12,866
ATTEST.

623
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,500
PEOPLE WOULD HANDLE THAT

624
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:14,266
PRODUCT ON THE JOB, EVERY DAY,

625
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,966
DAY IN, NIGHT OUT, AND THEN WE

626
00:17:17,033 --> 00:17:19,233
WENT TO 12-HOURS SHIFTS,

627
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,900
AT 12 HOURS AT A TIME,

628
00:17:20,966 --> 00:17:21,633
WE HEATED IT AND BREATHED IT

629
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,700
EVERY DAY.

630
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:30,733
KEN WORKED ON A FOUR-MAN TEAM AT

631
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,666
DuPONT'S PLANT TESTING C8

632
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:34,133
BETWEEN 1974 AND 2001.

633
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,833
OF THE FOUR, HE IS THE ONLY ONE

634
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,133
STILL ALIVE.

635
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,033
THE PEOPLE I LOVED, THEY

636
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,533
DIED.

637
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,033
WE WERE LIKE A FAMILY.

638
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,633
LOOK, THAT IS CLEARLY

639
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,200
AWFUL.

640
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:42,866
BUT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO

641
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:43,466
LIVE IN A TOWN WHERE PFAs ARE

642
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:44,433
DUMPED, OR WORK IN A FACTORY

643
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,576
THAT MAKES THEM, TO BE AFFECTED.

644
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,033
REMEMBER, PFAs LAST A LONG TIME,

645
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,433
SO IF THEY SINK INTO THE

646
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,000
GROUNDWATER OR ARE RELEASED INTO

647
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:53,066
THE AIR, THEY CAN TRAVEL.

648
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:54,366
AND THEY CAN BIOACCUMULATE,

649
00:17:54,433 --> 00:17:55,576
MEANING THEY BUILD UP IN YOUR

650
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,733
BODY OVER TIME.

651
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,400
AND THAT BRINGS US TO A SHOCKING

652
00:17:58,466 --> 00:17:59,800
DISCOVERY.

653
00:17:59,866 --> 00:18:01,533
BECAUSE IN THE 1970s, DuPONT

654
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,866
AND 3M STARTED TESTING WORKERS

655
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:04,233
TO CHECK THE LEVELS OF PFAs IN

656
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,100
THEIR BLOOD.

657
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,733
AND 3M WANTED A CONTROL GROUP

658
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,466
WITH "CLEAN BLOOD" SO THEY'D

659
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:10,400
HAVE A BASELINE.

660
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:11,466
BUT AS THIS ENVIRONMENTAL

661
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:12,833
ACTIVIST POINTS OUT, THE COMPANY

662
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,300
QUICKLY REALIZED SOMETHING

663
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:17,966
TRULY HORRIFYING.

664
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:19,233
THERE WAS NO CLEAN BLOOD.

665
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:19,933
THEY TESTED KIDS, THEY TESTED

666
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,500
ADULTS, THEY WENT TO ASIA, THEY

667
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:24,600
WENT ALL OVER THE WORLD AND

668
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,700
EVERYWHERE THEY LOOKED,

669
00:18:25,766 --> 00:18:26,809
PRACTICALLY, THEY FOUND THEIR

670
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,866
CHEMICALS IN PEOPLE'S BLOOD.

671
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:31,533
EVENTUALLY, THEY DID FIND SOME

672
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,766
CLEAN BLOOD.

673
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,433
IT TURNED OUT IT WAS THE BLOOD

674
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,233
THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM ARMY

675
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,580
RECRUITS AND ARCHIVED, SAVED, AT

676
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:43,466
THE START OF THE KOREAN WAR.

677
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:45,133
YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

678
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,100
IN FACT, A CDC STUDY HAS FOUND

679
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,400
THAT C8 IS NOW IN THE BLOOD OF

680
00:18:48,466 --> 00:18:53,766
99.7% OF AMERICANS.

681
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,100
MEANING, AT THE VERY LEAST,

682
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:55,966
VIN DIESEL AND I FINALLY HAVE

683
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:56,466
SOMETHING IN COMMON.

684
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:57,433
EVERY SINGLE THING ABOUT OUR

685
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,500
GENETIC MAKEUP, GENERAL

686
00:18:58,566 --> 00:18:59,833
ATTITUDE, AND VOCAL TIMBRE IS

687
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,633
DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT, BUT WHEN

688
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,966
IT COMES TO TOXIC CHEMICALS IN

689
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:03,566
OUR BLOOD... IT'S POTATO,

690
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:05,866
POTAHTO, MY FRIEND.

691
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:09,433
OR SHOULD I SAY, MY FAMILY.

692
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,900
AND WHILE DuPONT MAY BE A

693
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:11,766
PARTICULARLY STARK EXAMPLE,

694
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:12,466
THEY'RE FAR FROM THE ONLY ENTITY

695
00:19:12,533 --> 00:19:14,266
INVOLVED HERE.

696
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,700
THE MILITARY USES PFAs IN FOAM

697
00:19:15,766 --> 00:19:17,233
TO EXTINGUISH FIRES, SO THEY'VE

698
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,300
BUILT UP AROUND MILITARY BASES.

699
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,900
AND MANY COMPANIES HAVE USED A

700
00:19:20,966 --> 00:19:22,200
LOT OF PFAs IN A LOT OF THEIR

701
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:24,100
PRODUCTS.

702
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,900
FOR INSTANCE, A SHOE COMPANY

703
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:27,500
CALLED WOLVERINE USED PFAs IN

704
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,200
ITS WATERPROOF HUSH PUPPIES.

705
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:31,342
BUT IT WAS ONLY AFTER LOCAL

706
00:19:31,366 --> 00:19:32,700
REPORTING THAT RESIDENTS NEAR

707
00:19:32,766 --> 00:19:33,766
ITS FACTORY IN BELMONT,

708
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:34,913
MICHIGAN, KNEW TO GET THEIR

709
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:36,100
WATER TESTED... AND FOR ONE

710
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,400
FAMILY, THE McNAUGHTONS, THE

711
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:39,133
RESULTS WERE PRETTY STRIKING.

712
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,733
AND BEFORE YOU WATCH THIS,

713
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
THE EPA'S ACCEPTABLE

714
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:44,366
LEVEL IN DRINKING WATER IS

715
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,900
70 PARTS PER TRILLION.

716
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:47,133
THEY LIVED IN THEIR HOUSE

717
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,133
ABOUT THREE YEARS WHEN TOBYN

718
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,966
LEARNED SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH

719
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:51,500
THEIR SON, JACK.

720
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,633
WE WERE REALLY EXCITED.

721
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,566
I WANTED THAT TO GO REALLY WELL,

722
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:56,266
SO I DRANK EIGHT GLASSES OF

723
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,000
WATER A DAY.

724
00:19:57,066 --> 00:19:58,133
I, LIKE, KEPT TRACK.

725
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,566
I ATE REALLY HEALTHY.

726
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:01,642
IN APRIL OF 2016, JACK WAS

727
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,000
BORN.

728
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:04,109
HE HAD AN IMMENSE APPETITE

729
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:08,333
FOR WATER.

730
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,509
HE WAS THIRSTY ALL THE TIME.

731
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:10,733
TEST SHOWED ALMOST 2,000

732
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
PARTS PER TRILLION OF PFAs IN

733
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:16,433
THE MCNAUGHTON'S WATER.

734
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,800
AS SOON AS THEY COULD, TOBYN AND

735
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:19,400
SETH HAD JACK'S BLOOD TESTED.

736
00:20:19,466 --> 00:20:21,133
THE RESULTS... 484,000 PARTS PER

737
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,900
TRILLION, MORE THAN 100 TIMES

738
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:24,833
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.

739
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,100
HE'S THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF

740
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,242
PFAs THAT WE KNOW RIGHT NOW OF

741
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:29,633
ANY CHILD IN THE UNITED STATES.

742
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,366
HE GETS SICK MORE OFTEN AND HIS

743
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:33,766
VACCINATIONS HAVEN'T WORKED.

744
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:34,966
WOW, THAT IS

745
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,500
INCREDIBLE.

746
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:38,133
USUALLY WHEN YOUR CHILD IS THE

747
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,800
HIGHEST IN SOMETHING, YOUR

748
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:40,766
INSTINCT IS TO BRAG ABOUT IT,

749
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:41,909
BUT GOOD LUCK FINDING A BUMPER

750
00:20:41,933 --> 00:20:43,109
STICKER WITH "MY CHILD HAS THE

751
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:44,266
HIGHEST LEVEL OF PFAs IN THE

752
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:49,233
UNITED STATES."

753
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,700
NOBODY WANTS THAT SHIT.

754
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:54,533
AND LOOK, I HAVE TO TELL YOU:

755
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,166
WOLVERINE SAYS IT'S MOVED TO FIX

756
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:55,766
THE PROBLEM FOR HOMEOWNERS IN

757
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,733
THAT AREA, ALTHOUGH YOU SHOULD

758
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,400
KNOW, IT IS JUST NOT A SIMPLE

759
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:01,000
THING TO GO ABOUT DOING.

760
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:02,433
THIS IS WHAT I AFFECTIONATELY

761
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,433
CALL MEGATRON... MY WHOLE HOME

762
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,200
FILTER, THIS RIGHT HERE.

763
00:21:05,266 --> 00:21:07,533
BUT IT GOES THROUGH EACH OF

764
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,366
THESE TANKS... THESE ARE FULL OF

765
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:11,000
GRANULATED CARBON AND IT GOES

766
00:21:11,066 --> 00:21:12,966
THROUGH THEM IN ORDER AND THEN

767
00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:16,900
COMES OUT THIS ONE AND IS CLEAN.

768
00:21:16,966 --> 00:21:18,633
SO EVERY WEEK THEY COME AND TEST

769
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,700
IT AT THE INTAKE AND THEN ALSO

770
00:21:21,766 --> 00:21:23,466
AT THE EXIT SO THAT WE KNOW THAT

771
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:29,266
THE WATER IS EMPTY OF THAT.

772
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,700
OH, GREAT NEWS!

773
00:21:30,766 --> 00:21:31,266
YOU DID IT, WOLVERINE!

774
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:31,966
PROBLEM SOLVED.

775
00:21:32,033 --> 00:21:33,433
ALL IT TAKES IS A FOUR-TANK

776
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,609
SYSTEM AFFECTIONATELY NICKNAMED

777
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:35,833
"MEGATRON," A SPARE ROOM LARGE

778
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,233
ENOUGH TO HOUSE IT, AND A WEEKLY

779
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:37,866
VISIT FROM A TANK TECHNICIAN FOR

780
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:38,800
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

781
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:40,466
WATER PROBLEM?

782
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:41,433
MORE LIKE "WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?"

783
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,033
THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT WORKS.

784
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,000
BUT CLEARLY, A MEGATRON IN EVERY

785
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:47,733
HOME IS NOT A VIABLE SOLUTION

786
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,600
FOR THIS OR, INDEED, ANY

787
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,266
PROBLEM.

788
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,442
AND MAYBE BECAUSE OF THAT... AND

789
00:21:51,466 --> 00:21:52,700
DEFINITELY BECAUSE OF A

790
00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:54,700
COURT-APPROVED SETTLEMENT...

791
00:21:54,766 --> 00:21:55,909
WOLVERINE HAS SINCE GONE TO THE

792
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:57,266
TROUBLE AND EXPENSE OF SWITCHING

793
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,342
THAT WOMAN FROM HER TAINTED WELL

794
00:21:58,366 --> 00:21:59,300
WATER TO THE MUNICIPAL WATER

795
00:21:59,366 --> 00:22:00,666
SUPPLY.

796
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:02,466
AND YET, MANY COMPANIES ARE

797
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:06,966
CONTINUING TO DO THE BARE

798
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:08,466
MINIMUM HERE OR EVEN TRYING TO

799
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:09,266
EVADE RESPONSIBILITY.

800
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,100
DuPONT, FOR INSTANCE, SETTLED A

801
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:10,833
CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT WITH

802
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,933
RESIDENTS OF THE TOWN WHERE IT

803
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,566
WAS DUMPING C8, AND, SHORTLY

804
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:14,400
AFTERWARD, AGREED TO EVENTUALLY

805
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,700
PHASE OUT USING THE CHEMICAL.

806
00:22:16,766 --> 00:22:17,766
WHICH SOUNDS GOOD.

807
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,333
BUT THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT

808
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,033
ASTERISKS ON THAT.

809
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,833
BECAUSE WHILE THEY DID STOP

810
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,333
USING C8, THEY SIMPLY SWITCHED

811
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,766
TO A DIFFERENT KIND OF PFAs,

812
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,066
SOMETHING CALLED "GEN-X,"

813
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:28,400
SPINNING THE MANUFACTURE OF IT

814
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:29,600
OFF INTO A SEPARATE COMPANY,

815
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,000
CHEMOURS.

816
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:32,366
NOW, DID THEY DO THAT SO THAT

817
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:34,066
ANY LEGAL LIABILITY WOULDN'T

818
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:36,000
STICK TO THEM, AND INSTEAD,

819
00:22:36,066 --> 00:22:37,266
SLIDE RIGHT OFF THEM LIKE BUGS

820
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,900
ON A TEFLON TREE?

821
00:22:39,966 --> 00:22:41,766
WHO CAN SAY?

822
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,133
APPARENTLY NOT ME, LEGALLY.

823
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,833
WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT, WHILE

824
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,733
CHEMOURS CLAIMS GEN-X IS SAFER,

825
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,566
SCIENTISTS STILL HAVE

826
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:49,166
SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT ITS

827
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:51,566
PRESENCE IN THE WATER SUPPLY.

828
00:22:51,633 --> 00:22:52,566
THIS IS, IN MY VIEW, MORE OF

829
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:53,642
A RISK THAN WE SHOULD BE FORCED

830
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:55,566
TO TAKE.

831
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:56,676
THIS COMPOUND'S A MEMBER OF A

832
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,200
CLASS OF COMPOUNDS THAT ARE ALL

833
00:22:58,266 --> 00:22:59,566
THOUGHT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

834
00:22:59,633 --> 00:23:02,566
PEOPLE SICK WITH CANCERS OF

835
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:03,366
VARIOUS KINDS, OTHER KINDS OF

836
00:23:03,433 --> 00:23:05,000
DYSFUNCTION.

837
00:23:05,066 --> 00:23:05,833
WE DON'T KNOW THE FULL EXTENT OF

838
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,600
IT.

839
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,000
SO, WITH WHAT THESE

840
00:23:09,066 --> 00:23:09,900
SCIENTISTS DO KNOW, WE ASK THEM

841
00:23:09,966 --> 00:23:11,142
IF THEY THINK THE WATER IS SAFE

842
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:11,866
ENOUGH TO DRINK.

843
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:13,000
NOPE.

844
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:14,000
I DRINK TEQUILA STRAIGHT, BUT I

845
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:20,666
WON'T DRINK THE TAP WATER.

846
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:21,466
WELL, THAT DOESN'T

847
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,733
SOUND GOOD.

848
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,040
IF CASUAL FRIDAY SCIENTIST OVER

849
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:24,633
HERE WON'T DRINK THE TAP WATER,

850
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,300
THERE MIGHT BE SOME CAUSE FOR

851
00:23:25,366 --> 00:23:26,066
ALARM.

852
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:27,000
AND WHILE WE'VE JUST FOCUSED ON

853
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:28,109
A HANDFUL OF INDIVIDUAL PFAs

854
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:29,342
TONIGHT, THERE ARE HUNDREDS, IF

855
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,366
NOT THOUSANDS, OF THEM.

856
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,866
SO THE PROBLEM IS, IF AND WHEN

857
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:33,433
GEN-X IS EVENTUALLY FOUND TO BE

858
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,233
HARMFUL, COMPANIES CAN

859
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,266
PRESUMABLY JUST MOVE ON TO

860
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,233
ANOTHER ONE, THEN ANOTHER ONE,

861
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,146
AND SO ON.

862
00:23:39,171 --> 00:23:40,427
AND SO ON.

863
00:23:40,533 --> 00:23:42,193
AND AT THIS POINT, YOU MIGHT BE

864
00:23:42,266 --> 00:23:44,900
THINKING, "HOLY SHIT, THIS IS

865
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:47,236
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.
SHOULD I START IMMEDIATELY

866
00:23:47,322 --> 00:23:49,108
THROWING AWAY ALL MY PANS?"
WELL, I'LL START WITH THE GOOD

867
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:51,768
MEGHAN McCAIN IS NO
LONGER ON "THE VIEW."

868
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,330
THIS ROCK LOOKS LIKE

869
00:23:53,355 --> 00:23:55,413
COOKIE MONSTER.
AND NO, YOU DON'T NECESSARILY

870
00:23:55,438 --> 00:23:57,571
NEED TO THROW AWAY ALL YOUR
PANS.

871
00:23:57,596 --> 00:23:59,441
EXPERTS SAY THAT IT'S VERY

872
00:23:59,466 --> 00:24:00,866
UNLIKELY PFAs WILL BE RELEASED

873
00:24:00,933 --> 00:24:02,933
IF THE PANS AREN'T OVERHEATED OR

874
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,633
SCRAPED.

875
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,633
NOW, YOU'RE UNDER SLIGHTLY MORE

876
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,333
RISK OF EXPOSURE FROM CLOTHING

877
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,833
THAT CONTAINS PFAs... WHICH IS,

878
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,433
UNFORTUNATELY, MOST STAINPROOF

879
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,433
OR WATERPROOF FABRICS, INCLUDING

880
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,509
CERTAIN ITEMS FROM COMPANIES

881
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:16,433
LIKE LULULEMON, NORTH FACE, AND

882
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,233
PATAGONIA... OR, INDEED, FROM

883
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:23,333
FOOD WRAPPERS THAT CONTAIN PFAs,

884
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,166
WHICH ARE, UNFORTUNATELY, USED

885
00:24:25,233 --> 00:24:26,533
BY MULTIPLE CHAINS, INCLUDING

886
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,066
SOME OF THE PACKAGING AT

887
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:30,176
STARBUCKS, CHICK-FIL-A, AND

888
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,366
SUBWAY.

889
00:24:30,433 --> 00:24:30,966
AND ALL THESE COMPANIES INSIST

890
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:31,966
THEY'RE WORKING TO REMOVE PFAs

891
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:32,566
FROM THEIR PRODUCTS COMPLETELY

892
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:36,033
IN THE COMING MONTHS AND YEARS,

893
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,600
AND I HOPE THAT THAT'S TRUE.

894
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:37,400
BUT WE HAVE HEARD THINGS LIKE

895
00:24:37,466 --> 00:24:39,633
THAT BEFORE, AND YET, HERE WE

896
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,433
FUCKING ARE.

897
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,300
AND IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S EASY TO

898
00:24:41,366 --> 00:24:42,066
KNOW WHICH PRODUCTS YOU'RE

899
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:42,966
BUYING DO AND DON'T CONTAIN

900
00:24:43,033 --> 00:24:44,766
PFAs.

901
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:46,076
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY HAVE TO CARRY

902
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,600
LABELS STATING, "THIS PRODUCT

903
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:49,700
CONTAINS DEVIL'S PISS," ALTHOUGH

904
00:24:49,766 --> 00:24:50,600
THAT'S ACTUALLY A VERY GOOD

905
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:51,742
IDEA, AND THEY SHOULD ABSOLUTELY

906
00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:53,200
HAVE TO DO THAT.

907
00:24:53,266 --> 00:24:54,733
BUT THE BIGGER ISSUE IS, NO

908
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,966
MATTER HOW RESPONSIBLE CONSUMERS

909
00:24:57,033 --> 00:25:01,200
CHOOSE TO BE, IF THE FACTORY

910
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:01,900
THAT MAKES THE CHEMICALS DOESN'T

911
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:02,766
DISPOSE OF ITS WASTE PROPERLY,

912
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:03,733
IT'S LIKELY GETTING INTO YOUR

913
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,600
BLOODSTREAM ANYWAY.

914
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:05,933
WHICH IS PRETTY FRUSTRATING, AS

915
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,120
THE ACTIVIST YOU SAW EARLIER

916
00:25:08,766 --> 00:25:09,500
NO ONE SAID, "HEY, YOU KNOW,

917
00:25:09,566 --> 00:25:11,600
I'M GOOD WITH A LITTLE TEFLON

918
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:13,600
CHEMICAL IN MY BABY'S BLOOD."

919
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:15,433
NO ONE SAID THAT.

920
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,166
THEY SAID, "I LOVE THESE PANS."

921
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:18,366
EXACTLY.

922
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,733
NO ONE LOVES PANS SO MUCH THAT

923
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,433
THEY'D BE WILLING TO PUT POISON

924
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,400
IN THEIR BABY'S BLOOD.

925
00:25:23,466 --> 00:25:25,233
WELL, TO BE HONEST, ONE PERSON

926
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,200
DOES BUT, IN HIS DEFENSE, THE

927
00:25:27,266 --> 00:25:32,066
PANS DON'T FUCKING STICK!

928
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:33,666
NOW, IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT

929
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:36,566
WHAT THE WATER IS LIKE WHERE YOU

930
00:25:36,633 --> 00:25:37,066
LIVE, YOU CAN GO TO THIS

931
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:38,833
ADDRESS,

932
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,633
EWG.org/PFAsMap, AND IF YOU

933
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,300
DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU

934
00:25:40,366 --> 00:25:41,266
SEE, YOU CAN CONSIDER SOLUTIONS

935
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:41,900
LIKE DRINKING BOTTLED WATER, OR

936
00:25:41,966 --> 00:25:48,000
USING A REVERSE OSMOSIS FILTER.

937
00:25:48,066 --> 00:25:49,366
BUT THE TRUTH IS, IT

938
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:50,266
SHOULDN'T JUST BE ON US

939
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:50,766
AS INDIVIDUALS.

940
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:51,700
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, PFAs

941
00:25:51,766 --> 00:25:52,366
SHOULDN'T BE IN MOST CONSUMER

942
00:25:52,433 --> 00:25:52,733
PRODUCTS AT ALL.

943
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,600
AND AS COMPANIES SEEM UNLIKELY

944
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:58,233
TO ALL TAKE THEM OUT

945
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,633
VOLUNTARILY, WE BADLY NEED

946
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,100
LEGISLATION LIMITING THEIR USE

947
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:02,276
TO ONLY ESSENTIAL ITEMS, LIKE

948
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,380
CERTAIN MEDICAL DEVICES AND

949
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:04,133
PROTECTIVE CLOTHING.

950
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,833
BUT NOT JUST THAT... WE NEED TO

951
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,466
CHANGE THE WAY WE REGULATE PFAs

952
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:06,900
COMPLETELY.

953
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:08,466
INSTEAD OF REGULATING THEM ONE

954
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,100
AT A TIME, AS WE DO NOW, WE

955
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:11,176
SHOULD DO IT AS AN ENTIRE CLASS

956
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,966
OF CHEMICALS.

957
00:26:13,033 --> 00:26:14,566
THIS WOULD ENABLE THE EPA TO

958
00:26:14,633 --> 00:26:15,742
MORE EFFECTIVELY REGULATE NOT

959
00:26:15,766 --> 00:26:16,966
JUST THE PFAs ALREADY IN USE,

960
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,313
BUT REPLACEMENTS LIKE GEN-X WHEN

961
00:26:18,366 --> 00:26:20,533
THEY'RE INTRODUCED.

962
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,266
AND IN THE MEANTIME, IF

963
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:23,666
COMPANIES ARE GOING TO KEEP

964
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:25,066
LEANING IN ON THE CONVENIENCE OF

965
00:26:25,133 --> 00:26:26,866
THEIR PRODUCTS WITHOUT

966
00:26:26,933 --> 00:26:28,142
ACKNOWLEDGING THE COST, MAYBE WE

967
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:29,066
CAN HELP THEM, BY PROVIDING

968
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:29,700
THEIR ADS WITH SOME MUCH-NEEDED

969
00:26:29,766 --> 00:26:36,133
CONTEXT.

970
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,376
CHEMISTRY IS THE PRACTICE OF

971
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,900
MAGIC.

972
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:43,533
LIKE ABRACADABRA, ZONKS,

973
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:43,800
WIZARDRY.

974
00:26:43,866 --> 00:26:44,909
PEOPLE THINK OF TO HAVE FUN AND

975
00:26:44,933 --> 00:26:46,833
THEY THINK OF FRYING PANS.

976
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,500
BAKE HOT PLATES WITH SMOOTH LONG

977
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:49,166
STICKS.

978
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:52,900
TEFLON IS NOT ONE THING, IT'S

979
00:26:52,966 --> 00:26:54,133
DISEASE, SICKNESS, AND ITS

980
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,600
FUKCING EVERYWHERE.

981
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:59,066
CUT OUT.

982
00:26:59,133 --> 00:27:00,466
YOU KNOW I'M SELF-CONSCIOUS

983
00:27:00,533 --> 00:27:01,400
ABOUT THE MOUTH.

984
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:02,166
YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT.

985
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:09,900
DID YOU SAY YES OR NO.

986
00:27:09,966 --> 00:27:12,366
PUTTING

987
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:20,000
PFA LS ON THE SURFACE... YOU

988
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:21,400
KNOW I'M SELF-CONSCIOUS ABOUT

989
00:27:21,466 --> 00:27:22,366
THE MOUTH AND EVERYTHING, THE

990
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,166
CLOSE UP STUFF, AND THE

991
00:27:24,233 --> 00:27:24,500
SPITTING?

992
00:27:24,566 --> 00:27:26,733
YOU SAY IT'S GOING TO BE A

993
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
NORMAL SHOOT?

994
00:27:27,866 --> 00:27:31,266
FOCUSING ON...

995
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:33,500
I PUT PFAs ON A BICYCLE CHAIN.

996
00:27:33,566 --> 00:27:33,666
WHY?

997
00:27:33,733 --> 00:27:36,233
BECAUSE I SUFFER FROM CHRONIC

998
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:36,866
INSOMNIA.

999
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:38,000
PROBABLY GOT IT FROM PFAs.

1000
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:39,833
AND THEY ARE EVERYWHERE.

1001
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,666
THE SAME CHEMICALS THAT ARE IN

1002
00:27:40,733 --> 00:27:43,700
ME ARE IN YOU, AND EVEN IN YOUR

1003
00:27:43,766 --> 00:27:44,566
CHILD.

1004
00:27:44,633 --> 00:27:48,266
I PUT SOMETHING IN YOUR CHILD!

1005
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,833
AND IF THIS STUFF GETS INTO

1006
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:56,700
WATER, THAT'S THE REAL

1007
00:27:56,766 --> 00:27:59,233
BIPPETY-BOPPETY MAGIC.

1008
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,133
IT'S INCREDIBLE!

1009
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,466
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HEARD

1010
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:03,800
ABOUT A LEATHER JACKET GIVING

1011
00:28:03,866 --> 00:28:06,866
YOU KIDNEY CANCER?

1012
00:28:07,266 --> 00:28:08,900
YOU CAN LET YOUR IMAGINATION RUN

1013
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:09,100
WILD.

1014
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:11,566
MINE IS RUNNING RIGHT NOW.

1015
00:28:11,633 --> 00:28:12,742
IT'S NOT OFTEN YOU GET TO PUT

1016
00:28:12,766 --> 00:28:14,733
SOMETHING TOXIC IN THE WORLD.

1017
00:28:18,133 --> 00:28:19,633
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

1018
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:21,466
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

1019
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,533
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

1020
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,033
GOOD NIGHT!

1021
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,133
OKAY, OKAY.

1022
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,000
CAN I SAY IT WITH A BRITISH

1023
00:28:30,066 --> 00:28:31,900
ACCENT?

1024
00:28:31,966 --> 00:28:32,900
NO?

1025
00:28:32,966 --> 00:28:34,009
YOU KNOW I'M SELF-CONSCIOUS

1026
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:34,900
ABOUT MY LITTLE MOUTH.

1027
00:28:34,966 --> 00:28:37,100
YOU SAID THIS WOULD BE A NORMAL

1028
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:37,433
SHOOT.

1029
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,300
THAT'S A TERRIBLE BRITISH

1030
00:28:39,366 --> 00:28:41,900
ACCENT, BUT I'LL DO IT ANYWAY.

1031
00:28:41,966 --> 00:28:43,133
YOU KNOW I'M SELF-CONSCIOUS

1032
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,400
ABOUT MY LITTLE MOUTH.

1033
00:28:44,466 --> 00:28:45,466
HE SAID THIS WOULD BE...
