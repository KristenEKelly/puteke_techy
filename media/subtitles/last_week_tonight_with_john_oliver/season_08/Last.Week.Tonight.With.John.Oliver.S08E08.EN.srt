WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

6
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:30,744
STILL COMING TO YOU FROM THIS
BLANK VOID.

7
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:32,462
WHICH I ACTUALLY SHARE WITH THE
PIXAR LAMP.

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,742
IT SAYS IF I TRY TO LEAVE, IT'LL

00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:34,776
CRUSH ME LIKE THE LETTER "I",

AND I CAN'T TELL HOW SCARED

AND/OR HORNY I SHOULD BE.

12
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,566
IT'S BEEN ANOTHER BUSY WEEK.
IN THE U.S., COVID VACCINATIONS

13
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:41,642
ARE RACING AGAINST NEW VARIANTS

14
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,566
OF THE VIRUS.

15
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:44,133
AND IN THE U.K., PRINCE PHILIP

00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:47,866
HIM.

19
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:49,666
AND EVEN IF YOU KNOW A LITTLE

20
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:50,266
ABOUT HIM, YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW

21
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,100
THIS.

22
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,633
TAKE IT BACK TO THE BEGINNING

23
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,633
FOR US, ALASTAIR, AND TELL US

24
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,266

THEN-PRINCESS ELIZABETH.

27
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:03,333
WELL, THEY WERE RELATED.

28
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:06,466
John: YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT,

29
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:07,000
PRINCE PHILIP AND

30
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:08,366
QUEEN ELIZABETH ARE COUSINS WHO

31
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:10,000
LATER GOT MARRIED... ALSO KNOWN

32
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:12,000
AS A "GIULIANI MEET-CUTE."

33
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:16,066
MEANWHILE, THE MATT GAETZ SAGA

34
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:17,833
CONTINUES TO UNFOLD THIS WEEK,

35
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,433
AND NOT IN ANY WAYS THAT LOOK

36
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:18,766
GOOD FOR HIM.

37
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:19,400
THE NEW REPORT OVERNIGHT

38
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:20,900
ALLEGES GAETZ SENT CLOSE

39
00:01:20,966 --> 00:01:22,566
ASSOCIATE AND ACCUSED

40
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:23,566
SEX TRAFFICKER JOEL GREENBERG

41
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:24,676
$900 IN TWO LATE-NIGHT VENMO

42
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,766
TRANSACTIONS IN 2018.

43
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,933
ACCORDING TO THE DAILY BEAST,

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,666
GREENBERG USED THE SAME APP TO

45
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:31,566
SEND THREE YOUNG WOMEN,

46
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,700
INCLUDING ONE WHO HAD RECENTLY

47
00:01:33,766 --> 00:01:34,976
TURNED 18, VARYING SUMS OF MONEY

48
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,333
THAT AMOUNTED TO $900.

49
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:38,366
GREENBERG MADE THE PAYMENTS TO

50
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:39,100
THE THREE YOUNG WOMEN WITH THE

51
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,866
DESCRIPTIONS "TUITION,"

52
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:44,866
"SCHOOL," AND "SCHOOL."

53
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:46,166
John: YOU FUCKING IDIOTS!

54
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:47,242
I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE TO SAY

55
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:53,000
THIS, BUT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO

56
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:55,033
SUSPICIOUS POTENTIALLY CRIMINAL

57
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,933
TRANSACTIONS,

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,900
VENMO IS NOT THE APP TO USE.

59
00:01:56,966 --> 00:01:58,333
VENMO IS FOR ONE THING AND ONE

60
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:58,966
THING ONLY: PASSING JUDGMENT ON

61
00:01:59,033 --> 00:01:59,600
FRIENDS' SPENDING HABITS WHILE

62
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:00,200
OBSESSING OVER WILD FINANCIAL

63
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:00,866
MYSTERIES.

64
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:02,042
WAIT, BRIAN PAID HIS GIRLFRIEND

65
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:02,666
FOR PIZZA?

66
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:03,809
WHY CAN'T KAITLIN JUST LET HIM

67
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:04,733
SLIDE ON THIS?

68
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,300
THEY LIVE TOGETHER, AND IT'S

69
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:06,500
PIZZA.

70
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:07,133
WAIT, KAITLIN'S PAYING BRIAN

71
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,300
NOW?

72
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:09,566
FOR CAKE?

73
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:10,633
BRIAN LIKED IT?

74
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,933
THE FUCK IS GOING ON IN

75
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,333
THIS RELATIONSHIP?

76
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,333
AND LOOK, I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

77
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,166
MATT GAETZ HAS DENIED ALL

78
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:17,333
ACCUSATIONS.

79
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,666
AND I'M SURE THERE WILL BE MORE

80
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:19,742
TO SAY ABOUT ALL THIS WHEN HE

81
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:21,266
GOES TO PRISON.

82
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,633
BUT FOR NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT

83
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,866
IMMIGRATION.

84
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:26,000
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF COVERAGE

85
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:26,933
LATELY ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING ON

86
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,200
THE BORDER, WHICH IS TROUBLING

87
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:28,833
AND COMPLICATED, BUT I'D

88
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,133
ACTUALLY LIKE TO TALK ABOUT

89
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,100
SOMETHING A LOT LESS COMPLICATED

90
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,900
THAT'S ALSO GETTING A LOT LESS

91
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:35,976
COVERAGE, AND THAT IS THE U.S.

92
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,133
REFUGEE ADMISSIONS PROGRAM.

93
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,133
IT'S FOR PEOPLE CURRENTLY ABROAD

94
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,409
FLEEING PERSECUTION OR VIOLENCE

95
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:41,666
WHO'VE APPLIED FOR RESETTLEMENT.

96
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:42,809
AND THE U.S. USED TO BE A WORLD

97
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,300
LEADER IN HOW MANY REFUGEES WE

98
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,366
ACCEPTED, BUT THIS FUCKING GUY

99
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:48,933
NOT ONLY SLASHED THE ADMISSIONS

100
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,160
CAP DOWN TO A HISTORIC ANNUAL

101
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,600
LOW OF 15,000, HE ALSO ADDED

102
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,500
DISCRIMINATORY ELIGIBILITY

103
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:54,866
CATEGORIES THAT HAVE BLOCKED

104
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:56,300
MANY MUSLIM AND AFRICAN REFUGEES

105
00:02:56,366 --> 00:02:58,400
FROM COMING TO THE U.S.

106
00:02:58,466 --> 00:02:59,576
AND TO HIS CREDIT, BIDEN RAN ON

107
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,666
A PLATFORM THAT INCLUDED

108
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:02,742
REVERSING TRUMP'S POLICIES.

109
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,266
AND SINCE TAKING OFFICE, HE'S

110
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,542
BEEN ABOUT AS ELOQUENT AS BIDEN

111
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:07,900
CAN BE ABOUT THE MORAL

112
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:11,200
IMPERATIVE OF DOING SO.

113
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:13,566
COME WITH ME INTO

114
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:14,466
SIERRA LEONE.

115
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:15,633
COME WITH ME INTO PARTS OF

116
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,933
LEBANON.

117
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,533
COME WITH ME AROUND THE WORLD

118
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,833
AND SEE PEOPLE PILED UP IN

119
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,300
CAMPS, KIDS DYING, NO WAY OUT,

120
00:03:22,366 --> 00:03:24,466
REFUGEES FLEEING FROM

121
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:27,066
PERSECUTION.

122
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:28,333
WE, THE UNITED STATES, USED TO

123
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,833
DO OUR PART.

124
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,433
WE WERE PART OF THAT.

125
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,433
WE'RE... AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S,

126
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,233
YOU KNOW... SEND ME YOUR

127
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,300
HUDDLED MASSES.

128
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:40,733
COME ON!

129
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
John: RIGHT, AND UNDERNEATH

130
00:03:42,866 --> 00:03:44,366
THAT PATRIOTIC WORD SALAD IS A

131
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,133
PRETTY GOOD POINT.

132
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,000
EVEN THOUGH HE'S MAKING IT WHILE

133
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:46,633
MANAGING TO SOUND LIKE A GUY IN

134
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,266
A STATUE OF LIBERTY COSTUME IN

135
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,166
TIMES SQUARE.

136
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:49,666
"SEND ME YOUR HUDDLED MASSES.

137
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:49,900
COME ON.

138
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:50,500
I'M BREATHING IN GREEN LEAD

139
00:03:50,566 --> 00:03:51,200
PAINT HERE, SO DO YOU WANT

140
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:52,266
A PICTURE WITH ME AND

141
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,566
BUZZ LIGHTYEAR OR NOT?"

142
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,433
IN EARLY FEBRUARY, BIDEN

143
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,100
ANNOUNCED THAT HE'D RAISE THE

144
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,326
CEILING ON ADMISSIONS TO OVER

145
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:58,600
62,000, ELIMINATE TRUMP'S

146
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,300
RESTRICTIONS, AND RAISE THE CAP

147
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:02,900
EVEN HIGHER NEXT YEAR.

148
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:03,766
WHICH SOUNDS GREAT.

149
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:04,913
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT WAS TWO

150
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:05,866
MONTHS AGO, AND HE STILL HASN'T

151
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:07,133
SIGNED THE PRESIDENTIAL

152
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,276
DETERMINATION THAT WOULD REVISE

153
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,200
TRUMP'S RULES.

154
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:16,300
AND IT HAS BEEN HARD TO GET A

155
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:16,833
STRAIGHT ANSWER FROM THIS

156
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,366
ADMINISTRATION ABOUT WHY.

157
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:18,666
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID THAT

158
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:19,300
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE

159
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:19,700
DONE IMMEDIATELY.

160
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:20,233
WHY DIDN'T HE DO IT TODAY?

161
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,800
I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE MORE

162
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:23,633
AGAIN SOON IN THE COMING DAYS

163
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,666
AND WEEKS ON MORE STEPS AND

164
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:26,633
ACTIONS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS

165
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,633
INTERESTED IN TAKING.

166
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,600
SO I'M JUST NOT GONNA GET AHEAD

167
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,666
OF THAT RIGHT NOW.

168
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:30,600
WHY HASN'T THE PRESIDENT

169
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:31,966
SIGNED THE PAPERWORK TO LIFT

170
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:32,566
THE, THE... RAISE THE REFUGEE

171
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:33,300
CAP?

172
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:34,866
WELL, I WOULD REFER YOU TO

173
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:36,566
THE STATE DEPARTMENT.

174
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:38,100
LAST MONTH, THE PRESIDENT DID

175
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,833
ANNOUNCE THAT HE INTENDED TO

176
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,400
RAISE THE REFUGEE CAP.

177
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:41,966
THAT HASN'T SEEMED TO HAPPEN

178
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:42,133
YET.

179
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,833
WHY HAVEN'T THOSE FLIGHTS

180
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,633
CONTINUED?

181
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,366
HE REMAINS COMMITTED, BUT I

182
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:45,509
DON'T HAVE AN UPDATE ON THE

183
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:46,800
TIMING OF THE FLIGHTS.

184
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:48,400
DOES IT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

185
00:04:48,466 --> 00:04:49,476
WITH THE FACT THAT RESOURCES ARE

186
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,200
GOING TOWARDS THE BORDER AT THIS

187
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:50,533
TIME?

188
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,266
OR...

189
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,633
NO, NO, IT'S NOT RELATED TO

190
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:52,833
THAT.

191
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,566
NO.

192
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:54,809
John: THEN WHAT IS IT RELATED

193
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:58,466
TO?

194
00:04:58,533 --> 00:04:59,766
ALTHOUGH PROPS TO JEN PSAKI,

195
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,800
ONLY A FEW MONTHS INTO THE JOB

196
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:02,400
AND SHE'S ALREADY WAVING AWAY

197
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:05,533
CONCERNS ABOUT STRANDED REFUGEES

198
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,333
WITH THE EASE OF

199
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:06,833
A SPIRIT AIRLINES GATE

200
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,833
AGENT LETTING YOU KNOW YOUR

201
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,233
FLIGHT'S DELAYED.

202
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:08,833
"REST ASSURED, WE'RE COMMITTED

203
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,366
TO GETTING YOU TO ORLANDO

204
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:09,666
EVENTUALLY.

205
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:10,633
WE JUST CAN'T TELL YOU WHERE

206
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,233
YOUR PLANE IS, WHY IT'S TAKING

207
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:11,866
SO LONG, OR WHAT YEAR YOU MIGHT

208
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:12,700
ARRIVE."

209
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:14,066
AND THE THING IS, THERE ARE

210
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:14,966
NEARLY 115,000 REFUGEES IN

211
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:17,066
VARIOUS STAGES OF THE

212
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:19,366
RESETTLEMENT PROCESS RIGHT NOW,

213
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:21,166
WITH MORE THAN 35,000 ALREADY

214
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:23,766
APPROVED FOR RESETTLEMENT HERE.

215
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,000
BUT UNTIL BIDEN SIGNS THAT

216
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:27,200
DETERMINATION, THEY'RE STILL

217
00:05:27,266 --> 00:05:32,033
BEHOLDEN TO TRUMP'S LOW

218
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,733
ADMISSIONS CEILING AND BULLSHIT

219
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:40,200
RACIST RULES.

220
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:42,166
AND MUCH AMONG, MORE THAN 700

221
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:43,333
REFUGEES HAD THEIR FLIGHTS

222
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:43,600
CANCELED.

223
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:44,266
AND REMEMBER, THESE ARE

224
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,200
VULNERABLE PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE

225
00:05:45,266 --> 00:05:45,833
SURRENDERED THEIR BELONGINGS OR

226
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,566
HOMES IN ANTICIPATION OF LEAVING

227
00:05:46,633 --> 00:05:47,433
THE COUNTRY OR WHO ARE WAITING

228
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,033
IN CAMPS.

229
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,109
ALSO, ANY DELAY CAN MEAN THEIR

230
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:49,733
REQUIRED HEALTH OR SECURITY

231
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,600
CHECKS EXPIRE, AND THEY HAVE TO

232
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:51,776
START THE WHOLE PROCESS ALL OVER

233
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,633
AGAIN.

234
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,000
ONE CONGOLESE WOMAN WAS

235
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:56,900
SCHEDULED TO FLY HERE IN EARLY

236
00:05:56,966 --> 00:05:58,300
MARCH BUT HAD HER TICKET

237
00:05:58,366 --> 00:05:59,376
CANCELED, AND BECAUSE SHE'S

238
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,200
PREGNANT AND NOW IN HER THIRD

239
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:02,309
TRIMESTER, SHE CAN NO LONGER

240
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,200
TRAVEL AT ALL.

241
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:06,133
AND BY THE WAY, WHEN HER BABY IS

242
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,000
BORN, THAT CHILD WILL HAVE TO

243
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,533
UNDERGO A SEPARATE SCREENING

244
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,900
PROCESS THAT COULD TAKE MONTHS.

245
00:06:10,966 --> 00:06:15,800
WHICH IS PRETTY WEIRD BECAUSE

246
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:17,300
I'M RELATIVELY SURE YOU CAN'T

247
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:20,466
HAVE FOREIGN ALLEGIANCES BEFORE

248
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:21,433
YOU HAVE OBJECT FUCKING

249
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:21,733
PERMANENCE.

250
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,400
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

251
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:22,966
NOW STUCK IN THIS POINTLESS

252
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:23,466
LIMBO.

253
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:24,266
IT'S AN INFURIATING SITUATION,

254
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:24,933
PERHAPS BEST SUMMED BY THIS

255
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,733
WOMAN, WHO CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY

256
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,566
HER FRIEND... A REFUGEE

257
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:28,200
CURRENTLY STUCK IN A CAMP IN

258
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:29,476
MALAWI, WHO'S BEEN APPROVED FOR

259
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,676
RESETTLEMENT... CAN'T GET ON A

260
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,133
PLANE.

261
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,233
THIS PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN.

262
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,800
WHEN HE CAME, HE SAID THAT HE

263
00:06:37,866 --> 00:06:39,500
WOULD JUST ADD MORE REFUGEES TO

264
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,266
COME TO USA.

265
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,566
AND I HEAR IN THE NEWS THAT

266
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:45,500
THERE IS A PAPER.

267
00:06:45,566 --> 00:06:46,676
I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS A PAPER OR

268
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,633
SOMETHING THAT HE'S SUPPOSED TO

269
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,133
SIGN.

270
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,400
PLEASE, PLEASE, IF HE HEAR MY

271
00:06:52,466 --> 00:06:54,300
VOICE, PLEASE HELP OUR FRIENDS

272
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:55,600
WHO ARE STRUGGLING IN THE

273
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,966
REFUGEE CAMP.

274
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:58,200
John: LOOK, AT LEAST SOME

275
00:06:58,266 --> 00:06:59,400
OF THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR

276
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:00,733
BIDEN... MAYBE RELUCTANTLY...

277
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,633
DID SO ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT

278
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,466
REFUGEES WOULD NOT HAVE TO GO ON

279
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:07,100
CAMERA TO BEG FOR THEIR

280
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,242
ALREADY-APPROVED LOVED ONES TO

281
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:10,400
BE ALLOWED TO COME HERE, BECAUSE

282
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:11,066
THAT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT

283
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:12,333
GOOD GUYS ARE SUPPOSED TO

284
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,509
CHANGE, RIGHT NEXT TO NOT HIRING

285
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,542
THEIR OWN KIDS OR NOT LETTING

286
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:16,033
MIKE LINDELL SWAP OUT THE

287
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,766
PILLOWS IN THE LINCOLN BEDROOM.

288
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,266
AND FOR BIDEN, THIS IS ACTUALLY

289
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,366
REALLY SIMPLE.

290
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:21,542
HE DOESN'T NEED TO NEGOTIATE

291
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,333
WITH REPUBLICANS ON THIS OR

292
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,266
RECKON WITH JOE MANCHIN'S BONER

293
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,366
FOR THE FILIBUSTER.

294
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:26,713
HE JUST NEEDS TO SIGN A PIECE OF

295
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:28,333
PAPER.

296
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,166
AND FOR A GUY WHO CLEARLY WANTED

297
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:31,700
TO BE THE PERSON WHO "RESTORED

298
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:34,466
THE SOUL" OF AMERICA, IT'S PAST

299
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:38,266
TIME FOR HIM TO LOOK DEEP INTO

300
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,409
HIS OWN, PICK UP A FUCKING PEN,

301
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:40,066
AND DO THE RIGHT THING.

302
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:45,100
AND NOW THIS.

303
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,333
Announcer: AND NOW, A

304
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,200
FAREWELL TRIBUTE TO THE GREATEST

305
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:50,033
QUESTIONS EVER ASKED ON

306
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,466
YAHOO! ANSWERS.

307
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:56,066
WHY DO MY BALLS SMELL LIKE

308
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:58,466
HAM?

309
00:07:58,533 --> 00:08:01,000
WHAT'S WRONG ABOUT BEING

310
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:02,242
SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO POKEMON?

311
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:07,500
IS IT TRUE THAT SWEAT IN PEE ARE

312
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:07,833
LIKE COUSINS?

313
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:13,366
WHAT IS THAT ONE MOVIE WHERE

314
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:15,533
LINDSAY LOHAN AND JAMIE LEE

315
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,000
CURTIS SWITCH BODIES?

316
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:20,733
NOT "FREAKY FRIDAY?"

317
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
STD FROM DOUG?

318
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:24,733
IS IT POSSIBLE?

319
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,966
OKAY, WEIRD QUESTION, I SAW A

320
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:27,633
FROG CARRYING ANOTHER FROG ON

321
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:32,533
ITS BACK.

322
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,133
DOES OF ART CONTAIN DNA?

323
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:42,833
HOW IS BABBY FORMED?

324
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,733
John: MOVING ON.

325
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,009
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

326
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:45,733
NURSING HOMES, THE ABSOLUTE LAST

327
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,366
THING YOU WANT ANDREW CUOMO TO

328
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:47,166
BE HANDLING, TIED COMFORTABLY

329
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:48,242
WITH LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE.

330
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:49,466
NURSING HOMES, AND LONG-TERM

331
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:50,576
CARE IN GENERAL, ARE SOMETHING

332
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,966
WE TEND TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT,

333
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,700
BUT THE TRUTH IS, WHETHER DUE TO

334
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:55,700
OLD AGE OR DISABILITY, MANY OF

335
00:08:55,766 --> 00:08:57,533
US DO OR WILL REQUIRE HELP WITH

336
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,433
DAILY LIVING.

337
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,800
THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS 65 AND

338
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:02,833
OLDER IS PROJECTED TO NEARLY

339
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,166
DOUBLE OVER THE NEXT 40 YEARS,

340
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:05,353
AND ONE STUDY ESTIMATED OVER

341
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,733
TWO-THIRDS OF AMERICANS WHO

342
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,100
REACH 65 WILL NEED LONG-TERM

343
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,242
CARE AT SOME POINT IN THEIR

344
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:12,833
LIVES.

345
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,433
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS, FOR THE

346
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,500
RICH, THERE ARE PLENTY OF

347
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:19,733
OPTIONS.

348
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,633
THERE ARE MULTIPLE UPSCALE

349
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,200
RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES WHERE

350
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:21,766
RESIDENTS CAN TRANSITION, IF

351
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,200
NEEDED, INTO FULL-TIME NURSING

352
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:23,800
CARE, LIKE THIS ONE, TOURED IN

353
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:24,466
EXQUISITE FASHION BY 2 CHAINZ:

354
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:24,900
ALL RIGHT.

355
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:26,076
SO THE NAME OF THIS EPISODE IS

356
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,866
CALLED "THE MOST EXPENSIVE

357
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,666
RETIREMENT," RIGHT?

358
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:29,766
AND SO THIS IS THE MOST

359
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,066
UPSCALE, LUXURIOUS RETIREMENT

360
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:31,766
HOME THAT I'VE EVER SEEN AND

361
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,533
EVER HEARD ABOUT.

362
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,533
THE BUILDING ITSELF COST

363
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,000
$100 MILLION TO BUILD.

364
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:37,900
DAMN.

365
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:38,633
THE... THE MARBLE, IT'S FROM

366
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,533
ITALY.

367
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,066
IT'S CUSTOM CARPET.

368
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:42,666
I SEE A LOT OF ART.

369
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:43,833
I SEE THE VERSACE PLATES.

370
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,400
John: OKAY.

371
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:49,666
EXTRAVAGANCE OF THAT PLACE

372
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:50,300
ASIDE, LET'S ALL JUST AGREE:

373
00:09:50,366 --> 00:09:51,300
THAT $195 PLATE SUCKS SHIT.

374
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:52,733
AND I'M NOT NORMALLY A PLATE

375
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,876
GUY... YOUR BOY'S A SAUCER FREAK

376
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,400
FROM WAY BACK.

377
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:55,366
I'M A BOWL BITCH.

378
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:56,609
PLATES AREN'T REALLY MY THING.

379
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:57,833
BUT EVEN I CAN TELL THAT PLATE

380
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,633
IS A 2.

381
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,466
THAT'S A 2 IN OHIO.

382
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,900
IF YOU'RE GONNA SPEND THAT KIND

383
00:10:01,966 --> 00:10:05,433
OF MONEY ON A PLATE, IT BETTER

384
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,033
BE REALLY BIG, REALLY FUN, OR

385
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,666
REALLY, REALLY HOT.

386
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:07,733
THAT PLATE...

387
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,033
LOOK AT ME.

388
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,966
PUT YOUR PHONE DOWN AND LOOK AT

389
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:16,333
ME WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU.

390
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,266
THAT PLATE FUCKS.

391
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,100
BUT THE FACT IS, MOST OF US

392
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,033
AREN'T ENDING UP IN THAT PLACE.

393
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,209
IN FACT, THE VAST MAJORITY OF

394
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:21,800
PEOPLE RECEIVE LONG-TERM CARE AT

395
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:22,733
HOME, AND AROUND 80% OF THAT

396
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,000
CARE IS PROVIDED BY UNPAID

397
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:25,209
CAREGIVERS, OFTEN FAMILY MEMBERS

398
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:26,566
WHO WANT TO KEEP THEIR LOVED

399
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:28,433
ONES OUT OF INSTITUTIONAL CARE,

400
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,700
LIKE THIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER.

401
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:32,433
CHERYL AND KRISTIN ARE AMONG

402
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,400
THE 42 MILLION AMERICANS CARING

403
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:35,706
FOR LOVED ONES AT HOME, AND THE

404
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:37,666
TASKS THEY PERFORM HAVE BECOME

405
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:39,666
INCREASINGLY COMPLEX.

406
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:41,466
WHEN WE HAVE TO FLUSH HIS

407
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:42,900
PICC LINE OR CLEAN HIS PEG TUBE

408
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:44,700
OR TAKE HIS BLOOD GLUCOSE OR HIS

409
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:46,600
BLOOD PRESSURE, YOU KNOW, NONE

410
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,466
OF US WENT TO SCHOOL FOR THAT.

411
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:48,542
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT EDUCATED THAT

412
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:49,366
WAY.

413
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:50,333
I DON'T FEEL LIKE I HAD

414
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,576
ENOUGH TRAINING AT ALL FOR THIS.

415
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,800
WE'VE KIND OF LEARNED BY TRIAL

416
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:53,766
AND ERROR.

417
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:59,466
John: THAT SEEMS REALLY HARD.

418
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,400
AND THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS

419
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:01,000
YOU EXPECT TO DO BY TRIAL AND

420
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:01,533
ERROR... SOLVING A PUZZLE,

421
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,400
LEARNING TO PRONOUNCE THE NAME

422
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:03,066
OF TAMBOURINE SATURDAY, OR

423
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:06,466
CHOOSING A HAIRCUT... FOR THE

424
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:07,609
RECORD, ERROR, ERROR, ERROR, AND

425
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,500
ERROR... BUT PROVIDING ESSENTIAL

426
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:11,400
MEDICAL CARE SHOULD NOT BE ONE

427
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:13,533
OF THOSE THINGS.

428
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,500
TAKING CARE OF SOMEONE AT HOME

429
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:17,733
CAN BE AN INCREDIBLY

430
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,200
COMPLICATED, FULL-TIME JOB

431
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:21,342
THAT IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNPAID.

432
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:24,533
IN FACT, IN TERMS OF LOST WAGES,

433
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,133
THE LABOR OF FAMILY CAREGIVERS

434
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,800
TOTALS ABOUT $67 BILLION

435
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:27,066
ANNUALLY.

436
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:29,466
THAT'S A WORKFORCE THAT, IF IT

437
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:31,733
WERE PAID, WOULD RIVAL THE

438
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,433
ENTIRE GDP OF BULGARIA.

439
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,266
BUT FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T AFFORD

440
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,533
TO EAT OFF UNFUCKABLE PLATES OR

441
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,333
WHOSE LOVED ONES ARE UNABLE TO

442
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,033
HELP THEM AT HOME, MANY WIND UP

443
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,466
IN LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES.

444
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:43,133
THERE ARE TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN

445
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,066
THEM IN THE U.S., AND AS WE'VE

446
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:47,266
SEEN DURING THE COVID CRISIS,

447
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,033
THEY CAN BE FAR FROM IDEAL.

448
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,700
RESIDENTS AND STAFF IN THEM MAKE

449
00:11:50,766 --> 00:11:52,433
UP LESS THAN 1% OF THE

450
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,600
POPULATION, BUT CURRENTLY

451
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,500
ACCOUNT FOR A THIRD OF COVID

452
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:57,200
DEATHS.

453
00:11:57,266 --> 00:11:58,466
THE PANDEMIC PUSHED AN ALREADY

454
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,000
HEAVILY STRAINED SYSTEM TO THE

455
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:02,276
ABSOLUTE BRINK, WITH CONDITIONS

456
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,433
GETTING SO BAD THERE WERE

457
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,066
NEAR-CONSTANT LOCAL NEWS STORIES

458
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:07,933
LIKE THIS:

459
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,533
ONE RESIDENT HERE SAYS HER

460
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,300
CALLS FOR HELP OR IGNORED

461
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,900
BECAUSE THERE WASN'T ENOUGH

462
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:13,300
STAFF TO RESPOND.

463
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:14,666
I'M SCREAMING, "GET ME OUT OF

464
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:15,909
HERE, GET ME OUT OF HERE, GET ME

465
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:16,633
OUT OF THIS THI... "

466
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,533
I WAS SCREAMING AT THEM.

467
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,400
I WAS IN TERRIBLE PAIN, AND THEY

468
00:12:18,466 --> 00:12:18,833
DIDN'T COME FOR ME.

469
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,466
PENNY SHAW WAS IN PAIN AS SHE

470
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:20,033
LAY HELPLESS IN HER BED AT

471
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,466
BRAINTREE MANOR NURSING HOME IN

472
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,866
THE MIDST OF THE COVID-19

473
00:12:23,933 --> 00:12:24,133
PANDEMIC.

474
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,933
SHE BECAME SO DESPERATE SHE EVEN

475
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,833
CALLED BRAINTREE POLICE FOR

476
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,000
HELP.

477
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:30,433
I CAN'T LAY IN BED FOR HOURS

478
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,233
AND HOURS, YOU KNOW, IN PAIN

479
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:36,733
LIKE THAT.

480
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,233
John: I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

481
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,700
WE CONTACTED THAT FACILITY, IT

482
00:12:42,766 --> 00:12:44,933
INSISTED THAT THE SAFETY OF ITS

483
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,166
RESIDENTS IS OF UTMOST

484
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:49,633
IMPORTANCE, BUT THAT IS PRETTY

485
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,433
FUCKING HARD TO BELIEVE WHEN

486
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,133
THEY ARE CALLING THE POLICE FOR

487
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,033
HEALTH.

488
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,766
THEIR ONLY TWO INSTANCES WHERE

489
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:01,133
THAT IS TO BE EXPECTED, AND THAT

490
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,266
IS

491
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,900
IF YOU'RE GIVING BIRTH OR

492
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:04,076
DIGESTING A CRUNCH WRAP SUPREME.

493
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,933
BUT IT'S A LOT MORE UPSETTING

494
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,300
AND THE TRUTH IS, COVID JUST

495
00:13:06,366 --> 00:13:06,866
EXPOSED WHAT WE'VE BASICALLY

496
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:07,533
KNOWN FOR YEARS... THAT THE WAY

497
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,100
THE ELDERLY AND DISABLED ARE

498
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:08,933
TREATED IN FAR TOO MANY OF THESE

499
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,533
FACILITIES IS WITH, AT BEST,

500
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,100
INDIFFERENCE, AND AT WORST,

501
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:11,500
ABUSE AND NEGLECT.

502
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:13,366
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

503
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:14,233
LONG-TERM CARE... HOW THE

504
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,442
INDUSTRY IS STRUCTURED, HOW THAT

505
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:16,900
STRUCTURE CREATES BAD

506
00:13:16,966 --> 00:13:19,600
INCENTIVES, AND WHAT WE CAN DO

507
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:20,666
GOG FORWARD.

508
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,466
AND WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE

509
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:27,400
TWO MAIN TYPES OF LONG-TERM

510
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:28,800
CARE FACILITIES: NURSING HOMES,

511
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:29,766
AND ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES.

512
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:30,333
NURSING HOMES ARE MEDICAL

513
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:30,933
FACILITIES OVERSEEN BY TRAINED

514
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,533
NURSES AND LARGELY STAFFED BY

515
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,866
LOW-PAID NURSING ASSISTANTS.

516
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:35,100
AND THERE HAVE LONG BEEN ISSUES

517
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,433
WITH NURSING HOME CARE... A GAO

518
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,576
REPORT COVERING A FIVE-YEAR

519
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,133
PERIOD BEFORE THE PANDEMIC FOUND

520
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,666
THAT 82% OF HOMES HAD BEEN CITED

521
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:44,033
FOR INFECTION PREVENTION AND

522
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,400
CONTROL DEFICIENCIES, AND ABOUT

523
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:46,900
HALF HAD PERSISTENT PROBLEMS

524
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:48,066
THAT HAD BEEN CITED ACROSS

525
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:49,466
MULTIPLE YEARS.

526
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:51,333
AND A BIG REASON FOR THAT MAY BE

527
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:53,866
BECAUSE UNDERSTAFFING IS A BIG

528
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,633
PROBLEM, WITH EMPLOYEES OFTEN

529
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,733
TASKED WITH TAKING CARE OF WAY

530
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,666
TOO MANY RESIDENTS, AS THESE

531
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:02,266
NURSING ASSISTANTS POINTED OUT

532
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:02,766
JUST LAST YEAR.

533
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:03,766
THEY'RE NOT BEING SHOWERED.

534
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,600
PEOPLE FALLING OUT OF BED.

535
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:07,233
THE MEN AREN'T BEING SHAVED.

536
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,033
PEOPLE FALLEN TO WHERE THEY

537
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,900
FELL OUT OF THEIR WHEELCHAIRS.

538
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:12,433
WHAT IF THEY NEED CHANGED?

539
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,233
THEY MIGHT GET IT ONE TIME.

540
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:13,733
A DAY?

541
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,466
A DAY.

542
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:16,466
WE HAVE 22 RESIDENTS APIECE.

543
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:19,366
MOST DAYS, THAT'S FOR ONE PERSON

544
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:23,900
TO WASH, DRESS, GET UP, TWO

545
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:26,466
MEALS, AND THEY'RE BEING

546
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:27,773
NEGLECTED BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET

547
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:28,633
TO EVERYBODY.

548
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,133
I TOLD THE ADMINISTRATOR, I'M

549
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,566
EMBARRASSED OF MY WORK PROCESS

550
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:38,033
BECAUSE I CAN'T DO WHAT I WAS

551
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,633
TRAINED TO DO ON HOW TO TAKE

552
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,400
CARE OF THESE RESIDENTS.

553
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:42,933
John: THAT IS OBVIOUSLY

554
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,766
UNACCEPTABLE.

555
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:44,333
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW BAD

556
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,133
THINGS NEED TO GET FOR YOU TO

557
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,633
TELL YOUR BOSS YOU'RE

558
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,800
EMBARRASSED BY YOUR WORK?

559
00:14:49,866 --> 00:14:50,600
I'M NOT EVEN EMBARRASSED BY MY

560
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:51,166
WORK, AND JUST THREE MINUTES

561
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:51,733
AGO, I JOKED ABOUT FUCKING A

562
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,766
PLATE.

563
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:54,666
ALSO, THAT WASN'T REALLY A JOKE.

564
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:55,900
CALL ME, WOLF PLATE.

565
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:57,466
AND NURSING ASSISTANTS AREN'T

566
00:14:57,533 --> 00:14:58,900
JUST OVERWORKED... THEY'RE

567
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:00,233
REALLY UNDERPAID.

568
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,566
THE MEDIAN NATIONAL SALARY FOR

569
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:02,900
THAT JOB IS BARELY $30,000 A

570
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:05,000
YEAR.

571
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:06,933
AND ONE REASON IS THAT NEARLY

572
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,433
70% OF NURSING HOMES ARE NOW

573
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,433
FOR-PROFIT INSTITUTIONS.

574
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,400
AND THERE IS A LOT OF PROFIT FOR

575
00:15:13,466 --> 00:15:15,700
THEM TO MAKE, BECAUSE THEY DON'T

576
00:15:15,766 --> 00:15:16,666
PAY STAFF MUCH, BUT THEY CHARGE

577
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:17,766
YOU A LOT.

578
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,533
THE AVERAGE PER-PERSON COST FOR

579
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,666
A PRIVATE ROOM IS $100,000 PER

580
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:24,100
YEAR.

581
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,600
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "YEAH,

582
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:27,900
THAT IS EXPENSIVE, BUT DOESN'T

583
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:28,533
THE MEDICARE PROGRAM I HAVE PAID

584
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,266
INTO ALL MY LIFE COVER THAT?"

585
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,033
WELL, NO, IT DOESN'T.

586
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,242
MEDICARE ONLY FULLY COVERS THE

587
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:33,733
FIRST 20 DAYS OF NURSING HOME

588
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,666
CARE AFTER AN ELIGIBLE HOSPITAL

589
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:37,833
VISIT, THEN PARTIALLY PAYS FOR

590
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,200
UP TO 100 DAYS.

591
00:15:39,266 --> 00:15:44,633
BUT AFTER THAT, YOU ARE ON THE

592
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,366
HOOK FOR ALL COSTS.

593
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:46,266
THE ONLY OTHER WAY TO ACCESS

594
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,033
TAXPAYER HELP TO LIVE IN A

595
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:47,966
NURSING HOME IS TO ALMOST

596
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:49,273
COMPLETELY IMPOVERISH YOURSELF,

597
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,600
TO BASICALLY SPEND YOUR WAY DOWN

598
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:51,742
TO THE POINT YOU QUALIFY FOR

599
00:15:51,766 --> 00:15:53,366
MEDICAID, THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

600
00:15:53,433 --> 00:15:54,766
FOR THE POOR, WHICH, CRUCIALLY,

601
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,833
REIMBURSES NURSING HOMES AT LESS

602
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,000
THAN HALF THE AVERAGE DAILY RATE

603
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:02,866
PAID BY MEDICARE.

604
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:04,133
AND WHILE YOU WOULD LIKE TO

605
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,933
THINK THAT NURSING HOMES WOULD

606
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,133
TREAT ALL PATIENTS THE SAME,

607
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,400
WHETHER THEY'RE ON MEDICARE OR

608
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:09,900
MEDICAID, THE TRUTH IS, YOU

609
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:10,466
MIGHT GET TWO VERY DIFFERENT

610
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:11,333
EXPERIENCES.

611
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,542
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE ON MEDICARE,

612
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:15,200
YOU COULD WIND UP GETTING TOO

613
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,266
MUCH ATTENTION.

614
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,000
JUST LISTEN TO AN ASSISTANT

615
00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:18,433
MANAGER AT ONE NURSING HOME

616
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,000
CHAIN DESCRIBE HOW MEDICARE

617
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:21,366
PATIENTS THERE WERE TREATED.

618
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:22,233
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE

619
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,000
THERAPY THAT YOU WERE BEING TOLD

620
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:23,833
TO ADMINISTER DO YOU THINK WAS

621
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,266
NOT NECESSARY?

622
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,133
I WOULD SAY PROBABLY, AS TIME

623
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,933
WENT ON, ABOUT 40%.

624
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,076
40% OF THE WORK THAT YOU WERE

625
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,966
DOING...

626
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,600
WAS NOT REASONABLE AND NOT

627
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,100
NECESSARY UNDER MEDICARE

628
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,900
GUIDELINES.

629
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:38,600
AT ANOTHER FACILITY, THE ENTIRE

630
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:39,842
REHAB STAFF SIGNED A LETTER TO

631
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,433
THEIR BOSS.

632
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,900
IT READS, "WE HAVE BEEN

633
00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:43,966
ENCOURAGED TO MAXIMIZE

634
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:44,533
REIMBURSEMENT EVEN WHEN

635
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,766
CLINICALLY INAPPROPRIATE."

636
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:49,766
John: THAT IS ABSURD.

637
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:50,400
THE DOJ ACTUALLY FILED A LAWSUIT

638
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:51,033
CLAIMING THAT THE CHAIN THAT

639
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,466
WOMAN WORKED FOR, LIFE CARE

640
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:53,900
CENTERS OF AMERICA... WHICH RUNS

641
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:54,700
OVER 200 NURSING HOMES... WAS

642
00:16:54,766 --> 00:16:55,806
SUBJECTING ITS PATIENTS TO

643
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:57,000
THERAPY EVEN AS THEY WERE ON

644
00:16:57,066 --> 00:17:00,133
THEIR DEATHBEDS.

645
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,000
IT ALLEGED ONE 92-YEAR-OLD WHO

646
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:04,900
WAS DYING OF METASTATIC CANCER

647
00:17:04,966 --> 00:17:06,900
WAS RECORDED AS HAVING HAD

648
00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:08,176
48 MINUTES OF PHYSICAL THERAPY,

649
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,033
47 MINUTES OF OCCUPATIONAL

650
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,000
THERAPY, AND 30 MINUTES OF

651
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:12,666
SPEECH THERAPY, JUST TWO DAYS

652
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:13,933
BEFORE HIS DEATH, ON A DAY HE

653
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,600
WAS SPITTING UP BLOOD.

654
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,133
WHICH IS ABSURD.

655
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,500
RESIDENTS SHOULD BE GETTING

656
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:18,000
PROPER NURSING CARE.

657
00:17:18,066 --> 00:17:19,933
NOT SHIT-TONS OF EXPENSIVE

658
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,866
THERAPEUTIC TREATMENTS THAT ARE

659
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:21,966
CLINICALLY INAPPROPRIATE.

660
00:17:22,033 --> 00:17:23,076
WHICH, BY THE WAY, I'M PRETTY

661
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,566
SURE WAS THE ORIGINAL SLOGAN OF

662
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:25,833
GOOP.

663
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,066
NOW, LIFE CARE DENIED

664
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:29,333
WRONGDOING, BUT AGREED TO PAY

665
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,900
$145 MILLION TO RESOLVE THAT

666
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:35,566
LAWSUIT.

667
00:17:35,633 --> 00:17:36,166
AND THEY'RE HARDLY ALONE HERE.

668
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:37,242
OVER THE PAST DECADE, MULTIPLE

669
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:38,200
OTHER LARGE NURSING HOME CHAINS

670
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,200
HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH

671
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:40,766
FRAUDULENT MEDICARE BILLING

672
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:41,942
PRACTICES AND DENIED WRONGDOING

673
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:43,109
WHILE PAYING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

674
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:44,533
TO SETTLE THEIR CASES.

675
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,400
YOU KNOW, LIKE YOU DO WHEN

676
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:51,433
YOU ARE TOTALLY INNOCENT.

677
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,742
SO TO RECAP HERE: IF MEDICARE IS

678
00:17:52,766 --> 00:17:53,942
PAYING, THE RISK IS, YOU COULD

679
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:54,366
BILLED FOR UNNECESSARY

680
00:17:54,433 --> 00:17:55,200
TREATMENTS.

681
00:17:55,266 --> 00:17:56,276
BUT IF MEDICAID IS PAYING...

682
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,533
WHICH, REMEMBER, REIMBURSES

683
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,866
NURSING HOMES AT LESS THAN HALF

684
00:17:58,933 --> 00:18:00,700
THE AVERAGE DAILY RATE... THINGS

685
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:02,100
COULD GET MUCH WORSE.

686
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,300
BECAUSE IF FACILITIES WANT TO

687
00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:06,666
OPEN UP A BED TO A MORE

688
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:07,666
LUCRATIVE PATIENT, THEY CAN TAKE

689
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:08,633
DRASTIC ACTION.

690
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,400
RONALD, WHO WAS 51 AND

691
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:10,933
HOMELESS, GOT REHAB AT THE

692
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,266
NURSING HOME WHERE HE LIVED FOR

693
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:13,766
MORE THAN A YEAR.

694
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:14,300
THEN ONE NIGHT, AROUND

695
00:18:14,366 --> 00:18:15,466
10:00 P.M., HE SAYS AN

696
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:18,500
ADMINISTRATOR CAME INTO HIS

697
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:18,700
ROOM.

698
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:20,133
BIG SMILE ON THEIR FACE,

699
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,533
SAYING, "WE'RE KICKING YOU OUT."

700
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,000
YEAH.

701
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:26,966
AND THEY JUST BUNDLED ME INTO A

702
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:28,333
VAN AND JUST DROPPED ME OFF HERE

703
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,666
ON THE SIDEWALK.

704
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,133
THE AVALON VILLA CARE CENTER,

705
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,100
THROUGH ITS LAWYERS, TOLD NBC

706
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,100
NEWS IT STRONGLY DISPUTES THAT

707
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:34,966
IT HAS INAPPROPRIATELY

708
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:37,400
DISCHARGED ANY PATIENTS.

709
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:38,900
THE HOMELESS SHELTER WHERE

710
00:18:38,966 --> 00:18:40,666
RONALD IS LIVING NOW SAYS IT'S

711
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:42,700
SEEN CASES LIKE THIS BEFORE.

712
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:45,500
EXPERTS EVEN HAVE A TERM FOR IT:

713
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:46,700
RESIDENT DUMPING.

714
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:47,842
John: OH, COME ON, THAT'S

715
00:18:47,866 --> 00:18:49,133
JUST FUCKING EVIL.

716
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
"RESIDENT DUMPING" IS A

717
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:50,900
COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE

718
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:52,066
PRACTICE.

719
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:53,133
I DON'T EVEN LIKE IT WHEN

720
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,466
RESIDENTS ARE DUMPED ON

721
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,566
"GREY'S ANATOMY."

722
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:57,033
AT THE ALTAR, BURKE?

723
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,666
YOU DUMPED THAT RESIDENT AT THE

724
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:02,633
FUCKING ALTAR?

725
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,433
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO

726
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:06,800
CRISTINA?

727
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:07,666
YOU FUCKING MONSTER!

728
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:09,066
AND YOU'D HOPE REGULATORS WOULD

729
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:10,000
PUNISH NURSING HOMES FOR DOING

730
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:10,400
THINGS LIKE THAT.

731
00:19:10,466 --> 00:19:11,033
BUT THE OVERSIGHT HERE HAS SOME

732
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,733
MASSIVE GAPS.

733
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,400
FOR INSTANCE, THE FEDERAL

734
00:19:12,466 --> 00:19:13,233
GOVERNMENT KEEPS A LIST OF

735
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,366
SO-CALLED "SPECIAL FOCUS

736
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:15,442
FACILITIES"... HOMES THAT HAVE A

737
00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:16,576
PATTERN OF SERIOUS PROBLEMS OVER

738
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,833
A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, AND

739
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,900
THEREFORE RECEIVE EXTRA

740
00:19:18,966 --> 00:19:20,566
INSPECTIONS.

741
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:22,600
THERE ARE 88 NURSING HOMES ON

742
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,266
THAT LIST... BUT INTERESTINGLY,

743
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,933
NOT BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY

744
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,833
88 HOMES THAT DESERVE TO BE, BUT

745
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,266
BECAUSE, DUE TO LIMITED

746
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,233
RESOURCES, THE GOVERNMENT HAS

747
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,966
CAPPED THE LIST AT THAT EXACT

748
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:35,466
NUMBER, DESPITE THE FACT THEY

749
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:36,773
FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE AN ADDITIONAL

750
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:37,733
400 FACILITIES QUALIFY FOR THE

751
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,700
PROGRAM.

752
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:41,133
AND LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING EVERY

753
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,766
LIST SHOULD GO ON FOREVER.

754
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:43,876
IF A LIST OF CUTEST OTTERS WAS

755
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,900
CAPPED AT 88, THAT'D BE A

756
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:46,666
PERFECTLY FINE LIST.

757
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:49,066
BUT IF THERE WERE 400 OTHER CUTE

758
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:50,366
OTTERS THAT WERE ALSO ABUSING

759
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:51,673
THE ELDERLY, I'D REALLY LIKE TO

760
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,500
KNOW WHO ALL OF THEM ARE.

761
00:19:54,566 --> 00:19:56,400
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "WELL,

762
00:19:56,466 --> 00:19:58,466
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

763
00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:00,366
IF I NEED TO MOVE A LOVED ONE

764
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:01,500
INTO A NURSING HOME, I'M

765
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:02,466
DEFINITELY GOING TO LOOK ONLINE

766
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:05,400
AND MAKE SURE IT'S A GOOD ONE,"

767
00:20:05,466 --> 00:20:05,800
WELL, BE CAREFUL.

768
00:20:05,866 --> 00:20:06,986
BECAUSE WHILE THE GOVERNMENT

769
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:07,833
DOES HAVE A WEBSITE WHERE

770
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,500
NURSING HOMES ARE RATED FROM ONE

771
00:20:08,566 --> 00:20:09,733
TO FIVE STARS, IT HAS AN

772
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,633
ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE LOOPHOLE.

773
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,100
OF THE THREE FACTORS THAT

774
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,276
DETERMINE AN OVERALL RATING,

775
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,233
ONLY THE HEALTH INSPECTIONS ARE

776
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,866
CONDUCTED INDEPENDENTLY.

777
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:20,133
THE OTHER STATISTICS, STAFFING

778
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,933
AND QUALITY MEASURES, ARE

779
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,933
SELF-REPORTED BY THE NURSING

780
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,066
HOME.

781
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:26,400
THESE SELF-REPORTED STATISTICS

782
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:27,800
CAN BOOST A THREE-STAR RATING

783
00:20:27,866 --> 00:20:30,833
INTO A FIVE-STAR RATING OVERALL.

784
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,020
THE PROBLEM IS, YOU KNOW,

785
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:34,400
IT'S GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT.

786
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:35,542
SO WHATEVER THEY'RE TELLING THE

787
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:37,633
FEDS, THE FEDS ARE NOT... THAT

788
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,233
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ISN'T GOING

789
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:38,800
IN AND DOUBLE-CHECKING THAT

790
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:39,600
THEIR NUMBERS ARE ACCURATE.

791
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,500
John: YEAH.

792
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:46,266
"GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT."

793
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:46,833
AND THAT IS PATHETIC.

794
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,733
SOMETHING IMPORTANT AS OUR

795
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,466
NURSING HOME RATING SYSTEM

796
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:50,166
SHOULDN'T FOLLOW THE SAME RULE

797
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:50,866
AS EVERY RECIPE ON VELVEETA'S

798
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:54,400
WEBSITE.

799
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:55,733
BECAUSE THERE'S JUST NO WAY ANY

800
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,233
OF THOSE ARE GOOD.

801
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,433
IF YOU'RE MAKING A RECIPE

802
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,133
THAT CALLS FOR A PUDDLE OF

803
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
LORAX JIZZ, THEN DON'T BE

804
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:05,400
SURPRISED WHEN THE FINISHED

805
00:21:05,466 --> 00:21:06,000
PRODUCT IS EQUALLY REPULSIVE.

806
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:06,600
IT'S GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT.

807
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:07,233
SO GIVEN EVERYTHING YOU'VE SEEN,

808
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,700
IT'S HARDLY SURPRISING THAT...

809
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:10,000
FOR REASONS OF COST OR

810
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:11,966
CONDITIONS... MANY MIGHT WANT TO

811
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:13,800
AVOID A NURSING HOME ALTOGETHER.

812
00:21:13,866 --> 00:21:15,166
WHICH BRINGS US TO ASSISTED

813
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:19,066
LIVING FACILITIES, OR ALFs.

814
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:20,066
AROUND A THIRD OF PEOPLE IN

815
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:21,466
LONG-TERM CARE ARE IN ONE OF

816
00:21:21,533 --> 00:21:23,600
THESE, AND THEY DO COST FAR LESS

817
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,500
THAN A NURSING HOME... TYPICALLY

818
00:21:25,566 --> 00:21:27,400
AROUND $50,000 A YEAR.

819
00:21:27,466 --> 00:21:28,133
ALFs STARTED OUT AS AN

820
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,666
ALTERNATIVE FOR THOSE WHO NEEDED

821
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:30,909
HELP WITH KEY ACTIVITIES... LIKE

822
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:31,976
DRESSING, TOILETING, TAKING

823
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,100
MEDICINES AND EATING... BUT ONLY

824
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,342
NEEDED LIMITED MEDICAL SUPPORT.

825
00:21:35,366 --> 00:21:36,700
JUST AS WITH NURSING HOMES, THE

826
00:21:36,766 --> 00:21:38,766
VAST MAJORITY OF ALFs ARE

827
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:42,733
FOR-PROFIT.

828
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,433
BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME KEY

829
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,500
DIFFERENCES.

830
00:21:44,566 --> 00:21:45,966
ALFs ARE LARGELY PAID FOR

831
00:21:46,033 --> 00:21:48,300
OUT-OF-POCKET.

832
00:21:48,366 --> 00:21:49,833
AND THEY ARE FAR LESS REGULATED,

833
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,942
MAKING EASY FOR BASICALLY ANYONE

834
00:21:50,966 --> 00:21:51,700
TO START ONE.

835
00:21:51,766 --> 00:21:55,033
AND I DO MEAN ANYONE.

836
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,633
TAKE STEPHANIE COSTA.

837
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,842
BY 30, SHE OWNED SIX SMALL ALFs

838
00:21:56,866 --> 00:21:57,876
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND HAD

839
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,866
MADE A LOT OF MONEY FROM THEM,

840
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:03,266
ENOUGH TO QUALIFY HER TO

841
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:03,800
APPEAR IN AN EPISODE OF

842
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:04,909
"THE MILLIONAIRE MATCHMAKER."

843
00:22:04,933 --> 00:22:08,300
MY NAME IS STEPHANIE AND I'M

844
00:22:08,366 --> 00:22:09,542
30 YEARS OLD AND I OWN A CHAIN

845
00:22:09,566 --> 00:22:13,200
OF ELDERLY CARE FACILITIES.

846
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:13,900
MY NET WORTH IS $3-4 MILLION,

847
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:18,566
PROBABLY.

848
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:19,300
I'VE ALWAYS HAD THIS THING OF

849
00:22:19,366 --> 00:22:19,900
TAKING CARE OF OLDER PEOPLE.

850
00:22:19,966 --> 00:22:20,900
LIKE SICK, PEOPLE THAT ARE

851
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:21,233
DYING.

852
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:21,966
I'VE ALWAYS REALLY FELT FOR

853
00:22:22,033 --> 00:22:22,800
THEM.

854
00:22:22,866 --> 00:22:24,066
SO I COULDN'T WAIT TO GRADUATE

855
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,900
COLLEGE AND START MY OWN

856
00:22:24,966 --> 00:22:26,166
BUSINESS DOING ASSISTED LIVING

857
00:22:26,233 --> 00:22:27,276
FACILITIES LIKE NURSING HOMES.

858
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,566
John: OKAY.

859
00:22:28,633 --> 00:22:29,966
THERE ARE A LOT OF UNFAIR

860
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:31,142
REASONS THAT I INHERENTLY DON'T

861
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,266
TRUST STEPHANIE COSTA, FROM HER

862
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:34,613
DRIVING A DOUCHEY FERRARI TO THE

863
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:35,700
FACT SHE LOOKS LIKE AN

864
00:22:35,766 --> 00:22:36,966
UNCREDITED EXTRA FROM AN

865
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:38,333
"ENTOURAGE" PARTY SCENE TO THAT

866
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,966
VOICE, WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A MOUSE

867
00:22:39,033 --> 00:22:40,076
WHO WOULDN'T DRESS CINDERELLA

868
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,466
BECAUSE IT HAD BETTER THINGS TO

869
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:44,833
DO.

870
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,333
BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT

871
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,200
GUT FEELING IS ENTIRELY VALID,

872
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:48,533
BECAUSE COSTA TREATED HER

873
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,233
EMPLOYEES AND RESIDENTS SO

874
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,166
TERRIBLY THAT, AFTER MULTIPLE

875
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:51,533
HEALTH AND SAFETY VIOLATIONS,

876
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,100
CALIFORNIA BANNED COSTA FROM THE

877
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,866
INDUSTRY FOR LIFE AND ORDERED

878
00:22:54,933 --> 00:22:58,666
HER AND HER COMPANY TO PAY ABOUT

879
00:22:58,733 --> 00:22:59,800
$1.6 MILLION FOR UNPAID

880
00:22:59,866 --> 00:23:01,266
WAGES AND PENALTIES.

881
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:05,966
BUT IF YOU THINK THAT GAVE HER

882
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:06,666
ACCOUNTABILITY, YOU'RE GOING TO

883
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:07,633
WANT TO THINK AGAIN.

884
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,200
SHE KEPT THIS HOME AFTER

885
00:23:08,266 --> 00:23:08,866
FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY AND

886
00:23:08,933 --> 00:23:09,733
SETTLED WITH WORKERS FOR A

887
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,533
FRACTION OF WHAT SHE OWED.

888
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,133
HER SIX CARE HOMES ARE NOW OWNED

889
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,766
BY A PROPERTY INVESTMENT COMPANY

890
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,866
REGISTERED BY HER FATHER.

891
00:23:15,933 --> 00:23:16,800
John: OH, YEAH.

892
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:17,800
NOT JUST THAT, AS RECENTLY AS

893
00:23:17,866 --> 00:23:19,666
LAST YEAR, SHE WAS STILL LISTED

894
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,100
AS THAT COMPANY'S CEO.

895
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:21,800
SO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

896
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:26,333
REALLY TAUGHT STEPHANIE COSTA A

897
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:26,900
LESSON THERE.

898
00:23:26,966 --> 00:23:28,166
SPECIFICALLY, THE LESSON THAT

899
00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:28,766
YOU CAN TREAT YOUR ELDER CARE

900
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:29,400
WORKERS LIKE ABSOLUTE SHIT,

901
00:23:29,466 --> 00:23:30,266
AVOID ANY REAL CONSEQUENCES, AND

902
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:30,866
JUST KEEP LIVING YOUR LIFE IN

903
00:23:30,933 --> 00:23:32,133
THE SINGLE UGLIEST HOME IN

904
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:32,733
BEVERLY HILLS... ALTHOUGH IT'S

905
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
LEGITIMATELY HARD TO TELL

906
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,966
WHETHER THAT'S ACTUALLY A HOME

907
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:37,433
OR JUST AN ABANDONED

908
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,133
WHITE CASTLE.

909
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,800
BUT IT'S NOT JUST INDIVIDUALS

910
00:23:43,866 --> 00:23:44,466
INVOLVED HERE.

911
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:46,133
THERE ARE ALSO BIG CORPORATIONS

912
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:46,666
RUNNING ALFs, WHO'VE BEEN

913
00:23:46,733 --> 00:23:47,600
WORKING HARD TO FILL BEDS.

914
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:48,466
AND DESPITE THE FACT ALFs ARE

915
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:49,576
SUPPOSED TO BE FOR PEOPLE WHO

916
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,840
REQUIRE LESS MEDICAL ATTENTION,

917
00:23:50,866 --> 00:23:52,200
RECENTLY, SOME HAVE BEEN

918
00:23:52,266 --> 00:24:00,266
AGGRESSIVELY COURTING DEMENTIA

919
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,266
PATIENTS FOR MEMORY CARE

920
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:01,900
PROGRAMS, AS SEEN IN THIS

921
00:24:01,966 --> 00:24:03,009
ADVERTISEMENT FOR BROOKDALE, THE

922
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:03,933
LARGEST ALF PROVIDER IN THE

923
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,633
COUNTRY.

924
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,466
THIS IS A COMPASSIONATE PLACE

925
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:07,100
THAT HELPS FAMILIES THROUGH VERY

926
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:07,733
DIFFICULT STAGES OF DEMENTIA IN

927
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,809
A SAFE AND COMFORTABLE SETTING,

928
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:09,433
AND I HAVE PEACE OF MIND KNOWING

929
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,609
THERE IS A STAFF, FULLY TRAINED,

930
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:11,133
24 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A

931
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,433
WEEK.

932
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,800
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH MY

933
00:24:13,866 --> 00:24:14,333
MOM'S QUALITY OF LIFE HAS

934
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,476
IMPROVED SINCE COMING HERE.

935
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,933
I'M SEEING HER SMILING AND

936
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,266
LAUGHING AGAIN.

937
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,700
WE HELP THEM MAINTAIN THEIR

938
00:24:19,766 --> 00:24:21,033
ABILITIES AND ENCOURAGE THE USE

939
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,500
OF THEIR CURRENT SKILLS IN A

940
00:24:22,566 --> 00:24:26,466
WARM, ENGAGING ENVIRONMENT.

941
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:27,800
THIS IS A SPECIAL PLACE, AND

942
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:28,976
EVERY DAY IS A NEW BEGINNING

943
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,766
WITH LOTS OF SMILES AND

944
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:30,833
MEMORIES.

945
00:24:30,866 --> 00:24:31,733
John: OKAY.

946
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,333
I GET THAT A SENIOR LIVING

947
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,766
COMMERCIAL MIGHT WANT TO HAVE AT

948
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:35,333
LEAST ONE STAFFER WITH THEIR

949
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:35,900
ARMS AROUND A RESIDENT'S

950
00:24:35,966 --> 00:24:36,900
SHOULDERS.

951
00:24:36,966 --> 00:24:37,866
THAT'S KIND OF NICE.

952
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:38,366
TRUSTWORTHY.

953
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:39,433
MAKES YOU FEEL SAFE.

954
00:24:39,466 --> 00:24:40,476
BUT IMMEDIATELY CUTTING TO

955
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,166
ANOTHER ONE FEELS LIKE A BIT

956
00:24:41,233 --> 00:24:42,066
MUCH.

957
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:43,309
AND THEN A THIRD STARTS TO MAKE

958
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,900
ME FEEL A LITTLE NERVOUS.

959
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:45,866
AND WHEN THAT FOURTH HITS, AS A

960
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:46,976
BRITISH PERSON, I'VE GOT TO SAY,

961
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,500
THAT IS JUST TOO MUCH PHYSICAL

962
00:24:48,566 --> 00:24:52,766
CONTACT.

963
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:54,900
THAT SAID, EVEN I'LL ADMIT, AN

964
00:24:54,966 --> 00:24:56,333
ALF THAT OFFERED ALL THAT

965
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,466
COMMERCIAL CLAIMS TO BUT WITH

966
00:24:58,533 --> 00:24:59,133
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS TOUCHING

967
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,600
WOULD BE GREAT.

968
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:00,533
UNFORTUNATELY, A WOMAN WHO

969
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,866
WORKED AT A BROOKDALE FACILITY

970
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:07,100
IN SOUTH CAROLINA PAINTED A VERY

971
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:07,933
DIFFERENT PICTURE OF HOW

972
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,533
STAFFERS ARE TRAINED TO WORK

973
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,366
WITH DEMENTIA PATIENTS.

974
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:10,800
WHEN YOU FIRST START, THEY

975
00:25:10,866 --> 00:25:12,666
HAVE YOU SIT THROUGH A SERIES

976
00:25:12,733 --> 00:25:14,166
OF IN-SERVICES OR ORIENTATION

977
00:25:14,233 --> 00:25:18,500
AND IT LASTS ABOUT A WEEK, BUT

978
00:25:18,566 --> 00:25:19,500
IT'S JUST VIDEO, BUT ONCE

979
00:25:19,566 --> 00:25:20,133
THEY PUT YOU OUT ON THE FLOOR,

980
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,833
THEY DON'T... THEY DON'T GIVE

981
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,633
YOU ANY TRAINING.

982
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:28,233
THEY JUST STICK YOU OUT THERE.

983
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,400
John: WELL, THAT'S NOT REALLY

984
00:25:32,466 --> 00:25:33,666
IDEAL, IS IT?

985
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:34,742
IT'S HARD TO RETAIN IMPORTANT

986
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:35,333
INFORMATION JUST BY WATCHING A

987
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:35,533
VIDEO.

988
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,366
CASE IN POINT: THIS VIDEO.

989
00:25:37,433 --> 00:25:37,733
THINK ABOUT IT.

990
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,876
WHAT HAVE YOU REALLY LEARNED

991
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,100
FROM THIS?

992
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:39,700
SURE, A FEW RANDOM FACTS ABOUT

993
00:25:39,766 --> 00:25:40,366
THE LONG-TERM CARE INDUSTRY THAT

994
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:40,933
YOU'LL PROBABLY IMMEDIATELY

995
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,333
FORGET.

996
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,000
BUT MAINLY, YOU'VE LEARNED THAT

997
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:42,633
IT'S POSSIBLE TO WANT TO FUCK A

998
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,866
PLATE.

999
00:25:45,933 --> 00:25:47,700
AND THAT'S A LESSON YOU WILL

1000
00:25:47,766 --> 00:25:48,033
NEVER FORGET.

1001
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:48,633
AND BROOKDALE INSISTS THAT IT

1002
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,266
OFFERS ONGOING TRAINING FOR ITS

1003
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:50,133
WORKERS AND THAT ITS TRAINING

1004
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,933
PROGRAM FOR DEMENTIA CARE

1005
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,633
WORKERS MEETS OR EXCEEDS STATE

1006
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,233
GUIDELINES.

1007
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:03,200
BUT THAT IS NOT REALLY SAYING

1008
00:26:03,266 --> 00:26:04,700
MUCH, AS SOME STATES ONLY

1009
00:26:04,766 --> 00:26:08,766
REQUIRE TWO TO 30 HOURS, AND

1010
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,166
SOUTH CAROLINA... WHERE THAT

1011
00:26:10,233 --> 00:26:11,466
FACILITY IS LOCATED... HAS NO

1012
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:11,933
STATE MINIMUM AT ALL.

1013
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,633
AND BY THE WAY, IF YOU'RE

1014
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,566
WONDERING ABOUT WHY THERE WERE A

1015
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:14,533
BUNCH OF SHOTS OF A POND IN THAT

1016
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,066
STORY, THE ANSWER IS HORRIFYING.

1017
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:17,309
BECAUSE A 90-YEAR-OLD RESIDENT

1018
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:18,600
THERE, WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

1019
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:20,300
UNDER CONSTANT SUPERVISION

1020
00:26:20,366 --> 00:26:21,666
BEFORE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A

1021
00:26:21,733 --> 00:26:22,900
MEMORY CARE UNIT, DIED AFTER

1022
00:26:22,966 --> 00:26:24,733
LEAVING THE FACILITY UNNOTICED

1023
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,400
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

1024
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:27,666
THERE ARE SIGNS OUT HERE

1025
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:29,066
WARNING PEOPLE ABOUT ALLIGATORS.

1026
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:30,566
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS ONE, IT

1027
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:31,233
SAYS, "ALLIGATORS MAY LIVE HERE,

1028
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,233
BE GATOR SAFE."

1029
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,666
IN THIS CASE, THE SIGNS PROBABLY

1030
00:26:33,733 --> 00:26:34,266
WOULD NOT HAVE MADE A

1031
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:35,100
DIFFERENCE, ACCORDING TO

1032
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:36,300
AUTHORITIES.

1033
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:37,666
WE'RE TOLD THE VICTIM LIKELY

1034
00:26:37,733 --> 00:26:38,533
SLIPPED OR FELL DOWN A STEEP

1035
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,033
EMBANKMENT AND LANDED IN THE

1036
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,433
WATER, ATTRACTING THE GATOR'S

1037
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,633
ATTENTION.

1038
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,133
John: HOLY FUCKING SHIT.

1039
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,533
I HONESTLY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE

1040
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,200
TO BEGIN THERE.

1041
00:26:50,266 --> 00:26:50,833
BUT I GUESS I'D START WITH: WHY

1042
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,566
WOULD ANYONE PUT AN ASSISTED

1043
00:26:51,633 --> 00:26:52,500
LIVING FACILITY NEXT TO A

1044
00:26:52,566 --> 00:26:53,766
FUCKING ALLIGATOR POND?

1045
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,000
THAT SEEMS LIKE THE SORT OF

1046
00:26:55,066 --> 00:26:56,076
DETAIL THAT REALLY HAS TO BE

1047
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,466
INCLUDED AT THE END OF ONE OF

1048
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:00,033
BROOKDALE'S HEARTWARMING ADS.

1049
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,300
THIS IS A SPECIAL PLACE AND

1050
00:27:02,366 --> 00:27:03,233
EVERY DAY IS A NEW BEGINNING

1051
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,633
WITH LOTS OF SMILES AND

1052
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,133
MEMORIES.

1053
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,566
ALSO, ONE OF OUR RESIDENTS

1054
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:09,933
WAS EATEN BY AN ALLIGATOR, SO...

1055
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,733
Y'KNOW...

1056
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,266
THERE'S THAT.

1057
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,866
John: YEAH.

1058
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,433
THERE IS THAT.

1059
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:21,200
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT INFORMATION

1060
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:21,900
FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW, BROOKDALE.

1061
00:27:21,966 --> 00:27:22,566
AND LOOK, OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S AN

1062
00:27:22,633 --> 00:27:23,500
APPALLING STORY.

1063
00:27:23,566 --> 00:27:24,100
BUT TO BE FAIR, IT IS HARD TO

1064
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:24,766
TALK ABOUT LONG-TERM CARE

1065
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:25,466
WITHOUT SHOWING YOU AT LEAST ONE

1066
00:27:25,533 --> 00:27:25,933
OF THOSE.

1067
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,700
JUST BE GRATEFUL I DIDN'T SHOW

1068
00:27:26,766 --> 00:27:27,633
YOU THE STORY WHERE A RESIDENT

1069
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,709
JUMPED FROM A FOURTH-STORY

1070
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:29,633
WINDOW OF AN ALF, OR THE ONE

1071
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,933
ABOUT A NURSING HOME RESIDENT

1072
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,600
WHO SET HERSELF ON FIRE, OR THE

1073
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:35,466
ONE ABOUT A 91-YEAR-OLD

1074
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:36,066
SUFFERING FROM ALZHEIMER'S WHO

1075
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:36,933
FROZE TO DEATH ON CHRISTMAS DAY.

1076
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,800
WHICH, BY THE WAY SOUNDS LIKE A

1077
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:38,533
HOLIDAY ALBUM WRITTEN BY

1078
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,766
FUCKING BJORK.

1079
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:42,600
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

1080
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:44,133
WELL, OBVIOUSLY, INCREASED

1081
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,242
OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT ARE

1082
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:46,733
BADLY NEEDED.

1083
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,600
THAT FACILITY WITH THE

1084
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:49,966
ALLIGATORS WAS EVENTUALLY FINED

1085
00:27:50,033 --> 00:27:51,042
BY THE STATE FOR 11 VIOLATIONS,

1086
00:27:51,066 --> 00:27:52,166
INCLUDING NOT PROPERLY

1087
00:27:52,233 --> 00:27:54,000
PERFORMING NIGHT CHECKS AND

1088
00:27:54,066 --> 00:27:55,109
LETTING STAFFING DROP BELOW

1089
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:57,900
REQUIRED LEVELS, BUT THE PENALTY

1090
00:27:57,966 --> 00:28:00,233
ISSUED WAS JUST $6,400.

1091
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,000
AND IT FEELS LIKE IF YOU LOST A

1092
00:28:02,066 --> 00:28:03,800
LOVED ONE IN SUCH A HORRIFIC

1093
00:28:03,866 --> 00:28:05,600
WAY, YOU'D WANT MORE

1094
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:06,706
ACCOUNTABILITY THAN "DON'T

1095
00:28:06,733 --> 00:28:07,809
WORRY, SOMEONE DECIDED THEIR

1096
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:10,066
LIFE WAS WORTH THE PRICE OF A

1097
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:12,733
2013 CHRYSLER MOTOWN."

1098
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,040
AND THE FACT IS, THERE ARE LOTS

1099
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:14,966
OF IDEAS ON HOW TO FORCE

1100
00:28:15,033 --> 00:28:16,600
FACILITIES TO IMPROVE...

1101
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:18,166
MANDATING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

1102
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:19,242
MONEY HAS TO GO TO PATIENT CARE,

1103
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:20,276
FOR INSTANCE, OR THAT RESIDENTS

1104
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,833
HAVE ACCESS TO A MINIMUM AMOUNT

1105
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,266
OF CARE PER DAY.

1106
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,700
BUT THE BIGGER FIX HERE MIGHT BE

1107
00:28:25,766 --> 00:28:27,133
TO TRY AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR AS

1108
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,466
MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE NOT TO

1109
00:28:28,533 --> 00:28:30,500
END UP IN THESE INSTITUTIONS IN

1110
00:28:30,566 --> 00:28:31,576
THE FIRST PLACE AND INSTEAD

1111
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,533
RECEIVE WHATEVER SUPPORT THEY

1112
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,400
NEED AT HOME.

1113
00:28:35,466 --> 00:28:37,400
NEARLY 90% OF PEOPLE OVER 65

1114
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:38,766
APPARENTLY WANT TO STAY IN THEIR

1115
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:43,866
HOME FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE,

1116
00:28:43,933 --> 00:28:44,600
WHICH DOES MAKE SENSE.

1117
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:45,966
THE PROBLEM IS, RIGHT NOW, MANY

1118
00:28:46,033 --> 00:28:47,733
OF THEM CAN'T, BECAUSE UNDER

1119
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,200
MEDICAID, NURSING HOME CARE IS

1120
00:28:49,266 --> 00:28:50,442
AN ENTITLEMENT... BUT HOME-BASED

1121
00:28:50,466 --> 00:28:53,000
CARE IS NOT.

1122
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:54,766
TO ACCESS LONG-TERM SERVICES AND

1123
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:55,400
SUPPORTS THROUGH MEDICAID IN

1124
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:56,766
YOUR HOME, YOU NEED A WAIVER

1125
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:58,766
FROM YOUR STATE.

1126
00:28:58,833 --> 00:28:59,500
AND TO BE FAIR, SOME, LIKE

1127
00:28:59,566 --> 00:29:02,133
WASHINGTON, DO THAT PRETTY WELL.

1128
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,300
MORE THAN 70% OF THE MEDICAID

1129
00:29:04,366 --> 00:29:05,476
MONEY THEY SPEND ON LONG-TERM

1130
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,676
CARE FOR OLDER PEOPLE AND ADULTS

1131
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,166
WITH DISABILITIES IS SPENT ON

1132
00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:10,000
HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED

1133
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:12,000
SERVICES... THINGS LIKE SKILLED

1134
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:13,733
NURSING VISITS, HOME CARE AIDES

1135
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,200
WHO CAN HELP WITH DAILY TASKS,

1136
00:29:15,266 --> 00:29:16,733
AND EVEN THE ABILITY TO PAY

1137
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,333
FAMILY CAREGIVERS.

1138
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,576
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE LIKE THOSE TWO

1139
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,966
WOMEN YOU SAW EARLIER.

1140
00:29:22,033 --> 00:29:23,700
THE PROBLEM IS, OTHER STATES

1141
00:29:23,766 --> 00:29:26,000
HAVE WAITING LISTS THAT CAN BE

1142
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:27,800
MANY YEARS LONG, BY WHICH POINT,

1143
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,500
SENIORS TRYING TO ACCESS THAT

1144
00:29:29,566 --> 00:29:32,166
CARE CAN BE DEAD, BECAUSE,

1145
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:35,633
SADLY, THAT IS HOW TIME WORKS.

1146
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,200
NATIONWIDE, MORE THAN 800,000

1147
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:38,600
PEOPLE ARE ON THESE KINDS OF

1148
00:29:38,666 --> 00:29:39,933
WAITING LISTS.

1149
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,566
WHAT WE NEED IS REFORM AT A

1150
00:29:41,633 --> 00:29:42,642
NATIONAL LEVEL... AND THERE ARE

1151
00:29:42,666 --> 00:29:46,033
ACTUALLY SOME PROMISING

1152
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,633
DEVELOPMENTS HERE.

1153
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,909
A DISCUSSION DRAFT OF A BILL WAS

1154
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:48,633
RECENTLY INTRODUCED THAT WOULD

1155
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,742
MAKE HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED

1156
00:29:49,766 --> 00:29:50,633
CARE AN ENTITLEMENT UNDER

1157
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,300
MEDICAID.

1158
00:29:52,366 --> 00:29:53,500
AND BIDEN'S PROPOSED

1159
00:29:53,566 --> 00:29:56,100
INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN ACTUALLY

1160
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:57,400
CALLS FOR $400 BILLION TO BE

1161
00:29:57,466 --> 00:29:58,642
SPENT ON THOSE EXACT SERVICES.

1162
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:01,866
AND THAT WOULD BE A BIG DEAL.

1163
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:05,333
AND LOOK, AGGRESSIVE TRANSITION

1164
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,300
TO HOME-BASED CARE IS GOING TO

1165
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:08,633
NEED RIGOROUS GUARDRAILS AND

1166
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,666
OVERSIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT

1167
00:30:10,733 --> 00:30:13,700
MONEY IS NOT MISSPENT, JUST IN A

1168
00:30:13,766 --> 00:30:14,033
DIFFERENT WAY.

1169
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,176
THE LAST THING I WANT IS, FIVE

1170
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,533
YEARS FROM NOW, TO BE HAVING TO

1171
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,000
DO A SHOW ON THE EVILS OF

1172
00:30:19,066 --> 00:30:20,500
NEW FOR-PROFIT HOME CARE

1173
00:30:20,566 --> 00:30:22,000
AGENCIES WHO'VE BEEN DESTROYING

1174
00:30:22,066 --> 00:30:22,566
PEOPLE'S LIVES IN THEIR OWN

1175
00:30:22,633 --> 00:30:22,966
HOMES.

1176
00:30:23,033 --> 00:30:24,600
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "WAIT,

1177
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:25,742
FIVE YEARS FROM NOW YOU'LL STILL

1178
00:30:25,766 --> 00:30:27,466
BE DOING SHOWS IN THE VOID?"

1179
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:28,433
OH, NO.

1180
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,300
WE'LL BE BACK IN THE VOID.

1181
00:30:29,366 --> 00:30:30,600
I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO

1182
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:32,733
SPECIFICS, BUT...

1183
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,833
SPOILER ALERT...

1184
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,942
IT'S NOT A PANDEMIC NEXT TIME!

1185
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:37,166
IT'S SPIDERS.

1186
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:38,533
BUT WE DO NEED TO DO SOMETHING.

1187
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,300
AND IT ALL STARTS WITH SHOWING

1188
00:30:41,366 --> 00:30:42,476
THAT WE GIVE A SHIT ABOUT WHAT

1189
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,433
HAPPENS TO THE ELDERLY AND

1190
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,766
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN THIS

1191
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:48,433
COUNTRY, 'CAUSE RIGHT NOW,

1192
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,576
EVIDENCE POINTS TO THE FACT THAT

1193
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,166
WE ABSOLUTELY DON'T, AND ALL THE

1194
00:30:50,233 --> 00:30:51,000
OTHER PROBLEMS ARE STEMMING FROM

1195
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:52,433
THAT.

1196
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,366
AND THE LONGER WE CONTINUE TO

1197
00:30:54,433 --> 00:30:55,600
IGNORE THIS, THE WORSE IT'S

1198
00:30:55,666 --> 00:30:59,300
GOING TO GET.

1199
00:30:59,366 --> 00:31:00,800
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, RIGHT NOW,

1200
00:31:00,866 --> 00:31:02,133
THIS IS AN INDUSTRY WHERE THE

1201
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,366
PEOPLE IN ITS CARE ARE BEING

1202
00:31:03,433 --> 00:31:04,966
FIGURATIVELY... AND SOMETIMES

1203
00:31:05,033 --> 00:31:05,533
LITERALLY... EATEN ALIVE.

1204
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,433
AND NOW THIS.

1205
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,466
Announcer: AND NOW, A FEW

1206
00:31:13,533 --> 00:31:14,366
MORE OF THE GREATEST QUESTIONS

1207
00:31:14,433 --> 00:31:18,666
EVER ASKED ON YAHOO! ANSWERS.

00:31:18,733 --> 00:31:20,533
HOW DO I GET SPAGHETTI STANDS

1209
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,666
OFF MY UNDERWEAR.

1210
00:31:23,733 --> 00:31:25,966
IS IT OKAY TO GET A TRAMPOLINE

1211
00:31:26,033 --> 00:31:27,433
WET ONCE AND A WHILE?

1212
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:34,833
DOES THE MOVIE "AIR BUD" PAINT

1213
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:39,400
ACCURATE PICTURE OF A DOG'S

1214
00:31:39,466 --> 00:31:39,866
SKILL?

1215
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:42,133
MY DAD IS A GOLF, WHAT DO I DO?

1216
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,866
WHY ARE THE HOLES AND KETCHUP

1217
00:31:44,933 --> 00:31:46,666
ARE ALWAYS IN THE RIGHT PLACES

1218
00:31:46,733 --> 00:31:47,933
FOR THEIR EYES?

1219
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,500
WHY WASN'T I BORN AN OCTOPUS?

1220
00:31:50,566 --> 00:31:54,766
CAN A BIRD STAY ON A CLOUD?

1221
00:31:54,833 --> 00:32:02,833
HOW DO I FIX MY FARTING PENIS?

1222
00:32:05,266 --> 00:32:06,566

HOW DO I TURN OFF MY CAPS LOCK?

1224
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:11,300
John: THAT'S OUR SHOW,
