1
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:34,233
WELCOME, WELCOME,

2
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,100
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

3
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:35,833
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

4
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:36,500
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

5
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:39,033
US.

6
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,300
WE'RE BACK... BOTH IN A STUDIO

7
00:00:41,366 --> 00:00:44,233
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 18 MONTHS,

8
00:00:44,258 --> 00:00:47,256
AND WITH A NEW SET AND A SMALL,
VACCINATED, MASKED AUDIENCE, ONE

9
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:50,803
OF WHOM, AND I'M NOT SAYING WHO,
HAS A BREAKTHROUGH CASE.

10
00:00:50,828 --> 00:00:53,444
NOT OF COVID, THOUGH!

11
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:56,294
RELAX!
OF SMALLPOX.

12
00:00:56,319 --> 00:00:58,795
SO IT'S COMPLETELY FINE.

13
00:00:58,928 --> 00:01:00,538
AND WE'RE GOING TO DIVE STRAIGHT

14
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,163
IN TONIGHT WITH TEXAS, A STATE

15
00:01:02,256 --> 00:01:04,006
SO BIG IT HAS THREE OFFICIAL

16
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,733
STATE MAMMALS, TWO OF WHICH CAN

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,566
GO FUCK THEMSELVES, AND EXACTLY

18
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:10,466
ONE OF WHICH IS THE ARMADILLO.

19
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:11,266
WHICH IS THE PERFECT ANIMAL.

20
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:11,933
FOR STARTERS, IT LOOKS LIKE A

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,500
POSSUM WHO WORKS AT MEDIEVAL

22
00:01:12,566 --> 00:01:13,766
TIMES.

23
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,300
PLUS, ARMADILLOS CAN ROLL UP IN

24
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:18,400
A BALL WHEN THEY'RE SCARED.

25
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:20,433
PLUS, THEY SLEEP FOR 16 HOURS A

26
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,233
DAY WHICH, RELATABLE, AND SOME

27
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:22,833
SCREAM LIKE THIS TO SCARE OFF

28
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:30,900
PREDATORS.

29
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:35,766
GOOD BOY, YOU TELL THEM.

30
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:37,042
SADLY, THOUGH, TONIGHT CAN'T BE

31
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:37,900
ALL FUN ARMADILLO FACTS, BECAUSE

32
00:01:37,966 --> 00:01:39,206
TEXAS IS CURRENTLY REELING FROM

33
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:40,000
AN INCREDIBLY DRACONIAN NEW

34
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,433
ABORTION LAW.

35
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,966
ABORTION PROVIDERS IN TEXAS

36
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:45,600
HAVE STARTED TURNING AWAY

37
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:46,200
PATIENTS AS THE STATE'S NEW

38
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:47,133
ABORTION LAW TOOK EFFECT AT

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,166
MIDNIGHT.

40
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:50,276
THE TEXAS LAW BANS ABORTION

41
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,066
AFTER ABOUT SIX WEEKS OF

42
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:53,233
PREGNANCY WHEN A SO-CALLED

43
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,333
"FETAL HEARTBEAT" IS DETECTED.

44
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,900
A CONTROVERSIAL TERM BECAUSE OF

45
00:01:56,966 --> 00:01:59,300
HOW UNDEVELOPED THE EMBRYO IS AT

46
00:01:59,366 --> 00:01:59,900
THAT STAGE.

47
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:01,076
THE LAW MAKES NO EXCEPTION FOR

48
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,833
RAPE OR INCEST.

49
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,009
THE NEW TEXAS LAW DOES NOT

50
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:04,933
ALLOW STATE OFFICIALS TO ENFORCE

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,433
THE BAN.

52
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,833
INSTEAD, IT LETS PRIVATE

53
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,400
CITIZENS SUE ANYONE WHO HELPED A

54
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:11,933
WOMAN VIOLATE THE LAW FOR

55
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:16,200
$10,000.

56
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:16,733
YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

57
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,300
PRIVATE CITIZENS CAN NOW SUE

58
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:18,266
OTHERS FOR AIDING IN AN

59
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,200
ABORTION, WHETHER THEY'RE A

60
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:21,133
DOCTOR, A CLINIC WORKER, OR EVEN

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,066
AN UBER DRIVER WHO TOOK SOMEONE

62
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:23,633
TO THE CLINIC.

63
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,133
MEANING THIS LAW HAS SOMEHOW

64
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,066
MANAGED TO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE,

65
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:27,033
AND MAKE BEING AN UBER DRIVER

66
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,033
EVEN WORSE.

67
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,333
"HEY, YOU DON'T GET HEALTH

68
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,600
INSURANCE, PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE

69
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:32,709
ASSHOLES TO YOU, AND NOW YOU

70
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:33,533
MIGHT ALSO HAVE A CASH BOUNTY ON

71
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,766
YOUR HEAD.

72
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:35,566
NOW GET OUT THERE AND BEG FOR

73
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:38,300
STARS."

74
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,800
AFTER THE LAW WENT INTO EFFECT

75
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:41,109
LAST WEEK, THE SUPREME COURT, IN

76
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:42,700
A MAJOR STEP, TOOK A PASS ON

77
00:02:42,766 --> 00:02:43,809
INTERVENING... SOMETHING THAT

78
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,600
WAS SUCH A HUGE PIECE OF NEWS,

79
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,033
EVEN TMZ HAD TO WEIGH IN.

80
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,176
THE SUPREME COURT COULD HAVE

81
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,933
BLOCKED THIS.

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,533
BECAUSE IF ANY LAW SEEMS COUNTER

83
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,166
TO ROE VS WADE, IT WOULD SEEM TO

84
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:56,666
BE THIS.

85
00:02:56,733 --> 00:02:57,800
THE FACT THAT THEY WERE

86
00:02:57,866 --> 00:03:00,033
COMPLETELY SILENT ON THIS JUST

87
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,433
SPEAKS VOLUMES.

88
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,509
IT SPEAKS VOLUMES, AND THE

89
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:05,033
REAL WORLD IMPACT OF THIS IN

90
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,733
TEXAS IS 85-90% OF ABORTIONS IN

91
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,300
TEXAS HAPPEN AT THE SIX WEEK OR

92
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:10,066
LATER MARK.

93
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:11,300
MOST WOMEN DON'T EVEN KNOW

94
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:12,442
THEY'RE PREGNANT WITHIN THE SIX

95
00:03:12,466 --> 00:03:13,400
WEEK PERIOD.

96
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:14,476
RIGHT, AND THE WAY THAT, YOU

97
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,100
KNOW, ROE WORKED WAS, IT WAS

98
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:16,666
ABOUT THE VIABILITY OF THE

99
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:16,933
FETUS.

100
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,933
IT WAS 20 to 24 WEEKS.

101
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,200
THAT'S A MASSIVE PERIOD OF TIME

102
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:22,200
IN WHICH WOMEN WERE HAVING LEGAL

103
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:23,333
ABORTIONS.

104
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,442
NOW IN TEXAS, IF YOU GET SUED

105
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:26,100
UNDER THIS LAW, AND YOU LOSE,

106
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,333
THEY CAN SHUT DOWN YOUR CLINIC.

107
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,266
THEY SHUT DOWN THE CLINIC.

108
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:35,066
THEY SHUT THE CLINIC DOWN.

109
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:35,566
WHAT THE FUCK?

110
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:36,366
CONGRATULATIONS, TEXAS, YOU JUST

111
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:39,733
BROKE TMZ.

112
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,366
THEY SHOULDN'T BE COVERING THIS

113
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:40,666
STORY.

114
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:41,366
THEY SHOULD BE DOING WHAT THEY

115
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:42,866
DO BEST, GATHERING ROUND IN A

116
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:43,533
CIRCLE OF AMERICA'S WORST

117
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,866
BACHELOR AND BACHELORETTE PARTY

118
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,333
ATTENDANTS WHILE HARVEY HYDRATES

119
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,133
FROM A LARGE CONTAINER, AND THEY

120
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,933
ALL DISSECT SOMETHING LIKE,

121
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,333
WHETHER OR NOT KATHERINE HEIGL'S

122
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,866
DOG GOT BUTT IMPLANTS.

123
00:03:56,933 --> 00:03:57,600
YOU KNOW, WHAT THEY'RE GOOD AT.

124
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:58,233
THAT GUY IN SHORTS SHOULDN'T BE

125
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:58,800
HAVING TO TALK ABOUT FETAL

126
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:00,866
VIABILITY.

127
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:01,833
THOUGH I GUESS IF HE'S DOING MY

128
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,140
JOB, I GET TO DO HIS, AND SPEND

129
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,100
THE REST OF TONIGHT ASKING YOU

130
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,209
WHICH HOT HOLLYWOOD HUNK HAS

131
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:08,966
THESE SUMMER-READY ABS?

132
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:13,100
GUYS?

133
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,000
GUYS?

134
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:15,433
IT'S WALLACE SHAWN.

135
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:15,966
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

136
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:19,766
THIS IS BETTER.

137
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,166
IT'S A BETTER SHOW.

138
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:22,033
THIS LAW WILL HAVE CATASTROPHIC

139
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,466
EFFECTS.

140
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:24,166
PROVIDERS SAY IT WOULD HAVE

141
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:26,366
PREVENTED AT LEAST 85% OF THE

142
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,100
PROCEDURES PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED

143
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,866
IN THE STATE.

144
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:30,100
AND WHEN GOVERNOR ABBOTT WAS

145
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,833
PRESSED ON WHY HE SIGNED A BILL

146
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,400
THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY FORCE

147
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:35,000
SOMEONE WHO'D EXPERIENCED RAPE

148
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,209
OR INCEST TO CARRY A PREGNANCY

149
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:36,800
TO TERM, HIS RESPONSE...

150
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:38,400
WAS SOMETHING.

151
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:38,966
LET'S MAKE SOMETHING VERY

152
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:40,600
CLEAR.

153
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:44,100
RAPE IS A CRIME.

154
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,966
AND TEXAS WILL WORK TIRELESSLY

155
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:48,766
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ELIMINATE

156
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:49,733
ALL RAPISTS FROM THE STREETS OF

157
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,233
TEXAS BY AGGRESSIVELY GOING OUT

158
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,866
AND ARRESTING THEM AND

159
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:54,800
PROSECUTING THEM AND GETTING

160
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:56,400
THEM OFF THE STREETS.

161
00:04:56,466 --> 00:04:59,066
OH, FUCK OFF.

162
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,500
JUST FUCK RIGHT OFF.

163
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:01,766
SET ASIDE YOU'RE ANNOUNCING

164
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,600
"WE'LL ARREST RAPISTS," LIKE

165
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,842
IT'S A BRAND-NEW IDEA AND YOU'RE

166
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:07,933
TIM COOK UNVEILING A NEW IPHONE,

167
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,833
WE COULD TALK ABOUT HOW ABBOTT

168
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,766
CLEARLY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT

169
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:11,633
IT'S NOT JUST SCARY, FACELESS

170
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,366
CRIMINALS ON THE STREETS

171
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:14,233
PERPETRATING RAPES, BUT MOST

172
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:14,800
OFTEN, IT'S ACTUALLY SOMEONE

173
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:18,866
KNOWN TO THE VICTIM.

174
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:19,500
WE COULD TALK ABOUT HOW

175
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:20,033
ARRESTING RAPISTS DOESN'T

176
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,600
ACTUALLY FIX THE PROBLEM OF

177
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:21,133
WOMEN NEEDING LEGAL, SAFE

178
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,833
ABORTIONS.

179
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,466
WE COULD TALK ABOUT THE MYRIAD

180
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,333
OF REASONS WOMEN GET ABORTIONS,

181
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,000
AND HOW FRAMING THE ISSUE AROUND

182
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:27,900
THE MOST HORRIFIC SITUATIONS

183
00:05:27,966 --> 00:05:29,700
FURTHER DEMONIZES THE PROCEDURE.

184
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:32,266
BUT HONESTLY, IT MIGHT JUST BE

185
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,233
QUICKER JUST TO SAY FUCK OFF,

186
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,933
GREG, AS SHORTHAND FOR THE OTHER

187
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,300
STUFF WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GET

188
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:38,366
INTO.

189
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:39,600
NOW, THANKFULLY, PEOPLE ARE

190
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,133
PUSHING BACK HARD.

191
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,566
ON THURSDAY, THE DOJ ANNOUNCED

192
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,133
IT WAS SUING TEXAS, CALLING THE

193
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,866
LAW AN "UNPRECEDENTED SCHEME TO

194
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:46,500
EVADE JUDICIAL REVIEW," WHICH IT

195
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:49,133
IS.

196
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,700
AND WHEN A PRO-LIFE GROUP SET UP

197
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:52,200
A WEBSITE WHERE PEOPLE COULD

198
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:53,100
REPORT VIOLATIONS OF THE NEW

199
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,333
LAW, PEOPLE STARTED QUICKLY

200
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,866
FLOODING IT WITH TIPS LIKE

201
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:57,500
CLAIMING THE FICTIONAL

202
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:58,709
CHARACTERS IN MARVEL'S AVENGERS

203
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,466
WERE APPARENTLY SEEKING

204
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:02,033
ABORTIONS, WHICH AT THE VERY

205
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,933
LEAST IS A HELL OF A PITCH FOR

206
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,566
AN EPISODE OF "WHAT IF?"

207
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:07,400
AND SOME WENT WITH AN EVEN

208
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,533
BLUNTER APPROACH.

209
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,609
I FOUND THIS WEBSITE FOR

210
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:12,633
LIKE, ANONYMOUSLY SNITCHING ON

211
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,600
PEOPLE WHO BREAK THE TEXAS

212
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,266
HEARTBEAT ACT.

213
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,366
YOU CAN ATTACH ANY FILE YOU WANT

214
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:20,666
TO IT, SO I JUST SENT THEM A

215
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:25,966
BUNCH OF SHREK PORN.

216
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:26,466
YEAH.

217
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:27,600
"TIKTOK USERS BOMBARD

218
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,766
ANTI-ABORTION WEBSITE WITH SHREK

219
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,073
PORN" IS ONE OF THOSE SENTENCES

220
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,340
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HAVE TO SAY

221
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,409
LIKE, "EVERYONE NEEDS TO STOP

222
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:34,966

225
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,400
LOOK, FUCKING WITH PRO-LIFERS ON

226
00:06:42,466 --> 00:06:43,800
TIKTOK IS CLEARLY FUNNY, BUT

227
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:44,533
IT'S NOT GOING TO ROLL BACK THIS

228
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,333
LAW.

229
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,866
AND TEXAS SEEMS TO BE FACING FEW

230
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:49,666
CONSEQUENCES FOR WHAT IT'S DONE.

231
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:51,000
WHEN GREG ABBOTT WAS ASKED

232
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:52,633
WHETHER HE WORRIED THE LAW WOULD

233
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,533
DETER INVESTMENT IN THE STATE,

234
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,100
HE SAID, "YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND

235
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,446
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF BUSINESSES

236
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,766
AND A LOT OF AMERICANS WHO LIKE

237
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,000
THE SOCIAL POSITIONS THAT THE

238
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:00,466
STATE OF TEXAS IS TAKING."

239
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:04,466
AND THE THING IS, SO FAR, MUCH

240
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:05,933
OF CORPORATE AMERICA HAS DECIDED

241
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
TO NOT WEIGH IN ON THIS,

242
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:08,266
A STARK CONTRAST WITH THEIR

243
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,700
RECENT WILLINGNESS TO SPEAK OUT

244
00:07:10,766 --> 00:07:11,200
ON VOTING RIGHTS, RACIAL

245
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:11,833
JUSTICE, AND OTHER SOCIAL

246
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,000
ISSUES.

247
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,700
AND IT'S NOT JUST SILENCE HERE.

248
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:17,166
A MAJOR DONOR TO THE SPONSORS

249
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:18,733
AND COSPONSORS OF THIS BILL IS A

250
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,900
POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE

251
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:22,200
BELONGING TO AT&T, WHO...

252
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:23,600
PENDING APPROVAL OF OUR SALE TO

DISCOVERY... ARE STILL

254
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:27,166
TECHNICALLY OUR BUSINESS DADDY.

255
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:28,800
SO WE ASKED THEM TO COMMENT ON

256
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,566
THIS, AND THEY TOLD US, "AT&T

257
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:32,433
HAS NEVER TAKEN A STANCE ON

258
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,600
ABORTION," AN AMAZING SENTENCE,

259
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:37,100
AND "EMPLOYEE PAC CONTRIBUTIONS

260
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,286

00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,833
BOTH SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS OF

262
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,100
THE TEXAS LEGISLATION."

263
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,366
AND LISTEN, NOT TAKING A STANCE

264
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:45,633
ON THIS ISSUE, RIGHT NOW, IS

265
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,800
TAKING A STANCE.

266
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:50,633
AND BOTH-SIDES'ING ABORTION

267
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,933
ISN'T REALLY THE PR SLAM DUNK

268
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,433
THEY THINK IT IS.

269
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,000
ALTHOUGH IT'S CERTAINLY ON

270
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:56,366
BRAND.

271
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:57,800
AT&T CLEARLY LIKES THEIR PUBLIC

272
00:07:57,866 --> 00:08:00,600
STATEMENTS THE SAME WAY THEY

273
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,200
LIKE THEIR CELL SIGNAL:

274
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:04,433
HILARIOUSLY FUCKING WEAK.

275
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,676
AND LOOK, THE FIGHT TO UNDERMINE

276
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,300
THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO AN

277
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:07,166
ABORTION IS NOT JUST HAPPENING

278
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:08,566
IN TEXAS.

279
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:09,733
THE SUPREME COURT WILL HEAR

280
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,633
ARGUMENTS ABOUT A MISSISSIPPI

281
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,933
ANTI-ABORTION LAW LATER THIS

282
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,200
YEAR THAT'S A DIRECT CHALLENGE

283
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:16,166
TO ROE V WADE.

284
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:17,133
THIS IS NOT A HYPOTHETICAL

285
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,700
DEBATE, BUT THE LATEST

286
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:19,909
ESCALATION IN THE ONGOING ATTACK

287
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,266
ON REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS.

288
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,400
AND I DON'T REALLY HAVE THE

289
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:24,833
WORDS TO EXPRESS HOW INFURIATING

290
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,200
THAT IS, BUT MAYBE THIS SUMS

291
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:33,366
THINGS UP BEST.

292
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:39,600
WELL SAID, BUDDY.

293
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:43,166
AND NOW THIS.

294
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:45,800
AND NOW, YET AGAIN, IT'S THIS

295
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:46,133
TIME OF YEAR.

296
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,433
A FAN FAVORITE AT STARBUCKS

297
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,700
IS BACK WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR

298
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:51,200
NOT.

299
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:53,533
BRINGING BACK ITS PUMPKIN SPICE

300
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,400
LATTE.

301
00:08:57,466 --> 00:08:59,366
GROWS LONGER WITH EACH YEAR.

302
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:01,266
OF PUMPKINS ARE JUST COMING

303
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,066
INTO SEASON NOW, WHAT IS BEING

304
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,066
USED OF THAT PUMPKIN SPICE

305
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:07,266
FLAVOR FOR THE LAST THREE OR FOR

306
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:07,533
WEEKS?

307
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,766
AND MY RESPONSE TO HIM IS I

308
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,266
DON'T CARE.

309
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,666
SHUT UP, ERIC.

310
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:15,766
NOBODY CARES!

311
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,833
ERIC, YOU FUCKING NERD!

312
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,700
I LIKE IT.

313
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:21,033
I DON'T CARE.

314
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,242
I WOULD HAVE THEM TOGETHER

315
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:24,066
BUT DON'T STICK THEM IN EACH

316
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:26,600
OTHER.

317
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,266
GET THE COFFEE AND THE

318
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,066
PUMPKIN, JAM THE PUMPKIN IN THE

319
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:36,100
MILL, SHOVE IT ALL UNTIL SO I

320
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:36,900
MIGHT LIVE RELIGIOUSLY.

321
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:38,833
NOW BUD LIGHT IS ROLLING OUT

322
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,933
OF PUMPKIN SPICE HARD SELTZER.

323
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,733
WAIT, WHAT?

324
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,200
ACTUALLY, CAN WE CUT FOR A

325
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:47,433
SECOND?

326
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,100
BUD LIGHT?

327
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:51,833
BUD LIGHT SELTZER?

328
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,166
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

329
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:58,866
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

330
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:04,733
THIS ISN'T FUN ANYMORE.

331
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,500
YOU RUINED IT.

332
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,400
IT WAS PERFECT AND YOU RUINED I

333
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:14,533
IT.

334
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,133
MOVING ON.

335
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,766
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

336
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:18,000
BELARUS.

337
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:18,500
AND I KNOW YOU MIGHT BE

338
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:19,100
EXPECTING ME TO PLAY THAT GAME

339
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:19,666
WHERE I TELL YOU THAT'S NOT

340
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:20,300
ACTUALLY BELARUS, IT'S SOMEWHERE

341
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:25,800
ELSE.

342
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:26,433
BUT HERE'S THE THING, THAT GAME

343
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,100
WAS SUPPOSED TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO

344
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:27,666
LEARN SOME BASIC GEOGRAPHY.

345
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:28,300
AND I STARTED TO GET THE SENSE

346
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:28,900
THAT SOME OF YOU JUST GREW TO

347
00:10:28,966 --> 00:10:30,500
ENJOY BEING HUMILIATED BY IT.

348
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:31,609
WHICH IS WHY THOSE PARTICULAR

349
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:32,200
PEOPLE WILL BE HAPPY TO KNOW

350
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:32,700
THAT THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY

351
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:33,900
BELARUS.

352
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,266
THAT'S BELARUS.

353
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,700
HAPPY NOW, YOU FREAKS?

354
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:42,466
SPECIFICALLY, WE'D LIKE TO TALK

355
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:43,033
ABOUT BELARUS' PRESIDENT AND

356
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,600
AUTOCRATIC LEADER, ALEXANDER

357
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:44,233
LUKASHENKO, WHO HAS HAD QUITE A

358
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,433
YEAR.

359
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,542
IN FACT, YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED

360
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:49,133
STORIES ABOUT BELARUS POPPING UP

361
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,066
WITH INCREASING REGULARITY.

362
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:52,176
ESPECIALLY SINCE LAST AUGUST,

363
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,800
WHEN THEY HAD A HIGHLY CONTESTED

364
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:53,500
ELECTION WHICH MADE

365
00:10:53,566 --> 00:10:55,800
INTERNATIONAL HEADLINES.

366
00:10:55,866 --> 00:10:56,866
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

367
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,033
UNLEASHING THEIR FURY IN THE

368
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,866
CAPITAL CITY OF MINSK AND

369
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:01,366
ELSEWHERE ALSO AROUND THE

370
00:11:01,433 --> 00:11:03,033
COUNTRY.

371
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,566
MR. LUKASHENKO, WHO HAS RULED

372
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:05,800
FOR NEARLY THREE DECADES, HAS

373
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,366
FACED A WAVE OF ANGER OVER HIS

374
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:09,333
HANDLING OF THE CORONAVIRUS

375
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:15,200
PANDEMIC AND THE ECONOMY.

376
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:15,933
DESPITE THAT, OFFICIAL

377
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,666
STATE-APPROVED EXIT POLLS GAVE

378
00:11:16,733 --> 00:11:17,300
HIM AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF

379
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:19,300
80%.

380
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:20,366
IT'S TRUE.

381
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:20,966
THEY CLAIMED LUKASHENKO WON WITH

382
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:22,700
80% OF THE VOTE.

383
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:23,366
WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY FISHY FOR

384
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,633
A COUPLE OF REASONS.

385
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,000
ONE, THE MASSIVE PROTESTS THAT

386
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:26,700
FOLLOWED.

387
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:28,633
AND TWO, THE IDEA THAT ANY MAN

388
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,433
COULD STILL BE POPULAR AFTER

389
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,580
NEARLY THREE DECADES IN THE

390
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:32,633
PUBLIC EYE.

391
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,233
I'VE ONLY HAD THIS SHOW FOR

392
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,233
EIGHT YEARS, AND EVEN I CAN

393
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,133
BARELY STAND THE SIGHT OF ME.

394
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,466
AND BELARUSIANS AREN'T JUST

395
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:40,676
FURIOUS AT LUKASHENKO FOR HIS

396
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,166
HANDLING OF THE CORONAVIRUS...

397
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:44,300
ALTHOUGH, FROM THE BEGINNING,

398
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:45,133
HIS MANAGEMENT OF IT WAS

399
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,833
INCREDIBLY RECKLESS.

400
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,433
AT FIRST, HE CALLED THE VIRUS

401
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,866
A PSYCHOSIS, AND SAID IT WAS

402
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:53,133
TREATABLE WITH VODKA AND SAUNAS.

403
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,033
AND AT A CROWDED HOCKEY GAME, HE

404
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,266
DENIED ITS EXISTENCE.

405
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,066
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

406
00:11:59,133 --> 00:12:00,533
THERE ARE NO VIRUSES HERE.

407
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,066
DID YOU SEE ANY OF THEM FLYING

408
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:03,300
AROUND?

409
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:03,900
"YEAH, THAT MAKES

410
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:05,600
SENSE!

411
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,100
JUST LOOK AROUND... YOU DON'T

412
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,666
SEE ANY COVID VIRUSES, DO YOU?

413
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:10,100
DO YOU HEAR ANY EBOLA?

414
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,933
SMELL ANY MEASLES?

415
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,100
TASTE ANY AIDS IN THE AIR?

416
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:16,333
NO!

417
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:16,800
OF COURSE NOT.

418
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:17,466
THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT

419
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:17,766
HERE!

420
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:18,976
WHAT IS HERE IS YOUR FEARLESS

421
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,633
LEADER, WHO'S ABOUT TO GO AND

422
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,533
SCORE A HAT TRICK FOR THE MINSK

423
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:27,466
MIDLIFE CRISES."

424
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:28,000
BUT LUKASHENKO'S TERRIBLE

425
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:28,600
HANDLING OF COVID IS JUST THE

426
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:28,966
BEGINNING HERE.

427
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:29,600
LUKASHENKO HAS DESCRIBED HIMSELF

428
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,166
AS "THE LAST AND ONLY DICTATOR

429
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:30,466
IN EUROPE."

430
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:31,366
WHICH IS, IN ITSELF, AN AMAZING

431
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:32,966
THING TO SAY.

432
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:34,833
BRAGGING ABOUT BEING "THE LAST

433
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,600
DICTATOR" IS LIKE BRAGGING ABOUT

434
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,866
BEING THE LAST RADIO SHACK, OR

435
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:40,042
THE LAST PERSON TO MAKE A MOVIE

436
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:42,333
WITH HARVEY WEINSTEIN.

437
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,100
THAT'S NOT AN ENVIABLE TITLE.

438
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,600
AND SADLY, FOR SOME BELARUSIANS,

439
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,500
HE'S THE ONLY LEADER THEY'VE

440
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,066
EVER KNOWN.

441
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:50,200
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

442
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:51,466
I AM 22.

443
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:52,166
YOU'RE 22?

444
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:53,500
YEAH.

445
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:54,766
SO, YOUR WHOLE LIFE, LIVED

446
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:55,733
UNDER ONE PRESIDENT.

447
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,033
HOW DOES THAT FEEL FOR YOU?

448
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,700
WELL, IT FEELS LIKE SHIT.

449
00:12:58,766 --> 00:13:02,600
YEAH, I BET IT DOES.

450
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:03,866
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE PERSON

451
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:04,533
WHO'S BEEN IN CHARGE FOR THAT

452
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,166
MAN'S ENTIRE LIFE IS A HARD

453
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:08,033
BOILED EGG WITH A MUSTACHE WHO

454
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,433
CALLS HIMSELF A DICTATOR AND

455
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,966
THINKS COVID ONLY EXISTS IF HE

456
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:12,142
CAN SEE IT ZOOMING AROUND IN A

457
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,166
TINY LITTLE JET.

458
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:16,600
THAT PROTEST WAS FROM LAST

459
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:17,266
SEPTEMBER, AND THINGS HAVE ONLY

460
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,866
ESCALATED SINCE THEN.

461
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:20,233
YOU MAY REMEMBER A BELARUSIAN

462
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,442
ATHLETE REFUSING TO RETURN HOME

463
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:22,476
DURING THE TOKYO OLYMPICS.

464
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,966
AND BACK IN MAY, THIS HAPPENED.

465
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:27,266
THIS MORNING, BELARUS IS

466
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,266
FACING GROWING INTERNATIONAL

467
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,133
PROTESTS AND CONDEMNATION AFTER

468
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,100
THE COUNTRY'S PRESIDENT,

469
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,666
ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO SENT A

470
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:35,200
FIGHTER JET TO GROUND A

471
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:37,533
COMMERCIAL PLANE FLYING BETWEEN,

472
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,333
TWO EUROPEAN CAPITALS.

473
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
AND WITH IT, 26-YEAR-OLD

474
00:13:40,466 --> 00:13:41,506
DISSIDENT JOURNALIST ROMAN

475
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:42,742
PROTASEVICH AND HIS GIRLFRIEND.

476
00:13:42,766 --> 00:13:43,966
ONE PASSENGER SAYS ROMAN

477
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:45,200
PLEADED, "DON'T DO THIS.

478
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:46,733
THEY'LL KILL ME."

479
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,966
THE RYANAIR CREW REPLIED, "WE

480
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:49,866
HAVE NO CHOICE."

481
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:51,366
YEAH, A JOURNALIST WHO

482
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:52,633
WAS CRITICAL OF THE GOVERNMENT

483
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,400
BRIEFLY PASSED THROUGH

484
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,600
BELARUSIAN AIRSPACE ON A

485
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:56,776
COMMERCIAL FLIGHT, SO LUKASHENKO

486
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,266
PERSONALLY ORDERED A FIGHTER JET

487
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,266
TO INTERCEPT IT AND FORCE IT TO

488
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:02,266
LAND.

489
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,413
NOW, BELARUSIAN AUTHORITIES

490
00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:04,709
ORIGINALLY CLAIMED THEY DID THAT

491
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:05,666
BECAUSE OF AN EMAILED BOMB

492
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:07,300
THREAT FROM HAMAS, BUT RECORDS

493
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:09,766
SHOW THAT EMAIL WAS SENT 24

494
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,042
MINUTES AFTER THEY INFORMED THE

495
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:12,866
PILOT ABOUT THE BOMB THREAT.

496
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:16,066
NOT TO MENTION IT WAS SENT FROM

497
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:18,966
AhmedYurlanov1988@protonmail.com

498
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:19,766
WITH THE SUBJECT LINE "ALLAHU

499
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:20,633
AKBAR."

500
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,533
WHICH IS JUST IMPOSSIBLY LAZY.

501
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,500
IT'S ONE STEP ABOVE EMAILING

502
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,800
FROM BadGuys6969@yahoo.com WITH

503
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:31,633
THE SUBJECT LINE "TERRORIST

504
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,633
STUFF PARENTHESES LIKE 9/11."

505
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,200
SO GIVEN HOW MUCH THINGS SEEM TO

506
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:37,166
BE SPIRALING IN BELARUS, WE

507
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:38,433
THOUGHT TONIGHT, IT'D BE WORTH

508
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,333
GIVING YOU SOME CONTEXT FOR

509
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,000
WHAT'S HAPPENING OVER THERE, AND

510
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:42,500
TAKING A LOOK AT EXACTLY WHO

511
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:44,600
ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO IS.

512
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:45,676
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

513
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,366
THAT HE IS THE GREATEST

514
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:48,133
PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF

515
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,100
BELARUS, SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE HE

516
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,276
IS THE ONLY PRESIDENT IN THE

517
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,033
HISTORY OF BELARUS.

518
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,266
LUKASHENKO WON THE COUNTRY'S

519
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,600
FIRST FREE AND FAIR ELECTION IN

520
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,633
1994, THREE YEARS AFTER THE FALL

521
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,033
OF THE SOVIET UNION, WHEN HE, A

522
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:05,000
FORMER MANAGER OF A STATE-OWNED

523
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:05,600
FARM, VOWED TO RAISE TAXES ON

524
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,566
THE RICH AND DEFEAT CORRUPTION.

525
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:08,166
HE WAS GENUINELY POPULAR AT THE

526
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:09,966
TIME.

527
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:12,400
JUST LISTEN TO A FORMER

528
00:15:12,466 --> 00:15:13,000
AIDE-TURNED-CRITIC RECALL HOW

529
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:13,866
PEOPLE REACTED TO HIM AT HIS

530
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:15,833
RALLIES.

531
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,600
3,000 PEOPLE WHO WERE

532
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,533
LISTENING TO HIM INSTEAD OF

533
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,166
LEAVING THE STADIUM MOVED

534
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:21,033
TOWARDS HIM LIKE AN AVALANCHE.

535
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,766
I REMEMBER AS IF IT HAPPENED

536
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,366
YESTERDAY.

537
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:25,366
THEY WERE REACHING OUT TO HIM

538
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:26,800
LIKE BELIEVERS TO A RELIC

539
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:32,500
PRAYING FOR GOD'S GRACE.

540
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:33,800
WOMEN WERE LIFTING UP THEIR

541
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:34,766
CHILDREN FOR LUKASHENKO TO TOUCH

542
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:35,766
THEM.

543
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,800
OTHERS WERE REACHING OUT WITH

544
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:38,566
BOOKS, NEWSPAPERS, OR EVEN

545
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:39,233
BANKNOTES JUST TO GET HIS

546
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,133
AUTOGRAPH.

547
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,342
WELL, LUKASHENKO WAS NO MICHAEL

548
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:43,646
JACKSON, BUT THIS IS WHAT REALLY

549
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,533
HAPPENED.

550
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,333
WELL, HOLD ON.

551
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,733
WAS HE NO MICHAEL JACKSON?

552
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,566
THINK ABOUT IT.

553
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:51,033
LUKASHENKO WAS IMMENSELY POPULAR

554
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,600
IN THE '90s, DIEHARD FANS PACKED

555
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,133
STADIUMS TO SEE HIM, AND HE

556
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,833
EVENTUALLY TORPEDOED HIS

557
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,666
REPUTATION BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT

558
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:56,742
HE WAS AN ABSOLUTE MONSTER.

559
00:15:56,766 --> 00:15:58,100
TO BE HONEST, I THINK LUKASHENKO

560
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,866
FULLY EARNED THAT COMPARISON.

561
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:03,633
AND HE STILL VERY MUCH PLAYS UP

562
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,709
HIS HUMBLE FARM BACKGROUND

563
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:05,566
THROUGH PHOTO OPS, LIKE THIS

564
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:07,100
ONE, WHERE HE'S HARVESTING

565
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,409
POTATOES WHILE DRESSED LIKE CHEF

566
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:10,700
BOYARDEE AT AN ORGY.

567
00:16:10,766 --> 00:16:12,100
HE ONCE GAVE FOUR BAGS OF

568
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,500
POTATOES AND A TUB OF LARD TO

569
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:15,500
VLADIMIR PUTIN AS A CHRISTMAS

570
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:17,500
GIFT, AND WHEN STEVEN SEAGAL

571
00:16:17,566 --> 00:16:20,600
VISITED BELARUS, LUKASHENKO ALSO

572
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:21,809
GIFTED HIM PRODUCE, WITH "THE

573
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:22,333
WASHINGTON POST" POETICALLY

574
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,000
WRITING AT THE TIME, "THERE WAS

575
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,533
NO HESITATION ON STEVEN SEAGAL'S

576
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,233
FACE AS HE TOOK A RAW, FRESHLY

577
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,233
PEELED CARROT FROM THE HANDS OF

578
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,766
THE BELARUSAN PRESIDENT

579
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,400
ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO AND BIT

580
00:16:31,466 --> 00:16:32,566
INTO IT WITH A SATISFYING

581
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:34,266
CHOMP."

582
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,633
WHICH IS JUST A TAPESTRY OF

583
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,466
WORDS.

584
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:40,000
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED A VIDEO TO

585
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,666
IMAGINE WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO

586
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:44,100
STEVEN SEAGAL USING HIS MOUTH

587
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,400
BONES TO BREAK OFF THE TIP OF

588
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:46,800
THAT RABBIT HOT DOG.

589
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:48,333
BUT WE ARE GOING TO SHOW IT TO

590
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:56,400
YOU ANYWAY.

591
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,266
MAGNIFICENT.

592
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,000
NO DISRESPECT TO SEAGAL CLASSICS

593
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:05,966
LIKE "UNDER SIEGE," "HARD TO

594
00:17:06,033 --> 00:17:07,300
KILL," "ABOVE THE LAW," AND

595
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:08,700
PROBABLY SOMETHING CALLED

596
00:17:08,766 --> 00:17:10,500
"HUNTING THE FIRE" OR WHATEVER,

597
00:17:10,566 --> 00:17:12,833
BUT THAT IS THE GREATEST FILM

598
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,500
STEVEN SEAGAL HAS EVER MADE.

599
00:17:15,566 --> 00:17:16,400
BUT FOR ALL LUKASHENKO'S

600
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:17,566
COMMON-MAN POSTURING, HIS

601
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:18,742
PROMISES TO COMBAT CORRUPTION

602
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:21,066
QUICKLY FELL APART.

603
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:22,500
JUST FIVE MONTHS INTO HIS

604
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:24,533
PRESIDENCY, A DEPUTY COMPILED AN

605
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,966
INVESTIGATION INTO CORRUPTION IN

606
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:27,266
PARLIAMENT, WHICH WAS SAID TO

607
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,033
HAVE CONTAINED CHARGES AGAINST

608
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,400
VARIOUS HIGH-RANKING OFFICIALS.

609
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,033
BUT THE GOVERNMENT BANNED ALL

610
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,400
PRESS COVERAGE OF THE REPORT, TO

611
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:35,676
THE POINT WHERE LOCAL NEWSPAPERS

612
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,842
THAT HAD PLANNED TO PUBLISH THE

613
00:17:36,866 --> 00:17:37,700
RESULTS OF IT, INSTEAD ENDED UP

614
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:38,933
PUBLISHING BLANK PAGES LIKE

615
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,766
THESE.

616
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,366
AND THAT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING

617
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:43,100
OF A DECADES-LONG ASSAULT ON THE

618
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,366
PRESS.

619
00:17:44,433 --> 00:17:46,000
SHORTLY AFTERWARD, LUKASHENKO

620
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,433
REPLACED THE EDITORS-IN-CHIEF OF

621
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,633
FOUR LEADING NEWSPAPERS, AND

622
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,833
TOOK THE NATIONAL RADIO AND

623
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,333
TELEVISION UNDER STRICT CONTROL,

624
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,433
CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT SO

625
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,566
HOSTILE TO INDEPENDENT

626
00:17:56,633 --> 00:17:57,100
JOURNALISM, BELARUS IS NOW

627
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,833
CONSIDERED THE MOST DANGEROUS

628
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,766
COUNTRY IN EUROPE FOR MEMBERS OF

629
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,000
THE MEDIA... WITH MEMBERS

630
00:18:02,066 --> 00:18:03,366
CONSTANTLY SUBJECTED TO

631
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:04,509
VIOLENCE, ARBITRARY DETENTIONS,

632
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:06,866
INTERROGATIONS, RAIDS AND MORE.

633
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:08,600
AND THE CONTROL LUKASHENKO

634
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,700
EXERTS OVER EVEN SMALL, PETTY

635
00:18:10,766 --> 00:18:13,900
DETAILS IS INCREDIBLE.

636
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:15,466
IS IT TRUE THAT YOU CANNOT

637
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:16,066
FILM THE BACK OF LUKASHENKO'S

638
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:17,566
HEAD?

639
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:19,233
YES, IT'S TRUE.

640
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:19,833
IS IT BECAUSE HE HAS A BALD

641
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,133
PATCH?

642
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,566
YEAH, IT'S KIND OF VERY WEIRD

643
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:25,233
HAIRCUT.

644
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,666
SO IT'S GROWING FROM ONE SIDE.

645
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:31,600
WAIT A MINUTE, YOU'RE

646
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,033
TELLING ME THIS GUY IS BALD?

647
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,333
THIS GUY?

648
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
THIS GUY?

649
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:39,266
THIS MAN RIGHT HERE?

650
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,666
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THIS GUY

651
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:41,833
IS BALD?

652
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,266
BALD, YOU SAY?

653
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,000
YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU MIGHT BE

654
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:47,400
RIGHT.

655
00:18:47,466 --> 00:18:49,366
IT LOOKS LIKE HE GREW HIS LEFT

656
00:18:49,433 --> 00:18:50,713
SIDEBURN INTO A RATTAIL AND THEN

657
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:51,266
SHELLACKED IT ONTO HIS BARE

658
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,566
SCALP.

659
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,233
THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION, "IS

660
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,200
LUKASHENKO BALD," AT THIS POINT

661
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:59,233
IS A RESOUNDING, "I WISH."

662
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,666
BUT LUKASHENKO'S BIZARRE

663
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:01,500
BEHAVIOR GOES WELL BEYOND

664
00:19:01,566 --> 00:19:03,300
CENSORING THE MEDIA AND

665
00:19:03,366 --> 00:19:04,200
FORCE-FEEDING STEVEN SEAGAL RAW

666
00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:05,466
VEGETABLES.

667
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:06,700
OVER THE YEARS, HE'S MADE

668
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:08,433
STATEMENTS LIKE, BETTER TO BE A

669
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,200
DICTATOR THAN GAY, AND, "NOT

670
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:12,866
EVERYTHING CONNECTED IN GERMANY

671
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:13,566
WITH THE WELL-KNOWN ADOLF HITLER

672
00:19:13,633 --> 00:19:15,600
WAS BAD," TAKING THE PHRASE

673
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:16,809
"PLAYING DEVIL'S ADVOCATE" A BIT

674
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,766
TOO LITERALLY.

675
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,600
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "OKAY,

676
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:21,566
BUT WHO DIDN'T ACCIDENTALLY

677
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:22,709
PRAISE HITLER IN THE '90s?"

678
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:23,742
FIRST, WHY ARE YOU THINKING

679
00:19:23,766 --> 00:19:26,566
THAT?

680
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:29,566
AND SECOND, JUST THIS SUMMER HE

681
00:19:29,633 --> 00:19:30,466
SAID THE ENTIRE WORLD "GROVELS

682
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:32,566
TO THE JEWS."

683
00:19:32,633 --> 00:19:34,666
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY AWFUL.

684
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:35,500
LUKASHENKO TREATS ANTI-SEMITISM

685
00:19:35,566 --> 00:19:36,133
THE WAY FASHION TREATS LOW-RISE

686
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,900
BELL BOTTOMS.

687
00:19:37,966 --> 00:19:39,109
HE KEEPS BRINGING IT BACK EVEN

688
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:41,133
WHEN IT WAS NEVER ACCEPTABLE AT

689
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,233
ANY POINT IN HISTORY.

690
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:45,900
OVERALL, LUKASHENKO OPERATES

691
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:47,176
FROM THE STANDARD AUTHORITARIAN

692
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,000
PLAYBOOK.

693
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:50,000
AND HE'S REPEATEDLY WORKED TO

694
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:51,766
CODIFY HIS POWER USING A

695
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,333
CONTROVERSIAL REFERENDUM IN 1996

696
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,520
TO EXTEND HIS FIRST TERM AND

697
00:19:54,566 --> 00:19:56,166
DRAMATICALLY INCREASE HIS POWERS

698
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:57,333
AND WEAKEN THOSE OF THE

699
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,666
LEGISLATURE, AND THEN USING A

700
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:00,366
SECOND REFERENDUM TO COMPLETELY

701
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,766
REMOVE TERM LIMITS IN 2004.

702
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,400
AT THIS POINT, OUTSIDE OBSERVER

703
00:20:04,466 --> 00:20:06,800
GROUPS HAVE REPORTED THAT NONE

704
00:20:06,866 --> 00:20:08,533
OF HIS LAST FIVE ELECTION

705
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,066
VICTORIES HAVE BEEN LEGITIMATE.

706
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:11,300
AND THROUGHOUT HIS TIME AS

707
00:20:11,366 --> 00:20:12,266
PRESIDENT, LUKASHENKO HAS

708
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,766
CLAMPED DOWN HARD ON THE

709
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,666
SLIGHTEST SIGNS OF DISSENT.

710
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:18,866
IN 2012, TWO MEN STAGED "TOY

711
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:20,733
PROTESTS," WITH STUFFED ANIMALS

712
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,366
HOLDING ANTI-LUKASHENKO SLOGANS,

713
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:24,100
OBJECTIVELY THE CUTEST DISPLAY

714
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,033
OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE I'VE EVER

715
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,566
SEEN.

716
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:28,266
BUT THAT WOUND UP GETTING BOTH

717
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,066
THOSE MEN SENTENCED TO TEN DAYS

718
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:32,500
IN JAIL, A SENTENCE THAT, IN

719
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:33,266
ITSELF, ACTUALLY INSPIRED A

720
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,166
FOLLOW-UP PROTEST.

721
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:37,466
IN JULY, HUNDREDS OF TEDDY

722
00:20:37,533 --> 00:20:40,033
BEARS RAINED DOWN ON BELARUS.

723
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,342
THEY WORE PARACHUTES AND CARRIED

724
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,833
PRO-DEMOCRACY MESSAGES.

725
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,866
THE MAN BEHIND THE PRANK IS A

726
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:46,533
MARKETING EXECUTIVE WITH A

727
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,833
SWEDISH FIRM.

728
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,066
HE TOOK OFF FROM LITHUANIA IN

729
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:52,400
THIS TINY PLANE.

730
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:53,866
FOR 90 MINUTES, HE LET THE FUR

731
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:54,333
FLY.

732
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,200
PERFECT.

733
00:20:57,266 --> 00:20:57,733
I LOVE IT.

734
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,900
TEN OUT OF TEN.

735
00:20:58,966 --> 00:20:59,900
WE SHOULD BE DROPPING

736
00:20:59,966 --> 00:21:00,833
PARACHUTING TEDDY BEARS FROM THE

737
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,233
SKY HERE ALL THE TIME.

738
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,233
NOT EVEN AS AN ACT OF PROTEST.

739
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,533
IT SHOULD JUST BE A THING WE DO.

740
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,733
"OH, IT'S 1:00 P.M., EVERYONE!

741
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,300
IT'S DAILY PARACHUTING TEDDY

742
00:21:09,366 --> 00:21:10,666
BEAR TIME."

743
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:12,133
WHY DID WE EVEN INVENT PLANES IF

744
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,100
WE'RE NOT GOING TO USE THEM TO

745
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,700
DROP TEDDY BEARS OUT OF THE SKY

746
00:21:14,766 --> 00:21:15,366
AND INSTANTLY IMPROVE EVERYONE'S

747
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:17,566
DAY?

748
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:18,933
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SOCIETY

749
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,566
WE'VE BUILT FOR OURSELVES.

750
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:26,433
WE'RE FUCKING IDIOTS.

751
00:21:26,966 --> 00:21:27,900
NOW, UNSURPRISINGLY, LUKASHENKO

752
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:28,800
TRIED TO COVER THAT INCIDENT UP,

753
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:29,633
WHICH PROVED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE,

754
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,900
DUE TO, YOU KNOW, THE INTERNET.

755
00:21:32,966 --> 00:21:34,300
SO INSTEAD, HE TRIED TO SAVE

756
00:21:34,366 --> 00:21:35,566
FACE BY FIRING TWO GENERALS...

757
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:36,742
THE HEAD OF THE BORDER SERVICE

758
00:21:36,766 --> 00:21:38,533
AND THE HEAD OF THE AIR FORCE.

759
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,266
BUT THE THING IS, EVEN THOUGH

760
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,200
PROTESTS LIKE THOSE CAN BE

761
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:44,633
WHIMSICAL, WHAT HAPPENS TO

762
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,300
DISSIDENTS IN BELARUS IS

763
00:21:45,366 --> 00:21:46,800
HORRIFIC.

764
00:21:46,866 --> 00:21:48,166
OPPOSITION FIGURES HAVE

765
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:49,533
DISAPPEARED OVER THE YEARS, AND

766
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,642
SOME ARE SUSPECTED TO HAVE BEEN

767
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,666
MURDERED BY THE STATE.

768
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:53,666
AND THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS

769
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:54,866
ALLEGATIONS OF POLITICAL

770
00:21:54,933 --> 00:21:56,566
DETAINEES BEING TORTURED, AS

771
00:21:56,633 --> 00:21:58,400
THIS BBC JOURNALIST ONCE TRIED

772
00:21:58,466 --> 00:22:01,366
TO DEMONSTRATE, IN A PRETTY BOLD

773
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:04,100
MANNER.

774
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:07,366
THE OPPOSITION IN BELARUS SAY

775
00:22:07,433 --> 00:22:08,300
THEY WERE TORTURED BY BEING

776
00:22:08,366 --> 00:22:09,033
FORCED TO STRIP NAKED IN

777
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:14,733
FREEZING CONDITIONS.

778
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,366
SO WE GO TO A COLD STORE IN

779
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:18,000
NORTH LONDON WHERE THE

780
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:22,166
TEMPERATURE IS -24 CELSIUS.

781
00:22:22,233 --> 00:22:23,700
SO THE GUARDS FORCED THE

782
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:26,633
PRISONERS TO STRIP NAKED AND

783
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,966
STAND IN THIS POSITION,

784
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:31,933
SPREAD-EAGLED.

785
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,666
AT -20, THERE WAS SNOW OUTSIDE.

786
00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:36,742
IN THE JARGON OF TORTURE, THIS

787
00:22:36,766 --> 00:22:44,766
IS A STRESS POSITION.

788
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,166
QUICK QUESTION, AND IT

789
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:51,966
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

790
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:52,633
PRISONER TORTURE, WHY DID YOU DO

791
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,100
THAT?

792
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,033
YOU COULD HAVE JUST TOLD US THE

793
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,109
PRISONERS WERE FORCED TO STAND

794
00:22:57,133 --> 00:22:58,766
IN THE COLD NAKED.

795
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:00,666
WE'D HAVE BELIEVED YOU.

796
00:23:00,733 --> 00:23:01,400
AND WE'D HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

797
00:23:01,466 --> 00:23:03,666
IMAGINE WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE.

798
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:05,500
WE REALLY DIDN'T NEED TO SEE YOU

799
00:23:05,566 --> 00:23:08,866
STANDING THERE, CAKES OUT, TO

800
00:23:08,933 --> 00:23:12,933
GET YOUR VERY BASIC POINT.

801
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,042
AND THE THING IS, THAT BRUTALITY

802
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:15,866
HAS ONLY ESCALATED.

803
00:23:15,933 --> 00:23:17,700
RECENTLY, LUKASHENKO HAS

804
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:18,366
INCREASED THE NUMBER OF ARRESTS

805
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:20,800
OF HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS AND

806
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:21,533
JOURNALISTS, AND POLICE HAVE

807
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,066
RAIDED THEIR OFFICES AND HOMES.

808
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:24,142
JUST THIS WEEK, AN OPPOSITION

809
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:25,033
LEADER WAS SENTENCED BY THE

810
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,800
STATE TO 11 YEARS IN PRISON.

811
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:29,966
AND EVEN WHEN DISSIDENTS MANAGE

812
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:30,933
TO ESCAPE BELARUS, THEY MAY NOT

813
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,500
BE SAFE.

814
00:23:32,566 --> 00:23:34,133
A FEW WEEKS AGO, AN ACTIVIST

815
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,400
WHO'D FLED TO UKRAINE WENT OUT

816
00:23:35,433 --> 00:23:36,442
FOR A RUN AND WAS FOUND HANGED

817
00:23:36,466 --> 00:23:38,466
IN A PARK.

818
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:39,200
AND WHILE THAT HASN'T BEEN

819
00:23:39,266 --> 00:23:44,066
OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED AS MURDER

820
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:44,833
OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED AS MURDER,

821
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,333
COME ON.

822
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,833
I'M NOT SURE WHICH SPECIES OF

823
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,600
TREES ARE NATIVE TO UKRAINE, BUT

824
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:48,366
I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM

825
00:23:48,433 --> 00:23:48,900
NATURALLY HAVE BELARUSIAN

826
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:51,766
DISSIDENTS HANGING FROM THEM.

827
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:52,666
THE POINT IS, FOR NEARLY THREE

828
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:54,466
DECADES NOW, BELARUS HAS

829
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:55,900
EXPERIENCED A BRUTAL CYCLE OF

830
00:23:55,966 --> 00:23:57,433
OPPRESSION IN WHICH LUKASHENKO

831
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,200
WINS ELECTIONS THAT ARE NEITHER

832
00:23:59,266 --> 00:24:00,433
FREE NOR FAIR, LOCKS UP HIS

833
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,133
POLITICAL OPPONENTS, PEOPLE TAKE

834
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,376
TO THE STREETS IN PROTEST, AND

835
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,633
HE VIOLENTLY CRACKS DOWN.

836
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,900
IT'S NO WONDER THE BELARUSIAN

837
00:24:06,966 --> 00:24:09,200
PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE HAD ENOUGH.

838
00:24:09,266 --> 00:24:10,833
A LEAKED POLL SHOWED THAT ONLY

839
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,766
ABOUT A THIRD OF THE POPULATION

840
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,466
TRUSTS LUKASHENKO.

841
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:14,700
WHICH IS IMPRESSIVELY LOW,

842
00:24:14,766 --> 00:24:15,600
CONSIDERING, REMEMBER, HE

843
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:18,366
CONTROLS THE NATIONAL MEDIA.

844
00:24:18,433 --> 00:24:20,200
AND EVEN THERE, HIS GRIP IS

845
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:23,600
SLIPPING.

846
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:24,166
LAST YEAR, PRESENTERS ON A

847
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:25,242
STATE-TV MORNING SHOW WALKED OFF

848
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:25,866
AND RESIGNED, LEAVING VIEWERS

849
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:30,966
WATCHING THIS.

850
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,133
WOW.

851
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,300
THAT'S BOTH A BRAVE ACT OF

852
00:24:37,366 --> 00:24:38,700
PROTEST BY BELARUSIAN

853
00:24:38,766 --> 00:24:41,100
BROADCASTERS, AND ALSO

854
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:43,800
EVERYONE'S DREAM PANEL ON "THE

855
00:24:43,866 --> 00:24:43,966
VIEW."

856
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:46,533
AND YOU DO GET THE SENSE

857
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,700
LUKASHENKO MAY BE FEELING SOME

858
00:24:48,766 --> 00:24:50,400
PRESSURE.

859
00:24:50,466 --> 00:24:51,866
WHEN MARCHERS LIKENED HIM TO A

860
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:53,066
COCKROACH AND ONLINE POLLS

861
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:55,000
SHOWED HIM HAVING ONLY 3%

862
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:56,500
SUPPORT FROM HIS PEOPLE, INSTEAD

863
00:24:56,566 --> 00:24:58,333
OF SIMPLY IGNORING IT, THIS WAS

864
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,800
HOW HE RESPONDED.

865
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,533
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT

866
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,200
THE SERVING PRESIDENT HAS JUST

867
00:25:03,266 --> 00:25:07,800
3% SUPPORT?

868
00:25:07,866 --> 00:25:10,533
STOP HARASSING AND INSULTING US,

869
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,033
CALLING ME "A MUSTACHED

870
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:11,800
COCKROACH," ETCETERA.

871
00:25:11,866 --> 00:25:12,433
I AM STILL THE PRESIDENT OF THIS

872
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,066
COUNTRY.

873
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:13,733
IN NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD ARE

874
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,566
YOU ALLOWED TO INSULT PEOPLE.

875
00:25:16,633 --> 00:25:21,466
UH, YES, YOU ARE.

876
00:25:21,533 --> 00:25:22,000
YEAH, YOU DEFINITELY ARE.

877
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:23,633
I'LL PROVE IT.

878
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,633
YOUR SUIT'S TOO BIG, YOU SUCK AT

879
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,300
HOCKEY, AND WHATEVER IT IS

880
00:25:25,366 --> 00:25:26,233
YOU'RE DOING WITH YOUR HAIR

881
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,966
ISN'T FUCKING WORKING.

882
00:25:28,033 --> 00:25:29,233
SEE?

883
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:34,400
NOT IN JAIL.

884
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,266
I'M NOT IN JAIL.

885
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:37,066
SO THINGS ARE CLEARLY BLEAK IN

886
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:38,733
BELARUS.

887
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,809
AND SVIATLANA TSIKHANOUSKAYA...

888
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:40,400
THE WOMAN WIDELY BELIEVED TO BE

889
00:25:40,466 --> 00:25:41,576
THE REAL WINNER OF LAST YEAR'S

890
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,800
ELECTION, AND WHO, BY THE WAY,

891
00:25:42,866 --> 00:25:44,433
ONLY RAN AFTER HER HUSBAND,

892
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,000
LUKASHENKO'S INITIAL OPPONENT,

893
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:48,533
WAS IMPRISONED... HAS FLED THE

894
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,966
COUNTRY.

895
00:25:50,033 --> 00:25:50,666
BUT SHE'S STILL LEADING THE

896
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:51,842
COUNTRY'S PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT

897
00:25:51,866 --> 00:25:53,166
FROM EXILE.

898
00:25:53,233 --> 00:25:54,309
SHE'S ASKED WORLD LEADERS TO

899
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:55,800
DEMAND THE RELEASE OF WHAT'S

900
00:25:55,866 --> 00:25:56,533
THOUGHT TO BE OVER 650 POLITICAL

901
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,966
PRISONERS.

902
00:25:59,033 --> 00:26:00,176
AND I WILL SAY, THE E.U., THE

903
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,933
U.S., THE U.K. AND CANADA HAVE

904
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,266
IMPOSED SANCTIONS ON BELARUS

905
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:05,366
TARGETING EVERYTHING FROM CLOSE

906
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:06,100
ASSOCIATES OF LUKASHENKO TO THE

907
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:07,933
BELARUSIAN ECONOMY.

908
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,766
AND THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS

909
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,233
JUST RECENTLY IMPOSED MORE.

910
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,500
BUT THE TRUTH IS, SANCTIONS CAN

911
00:26:12,566 --> 00:26:14,333
ONLY DO SO MUCH.

912
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,766
AND LUKASHENKO DOESN'T SEEM KEEN

913
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:17,333
TO END HIS REIGN.

914
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,666
IN FACT, MANY THINK THAT HE'S

915
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:20,500
GROOMED HIS YOUNGEST SON KOLYA

916
00:26:20,566 --> 00:26:21,933
TO TAKE HIS PLACE, BECAUSE SINCE

917
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,433
HE WAS YOUNG, HE'S BEEN DRAGGING

918
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,576
HIM ALONG EVERYWHERE HE GOES ON

919
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,366
STATE BUSINESS.

920
00:26:26,433 --> 00:26:27,533
HERE HE IS.

921
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,533
HERE HE IS AGAIN.

922
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,733
HERE HE IS AGAIN.

923
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,300
HE'S IN ALL OF THESE PHOTOS.

924
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:33,933
I DON'T KNOW WHEN EUROPEAN

925
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,433
"BRING YOUR KID TO WORK DAY" IS,

926
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,566
BUT IT CAN'T BE "ALWAYS."

927
00:26:38,633 --> 00:26:40,333
SO AT THIS POINT, IT LOOKS LIKE

928
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,640
THE ONLY THING THAT WILL REALLY

929
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,433
IMPROVE THINGS IN BELARUS IS IF

930
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,509
THE PEOPLE THERE SOMEHOW MANAGE

931
00:26:44,533 --> 00:26:45,400
TO REFORM THEIR CONSTITUTION AND

932
00:26:45,466 --> 00:26:46,766
ENSURE THAT FREE AND FAIR

933
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:48,033
ELECTIONS ARE FINALLY HELD.

934
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,066
AND AS WE'VE SEEN TONIGHT,

935
00:26:50,133 --> 00:26:51,300
FIGHTING FOR THOSE CHANGES IS

936
00:26:51,366 --> 00:26:53,333
GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY RISKY.

937
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,233
BUT THERE MAY BE ONE EXTREMELY

938
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,400
SMALL WAY THAT WE CAN HELP HERE,

939
00:26:57,466 --> 00:26:59,133
OR, IF NOT HELP, AT LEAST ANNOY

940
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,733
THE SHIT OUT OF LUKASHENKO.

941
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,966
BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING WE

942
00:27:03,033 --> 00:27:04,209
KNOW HE HATES... OTHER THAN GAY

943
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:06,433
PEOPLE, JEWS, HIS OWN BALD HEAD,

944
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,766
AND ANYONE WHO DISAGREES WITH

945
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:10,033
HIM... IT'S TEDDY BEARS.

946
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,633
AND WHY WOULDN'T HE?

947
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,466
I MEAN, LOOK AT THEM!

948
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:13,933
THEY'RE EVERYTHING HE'S NOT...

949
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,166
CUTE, LOVABLE, AND COVERED IN

950
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:16,276
THICK, NATURAL, HAIR ALL THE WAY

951
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:20,200
AROUND.

952
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:22,833
