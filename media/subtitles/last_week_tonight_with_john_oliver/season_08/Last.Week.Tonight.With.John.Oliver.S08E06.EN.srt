1
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:27,666
HI THERE!

2
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:28,666
WELCOME TO THE SHOW,

3
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:29,600
STILL, UNFORTUNATELY,

4
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,700
TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK VOID.

5
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:32,500
THINK OF IT LIKE PRINCE PHILIP,

6
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,033
IN THAT IT'S WHITE,

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,000
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING,

8
00:00:35,066 --> 00:00:35,633
AND I THOUGHT FOR SURE IT'D BE

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,581
GONE BY NOW.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,433
AND WE HAVE TO DIVE STRAIGHT IN

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,366
WITH TUESDAY'S HORRIFIC EVENTS

12
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:39,300
IN THE ATLANTA AREA,

13
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:39,933
WHERE A GUNMAN

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,966
KILLED EIGHT PEOPLE,
SIX OF THEM ASIAN WOMEN,

15
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:44,300
AT THREE DIFFERENT SPAS.
AND SYMPATHY FOR THE VICTIMS HAS

16
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:47,333
POURED OUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY,
ALTHOUGH THERE'VE BEEN SOME

17
00:00:48,642 --> 00:00:49,908
TERRIBLE REACTIONS, TOO...

18
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:50,942
LIKE THE ONE FROM THIS OFFICER

19
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:52,766
WHO BRIEFED THE PRESS.

20
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:54,300
THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS

21
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:56,333
ABOUT THIS STATEMENT, WHICH MANY

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,333
FEEL APPEARS TO SYMPATHIZE WITH

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,166
THE SHOOTER AND NOT HIS ALLEGED

24
00:00:58,233 --> 00:00:59,500
VICTIMS.

25
00:00:59,566 --> 00:01:00,833
I SPOKE WITH INVESTIGATORS.

26
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,800
THEY INTERVIEWED HIM THIS

27
00:01:01,866 --> 00:01:03,300
MORNING AND I... THEY GOT THAT

28
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:06,133
IMPRESSION THAT, YES, HE... HE

29
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,466
UNDERSTOOD THE GRAVITY OF IT

30
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:09,133
AND HE WAS PRETTY MUCH FED UP,

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,666
AT THE END OF HIS ROPE.

32
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:11,800
AND... AND YESTERDAY WAS

33
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:12,333
A REALLY BAD DAY FOR HIM.

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,233
AND THIS IS WHAT HE DID.

35
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,766
OKAY, ABSOLUTELY

36
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:16,733
FUCKING NOT.

37
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,909
YOU GET THAT THIS IS A PRESS

38
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:18,733
CONFERENCE ABOUT A MASS MURDER,

39
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,566
RIGHT?

40
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:21,400
YOU DON'T GET TO MINIMIZE WHAT

41
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:22,100
HAPPENED LIKE THAT.

42
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,966
"REALLY BAD DAY?"

43
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:24,933
ALEXANDER HAD A TERRIBLE,

44
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,533
HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY,

45
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,433
AND WHAT HE DID WAS SHRUG IT

46
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,266
THE FUCK OFF AND GO TO BED WHILE

47
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,000
MANAGING TO MURDER ZERO PEOPLE.

48
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:35,466
THAT COP EVEN WENT ON TO REPEAT

49
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:36,693
THE SHOOTER'S CLAIMS THAT HIS

50
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:38,066
ATTACKS WEREN'T RACIALLY

51
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:40,200
MOTIVATED; INSTEAD,

52
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,633
HIS "SEXUAL ADDICTION" WAS

53
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,433
TO BLAME FOR THE KILLINGS.

54
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,100
WHICH ALREADY FEELS LIKE A

55
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:46,066
WEIRD DISTINCTION TO BE MAKING.

56
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:47,133
"HEY!

57
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,000
I MIGHT BE A MASS-MURDERER,

58
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:48,866
BUT WATCH WHO YOU CALL A RACIST,

59
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:49,666
BUDDY!

60
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:50,500
WORDS HURT!"

61
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:51,700
AND WHILE IT IS STILL EARLY,

62
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:53,700
DETAILS ARE STILL COMING OUT,

63
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:54,266
AND AUTHORITIES SEEM UNWILLING

64
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,500
TO CALL THIS A HATE CRIME.

65
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:57,500
I WILL SAY, A WHITE MAN

66
00:01:57,566 --> 00:01:59,233
DRIVING ACROSS COUNTIES

67
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,700
TO TWO DIFFERENT TOWNS,

68
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:02,066
GOING TO THREE ASIAN-OWNED

69
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:03,309
BUSINESSES, SHOOTING AND KILLING

70
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,433
SIX ASIAN WOMEN, IN A CITY

71
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,133
THAT'S ONLY ABOUT 4% ASIAN

72
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,500
SURE AS SHIT SEEMS A LOT MORE

73
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:08,600
LIKE A HATE CRIME THAN

74
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:11,366
"A BAD FUCKING DAY."

75
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:12,766
AND THIS IS JUST THE LATEST DATA

76
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:13,976
POINT IN A DISTURBING PATTERN.

77
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,400
ONE GROUP TRACKING HATE-RELATED

78
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:16,200
INCIDENTS AGAINST

79
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:17,666
ASIAN-AMERICANS... WHICH INCLUDE

80
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:18,766
PHYSICAL ASSAULTS,

81
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,033
VERBAL HARASSMENT, AND

82
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,333
CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS LIKE

83
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,733
REFUSAL OF SERVICE... FOUND

84
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,166
NEARLY 3800 REPORTED IN JUST

85
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:25,900
THE PAST YEAR.

86
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:27,666
IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE

87
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:28,876
TREND THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN SPOKE

88
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,000
ABOUT JUST LAST WEEK.

89
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:32,833
VICIOUS HATE CRIMES AGAINST

90
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,733
ASIAN-AMERICANS, WHO'VE BEEN

91
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,433
ATTACKED, HARASSED, BLAMED, AND

92
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,200
SCAPEGOATED.

93
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:39,933
IT'S WRONG, IT'S UN-AMERICAN,

94
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,800
AND IT MUST STOP.

95
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:45,200
YEAH.

96
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:49,700
IT MUST.

97
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:51,033
AND I AM REALLY GLAD HE

98
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,209
CONDEMNED HATE CRIMES AGAINST

99
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:53,376
ASIAN-AMERICANS THERE, BUT TO

100
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,200
SAY THAT THEY ARE "UN-AMERICAN?"

101
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:54,966
I'D LOVE TO VISIT THE NATION

102
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:56,276
THAT EXISTS IN JOE BIDEN'S HEAD,

103
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,500
BECAUSE IT'S A PLACE WHERE

104
00:02:57,566 --> 00:02:58,100
RACISM "IS NOT WHO WE ARE" AND

105
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,333
RACIAL ATTACKS AGAINST ASIANS

106
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,466
ARE SOMEHOW "UN-AMERICAN,"

107
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:03,166
DESPITE THE FACT... AND FAR BE

108
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:04,166
IT FROM ME TO EXPLAIN THIS TO

109
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:05,133
SOMEONE WHO SEEMS LIKE HE'S

110
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,066
LIVED THROUGH MOST OF AMERICAN

111
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:06,800
HISTORY... ANTI-ASIAN RACISM HAS

112
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:08,333
LONG BEEN A FACT OF AMERICAN

113
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,233
LIFE.

114
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:11,700
FROM THE TREATMENT OF

115
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:12,466
CHINESE RAILROAD WORKERS

116
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:14,000
IN THE 1800s, THROUGH

117
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:15,366
THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT,

118
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:19,000
THROUGH THE WATSONVILLE RIOTS

119
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,200
IN 1930, IN WHICH A WHITE MOB

120
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:22,700
RAMPAGED THROUGH A FILIPINO

121
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:23,133
COMMUNITY,

122
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,333
THROUGH THE INTERNMENT OF

123
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,700
JAPANESE AMERICANS DURING

124
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:26,300
WORLD WAR II, THROUGH DEADLY

125
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:27,733
CASES OF RACIAL SCAPEGOATING

126
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,366
LIKE THE MURDER OF VINCENT CHIN,

127
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:29,966
KILLED IN 1982 BY TWO

128
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:31,433
WHITE AUTOWORKERS IN DETROIT.

129
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,566
WITNESSES SAID THE MEN MISTOOK

130
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:34,233
CHIN, A CHINESE-AMERICAN, FOR

131
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,633
BEING JAPANESE, BLAMED HIM FOR

132
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,566
TAKING THEIR JOBS, AND BEAT HIM

133
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:38,400
TO DEATH.

134
00:03:38,466 --> 00:03:39,733
AND BY THE WAY, EVEN THOUGH

135
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,066
THEY'D REPORTEDLY USED

136
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,209
RACIAL SLURS DURING THE ATTACK,

137
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:43,800
THE MEN STILL TRIED TO CLAIM

138
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:45,800
THEY WERE NOT MOTIVATED BY RACE.

139
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:48,933
SO NOT ONLY ARE HATE CRIMES

140
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,133
AGAINST ASIAN-AMERICANS VERY

141
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,833
MUCH "AMERICAN," SO IS DENYING

142
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,666
THAT THEY'RE RACIST.

143
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,600
IT'S ALL SO AMERICAN, IN FACT,

144
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:55,666
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM COULD

145
00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:58,600
"OH, SAY CAN YOU SEE

146
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,600
THAT THIS WASN'T ABOUT RACE."

147
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,500
AND OUR LONG, UGLY HISTORY OF

148
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:04,566
ANTI-ASIAN RACISM... AND THE

149
00:04:04,633 --> 00:04:06,166
FACT IT OFTEN PEAKS DURING TIMES

150
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:09,900
OF CRISIS... IS THE VERY REASON

151
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:10,976
WHY, JUST LAST YEAR, MANY WERE

152
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,233
LOUDLY WARNING THAT TRUMP

153
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,000
CALLING COVID NAMES LIKE

154
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:15,209
"THE CHINA VIRUS" WAS LIKELY TO

155
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:20,033
LEAD TO A RISE IN VIOLENCE

156
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,380
AGAINST PEOPLE OF ASIAN DESCENT,

157
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:24,100
AN ARGUMENT THAT AT THE TIME,

158
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:24,666
NOT EVERYONE SEEMED TO FIND

159
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:25,633
CONVINCING.

160
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,966
I THINK IF THE LEFT WANTS TO

161
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:27,700
FOCUS ON PC LABELING THIS VIRUS,

162
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:29,533
IT IS A GREAT WAY TO GET TRUMP

163
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:29,800
REELECTED.

164
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:30,400
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

165
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:31,706
PEOPLE CALLING IT WHATEVER THEY

166
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:31,866
WANT.

167
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:33,042
IT'S A DEADLY VIRUS THAT DID

168
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:33,600
ORIGINATE IN WUHAN.

169
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,233
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT.

170
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,133
OH, GOOD!

171
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,300
MEGHAN McCAIN DOESN'T

172
00:04:36,366 --> 00:04:37,533
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT!

173
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,366
LISTEN NOT TO THE SCORES OF

174
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:40,709
ASIAN-AMERICANS TELLING EVERYONE

175
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:41,566
THAT THE TERM IS DANGEROUS AND

176
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:42,466
OFFENSIVE!

177
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,033
INSTEAD, GATHER ROUND,

178
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,209
AND TAKE THE WORD OF A WEALTHY

179
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:46,376
WHITE WOMAN WHO'S DRESSED LIKE

180
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,542
SHE'S ABOUT TO LAY OFF 47 PEOPLE

181
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:49,833
OVER ZOOM.

182
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,933
NOW, I WILL SAY, McCAIN POSTED

183
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,120
THIS WEEK, "STOP ASIAN HATE"

184
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,566
WITH THREE BROKEN HEART EMOJIS.

185
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:56,366
WHICH IS A FINE SENTIMENT TO

186
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:57,833
THROW UP ON TWITTER AFTER THE

187
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,166
FACT, BUT THERE HAS TO BE AN

188
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,566
UNDERSTANDING THAT SAYING,

189
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:02,709
"I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

190
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:04,466
CALLING IT THE CHINA VIRUS"

191
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:05,766
IS VERY MUCH GIVING SPACE FOR

192
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,833
THAT HATE TO GROW.

193
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,566
AND THE MINIMIZATION OF RACIST

194
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:10,742
RHETORIC PLAYS INTO THE HARMFUL

195
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:13,200
STEREOTYPE OF ASIAN-AMERICANS AS

196
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:15,400
A "MODEL MINORITY," PITTING THEM

197
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:17,400
AGAINST OTHER MINORITY GROUPS

198
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:18,800
AND PRESSURING THEM TO SWALLOW

199
00:05:18,866 --> 00:05:20,366
THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH RACISM

200
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:21,442
WITHOUT MAKING A STINK, BECAUSE

201
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:22,133
THAT'S HOW YOU EARN

202
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,500
WHITE ACCEPTANCE.

203
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:25,576
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT TAKES

204
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,466
ITS TOLL.

205
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:28,066
JUST LISTEN TO BASKETBALL PLAYER

206
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:29,266
JEREMY LIN, WHO RECENTLY

207
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,733
REVEALED THAT HE'D BEEN CALLED

208
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,266
"CORONAVIRUS" ON THE COURT, AND

209
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,200
SPOKE ABOUT THE EVENTS OF THIS

210
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,300
WEEK.

211
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:36,833
ASIANS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN...

212
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,866
HAVE BEEN PROJECTED AS BEING

213
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,600
OTHERS OR OUTSIDERS AND YOU

214
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,166
CAN... YOU CAN HEAR AND SEE

215
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:44,933
THESE MICROAGGRESSIONS, IN LIKE,

216
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,533
"OH, NO, WHERE ARE YOU REALLY

217
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,133
FROM?"

218
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,000
OR, YOU KNOW, TALKING ABOUT THE

219
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:52,633
WAY WE LOOK OR OUR COMPLEXION

220
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,166
AND, AGAIN, CALLING IT THE CHINA

221
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:54,900
VIRUS, KUNG FLU VIRUS, THAT IS

222
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:56,766
ADDING TO IT, FUELING THE FIRE,

223
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:57,976
AND NOW WE'RE STARTING TO SEE A

224
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,933
LOT OF THOSE MICROAGGRESSIONS

225
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,700
TURN INTO ACTUAL ACTS OF

226
00:05:59,766 --> 00:06:00,900
VIOLENCE.

227
00:06:00,966 --> 00:06:02,233
RIGHT.

228
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,266
COMMENTS LIKE, "WHERE ARE YOU

229
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,700
REALLY FROM?" ARE CONSTANT

230
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,600
REMINDERS OF HOW

231
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,400
ASIAN-AMERICANS ARE REGARDED AS

232
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:10,642
OUTSIDERS, AS PEOPLE WHO DON'T

233
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,200
BELONG.

234
00:06:12,266 --> 00:06:13,933
AND THE FACT IS, "WHERE ARE YOU

235
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,366
REALLY FROM?" IS JUST NOT AN

236
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:17,066
APPROPRIATE QUESTION TO ASK

237
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:18,142
ANYONE, UNLESS THEY'VE JUST

238
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,376
OPENED UP THEIR TORSO TO REVEAL

239
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
A TINY ALIEN SQUID OPERATING

240
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:23,200
A ROBOT BODY.

241
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:26,066
AND EVEN THEN, HONESTLY, IT'S

242
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:27,200
STILL A BIT IFFY.

243
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:28,066
"WELL MY PARENTS ARE FROM

244
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:29,209
RIGEL VII, BUT I WAS BORN IN

245
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:30,233
CINCINNATI, YOU DICK!"

246
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,233
THE COMFORT PEOPLE HAVE WITH

247
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,733
DIMINISHING AND OTHERING ASIANS

248
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,233
IS PERVASIVE.

249
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,666
EVEN THAT OFFICER YOU SAW

250
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:38,033
EARLIER WAS LAST YEAR PROMOTING

251
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,066
T-SHIRTS ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE

252
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,400
CALLING COVID-19 AN

253
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:45,300
"IMPORTED VIRUS FROM CHY-NA."

254
00:06:45,366 --> 00:06:47,400
AND THE FACT THE KILLER CHOSE

255
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:49,233
THESE PARTICULAR WOMEN,

256
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,200
WORKING LOW-WAGE JOBS, AS

257
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:52,966
TARGETS FOR HIS "SEX ADDICTION"

258
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:53,966
SPEAKS TO HOW ASIAN-AMERICAN

259
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:55,700
WOMEN, IN PARTICULAR, HAVE TO

260
00:06:55,766 --> 00:07:00,766
DEAL WITH HYPERSEXUALIZATION,

261
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,200
AND HOW ASIAN WORKERS TO THE

262
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:03,442
EXTENT THAT THEY ARE SEEN AT ALL

263
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:05,633
ARE SEEN MORE FOR THE LABOR THAT

264
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,766
THEY PROVIDE RATHER THAN THE

265
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:08,633
FULL THREE-DIMENSIONAL HUMANS

266
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,033
THAT THEY ARE.

267
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,866
SO THERE'S PRETTY CLEARLY A LOT

268
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:11,233
THAT NEEDS TO BE CONFRONTED

269
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,166
HERE, AS MANY HAVE BEEN POINTING

270
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:12,866
OUT.

271
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:13,942
I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE STARTING

272
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,166
TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION,

273
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:16,533
BUT THIS CANNOT BE IT.

274
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,133
ASIAN-AMERICAN WOMEN HAVE BEEN

275
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,933
LONG INVISIBLE IN THIS SOCIETY.

276
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,266
RIGHT?

277
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,166
YOU KNOW, WE'RE BEING TOLD THIS

278
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,000
IS NOT A RACIST INCIDENT.

279
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:25,366
IT IS A RACIST INCIDENT BECAUSE

280
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:26,442
OF THE WAY ASIAN-AMERICAN WOMEN

281
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:27,300
EXPERIENCE RACISM IN OUR

282
00:07:27,366 --> 00:07:29,100
COUNTRY.

283
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,866
EXACTLY.

284
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:32,200
THIS ISN'T JUST A CONVERSATION

285
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:33,000
ABOUT THIS WEEK.

286
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:34,600
IT'S A CONVERSATION ABOUT

287
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:37,033
THE CENTURIES LEADING UP TO IT.

288
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,633
NOW, SOME HAVE RESPONDED BY

289
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,900
CALLING FOR INCREASED POLICE

290
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:42,126
PRESENCE, ALTHOUGH OTHERS ARE

291
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,866
UNDERSTANDABLY WARY OF "MORE

292
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:45,733
POLICE" BEING A GOOD SOLUTION.

293
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,300
MORE GUYS LIKE "DEPUTY OOPS ALL

294
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,606
FOREHEAD" HERE AREN'T LIKELY TO

295
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,333
MAKE ASIAN-AMERICANS, OR,

296
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,509
INDEED, OTHER COMMUNITIES OF

297
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:52,700
COLOR AROUND THEM, FEEL MUCH

298
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:53,566
SAFER.

299
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:55,466
OTHERS HAVE SUGGESTED SOLUTIONS

300
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:56,900
FROM CONNECTING VICTIMS OF

301
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:57,976
TRAUMA TO SUPPORT AFTER THE

302
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,433
FACT, TO IMPROVING COLLECTION

303
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,066
AND REPORTING OF STATISTICS

304
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:02,173
ON ANTI-ASIAN VIOLENCE AND

305
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:05,800
DISCRIMINATION, SO WE HAVE

306
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:06,600
A MUCH MORE COMPLETE PICTURE OF

307
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,566
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

308
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:08,500
AND IF YOU DO WANT TO HELP,

309
00:08:08,566 --> 00:08:09,333
THERE ARE SOME GREAT

310
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,233
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THESE ONES

311
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,733
THAT COULD REALLY USE YOUR HELP.

312
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,300
LOOK, ASIAN-AMERICAN AND

313
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:16,200
ASIAN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES

314
00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:17,833
HAVE BEEN FEELING EXTREMELY

315
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,976
VULNERABLE FOR A LONG TIME,

316
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,133
AND ESPECIALLY SO RIGHT NOW.

317
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,766
AND FOR A GROUP WHOSE SUFFERING

318
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,009
HAS HISTORICALLY FELT INVISIBLE

319
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:27,900
TO THE MEDIA AND THE COUNTRY AT

320
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,009
LARGE, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

321
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:30,633
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PAIN RIGHT NOW.

322
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,033
BUT MORE THAN THAT, DISMANTLING

323
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,333
ANTI-ASIAN PREJUDICE SHOULD BE

324
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,666
ANOTHER KEY PART OF DISMANTLING

325
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:36,433
THE CHOKEHOLD THAT

326
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,066
WHITE SUPREMACY HAS

327
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:38,833
ON THIS COUNTRY.

328
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,566
BECAUSE AS WE'VE SEEN SINCE ITS

329
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:42,200
FOUNDATION, AND CONTINUED TO SEE

330
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:44,566
THIS WEEK, PEOPLE WILL BEND OVER

331
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:45,800
BACKWARDS TO CALL RACISM

332
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:48,333
ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT IT IS.

333
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,600
AND THAT IS UNFORTUNATELY VERY

334
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,466
FUCKING AMERICAN.

335
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:52,800
AND NOW THIS.

336
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,900
AND NOW...

337
00:08:55,966 --> 00:08:57,266
EVEN DURING A PANDEMIC,

338
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,600
LOCAL NEWS CANNOT BE TRUSTED

339
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,866
WITH ST. PATRICK'S DAY.

340
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:03,933

341
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,866
TOP OF THE MORNING TO YOU.

342
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:06,466
TOP OF THE MORNING TO YOU,

343
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:07,200
SAN DIEGO.

00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:09,100
TOP OF THE MORNING TO YOU.

345
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,766
TOP OF THE MORNING TO YOU.

TOP OF THE MORNING TO YOU

348
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:18,633
TOO.

349
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,633
IT'S WEE MORE THAN A LITTLE

350
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,433
CLOUD COVER OUT THERE.

351
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,900
IT'S TOTALLY CLOUD COVERED.

352
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:23,733
AH, LADS AND LASSES,

353
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,100
WE WILL HAVE SUNSHINE.

354
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,233
THE LUCK OF THE IRISH.

355
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:27,900
THE LUCK OF THE IRISH BE WITH

356
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:29,533
US.

357
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,866
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I SAID.

358
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:32,033
BUT I WATCHED A LOT OF

359
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,300
LUCKY CHARMS COMMERCIALS.

360
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,809
WELCOME TO OUR FAIR CITY

361
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:44,066
WHERE THE GIRLS ARE SO PRETTY.

362
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:44,866
LET'S START WITH ONE OF THOSE

363
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:48,900
LOVELY LADIES.

364
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:51,266
MOVING ON.

365
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,542
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

366
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:53,100
PLASTIC.

367
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,766
IT'S VERY MUCH THE JANE LYNCH

368
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:55,966
OF MATERIALS, IN THAT

369
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:57,333
IT'S INCREDIBLY VERSATILE,

370
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,166
APPEARS IN ALMOST EVERYTHING,

371
00:09:58,233 --> 00:10:00,600
AND ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE

372
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,100
FOR THE NEXT 400 YEARS.

373
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,242
PLASTIC REALLY IS UBIQUITOUS.

374
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:03,900
IT'S IN FOOD PACKAGING,

375
00:10:03,966 --> 00:10:05,066
IT'S IN BUILDING MATERIALS

376
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:06,133
ON PLANES AND CARS,

377
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,233
IT'S IN BICYCLE HELMETS,

378
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,033
AND IT'S IN THIS STRAP-ON

379
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,333
THIGH DILDO.

380
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,200
IMAGINE A WORLD BEFORE PLASTICS,

381
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:13,100
WHEN YOUR FEMUR PENIS WOULD HAVE

382
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:13,866
TO MADE FROM WOOD, OR IF YOU

383
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:18,566
WERE WEALTHY ENOUGH, IVORY.

384
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:19,533
IT DOESN'T BEAR THINKING ABOUT.

385
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,433
BUT FOR ALMOST AS LONG AS

386
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,700
PLASTICS HAVE BEEN AROUND,

387
00:10:21,766 --> 00:10:22,266
THERE'S BEEN THE QUESTION OF

388
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,500
WHAT TO DO WITH THEM AFTER

389
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:24,609
THEY'RE USED... A QUESTION ANY

390
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:25,566
NUMBER OF CREEPY RECYCLING

391
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:26,266
MASCOTS HAVE TRIED TO ANSWER.

392
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,933
FROM THE RECYCLING WIZARD IN

393
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,733
SOUTH CAROLINA, TO RECYCLING BEN

394
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,200
FROM GEORGIA, TO MUNCIE,

395
00:10:31,266 --> 00:10:32,666
INDIANA'S MR. BLUE... WHO

396
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,013
APPEARS TO BE A BAG OF RECYCLING

397
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,186
OR AN ASPHYXIATED SAUSAGE...

398
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:36,333
TO MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE,

399
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,000
TOTES McGOATS.

400
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:39,566
THE POPULAR SOCIAL MEDIA

401
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:41,133
NEWS-SITE MASHABLE WRITES OF

402
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,133
"NIAGARA FALL'S TERRIFYING NEW

403
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,376
RECYCLING MASCOT " AND " HORRIFIC

404
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,133
GOAT-MAN HYBRID."

405
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,900
SURE, YEAH, AND YOU KNOW

406
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:48,100
WHAT?

407
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:48,700
I'VE SEEN CHILDREN CRY AT THE

408
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:49,333
EASTER BUNNY AND SANTA CLAUS AS

409
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,566
WELL.

410
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:54,166
UM, BUT OUR TARGET MARKET ISN'T

411
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:55,633
THREE AND 4-YEAR-OLDS OF COURSE.

412
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,800
IT'S SOMEONE WHO'S LEARNING

413
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:58,933
ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT,

414
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,533
SO MIDDLE SCHOOL, TEENAGERS,

415
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,033
PEOPLE WHO MAYBE AREN'T SO

416
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,200
AFRAID OF GOATS AND CLOWNS.

417
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,333
WELL, HANG ON.

418
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,000
WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT CLOWNS?

419
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:09,900
NO ONE WOULD EVER MISTAKE THAT

420
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:10,433
THING FOR A CLOWN.

421
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,333
I KNOW WE'VE BEEN TOUGH ON

422
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
CLOWNS IN THE PAST.

423
00:11:12,433 --> 00:11:15,033
THEY'RE WEIRD, SCARY, NOT FUNNY,

424
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,900
AND THEY EAT CHILDREN, BUT

425
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:17,800
CREDIT WHERE IT'S DUE... THEY DO

426
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:22,633
PUT IN THE WORK.

427
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,466
YOU THINK A LOOK THIS FRESH

428
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:25,033
JUST COMES TOGETHER?

429
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,900
OF COURSE NOT!

430
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:27,109
THIS GUY CLEARLY MADE AN EFFORT.

431
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:27,766
HE DIDN'T JUST GOOGLE

432
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:28,733
"RUBBER GOAT MASK CHEAP," AND

433
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,000
BUY THE FIRST RESULT, WHICH,

434
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:30,566
INCIDENTALLY, SEEMS TO BE

435
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:31,800
THE EXACT MASK THAT FUCKED-UP

436
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:32,666
GOAT IS WEARING.

437
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,742
AND WE'VE PRODUCED A LOT OF

438
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:35,100
PLASTIC FOR ALL THOSE MASCOTS

439
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:35,700
TO RECYCLE.

440
00:11:35,766 --> 00:11:36,842
SINCE PLASTIC'S INTRODUCTION,

441
00:11:36,866 --> 00:11:37,933
PRODUCTION HAS SKYROCKETED

442
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,166
TO 380 MILLION TONS IN 2015.

443
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,966
IN FACT, HALF OF ALL PLASTICS

444
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:42,866
EVER MADE HAVE BEEN PRODUCED

445
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:45,900
SINCE 2005.

446
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:47,866
AND FOR ALL THE HYPE ABOUT

447
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:50,100
RECYCLING, A LOT LESS PLASTIC

448
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,600
WINDS UP GETTING RECYCLED THAN

449
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:52,700
YOU MIGHT THINK.

450
00:11:52,766 --> 00:11:55,033
LESS THAN 9% OF THE PLASTICS

451
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,766
GENERATED ARE RECYCLED

452
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:57,766
IN THE UNITED STATES,

453
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:58,966
WITH THE VAST MAJORITY

454
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:00,366
ENDING UP IN LANDFILLS OR

455
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:01,566
IN THE ENVIRONMENT.

456
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:02,366
BUT BEFORE YOU START BLAMING

457
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:04,366
YOURSELF, OR YOUR NEIGHBORS,

458
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,033
FOR NOT SORTING THEIR TRASH AND

459
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,666
SEPARATING ITEMS, IT'S ACTUALLY

460
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:09,066
NOT THAT SIMPLE, AS THIS

461
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:09,933
REPORTER FOUND OUT WHILE WALKING

462
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,833
THROUGH A PORTLAND SUPERMARKET.

463
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,633
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY IS

464
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,809
BUYING LETTUCE IN A BOX NOW.

465
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,166
IS THIS RECYCLABLE?

466
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:16,666
IN THIS STATE, NONE OF THIS

467
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:17,333
IS... NONE OF THIS IS

468
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:17,833
RECYCLABLE.

469
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,500
OKAY.

470
00:12:18,566 --> 00:12:19,666
WHAT ABOUT ALL OF THESE?

471
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:20,400
THIS IS EVERYWHERE IN EVERY

472
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:22,666
SUPERMARKET.

473
00:12:22,733 --> 00:12:24,033
IN OREGON, AGAIN, THERE ARE

474
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,466
NO CURBSIDE PROGRAMS THAT WOULD

475
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:27,400
ACCEPT ANY OF THESE TUBS.

476
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:29,000
YEAH, THAT IS SHOCKING!

477
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:30,533
BECAUSE THINK OF WHAT THAT

478
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,300
THE STUFF WE ALL

479
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:33,666
ROUTINELY BUY AT THE SUPERMARKET

480
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:35,333
...ASSUMING, UNDERSTANDABLY, IT

481
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,680
WILL GET RECYCLED... IS, IN MANY

482
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:38,333
CASES, NOT.

483
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,566
AND THAT IS DESPITE THE

484
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,000
IMPRESSION WE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN

485
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:41,933
FROM MASCOTS LIKE TOTES McGOATS,

486
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,233
WHOSE NAME I'M HONESTLY

487
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,342
UNCOMFORTABLE EVEN UTTERING OUT

488
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:45,833
LOUD, JUST ON THE OFF-CHANCE

489
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,909
THAT HE'S LIKE BEETLEJUICE AND

490
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,033
SAYING "TOTES McGOATS"

491
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,833
THREE TIMES SOMEHOW SUMMONS HIM

492
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,033
INTO...

493
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,933
OH, SHIT!

494
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,033
HOW THE HELL DID YOU GET

495
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,433
IN HERE?

496
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,066
THIS IS A COVID-COMPLIANT SET!

497
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:56,300
YOU CAN'T BE HERE!

498
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:58,866
WAIT... YOU GOT THE VACCINE?

499
00:12:58,933 --> 00:13:00,366
HOW THE FUCK ARE YOU ELIGIBLE

500
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:02,100
FOR THE VACCINE?

501
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:02,966
HYPERTENSION, JOHN.

502
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,400
OH, BULLSHIT!

503
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:05,066
YOU KNOW WHAT?

504
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:05,866
I DON'T CARE!

505
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:08,933
YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE!

506
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,600
GET OUT OF HERE!

507
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,709
YOU'RE SO MUCH WORSE IN PERSON,

508
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:11,133
TOTES!

509
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,300
YOU LOOK LIKE A FURRY

510
00:13:12,366 --> 00:13:13,000
WHO CAN'T COMMIT.

511
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:14,533
GET OUT OF HERE!

512
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,300
THE FACT IS, A HUGE AMOUNT OF

513
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:17,933
THE PLASTIC SURROUNDING US

514
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,133
ISN'T RECYCLED BECAUSE IT'S

515
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,500
NOT REALLY RECYCLABLE.

516
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:22,833
AND THAT MEANS IT ENDS UP IN

517
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,533
LANDFILLS, OR BURNT, OR IN THE

518
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,366
OCEAN, WHERE IT BREAKS DOWN INTO

519
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:28,033
"MICRO-PLASTICS," GET EATEN BY

520
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,166
FISH, AND CAN END UP INSIDE US.

521
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:31,100
PLASTIC IN THE OCEAN HAS A

522
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,900
TENDENCY TO BREAK DOWN INTO EVER

523
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:34,100
SMALLER PIECES.

524
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,166
AND THESE TINY PIECES THEN GET

525
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,166
TAKEN UP EVEN LOWER DOWN

526
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,100
IN THE FOOD CHAIN.

527
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,066
SO WE KNOW THAT IT ENDS UP ON

528
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:42,033
OUR DINNER PLATES.

529
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,033
THERE IS PLASTIC IN YOUR FOOD,

530
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,233
PLASTIC IN YOUR SEA SALT,

531
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,200
AND PLASTIC COMING OUT OF YOUR

532
00:13:49,266 --> 00:13:49,833
TAP.

533
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,633
IT'S TRUE.

534
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,600
A RECENT STUDY EVEN ESTIMATED

535
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,033
THAT AN AVERAGE PERSON GLOBALLY

536
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,500
COULD BE INGESTING ABOUT A

537
00:13:57,566 --> 00:13:58,300
CREDIT CARD'S WORTH OF PLASTIC

538
00:13:58,366 --> 00:13:59,526
INTO THEIR SYSTEM EVERY WEEK.

539
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:00,566
WHICH KIND OF EXPLAINS

540
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,366
CAPITAL ONE'S NEW SLOGAN,

541
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:02,366
"WHAT'S IN YOUR STOMACH?"

542
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:04,766
GOOD QUESTION, MR. JACKSON.

543
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:05,266
BECAUSE APPARENTLY, IT'S

544
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,066
1.5% CASH BACK, A FEW THOUSAND

545
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:07,033
FREE AIRLINE MILES, AND A

546
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,566
FUCKING SHITLOAD OF PLASTIC.

547
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:11,533
SO HOW IS IT THAT TONS OF

548
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,233
PLASTIC THAT WE ASSUME IS

549
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,900
GETTING RECYCLED CAN INSTEAD

550
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:19,100
SOMETIMES END UP INSIDE OF US?

551
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,700
WELL, THAT IS WHAT THIS STORY IS

552
00:14:20,766 --> 00:14:20,900
ABOUT.

553
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:22,109
IT'S ABOUT WHY SO LITTLE PLASTIC

554
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:23,933
GETS RECYCLED, THE HARM THAT

555
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:24,766
CAN DO, AND HOW THE PLASTICS

556
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:25,766
INDUSTRY HAS MANAGED TO CONVINCE

557
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,333
US ALL THAT IT'S OUR FAULT.

558
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,100
AND LET'S START WITH SOME

559
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,100
HISTORY.

560
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,066
AS PLASTIC PRODUCTION

561
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:32,033
BEGAN TO GROW IN THE 1950s,

562
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,600
SO DID PLASTIC WASTE, AND

563
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:34,742
THEREFORE, PUBLIC BACKLASH.

564
00:14:34,766 --> 00:14:35,933
BY THE '60s AND '70s,

565
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,300
ORGANIZATIONS BEGAN DRAWING

566
00:14:37,366 --> 00:14:38,476
ATTENTION TO ALL THE PACKAGING

567
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,733
WASTE LITTERING THE LANDSCAPE,

568
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,666
THROUGH ADS LIKE THIS ONE.

569
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:44,433
SOME PEOPLE HAVE A DEEP,

570
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,266
ABIDING RESPECT FOR THE NATURAL

571
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,266
BEAUTY THAT WAS ONCE THIS

572
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,866
COUNTRY.

573
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:53,000
AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T.

574
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:55,100
PEOPLE START POLLUTION.

575
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:58,666
PEOPLE CAN STOP IT.

576
00:14:58,733 --> 00:14:59,533
NOW YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN

577
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,933
THAT AD BEFORE.

578
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,333
IT REALLY TOUCHED PEOPLE'S

579
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,542
HEARTSTRINGS, BECAUSE APPARENTLY

580
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:05,533
THE WORST THING WHITE PEOPLE

581
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,500
EVER DID TO AMERICA'S INDIGENOUS

582
00:15:06,566 --> 00:15:07,800
POPULATIONS WAS LITTER ON THE

583
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:08,733
FREEWAY.

584
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,809
BUT THERE ARE A FEW MISLEADING

585
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:10,733
THINGS ABOUT IT.

586
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,166
FIRST, THAT MAN WASN'T ACTUALLY

587
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:13,342
NATIVE AMERICAN... HE WAS AN

588
00:15:13,366 --> 00:15:14,166
ITALIAN-AMERICAN ACTOR WHO

589
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:15,400
PLAYED THEM FOR A LIVING.

590
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:16,800
AND WHILE IT'S BY NO MEANS

591
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:17,800
THE FIRST TIME SOMEONE OF

592
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:18,966
ITALIAN DESCENT INSERTED

593
00:15:19,033 --> 00:15:20,500
THEMSELVES INTO A

594
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:21,500
NATIVE AMERICAN NARRATIVE

595
00:15:21,566 --> 00:15:22,500
WITHOUT ASKING, I GUESS AT LEAST

596
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:24,200
THIS TIME NO ONE NAMED A HOLIDAY

597
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:24,766
AFTER HIM.

598
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,333
BUT MORE TO THE POINT,

599
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,766
THE ORGANIZATION THAT PRODUCED

600
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,566
THAT AD, KEEP AMERICA BEAUTIFUL,

601
00:15:29,633 --> 00:15:31,766
WAS FUNDED IN PART BY A PLASTICS

602
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,200
INDUSTRY TRADE GROUP, AND

603
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,200
COMPOSED OF LEADING BEVERAGE AND

604
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,266
PACKAGING CORPORATIONS.

605
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,542
WHICH MIGHT SEEM ODD, UNTIL YOU

606
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:39,900
REALIZE THAT THE UNDERLYING

607
00:15:39,966 --> 00:15:40,466
MESSAGE THERE IS,

608
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:41,766
"IT'S UP TO YOU, THE CONSUMER,

609
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,566
TO STOP POLLUTION."

610
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:45,166
AND THAT HAS BEEN A MAJOR

611
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:46,353
THROUGHLINE IN THE RECYCLING

612
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,200
MOVEMENT... A MOVEMENT OFTEN

613
00:15:48,266 --> 00:15:49,933
BANKROLLED BY COMPANIES WHO

614
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,009
WANTED TO DRILL HOME THE MESSAGE

615
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,300
THAT IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY

616
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:53,966
TO DEAL WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL

617
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:56,100
IMPACT OF THEIR PRODUCTS.

618
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,133
AND NOWHERE IS THIS CO-OPTING OF

619
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,209
ENVIRONMENTALISM CLEARER THAN

620
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:00,473
WITH THAT RECYCLING SYMBOL THAT

621
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,576
YOU FIND ON PLASTIC PRODUCTS YOU

622
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,609
BUY... THE FAMOUS "CHASING

623
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:03,700
ARROWS."

624
00:16:03,766 --> 00:16:06,033
THEY ARE ON EVERYTHING,

625
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,033
AND THE NUMBERS INSIDE THEM ARE

626
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,366
PRETTY IMPORTANT, BECAUSE THEY

627
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:09,166
REPRESENT WHAT TYPE OF PLASTIC

628
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:10,000
IT IS.

629
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:12,466
NUMBER 1 STANDS FOR P.E.T.

630
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:14,633
THINK WATER AND SODA BOTTLES.

631
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,800
NUMBER 2 IS HDPE, OFTEN USED AS

632
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:17,946
PACKAGING FOR DETERGENT AND

633
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,833
SHAMPOO.

634
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,166
THEN, THERE'S 3, 4, 5, 6, AND

635
00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:24,300
WILD CARD NUMBER 7, WHICH STANDS

636
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:24,966
FOR OTHER... MEANING EVERYTHING

637
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:27,133
ELSE.

638
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,566
RIGHT, NUMBER 7 IS

639
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:29,966
BASICALLY THE CATCH-ALL FOR

640
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:31,666
"EVERYTHING ELSE," IN THE SAME

641
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:32,666
WAY THAT THAT ONE DRAWER

642
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:33,533
IN YOUR KITCHEN IS A CATCH-ALL

643
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,666
FOR EVERYTHING.

644
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:36,266
YEAH, THERE'S KETCHUP PACKETS,

645
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,800
BUT ALSO, RUBBER BANDS,

646
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:38,909
THE INSTRUCTIONS TO AN IMMERSION

647
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:40,233
BLENDER YOU LOST A YEAR AGO,

648
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,133
AND A POST-IT NOTE WITH JUST

649
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,066
A PHONE NUMBER ON IT AND

650
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:43,533
NO INDICATION WHO IT BELONGS TO.

651
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,500
CALL THAT NUMBER!

652
00:16:44,566 --> 00:16:47,133
I DARE YOU!

653
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,000
BUT CRUCIALLY, VERY FEW OF THOSE

654
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:50,400
SEVEN TYPES OF PLASTIC ARE

655
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:52,733
COMMONLY RECYCLABLE.

656
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,009
CERTAIN TYPES OF NUMBER 1 AND 2

657
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:55,400
PLASTICS... THINGS LIKE SODA AND

658
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:59,100
LAUNDRY DETERGENT BOTTLES... DO

659
00:16:59,166 --> 00:16:59,433
GET RECYCLED.

660
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,100
ALTHOUGH, DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU

661
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,066
LIVE, CERTAIN OTHER TYPES...

662
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:02,373
LIKE THOSE LETTUCE TUBS YOU SAW

663
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:04,166
EARLIER... MAY NOT.

664
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:05,766
AND WHEN IT COMES TO PLASTICS

665
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,566
NUMBERS 3 THROUGH 7... WHICH CAN

666
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:08,933
BE THINGS LIKE PLASTIC BAGS,

667
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,042
CUPS, OR POUCHES... WE HAVE THE

668
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:11,300
CAPACITY TO RECYCLE LESS THAN

669
00:17:11,366 --> 00:17:14,133
5% OF IT.

670
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,033
SO OUT OF THE SEVEN NUMBERS,

671
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,933
ONLY TWO ARE REALLY MUCH GOOD.

672
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,633
AND THAT IS A PRETTY BAD RATIO

673
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,700
FOR A GROUP OF SEVEN.

674
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:22,466
IDEALLY, YOU'D WANT A BALANCE

675
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:23,833
A LITTLE MORE LIKE BTS.

676
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,766
THERE'S NOT A WEAK LINK IN THAT

677
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,033
UNBREAKABLE CHAIN OF

678
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,300
HEARTTHROBS.

679
00:17:27,366 --> 00:17:29,133
WITH SO MANY PEOPLE ONSTAGE,

680
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,900
YOU'D UNDERSTAND IF SOMETIMES

681
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,733
JIMIN ONLY GAVE 50%,

682
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,300
BUT HE DOESN'T, HE BEATS UP

683
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:34,233
THE DANCE FLOOR EVERY NIGHT

684
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,133
LIKE HE JUST CAUGHT IT

685
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,500
ROBBING HIS HOUSE.

686
00:17:36,566 --> 00:17:37,900
AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

687
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:38,733
REASONS WHY CERTAIN PLASTICS

688
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,166
DON'T GET RECYCLED.

689
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,200
SOME ARE COMPLEX MIXES OF

690
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:43,600
DIFFERENT RESINS, MAKING

691
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,733
RECYCLING THEM DIFFICULT.

692
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,666
OTHER TIMES, THERE ARE PRACTICAL

693
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,466
OBSTACLES... THAT THE PLASTIC IS

694
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:49,066
CONTAMINATED, OR DIFFICULT TO

695
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:50,000
SORT.

696
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:52,966
AND THEN THERE ARE ECONOMIC

697
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:53,766
REASONS... SOMETIMES, THERE'S

698
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:54,400
NO MARKET FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF

699
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:55,666
PLASTIC.

700
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:56,666
AND RIGHT NOW, IT'S CHEAPER FOR

701
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:57,809
COMPANIES TO MAKE VIRGIN PLASTIC

702
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,166
THAN FOR THEM TO RECYCLE IT.

703
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:02,000
BUT THE THING IS, DESPITE

704
00:18:02,066 --> 00:18:03,566
KNOWING THAT MOST PLASTICS

705
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:05,433
CAN'T BE RECYCLED, THE INDUSTRY

706
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,576
LOBBIED STATE LEGISLATURES TO

707
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,000
PASS LAWS REQUIRING THAT CHASING

708
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:10,500
ARROWS SYMBOL TO BE PLACED ON

709
00:18:10,566 --> 00:18:12,000
ALL OF THEIR CONTAINERS,

710
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:13,900
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY COULD

711
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:16,866
ACTUALLY BE RECYCLED OR NOT.

712
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:17,866
MANUFACTURERS AND COMPANIES

713
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:19,233
LIKE COCA-COLA ALSO LOBBIED

714
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,366
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO INVEST

715
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,576
IN CURBSIDE RECYCLING PROGRAMS,

716
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,733
EVEN THOUGH, BEHIND DOORS,

717
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,266
ONE INDUSTRY INSIDER

718
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,609
ACKNOWLEDGED AS FAR BACK AS 1974

719
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:29,066
THAT, "THERE IS SERIOUS DOUBT

720
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:30,309
THAT RECYCLING PLASTIC CAN EVER

721
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,033
BE MADE VIABLE ON AN ECONOMIC

722
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,633
BASIS."

723
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,066
AND HONESTLY, IT WASN'T ALL THAT

724
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:37,333
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO CONVINCE

725
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,033
US THAT ALL THEIR WASTE IS

726
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,466
RECYCLABLE, BECAUSE WE SO BADLY

727
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:42,700
WANT TO BELIEVE IT.

728
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:43,966
LIES GO DOWN EASIER WHEN YOU

729
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:45,166
WANT THEM TO BE TRUE.

730
00:18:45,233 --> 00:18:47,033
IN FACT, OUR DESIRE FOR THINGS

731
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,266
TO BE RECYCLED IS SO STRONG THAT

732
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,900
PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE INDUSTRY

733
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,566
EVEN HAVE A SPECIAL TERM FOR IT.

734
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,233
A LOT OF THINGS REALLY AREN'T

735
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,000
RECYCLABLE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH

736
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:57,066
WE WANT THEM TO BE.

737
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:58,566
PEOPLE JUST WANT TO THROW,

738
00:18:58,633 --> 00:18:59,866
YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING IN AND,

739
00:18:59,933 --> 00:19:00,666
YOU KNOW, THEY WISH IT WAS

740
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:01,500
RECYCLING.

741
00:19:01,566 --> 00:19:02,609
SO WE CALL IT "WISHCYCLING."

742
00:19:02,633 --> 00:19:03,100
HERE'S SOME "WISHCYCLING"

743
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,333
FOR YOU.

744
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,733
HERE'S AN UMBRELLA.

745
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,566
I WISH IT WAS RECYCLABLE.

746
00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:11,200
IT'S NOT.

747
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:12,933
NOW, FIRST OFF,

748
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,042
HE'S RIGHT THAT UMBRELLAS ARE

749
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:16,633
NOT RECYCLABLE, WHICH IS A PITY,

750
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,600
AS THE AVERAGE AMERICAN GOES

751
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:18,200
THROUGH ROUGHLY 4,000 OF THEM

752
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:19,100
A YEAR.

753
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,366
I'VE ALREADY SOMEHOW LOST 12

754
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:21,642
SO FAR THIS YEAR, AND IT DOESN'T

755
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:22,666
EVEN RAIN IN THIS VOID.

756
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:24,933
AND SECONDLY, THE TERM

757
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,666
"WISHCYCLING" IS JUST TOO GOOD

758
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,233
TO BE WASTED ON GARBAGE.

759
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,933
"WISHCYCLING" SOUNDS LIKE

760
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,966
A SPIN CLASS TAUGHT BY A

761
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:32,933
UNICORN, OR THE SEWAGE TREATMENT

762
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,766
SYSTEM AT HOGWARTS.

763
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,366
"AND THIS, CHILDREN, IS WHERE

764
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:37,673
WE WISHCYCLE ALL YOUR COLLECTED

765
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,700
URINE INTO THIS DELICIOUS

766
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:40,233
BUTTERBEER!

767
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,000
OH, IT'S FINE, CALM DOWN, IT'S

768
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:45,366
MAGIC, STOP CRYING, IT'S FINE."

769
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:46,542
BUT WISHCYCLING CAN END UP DOING

770
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:48,166
REAL HARM.

771
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:49,766
BECAUSE AT BEST, NON-RECYCLABLE

772
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:50,909
ITEMS CAN BE A HASSLE TO REMOVE.

773
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:53,566
PLANTS OFTEN HAVE TO STOP

774
00:19:53,633 --> 00:19:55,733
MACHINES TO CUT OUT ALL OF

775
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,966
THE PLASTIC BAGS THAT PEOPLE

776
00:19:57,033 --> 00:19:57,833
DESPERATELY WANT TO THINK THEY

777
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,300
CAN HANDLE.

778
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,366
AND AT WORST, THEY CAN END UP

779
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:02,333
CONTAMINATING LOADS OF PLASTICS

780
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,266
THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE

781
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,966
RECYCLED.

782
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:06,433
SO THE FALSE IMPRESSION WE'VE

783
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,900
ALL BEEN GIVEN THAT ALL

784
00:20:07,966 --> 00:20:10,333
THE PLASTICS WE'RE PUTTING INTO

785
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,100
THE RECYCLING ARE BEING

786
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:12,733
RECYCLED IS VERY MUCH

787
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,066
NOT THE CASE.

788
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:15,466
AND FOR A FEW BLISSFUL DECADES,

789
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:17,100
AMERICA AND MOST OF THE WORLD

790
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,166
DIDN'T REALLY WORRY ABOUT THIS,

791
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:20,566
BECAUSE WE SIMPLY SHIPPED MUCH

792
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:22,033
OF THE LOWER-QUALITY PLASTIC

793
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,800
WASTE WE COULDN'T USE, IN BULK,

794
00:20:22,866 --> 00:20:23,900
TO CHINA.

795
00:20:23,966 --> 00:20:25,466
AT ONE POINT, ROUGHLY 70% OF

796
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:26,400
THE WORLD'S PLASTIC WASTE WENT

797
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:28,400
THERE.

798
00:20:28,466 --> 00:20:30,400
BUT THAT STOPPED IN 2018, WHEN

799
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:32,200
CHINA FLAT-OUT BANNED THE IMPORT

800
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:33,966
OF MOST PLASTICS.

801
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,500
AND SINCE THEN, MUCH OF OUR

802
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:37,066
WASTE HAS BEEN LEFT TO EITHER

803
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:38,176
PILE UP IN DOMESTIC RECYCLING

804
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,833
PLANTS WITH NO ONE TO BUY IT OR

805
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,233
SHIPPED OUT TO OTHER COUNTRIES

806
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,000
IN ASIA, WHERE IT CAN GET

807
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:44,176
DROPPED INTO LANDFILLS, LIKE

808
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,300
THIS ONE IN MALAYSIA.

809
00:20:46,366 --> 00:20:46,933
LOOK AT HOW BIG THIS IS.

810
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,166
JUST TAKE A LOOK.

811
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:52,233
LOOK HOW FAR IT GOES.

812
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,200
THIS IS JUST ONE DUMP.

813
00:20:55,266 --> 00:20:57,333
ONE DUMP.

814
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,066
A VAST FIELD OF PLASTIC.

815
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,600
TWO STORIES HIGH.

816
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,600
SEE IF WE CAN LOOK ON THE

817
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,066
BACK HERE, "MARYSVILLE, OHIO."

818
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:06,600
THIS IS FROM ITALY,

819
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,666
PENNSYLVANIA, NEW YORK.

820
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:10,300
LOOK, WALMART BAG.

821
00:21:10,366 --> 00:21:11,900
YEAH, A LOT OF OUR

822
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:13,076
PLASTIC JUST ENDS UP SITTING

823
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,033
IN GIANT LANDFILLS ON THE OTHER

824
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,733
SIDE OF THE WORLD.

825
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,133
SO I GUESS KATY PERRY'S

826
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,100
QUESTION, "DO YOU EVER FEEL

827
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,933
LIKE A PLASTIC BAG DRIFTING

828
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,333
THROUGH THE WIND, WANTING TO

829
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,166
START AGAIN?"

830
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:23,166
SHOULD REALLY BE, "DO YOU EVER

831
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:24,166
FEEL LIKE A PLASTIC WALMART BAG

832
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:26,166
DROWNING IN TWO STORIES OF

833
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:27,500
SOCIETY'S UNMITIGATED FILTH?"

834
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:28,300
AND SINCE YOU'RE ASKING... YEAH,

835
00:21:28,366 --> 00:21:29,833
KATY, I DO.

836
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,200
ALL THE TIME.

837
00:21:32,266 --> 00:21:33,800
AND THE PROBLEM IS, THOSE

838
00:21:33,866 --> 00:21:35,300
COUNTRIES DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE

839
00:21:35,366 --> 00:21:36,700
THE CAPABILITIES TO DEAL WITH

840
00:21:36,766 --> 00:21:38,466
THEIR OWN PLASTIC WASTE, LET

841
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:39,866
ALONE MILLIONS OF TONS OF OURS.

842
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:41,633
WHICH CAN HAVE SERIOUS

843
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,266
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE HEALTH AND

844
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,733
SAFETY OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE.

845
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,800
IN MALAYSIA, SOME OPERATIONS ARE

846
00:21:45,866 --> 00:21:46,976
ILLEGALLY INCINERATING LOTS OF

847
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,166
PLASTIC WASTE.

848
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:49,100
AND JUST LISTEN TO THIS

849
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,326
COMMUNITY ACTIVIST DESCRIBING

850
00:21:50,366 --> 00:21:53,200
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE NEARBY.

851
00:21:53,266 --> 00:21:54,100
THE AIR POLLUTION BECOMES

852
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,666
VERY SERIOUS IN MY VILLAGE.

853
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:58,500
THE BURNING CAUSED A LOT OF

854
00:21:58,566 --> 00:21:59,933
RESPIRATORY DISEASE PROBLEMS

855
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,066
TO OUR PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY OUR

856
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:03,966
CHILDREN AND OUR ELDERLY, WHO

857
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:05,866
HAS THIS PROBLEM OF REPEATING

858
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:06,766
ASTHMA, REPEATING COUGHING

859
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:07,966
ALSO.

860
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:09,866
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

861
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:11,076
AND I HAVE TO SAY, THERE'S JUST

862
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,233
NO WAY THAT THE PEOPLE

863
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,376
RESPONSIBLE FOR BURNING THAT

864
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:13,966
WASTE DON'T KNOW THE FUMES ARE

865
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,533
TOXIC.

866
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,400
WHEN YOU SMELL BURNING PLASTIC,

867
00:22:17,466 --> 00:22:18,476
YOU DON'T THINK, "OOH, THAT

868
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,200
SMELLS GREAT.

869
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:21,400
IS SOMEONE BAKING COOKIES?"

870
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:24,033
YOU THINK, "MY NOSE SEEMS TO BE

871
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,033
DYING AND IT'S TAKING MY BRAIN

872
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,300
DOWN WITH IT."

873
00:22:26,366 --> 00:22:27,966
NOW, THE GOOD NEWS IS, MORE THAN

874
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:30,100
180 COUNTRIES AGREED LAST YEAR

875
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:31,566
TO PLACE STRICT LIMITS ON

876
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:32,866
EXPORTS OF PLASTIC WASTE FROM

877
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:36,233
RICHER COUNTRIES TO POORER ONES.

878
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,100
THE BAD NEWS IS THAT,

879
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,100
THE UNITED STATES IS ONE OF THE

880
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:43,466
FEW COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD THAT

881
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:44,233
DIDN'T RATIFY THAT GLOBAL BAND.

882
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,233
AND THE THING IS,

883
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,066
WHEN PLASTIC ISN'T

884
00:22:46,133 --> 00:22:47,133
BURNED, IT CAN END UP IN

885
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,209
LANDFILLS OR IN THE ENVIRONMENT.

886
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,100
ACROSS THE WORLD, MORE THAN

887
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,066
EIGHT MILLION TONS END UP

888
00:22:50,133 --> 00:22:51,066
IN OUR OCEANS EVERY YEAR.

889
00:22:51,133 --> 00:22:52,342
THERE'S FAMOUSLY EVEN A SWIRLING

890
00:22:52,366 --> 00:22:53,766
GARBAGE PATCH OF MICROPLASTIC

891
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:55,166
WASTE IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN,

892
00:22:55,233 --> 00:22:56,100
SPREAD OUT OVER AN AREA THAT IS

893
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,066
"BIGGER THAN FRANCE, GERMANY,

894
00:22:57,133 --> 00:22:58,500
AND SPAIN COMBINED."

895
00:22:58,566 --> 00:23:00,733
AND BY 2050, THE OCEAN IS

896
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,466
EXPECTED TO CONTAIN, BY WEIGHT,

897
00:23:02,533 --> 00:23:06,033
MORE PLASTICS THAN FISH.

898
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,633
THAT IS ALL FISH.

899
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,900
THAT INCLUDES THE RED SNAPPER,

900
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:09,533
SALMON, AND, OF COURSE

901
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,609
THE BLOB FISH, THE ONLY FISH

902
00:23:10,633 --> 00:23:14,466
WITH A FACE THAT SCREAMS

903
00:23:14,533 --> 00:23:17,566
"I WOULD BE VOICED BY

904
00:23:17,633 --> 00:23:20,933
RICHARD KIND IN A PIXAR MOVIE

905
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,433
AND HE WOULD ABSOLUTELY

906
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,133
NAIL IT."

907
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,066
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, BLOB FISH?

908
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:24,400
OH, ABSOLUTELY, JOHN, 100%!

909
00:23:24,466 --> 00:23:24,833
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME!

910
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,933
I'M A BLOB FISH!

911
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,600
I'M SLURP THE BLOB FISH!

912
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:27,800
OF COURSE YOU'RE CALLED

913
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:28,466
SLURP!

914
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:29,433
THAT IS SOME SPOT ON CASTING

915
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,433
RIGHT THERE.

916
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,366
WELL, I'D ONLY BE A

917
00:23:32,433 --> 00:23:33,000
SUPPORTING CHARACTER, BUT, LOOK,

918
00:23:33,066 --> 00:23:33,733
WITH THIS FACE?

919
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,366
YOU KNOW DAMN WELL I'M GONNA

920
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:35,533
STEAL THE SHOW.

921
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,700
I KNOW YOU WILL, SLURP!

922
00:23:36,766 --> 00:23:38,133
I WOULD PROVIDE COMIC RELIEF

923
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,466
THROUGHOUT A VERY FUN, YET

924
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:41,533
INTERMITTENTLY TOUCHING FILM.

925
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,066
AND WORD HAS IT THERE'S GONNA

926
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:45,066
BE AT LEAST TWO SEQUELS.

927
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,733
AND JOHN?

928
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,400
ENTRE NOUS?

929
00:23:50,466 --> 00:23:50,833
YES?

930
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,700
I DIE AT THE END OF

931
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:53,033
THE THIRD ONE!

932
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,700
BUT DON'T WORRY, I'VE GOT PROFIT

933
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:54,133
PARTICIPATION!

934
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
GOOD FOR YOU, SLURP!

935
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,333
GET THAT MONEY.

936
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,266
AND FRUSTRATINGLY, THE PLASTICS

937
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:00,700
INDUSTRY'S RESPONSE TO ALL THE

938
00:24:00,766 --> 00:24:01,700
DAMAGE YOU'VE SEEN HAS BEEN

939
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:03,933
TO MAKE A BIG SHOW OF TINY

940
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,109
IMPROVEMENTS, AND THEN REVERT

941
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:06,300
TO WHAT THEY'VE ALWAYS DONE,

942
00:24:06,366 --> 00:24:08,500
WHICH IS HEAVILY PUSH THE IDEA

943
00:24:08,566 --> 00:24:14,766
THAT IF WE AS CONSUMERS SIMPLY

944
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:15,942
TRIED HARD ENOUGH, WE COULD MAKE

945
00:24:15,966 --> 00:24:17,009
OUR PLASTIC PROBLEM GO AWAY.

946
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:17,866
KEEP AMERICA BEAUTIFUL...

947
00:24:17,933 --> 00:24:18,866
THE PEOPLE BEHIND THAT FAKE

948
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:20,042
NATIVE AMERICAN AD... IS STILL

949
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:21,433
AROUND, MAKING DUMB COMMERCIALS

950
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,100
LIKE THIS ONE, WHERE A BOTTLE

951
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,433
GOES ON A LONG, INSPIRING

952
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,433
JOURNEY TO A RECYCLING BIN AND

953
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,400
ENDS UP FULFILLING ITS DREAM OF

954
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:27,000
BECOMING A BENCH.

955
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:29,066
AND IF BOTTLES WERE SENTIENT,

956
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:29,833
I'D GENUINELY BE SURPRISED IF

957
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,133
THEIR BIGGEST DREAM WAS

958
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,100
"I WISH OLD PEOPLE WOULD PLAY

959
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:37,166
CHESS WHILE SITTING ON MY FACE."

960
00:24:37,233 --> 00:24:38,100
BUT I WILL SAY, AT LEAST

961
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:39,066
THEY'RE BEING HONEST THERE THAT

962
00:24:39,133 --> 00:24:40,176
THE BOTTLE BECAME A BENCH AND

963
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,200
THEN NOTHING ELSE.

964
00:24:41,266 --> 00:24:41,933
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, ONLY ABOUT

965
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,933
2% OF ALL RECYCLED PLASTIC WINDS

966
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,333
UP IN A SO-CALLED CLOSED-LOOP

967
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,266
SYSTEM, WHERE IT BECOMES THE

968
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:48,966
THING IT ORIGINALLY WAS,

969
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:50,309
IN OTHER WORDS, A BOTTLE GETTING

970
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:51,566
RECYCLED AND BECOMING A BOTTLE

971
00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:58,400
AGAIN.

972
00:24:58,466 --> 00:25:01,433
INSTEAD, MOST RECYCLED PLASTIC

973
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,133
GETS "DOWNCYCLED" TO

974
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,333
BECOME A CARPET,

975
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,466
OR A FLEECE SWEATSHIRT, OR

976
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:05,666
INDEED, A BENCH, AND IT THEN

977
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:06,166
CAN'T BE RECYCLED AGAIN.

978
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:07,433
AND YET DESPITE THIS FACT,

979
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,800
COMPANIES LIKE NESTLE WATER HAVE

980
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:09,876
GONE OUT OF THEIR WAY TO MAKE

981
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,233
ADS INDICATING THAT IF WE JUST

982
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,133
DID OUR PART, PLASTICS COULD BE

983
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,100
PUT INTO CONTINUOUS REUSE, LIKE

984
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:17,266
THIS AD FROM 2012.

985
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:21,833
NATURE HAS A BIOLOGICAL

986
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,766
METABOLISM WHERE ONE THING'S

987
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:23,633
WASTE BECOMES ANOTHER THING'S

988
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,200
FOOD.

989
00:25:24,266 --> 00:25:26,466
SO IF I LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE

990
00:25:26,533 --> 00:25:28,500
A PLASTIC BOTTLE, I DON'T SEE

991
00:25:28,566 --> 00:25:30,700
WASTE, I SEE A NUTRIENT.

992
00:25:30,766 --> 00:25:32,766
THIS IS RAW MATERIAL?

993
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:35,233
SO IF THIS IS RAW MATERIAL,

994
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:35,833
PEOPLE NEED TO START THINKING

995
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,966
ABOUT IT THAT WAY.

996
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:38,042
IT COULD COME BACK AS A

997
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:39,933
BOTTLE, OF COURSE.

998
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,933
WE ONLY HAVE TO MAKE THIS

999
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,333
VIRGIN MATERIAL ONE TIME.

1000
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,833
AND THE REST OF IT'S UP TO YOU.

1001
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,633
WE GET THE BOTTLE BACK, WE'LL

1002
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,533
MAKE THIS BOTTLE OUT OF RECYCLED

1003
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,166
CONTENT AGAIN.

1004
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:53,566
WELL, THAT SOUNDS

1005
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:54,633
AMAZING!

1006
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:57,533
UNFORTUNATELY, WHAT THAT

1007
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,680
EXECUTIVE BOARD KEN DOLL IS

1008
00:25:58,733 --> 00:25:59,966
SUGGESTING THERE IS COMPLETE

1009
00:26:00,033 --> 00:26:01,233
BULLSHIT.

1010
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,133
BECAUSE NESTLE WATER DOESN'T,

1011
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,500
IN FACT, HAVE TO MAKE VIRGIN

1012
00:26:03,566 --> 00:26:05,200
PLASTIC JUST "ONE TIME" IF YOU

1013
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:05,800
SIMPLY GIVE YOUR BOTTLE BACK.

1014
00:26:05,866 --> 00:26:06,466
AND THE REASON WE KNOW THAT IS,

1015
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:07,733
EVEN EIGHT YEARS AFTER THAT AD

1016
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,633
AIRED, ONLY 20% OF THE PLASTIC

1017
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,200
THEY USE WAS RECYCLED, MEANING

1018
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:14,733
80% WAS FROM VIRGIN MATERIAL.

1019
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,400
SO THAT'S THE MOST OBVIOUS

1020
00:26:17,466 --> 00:26:18,900
OVERSTATEMENT IN AN AD SINCE

1021
00:26:18,966 --> 00:26:21,233
THIS ONE FOR GAMEBOY IN THE '90s

1022
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:21,666
THAT CLAIMED IT WAS

1023
00:26:21,733 --> 00:26:22,333
"MORE FUN THAN A FERRET DOWN

1024
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,800
YOUR TROUSERS."

1025
00:26:23,866 --> 00:26:25,233
THAT AD IS REAL.

1026
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,342
AND I'M SORRY, MARIO, BUT NO,

1027
00:26:26,366 --> 00:26:28,266
YOU'RE NOT MORE FUN.

1028
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:29,453
NOT IF THE FERRET KNOWS WHAT

1029
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,066
IT'S DOING.

1030
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:34,866
AND THE CRAZY THING IS,

1031
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:36,333
THAT COMPANY ACTUALLY HAS

1032
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,000
A BETTER TRACK RECORD THAN MANY

1033
00:26:37,066 --> 00:26:37,900
OTHER BRANDS WHEN IT COMES TO

1034
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,766
THIS.

1035
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:39,909
THAT IS HOW BAD THINGS ARE.

1036
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:41,200
TAKE COCA-COLA.

1037
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,200
BRAND AUDITS OF OF PLASTIC WASTE

1038
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:43,276
COLLECTED AT CLEANUPS HAVE

1039
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,580
CONSISTENTLY FOUND COKE PRODUCTS

1040
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:45,742
AS THE NUMBER ONE TOP GLOBAL

1041
00:26:45,766 --> 00:26:47,933
POLLUTER.

1042
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,600
WHICH IS DAMNING.

1043
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:50,933
AND PROBABLY WHY COKE HAS BEEN

1044
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,433
SO ANXIOUS TO MAKE SPLASHY

1045
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
PROMISES WE ALL SO BADLY

1046
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,333
WANT TO HEAR,

1047
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,833
LIKE PLEDGING TO USE AT LEAST

1048
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,566
50% RECYCLED MATERIAL IN THEIR

1049
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:03,433
PACKAGING BY 2030.

1050
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,542
WHICH DOES SOUNDS REALLY GOOD.

1051
00:27:04,566 --> 00:27:05,833
THE PROBLEM IS, COKE HAS BEEN

1052
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,400
MAKING AND BREAKING PROMISES

1053
00:27:06,466 --> 00:27:08,400
LIKE THAT FOR DECADES.

1054
00:27:08,466 --> 00:27:09,900
OVER THE YEARS, THEY'VE

1055
00:27:09,966 --> 00:27:12,733
REPEATEDLY, LOUDLY LAUNCHED BIG

1056
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,700
RECYCLED-PLASTIC INITIATIVES

1057
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:20,433
THAT THEY THEN QUIETLY

1058
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,000
ABANDONED WITH NO ONE REALLY

1059
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:21,833
NOTICING.

1060
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,633
IN 2009, THEY ANNOUNCED PLANS

1061
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,933
TO SOURCE 25% OF THEIR PLASTIC

1062
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,700
FROM RECYCLED MATERIAL BY 2015.

1063
00:27:27,766 --> 00:27:28,366
EXCEPT YOU'LL NOTICE THAT

1064
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:29,366
IT'S SIX YEARS PAST THAT

1065
00:27:29,433 --> 00:27:29,933
DEADLINE, AND THEIR CURRENT

1066
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
PROPORTION IS JUST 10%.

1067
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,733
SO I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF,

1068
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,133
BY 2030, THE MAIN THING COKE IS

1069
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,533
RECYCLING IS THE SAME BULLSHIT

1070
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,000
PROMISES IT'S BEEN MAKING FOR

1071
00:27:37,066 --> 00:27:40,100
YEARS.

1072
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:44,566
AND LOOK, ON A PERSONAL LEVEL,

1073
00:27:44,633 --> 00:27:45,466
I KNOW THIS CAN FEEL

1074
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:46,233
DEMORALIZING,

1075
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,900
BECAUSE IT CAN SEEM THAT

1076
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:48,400
RECYCLING IS POINTLESS.

1077
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:49,033
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT

1078
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,800
IT'S NOT.

1079
00:27:49,866 --> 00:27:50,866
WE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY KEEP

1080
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,076
RECYCLING PAPER, CARDBOARD, AND

1081
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,600
ALUMINUM.

1082
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:55,133
AND EVEN RECYCLING PLASTIC...

1083
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,033
WHILE IT MIGHT BE 90% MORE

1084
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,300
POINTLESS THAN YOU ASSUMED...

1085
00:27:58,366 --> 00:27:59,433
CAN STILL HAVE MODEST

1086
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,633
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS.

1087
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,466
ALTHOUGH, WE SHOULD DO IT MORE

1088
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:05,133
MINDFULLY... YOU SHOULD CHECK

1089
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,766
WITH YOUR LOCAL MUNICIPALITY TO

1090
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:06,909
SEE WHAT TYPES OF PLASTIC THEY

1091
00:28:06,933 --> 00:28:07,566
ACCEPT, AND THEN ONLY RECYCLE

1092
00:28:07,633 --> 00:28:08,533
THOSE.

1093
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,266
OTHERWISE, REMEMBER, YOU COULD

1094
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:11,866
END UP CONTAMINATING USABLE

1095
00:28:11,933 --> 00:28:13,533
MATERIALS.

1096
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,866
AND AS A GOOD RULE, DEFINITELY

1097
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:17,733
DON'T "WISHCYCLE" THINGS LIKE

1098
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,033
UMBRELLAS, BECAUSE THERE'S A

1099
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,380
NONZERO CHANCE THAT YOU'RE GOING

1100
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:20,833
TO END UP ANGERING

1101
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,933
TOTES McGOATS.

1102
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,433
OH, SHIT.

1103
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:22,866
NO.

1104
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:23,800
NO.

1105
00:28:23,866 --> 00:28:25,433
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

1106
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,633
NO.

1107
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,333
LEAVE THIS PLACE.

1108
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,566
NO!

1109
00:28:32,633 --> 00:28:33,900
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,

1110
00:28:33,966 --> 00:28:35,400
OUR PERSONAL BEHAVIOR IS

1111
00:28:35,466 --> 00:28:40,433
NOT THE MAIN CULPRIT HERE,

1112
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,500
DESPITE WHAT THE PLASTICS

1113
00:28:44,566 --> 00:28:45,642
INDUSTRY HAS SPENT DECADES,

1114
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:46,233
AND MILLIONS OF

1115
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,500
DOLLARS TRYING TO CONVINCE US.

1116
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:48,166
SO YES, WE SHOULDN'T BE USING

1117
00:28:48,233 --> 00:28:49,233
SINGLE-USE PLASTICS LIKE

1118
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,166
GROCERY BAGS OR TAKE-OUT

1119
00:28:50,233 --> 00:28:51,466
CONTAINERS... REDUCING THAT

1120
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:52,300
WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE, AS

1121
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:53,700
NEARLY HALF OF THE PLASTIC WASTE

1122
00:28:53,766 --> 00:28:54,333
GENERATED GLOBALLY IN 2015 WAS

1123
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,542
PLASTIC PACKAGING, MOST OF IT

1124
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:56,866
SINGLE USE.

1125
00:28:56,933 --> 00:28:58,000
BUT IT CAN BE HARD, ON AN

1126
00:28:58,066 --> 00:29:00,066
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL, TO END THEIR

1127
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:00,233
USE.

1128
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,233
A BETTER MOVE WOULD BE TO

1129
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,033
IMPLEMENT SMART, THOUGHTFUL,

1130
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,500
TARGETED BANS THAT FORCE THE

1131
00:29:04,566 --> 00:29:06,200
INTRODUCTION OF ALTERNATIVES.

1132
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:08,766
AND TO THEIR CREDIT, MANY CITIES

1133
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:10,066
HAVE BANNED SINGLE-USE PLASTIC

1134
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:11,666
BAGS.

1135
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:15,700
UNFORTUNATELY, THE INDUSTRY HAS

1136
00:29:15,766 --> 00:29:17,266
FOUGHT THOSE BANS HARD,

1137
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:17,866
EVEN LOBBYING SOME STATE

1138
00:29:17,933 --> 00:29:19,000
LEGISLATURES, TO THE

1139
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:20,533
POINT THAT EIGHTEEN STATES NOW

1140
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,500
HAVE PREEMPTIVE LAWS STOPPING

1141
00:29:21,566 --> 00:29:23,600
LOCAL REGULATION.

1142
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:24,233
WHICH IS A BIT WEIRD.

1143
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,442
I GUESS THOSE STATES JUST HAVE

1144
00:29:25,466 --> 00:29:26,609
A HARD-ON FOR PLASTIC BAGS NOT

1145
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:28,066
SEEN SINCE THAT CREEPY KID FROM

1146
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:32,933
"AMERICAN BEAUTY."

1147
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,933
THE KID LOVED.

1148
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,142
SO WHAT CAN WE REALLY DO HERE?

1149
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:36,900
WELL, THE REAL BEHAVIOR CHANGE

1150
00:29:36,966 --> 00:29:37,966
HAS TO COME FROM PLASTICS

1151
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:39,400
MANUFACTURERS THEMSELVES.

1152
00:29:39,466 --> 00:29:40,766
WITHOUT THAT, NOTHING

1153
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:42,800
SIGNIFICANT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

1154
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:44,700
WE HAVE TO MAKE THEM INTERNALIZE

1155
00:29:44,766 --> 00:29:45,666
THE COSTS OF THE POLLUTION THAT

1156
00:29:45,733 --> 00:29:47,300
THEY ARE CREATING.

1157
00:29:47,366 --> 00:29:48,900
AND THERE IS A WAY TO DO THIS,

1158
00:29:48,966 --> 00:29:50,000
THROUGH A CONCEPT CALLED

1159
00:29:50,066 --> 00:29:51,166
"EXTENDED PRODUCER

1160
00:29:51,233 --> 00:29:52,066
RESPONSIBILITY" OR

1161
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:54,133
"THE POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE."

1162
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,966
THE IDEA IS TO CREATE LAWS

1163
00:29:55,033 --> 00:29:56,600
THAT ESSENTIALLY SHIFT

1164
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:57,709
RESPONSIBILITY, AND THE COSTS OF

1165
00:29:57,733 --> 00:29:59,166
COLLECTION, FROM THE PUBLIC

1166
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:00,433
SECTOR AND ALL OF US TO THE

1167
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,233
ACTUAL PRODUCERS OF THE PLASTIC

1168
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,966
WASTE.

1169
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:04,200
EPR LAWS COULD, AMONG OTHER

1170
00:30:04,266 --> 00:30:06,166
THINGS, FORCE COMPANIES TO

1171
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:07,866
EITHER CREATE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

1172
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:08,973
AND MARKETS TO RECYCLE THE

1173
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,400
PRODUCTS THEY MAKE, OR FORCE

1174
00:30:10,466 --> 00:30:11,266
THEM TO STOP MAKING THEM

1175
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:12,800
ALTOGETHER.

1176
00:30:12,866 --> 00:30:14,333
THE U.S. IS ONE OF THE ONLY

1177
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,266
DEVELOPED COUNTRIES ON EARTH

1178
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:17,633
WITHOUT A NATIONAL EPR LAW

1179
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,566
ADDRESSING PACKAGING.

1180
00:30:19,633 --> 00:30:21,200
BECAUSE OF COURSE IT IS.

1181
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:23,133
BUT ON THE POSITIVE SIDE,

1182
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,100
SEVERAL STATES ARE CURRENTLY

1183
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:25,733
CONSIDERING EPR LAWS, AND THERE

1184
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,400
WAS EVEN A NATIONAL LAW

1185
00:30:27,466 --> 00:30:28,746
INTRODUCED IN THE LAST CONGRESS.

1186
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,600
IT WENT NOWHERE, BUT IT'LL SOON

1187
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:33,066
BE INTRODUCED AGAIN, AND WE'RE

1188
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:34,376
GOING TO NEED SOME VERSION OF AN

1189
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,166
EPR LAW TO PASS, AND SOON.

1190
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:37,466
BECAUSE THIS PROBLEM'S GETTING

1191
00:30:37,533 --> 00:30:39,566
WORSE.

1192
00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:41,333
PLASTIC PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED

1193
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,366
TO TRIPLE BY 2050.

1194
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:45,133
AND IT'S OBVIOUS THAT MEANINGFUL

1195
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,400
CHANGE IS ONLY GOING TO COME

1196
00:30:46,466 --> 00:30:49,433
THROUGH BEING ABLE TO FORCE

1197
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,833
THIS VERY POWERFUL INDUSTRY TO

1198
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,909
DO THINGS THAT IT'S SHOWN FOR

1199
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,700
HALF A CENTURY IT HAS ABSOLUTELY

1200
00:30:53,766 --> 00:30:56,766
NO INTEREST IN DOING.

1201
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:58,266
WE HAVE TO MAKE THEM CHANGE...

1202
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:00,733
AND IF NOT FOR OUR SAKE, OR THE

1203
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,666
SAKE OF FUTURE GENERATIONS,

1204
00:31:01,733 --> 00:31:02,666
LET'S AT LEAST DO IT FOR ALL

1205
00:31:02,733 --> 00:31:04,666
THE FISH WHO ARE ABOUT TO BE

1206
00:31:04,733 --> 00:31:05,166
OUTNUMBERED BY PLASTIC

1207
00:31:05,233 --> 00:31:06,466
IN THE OCEAN.

1208
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:07,800
JUST LIKE ME!

1209
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,966
AIN'T THAT RIGHT, JOHN?

1210
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:10,466
EXACTLY, SLURP,

1211
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:13,033
JUST LIKE YOU!

1212
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,109
THAT'S OUR SHOW, THANK YOU SO

1213
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:14,766
MUCH FOR WATCHING.

1214
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:15,366
WE'RE OFF NEXT WEEK, SO WE'LL

1215
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:15,933
SEE YOU IN TWO WEEKS' TIME.

1216
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,700
A HIATUS?

1217
00:31:16,766 --> 00:31:17,633
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?

1218
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,200
ALREADY?

1219
00:31:18,266 --> 00:31:19,266
JESUS.

1220
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,833
GOD ALMIGHTY, JOHN.

1221
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,400
C'MON, JOHN, BUCKLE DOWN.

1222
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:23,966
YOU'VE GOT MORE WRITERS THAN

1223
00:31:24,033 --> 00:31:25,900
THE JONESTOWN MASSACRE.

1224
00:31:25,966 --> 00:31:26,700
MY GOD!

1225
00:31:26,766 --> 00:31:29,566
SLURP, IT'S A VERY

1226
00:31:29,633 --> 00:31:30,033
INTENSIVE PRODUCTION.

1227
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,000
OUR STAFF IS ENTITLED

1228
00:31:32,066 --> 00:31:32,300
TO A BREAK.

1229
00:31:32,366 --> 00:31:33,133
SEE YOU ALL APRIL 4th.

1230
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,433
GOOD NIGHT!

1231
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:33,966
HEY!

1232
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:35,200
LOOK AT ME, EVERYBODY!

1233
00:31:35,266 --> 00:31:36,376
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

1234
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,442
YOU'RE THINKING I LOOK LIKE

1235
00:31:37,466 --> 00:31:38,300
SOMETHING ANOTHER FISH COUGHED

1236
00:31:38,366 --> 00:31:39,166
UP.

1237
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:40,133
HUH?

1238
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,533
THAT MY HEAD LOOKS LIKE A BASKET

1239
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,666
INGREDIENT FROM "CHOPPED."

1240
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:44,466
YEAH, OKAY.

1241
00:31:44,533 --> 00:31:45,766
TO EVERYBODY OUT THERE

1242
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:46,842
ON THE INTERNET WHO SAID I LOOK

1243
00:31:46,866 --> 00:31:48,066
LIKE TED CRUZ, REMEMBER:

1244
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:49,366
I GOT FEELINGS.

1245
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:50,766
AND YOU'VE HURT THEM.

1246
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:51,400
GOOD NIGHT.

1247
00:31:51,466 --> 00:31:52,933
I LOVE YOU ALL.

1248
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,800
MIAMI BEACH IS THE GREATEST

1249
00:31:54,866 --> 00:31:56,566
AUDIENCE IN THE WORLD!

1250
00:31:56,633 --> 00:31:57,733
MWAH!

1251
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,800
GOOD NIGHT!
