1
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:29,366
HI THERE!

2
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:30,366
WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

3
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:31,233
STILL, UNFORTUNATELY,

4
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,442
TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK VOID.

5
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:33,500
TOMORROW IS ACTUALLY

6
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:34,633
THE VOID'S BIRTHDAY.

7
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,260
SO, HAPPY ONE YEAR, VOID!

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,300
I'VE NEVER SAID THIS TO

9
00:00:37,366 --> 00:00:38,800
A ONE-YEAR-OLD BEFORE,

10
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:39,266
BUT I SINCERELY HOPE

11
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,800
YOU STOP EXISTING SOON!

12
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:41,966
IT'S BEEN A VERY BUSY WEEK.

13
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:43,042
WE MARKED THE ANNIVERSARY OF

14
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:44,133
CHET HANKS TELLING US HIS

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,766
PARENTS WERE "NOT TRIPPIN" OVER

16
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,233
THEIR CORONAVIRUS DIAGNOSES, A

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,633
BIDDER SPENT NEARLY $70 MILLION

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,300
ON A JPEG CREATED BY AN ARTIST

19
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:52,566
CALLED BEEPLE... A STRING OF

20
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:53,876
WORDS THAT APPARENTLY MAKE SENSE

21
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,600
...AND LAST SUNDAY,

22
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,333
MEGHAN MARKLE AND HER UNEMPLOYED

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,600
HUSBAND OPENED UP ABOUT

24
00:00:58,666 --> 00:00:59,966
RACISM IN THE ROYAL FAMILY.

25
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:02,033
IT WAS AN INTERVIEW SO SHOCKING,

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,342
IT MERITED NOT ONE, NOT TWO, BUT

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,033
THREE DRAMATIC OPRAH "WHAT?" S,

28
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,309
AND OF ALL THE IDIOTIC RESPONSES

29
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:07,833
...FROM MEGYN KELLY CALLING

30
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,466
MARKLE DEFENDERS

31
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:12,366
"PATERNALISTIC WOKESTERS" TO

32
00:01:12,433 --> 00:01:13,673
PIERS MORGAN WALKING OFF SET...

33
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:15,933
THIS WAS PERHAPS THE BOLDEST.

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,300
I WOULD PUT IT TO YOU:

35
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:19,833
NOBODY IN THE WORLD, IN HISTORY,

36
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,033
HAS DONE MORE FOR PEOPLE OF

37
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,533
COLOR THAN THE BRITISH

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,866
ROYAL FAMILY.

39
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:24,300
WOW.

40
00:01:24,366 --> 00:01:25,766
THE WORD "FOR" THERE IS THE

41
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,900
ABSOLUTE WORST PREPOSITION.

42
00:01:27,966 --> 00:01:28,733
ALMOST ANY OTHER WOULD BE

43
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,833
BETTER.

44
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,233
"NOBODY IN THE WORLD HAS DONE

45
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,966
MORE TO PEOPLE OF COLOR THAN

46
00:01:33,033 --> 00:01:33,866
THE BRITISH ROYAL FAMILY?"

47
00:01:34,874 --> 00:01:35,741
SURE.

48
00:01:35,766 --> 00:01:36,926
"NOBODY IN THE WORLD HAS DONE

49
00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:38,166
MORE THROUGH PEOPLE OF COLOR

50
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:39,166
THAN THE BRITISH ROYAL FAMILY?"

51
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:40,466
ABSOLUTELY.

52
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:41,733
EVEN "NOBODY IN THE WORLD HAS

53
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,466
DONE MORE ABOVE PEOPLE OF COLOR

54
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:44,709
THAN THE BRITISH ROYAL FAMILY"

55
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:46,000
WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE, AND TO

56
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:46,966
ILLUSTRATE THAT, I'M SIMPLY

57
00:01:47,033 --> 00:01:47,833
GOING TO PRESENT THIS PICTURE

58
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,800
WITH NO FURTHER COMMENTARY AND

59
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:49,766
YOU CAN TELL ME WHETHER THAT

60
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,866
SENTENCE STANDS UP OR NOT.

61
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:53,566
I WOULD SAY THAT WAS THE MOST

62
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:54,233
RIDICULOUS CLAIM MADE THIS WEEK,

63
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,666
BUT HERE IN NEW YORK,

64
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:57,100
GOVERNOR CUOMO RESPONDED TO

65
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,176
THE GROWING NUMBER OF WOMEN

66
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,666
ACCUSING HIM OF HARASSMENT...

67
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:00,973
INCLUDING A NEW INCIDENT THAT'S

68
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:02,193
BEEN REFERRED TO POLICE... BY

69
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:03,766
CALLING A PRESS CONFERENCE

70
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,266
TO DENY THOSE CLAIMS, AND

71
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,000
SPECULATING ABOUT WHY MANY

72
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:08,366
IN HIS PARTY HAVE CALLED

73
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:10,000
FOR HIS RESIGNATION.

74
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:10,900
PART OF THIS IS THAT I AM NOT

75
00:02:10,966 --> 00:02:13,133
PART OF THE POLITICAL CLUB.

76
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,733
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

77
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,133
I'M PROUD OF IT.

78
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,100
YEAH.

79
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,442
THAT'S THE FORMER HUD SECRETARY,

80
00:02:19,466 --> 00:02:21,066
FORMER NEW YORK ATTORNEY

81
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:22,033
GENERAL, CURRENT CHAIR OF THE

82
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,500
NATIONAL GOVERNOR'S ASSOCIATION,

83
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:26,166
AND SON OF A THREE-TERM

84
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:27,513
GOVERNOR, CLAIMING HE'S NOT PART

85
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:28,966
OF "THE POLITICAL CLUB."

86
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:29,533
IT'S LIKE HEARING

87
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,766
DAVID MISCAVIGE SAY HE'S

88
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,266
NOT A PART OF THE SCIENTOLOGY

89
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:35,466
CLUB.

90
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:36,066
YES, YOU ARE.

91
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:36,866
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY FALSE,

92
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:37,633
WE KNOW WHERE HIS HEART IS,

93
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,366
WHICH IS A LOT MORE THAN WE CAN

94
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:39,466
SAY ABOUT HIS WIFE.

95
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:40,000
WHERE'S SHELLY, DAVID?

96
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:40,866
WHERE'S SHELLY?

97
00:02:40,933 --> 00:02:42,900
I'M SURE SHE'S FINE.

98
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:44,533
BUT THE BIGGEST NEWS THIS WEEK

99
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
WAS THE PASSAGE OF THE

100
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,742
$1.9 TRILLION AMERICAN RESCUE

101
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:47,833
PLAN.

102
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,966
THE PASSING OF IT IS A VERY BIG

103
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:51,700
DEAL, AS IT INVOLVES... AMONG

104
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:53,266
OTHER THINGS... DIRECT PAYMENTS

105
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,166
OF $1400 TO MANY AMERICANS.

106
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:56,833
WHICH IS WHY IT IS SO STRANGE

107
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,566
THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS CHAIR OF

108
00:02:58,633 --> 00:03:01,166
THE DNC DECIDED TO CELEBRATE IT

109
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:04,166
BY TWEETING THIS.

110
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:09,900
OH, HI.

111
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,700
NO.

112
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:32,066
THERE IS SIMPLY NO THEMATIC OR

113
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:33,293
CONCEPTUAL REASON TO USE THAT

114
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,000
SCENE.

115
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:35,233
START WITH THE FACT THAT THE

116
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,342
VIDEO WAS POSTED ON MARCH 10TH,

117
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:37,200
AND DEPENDING ON WHICH DIRECTION

118
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:38,342
YOU'RE GOING, THAT'S EITHER

119
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:39,500
290 DAYS BEFORE, OR 75 DAYS

120
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:41,666
AFTER CHRISTMAS.

121
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:42,809
ALSO, WHY WOULD EITHER OF THESE

122
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:43,976
PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THE STIMULUS

123
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,100
BILL?

124
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,400
THEY LIVE IN LONDON!

125
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:48,933
AND WHO ARE THEY EVEN MEANT

126
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,933
TO REPRESENT IN REGARDS TO IT?

127
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,833
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE

128
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,200
KIERA KNIGHTLY?

129
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:53,266
IS THIS GUY NANCY PELOSI?

130
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,633
AND IF SO, WHO IS THE HUSBAND IN

131
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,909
THE OTHER ROOM WE'RE SUPPOSED TO

132
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:57,266
BE HIDING THIS INTERACTION FROM?

133
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,166
I MEAN, YEAH, I'M PRETTY

134
00:03:58,233 --> 00:03:59,633
CONFIDENT THE ELECTED OFFICIAL

135
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,700
HOUNDING A STAFFER IS

136
00:04:00,766 --> 00:04:02,000
ANDREW CUOMO,

137
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:03,233
BUT OTHER THAN THAT, NOTHING

138
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,866
MAKES SENSE HERE.

139
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:06,400
AND THE THING IS, THE CONTENT

140
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:07,700
OF THIS BILL IS REALLY WORTH

141
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:08,966
KNOWING ABOUT.

142
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,276
BECAUSE WHILE IT DOESN'T CONTAIN

143
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,200
A $15 MINIMUM WAGE AND THE

144
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:14,066
STIMULUS PAYMENTS ARE ONLY

145
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,566
$1400 INSTEAD OF $2,000,

146
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:16,742
THERE IS STILL SOME GOOD STUFF

147
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:18,300
IN HERE.

148
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:19,900
THERE'S MONEY FOR SCHOOLS AND

149
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:20,700
CITIES TO HANDLE THE PANDEMIC,

150
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:22,006
EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS,

151
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:23,466
AND FOR MOST PARENTS, THERE'S

152
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:24,833
THIS.

153
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,566
MAYBE MOST CRITICAL IN HERE

154
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,100
IS THE CHILD TAX CREDIT.

155
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,066
IT'S A GUARANTEED INCOME

156
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:30,433
FOR THE YEAR FOR

157
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,700
LOW-INCOME FAMILIES.

158
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:33,966
REGULAR DIRECT DEPOSITS

159
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:35,466
FROM THE GOVERNMENT INSTEAD OF

160
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:37,200
A LUMP SUM AT TAX TIME.

161
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:39,400
YEAH, IT'S UP TO

162
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:41,866
$3600 PER CHILD, WHICH IS HUGE.

163
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:44,366
IT'S CURRENTLY JUST FOR THE

164
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:45,866
YEAR, BUT IT REALLY SHOULD BE

165
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:47,666
PERMANENT... EXPERTS SAY IF THAT

166
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:49,100
HAPPENS, IT COULD ACTUALLY CUT

167
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,233
CHILD POVERTY BY MORE THAN HALF.

168
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,733
IT'S POTENTIALLY ONE OF THE MOST

169
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,666
SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN THE BILL

170
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:56,700
AND IT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE

171
00:04:56,766 --> 00:04:57,966
BOOST FOR PARENTS, WHO FRANKLY

172
00:04:58,033 --> 00:04:59,033
DESERVE IT AFTER

173
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,333
SPENDING THE PAST YEAR STUCK

174
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,442
IN THE SAME PLACE WITH THEIR

175
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:02,333
KIDS 24 HOURS A DAY.

176
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,442
I'M JUST SAYING, YOU TRY BEING

177
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:05,266
BODY SHAMED BY A FIVE-YEAR-OLD

178
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,200
WHO KEEPS ASKING YOU WHY YOUR

179
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:07,100
ARM HAIR GROWS ALL FUNKY.

180
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:07,900
IT JUST DOES!

181
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:13,100
I DON'T KNOW!

182
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:13,566
IT GROWS THAT WAY!

183
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:14,366
YOU'RE MAKING ME

184
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:15,466
SELF-CONSCIOUS ABOUT IT!

185
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:16,300
AND WHILE THE PASSING OF THIS

186
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:17,476
BILL MIGHT NOW SEEM INEVITABLE,

187
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,540
BECAUSE IT PASSED, AND HAD

188
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:21,100
70% SUPPORT FROM THE AMERICAN

189
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,176
PEOPLE, IT ONLY HAPPENED BECAUSE

190
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,633
THE DEMOCRATS WON GEORGIA AND

191
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,233
NOW CONTROL THE SENATE.

192
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:25,900
AND EVEN THEN, THEY HAD TO GET

193
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:27,333
PARTS OF IT PAST

194
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,233
DIET REPUBLICANS JOE MANCHIN AND

195
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,800
KYRSTEN SINEMA.

196
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:32,500
BECAUSE REPUBLICANS THEMSELVES

197
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:33,833
WERE HEAVILY AGAINST THIS.

198
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,633
THIS ISN'T A RESCUE BILL.

199
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,866
IT ISN'T A RELIEF BILL.

200
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:39,100
IT'S A LAUNDRY LIST OF LEFT-WING

201
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,400
PRIORITIES.

202
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:41,700
IT IS A TROJAN HORSE FOR

203
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:43,033
SOCIALISM.

204
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,276
IT IS EVERYTHING DEMOCRATS HAVE

205
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,200
WANTED, WRAPPED AND BRANDED IN

206
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:48,033
CORONAVIRUS SO THAT PEOPLE ARE

207
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,700
SCARED INTO VOTING FOR IT.

208
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,000
THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY AND

209
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:53,533
A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.

210
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,700
I THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY

211
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:56,133
ONE OF THE WORST PIECES OF

212
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,440
LEGISLATION I'VE SEEN PASS HERE

213
00:05:57,466 --> 00:05:58,366
IN THE TIME I'VE BEEN IN THE

214
00:05:58,433 --> 00:05:59,733
SENATE.

215
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,100
WHAT?

216
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,000
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN IN THE SENATE

217
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:04,833
FOR 600 YEARS, BUT GIVING

218
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,333
STRUGGLING AMERICANS BARELY

219
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,666
ENOUGH RENT MONEY AFTER A YEAR

220
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:08,973
OF A FUCKING PANDEMIC IS ONE OF

221
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,133
THE WORST PIECES OF LEGISLATION

222
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
THAT YOU HAVE EVER SEEN?

223
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:18,000
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT, MITCH?

224
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:18,866
NOT THE KNEE-JERK

225
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:20,033
POST-9/11 PANIC PASSING OF

226
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,133
THE PATRIOT ACT,

227
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
OR THE 1986 DRUG BILL

228
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:24,266
THAT MADE A 100 TO ONE

229
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:24,833
SENTENCING DISPARITY BETWEEN

230
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,800
CRACK AND POWDER COCAINE?

231
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:26,533
OR EVEN THE JOINT RESOLUTION

232
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,966
IN 1987 DESIGNATING A

233
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:29,166
"NATIONAL CATFISH DAY."

234
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:30,166
THAT WAS A TOTAL DISGRACE!

235
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:32,166
FUCK YOU, CATFISH!

236
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:32,933
WHICH ARE YOU... CAT?

237
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,833
OR FISH?

238
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,833
PICK A LANE, YOU WHISKERY

239
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,566
ASSHOLES!

240
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:38,466
AND LOOK, IT IS NOT NEWS THAT

241
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:41,600
REPUBLICANS WOULD OPPOSE THIS

242
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:41,800
BILL.

243
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:42,766
WHAT'S SLIGHTLY MORE SURPRISING

244
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,833
IS THAT SOME HAVE HAD THE GALL

245
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,966
TO DO THINGS LIKE THIS.

246
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:47,700
SHORTLY AFTER THE BILL'S

247
00:06:47,766 --> 00:06:48,866
PASSAGE, REPUBLICAN

248
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:50,133
SENATOR ROGER WICKER OF

249
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,900
MISSISSIPPI TWEETED,

250
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:53,466
"INDEPENDENT RESTAURANT

251
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:55,233
OPERATORS HAVE WON $28.6 BILLION

252
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,733
WORTH OF TARGETED RELIEF."

253
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,900
YET WICKER WAS ONE OF

254
00:06:57,966 --> 00:06:59,266
49 REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO

255
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:03,166
VOTED NO ON SATURDAY.

256
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:04,833
YEAH, HE DID THAT.

257
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,600
AND YOU DON'T GET CREDIT FOR

258
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:10,742
SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE KNOWS

259
00:07:10,766 --> 00:07:12,200
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO HAPPEN.

260
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,600
THIS EXACT SAME REASON THAT

261
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,233
PRINCE CHARLES DOESN'T GET TO

262
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,433
TWEET "GREAT INTERVIEW, OPRAH,

263
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,000
YOU TELL THEM, MEGHAN,

264
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:20,833
#MarkleHive."

265
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,076
THE FACT IS, THIS BILL IS GOING

266
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,033
TO HELP MILLIONS OF AMERICANS,

267
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,766
AND IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING

268
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:24,876
THAT EVERY SINGLE REPUBLICAN

269
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,766
OPPOSED IT.

270
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:26,600
AND IF ANY OF THEM EVER COME

271
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,676
BACK AROUND TRYING TO TAKE

272
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,000
CREDIT... TO PUT THIS IN THE

273
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:30,142
FORM THAT I GUESS POLITICAL

274
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:33,633
MESSAGES ARE DELIVERED NOW...

275
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,366
THE RESPONSE HAS TO BE SIMPLY

276
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:35,200
THIS...

277
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:36,433
CHRISTMAS MUSIC, PLEASE!

278
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,433
AND NOW...

279
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,833
LOCAL NEWS BOTHERS 100-YEAR-OLD

280
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,566
WOMEN ON THEIR BIRTHDAYS.

281
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:58,633
DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE?

282
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,833
ADVICE?

283
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,166
DON'T TAKE ANY BALONEY.

284
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:04,733
YOU ARE 100 TODAY.

285
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,133
DON'T EAT VEGETABLES?

286
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,600
I DON'T EAT MUCH CANDY.

287
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,133
WELL, I USED TO EAT A LOT OF

288
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,333
CANDY.

289
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:11,633
NO MORE NOW.

290
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,300
EATING CORRECTLY AND BEHAVING

291
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:14,566
OURSELVES.

292
00:08:14,633 --> 00:08:16,600
AND A LITTLE BETTER BOURBON

293
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:17,933
ON THE SIDE, RIGHT?

294
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,233
OH, YES.

295
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,300
JUST BE YOURSELF.

296
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:23,766
IF THEY WANT TO LAUGH AT YOU,

297
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:24,433
LAUGH BACK AT THEM.

298
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,200
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU

299
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:28,800
ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO IN THIS

300
00:08:28,866 --> 00:08:30,266
NEXT CENTURY OF LIFE?

301
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:30,600
BREATHING.

302
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:31,433
YOU SAY YOU ARE A LITTLE

303
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,066
TIRED THIS MORNING.

304
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:34,400
IS THAT RIGHT?

305
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:35,366
I AM TIRED.

306
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:38,266
ARE YOU EXCITED FOR YOUR

307
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:38,733
PARTY?

308
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,733
NOT ONE BIT.

309
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,666
MOVING ON.

310
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:42,500
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

311
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:43,466
...I'M SORRY TO SAY...

312
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:44,700
TUCKER CARLSON.

313
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:45,700
A MAN WHO GIVES "TUCKERS"

314
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:46,366
AN EVEN WORSE NAME THAN THEY

315
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:47,266
ALREADY HAVE.

316
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,233
THIS WEEK, AS HE SEEMS TO EVERY

317
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,409
WEEK, TUCKER SET OFF A BIT OF

318
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:50,266
A FIRESTORM.

319
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,266
SO WE'VE GOT NEW HAIRSTYLES

320
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,866
AND MATERNITY FLIGHT SUITS,

321
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:54,466
PREGNANT WOMEN ARE GONNA FIGHT

322
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,900
OUR WARS.

323
00:08:55,966 --> 00:08:57,766
IT'S A MOCKERY OF

324
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,466
THE U.S. MILITARY.

325
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:00,542
WHILE CHINA'S MILITARY BECOMES

326
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:01,633
MORE MASCULINE, AS IT'S

327
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,566
ASSEMBLED THE WORLD'S LARGEST

328
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:05,300
NAVY, OUR MILITARY NEEDS TO

329
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:06,376
BECOME, AS JOE BIDEN SAYS, MORE

330
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,900
FEMININE... WHATEVER FEMININE

331
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:08,666
MEANS ANYMORE, SINCE MEN AND

332
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:10,300
WOMEN NO LONGER EXIST.

333
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:11,766
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

334
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:12,833
ABOUT, YOU PERFORMATIVELY

335
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:17,000
OUTRAGED WEDGE SALAD?

336
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:17,900
HE'S PACKED A LOT IN THERE...

337
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:19,009
FROM TRANSPHOBIA, TO WEIRDLY

338
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:20,109
EXTOLLING THE MASCULINITY OF

339
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:21,276
CHINA'S NAVY, TO HIS COMPLETELY

340
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,766
MISPLACED OUTRAGE AT JOE BIDEN

341
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:23,633
OVER THOSE FLIGHT SUITS, WHICH

342
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,933
WERE PART OF AN INITIATIVE

343
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,080
THAT STARTED WHEN TRUMP WAS

344
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:26,666
PRESIDENT, AND ALSO INCLUDED

345
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,000
ENSURING THAT BODY ARMOR

346
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:29,533
ACTUALLY FITS WOMEN SERVICE

347
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,333
MEMBERS, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY

348
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:36,733
A GOOD IDEA.

349
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
THOSE COMMENTS SPARKED AN

350
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:38,700
ALL-TOO-FAMILIAR CYCLE OF

351
00:09:38,766 --> 00:09:39,909
CONDEMNATION, DEFENSIVENESS, AND

352
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:40,400
HYPE.

353
00:09:40,466 --> 00:09:41,626
AND IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY WEEK,

354
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,233
TUCKER HAS ANOTHER ONE OF THESE

355
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,866
MINI-CONTROVERSIES.

356
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:44,566
LAST WEEK IT WAS THE DR. SEUSS

357
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:45,633
BULLSHIT.

358
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,500
AND LOOK, I'D LOVE NOTHING MORE

359
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:47,500
THAN NOT TO PLAY INTO HIS WILDLY

360
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:48,300
OFFENSIVE SHTICK.

361
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:50,233
YOU MIGHT EVEN BE THINKING,

362
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,576
"WHY GIVE HIM THE ATTENTION THAT

363
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,000
HE'S SO CLEARLY TROLLING FOR?"

364
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:54,466
BUT THE FACT IS, WE'RE NOT

365
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:55,776
GIVING TUCKER ANY ATTENTION HE'S

366
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,400
NOT ALREADY GETTING A LOT OF.

367
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:58,766
THE NIGHT HE MADE THOSE FLIGHT

368
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,066
SUIT REMARKS, HE WAS THE MOST

369
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,066
WATCHED SHOW ON CABLE.

370
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:04,133
HE AVERAGES OVER THREE MILLION

371
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,833
VIEWERS A NIGHT, AND DOES WELL

372
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,166
IN THE KEY 25 TO 54 DEMO...

373
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:08,500
MEANING YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

374
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,966
WATCHING HIM, AS WELL AS THE

375
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:11,300
NORMAL FOX AUDIENCE OF RETIREES

376
00:10:11,366 --> 00:10:13,966
AND THEIR SAD, IMPRISONED PETS.

377
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:15,466
HE'S SO IMPORTANT TO THE

378
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,266
NETWORK, THEY'RE EXPANDING HIS

379
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,266
PRESENCE... LAUNCHING A NEW

380
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,166
VIDEO PODCAST AND LONG-FORM

381
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:20,466
DOCUMENTARY SERIES.

382
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:22,000
AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH,

383
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:23,733
TUCKER'S ALSO BEEN FLOATED AS A

384
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,666
POTENTIAL FUTURE PRESIDENTIAL

385
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:26,500
CANDIDATE, WHICH SHOULD BE

386
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:29,100
SERIOUSLY ALARMING, BECAUSE OF

387
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,000
ALL THE THINGS TUCKER IS...

388
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:31,066
A CONSPIRACY THEORIST, A

389
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,300
MISOGYNIST, ISLAMOPHOBIC,

390
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:34,466
A TROLL... ONE OF

391
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,066
THE MOST DANGEROUS IS THAT HE IS

392
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:37,209
THE MOST PROMINENT VESSEL IN

393
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:38,000
AMERICA FOR WHITE SUPREMACIST

394
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:39,966
TALKING POINTS.

395
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:41,900
AND I ALREADY KNOW WHAT TUCKER

396
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:42,466
WILL SAY ABOUT THIS, BECAUSE

397
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:43,366
WHENEVER THE TOPIC COMES UP,

398
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:45,900
HE HAS THE SAME REACTION:

399
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:50,400
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

400
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:51,833
WHITE NATIONALISM.

401
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,933
LET'S BE LITERAL FOR A MINUTE.

402
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,600
WHAT IS THAT EXACTLY?

403
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:55,666
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT

404
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:56,400
WHITE NATIONALIST MEANS AND

405
00:10:56,466 --> 00:10:57,476
I'M NOT GONNA GO DOWN THAT

406
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:57,966
RABBIT HOLE WITH YOU NOW.

407
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,042
WHY DOESN'T ANYONE EVER

408
00:10:59,066 --> 00:10:59,633
DEFINE WHITE SUPREMACY?

409
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,366
WHAT IS WHITE SUPREMACY?

410
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:01,133
CAN SOMEBODY TELL US

411
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,066
IN VERY CLEAR LANGUAGE WHAT

412
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:03,633
A WHITE SUPREMACIST IS?

413
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,166
"VERY

414
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:06,242
CLEAR LANGUAGE" SEEMS LIKE A

415
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,666
HIGH BAR TO CLEAR FOR A MAN WHO

416
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,066
SPENDS 85% OF HIS TIME MAKING

417
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:10,500
THE BEFUDDLED FACE OF A

418
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:11,400
13TH-CENTURY FARMER LEARNING

419
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:13,100
ABOUT BITCOIN.

420
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,333
AND I PROMISE, WE'RE ACTUALLY

421
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,100
GOING TO GIVE TUCKER A PRETTY

422
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:16,866
CLEAR DEFINITION OF WHITE

423
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:18,433
SUPREMACY LATER IN THIS PIECE.

424
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,066
AND HE SEEMS TO NEED ONE,

425
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:21,666
BECAUSE WHENEVER HE TRIES TO

426
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:22,566
DEFINE IT HIMSELF, IT TENDS TO

427
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:24,533
BE SELF-SERVINGLY NARROW.

428
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,900
THIS SHOW WAS NOT ON THE AIR

429
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:26,976
FOR SIX MONTHS BEFORE THERE WAS

430
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,733
AN ORGANIZED AND HIGHLY

431
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,976
AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN BY PROMINENT

432
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,433
DEMOCRATS TO DENOUNCE US AS

433
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,866
WHITE SUPREMACIST.

434
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:34,800
THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED,

435
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:36,333
THE PEOPLE WHO WORK ON THIS

436
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,933
SHOW, MANY OF THEM KIDS, WERE

437
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,700
SHOCKED AND HORRIFIED BY THAT.

438
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:40,900
WHITE SUPREMACISTS?

439
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,733
WHAT'S WORSE THAN THAT?

440
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,633
THE PHRASE EVOKES IMAGES OF

441
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,776
BURNING CROSSES AND LYNCHINGS.

442
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,966
IT'S AWFUL.

443
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:48,800
OKAY, FIRST, I'M SO

444
00:11:48,866 --> 00:11:50,100
SORRY, TUCKER.

445
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,633
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOUR SHOW WAS

446
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,033
STAFFED ENTIRELY BY CHILDREN.

447
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,209
I NEVER INTENDED FOR THEM TO GET

448
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:55,100
CAUGHT UP IN THIS.

449
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,166
SO MY SINCERE APOLOGIES,

450
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,966
YOU TINY LITTLE RASCALS.

451
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:00,333
BUT "I DON'T BURN CROSSES OR

452
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,866
LYNCH PEOPLE, SO I CAN'T BE A

453
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:02,833
WHITE SUPREMACIST" IS A PRETTY

454
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,666
WEAK ARGUMENT.

455
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:06,566
IT'S LIKE SAYING "I CAN'T BE

456
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:08,033
AN ANTI-SEMITE BECAUSE I DIDN'T

457
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,220
DO THE HOLOCAUST" OR I CAN'T

458
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:10,166
BE A SEXUAL PREDATOR

459
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:11,100
BECAUSE I DIDN'T PRODUCE

460
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,300
"GOOD WILL HUNTING."

461
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:13,406
THERE IS MORE THAN ONE WAY

462
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,233
TO BE A TERRIBLE PERSON.

463
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,200
AND TUCKER... CONVENIENTLY FOR

464
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:18,166
HIM... DOESN'T FIT NEATLY INTO

465
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:20,066
A LOT OF PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION OF

466
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:21,333
"WHITE SUPREMACIST."

467
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,233
ESPECIALLY IF THEY SHARE HIS

468
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,466
DEFINITION, THAT IT MUST

469
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:24,666
REQUIRE BURNING CROSSES,

470
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:26,166
KLAN HOODS, AND A NAME TAG

471
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:27,633
THAT SAYS "HELLO, MY NAME IS

472
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,633
A RACIST."

473
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,466
YOU MIGHT EVEN HAVE FRIENDS WHO

474
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:32,400
THINK, "TUCKER CAN'T BE RACIST.

475
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:33,800
I'VE NEVER HEARD HIM SAY THE

476
00:12:33,866 --> 00:12:34,600
"N-WORD," AS IF THAT IS THE

477
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,033
FUCKING BAR.

478
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,300
WHITE

479
00:12:37,366 --> 00:12:38,566
SUPREMACISTS THEMSELVES

480
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:39,800
SEEM TO BE BIG FANS OF WHAT

481
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:41,933
TUCKER'S BEEN DOING.

482
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,333
JUST LISTEN TO DEREK BLACK, A

483
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,133
FORMER WHITE SUPREMACIST WHOSE

484
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,600
FATHER STARTED STORMFRONT

485
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,709
...THE OLDEST, LARGEST WHITE

486
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,266
SUPREMACIST SITE ON THE INTERNET

487
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,833
...TALK ABOUT JUST HOW MUCH HIS

488
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,433
FAMILY LIKES TUCKER'S SHOW.

489
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,733
MY FAMILY WATCHES

490
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,300
TUCKER CARLSON'S SHOW ONCE AND

491
00:12:57,366 --> 00:12:58,766
THEN WATCHES IT ON THE REPLAY

492
00:12:58,833 --> 00:12:59,909
BECAUSE THEY FEEL THAT HE IS

493
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:00,942
MAKING THE WHITE NATIONALIST

494
00:13:00,966 --> 00:13:01,733
TALKING POINTS BETTER THAN THEY

495
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,700
HAVE.

496
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:05,633
AND THEY'RE TRYING TO GET SOME

497
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,266
TIPS ON HOW TO... HOW TO ADVANCE

498
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,533
IT.

499
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,233
YEAH.

500
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:11,566
THEY WATCH IT

501
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:12,533
ONCE TO ENJOY IT, AND A SECOND

502
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
TIME TO LEARN FROM IT.

503
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:14,676
THEY WATCH TUCKER THE SAME WAY I

504
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,842
WATCH "THE DREW BARRYMORE SHOW."

505
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:17,026
FIRST TIME FOR FUN, SECOND TO

506
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:17,633
FIGURE OUT HOW SHE CAN

507
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:18,500
SUCCESSFULLY PULL OFF A SEGMENT

508
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:19,633
IN WHICH A CHILD MAKES A

509
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,600
SHIRLEY TEMPLE WHILE

510
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,876
STANLEY TUCCI QUIETLY DRINKS AN

511
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,500
ENTIRE GLASS OF WINE ON A SCREEN

512
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:23,566
IN THE BACKGROUND.

513
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,400
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WORK YOUR

514
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:25,266
MAGIC, DREW, BUT I WANT TO

515
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,100
LEARN.

516
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,200
YOU'RE ADVANCING THIS FORM!

517
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,400
SO GIVEN THAT TUCKER

518
00:13:29,466 --> 00:13:30,666
HAS THE ADMIRATION OF

519
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:32,066
WHITE SUPREMACISTS, AND THE EAR

520
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:32,866
OF MILLIONS OF YOUR RELATIVES,

521
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:34,566
COWORKERS, AND ELECTED

522
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:36,233
OFFICIALS, WE THOUGHT, TONIGHT,

523
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,066
IT'D BE WORTH TALKING ABOUT HIM

524
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,766
...WHERE HE CAME FROM, WHAT HIS

525
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:39,766
TACTICS ARE, AND WHY WHAT HE

526
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,100
REPRESENTS IS SO DANGEROUS.

527
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,066
AND LET'S START WITH SOME

528
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:43,066
BACK STORY.

529
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:44,366
TUCKER GREW UP IN LA JOLLA,

530
00:13:44,433 --> 00:13:45,733
CALIFORNIA, WHERE HIS DAD

531
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,733
MARRIED AN HEIRESS TO THE

532
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,366
SWANSON TV DINNER FORTUNE.

533
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:50,066
WHICH IS ALREADY INTERESTING.

534
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:52,966
BECAUSE IF TUCKER'S GOT SAD

535
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,700
'70s SINGLE MAN FROZEN FOOD

536
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:57,033
MONEY, THAT MEANS HE'S BEEN

537
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,966
DOING GROUNDBREAKING SHOWS LIKE

538
00:13:58,033 --> 00:13:58,633
"CUCKOLDING IS WHEN A HUMILIATED

539
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,600
MAN WATCHES HIS WIFE HAVE AN

540
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,133
AFFAIR" FOR THE LOVE OF THE

541
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,333
GAME.

542
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,033
TO HEAR TUCKER TELL IT, HE GREW

543
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,633
UP IN A SIMPLER, BETTER TIME.

544
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,400
HE ONCE WISTFULLY CLAIMED,

545
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:06,300
"RACIAL SOLIDARITY WASN'T

546
00:14:06,366 --> 00:14:07,266
A WORKING CONCEPT IN MY

547
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,766
SOUTHERN-CALIFORNIA HOMETOWN.

548
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:09,933
MOST PEOPLE BARELY HAD LAST

549
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
NAMES, MUCH LESS ETHNIC

550
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:12,566
IDENTITIES."

551
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:14,233
WHICH IS A PRETTY WEIRD THING TO

552
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,300
SAY IF YOUR FULL NAME IS

553
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:17,900
TUCKER SWANSON McNEAR CARLSON,

554
00:14:17,966 --> 00:14:19,086
AND YOUR ETHNIC IDENTITY CAN

555
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:20,366
BEST BE DESCRIBED AS

556
00:14:20,433 --> 00:14:21,333
"MY BROTHER'S NAME IS

557
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,166
BUCKLEY SWANSON PECK CARLSON."

558
00:14:23,233 --> 00:14:24,533
THE ONLY WAY HE COULD GET ANY

559
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,533
MORE ETHNICALLY WHITE IS IF HE

560
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,566
JIZZED MAYONNAISE.

561
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:30,300
AS A CHILD, TUCKER WAS SENT TO

562
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:31,533
BOARDING SCHOOL, WHERE HE

563
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,066
PROMPTLY DID TWO THINGS:

564
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:34,333
FAIL TO IMPRESS ANY NUMBER OF

565
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,133
PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITIES AND

566
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,933
START DATING THE HEADMASTER'S

567
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,233
DAUGHTER, A HEADMASTER WHO IN

568
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,200
RETURN, ARRANGED TO GET HIM

569
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:41,266
INTO TRINITY COLLEGE.

570
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,400
HE THEN BECAME A PRINT

571
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,166
JOURNALIST, REPORTEDLY AFTER HIS

572
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:44,966
FATHER TOLD HIM THAT JOURNALISM

573
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:46,133
WILL "TAKE ANYBODY."

574
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,633
WHICH, TO HIS DAD'S CREDIT,

575
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,809
DID KIND OF TURN OUT TO BE TRUE.

576
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,400
TUCKER'S LEAP TO TV, THOUGH,

577
00:14:51,466 --> 00:14:52,833
CAME AS AN ACCIDENT...

578
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,333
SUPPOSEDLY, BACK IN THE '90s,

579
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,300
DAN RATHER'S SHOW CALLED

580
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:56,566
THE MAGAZINE WHERE TUCKER WAS

581
00:14:56,633 --> 00:14:57,466
WORKING, LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY

582
00:14:57,533 --> 00:14:58,676
TO TALK ABOUT THE O.J. TRIAL.

583
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,266
AND THE RECEPTIONIST THERE TOLD

584
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:00,900
HIM, "EVERYONE ELSE IS STILL AT

585
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:01,866
LUNCH.

586
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:03,200
CAN YOU DO IT?"

587
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:05,633
WHICH MIGHT BE THE SINGLE

588
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,566
WHITEST ORIGIN STORY I HAVE EVER

589
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:07,400
HEARD.

590
00:15:07,466 --> 00:15:08,466
"HEY, YOU!

591
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,300
YEAH, YOU WITH THE SKIN AND

592
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,133
FACE!

593
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,133
WE'VE GOT AN EXTRA CAREER LYING

594
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,700
AROUND.

595
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:13,600
ARE YOU INTERESTED?"

596
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:14,833
BUT DESPITE HIS TOTAL LACK OF

597
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,100
PREPARATION, TUCKER WAS ALMOST

598
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:17,700
IMMEDIATELY HITTING ON THEMES

599
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:18,700
THAT HE'D BE ECHOING FOR THE

600
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:20,666
NEXT 25 YEARS.

601
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:22,133
BECAUSE HERE'S ONE OF HIS VERY

602
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,320
FIRST TV APPEARANCES, IN THE

603
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:25,266
AFTERMATH OF THE O.J. VERDICT.

604
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,133
LET ME ASK YOU, MR. CARLSON,

605
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,376
DO YOU THINK WE'RE HONEST WITH

606
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,500
EACH OTHER?

607
00:15:28,566 --> 00:15:30,566
OH, NO, OF COURSE NOT.

608
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:33,133
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY IS

609
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,276
TERRIFIED OF... OF ONE THING.

610
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,309
YOU KNOW, WHITES ARE, OF COURSE,

611
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:35,866
TERRIFIED OF BEING CALLED A

612
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:37,400
RACIST.

613
00:15:37,466 --> 00:15:38,333
BLACKS ARE TERRIFIED OF BEING

614
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:38,833
BELITTLED.

615
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,333
OF COURSE.

616
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,700
I... I... I THINK WE NEED...

617
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:42,166
ACTUALLY PROBABLY LESS

618
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,233
CONVERSATION ABOUT RACE.

619
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:44,400
I THINK IT MIGHT DO US GOOD

620
00:15:44,466 --> 00:15:45,866
WERE WE TO IGNORE THE SUBJECT

621
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:47,466
A LITTLE BIT AND TREAT EACH

622
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:48,709
OTHER AS IF THERE WERE NO COLOR

623
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:49,900
BOUNDARY SEPARATING US.

624
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:51,042
I THINK THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL.

625
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:52,500
I THINK WE TALK ABOUT IT IN SOME

626
00:15:52,566 --> 00:15:54,733
WAYS TOO MUCH.

627
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,366
OKAY, FIRST, I'M PRETTY

628
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:58,233
SURE BLACK PEOPLE ARE LESS

629
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,900
TERRIFIED OF BEING "BELITTLED"

630
00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:00,633
THAN OF BEING KILLED, JAILED,

631
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,933
ECONOMICALLY EXPLOITED, OR

632
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,333
INDEED, DENIED ACCESS TO

633
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,066
HEALTHCARE AFTER THEIR HEADS

634
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:07,066
LITERALLY EXPLODE FROM HEARING

635
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,866
SOMEONE IN A BOW TIE AND PLAID

636
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:10,133
BLAZER SUGGEST BEING CALLED

637
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,766
RACIST IS AS BAD AS ACTUALLY

638
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,633
EXPERIENCING RACISM.

639
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,900
ALTHOUGH, I DO WANT TO QUICKLY

640
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:15,733
COME BACK TO THAT SPECIFIC

641
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,066
BOW TIE.

642
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:17,900
BECAUSE, LOOK, I'M NOT KNOCKING

643
00:16:17,966 --> 00:16:19,066
BOW TIES IN GENERAL.

644
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:20,433
THEY'RE PERFECTLY FINE FOR

645
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,100
A CHILD ATTENDING HIS FIRST

646
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,633
COMMUNION, OR A HANNA-BARBERA

647
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,980
ANIMATOR WHO CAN'T DRAW NECKS...

648
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:27,166
BUT THAT BOW TIE IS TOO SMALL.

649
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:27,966
EITHER COMMIT TO IT OR

650
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:30,166
DON'T, TUCKER.

651
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:31,376
DON'T JUST PUT ON A TINY ONE AND

652
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,200
HOPE NO ONE NOTICES.

653
00:16:33,266 --> 00:16:34,833
NOW, FROM THERE, TUCKER BOUNCED

654
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,200
AROUND A BIT, WITH CANCELED

655
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:38,033
SHOWS ON BOTH CNN AND MSNBC.

656
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,433
ALTHOUGH IN HIS TIME AT CNN, HE

657
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,333
DID MANAGE TO PRODUCE... AND I

658
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,700
DON'T SAY THIS LIGHTLY... THE

659
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:44,633
MOST 2003 CLIP OF ALL TIME.

660
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,500
YOU WORKED WITH PEPSI

661
00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:47,100
FOR A LONG TIME.

662
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,633
CANDIDLY, JUST BETWEEN YOU AND

663
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,940
ME, HOW MUCH PEPSI DO YOU THINK

664
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,766
YOU DRINK ON AN AVERAGE DAY?

665
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:51,633
I REALLY DO LIKE PEPSI.

666
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,400
REALLY?

667
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:53,166
I REALLY DO.

668
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:54,100
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE KIND?

669
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:54,700
MY FAVORITE KIND OF PEPSI?

670
00:16:54,766 --> 00:16:55,466
PEPSI'S PEPSI.

671
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:56,266
WELL, YOU DON'T DRINK

672
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,233
DIET PEPSI OR...

673
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,376
NO, JUST... JUST REG... JUST

674
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,533
REG... REGULAR PEPSI.

675
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,066
LOOK, I CANNOT STRESS

676
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,833
LEAVE BRITNEY ALONE!

677
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,033
DON'T DO GOTCHA JOURNALISM ABOUT

678
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,500
HER PEPSI CONSUMPTION... NOT

679
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:10,642
ONLY HAS SHE BEEN THROUGH A LOT,

680
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,433
SHE'S A STONE COLD LEGEND.

681
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,676
SHE'S THE DEFINITIONAL DIVA OF

682
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,133
THE 2000s, AND I GUARANTEE YOU:

683
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,466
THERE ISN'T A HUMAN BEING ON

684
00:17:16,533 --> 00:17:17,466
EARTH WHO DOESN'T PERK UP WHEN

685
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:18,133
THAT VIOLIN HOOK FROM "TOXIC"

686
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
COMES ON.

687
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:21,833
EXACTLY!

688
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,900
PUT SOME MOTHERFUCKING RESPECT

689
00:17:23,966 --> 00:17:25,266
ON HER NAME, TUCKER, AND... OF

690
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,733
COURSE... #FreeBritney.

691
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,266
AND WHILE TUCKER EVENTUALLY

692
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,400
FAILED UPWARDS INTO

693
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,133
A PRIMETIME FOX SHOW IN 2016,

694
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,866
THE FASCINATING THING IS,

695
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:34,166
IF YOU GO BACK AND WATCH HIS

696
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:35,566
EARLIER CLIPS, YOU CAN SEE HIM

697
00:17:35,633 --> 00:17:36,400
LEARNING THE TRICKS OF HIS

698
00:17:36,466 --> 00:17:38,133
TRADE, RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

699
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,600
WATCH HIM TALK ABOUT

700
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:40,809
PAT BUCHANAN... THE REPUBLICAN

701
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,066
FIRE-BRAND AND NOTED

702
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:43,242
ANTI-IMMIGRANT CRUSADER... AND

703
00:17:43,266 --> 00:17:44,833
BREAK DOWN ONE OF BUCHANAN'S

704
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,076
GO-TO MOVES, WITH THE PRECISION

705
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,133
OF A DEDICATED STUDENT.

706
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,409
I MEAN, PAT DOES RAISE ISSUES

707
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:52,666
THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT.

708
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:54,500
UNFORTUNATELY, PAT BUCHANAN

709
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:56,166
RAISES THEM IN A WAY THAT I

710
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:58,066
THINK IS DISCREDITED AND WHEN

711
00:17:58,133 --> 00:18:00,800
ATTACKED, HE CAN ALWAYS FALL

712
00:18:00,866 --> 00:18:02,366
BACK ON THE LINE, "WELL, THE...

713
00:18:02,433 --> 00:18:04,033
YOU KNOW, THE TINY CABAL THAT

714
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,866
CONTROLS AMERICAN POLITICS

715
00:18:05,933 --> 00:18:06,500
DOESN'T LIKE ME BECAUSE I SPEAK

716
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:08,066
TRUTH TO POWER."

717
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:09,633
THIS IS ACTUALLY INCIDENTALLY

718
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,366
ALMOST VERBATIM WHAT HE SAID THE

719
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:12,266
OTHER DAY, "THAT I OFFEND THE

720
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,633
PLUTOCRACY, THAT I'M A WANTED

721
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,466
MAN BY THE INSIDE THE BELTWAY

722
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:19,633
PEOPLE," AND IN EVERY SENSE,

723
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,300
CAST HIMSELF AS A... AS A VICTIM

724
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,300
WHO WAS SORT OF A KAREN SILKWOOD

725
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:25,300
OF POLITICS, SOMEONE WHO'S SO

726
00:18:25,366 --> 00:18:27,866
TRUTHFUL THAT HE'S BEING HUNTED

727
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:29,733
DOWN BY THE... BY THE CONSPIRACY

728
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,033
THAT RUNS WASHINGTON.

729
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,833
I MEAN, IT'S ALL A BIT MUCH.

730
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,700
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT,

731
00:18:33,766 --> 00:18:36,966
TUCKER... IT IS!

732
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:37,900
AND THAT IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY

733
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:38,566
SALIENT POINT, IT'S JUST

734
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:40,366
INCREDIBLY HARD TO TAKE,

735
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:40,833
GIVEN WHO'S MAKING IT.

736
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,400
IN THE SAME WAY IT WOULD BE HARD

737
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:46,000
TO LISTEN TO A LECTURE ON GUN

738
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:47,866
SAFETY AND OVERALL LIFE CHOICES

739
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:48,633
FROM TEKASHI69.

740
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,733
I DON'T CARE HOW GOOD YOUR

741
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,733
ADVICE IS.

742
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,900
I'M NOT TAKING IT FROM YOU.

743
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,009
BECAUSE "THE TINY CABAL THAT

744
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:54,800
CONTROLS AMERICAN POLITICS

745
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:56,133
DOESN'T LIKE ME BECAUSE I SPEAK

746
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,309
TRUTH TO POWER" IS NOW TUCKER'S

747
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,600
SIGNATURE MOVE.

748
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,966
HE DOES IT ALL THE TIME,

749
00:19:00,033 --> 00:19:01,800
WHENEVER HE'S CRITICIZED.

750
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:03,200
A FEW YEARS AGO, HE LOST

751
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:04,633
ADVERTISERS AFTER SAYING, AND I

752
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,066
QUOTE, THAT IMMIGRANTS MAKE OUR

753
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:07,176
COUNTRY "POORER AND DIRTIER AND

754
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,300
MORE DIVIDED."

755
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:11,666
AND THIS IS HOW HE FIRED BACK.

756
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,300
THOSE WHO WON'T SHUT UP GET

757
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:13,300
SILENCED.

758
00:19:13,366 --> 00:19:14,866
YOU'VE SEEN IT A MILLION TIMES.

759
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:17,600
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

760
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:18,906
THE ENFORCERS SCREAM, "RACIST,"

761
00:19:18,966 --> 00:19:19,733
ON TWITTER UNTIL EVERYBODY GETS

762
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,900
INTIMIDATED.

763
00:19:20,966 --> 00:19:22,176
IT'S A TACTIC, A WELL-WORN ONE.

764
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,933
NOBODY THINKS IT'S REAL.

765
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,700
AND IT WON'T WORK WITH THIS

766
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:25,500
SHOW.

767
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:27,466
WE'RE NOT INTIMIDATED.

768
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:28,400
WE PLAN TO TRY TO SAY WHAT'S

769
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:30,100
TRUE UNTIL THE LAST DAY.

770
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,666
AND THE TRUTH IS UNREGULATED

771
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:34,233
MASS IMMIGRATION HAS BADLY HURT

772
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,033
THIS COUNTRY'S NATURAL

773
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,733
LANDSCAPE.

774
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,266
OH, FUCK OFF, TUCKER,

775
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,500
YOU RELENTLESSLY INDIGNANT

776
00:19:39,566 --> 00:19:41,133
PICKET FENCE.

777
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,366
HOW DID YOU GO FROM CRITICIZING

778
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:46,933
PAT BUCHANAN FOR THAT PRECISE

779
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,833
TACTIC TO BASICALLY IMITATING

780
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,466
HIM?

781
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:49,576
IT'S ALL... TO BORROW A PHRASE

782
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,533
..."A BIT MUCH."

783
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,133
BUT THAT TECHNIQUE GETS TO THE

784
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,900
ABSOLUTE HEART OF TUCKER'S SHOW:

785
00:19:52,966 --> 00:19:54,366
SO OFTEN, HE POSITIONS HIMSELF

786
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:55,866
AS SOMEONE JUST ASKING THE HARD

787
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:57,600
QUESTIONS... THE ONES THAT

788
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,566
"THEY" DON'T WANT YOU ASKING.

789
00:19:58,633 --> 00:19:59,709
QUESTIONS LIKE, "IS AFFIRMATIVE

790
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:00,933
ACTION RACIST?"

791
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,009
AND "SHOULD AMERICA BE SELECTIVE

792
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:03,100
WITH IMMIGRANTS?"

793
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,766
AND "HAS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

794
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:05,766
BECOME ANTI-WHITE AND

795
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,366
ANTI-MALE?"

796
00:20:07,433 --> 00:20:08,766
JUST ASKING QUESTIONS, WHILE

797
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:14,000
HEAVILY IMPLYING THAT THE ANSWER

798
00:20:14,066 --> 00:20:14,833
TO THOSE QUESTIONS IS YES.

799
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,900
BUT WHEN, IN TURN, ANYONE

800
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:16,766
QUESTIONS HIM, THEY'RE NOT JUST

801
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:17,766
CENSORING FREE SPEECH, THEY'RE

802
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,400
LAUNCHING AN ATTACK ON THE

803
00:20:19,466 --> 00:20:20,733
FOUNDATIONS OF OUR DEMOCRACY,

804
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:27,066
AND THE VAST WORKING CLASS WHO

805
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:28,766
THIS HUMBLE TV DINNER

806
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:29,966
PRINCE SOMEHOW REPRESENTS.

807
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:30,866
AND THE MOST TELLING THING ABOUT

808
00:20:30,933 --> 00:20:32,042
TUCKER'S FRAMING OF HIMSELF AS

809
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:32,766
THE SCOURGE OF THE ELITES AND

810
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,100
THE HERO OF THE COMMON MAN IS

811
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:34,633
THAT, FOR TUCKER, WHO

812
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,809
CONSTITUTES "THE COMMON MAN" IS

813
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:36,533
VERY SELECTIVE.

814
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,866
TAKE ILHAN OMAR.

815
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:39,600
JUST WATCH HIM LOSE HIS SHIT

816
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,133
OVER A CLIP HE'S ABOUT TO PLAY

817
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,533
OF SOMETHING SHE SAID.

818
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,933
IF ANYONE SHOULD LOVE

819
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,500
AMERICA, IT'S ILHAN OMAR.

820
00:20:45,566 --> 00:20:46,709
THIS COUNTRY RESCUED HER FROM A

821
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:48,866
SQUALID KENYAN REFUGEE CAMP AND

822
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:49,976
MADE HER A NATIONAL FIGURE,

823
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,433
QUITE AN ASCENT.

824
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,300
BUT ILHAN OMAR IS NOT GRATEFUL.

825
00:20:53,366 --> 00:20:54,433
SHE HATES US FOR IT.

826
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,733
WATCH OMAR TELL US IT IS TIME TO

827
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,533
DISMANTLE OUR COUNTRY.

828
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,300
AS LONG AS OUR ECONOMY AND

829
00:21:02,366 --> 00:21:04,600
POLITICAL SYSTEMS PRIORITIZE

830
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,333
PROFIT WITHOUT CONSIDERING WHO

831
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,933
IS PROFITING, WHO IS BEING SHUT

832
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,333
OUT, WE WILL PERPETUATE THIS

833
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,833
INEQUALITY.

834
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,942
SO WE CANNOT STOP AT CRIMINAL

835
00:21:16,966 --> 00:21:18,700
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

836
00:21:18,766 --> 00:21:21,100
WE MUST BEGIN THE WORK OF

837
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,133
DISMANTLING THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF

838
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,433
OPPRESSION WHEREVER WE FIND IT.

839
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,733
DISMANTLE THE AMERICAN

840
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,866
ECONOMY AND THE AMERICAN SYSTEM

841
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:33,466
OF GOVERNMENT, INSTITUTIONS THAT

842
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:34,333
GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS BUILT

843
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,700
OVER HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

844
00:21:36,766 --> 00:21:38,333
ALL RIGHT, THERE IS

845
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,366
ALREADY ENOUGH THERE IN THE

846
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:41,513
SNEERING CONDESCENSION THAT

847
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,200
ILHAN OMAR SHOULD BE QUIETLY

848
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:44,766
GRATEFUL HER ENTIRE LIFE BECAUSE

849
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,033
SHE WAS GRANTED ASYLUM WHEN SHE

850
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,633
WAS A CHILD.

851
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,909
BUT LET'S JUST CONSIDER THE VAST

852
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,866
DISTANCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU JUST

853
00:21:51,933 --> 00:21:52,566
HEARD HER SAY AND WHAT HE SEEMED

854
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:53,466
TO HEAR.

855
00:21:53,533 --> 00:21:54,400
BECAUSE ACCORDING TO TUCKER,

856
00:21:54,466 --> 00:21:55,600
DISMANTLING THE SYSTEM OF

857
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,300
OPPRESSION MEANS DISMANTLING

858
00:21:57,366 --> 00:21:58,633
THE ENTIRE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND

859
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,133
SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT.

860
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,376
NOW, DID HE INADVERTENTLY MAKE A

861
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,333
NUANCED POINT ABOUT HOW SYSTEMIC

862
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,233
OPPRESSION IS DEFINITIONALLY

863
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,733
BAKED INTO EVERY LEVEL AND FACET

864
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,633
OF THAT VERY SAME SYSTEM?

865
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,200
YES, YES HE DID.

866
00:22:09,266 --> 00:22:09,900
AM I GOING TO GIVE HIM CREDIT

867
00:22:09,966 --> 00:22:10,733
FOR DOING THAT?

868
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,400
FUCK NO!

869
00:22:12,466 --> 00:22:13,266
ESPECIALLY NOT WHEN THIS IS WHAT

870
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,833
HE SAID NEXT:

871
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,700
THE PROBLEM IS, THERE ARE

872
00:22:16,766 --> 00:22:17,776
MANY OF US HERE WHO DO LIKE THIS

873
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,266
COUNTRY.

874
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,633
WE LIVE HERE.

875
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,266
WE DON'T WANT TO DESTROY IT.

876
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:23,900
WE HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO FIGHT TO

877
00:22:23,966 --> 00:22:25,333
PRESERVE OUR NATION AND OUR

878
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,533
HERITAGE AND OUR CULTURE.

879
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,766
WOW, "PRESERVE OUR

880
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,733
HERITAGE AND CULTURE."

881
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,500
THAT IS DIRECT.

882
00:22:32,566 --> 00:22:34,133
IN FACT, HIS PRE-WRITTEN CAPTION

883
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,633
THERE... "WE HAVE TO FIGHT TO

884
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,966
PRESERVE OUR NATION AND

885
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:37,833
HERITAGE" DREW A LOT OF

886
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,133
COMPARISONS TO THE

887
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,966
"FOURTEEN WORDS," THE FAMOUS

888
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:43,166
WHITE SUPREMACIST SLOGAN THAT

889
00:22:43,233 --> 00:22:44,300
SAYS, "WE MUST SECURE THE

890
00:22:44,366 --> 00:22:45,446
EXISTENCE OF OUR PEOPLE AND

891
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,333
A FUTURE FOR WHITE CHILDREN."

892
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,666
AND WHEN YOU PUT THE TWO

893
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,133
TOGETHER, THERE IS, Y'KNOW,

894
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,933
A SLIGHT SIMILARITY THERE.

895
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,900
I'M JUST SAYING... IF YOU TYPED

896
00:22:52,966 --> 00:22:54,300
TUCKER'S QUOTE INTO A BLANK WORD

897
00:22:54,366 --> 00:22:56,300
DOCUMENT, NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN,

898
00:22:56,366 --> 00:22:56,933
CLIPPY IS GOING TO ASK "ARE YOU

899
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,700
TRYING TO RECITE THE FOURTEEN

900
00:22:57,766 --> 00:22:59,200
WORDS?"

901
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:01,000
OF COURSE, CLIPPY'S BEEN ASKING

902
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:02,233
THAT A LOT MORE EVER SINCE HE

903
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,000
STARTED SPENDING SO MUCH TIME ON

904
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:03,866
YOUTUBE.

905
00:23:03,933 --> 00:23:05,566
CAREFUL HOW MUCH TIME YOU SPEND

906
00:23:05,633 --> 00:23:06,566
ON THERE, CLIPPY, IT'S TURNING

907
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:07,900
YOU INTO AN ASSHOLE.

908
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:10,500
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "WELL,

909
00:23:10,566 --> 00:23:11,366
COME ONE, THAT SEEMS LIKE A

910
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:12,000
STRETCH.

911
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:14,333
YOU CAN'T KNOW WHAT TUCKER MEANS

912
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,300
BY "OUR HERITAGE AND CULTURE,"

913
00:23:16,366 --> 00:23:17,666
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT HE HASN'T

914
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:18,466
ALWAYS BEEN THAT DISCIPLINED

915
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:20,500
ABOUT MESSAGING.

916
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:21,466
IN THE LATE 2000s, HE USED TO

917
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,933
CALL INTO A RADIO SHOW HOSTED

918
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,800
BY SHOCK JOCK BUBBA THE LOVE

919
00:23:23,866 --> 00:23:24,800
SPONGE.

920
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:26,500
AND IN THOSE CALLS, THE THIN

921
00:23:26,566 --> 00:23:28,133
VEIL COVERING HIS RACISM WOULD

922
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,300
OCCASIONALLY THROWN OFF, IN

923
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,766
MOMENTS LIKE THIS.

924
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,766
IRAQ IS A CRAPPY PLACE FILLED

925
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:33,333
WITH A BUNCH OF, YOU KNOW...

926
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,033
YEAH.

927
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,266
SEMI-LITERATE PRIMITIVE

928
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:36,233
MONKEYS.

929
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,133
BUT I JUST HAVE ZERO SYMPATHY

930
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,333
FOR THEM OR THEIR CULTURE.

931
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,666
A CULTURE WHERE PEOPLE JUST

932
00:23:40,733 --> 00:23:41,200
DON'T USE TOILET PAPER OR

933
00:23:41,266 --> 00:23:41,900
FORKS.

934
00:23:41,966 --> 00:23:43,066
OKAY.

935
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:44,066
THAT ISN'T JUST INCREDIBLY

936
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:45,533
OFFENSIVE.

937
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,000
IT'S ALSO THE KIND OF FACT-FREE

938
00:23:47,066 --> 00:23:48,766
CULTURAL HOT TAKE THAT IS

939
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:50,833
THE ESSENTIAL TUCKER CARLSON

940
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,766
EXPERIENCE, BECAUSE WHILE IT IS

941
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:54,333
CLEARLY BY NO MEANS THE MOST

942
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,066
IMPORTANT THING THERE, FOR THE

943
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:57,400
TABLE FORKS WERE

944
00:23:57,466 --> 00:23:58,586
APPARENTLY FIRST USED IN THE

945
00:23:58,633 --> 00:23:59,900
MIDDLE EAST AND BYZANTINE

946
00:23:59,966 --> 00:24:01,166
EMPIRE, AND WERE STILL

947
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:02,242
"CONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT" IN EUROPE

948
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:03,766
UNTIL CENTURIES LATER.

949
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:04,876
IN FACT, WHEN THE NIECE OF A

950
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,433
BYZANTINE EMPEROR BROUGHT A CASE

951
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,566
OF FORKS TO VENICE FOR HER

952
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:09,000
WEDDING FEAST IN THE ELEVENTH

953
00:24:09,066 --> 00:24:10,000
CENTURY, SHE WAS "ROUNDLY

954
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:11,226
CONDEMNED BY THE LOCAL CLERGY

955
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:12,800
FOR HER DECADENCE," WITH ONE

956
00:24:12,866 --> 00:24:14,100
SAYING, "GOD IN HIS WISDOM HAS

957
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,566
PROVIDED MAN WITH NATURAL FORKS:

958
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:16,566
HIS FINGERS.

959
00:24:16,633 --> 00:24:17,800
THEREFORE, IT IS AN INSULT TO

960
00:24:17,866 --> 00:24:19,266
HIM TO SUBSTITUTE ARTIFICIAL

961
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,566
METAL FORKS FOR THEM WHEN

962
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:21,800
EATING."

963
00:24:21,866 --> 00:24:22,942
WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING.

964
00:24:22,966 --> 00:24:24,700
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST A FULL

965
00:24:24,766 --> 00:24:26,333
REFUTATION OF TUCKER'S LAZY

966
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,476
RACISM, IT'S ALSO A VERY FUN

967
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,733
FORK FACT.

968
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,400
FORK FACT!

969
00:24:30,466 --> 00:24:33,433
FORK FACTS ARE FUN!

970
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,433
THE POINT IS, WHEN YOU KNOW HOW

971
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,333
TUCKER SPEAKS WHEN HE SPEAKS

972
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,609
FREELY, THE FILTER THROUGH WHICH

973
00:24:38,633 --> 00:24:39,676
HE PROCESSES THE WORLD FOR HIS

974
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,833
AUDIENCE BECOMES PAINFULLY

975
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,500
APPARENT.

976
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:44,133
BECAUSE HE'S SMART ENOUGH NOT TO

977
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,133
OPENLY SAY INTO A CAMERA THAT

978
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,733
CERTAIN RACES ARE MORE DESERVING

979
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,733
OF SCORN, OR LESS WORTHY OF

980
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,633
RESPECT.

981
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,266
HE WILL JUST HEAVILY IMPLY THAT,

982
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:52,266
DEPENDING ON WHO HE'S TALKING

983
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:53,233
ABOUT.

984
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,366
TAKE THE CAPITOL RIOTS.

985
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:56,633
TUCKER SAID THAT HE DEPLORED

986
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,066
THE VIOLENCE, BUT REPEATEDLY

987
00:24:59,133 --> 00:25:01,033
COMPELLED HIS VIEWERS TO TRY AND

988
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:07,900
UNDERSTAND WHERE THE PEOPLE

989
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:08,900
DEMONSTRATORS WERE COMING FROM.

990
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:09,866
ON JANUARY 6TH, WE HAD A RIOT

991
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:10,800
AT THE U.S. CAPITOL.

992
00:25:10,866 --> 00:25:11,900
WHY DID THAT HAPPEN?

993
00:25:11,966 --> 00:25:12,900
IT HAPPENED BECAUSE MILLIONS OF

994
00:25:12,966 --> 00:25:13,976
AMERICAN VOTERS WERE CONVINCED

995
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,009
THAT THE LAST ELECTION WAS NOT

996
00:25:15,033 --> 00:25:16,033
FAIR.

997
00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:17,076
WHERE DID THEY GET THAT IDEA?

998
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,866
WELL, IT WASN'T SIMPLY BECAUSE

999
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,400
THE LAST PRESIDENT TOLD THEM SO,

1000
00:25:19,466 --> 00:25:20,766
YOU'RE HEARING THAT NOW AS IF

1001
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:21,833
THEY ARE ANIMALS WHO TAKE

1002
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:22,466
COMMANDS AND DO WHAT THEY'RE

1003
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:23,733
TOLD, BUT THEY'RE NOT ANIMALS.

1004
00:25:23,766 --> 00:25:24,466
THEY ARE PEOPLE.

1005
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:25,966
THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS WHO

1006
00:25:26,033 --> 00:25:26,700
CAN SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING AND

1007
00:25:26,766 --> 00:25:27,776
COME TO THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS

1008
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,233
ABOUT IT.

1009
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,000
THEY SAW THE RADICAL INCREASE IN

1010
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:35,166
MAIL-IN VOTING, MILLIONS DID,

1011
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,666
AND IT CORRODED THEIR FAITH AND

1012
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:37,633
THE PUBLIC'S FAITH IN OUR

1013
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,633
SYSTEMS OF ELECTION.

1014
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,566
OKAY, HOLD ON.

1015
00:25:40,633 --> 00:25:41,842
PEOPLE DIDN'T THINK THE ELECTION

1016
00:25:41,866 --> 00:25:42,566
WAS RIGGED BECAUSE THEY SAW AN

1017
00:25:42,633 --> 00:25:45,466
"INCREASE IN MAIL-IN VOTING."

1018
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:46,609
THEY THOUGHT THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE

1019
00:25:46,633 --> 00:25:48,133
LIKE YOU REPEATEDLY TOLD THEM

1020
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,333
THE ELECTION WAS RIGGED.

1021
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,066
AND THAT PLEA FOR UNDERSTANDING

1022
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,266
THERE IS ESPECIALLY HARD TO TAKE

1023
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:54,600
WHEN YOU CONTRAST IT WITH HOW

1024
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:55,766
HE REACTED TO LAST SUMMER'S

1025
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:58,133
BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTS.

1026
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,766
PEOPLE LIKE THIS DON'T BOTHER

1027
00:25:58,833 --> 00:25:59,666
TO WORK.

1028
00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:01,100
THEY DON'T VOLUNTEER OR

1029
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:04,200
PAY TAXES TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE.

1030
00:26:04,266 --> 00:26:06,033
THEY LIVE FOR THEMSELVES.

1031
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,466
THEY DO EXACTLY WHAT THEY

1032
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,100
FEEL LIKE DOING.

1033
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:10,366
THEY SAY EXACTLY WHAT THEY

1034
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:11,600
FEEL LIKE SAYING.

1035
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:12,533
THEY SPRAY PAINT THEIR OPINIONS

1036
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,866
ON BUILDINGS.

1037
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:16,900
ON TELEVISION, HOUR BY HOUR,

1038
00:26:16,966 --> 00:26:17,733
WE WATCH THESE PEOPLE,

1039
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,100
CRIMINAL MOBS, DESTROY WHAT

1040
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:21,466
THE REST OF US HAVE BUILT.

1041
00:26:21,533 --> 00:26:23,366
THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO DO THAT.

1042
00:26:23,433 --> 00:26:24,553
THEY DON'T CONTRIBUTE TO THE

1043
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,333
COMMON GOOD.

1044
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,133
THEY NEVER HAVE.

1045
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,000
YET, SUDDENLY THEY SEEM TO HAVE

1046
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:29,966
ALL THE POWER.

1047
00:26:30,033 --> 00:26:31,076
WELL, THAT'S QUITE

1048
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,100
A DIFFERENT TONE.

1049
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:34,000
AND IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE WHO

1050
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:35,142
GETS TO BE "AMERICAN CITIZENS

1051
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:36,733
WHO CAME TO THEIR OWN

1052
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,666
CONCLUSIONS," AND WHO GETS TO BE

1053
00:26:37,733 --> 00:26:39,933
"CRIMINAL MOBS WHO DESTROY WHAT

1054
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,800
THE REST OF US HAVE BUILT."

1055
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,033
AND IT DOES SEEM LIKE THE

1056
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,176
DIVIDING LINE FOR TUCKER ON THAT

1057
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,800
QUESTION IS, "HOW EASILY CAN YOU

1058
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:47,000
SUNBURN?"

1059
00:26:47,066 --> 00:26:49,833
AND LOOK, MY POINT HERE ISN'T

1060
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,200
THAT TUCKER IS INCONSISTENT, IN

1061
00:26:51,266 --> 00:26:52,309
ADDRESSING TWO VIOLENT PROTESTS

1062
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:52,933
IN VASTLY DIFFERENT WAYS.

1063
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,966
IT'S THAT HE'S ACTUALLY

1064
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:57,066
INCREDIBLY CONSISTENT, BECAUSE

1065
00:26:57,133 --> 00:26:58,433
IN BOTH INSTANCES, HIS CLEAR

1066
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,266
TAKEAWAY IS THAT WHITE PEOPLE

1067
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:01,442
SHOULD BE TERRIFIED AT THE IDEA

1068
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:02,566
OF ANY SITUATION WHERE THEY

1069
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:04,800
AREN'T IN POWER.

1070
00:27:04,866 --> 00:27:06,433
THE MAIN NARRATIVE OF TUCKER'S

1071
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,833
SHOW IS THAT POWER IS BEING

1072
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,266
TAKEN AWAY FROM "YOU," HIS

1073
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:10,066
VIEWER... AND THAT THIS NEEDS TO

1074
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:11,966
BE RESISTED.

1075
00:27:12,033 --> 00:27:13,109
HE'S RUN SEGMENTS... JUST ASKING

1076
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:14,300
QUESTIONS, REMEMBER... LIKE,

1077
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:15,900
"HOW EXACTLY IS DIVERSITY OUR

1078
00:27:15,966 --> 00:27:17,000
STRENGTH?"

1079
00:27:17,066 --> 00:27:19,066
AND HAS ARGUED NOT JUST THAT IT

1080
00:27:19,133 --> 00:27:20,900
ISN'T, BUT THAT IT'S A "THREAT

1081
00:27:20,966 --> 00:27:22,533
TO OUR EXISTENCE AS A COHESIVE

1082
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,900
COUNTRY."

1083
00:27:24,966 --> 00:27:25,833
IN FACT, HE'LL OFTEN CALL TO

1084
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,800
RESIST THAT THREAT WITH AN

1085
00:27:26,866 --> 00:27:28,066
INTERESTING CHOICE OF PHRASE.

1086
00:27:28,133 --> 00:27:29,400
WESTERN CIVILIZATION

1087
00:27:29,466 --> 00:27:30,500
IS OUR BIRTHRIGHT.

1088
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,166
IT MAKES ALL GOOD THINGS

1089
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,066
POSSIBLE.

1090
00:27:33,133 --> 00:27:34,900
UNDEFENDED, IT COLLAPSES.

1091
00:27:34,966 --> 00:27:36,033
AND SO WE'VE GOT TO FIGHT

1092
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,333
TO PRESERVE IT.

1093
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,966
IT'S A WAR, WITH ONE SIDE

1094
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:40,333
TRYING TO ERASE ALL REMNANTS OF

1095
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,033
ITS OPPONENT.

1096
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:41,800
IN THIS CASE,

1097
00:27:41,866 --> 00:27:43,400
WESTERN CIVILIZATION.

1098
00:27:43,466 --> 00:27:45,933
IS THE CULTURE INTO WHICH

1099
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,133
THEY'RE COMING, THE WESTERN

1100
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,100
CIVILIZATION WE'RE TALKING

1101
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,900
ABOUT, SUPERIOR TO THE CULTURE

1102
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:52,233
THAT THESE IMMIGRANTS ARE

1103
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,200
BRINGING?

1104
00:27:53,266 --> 00:27:54,900
DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO

1105
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:57,100
MOVE A LARGE MUSLIM POPULATION

1106
00:27:57,166 --> 00:27:58,400
INTO THE WEST AND SUCCESSFULLY

1107
00:27:58,466 --> 00:27:59,400
INTEGRATE THEM INTO WESTERN

1108
00:27:59,466 --> 00:27:59,800
CULTURE?

1109
00:27:59,866 --> 00:28:02,500
HAVE YOU SEEN THAT ANYWHERE?

1110
00:28:02,566 --> 00:28:05,366
YEAH, FOR TUCKER,

1111
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,300
IT SEEMS WESTERN CIVILIZATION IS

1112
00:28:06,366 --> 00:28:08,100
SOMEHOW BOTH THE MIGHTY AND

1113
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:09,000
ESSENTIAL BEDROCK ON WHICH ALL

1114
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:10,209
MODERN HUMAN EXISTENCE IS BUILT,

1115
00:28:10,233 --> 00:28:11,733
AND ALSO, A DELICATE HOUSE OF

1116
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,600
CARDS THAT WILL COLLAPSE IF YOU

1117
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:13,966
SO MUCH AS LOOK AT IT WRONG.

1118
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:15,142
AND AGAIN, HE'LL BE CAREFUL NOT

1119
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:17,733
TO VERBALLY LINK RACE AND

1120
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,040
CIVILIZATION, LIKE HE'S CALLING

1121
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,380
IN TO A LOVE SPONGE'S RADIO SHOW

1122
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:21,933
IN 2006.

1123
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,966
BUT HE WILL OCCASIONALLY DANCE

1124
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:25,066
INCREDIBLY CLOSE TO IT.

1125
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:26,200
LET ME JUST STIPULATE.

1126
00:28:26,266 --> 00:28:27,566
I AM FOR GETTING ALONG.

1127
00:28:27,633 --> 00:28:29,166
I AM FOR COLORBLINDNESS,

1128
00:28:29,233 --> 00:28:30,833
I'M FOR TOLERANCE, 100%.

1129
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,633
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT IF THINGS

1130
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,466
RADICALLY CHANGE IN YOUR

1131
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:35,000
COUNTRY, IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO

1132
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:36,333
SAY, WHAT IS THIS, AND MAYBE I

1133
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,033
DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY

1134
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,600
THAT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE

1135
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:38,500
COUNTRY I GREW UP IN.

1136
00:28:38,566 --> 00:28:42,300
IS THAT BIGOTED?

1137
00:28:42,366 --> 00:28:43,266
UH, YEAH.

1138
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:44,000
YEAH, IT IS.

1139
00:28:44,066 --> 00:28:45,142
THAT'S LIKE SAYING, "I'VE GOT

1140
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:46,066
TEN FINGERS AND TOES, A POINTY

1141
00:28:46,133 --> 00:28:47,176
FACE WITH A LITTLE PINK ROSEBUD

1142
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,966
MOUTH, A CAT-SIZED BODY, A LONG

1143
00:28:48,033 --> 00:28:49,142
WEIRD TAIL, AND I EAT GARBAGE.

1144
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:49,900
DOES THAT MAKE ME A POSSUM?"

1145
00:28:49,966 --> 00:28:52,200
YES!

1146
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:53,066
YES, IT DOES!

1147
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:55,100
THAT'S THE LITERAL DEFINITION OF

1148
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:58,566
THE THING YOU JUST DESCRIBED!

1149
00:28:58,633 --> 00:28:59,642
AND THAT IS THE WHOLE THING WITH

1150
00:28:59,666 --> 00:28:59,933
TUCKER.

1151
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,700
HE MIGHT NOT SAY "BLACK" OR

1152
00:29:00,766 --> 00:29:01,966
"WHITE," HE'LL INSIST HE'S

1153
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:03,200
"FOR COLORBLINDNESS," HE'LL

1154
00:29:03,266 --> 00:29:05,133
BUILD IN DENIABILITY BY PHRASING

1155
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,600
THINGS AS A QUESTION... LIKE,

1156
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:07,433
WHAT DOES RACISM LOOK LIKE?

1157
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,933
WHILE KIND OF EMBODYING THE

1158
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,933
ANSWER.

1159
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,833
BUT WHEN YOU PUT ALL OF THIS

1160
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,466
TOGETHER, THE PATTERN IS CLEAR:

1161
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:15,100
HE'S SCARED OF A COUNTRY THAT

1162
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:16,633
"LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE ONE HE

1163
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,133
GREW UP IN," BECAUSE DIVERSITY

1164
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,276
ISN'T OUR STRENGTH, IMMIGRANTS

1165
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,300
MAKE OUR COUNTRY POORER,

1166
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:21,966
DIRTIER, AND MORE DIVIDED,

1167
00:29:22,033 --> 00:29:23,966
AND ANY ATTEMPT TO CHANGE THAT

1168
00:29:24,033 --> 00:29:24,466
CULTURE IS AN ATTACK ON

1169
00:29:24,533 --> 00:29:27,166
WESTERN CIVILIZATION.

1170
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:28,700
ALL OF WHICH IS A LONG WAY OF

1171
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:30,166
SAYING THAT WHEN TUCKER ASKS,

1172
00:29:30,233 --> 00:29:32,533
"WHAT IS WHITE SUPREMACY?"

1173
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,533
THE ANSWER IS BASICALLY THAT.

1174
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,400
IT'S A BELIEF THAT, IN A COUNTRY

1175
00:29:36,466 --> 00:29:37,709
WHERE WHITE PEOPLE ARE DOMINANT,

1176
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:39,466
THAT'S ALL DOWN TO THEIR NATURAL

1177
00:29:39,533 --> 00:29:41,233
AND INNATE ABILITIES, AND ANY

1178
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,433
EFFORT TO CHANGE THAT IS AN

1179
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,333
AFFRONT TO THE NATURAL ORDER OF

1180
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,366
THINGS.

1181
00:29:46,433 --> 00:29:48,633
SO IT'S FRANKLY NO WONDER THAT

1182
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,333
GUY'S FAMILY WATCHES TUCKER

1183
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,233
TWICE A NIGHT.

1184
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,342
OF COURSE TUCKER'S BEEN ENDORSED

1185
00:29:51,366 --> 00:29:53,666
BY WHITE SUPREMACISTS.

1186
00:29:53,733 --> 00:29:54,500
JAMES ALLSUP... A FAR-RIGHT

1187
00:29:54,566 --> 00:29:55,966
ACTIVIST WHO MARCHED IN

1188
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:57,700
CHARLOTTESVILLE... ONCE SAID

1189
00:29:57,766 --> 00:29:58,842
THIS TO A CONFERENCE ROOM FULL

1190
00:29:58,866 --> 00:30:01,000
OF FELLOW WHITE SUPREMACISTS.

1191
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:01,966
AN EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE

1192
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:03,466
ENGAGING IN VERY EFFECTIVE

1193
00:30:03,533 --> 00:30:04,433
RHETORIC IS, OF COURSE,

1194
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,866
TUCKER CARLSON.

1195
00:30:05,933 --> 00:30:07,233
TUCKER IS HELPING MAINSTREAM

1196
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,200
CONSERVATIVES CHANGE THE WAY

1197
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:09,466
THEY THINK ABOUT POLITICS AND

1198
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:12,000
CAUSING A MASSIVE SWATH OF

1199
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:13,433
TRUMP VOTERS TO LOOK DEEPER

1200
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,400
INTO MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT

1201
00:30:14,466 --> 00:30:16,433
WE ALREADY TALK ABOUT.

1202
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,766
THE LEFT IS AWARE OF WHAT HE'S

1203
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:18,600
DOING AND HE'S AWARE OF WHAT

1204
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:19,166
HE'S DOING, SO IT WORKS

1205
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:20,500
PHENOMENALLY.

1206
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:26,400
OH, THAT MIGHT BE THE

1207
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:27,509
SINGLE WORST LAUGH I'VE EVER

1208
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:28,200
HEARD.

1209
00:30:28,266 --> 00:30:29,033
AND I SAY THAT AS SOMEONE WHO'S

1210
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,866
ALMOST FORGOTTEN WHAT HUMAN

1211
00:30:29,933 --> 00:30:31,866
LAUGHTER SOUNDS LIKE.

1212
00:30:31,933 --> 00:30:35,733
I'VE BEEN STUCK INSIDE CASPER'S

1213
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,600
ASSHOLE FOR 12 LONG MONTHS NOW,

1214
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:37,566
AND I'M SO DESPERATE TO HEAR THE

1215
00:30:37,633 --> 00:30:39,366
RESPONSE OF A LIVE AUDIENCE,

1216
00:30:39,433 --> 00:30:40,700
BUT IF IT'S NEO-NAZI CHUCKLES,

1217
00:30:40,766 --> 00:30:43,600
PINGPONGING OFF THE WALLS OF A

1218
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:47,133
HOTEL BALLROOM,

1219
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,100
I THINK I MIGHT BE OUT.

1220
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:48,800
AND LOOK, IF EVERYTHING I'VE

1221
00:30:48,866 --> 00:30:49,876
SHOWN YOU SOMEHOW STILL ISN'T

1222
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,600
ENOUGH... LET'S HEAR FROM A

1223
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:51,866
LITERAL FORMER GRAND WIZARD OF

1224
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,733
WHITE SUPREMACISTS, DAVID DUKE.

1225
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,833
HE'S NOT ONLY TWEETED

1226
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,733
APPROVINGLY ABOUT TUCKER IN THE

1227
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,166
PAST, SAYING, "TUCKER IS RIGHT!"

1228
00:30:58,233 --> 00:31:01,066
AND "CAN'T CUCK THE TUCK!"

1229
00:31:01,133 --> 00:31:02,066
...WHICH, AS ALL TUCKER VIEWERS

1230
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:02,833
KNOW, REFERS TO WHEN A

1231
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,466
HUMILIATED MAN WATCHES

1232
00:31:03,533 --> 00:31:05,066
HIS WIFE HAVE AN AFFAIR.

1233
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:06,433
DUKE EVEN HAS A PODCAST,

1234
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,366
WHERE HE SOMETIMES JUST RECAPS

1235
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:09,000
TUCKER'S SEGMENTS FROM THE NIGHT

1236
00:31:09,066 --> 00:31:09,700
BEFORE.

1237
00:31:09,766 --> 00:31:11,006
LAST YEAR, WHEN ENDORSING TRUMP

1238
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:13,266
FOR PRESIDENT, HE EVEN SUGGESTED

1239
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:15,366
THAT TUCKER CARLSON SHOULD BE

1240
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:17,433
HIS V.P., EXPLAINING TUCKER'S

1241
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,133
VALUE TO THE WHITE SUPREMACIST

1242
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,000
CAUSE LIKE THIS.

1243
00:31:20,066 --> 00:31:21,900
HE DOESN'T USE THE WORD

1244
00:31:21,966 --> 00:31:23,009
"WHITE" VERY OFTEN, BUT THAT'S

1245
00:31:23,033 --> 00:31:24,313
THE UNDERLYING MESSAGE THAT HE'S

1246
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:25,433
SHOWING.

1247
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,600
AND HE SHOWS THAT THERE IS

1248
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:28,166
MASSIVE RACISM IN AMERICA

1249
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:29,433
AGAINST WHITE PEOPLE, WHILE AT

1250
00:31:29,466 --> 00:31:30,166
THE SAME TIME SAYING THERE'S NO

1251
00:31:30,233 --> 00:31:31,233
SYSTEMATIC RACISM.

1252
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:33,700
BUT PEOPLE GET THE MESSAGE.

1253
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:34,776
YEAH, PEOPLE DO GET THE

1254
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,000
MESSAGE.

1255
00:31:37,066 --> 00:31:37,800
ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR, IT'S NOT

1256
00:31:37,866 --> 00:31:38,566
LIKE IT'S WRITTEN IN A COMPLEX

1257
00:31:38,633 --> 00:31:39,433
CODE.

1258
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,566
IT'S A WALKING YACHT CLUB

1259
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:42,742
SCRUNCHING HIS FACE UP FOR AN

1260
00:31:42,766 --> 00:31:44,066
HOUR EVERY NIGHT AND SAYING TO

1261
00:31:44,133 --> 00:31:45,176
A CONSERVATIVE AUDIENCE "THEY"

1262
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,900
ARE COMING FOR "YOU" IN

1263
00:31:45,966 --> 00:31:47,500
MODULATING TONES.

1264
00:31:47,566 --> 00:31:48,333
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY IN RIDDLE OF

1265
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,566
THE SPHINX TERRITORY HERE.

1266
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:52,000
AND ALL OF THIS IS WHY... AS

1267
00:31:52,066 --> 00:31:53,633
TEMPTING AS IT IS TO DISMISS THE

1268
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,966
CONTROVERSY THAT FOLLOWS TUCKER

1269
00:31:55,033 --> 00:31:57,700
EVERY WEEK AS ONE MORE ARTIFACT

1270
00:31:57,766 --> 00:31:59,233
OF OUR OUTRAGE CULTURE... IT'S

1271
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:04,366
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT WHAT

1272
00:32:04,433 --> 00:32:05,233
TUCKER IS SAYING IS FUCKING

1273
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:05,633
OUTRAGEOUS.

1274
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,366
BECAUSE NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT

1275
00:32:06,433 --> 00:32:07,300
MIND WOULD SIT DOWN, POP IN

1276
00:32:07,366 --> 00:32:08,133
THEIR HEADPHONES, FIRE UP

1277
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,033
DAVID DUKE'S PODCAST AND THINK,

1278
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,633
"HEY, I'M NOT

1279
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,633
A WHITE SUPREMACIST."

1280
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,566
BUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WATCH

1281
00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:15,533
TUCKER ON TV EVERY NIGHT,

1282
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,566
SPOUTING WELL-LAUNDERED VERSIONS

1283
00:32:17,633 --> 00:32:18,776
OF PRETTY MUCH THE SAME TALKING

1284
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,000
POINTS, AND THERE IS REAL HARM

1285
00:32:20,066 --> 00:32:21,100
IN THAT.

1286
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:22,700
BECAUSE WHILE WHITE SUPREMACY IS

1287
00:32:22,766 --> 00:32:24,500
CLEARLY DANGEROUS WHEN PROMOTED

1288
00:32:24,566 --> 00:32:26,166
BY SELF-AVOWED WHITE

1289
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:27,466
SUPREMACISTS, IT CAN ACTUALLY

1290
00:32:27,533 --> 00:32:28,333
BE EVEN MORE DANGEROUS

1291
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,433
WHEN IT ISN'T.

1292
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,576
AND WHAT TUCKER CARLSON'S SHOW

1293
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,000
SELLS... IN ADDITION TO UTTERLY

1294
00:32:34,066 --> 00:32:34,966
TERRIBLE PILLOWS... IS VERY

1295
00:32:35,033 --> 00:32:36,466
SEDUCTIVE.

1296
00:32:36,533 --> 00:32:38,500
IT'S THE IDEA THIS COUNTRY IS

1297
00:32:38,566 --> 00:32:40,533
FUNDAMENTALLY COLOR-BLIND, THAT

1298
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,033
ANYONE WHO MENTIONS RACE IS JUST

1299
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:42,966
TRYING TO START TROUBLE, THAT

1300
00:32:43,033 --> 00:32:45,033
HISTORIC OPPRESSION IS NO LONGER

1301
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,033
RELEVANT, AND THAT IN FACT, YOU,

1302
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,500
HIS VIEWERS, ARE THE ONES

1303
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:49,166
CURRENTLY BEING OPPRESSED.

1304
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:50,500
AND IF HE CAN SELL HIS AUDIENCE

1305
00:32:50,566 --> 00:32:53,266
ON HIS WHITE IDENTITY POLITICS,

1306
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:54,966
IF HE CAN PERSUADE THEM THAT

1307
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:56,333
THE BIG EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO

1308
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,266
AMERICA RIGHT NOW IS DIVERSITY,

1309
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:00,733
IT SORT OF DOESN'T MATTER IF HE

1310
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,960
SAYS ALOUD WHAT HIS PREFERRED

1311
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,166
SOLUTIONS TO THAT MIGHT BE.

1312
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:05,166
AND WHILE IT'S BAD ENOUGH TO

1313
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,233
HEAR THAT WHITE SUPREMACIST

1314
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,533
FAMILIES GATHER ROUND TO WATCH

1315
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,533
TUCKER TWICE, THE FACT IS,

1316
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,800
MILLIONS OF VIEWERS A NIGHT

1317
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:13,333
WATCH HIM ONCE, AND ONCE IS

1318
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,266
ALREADY MORE THAN ENOUGH.

1319
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:15,933
AND NOW THIS.

1320
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,266
AND NOW...

1321
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,800
A LOOK BACK AT ONE YEAR OF TV

1322
00:33:24,866 --> 00:33:25,566
NEWS WITH PANDEMIC PRECAUTIONS.

1323
00:33:25,633 --> 00:33:27,966
YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED

1324
00:33:28,033 --> 00:33:28,933
SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT

1325
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,466
ABOUT TONIGHT'S NEWSCAST.

1326
00:33:29,533 --> 00:33:32,566
LIKE MANY OF YOU, EVERYONE AT

1327
00:33:32,633 --> 00:33:33,766
CBS 17 IS PRACTICING SOCIAL

1328
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:34,200
DISTANCING.

1329
00:33:34,266 --> 00:33:36,500
WE ARE STANDING 6 FEET APART

1330
00:33:36,566 --> 00:33:37,566
ON THE SET.

1331
00:33:37,633 --> 00:33:38,766
SOCIAL DISTANCING.

1332
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:40,733
THIS IS 6 FEET RIGHT HERE.

1333
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,133
IT FEELS LIKE I HAVE TO SHOUT

1334
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:43,533
OUT YOU KNOW.

1335
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,600
I KNOW.

1336
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:46,200
WE HAVE MICROPHONES AND WE

1337
00:33:46,266 --> 00:33:46,400
DON'T.

1338
00:33:46,466 --> 00:33:48,166
I'M COMING TO YOU LIVE THIS

1339
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:49,600
MORNING FOR MY OWN HOME.

1340
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:51,033
YOU LOOK GREAT SITTING THERE

1341
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,600
SET UP AT A STUDIO AT HOME.

1342
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:55,666
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

1343
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:57,000
OLIVIA IS CALLING.

1344
00:33:57,066 --> 00:33:58,233
SOMEBODY ANSWER OLIVIA.

1345
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,733
WE CAN SAY HI.

1346
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,633
WERE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND

1347
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,433
APOLOGIZE.

1348
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,400
MY ALEXA IS GOING OFF.

1349
00:34:05,466 --> 00:34:05,900
ALEXA COME OFF.

1350
00:34:05,966 --> 00:34:07,600
THE DOWNSTREAM EFFECT IS

1351
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:08,776
PLAYING OUT ACROSS THE SYSTEM.

1352
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,366
I'M SORRY, YOU ARE HEARING MY

1353
00:34:10,433 --> 00:34:12,200
DOG BARK AT THE MAILMAN.

1354
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:13,966
IT'S BEEN A WEEK, THIS IS THE

1355
00:34:14,033 --> 00:34:15,733
CAT, THAT'S THE PERKS OF WORKING

1356
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,000
FROM HOME.

1357
00:34:16,066 --> 00:34:18,000
THE MAPS AREN'T GOING TO MOVE

1358
00:34:18,066 --> 00:34:19,209
BECAUSE HE WHACKED THE COMPUTER

1359
00:34:19,233 --> 00:34:20,433
WITH HIS HEAD.

1360
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,200
LET ME VERBALIZE THE FORECAST.

1361
00:34:22,266 --> 00:34:23,733
62 IN PASADENA.

1362
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,133
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE STORM.

1363
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,966
HE WALKS NOW, GUYS.

1364
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:28,866
I'VE LOST ALL CONTROL.

1365
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,000
SORRY.

1366
00:34:31,066 --> 00:34:31,200
YEAH.

1367
00:34:31,266 --> 00:34:34,966
YOU CAN HAVE BISCUITS.

1368
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,566
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

1369
00:34:36,633 --> 00:34:38,900
RUN TO THE SUPREME COURT AS

1370
00:34:38,966 --> 00:34:40,800
THEY HAVE INDICATED, CLEARLY,

1371
00:34:40,866 --> 00:34:41,633
THAT HAS FAILED.

1372
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,100
THEY HAVE REFUSED TO INTERVIEW

1373
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:44,800
AND ULTIMATELY THOSE BALLOTS

1374
00:34:44,866 --> 00:34:45,666
WILL BE COUNTED.

1375
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:46,266
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

1376
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:47,266
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:48,166
