00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,000
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,040
SEASON VIII
EPISODE 2

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,960
Hi there ! Welcome to the show,
still stuck in this blank void,

4
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,840
TV's greatest celebration of white
emptiness since "Emily in Paris."

5
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,600
It's been an unpleasant week,
from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,640
admitting to withholding information
about Covid deaths in nursing homes,

7
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,680
to the release
of grim unemployment numbers,

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,320
to the death of Rush Limbaugh,
so, you know...

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,320
But we are gonna start tonight
with this.

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,800
Nationwide misery. Nasty weather
pummeling the entire country.

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,400
More than 200 million Americans
on alert coast to coast,

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,360
snow and ice sending big rigs
out of control on the roads.

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,720
In Nashville, home security video

14
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,200
captures a truck sliding sideways
down a residential street.

15
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,000
I know that truck is slow-motion
Tokyo drifting 'cause the road is icy,

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,160
but I also like to think that it had
had enough and is peacing out there.

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,360
"Don, Sheryl,
you've been perfectly fine owners,

18
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,560
but there has got to be more
to life than this,

19
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,920
so frankly, I'm out of here.
This neighborhood sucks."

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,800
Severe winter weather
caused chaos across the country,

21
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,120
and nowhere more so than Texas.

22
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,120
Day five
of the power crisis in Texas.

23
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,080
We could tell you how cold it is,
but these images tell the story better.

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,200
Burst pipes caused icicles
on this ceiling fan.

25
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,040
Took, look at this, yep, that's ice
coming out of this bathroom faucet.

26
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,960
And check out
this car wash in Austin.

27
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,680
The person who posted this picture
summed it up pretty well saying,

28
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,320
"Guess I'll wait 'til next week."

29
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,800
Yeah, maybe wait until your car wash
stops looking like a middle school

30
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,040
went over budget
on their production of "Frozen."

31
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,960
You probably shouldn't be driving
into something

32
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,040
that looks like the asshole
of Sully from "Monsters, Inc."

33
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,840
Texas saw a full-blown
humanitarian crisis this week,

34
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,200
with many losing electricity
and access to clean water,

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,480
hospitals having to evacuate patients,
and dozens of deaths.

36
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,040
And if you watched Fox News,
there was one culprit for all of this:

37
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
green energy.

38
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,280
Because multiple hosts placed the
blame firmly on frozen wind turbines,

39
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,280
and none more loudly than this guy.

40
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,480
The windmills failed like
the silly fashion accessories they are

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,240
and people in Texas died.

42
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,920
Green energy means
a less reliable power grid, period.

43
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,280
It means failures like the ones
we're seeing now in Texas.

44
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,360
That's not a talking point,
it's not a political slogan,

45
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,080
we're not taking money
from ExxonMobil to say it.

46
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,320
Again, that is true.
It's science.

47
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,960
First, we know ExxonMobil
is not paying you. Almost no one is.

48
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,600
Your show's lost so many advertisers,
you're basically being bankrolled

49
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,240
by a man in a sexual relationship
with a pillow.

50
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,320
Second, just 'cause you loudly insist
something "is science"

51
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,000
doesn't make it science,
that's science !

52
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,920
And finally, calling windmills "silly
fashion accessories" is just absurd.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,520
The only time you could
conceivably make that claim

54
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,240
was when
the "Bachelor" contestant Deandra

55
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,880
dressed up as a windmill
for her night one entrance

56
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,960
in a clear allusion to Peter
and Hannah's fantasy suite fuckfest.

57
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,960
And even then,
it's not silly, it's horny.

58
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,440
Those windmill claims
were even repeated

59
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,520
by Texas governor Greg Abbott,
who told Sean Hannity,

60
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,840
"This shows how the Green New Deal
would be a deadly deal."

61
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
But he knows that's horseshit.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,280
Texas only relies on wind power
for about 25% of its electricity.

63
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,040
The vast majority
comes from thermal heat sources

64
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,120
like natural gas, coal, and nuclear.

65
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,360
And all of those were utterly
hobbled by the cold this week.

66
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,600
Even if every wind turbine in Texas
had kept spinning,

67
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,280
the state still
would have been in deep shit.

68
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,680
And there were some uniquely
Texan issues at work here

69
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,800
that made this the calamity it was,
starting with this.

70
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,280
Most of Texas runs on its power grid
separate from the rest of the country.

71
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,240
State leaders designed it this way
to avoid federal regulation.

72
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,800
Yeah, it's true !

73
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,000
Texas is the only state in the lower 48
not on the federal power grid.

74
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,160
And sometimes, when you're the only
one doing something, you're a pioneer.

75
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,360
But sometimes,
you might be an idiot.

76
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,840
If you're the only person
trying to set the world record

77
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,880
for being covered in the most bees,
maybe ask yourself,

78
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,040
"What am I trying to prove here ?
Why am I like this ?"

79
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,520
Because that independence
meant that Texas

80
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,760
was limited in its ability to import
energy from neighboring states.

81
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,840
And it also meant that there was
significant pressure on ERCOT,

82
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,000
the company
that manages the state's grid.

83
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,160
ERCOT scrambled
to meet surging demand

84
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,280
and have since admitted that Texas
was "seconds and minutes" away

85
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,800
from catastrophic
month-long blackouts.

86
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,120
Which is a big shift from how
they were talking last weekend,

87
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,360
when they were having fun tweeting out
passive-aggressive energy-saving hints:

88
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,760
"Unplug the fancy new appliances
you bought during the pandemic

89
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,360
and only used once."

90
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,240
And I'm sorry. But a KitchenAid
Artisan Design Series 5

91
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,600
Quart Tilt-Head Stand Mixer
with glass bowl

92
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,280
is not just a fancy appliance.

93
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,560
It's got 10 speeds and comes with a
beater, dough hook, and a wire whisk.

94
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,160
No one's using that once.

95
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,160
Your children are gonna
be fighting over that when you die.

96
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,040
Also, not to be a total bitch here,
but who took that photo ?

97
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,880
The framing's trash,
you can barely see the plug.

98
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,240
It looks like Martha Stewart's social
media before she hired a food stylist.

99
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,400
We remember those days, Martha.
Your shit was vile back then.

100
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,040
The point is,
ERCOT was not prepared for this storm.

101
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,160
But they also weren't alone in that.

102
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,920
Because while ERCOT
manages the grid,

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,880
it doesn't actually manage the power
companies that supply it.

104
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,000
So, it could not compel companies
to winterize facilities

105
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,160
so they wouldn't go down
during a storm.

106
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,160
The state had left that choice
up to power companies,

107
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,400
many of which
opted against the upgrades,

108
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,840
because they were expensive.

109
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,440
And while this storm was unusually
strong, it also wasn't unprecedented.

110
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,560
10 years ago, Texas was hit with
a storm that paralyzed the state.

111
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,360
After which, federal regulators
warned that their power plants

112
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,960
needed to winterize
to prevent this happening again.

113
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,520
And state officials knew full well
what might happen if they didn't act.

114
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,080
We've got to learn from it and make
sure that when this happens again,

115
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,240
whether it's one year from now,
10 years from now,

116
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,360
we do not have this happen again.

117
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,160
There's really no excuse,
in my humble opinion,

118
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,040
that a facility should go off when you
know it's gonna freeze a week out.

119
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,120
That hearing was 10 years
to the day before this storm hit.

120
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,080
So Texas had a decade to prepare,
and it just didn't.

121
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,200
And you can get a lot done
in 10 years !

122
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,800
Look at Beyoncé.
In the last decade,

123
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,200
she announced she was pregnant
in the coolest way possible,

124
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,920
performed at two
Super Bowl halftimes,

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,080
watched Solange
kick the shit out of her husband

126
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,640
and then made a whole album
about it,

127
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,800
invented the color yellow and founded
the Coachella Music Festival,

128
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,520
and was in a film
with the world's greatest actor.

129
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,920
She got a lot done.

130
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,720
She probably could've winterized
Texas' power plants as well,

131
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,480
if anyone had just thought to ask her.

132
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,160
So much of the problem this week

133
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,760
stemmed from Texas's state philosophy
of every man for himself.

134
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,480
And that attitude has defined
the response from their officials, too.

135
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,000
One mayor even posted, "No one owes
you are your family anything,

136
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,120
nor is it the local
government's responsibility

137
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,880
to support you during trying
times like this !"

138
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,160
The backlash to that was so ferocious,
he had to resign.

139
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,400
And then, there was the saga
of Ted fucking Cruz.

140
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,400
He fled the state on Wednesday
and took his family to Cancún.

141
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,480
And when photos of him
on the plane emerged,

142
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,480
he came back the next day, initially
implying that his plan had always been

143
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,800
to drop his family off
and then come back,

144
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,920
a claim that never really rang true,
considering he'd packed this suitcase.

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,840
Sure enough, he eventually admitted
that he'd planned to stay the whole time

146
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,040
and blamed his
preteen daughters for the trip,

147
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,720
saying that they had asked him to go,
and I was "trying to be a dad."

148
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,680
Because the first rule
of fatherhood is

149
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,640
"Throw your daughters under the bus
at the first opportunity."

150
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,520
But eventually, we did get the full
story of how the trip happened,

151
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,040
in spectacular fashion,

152
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,640
as Heidi Cruz's group chat
with her friends and neighbors leaked.

153
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,840
Mrs. Cruz telling friends
her house was freezing,

154
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,920
proposing a vacation until Sunday

155
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,920
and inviting others to join the
Cruzes at the Ritz Carlton in Cancún

156
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,560
where they'd stayed before.

157
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,160
She floated a "direct flight"
and "hotels with capacity. Seriously."

158
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,640
That's just incredible.

159
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,520
Ted Cruz, who, remember,
wants to be president,

160
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,760
told the world he was bullied
into international travel by tweens,

161
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,960
then got cyberbullied into
coming home by the internet,

162
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,880
leaving his wife to solo-parent
two kids on vacation

163
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,760
in another country while trying to figure
out who in her mom group doxxed her.

164
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,800
It's all amazing.

165
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,200
But maybe the ultimate example of self
defeating Texan swagger this week

166
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,920
actually came from former governor
and US secretary of energy, Rick Perry.

167
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,040
Perry suggests that Texans
prefer blackouts to federal regulation.

168
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,560
He said, "Texans would be without
electricity for longer than three days

169
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,000
to keep the federal
government out of their business."

170
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,120
Oh fuck off, Rick Perry !

171
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,080
Far be it from me to question

172
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,560
the wisdom of a man
who failed running for president twice

173
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,320
and who came in 12th
on "Dancing with the Stars",

174
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,200
meaning he lost to Mitt Romney,
Donald Trump, and Vanilla Ice.

175
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,880
But as easy
as it is to venerate sacrifice,

176
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,480
the thing about sacrifice is,
people have to choose to do it.

177
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,520
And the people of Texas didn't choose
to lose power, heat, and water

178
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,880
for days this week.

179
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,280
This mess only happened because
those in charge didn't implement

180
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,440
critical lessons from 10 years ago.

181
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,400
While I would like to think that they
will learn lessons from this week,

182
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,720
remember who you're dealing with here.

183
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,120
And right now, thousands of Texans
are still struggling.

184
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,520
If you want to help, Feeding Texas
is doing great work down there.

185
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,040
And the people of that state
do need help.

186
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,400
They deserve it. Just as they deserve
better than a pat on the back

187
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,760
for their fortitude and independence
as they shiver to death

188
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,120
and representatives who fuck off
to Mexico at the first sign of danger.

189
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,080
And if you think that's unfair, Ted,
do let me know.

190
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,360
Don't bother calling to tell me. Have
Heidi text it to one of her friends.

191
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,960
I'm sure it'll get back to me
eventually. And now this !

192
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,480
And now...
People Who Went to Harvard.

193
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,400
I don't hold myself out
as some kind of genius,

194
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,680
but I went to Harvard.

195
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,280
I went to Harvard.

196
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,240
I went to Harvard
in the mid-nineties.

197
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,240
I went to Harvard undergraduate.

198
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,320
And I should declare something.
I'm a Harvard graduate.

199
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,320
- I went to Harvard Business School.
- That's right !

200
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,600
I went to Harvard Business School
and worked at Goldman Sachs.

201
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,680
I went to Harvard Business School
and worked at Goldman Sachs.

202
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,920
- I went to Harvard.
- Like I said, I went to Harvard.

203
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,960
- I went to Harvard.
- And I went to Harvard.

204
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,920
I'm trained in economics.
I went to Harvard.

205
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,000
- Who didn't support our troops ?
- At Harvard, I went to Harvard.

206
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,480
I feel like what's interesting about me
is I went to Harvard Law School.

207
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,800
Erica, I went to Harvard Law School.

208
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,600
- I did go to Harvard Law School.
- I went to Harvard Law School.

209
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,280
I went to Harvard Law School
and I believe in numbers and facts.

210
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,320
That number
is from Harvard University.

211
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,840
It's tens of thousands
of Americans a year.

212
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,320
But I went to Harvard University.

213
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,280
Moving on !
For our main story tonight,

214
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,280
we're gonna talk about a product
that is wildly popular in this country.

215
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,480
But instead of telling you what it is,
I'd rather show you an ad for it.

216
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,800
And I promise: if you have
never seen this commercial before,

217
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,040
you will never guess what it's for.

218
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,440
Mom, I think Trippy's
been drinking too much milk.

219
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,400
Somebody help !

220
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,920
Sometimes you don't feel like cooking.
I've come up with new Perdue Entrees.

221
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,680
Fresh, complete entrees ready
in under three minutes.

222
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,480
That took a turn.

223
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,920
And what exactly does Jim Perdue
think he's doing there ?

224
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,720
That family doesn't need one
of your shitty frozen meals !

225
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,960
They need someone to expel the literal
devil from their demented guinea pig.

226
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,440
Perform an exorcism, Jim,
or get the fuck out of their house !

227
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,160
The point is:
our main story tonight concerns meat.

228
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,240
It's what I technically am to any
animal above me on the food chain,

229
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,360
like a bear, or a tiger,
or, if I'm being totally honest,

230
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,200
a medium aggressive pigeon.

231
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,560
If you're thinking,
"This is gonna be a grim story,"

232
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,000
"about the conditions animals face
in factory farms."

233
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,160
You're actually wrong.

234
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,840
Those conditions are horrific,
but they do get talked about a lot.

235
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,680
This story is gonna be about the grim
conditions humans are facing

236
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,840
working in meatpacking facilities.

237
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,160
If you ate meat today,
it probably went through one of them.

238
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,840
And meatpacking
is a highly consolidated industry.

239
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,800
Roughly 85% of beef production in US
is controlled by these four companies.

240
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,440
And more than half of the chicken
industry is controlled by these four.

241
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,280
Their employees are extremely important
to this country's food supply.

242
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,600
And, to hear companies
like Tyson tell it,

243
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,760
they're important to them
on a personal level, too.

244
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,680
We've got the same end goal in mind:
protect our team members.

245
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,320
They're our most valuable asset,
they are our family.

246
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,040
I said earlier that we're a food
company but we're a family.

247
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,240
And that's genuinely
how I feel and how we operate.

248
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,960
Okay. If Tyson's workers
are their most valuable asset,

249
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,920
then their workers
are, by definition, not family.

250
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,240
Because let's be honest: nobody's
family is their most valuable asset.

251
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,200
If you're gonna rank everything in life
by how much you value it, it goes:

252
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,320
number one: your phone;
number two: food, water, and shelter;

253
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,840
number three: Judi Dench,
she's a fucking treasure,

254
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,520
and only then; your family.

255
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,560
That's just an empirical fact.

256
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,880
But it's hard to take Tyson's "workers
are our family" talk, given this.

257
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Stunning allegations
made against managers

258
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,720
at this Tyson pork processing plant
in Waterloo, Iowa,

259
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,440
one of the first to shut down when
the coronavirus raged in the spring.

260
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,800
A supervisor allegedly taking bets
on how many would catch the virus.

261
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,200
According to the allegations,

262
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,600
"the Plant Manager
of the Waterloo Facility,

263
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,400
organized a cash buy-in,

264
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,560
winner-take-all betting pool
for supervisors and managers

265
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,520
to wager how many employees
would test positive for Covid-19."

266
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,480
Holy shit !

267
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,320
That betting pool
might be the most disgusting thing

268
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,640
ever created in a Tyson factory,
which is frankly saying something,

269
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,920
given that Tyson also makes
ranch-flavored chicken chips,

270
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,120
a snack one customer
reviewed online with the note,

271
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,080
"DISGUSTING !
I gagged in front of my child."

272
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,240
That review
is on Tyson's actual website.

273
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,960
Tyson fired seven managers
at that plant after that incident.

274
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,960
But it does speak to a larger problem
in this industry.

275
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,480
Because while companies
have put out endless press statements

276
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,920
about the expense they've gone to
to protect their workers,

277
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,040
workers themselves
dispute those claims heavily.

278
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,520
And they've been hit hard.
As of February 18th,

279
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,040
at least 57,000 meatpacking workers
have contracted the virus

280
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,640
and at least 280 have died.

281
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,160
The broader truth is that the treatment
of workers in this industry

282
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,880
has been very bad for a very long time,
so tonight, let's look at them.

283
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,080
And let's start
with how plants operate.

284
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,560
Most feature
a series of long conveyor belts

285
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,960
with workers
packed closely along the line,

286
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,720
chopping, deboning, or trimming fat,
often at breakneck speed.

287
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,320
Maximum allowable line speeds
in poultry have doubled since 1979,

288
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,480
with workers reporting averaging
35 to 45 birds per minute.

289
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,400
That is less than two seconds per bird.
That's fast !

290
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,640
In the time it's taken me
to explain line speeds to you,

291
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,640
a plant could have processed
five whole birds !

292
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,680
There's plenty of activities
that should only take two seconds,

293
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,760
checking the time,
clearing your throat,

294
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,720
determining the worth of a stranger
by how much you want to fuck them.

295
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,600
I get it.

296
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,360
But safely butchering a chicken
probably shouldn't be one of them.

297
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,120
Thanks to this relentless pace,
meatpacking workers have reported

298
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,280
it can be hard to take a break,
even to go to the bathroom.

299
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,440
Which may explain stories like this.

300
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,800
This is security camera video given
to our sister station

301
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,480
from the Smithfield production line
in Virginia.

302
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,000
In the video, you see the employee
in front take off his gloves.

303
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,480
Company officials confirm the man
relieves himself under the line,

304
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,560
then puts his gloves back on
and continues to work.

305
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,680
The worker at the center of all this
has been suspended

306
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,920
pending the outcome
of the investigation.

307
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,440
That is disgusting.

308
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,200
Yeah. It is. The combination
of urine and pork is a bit upsetting.

309
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,080
One of the reasons I have no interest
in seeing Miss Piggy's sex tape.

310
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,800
But it is not just that that man
urinated under the production line.

311
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,080
It's that he was put in a position
where he may have felt like he had to.

312
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,120
That is actually a problem across
the meatpacking industry.

313
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,400
Oxfam released a report

314
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,200
detailing exactly how grim conditions
can be for poultry workers

315
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,400
with one detail in particular that hit
this local Michigan talk show hard.

316
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,320
Poultry industry workers
are put through such extremes

317
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,040
that they're denied bathroom breaks,

318
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,680
many wearing diapers
during their work day.

319
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,080
I know that people need jobs
and they need to be employed.

320
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,760
But to have to stand in your owný
stuff while you're working ?

321
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,080
My mind is racing
while you're sharing those details.

322
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,200
I'm thinking:
"Surely this is not in our country."

323
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,720
I get the shock there, I really do.
But this is totally our country.

324
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,000
We live in a nation

325
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,480
where hundreds of thousands
of homeless sleep on the streets,

326
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,480
people have to launch GoFundMe
campaigns for medical treatment

327
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,840
and where George Zimmerman
can auction off

328
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,920
the gun he used
to kill Trayvon Martin,

329
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,040
a horrific story which, by the way,
your show actually covered

330
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
in the segment
directly before that one.

331
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,520
So, you guys have been doing
a pretty good job

332
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,080
of showing
how fucked up this country can be.

333
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,600
It's not just bathroom break issues,
meatpacking has some

334
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,840
of the highest rates of occupational
injury and illness in the country.

335
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,840
In a three-year period, a worker
in the meat and poultry industry

336
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,520
lost a body part
or was sent to the hospital

337
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,320
for in-patient treatment
about every other day.

338
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,960
And a lot of this is down
to dangerous working conditions.

339
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,480
Plants are so crowded,

340
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,560
a common injury is a cut
from your neighbor's knife.

341
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,200
And those rapid line speeds can
exacerbate other problems,

342
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,160
such as repetitive stress injuries
like carpal tunnel syndrome,

343
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,720
all of which can leave workers
feeling pretty disposable.

344
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,200
You got 2 000 hogs
an hour going through.

345
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,240
You're covered with blood, feces,
urine. It's easy to get hurt there.

346
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,560
You're doing that same movement
for that same piece of the hog.

347
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,160
And it's nonstop, basically
you're treated as a human machine.

348
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,120
That is clearly terrible. Nobody
should be treated like a machine.

349
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,880
Unless, of course, it is a fun machine
like an immersion blender !

350
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,200
I'd love to be treated
like an immersion blender !

351
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,480
You want me to stay in a comfy
drawer most of the day

352
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,440
and then occasionally come out
to robot-fuck a soup ?

353
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,760
Yes, please ! Look, at this point,
you might be wondering,

354
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,960
how do companies get away
with treating their workers like this ?

355
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,400
Many strategically locate their plants

356
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,280
in areas with few job opportunities
and target vulnerable groups

357
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,480
like former prisoners, refugees
and, especially immigrants, for hiring.

358
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,640
175 000 immigrants work
in meatpacking jobs in America.

359
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,360
They may be warier about complaining
to authorities about mistreatment.

360
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,360
So, many workers are already
operating at a deep disadvantage.

361
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,840
On top of which, companies have been
able to minimize accountability

362
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,240
by gaming the system.

363
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,280
They are required
to report serious injuries

364
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,000
to the government's
worker protection agency, OSHA.

365
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,600
There is a simple way around that.
You don't have to report those injuries

366
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,440
if treatment stays
at a first aid level.

367
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,680
What do you think happens ?
As a GAO report found,

368
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,400
plants offer
first aid treatments on site,

369
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,200
rather than refer workers
to a doctor.

370
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,280
The same report found even workers
with severe injuries like fractures

371
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,800
weren't sent to doctors,

372
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,920
with one worker who developed
a musculoskeletal disorder,

373
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,600
making over 90 visits
to the company's nurse

374
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,800
before being referred
to a physician.

375
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,960
And the workers know the game
that is being played here.

376
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,520
There's a nurse, but she doesn't do
anything for you.

377
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,240
For example, when our arms hurt,
all she did

378
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,000
was apply Bengay ointment
and send us on our way.

379
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,800
It's not even worth going.

380
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,600
I needed to see a doctor,
but they refused me.

381
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,480
I told them, well: "Can I go down
to see my own orthopedics,"

382
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,600
"my own specialist,
my own doctor ?"

383
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,560
They said: "If you do,
we're gonna fire you."

384
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,960
There are lots of good reasons
to fire someone: frequent absences,

385
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,880
poor quality of work, because
they get a little racisty on Ambien,

386
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,680
but wanting to see a doctor really
should not be one of them.

387
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,080
And it's worth noting:
if you do have a severe injury,

388
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,640
it can be hard to get relief.

389
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,040
In theory, you could apply
for workers' compensation,

390
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,960
programs under which injured
workers lose their ability to sue,

391
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,800
but in exchange, can get money to
cover medical treatment and lost wages.

392
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,320
Those programs are run
at the state level

393
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,520
and paid into by companies
who've lobbied hard,

394
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,120
both to hollow those benefits out
and make them harder to get.

395
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,560
Just before Texas overhauled
its workers' comp system back in 1989,

396
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,920
one poultry CEO, Bo Pilgrim,

397
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,800
tried to personally influence
proceedings in a pretty blatant way.

398
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,160
Senator Bob Glasgow of Stephenville

399
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,520
says he's never been offered
a blank 10 000 dollars check.

400
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,760
Not until East Texas Chicken
King Bo Pilgrim

401
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,800
strutted onto
the Senate floor Wednesday.

402
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,200
Senator Hugh Parmer
of Fort Worth says

403
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,120
Pilgrim slipped him either a bribe
or an illegal campaign contribution.

404
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,960
I didn't think he was trying
to give me a Christmas present.

405
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,920
Yeah, of course he wasn't.

406
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,520
Because Christmas presents
aren't typically used as bribes.

407
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,960
That is unless
you're a child of divorce.

408
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,840
Here it is, Billy ! A full-sized
motorcycle, just like you asked for !

409
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,040
I think you should have it
and if your mother doesn't,

410
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,160
well, that is on her !
She's a difficult woman, Billy.

411
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,120
A quick word about Bo Pilgrim.

412
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,000
He co-founded a company
called "Pilgrim's Pride"

413
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,840
and blank checks to legislators

414
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,280
aren't even the most shameless thing
he spent money on during his life.

415
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,640
Among other things,
he had this 37-foot bust of his head

416
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,040
installed next to one
of his distribution centers

417
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,560
and added this second
statue underneath it

418
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,080
depicting him reading a Bible
to his pet chicken, Henrietta.

419
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,680
He also built this hellacious mansion,

420
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,440
which locals referred to
as "Cluckingham Palace",

421
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,280
and which included,
among other atrocities,

422
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,240
this absolute nightmare
of a bathroom that, fittingly,

423
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,080
has the exact color scheme
of a raw chicken breast,

424
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,920
and this nauseating foyer featuring
a painting of what appears to be

425
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,560
two peacocks fucking
above some chickens

426
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,640
while a perverted owl just watches.

427
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,040
It wasn't just Bo Pilgrim
fighting workers' comp laws.

428
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,640
Tyson has taken a lead in pushing
for changes in workers' comp

429
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,800
which have made it harder for workers
hurt on the job to receive payments.

430
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,680
In Texas,
it is now possible for companies

431
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,480
to opt out of paying
into workers' comp entirely,

432
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,640
and write their own rules for how
much workers get for their injuries.

433
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,480
Tyson does exactly that, and when
workers get injured in their plants,

434
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,080
in order to get medical
care from the company,

435
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,360
they must first sign
a document saying

436
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,960
they "voluntarily release, waive
and forever give up" claims

437
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,720
arising from their injuries.

438
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,080
Could you not sign that ? Sure.

439
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,560
But then, your best bet to pay for
medical coverage is to sue the company.

440
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,200
That could take fucking years.
While Texas does now have a law

441
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,520
giving workers 10 days
to consider signing the waiver,

442
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,440
before then, they could
actually be pressured on the spot.

443
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,200
At another company, an employee
who'd had both of his hands crushed

444
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,000
was persuaded to sign a waiver
with a pen held in his teeth.

445
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:20,480
I know that this all sounds very bad.
It does imply that companies like Tyson

446
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,520
don't care about the physical
wellbeing of their workers.

447
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,080
But that's actually not true.
Because they do seem to care much

448
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,480
about the physical wellbeing
of some of their workers.

449
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,720
Employees at Tyson Fresh Meats'
corporate offices in Dakota Dunes

450
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,080
are getting out
from behind their desks.

451
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,360
Looks good, guys.

452
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,040
And into a healthy routine.

453
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,840
Every Tuesday and Thursday,

454
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,880
we offer an onsite fitness class
for any employee who wants to come.

455
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,560
We focused on stretching at your desk.
A lot of us sit at a desk a lot,

456
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,520
so just getting up and stretching

457
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,600
just that little bit of movement
throughout the day helps, too.

458
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,480
We had a workshop on meditation
last week and it was pretty good

459
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,680
clearing your mind and relaxing,
stuff you can do at work.

460
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,400
You know what ? It's true !

461
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,120
Meditation is great
for clearing your mind.

462
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,840
You just have to sit still,
focus on your breath,

463
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,920
not to think about the camera crew
that's filming a piece

464
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,120
about your corporate office culture
that will one day be juxtaposed

465
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,960
with how appallingly your company
treats workers in its factories.

466
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,680
Are those thoughts going
to creep in to your mind ? Sure.

467
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,320
But just acknowledge them,
and return to your breath. Namaste.

468
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,280
The contrast between Tyson's corporate
offices and their plants is stark,

469
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,720
almost as stark as the disparity
between their salaried workers,

470
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,640
over 73 percent of whom are white,
and their hourly workers,

471
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,600
over 68 percent of whom are Black,
Asian, or Latino.

472
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,120
It's just a fun fact I'm throwing
in there for no particular reason.

473
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,320
Ideally, you would want the government
to remedy some of what you've seen.

474
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,720
Unfortunately, OSHA
is woefully understaffed.

475
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,960
As of April, its number of inspectors
had dropped to a 45-year low.

476
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,640
At current staffing levels,
it would take OSHA 165 years

477
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,600
to inspect every workplace
under its jurisdiction.

478
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,280
And even on the rare occasions that
inspectors do get to visit the plants,

479
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,720
the limits to what they're allowed
to do in there can be ridiculous.

480
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,080
In the southeast,

481
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,760
where a huge proportion
of the poultry industry resides,

482
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,920
there is actually a lawsuit
that has prevented OSHA inspectors

483
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,520
from doing broader
searches in poultry factories,

484
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,920
even when they know workers
are getting seriously injured.

485
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,880
In one case, an inspector was told
to put a box over her head

486
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
so she wouldn't see
any safety hazards in the plant

487
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,240
if she wanted to walk through
the plant to investigate a fire.

488
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,680
Okay. Not to state the obvious here,
but "Put a box on your head"

489
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,120
is not an instruction you give
when everything is up to code.

490
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,160
It's just inherently suspicious.

491
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,400
Right this way, inspector.
Now if you'll also just please

492
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,000
plug your nose and spin around
three times, we can begin the tour.

493
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,200
Even when OSHA finds violations,
their power to do anything is weak.

494
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,160
In 2019, the average fine
for a serious safety violation,

495
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,880
a hazard where there is a substantial
probability of death or serious harm,

496
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,520
was just over 3 700 dollars,

497
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,720
meaning it can genuinely be cheaper
for companies to run an unsafe plant

498
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,520
and occasionally pay those fines

499
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,320
than for them to provide
a safe work environment.

500
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,960
All of this came to a head last year
when the pandemic hit.

501
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,960
Companies' corporate workers
worked from home

502
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,480
because it wasn't safe for them
to be in the office,

503
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,080
but the plants were kept open,
despite the fact, as you have seen,

504
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,200
it's nearly impossible
to socially distance on a line.

505
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,240
And when workers, entirely
predictably, then started dying,

506
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,360
the federal response
was characteristically weak.

507
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,960
After six workers from a JBS plant
in Colorado died from Covid,

508
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,880
the company's total fine
was just 15 000 dollars.

509
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,520
And for the family of Saul Sanchez,
one of those workers,

510
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,880
that understandably didn't sit well.

511
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,120
Saul Sanchez worked for the company
for nearly three decades

512
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,080
and never called in sick
a single time.

513
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,960
He was the first JBS worker
to die of Covid-19

514
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,200
and his family says his funeral costs

515
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,760
more than the fine
this company's now facing.

516
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,720
It's a huge slap on the face.

517
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,840
They bring in
over 50 billion dollars a year

518
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,680
and they get slapped with 15 000.

519
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,840
That's what enables those companies
to not care for their employees.

520
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,960
That fine amounts

521
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:32,040
to .00003 percent
of JBS's profits last year.

522
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,800
And if you fine a company a fraction
of a percent of their profits,

523
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,920
don't be surprised when they carry on

524
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,800
only giving a fraction of a fuck
about the welfare of their workers.

525
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,120
Legally I have to tell you:

526
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,560
JBS claims that that fine,
and the government's finding

527
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,800
that they failed to protect their
employees from exposure to Covid,

528
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,400
is entirely without merit.

529
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,920
Not only that, they are even
fighting the claims

530
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,480
for workers' comp survivor benefits
from Saul Sanchez's widow,

531
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,480
and others who've lost loved ones,

532
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,920
their argument being that the Covid
infections were not work-related.

533
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,560
Although, to be honest, that's a hard
argument for them to land,

534
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,240
given that the outbreak got
so bad there, at one point,

535
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,520
they had to shut
the fucking plant down.

536
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,240
What can we do here ? At least
for the duration of the pandemic,

537
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,560
OSHA should implement a federal
emergency workplace standard,

538
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,400
giving meatpacking workers the right
to social distancing and protections.

539
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,240
Longer-term, that agency needs
to be rebuilt and strengthened.

540
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:33,440
The USDA should do more
to ensure lines move at safe speeds.

541
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,240
When it comes to workers' comp,

542
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,120
we should be setting a baseline
for what states have to offer,

543
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,560
'cause otherwise, the race
to the bottom will just continue.

544
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,400
All of this has to be done quickly.
Because things are critical now.

545
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,080
Remember that Tyson plant with
the "winner-take-all" betting pool ?

546
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,440
As of mid-December,

547
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:55,280
more than 1 500 employees
contracted the virus and eight died.

548
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,240
So, if Tyson truly is a family
like they love to claim,

549
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,480
it seems to be a pretty
fucking dysfunctional one.

550
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,600
And when you take all of this
together, the diapers,

551
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,120
the endless trips to the nursing
station, the injuries and the deaths,

552
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,360
you frankly only need to take a peek
inside the way this industry operates

553
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,720
to draw a simple conclusion.

554
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,280
That is disgusting.

555
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,800
Yeah, it is. It really is.
And now this.

556
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,320
Working Remotely Sucks
for "The People's Court", Too.

557
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,320
We here at "The People's Court"
are practicing social distancing.

558
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,560
So, we will be adjudicating cases
from our very own virtual courtroom.

559
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,840
- Gentleman, can you hear me ?
- Yes.

560
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,080
Mr. Glynn,
there's no smoking in court.

561
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,120
I didn't realize you could see me.

562
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,840
I don't know why...

563
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,480
Can I just ask you: the stuffed
animal that's in your hand ?

564
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,560
I'll put it down.
It belongs to my nephew.

565
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,000
The end table is the one that...

566
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,680
You know I can see you, right ?
When you roll your eyes at me ?

567
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,760
Please bring it very close to me,
so that I can read it.

568
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,960
The battery's going low.

569
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,400
Put a charger. I don't want
to end up losing your testimony.

570
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,360
I can do it, but I would have
to go into the kitchen.

571
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,120
I think I see my dog, hold on.
Do you want to see my dogs ?

572
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,800
No, I just want to see the table.

573
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,120
Is there some problem, gentlemen ?
Can you lift your heads ?

574
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,800
Why don't you leave
your hand at your earphone.

575
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,520
You can't leave both hands

576
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,520
'cause I need one hand to bring that
up to the camera so that I can read it.

577
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,960
That's our show. Thank you.
We'll see you next week, good night.

578
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,640
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
