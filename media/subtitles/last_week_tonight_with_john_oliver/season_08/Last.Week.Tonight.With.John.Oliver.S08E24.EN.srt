00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,266
WELCOME, WELCOME,

2
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,000
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

3
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:37,133
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

4
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,360
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

5
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,833
US.

6
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,200
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF

7
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:40,833
THE WEEK, WHICH SAW WORLD

8
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,500
LEADERS GATHER FOR THE U.N.

9
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:42,666
GENERAL ASSEMBLY, MAJOR

10
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:44,833
ELECTIONS IN GERMANY AND CANADA,

11
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,000
AND "THE VIEW" THROWN INTO CHAOS

12
00:00:47,066 --> 00:00:48,366
AFTER TWO OF ITS HOSTS TESTED

13
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:53,166
POSITIVE FOR COVID MID-SHOW,

14
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:54,500
LEADING TO THIS INCREDIBLE

15
00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:54,733
MOMENT.

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,666
I NEED THE TWO OF YOU TO STEP

17
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:59,066
OFF FOR A SECOND.

18
00:00:59,133 --> 00:00:59,766
OKAY.

19
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,009
ANA AND SUNNY HAVE TO LEAVE.

20
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:01,600
AND WE'RE GOING TO BRING YOU

21
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:02,033
BACK LATER.

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,733
AND WE'LL TELL YOU WHY...

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,833
MORE INFORMATION LATER...

24
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,166
IT'S A TEASE.

25
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:05,700
WE'LL TELL YOU WHY IN A

26
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:07,233
COUPLE MINUTES.

27
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,433
SO SHOULD I INTRODUCE THE

28
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:08,800
VICE PRESIDENT?

29
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:09,600
YES.

30
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,233
OKAY, SO, VICE PRESIDENT.

31
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:11,766
NO!

32
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:12,933
NO?

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,266
NO.

34
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:14,500
OKAY.

35
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:17,000
WOW.

36
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:17,533
THAT DOES NOT LOOK GREAT.

37
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,709
FILMING A TELEVISION SHOW IS

38
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:19,200
BASICALLY LIKE RAISING A

39
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:20,600
IT'S UNPREDICTABLE,

40
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:21,966
OCCASIONALLY FRUSTRATING, AND IF

41
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:23,466
YOU EVER FIND YOURSELF HAVING TO

42
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:24,609
SCREAM "NO," SOMEONE IS ABOUT TO

43
00:01:24,633 --> 00:01:29,400
WALK INTO A DEADLY SITUATION.

44
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:31,266
BUT THE WEEK'S BEEN DOMINATED BY

45
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,233
THE EVENTS IN DEL RIO, TEXAS,

46
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,500
WHERE THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS...

47
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:34,366
MOSTLY HAITIANS... ATTEMPTING TO

48
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:35,066
CROSS THE BORDER WERE MET WITH

49
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:35,900
THIS RESPONSE.

50
00:01:35,966 --> 00:01:36,733
IMAGES SURFACE OF

51
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,066
BORDER PATROL AGENTS ON

52
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:41,966
HORSEBACK APPEARING TO USE THEIR

53
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:48,100
HORSE'S REINS LIKE WHIPS TO

54
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:49,600
AS ONE GROUP TRIED TO PASS, AN

55
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:50,366
AGENT SAID THIS.

56
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:51,513
HEY, YOU USE YOUR WOMEN?

57
00:01:51,566 --> 00:01:52,233
THIS IS WHY YOUR COUNTRY IS

58
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:52,833
SHIT!

59
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,300
REALLY?

60
00:01:53,366 --> 00:01:54,433
YOU'RE GONNA CALL "THEIR"

61
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:54,866
COUNTRY SHIT?

62
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:55,500
BECAUSE THEY JUST GOT HERE, AND

63
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:56,433
YOU'RE NOT MAKING A GREAT CASE

64
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,166
FOR THIS ONE.

65
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:58,733
SO FAR, 100% OF THEIR EXPERIENCE

66
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
IN AMERICA HAS INVOLVED A

67
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:01,600
BELLIGERENT MAN DRESSED AS A

68
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:02,533
PARTY CITY PARK RANGER SCREAMING

69
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:10,600
AT THEM ON HORSEBACK.

70
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:12,433
AND WHEN ASKED TO RESPOND TO

71
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,333
THOSE IMAGES, THE BIDEN

72
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,200
ADMINISTRATION FELL BACK ON ONE

73
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:14,700
OF THEIR GREATEST HITS.

74
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:15,300
WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT SAY?

75
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:15,866
HOW DID HE FEEL WHEN HE SAW

76
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:16,300
THEM?

77
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:17,166
HE ALSO FELT THEY WERE

78
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:17,666
HORRIFIC AND HORRIBLE.

79
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:18,933
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO COULD

80
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,866
WATCH THAT VIDEO AND NOT HAVE

81
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:21,200
THAT EMOTION.

82
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:21,733
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

83
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,366
PEOPLE TO KNOW, THIS IS NOT WHO

84
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,466
WE ARE.

85
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:24,742
THAT'S NOT WHO THE BIDEN-HARRIS

86
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:26,166
ADMINISTRATION IS.

87
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:29,400
WELL, HOLD ON.

88
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:30,833
'CAUSE SAYING "THIS IS NOT WHO

89
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,366
WE ARE" ABOUT WHITE PEOPLE

90
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:33,933
CHASING BLACK PEOPLE ON HORSES

91
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,133
IS A BIT OF A STRETCH.

92
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,666
HISTORICALLY, WE'VE BEEN

93
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:36,933
YES-AND-ING THAT IDEA SINCE

94
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,400
1619.

95
00:02:38,466 --> 00:02:39,542
IF YOU LISTED THE TOP THREE

96
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:40,766
THINGS THAT MAKE AMERICA

97
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,066
AMERICA, IT'D BE REGIONAL

98
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:44,566
SANDWICH DIFFERENCES, FLYOVERS

99
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:45,333
AT HALFTIME, AND WHITE PEOPLE

100
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,966
CHASING BLACK PEOPLE WHILE ON

101
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:50,633
HORSEBACK.

102
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,776
I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S WHAT MADE

103
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,066
AMERICA GREAT.

104
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:53,209
JUST WHAT MADE AMERICA AMERICA.

105
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:54,266
AS FOR "THIS IS NOT WHO

106
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,633
THE BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION

107
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,233
IS"... ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE

108
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,500
ABOUT THAT?

109
00:02:57,566 --> 00:02:59,733
'CAUSE FROM AN IMMIGRATION

110
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,433
STANDPOINT, THERE'S NOT A TON OF

111
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,133
EVIDENCE THAT YOU ARE ANYTHING

112
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,033
ELSE YET.

113
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,309
THIS ADMINISTRATION'S RECORD ON

114
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:07,966
IMMIGRATION, PARTICULARLY ON THE

115
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:08,633
SOUTHERN BORDER, HAS BEEN DEEPLY

116
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,033
UNDERWHELMING.

117
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,733
AND THIS WEEK, THEY'VE BEEN ALL

118
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,400
OVER THE MAP.

119
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:16,542
'CAUSE WHILE MANY HAITIANS WERE

120
00:03:16,566 --> 00:03:17,266
RELEASED INTO THE U.S., WE ALSO

121
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:17,900
SENT THOUSANDS BACK TO A NATION

122
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:18,633
THAT'S RECENTLY SUFFERED AN

123
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,466
EARTHQUAKE AND A PRESIDENTIAL

124
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,400
ASSASSINATION WITH NO CLEAR

125
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:21,066
RATIONALE FOR HOW THOSE

126
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:26,333
DECISIONS WERE MADE.

127
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,866
AND IT'S NOT GREAT WHEN OUR

128
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:28,466
PROCESS FOR DECIDING WHO GETS

129
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:29,066
RELEASED AND WHO GETS EXPELLED

130
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:29,700
IS AS HAPHAZARD AS THE PROCESS

131
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:32,166
FOR FINDING THE NEW HOST OF

132
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:39,133
"JEOPARDY!"

133
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,133
AND BY THE WAY, GREAT JOB SO

134
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,400
FAR, GUYS.

135
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:42,300
YOU DODGED GIVING THAT DUDE THE

136
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:42,900
JOB PERMANENTLY, AND RIGHT NOW

137
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:43,466
WE'VE GOT SOMEONE ABSOLUTELY

138
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:43,900
FREE OF CONTROVERSY,

139
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:44,800
MAYIM BIALIK, A PERSON I THINK

140
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:45,400
IS GREAT BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE

141
00:03:45,466 --> 00:03:47,666
GOOGLE.

142
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:49,166
AND THE REASON WE'VE BEEN ABLE

143
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:50,066
TO EXPEL OVER 2,000 HAITIANS SO

144
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:51,166
QUICKLY IS THE BIDEN

145
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:52,800
ADMINISTRATION IS USING ONE OF

146
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,266
TRUMP'S MOST INFAMOUS

147
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,433
IMMIGRATION POLICIES, TITLE 42,

148
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,166
A BULLSHIT MOVE THAT LETS YOU

149
00:03:59,233 --> 00:03:59,766
TURN AWAY ASYLUM SEEKERS UNDER

150
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,066
THE GUISE OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

151
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:03,500
IT IS SUCH BULLSHIT, A FEDERAL

152
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:05,066
JUDGE IN WASHINGTON SAID ITS USE

153
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:07,333
IN THIS MANNER IS LIKELY

154
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
ILLEGAL.

155
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:10,133
SO IT IS NO WONDER THE SPECIAL

156
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,766
ENVOY FOR HAITI, DANIEL FOOTE,

157
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:13,400
RESIGNED THIS WEEK, REFUSING TO

158
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:14,509
BE ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT THE

159
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:15,300
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WAS DOING.

160
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:17,000
AND IT IS HARD TO BLAME HIM WHEN

161
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:17,666
YOU CONSIDER WHAT SOME OF THESE

162
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:18,933
PEOPLE HAVE GONE THROUGH...

163
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,833
NOT JUST IN ORDER TO GET HERE,

164
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,976
BUT IN THE PROCESS OF BEING

165
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,666
EXPELLED.

166
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:23,666
JUST LISTEN TO THIS MAN, WHO WAS

167
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:25,100
PUT ON A PLANE BACK TO HAITI,

168
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:28,366
DESCRIBING HOW HE WAS TREATED.

169
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:30,566
THEY CHAINED US LIKE ANIMALS.

170
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:31,266
THEY CHAINED OUR HANDS, FEET,

171
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,033
AND WAIST.

172
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,366
ONCE WE ARRIVED, THEY MADE US

173
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:35,542
STAY INSIDE THE PLANE UNTIL THEY

174
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,233
UNCHAINED US SO THE JOURNALISTS

175
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,500
WOULDN'T SEE WHAT THEY DID.

176
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:45,466
THAT IS DESPICABLE.

177
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:47,000
AND JUST AS AN ASIDE, I WOULD

178
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:48,733
LOVE TO KNOW WHO MADE THE PR

179
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,100
JUDGMENT THAT SHOWING HAITIANS

180
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,566
IN CHAINS WAS UNACCEPTABLE BUT

181
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:52,466
CHARGING THEM ON HORSEBACK WAS

182
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:54,466
A-OK.

183
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:55,166
'CAUSE THAT PERSON CLEARLY

184
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:56,409
KNOWSTHEY'RE GOING TO HELL, BUT

185
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:57,000
I'M NOT SURE THEY GRASP JUST HOW

186
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:58,700
DEEP.

187
00:04:58,766 --> 00:04:59,566
IT FEELS THAT THE BIDEN

188
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,333
ADMINISTRATION IS FAR MORE

189
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,566
FOCUSED ON "SEEMING" BETTER WHEN

190
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:04,709
IT COMES TO IMMIGRATION THAN

191
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:05,166
ACTUALLY "BEING" BETTER.

192
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:06,633
SOMETHING DRIVEN FURTHER HOME

193
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,466
WHEN, JUST DAYS AFTER HER "THIS

194
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:10,033
IS NOT WHO WE ARE" COMMENT,

195
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,333
JEN PSAKI ONCE AGAIN SAID THE

196
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,433
IMAGES FROM DEL RIO WERE DEEPLY

197
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,033
TROUBLING TO THE PRESIDENT AND

198
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,600
UNVEILED THIS BIG POLICY MOVE.

199
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,466
THE SECRETARY ALSO CONVEYED

200
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:20,709
TO CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS EARLIER

201
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:21,666
THIS MORNING THAT WE WOULD NO

202
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:22,766
LONGER BE USING HORSES IN

203
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,200
DEL RIO.

204
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:26,133
SO THAT IS SOMETHING, A POLICY

205
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,700
CHANGE THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN

206
00:05:26,766 --> 00:05:27,766
RESPONSE.

207
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,839
HOLD ON.

208
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,104
ARE YOU IMPLYING IT WAS ALL THE

209
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,733
HORSIES' FAULT?

210
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,133
BECAUSE, IF I MAY QUOTE MYSELF

211
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,900
AFTER WATCHING BURBERRY'S RECENT

212
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:39,933
IF YOU'RE ONLY FOCUSING ON

213
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,933
THE HORSES, YOU'RE MISSING A

214
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,700
LOT.

215
00:05:42,766 --> 00:05:44,009
I'M NOT GONNA SAY ANYTHING ABOUT

216
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:46,800
IT.

217
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:48,026
I PROMISED HIM THAT THIS JOKE

218
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:48,933
WAS FINISHED.

219
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,800
BUT I CAN THINK ABOUT IT AND ASK

220
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:50,533
YOU TO LOOK RIGHT IN MY EYES

221
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,166
WHILE I DO THAT.

222
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:56,566
LOOK, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION

223
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:57,742
PROMISED A BIG SHIFT WHEN IT

224
00:05:57,766 --> 00:05:58,700
COMES TO HOW WE TREAT MIGRANTS

225
00:05:58,766 --> 00:05:59,809
AT THE BORDER, BUT EIGHT MONTHS

226
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:04,733
IN, WHERE IS IT?

227
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,066
ALL OF THIS IS EMBLEMATIC OF A

228
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,066
LARGER CONFUSION, WITH ONE

229
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:09,600
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL EVEN

230
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:09,966
SAYING, "I DON'T

231
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:12,533
KNOW WHAT OUR IMMIGRATION

232
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,933
STRATEGY IS AT ALL."

233
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,242
BUT WE BADLY NEED ONE, AND SOON.

234
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:17,342
BECAUSE WE'RE CURRENTLY SENDING

235
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:17,933
VULNERABLE PEOPLE BACK INTO

236
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,233
HARM'S WAY.

237
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,309
AND IT'S PAST TIME FOR THIS

238
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,333
ADMINISTRATION TO STOP SIMPLY

239
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,666
TELLING PEOPLE WHO WE ARE, AND

240
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:23,233
START FUCKING SHOWING THEM.

241
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,666
AND NOW THIS.

242
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:30,333
AND NOW, LOCAL

243
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,100
NEWS ANCHORS ANNOUNCE THE

244
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,176
CHANGING OF THE SEASONS THE ONLY

245
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,533
WAY THEY KNOW HOW.

246
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,433
WELL, TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY

247
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:37,666
OF FALL.

248
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:39,966
I'M SORRY, THAT'S NOT HOW YOU

249
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,966
ARE USUALLY SET AT.

250
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:43,900
IT'S FALL.

251
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:47,266
IT IS FALL, Y'ALL.

252
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,400
HAPPY FALL.

253
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:51,333
IT'S FALL, Y'ALL.

254
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,366
IT'S FALL, IT Y'ALL.

255
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:58,666
I JUST WANT TO SAY, HAPPY

256
00:06:58,733 --> 00:06:59,733
FALL, Y'ALL.

257
00:07:02,966 --> 00:07:04,300
IT'S THE FIRST DAY OF FALL,

258
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:05,166
Y'ALL.

259
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:07,066
FIRST DAY OF FALL, Y'ALL.

260
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:08,566
IT IS THE FIRST DAY OF FALL,

261
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:08,766
Y'ALL.

262
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:16,833
THE BRAND-NEW DAY, WE SHOULD

263
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,033
SAY GOURD MORNING TO YOU.

264
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,100
WE HAVE A COUPLE OF OTHER

265
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:23,866
HEADLINES FOR YOU.

266
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:25,933
I'M REALLY PROUD OF THIS FIRST

267
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,766
ONE.

268
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:27,933
LET ME SHOW YOU.

269
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,233
HERE IT IS.

270
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,466
WHETHER HEADLINES.

271
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:32,866
HAPPY FALL, Y'ALL.

272
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:37,300
ALTHOUGH SUMMER AND LEAFING.

273
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:39,866
THAT'S GOOD.

274
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:46,100
I'M REALLY PROUD OF THAT ONE.

275
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,366
MOVING ON.

276
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,333
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

277
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:48,600
VOTING.

278
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:49,333
IT'S THE SUBJECT OF COUNTLESS

279
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,200
ELECTION PSAs, WHICH ARE ALWAYS

280
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:50,733
THE SAME... CELEBRITIES

281
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,666
ESSENTIALLY BEGGING YOU TO

282
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:52,300
VOTE... BUT IN 1988, THERE WAS A

283
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:53,233
STRIKINGLY DIFFERENT ONE.

284
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,500
ALL I'M GOING TO SAY ABOUT THIS

285
00:07:56,566 --> 00:07:57,800
IS, THERE IS A SURPRISE AT THE

286
00:07:57,866 --> 00:08:02,333
END AND ALSO AT THE BEGINNING.

287
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:14,333
200 YEARS AGO, THE

288
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,000
CONSTITUTION OF THE

289
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:17,966
UNITED STATES SUGGESTED A VERY

290
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:19,700
SIMPLE WAY TO KEEP FOOLS LIKE

291
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:23,800
THESE OUT OF OUR GOVERNMENT.

292
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:32,533
A REMINDER FROM MEMBERS ONLY.

293
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,533
HOLY SHIT!

294
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,733
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MEMBERS

295
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:37,933
ONLY?

296
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,766
THAT'S A BOLD MOVE, PUTTING YOUR

297
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:39,500
NAME SO CLOSE TO HITLER.

298
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:40,133
ALTHOUGH, I WILL SAY, IT

299
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,100
ACTUALLY FITS PRETTY WELL,

300
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,242
CONSIDERING "MEMBERS ONLY" WOULD

301
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:42,800
HAVE BEEN A PERFECT SLOGAN FOR

302
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:44,400
THE NAZIS.

303
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:45,706
BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT VOTING

304
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:46,866
BECAUSE, AS YOU UNDOUBTEDLY

305
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:48,100
KNOW, THE LATEST ATTACK ON

306
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:48,866
VOTING RIGHTS IN AMERICA IS WELL

307
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:50,966
UNDERWAY.

308
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:53,933
A NEW REPORT FROM

309
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,433
THE BRENNAN CENTER SHOWS THAT

310
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,166
BETWEEN JANUARY AND JULY, THESE

311
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:58,276
18 STATES PASSED 30 LAWS THAT

312
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,966
RESTRICT VOTER ACCESS.

313
00:09:01,033 --> 00:09:02,433
THEY INCLUDE CRACKDOWNS ON

314
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,600
MAIL-IN AND EARLY VOTING,

315
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:06,600
HARSHER VOTER I.D. REQUIREMENTS,

316
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:11,933
AND VOTER ROLL PURGES.

317
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,400
YEAH, IT'S TRUE, ALL

318
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:14,542
THOSE STATES ARE TRYING TO MAKE

319
00:09:14,566 --> 00:09:16,033
IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE,

320
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,366
AND IF ANYONE IS SURPRISED TO

321
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:19,466
SEE NEW HAMPSHIRE UP THERE, LET

322
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:20,366
ME REMIND YOU:

323
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:21,366
IT'S A STATE THAT'S

324
00:09:21,433 --> 00:09:21,933
88% WHITE WITH A REPUBLICAN

325
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,566
GOVERNOR AND NO ADULT SEATBELT

326
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:22,900
LAW.

327
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:23,976
SURE, THEY PRESENT THEMSELVES AS

328
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,566
CHARMING, BUT THEY'RE BASICALLY

329
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:26,733
FLORIDA WITH FOLIAGE.

330
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,233
THAT IS IT.

331
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,266
AND SOME OF THE BIGGEST

332
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:30,866
ATTACKS ON VOTING RIGHTS HAVE

333
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:31,500
BEEN CONCENTRATED IN THE

334
00:09:31,566 --> 00:09:34,200
CLOSEST STATES IN LAST YEAR'S

335
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:35,366
ELECTION, ESPECIALLY THESE

336
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:36,366
THREE, WHERE BIDEN'S COMBINED

337
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:37,673
MARGIN OF VICTORY WAS LESS THAN

338
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:39,500
43,000 VOTES.

339
00:09:39,566 --> 00:09:41,333
IF THEY'D GONE THE OTHER WAY,

340
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,466
TRUMP WOULD STILL BE PRESIDENT

341
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:45,300
RIGHT NOW, MEANING COVID WOULD

342
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:49,400
BE EVEN WORSE, WE'D BE AT WAR

343
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:51,000
WITH... I DON'T KNOW, LET'S SAY

344
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:53,966
LUXEMBOURG... AND WE'D ALL BE

345
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:54,900
LIVING UNDER

346
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:56,206
ATTORNEY GENERAL MY PILLOW GUY.

347
00:09:56,266 --> 00:09:57,100
I KNOW THINGS ARE BLEAK RIGHT

348
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:57,900
NOW, BUT DEPRESSINGLY, IT'S

349
00:09:57,966 --> 00:09:58,400
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:

350
00:09:58,466 --> 00:09:59,466
THIS IS TECHNICALLY

351
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:02,166
THE BETTER TIMELINE.

352
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:03,376
AND I KNOW THAT THOSE PUSHING

353
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:03,933
THESE BILLS CLAIM CRITICS ARE

354
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,120
COMPLETELY DISTORTING WHAT'S

355
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,406
INSIDE THEM, AND ANY OBJECTIONS

356
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:07,473
COULD BE CLEARED UP WITH A

357
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:10,666
I WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO

358
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:12,433
ACTUALLY READ THE BILL, FIND OUT

359
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
WHAT THE FACTS ARE.

360
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:14,266
IT'S TIME TO TAKE

361
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,300
A CHILL PILL, FOLKS.

362
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,500
IT'S TIME TO READ THE BILL.

363
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:20,233
READ THE BILL.

364
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,766
THERE IS NO VOTER SUPPRESSION.

365
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:26,400
READ THE BILL AND SHOW ME ONE

366
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:27,542
PERSON WHO'S ELIGIBLE TO VOTE

367
00:10:27,566 --> 00:10:28,166
THAT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO VOTE.

368
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:29,233
YOU CAN'T FIND IT.

369
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:30,466
IT'S A LIE.

370
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:32,000
IT'S JUST NOT THERE.

371
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:34,733
ALL RIGHT, WELL, IF

372
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,900
THAT IS YOUR CRITERIA, YOU

373
00:10:35,966 --> 00:10:38,800
OBVIOUSLY WIN.

374
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:40,200
OF COURSE NO ONE IS GOING TO

375
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:42,166
FIND A BILL THAT LITERALLY SAYS

376
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:42,966
"THIS SPECIFIC PERSON SHOULDN'T

377
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:45,300
BE ALLOWED TO VOTE."

378
00:10:45,366 --> 00:10:45,900
EVEN THOUGH WE ALL KNOW THERE

379
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:46,466
IS SOMEONE WHO SHOULDN'T BE

380
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:47,100
ALLOWED TO VOTE, AND IT'S THIS

381
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:47,466
GUY.

382
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:48,633
HIS NAME IS BRANDON CARUSO.

383
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,860
HIS FAVORITE PIZZA TOPPING IS

384
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,500
"NO SAUCE," HIS FAVORITE SEASON

385
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,933
OF "THE WIRE" IS "I HAVEN'T

386
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,300
WATCHED IT YET," AND HIS LIST OF

387
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:54,300
CELEBRITIES HE'D HAVE SEX WITH

388
00:10:54,366 --> 00:10:55,433
OUTSIDE OF MARRIAGE IS,

389
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,300
EXCLUSIVELY, FIVE TIMES,

390
00:10:56,366 --> 00:10:57,033
THE WHEEL FROM

391
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,133
"WHEEL OF FORTUNE."

392
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,600
NOT VANNA.

393
00:10:59,666 --> 00:10:59,833
NOT PAT.

394
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,600
THE WHEEL.

395
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,233
FIVE TIMES.

396
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,533
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE.

397
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,000
BRANDON.

398
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,833
BUT THE THING IS, IF YOU DO

399
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,200
ACTUALLY READ THESE BILLS, YOU

400
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:12,433
QUICKLY FIND THEY ABSOLUTELY

401
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,066
MAKE IT HARDER TO VOTE... AND

402
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,142
PARTICULARLY FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE.

403
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:18,066
SO TONIGHT, WE THOUGHT WE'D TAKE

404
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:19,366
A LOOK AT THE ATTACK ON VOTING

405
00:11:19,433 --> 00:11:22,800
RIGHTS AND HOW BEST TO FIGHT IT.

406
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:24,300
AND LET'S START WITH WHAT'S IN

407
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:25,900
THESE BILLS, BECAUSE IT'S A LOT.

408
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:26,833
FOR INSTANCE, IN TEXAS... WHERE,

409
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,909
REMEMBER, THAT GUY CLAIMED YOU

410
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:29,300
CAN'T FIND A SINGLE INSTANCE OF

411
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:30,733
VOTER SUPPRESSION... ONE THING

412
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,000
THEIR BILL DOES IS ROLL BACK A

413
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,833
LOT OF THE INNOVATIVE MEASURES

414
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,700
PUT IN PLACE DURING THE PANDEMIC

415
00:11:34,766 --> 00:11:36,166
THAT MADE VOTING MORE

416
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:37,233
ACCESSIBLE.

417
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,476
AMONG OTHER THINGS, IT GETS RID

418
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,033
OF 24-HOUR AND DRIVE-THROUGH

419
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,966
VOTING, BOTH METHODS HARRIS

420
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:44,400
COUNTY IMPLEMENTED LAST YEAR.

421
00:11:44,466 --> 00:11:45,566
AND AS THE COUNTY CLERK WHO

422
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:46,742
OVERSAW THAT ELECTION POINTS

423
00:11:46,766 --> 00:11:48,066
OUT, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

424
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,833
PRECINCTS WHERE THOSE METHODS

425
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,433
WERE MOST POPULAR, IT'S CLEAR

426
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,366
THE HARM IS PRETTY TARGETED.

427
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:54,666
WHY ARE WE TAKING 24-HOUR

428
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:55,733
VOTING AWAY?

429
00:11:55,766 --> 00:11:58,033
BECAUSE 56% OF VOTERS IN

430
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,933
NOVEMBER WHO USED 24-HOUR VOTING

431
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,933
WERE PEOPLE OF COLOR.

432
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,100
AND THEY KNOW THAT.

433
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,066
WHY ARE WE TAKING DRIVE-THROUGH

434
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:05,233
VOTING AWAY?

435
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,533
BECAUSE 53% OF THOSE VOTERS IN

436
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,433
2020 WERE PEOPLE OF COLOR.

437
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,033
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY

438
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,166
OBVIOUS WHO YOU'RE TARGETING

439
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:14,933
THERE.

440
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,033
THEY MIGHT AS WELL SAY,

441
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,466
"YOU CAN'T ARRIVE AT A POLLING

442
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:18,433
PLACE EXHIBITING A FACE IN THE

443
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,733
FENTY 300s OR HIGHER."

444
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,500
SURE, YOU'RE NOT "SAYING" PEOPLE

445
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:24,233
OF COLOR, BUT WE ALL KNOW WHAT

446
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,266
THE FUCK IS HAPPENING.

447
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,200
AND IT'S NOT JUST DRIVE-THROUGH

448
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:30,766
VOTING... TEXAS, AND ALL THESE

449
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,133
OTHER STATES, HAVE ADDED NEW

450
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,366
BARRIERS TO VOTING BY MAIL,

451
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:34,000
COINCIDENTALLY, JUST A YEAR

452
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:35,666
AFTER ELECTIONS IN WHICH THE

453
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:37,600
PERCENTAGE OF BLACK PEOPLE WHO

454
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,233
VOTED BY MAIL SURGED PAST

455
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,533
WHITE VOTERS.

456
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,300
MEANWHILE, ALL THESE STATES HAVE

457
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:43,800
PUT HARSHER VOTER I.D.

458
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:45,200
REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE, EVEN

459
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,833
THOUGH FEDERAL COURT CASES FOUND

460
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,533
BLACK AND LATINO VOTERS IN

461
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,866
STATES WITH HARSH LAWS

462
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:50,566
DISPROPORTIONATELY LACKED ACCESS

463
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:51,966
TO THE TYPE OF PHOTO IDS

464
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:54,066
REQUIRED TO VOTE.

465
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:56,700
SO ALREADY, WHEN YOU DO READ

466
00:12:56,766 --> 00:12:59,500
THESE BILLS, YOU FIND SOME SHIT

467
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:01,533
IN PLAIN VIEW.

468
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,266
IT'S LIKE A SECOND GRADER

469
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,700
PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK.

470
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:05,066
YOU'RE BIGGER THAN THE COFFEE

471
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:08,033
TABLE, BUD.

472
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,566
I CAN SEE YOUR FEET, HANDS,

473
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:10,709
FULL FACE, AND YOU'RE GIGGLING

474
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:11,733
VERY LOUDLY.

475
00:13:11,766 --> 00:13:13,866
YOU DIDN'T DO A GOOD JOB AT

476
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:14,266
HIDING.

477
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,700
AND SOME OF THOSE PUSHING THESE

478
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:16,766
BILLS... LIKE THIS STATE

479
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,400
REPRESENTATIVE FROM GEORGIA...

480
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:19,866
EVEN ARGUE THAT, IF A LAW DOES

481
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,933
MAKE IT HARDER TO VOTE, THAT'S

482
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,733
NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING.

483
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,976
I DO BELIEVE THAT VOTING IN

484
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,366
THIS COUNTRY IS A PRIVILEGE

485
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,100
AND...

486
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,000
IT'S A RIGHT.

487
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:32,533
AND IT'S A RIGHT AS WELL.

488
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,500
BUT IT OUGHT TO MEAN ENOUGH

489
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:36,000
WHERE YOU CAN PUT FORTH A LITTLE

490
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,400
BIT OF EFFORT IN TRYING TO CAST

491
00:13:38,466 --> 00:13:38,700
YOUR BALLOT.

492
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:39,933
OKAY, EXCEPT SOMETHING

493
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,500
CAN'T BE A RIGHT AND A PRIVILEGE

494
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:48,866
THAT YOU NEED TO WORK FOR.

495
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:50,700
BECAUSE THOSE ARE TWO COMPLETELY

496
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:51,533
DIFFERENT THINGS... FOR

497
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:51,900
INSTANCE, IT'S A

498
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:53,066
RIGHT FOR BRANDON CARUSO TO

499
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:53,933
IMAGINE WHAT HOT, TAWDRY SEX

500
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,766
WITH THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE WOULD

501
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,000
BE LIKE.

502
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:55,933
TO IMAGINE CLIMBING ON TOP OF IT

503
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,400
AND TAKING HER ALL IN.

504
00:13:56,466 --> 00:13:57,033
TO THINK ABOUT THE CROWD

505
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,000
WATCHING HIM... YEAH, THAT'S

506
00:13:58,066 --> 00:13:58,733
RIGHT, THE STUDIO AUDIENCE IS

507
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,033
THERE, AND THEY'RE ROOTING FOR

508
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,633
HIM.

509
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,866
BECAUSE HE DID IT.

510
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:04,033
BRANDON FINALLY DID IT.

511
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,633
HE'S FINALLY FUCKING THE WHEEL.

512
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,400
IMAGINING HOW GOOD THAT'D FEEL

513
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:09,833
IS BRANDON'S RIGHT.

514
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,976
BUT ACTUALLY GETTING TO GRAB

515
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,933
THOSE PEGS AND GIVE THE WHEEL A

516
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,066
SPIN?

517
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:16,176
THAT IS A PRIVILEGE THAT SHOULD

518
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,566
TAKE YEARS OF EFFORT.

519
00:14:17,633 --> 00:14:18,433
AND LOOK, NONE OF THIS IS

520
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,933
ANYTHING NEW.

521
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,433
REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN PUSHING

522
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,000
RESTRICTIVE VOTING LAWS FOR

523
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:23,900
YEARS.

524
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:25,433
BACK IN 2013, NORTH CAROLINA

525
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,800
CRAFTED A LAW THAT MADE IT SO

526
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,266
THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE FORMS OF

527
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,700
VOTER I.D. WERE THE ONES

528
00:14:29,766 --> 00:14:31,500
DISPROPORTIONATELY USED BY WHITE

529
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:32,700
PEOPLE, IN A BILL A FEDERAL

530
00:14:32,766 --> 00:14:34,200
APPEALS COURT LATER SAID

531
00:14:34,266 --> 00:14:35,306
TARGETED "AFRICAN-AMERICAN

532
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,533
VOTERS WITH ALMOST SURGICAL

533
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,800
PRECISION."

534
00:14:39,866 --> 00:14:41,076
WHICH HAS TO BE THE SECOND-WORST

535
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,366
CONTEXT IN WHICH TO HEAR THAT

536
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:44,200
PHRASE, TOPPED ONLY BY

537
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:50,600
"SURGERY."

538
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,000
"LOOK, MA'AM, YOUR HUSBAND'S

539
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:52,933
SURGERY WAS...

540
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,076
WE GOT IN THERE WITH 'ALMOST'

541
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,466
SURGICAL PRECISION.

542
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:55,100
MY TEAM'S NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT

543
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,866
YET, BUT WE WERE REALLY CLOSE ON

544
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:57,133
THIS ONE."

545
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,966
AND FREQUENTLY, THESE LAWS HAVE

546
00:14:58,033 --> 00:14:58,866
BEEN HELPED ALONG BY WELL-FUNDED

547
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:00,233
GROUPS LIKE THE HERITAGE

548
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,342
FOUNDATION, WHOSE CO-FOUNDER,

549
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:02,800
PAUL WEYRICH, FAMOUSLY ADMITTED,

550
00:15:02,866 --> 00:15:04,833
"I DON'T WANT EVERYBODY TO

551
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,200
VOTE," AND WHOSE FORMER

552
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:07,166
PRESIDENT, JIM DeMINT, ONCE

553
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:08,966
APPROVINGLY SAID, "IN THE STATES

554
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:09,966
WHERE THEY DO HAVE VOTER I.D.

555
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:10,666
LAWS, YOU'VE ACTUALLY SEEN

556
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:11,966
ELECTIONS BEGIN TO CHANGE

557
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:13,266
TOWARDS MORE CONSERVATIVE

558
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:13,866
CANDIDATES."

559
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:14,633
PRETTY MUCH GIVING THE GAME

560
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,331
AWAY.

561
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,033
AND HERITAGE IS VERY MUCH STILL

562
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,466
AT IT.

563
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:21,609
JUST THIS YEAR, THE EXECUTIVE

564
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:22,066
DIRECTOR OF THEIR SISTER

565
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:22,666
ORGANIZATION, HERITAGE ACTION,

566
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:23,233
ACTUALLY BRAGGED ABOUT THEIR

567
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,540
ROLE IN PUSHING THIS YEAR'S NEW

568
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:27,933
BILLS.

569
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,566
WE ARE WORKING WITH STATE

570
00:15:29,633 --> 00:15:31,133
LEGISLATORS TO MAKE SURE THEY

571
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,033
HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION THEY

572
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,333
NEED TO DRAFT THE BILLS.

573
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,633
IN SOME CASES WE DRAFT THEM FOR

574
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,633
THEM.

575
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,266
THEY HAVE BEEN HUGE VICTORIES

576
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,800
SENDING BILLS ON MARCH 8TH.

577
00:15:39,866 --> 00:15:42,233
LITTLE FANFARE, HONESTLY, NOBODY

578
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,200
EVEN NOTICED.

579
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:44,409
MY TEAM LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND

580
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:46,194
WE WERE LIKE, IT CAN'T BE THAT

581
00:15:46,219 --> 00:15:46,853
EASY.

582
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:48,131
IT CAN'T BE THAT EASY.

583
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,600
HOLD ON THERE,

584
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:50,800
TJ MAXX IVANKA TRUMP.

585
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:51,433
BECAUSE ANYONE SAYING "IT CAN'T

586
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,070
BE THAT EASY" TO DO ANYTHING

587
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:55,680
OTHER THAN SNEAKING THEIR OWN

588
00:15:55,969 --> 00:15:57,930
SNACKS INTO THE MOVIES

589
00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:00,483
ABSOLUTELY MUST BE STOPPED.

590
00:16:00,508 --> 00:16:02,275
THE POINT HERE IS, THIS HAS BEEN

591
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:02,900
A CONCERTED, ORGANIZED EFFORT

592
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:04,200
OVER MANY YEARS.

593
00:16:04,266 --> 00:16:04,866
BUT THE REASON IT NOW HAS A MUCH

594
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:05,800
HIGHER CHANCE OF WORKING HAS TO

595
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:07,203
DO WITH A PAIR OF SUPREME COURT

596
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:09,272
DECISIONS THAT GUTTED THE

597
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:14,560
LANDMARK 1965 VOTING RIGHTS ACT,

598
00:16:14,585 --> 00:16:15,801
WHICH PROHIBITED RACIAL

599
00:16:15,883 --> 00:16:17,383
DISCRIMINATION IN VOTING.

600
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:18,859
THE FIRST DECISION...

601
00:16:18,884 --> 00:16:20,601
SHELBY COUNTY VS. HOLDER...

602
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,842
BASICALLY RELEASED THESE AREAS,

603
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:23,133
WHICH HAD A PRIOR HISTORY OF

604
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,733
DISCRIMINATORY VOTING LAWS, FROM

605
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,100
HAVING TO RUN ANY NEW ONES PAST

606
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,033
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FIRST

607
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,766
BEFORE THEY TOOK EFFECT.

608
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,800
AND THE SECOND...

609
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,433
BRNOVICH VS. DNC... ESSENTIALLY

610
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,633
FOUND THAT EVEN IF A VOTING

611
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,433
RESTRICTION HAS A DISCRIMINATORY

612
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,166
IMPACT, THAT IN ITSELF DOESN'T

613
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:39,733
NECESSARILY VIOLATE THE VOTING

614
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,133
RIGHTS ACT.

615
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,666
THOSE TWO DECISIONS BASICALLY

616
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:43,933
MADE IT EASIER FOR SOME STATES

617
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:45,933
TO PASS DISCRIMINATORY LAWS,

618
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,176
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME, MAKING

619
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,066
IT MUCH HARDER FOR ANYONE TO

620
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,633
CHALLENGE THEM.

621
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,800
AND GIVEN THAT ONE OF THE

622
00:16:51,866 --> 00:16:53,333
DWINDLING WAYS YOU CAN STILL

623
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,066
SUCCESSFULLY SUE UNDER THE VRA

624
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:56,500
IS BY DEMONSTRATING A BILL IS

625
00:16:56,566 --> 00:16:59,200
RACIALLY MOTIVATED, IT'S HARDLY

626
00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:00,533
SURPRISING THAT THOSE PASSING

627
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,400
THESE NEW LAWS HAVE BEEN QUICK

628
00:17:02,466 --> 00:17:04,700
TO SHUT DOWN ANY DISCUSSION OF

629
00:17:04,766 --> 00:17:07,700
THEIR RACIAL IMPACT.

630
00:17:07,766 --> 00:17:09,666
IN FACT, IN TEXAS, IN THE MIDST

631
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:10,966
OF DEBATING THEIR NEW BILL,

632
00:17:11,033 --> 00:17:12,033
THERE WAS THIS INCREDIBLE

633
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,633
MEMBERS, THIS IS A REMINDER

634
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,709
TO EVERYONE TO BE CIVIL AND

635
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:19,000
RESPECTFUL TO OUR COLLEAGUES AS

636
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:21,666
WE DEBATE SB-1.

637
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:23,033
THE CHAIR WOULD APPRECIATE

638
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,066
MEMBERS NOT USING THE WORD

639
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:33,000
"RACISM" THIS AFTERNOON.

640
00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:34,466
LOOK, LOOK, IF THE WORD

641
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:35,866
YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO USE IS

642
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:38,866
"RACISM," I HATE TO BREAK IT TO

643
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:39,500
YOU, BUT YOU'RE DOING A RACISM.

644
00:17:39,566 --> 00:17:40,800
SOMEONE MIGHT'VE TOLD YOU THAT

645
00:17:40,866 --> 00:17:42,000
SOONER, BUT IN FAIRNESS, YOU

646
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:44,166
TOLD THEM THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED.

647
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:46,933
A CONSTANT THEME IN DEBATES OVER

648
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,800
THESE BILLS IS BLACK-ELECTED

649
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:48,633
OFFICIALS POINTING OUT THEIR

650
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,000
IMPACT AND THEIR WHITE

651
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:51,466
COLLEAGUES TELLING THEM TO BE

652
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:52,800
QUIET.

653
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:54,333
IN ARIZONA, BACK IN APRIL, THEY

654
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:01,933
WERE DEBATING A BILL THAT MAKES

655
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,466
IT HARD FOR MANY VOTERS TO

656
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:04,066
RECEIVE AN EARLY BALLOT IN THE

657
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:04,266
MAIL.

658
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,376
BUT WATCH WHAT HAPPENED WHEN ONE

659
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:05,933
LAWMAKER STARTED POINTING OUT

660
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,500
THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS

661
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:07,733
THAT WOULD HAVE.

662
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,800
THE EFFECT OF THIS BILL WILL

663
00:18:11,866 --> 00:18:12,400
MAKE IT HARDER FOR INDEPENDENT

664
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,633
VOTERS, SENIORS, NATIVE

665
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,900
AMERICANS, BLACK, BROWN, AND

666
00:18:14,966 --> 00:18:17,400
LOW-INCOME PEOPLE TO VOTE.

667
00:18:17,466 --> 00:18:18,466
TO EACH OF YOU...

668
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:20,900
POINT OF ORDER.

669
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:21,433
IN 2022...

670
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,333
POINT OF ORDER.

671
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,933
I HAVE 12 WORDS FOR YOU.

672
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,566
POINT OF ORDER.

673
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:25,466
SHOW UP...

674
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:26,533
POINT OF ORDER.

675
00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:27,433
SHOW OUT...

676
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,600
POINT OF ORDER.

677
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,900
AND VOTE.

678
00:18:30,966 --> 00:18:33,800
OKAY, YOU SHOULD NEVER

679
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:35,366
SHOUT SOMEONE DOWN WHEN THEY

680
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:36,200
ONLY WANT TO SAY 12 WORDS,

681
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:37,766
UNLESS, OF COURSE, THOSE 12

682
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:38,566
WORDS ARE, "HIS TESTICLES BECAME

683
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:39,133
SWOLLEN.

684
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,133
HIS FRIEND WAS WEEKS AWAY FROM

685
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:46,033
GETTING MARRIED."

686
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,666
AND LOOK, AND LOOK, I KNOW, THAT

687
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:48,266
OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

688
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:48,833
BUT WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THAT

689
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,933
MAN'S COLLEAGUE READ FROM THE

690
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,500
RULE BOOK TO EXPLAIN HIS

691
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:53,300
"POINT OF ORDER."

692
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:54,233
IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 19A,

693
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,233
NO MEMBER SHALL BE PERMITTED TO

694
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,442
INDULGE IN PERSONALITIES, USE

695
00:18:57,466 --> 00:18:58,300
LANGUAGE PERSONALLY OFFENSIVE,

696
00:18:58,366 --> 00:19:00,100
ARRAIGN MOTIVES OF MEMBERS,

697
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:00,966
CHARGE DELIBERATE

698
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:01,766
MISREPRESENTATION, OR USE

699
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:02,533
LANGUAGE TENDING TO HOLD A

700
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,166
MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OR SENATE UP

701
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:05,800
TO CONTEMPT.

702
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:07,066
AND I FEEL PERSONALLY THAT

703
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:09,333
MOTIVES WERE ARRAIGNED OF

704
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,600
MEMBERS, INCLUDING MYSELF, WITH

705
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,600
REGARDS TO COLORED PEOPLE, BLACK

706
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:15,333
PEOPLE, WHATEVER PEOPLE THIS

707
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,333
INDIVIDUAL WANTS TO SINGLE OUT

708
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,833
IN THEIR ABILITY TO VOTE.

709
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,800
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S CORRECT

710
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:20,781
AND I THINK HE SHOULD BE SAT

711
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:21,601
DOWN AND HE SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED

712
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:22,626
TO SPEAK.

713
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,966
OH, FUCK ALL THE WAY

714
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:24,422
OFF.

715
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:25,762
I DON'T CARE WHAT THE SITUATION

716
00:19:25,787 --> 00:19:26,787
IS.

717
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:29,671
THE SECOND SOMEONE STARTS

718
00:19:29,696 --> 00:19:31,775
READING YOU THE RULES FROM A

719
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,300
WEIRD, TINY BOOK, THEY CAN JUST

720
00:19:33,366 --> 00:19:34,566
FUCK RIGHT OFF INTO THE SUN.

721
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:35,809
ALSO, FOR THE RECORD, IF YOU SAY

722
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,433
THE WORDS "COLORED PEOPLE" AND

723
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,742
IT'S NOT IMMEDIATELY PRECEDED BY

724
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:39,926
"NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE

725
00:19:39,966 --> 00:19:45,133
ADVANCEMENT OF," YOU ARE

726
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,166
OFFICIALLY IN TIME-OUT.

727
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:49,566
BUT REPUBLICANS CANNOT JUST

728
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:51,133
CLAIM THEY'RE NOT BEING RACIST

729
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,276
IN PUSHING THESE BILLS... THEY

730
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,476
DO STILL NEED A REASON FOR THEM.

731
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,733
SO WHAT, EXACTLY, IS THAT

732
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:54,966
REASON?

733
00:19:55,033 --> 00:19:56,400
WELL, FOR YEARS, THEY CLAIMED

734
00:19:56,466 --> 00:19:57,933
THERE WAS AN EPIDEMIC OF VOTER

735
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,500
FRAUD, DESPITE THE FACT ACTUAL

736
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:00,776
INSTANCES OF THAT ARE INCREDIBLY

737
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,066
RARE.

738
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:03,666
SO THEY'VE NOW SHIFTED THEIR

739
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:04,853
JUSTIFICATION FROM SOMETHING

740
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,700
MEASURABLE... WHAT PEOPLE ARE

741
00:20:06,766 --> 00:20:07,776
DOING... TO SOMETHING MUCH LESS

742
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,166
TANGIBLE... WHAT THEY'RE

743
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:10,700
FEELING.

744
00:20:10,766 --> 00:20:13,133
JUST LISTEN TO THE LIEUTENANT

745
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,700
GOVERNOR OF TEXAS MAKING THAT

746
00:20:13,766 --> 00:20:14,500
EXACT PITCH.

747
00:20:14,566 --> 00:20:15,642
I'VE BEEN ASKED WHY THIS BILL

748
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:16,933
IS NEEDED.

749
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,933
VERY SIMPLE.

750
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,040
THE BILL IS NEEDED BECAUSE

751
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,000
AMERICANS NO LONGER TRUST THE

752
00:20:22,066 --> 00:20:25,700
SYSTEM.

753
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,166
AND A COUNTRY WHERE VOTERS DO

754
00:20:27,233 --> 00:20:29,800
NOT TRUST THE SYSTEM IS A

755
00:20:29,866 --> 00:20:34,400
COUNTRY IN PERIL.

756
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,500
YEAH, OKAY, BUT YOU

757
00:20:37,566 --> 00:20:39,166
STILL NEED A REASON TO LEGISLATE

758
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:39,600
AGAINST SOMETHING.

759
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:40,233
YOU CAN'T JUST DO IT BASED ON A

760
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:40,533
FEELING.

761
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,133
IF THAT WERE THE CASE, I'D

762
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,800
PROPOSE A BILL TO OUTLAW

763
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,733
TILDA SWINTON.

764
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,900
WHY?

765
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:45,600
TOO CREEPY.

766
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:46,809
SHE LOOKS LIKE A GHOST WHO KNOWS

767
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:47,733
EXACTLY HOW AND WHEN YOU'LL DIE

768
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,040
BUT WON'T TELL YOU BECAUSE IT'S

769
00:20:51,242 --> 00:20:53,575
MORE FUN FOR HER THAT WAY.

770
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,233
BUT I WILL SAY, DESPITE THE FACT

771
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,100
STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS FOUND

772
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,266
THE LAST ELECTION TO BE

773
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,600
"THE MOST SECURE IN AMERICAN

774
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:00,966
HISTORY," THE TRUTH IS, MANY

775
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:02,266
REPUBLICANS DON'T TRUST THE

776
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,733
SYSTEM.

777
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,633
BUT THE REASON FOR THAT MIGHT BE

778
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,000
THAT PEOPLE LIKE DAN PATRICK

779
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:10,333
SPENT ALL LAST YEAR CALLING

780
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,766
VOTING BY MAIL A SCAM BY

781
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,233
DEMOCRATS TO STEAL THE ELECTION,

782
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,333
AND SAYING SHIT LIKE THIS:

783
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,333
LOOK, WHEN YOU HAVE AN

784
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,700
OPPORTUNITY TO STEAL A VOTE, THE

785
00:21:18,766 --> 00:21:21,266
DEMOCRATS WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

786
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,366
IT.

787
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:24,233
AND YOU CAN SWING THE BALLOTS

788
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:24,633
EASILY, ED.

789
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,742
I COULD GIVE YOU TEN SCENARIOS,

790
00:21:25,766 --> 00:21:26,500
BUT I WON'T, BECAUSE I DON'T

791
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:27,233
WANT TO GIVE ANYONE IDEAS HOW

792
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,066
YOU CAN EASILY STEAL THOUSANDS

793
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:28,933
OF VOTES.

794
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,166
OH, COME ON, DAN.

795
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:32,066
"I CAN GIVE YOU TEN SCENARIOS,

796
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:34,400
BUT I WON'T" IS SUCH AN OBVIOUS

797
00:21:34,466 --> 00:21:35,888
LIE.

798
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:36,953
IT'S UP THERE WITH

799
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,233
"I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND, SHE GOES

800
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,526
TO A DIFFERENT SCHOOL, YOU

801
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:40,690
WOULDN'T KNOW HER",

802
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,733
OR "I'M FIVE

803
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,542
MINUTES AWAY!" OR "I'VE NEVER
SEXUALLY FANTASIZED ABOUT LOBSTERS."

804
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:46,500
WE'VE ALL DONE THAT.
IT'S NATURAL.

805
00:21:46,566 --> 00:21:50,658
THEY'RE STOIC AND TERRIFYING,
THE PERFECT SEXUAL COMBINATION.

806
00:21:50,683 --> 00:21:52,584
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR IF NOT
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY WANT

807
00:21:52,608 --> 00:21:57,495
AND ALSO HATES YOU? THAT'S LOBSTERS,
BUDDY! WE WANT THEIR CLAWS PINCHING OUR

808
00:21:57,795 --> 00:21:59,986
EARLOBES. NOT TOO
HARD, BUT HONESTLY? HARD.

809
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:01,386
LIKE WHEN THE DENTIST SAYS
"DOES THIS HURT?" AND YOU SAY

810
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:04,238
"NO" BUT YOU MEAN "YES" BECAUSE
YOU'RE KIND OF CURIOUS WHAT THIS

811
00:22:04,442 --> 00:22:07,437
DENTIST CAN DO WHEN PUSHED.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY LEGS A

812
00:22:08,832 --> 00:22:09,952
LOBSTER HAS?

813
00:22:09,977 --> 00:22:11,241
I'LL TELL YOU:

814
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:12,566
A SEX AMOUNT.

815
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:14,466
BONK BONK BONK BONK BONK.

816
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,000
BONK BONK BONK BONK BONK.

817
00:22:16,066 --> 00:22:16,933
THAT MANY.

818
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,833
FUCK ME STUPID,

819
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,400
YOU WEAPONIZED OCEAN BITCH.

820
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:22,900
HERE IS FOUR HIT REASONS WHY IT

821
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:23,500
WOULD BE COOL TO FUCK AN

822
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:24,806
ADULT-SIZED LOBSTER ON HOLIDAY:

823
00:22:24,866 --> 00:22:25,400
THEY LIVE A LONG TIME, MEANING

824
00:22:25,466 --> 00:22:26,900
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING;

825
00:22:26,966 --> 00:22:27,866
THEIR BACKS ARE INCREDIBLY

826
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:29,800
STRONG AND RESPONSIVE...

827
00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:30,400
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY

828
00:22:30,466 --> 00:22:31,700
THAT'S GOOD SEXUALLY;

829
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:32,900
THEY'RE INCAPABLE OF RACISM;

830
00:22:32,966 --> 00:22:33,400
AND THEY CAN'T TALK AND

831
00:22:33,466 --> 00:22:34,900
RUIN THE MOOD.

832
00:22:34,966 --> 00:22:36,166
WE ASK "IS THIS GOOD?"

833
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:37,242
AND THEY JUST SORT OF WOBBLE

834
00:22:37,266 --> 00:22:38,366
THEIR HORRIBLE BLACK EYES

835
00:22:38,433 --> 00:22:40,466
AROUND.

836
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:42,133
MY POINT HERE IS, WE ALL THINK

837
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,866
ABOUT HAVING SEX WITH BURDENED,

838
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:44,400
UNHAPPY LOBSTERS ALL THE TIME,

839
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:46,133
EVEN IN WINTER, AND THAT'S

840
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:47,333
WHY WE SHOULDN'T LISTEN TO

841
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,666
DAN PATRICK OR, HONESTLY,

842
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:49,233
WHOEVER IT WAS I WAS TALKING

843
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:54,400
ABOUT EARLIER.

844
00:22:54,466 --> 00:22:54,800
I DON'T REMEMBER.

845
00:22:54,866 --> 00:22:55,266
BUT HERE'S THE THING:

846
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,266
THERE'S A REASON PATRICK CAN

847
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,566
GIVE YOU TEN SCENARIOS FOR

848
00:22:57,633 --> 00:22:58,466
DEMOCRATS STEALING ELECTIONS,

849
00:22:58,533 --> 00:22:59,700
BUT NO EVIDENCE, AND THAT'S

850
00:22:59,766 --> 00:23:00,966
BECAUSE... DESPITE SAYING HE'D

851
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:02,433
PAY UP TO A MILLION DOLLARS FOR

852
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,000
EVIDENCE OF VOTER FRAUD...

853
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:05,233
HE HAS, TO PUT IT MILDLY, NOT

854
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,600
PAID OUT.

855
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,566
AND LOCAL ELECTION SUPERVISORS

856
00:23:09,633 --> 00:23:10,642
THEMSELVES WILL TELL YOU THESE

857
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:12,133
BILLS MAKE NO SENSE.

858
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,066
THE FLORIDA SUPERVISORS OF

859
00:23:14,133 --> 00:23:15,376
ELECTIONS STRONGLY OPPOSED THEIR

860
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,200
STATE'S NEW BILL, WITH ONE

861
00:23:16,266 --> 00:23:18,600
REPUBLICAN SUPERVISOR TELLING A

862
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:19,742
REPORTER, "IT'S STUPID, OKAY?

863
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:20,876
IT WAS A SOLUTION LOOKING FOR A

864
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,700
PROBLEM."

865
00:23:23,766 --> 00:23:24,433
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY ONE STEP WORSE

866
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,670
THAN THAT.

867
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:27,300
BECAUSE THESE ARE SOLUTIONS TO

868
00:23:27,366 --> 00:23:28,654
PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN

869
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:30,000
DELIBERATELY AND STRATEGICALLY

870
00:23:30,066 --> 00:23:31,154
MANUFACTURED.

871
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,666
THE GAME'S PRETTY OBVIOUS:

872
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:33,500
USE BULLSHIT CLAIMS TO STIR UP

873
00:23:33,566 --> 00:23:34,600
BASELESS FEAR TO PASS

874
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,817
UNNECESSARY RESTRICTIONS
TARGETING PARTICULAR GROUPS.

875
00:23:37,478 --> 00:23:39,606
JUST LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED THIS

876
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:41,823
WEEK.

877
00:23:41,848 --> 00:23:43,824
THE NONSENSE "AUDIT" IN ARIZONA

878
00:23:43,849 --> 00:23:47,465
COME TO A HUMILIATING CONCLUSION
THAT FAILED TO SHOW, YET AGAIN,

879
00:23:47,577 --> 00:23:50,566
THAT TRUMP WAS CHEATED OF
VICTORY... BUT ITS ORGANIZERS

880
00:23:50,591 --> 00:23:53,346
STILL RECOMMENDED THE
LEGISLATURE TIGHTEN UP THE

881
00:23:53,371 --> 00:23:56,322
ELECTION PROCESS TO PROVIDE
ADDITIONAL CERTAINTY GOING

882
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:57,199
FORWARD.

883
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:58,866
BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY FUCKING

884
00:23:58,933 --> 00:23:59,033
DID.

885
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,500
IT'S ALL A SHAMELESS ATTEMPT TO

886
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:01,300
GET TO THE SAME PLACE.

887
00:24:01,366 --> 00:24:04,600
SO WHAT CAN WE DO TO FIGHT ALL

888
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:05,791
THIS?

889
00:24:05,866 --> 00:24:07,712
THE GOOD NEWS IS, THERE'S

890
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:08,936
PROPOSED LEGISLATION THAT

891
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:10,044
ADDRESSES MANY OF THE PROBLEMS

892
00:24:10,068 --> 00:24:11,168
YOU'VE SEEN TONIGHT.

893
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:13,514
THE JOHN LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS
ADVANCEMENT ACT WOULD RESTORE

894
00:24:14,376 --> 00:24:16,640
PARTS OF THE VRA THE SUPREME
COURT GUTTED.

895
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:18,661
AND MORE SUBSTANTIALLY, THERE'S
THE FREEDOM TO VOTE ACT, WHICH

896
00:24:18,685 --> 00:24:19,776
WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MAKE

897
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,100
VOTING BY MAIL AVAILABLE FOR

898
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:21,900
EVERY VOTER, MAKE ELECTION DAY A

899
00:24:21,966 --> 00:24:22,966
PUBLIC HOLIDAY, AND MAKE

900
00:24:25,978 --> 00:24:27,212
AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION A

901
00:24:27,237 --> 00:24:28,901
NATIONAL STANDARD.

902
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,130
UNFORTUNATELY, MITCH

903
00:24:31,155 --> 00:24:33,600
McCONNELL'S ANNOUNCED HE'LL

904
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,200
FILIBUSTER ANY ATTEMPTS TO GET

905
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:36,434
EITHER OF THOSE ACTS PASSED.

906
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:40,009
SO IF WE WANT TO PROTECT THE
BALLOT... WHICH WE ABSOLUTELY

907
00:24:40,095 --> 00:24:43,121
SHOULD... WE NEED TO END THE
FILIBUSTER.

908
00:24:43,146 --> 00:24:45,375
AND YOU'D HOPE EVERY NATIONAL

909
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,033
DEMOCRATIC POLITICIAN WOULD BE

910
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,766
SCREAMING ABOUT THIS, BUT SOME

911
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:51,466
ARE DOING THE OPPOSITE.

912
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:52,000
JOE MANCHIN'S CONSISTENTLY

913
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:52,500
DEFENDED THE FILIBUSTER.

914
00:24:52,566 --> 00:24:53,266
AND WHEN JOE BIDEN WAS ASKED IF

915
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:57,000
HE SUPPORTS DOING AWAY WITH IT

916
00:24:57,066 --> 00:24:58,133
TO SPECIFICALLY PROTECT

917
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,733
VOTING RIGHTS, THIS

918
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,700
WAS HIS MADDENING ANSWER.

919
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:03,833
WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO IS

920
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,766
GET WRAPPED UP, RIGHT NOW, IN

921
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:05,766
THE ARGUMENT OF WHETHER OR NOT

922
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:06,633
THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE FILIBUSTER

923
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,433
OR... LOOK, THE AMERICAN PUBLIC,

924
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,666
YOU CAN'T STOP THEM FROM VOTING.

925
00:25:11,733 --> 00:25:12,666
YOU TRIED LAST TIME.

926
00:25:12,733 --> 00:25:14,866
MORE PEOPLE VOTED LAST TIME THAN

927
00:25:14,933 --> 00:25:16,800
ANY TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY.

928
00:25:16,866 --> 00:25:17,566
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORST

929
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:18,333
PANDEMIC IN AMERICAN HISTORY.

930
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,633
MORE PEOPLE DID.

931
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,433
AND THEY SHOWED UP.

932
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,740
THEY'RE GOING TO SHOW UP AGAIN.

933
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:26,533
THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT AGAIN.

934
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,433
SURE, JOE.

935
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,300
MAYBE.

936
00:25:29,366 --> 00:25:30,376
OR MAYBE THEY'LL SHOW UP AND GET

937
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:30,833
TURNED AWAY, BECAUSE OF

938
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,000
EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN TALKING

939
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:33,866
ABOUT.

940
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:34,966
BIDEN'S WHITE HOUSE EVEN

941
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,666
REPORTEDLY TOLD VOTING RIGHTS

942
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:39,833
GROUPS THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO

943
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,942
OUTORGANIZE VOTER SUPPRESSION.

944
00:25:40,966 --> 00:25:42,042
BUT THE PROBLEM IS, IT ISN'T.

945
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:42,333
IT JUST ISN'T.

946
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,560
THAT'S WHAT VOTER SUPPRESSION

947
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,433
IS, AS ACTIVISTS AND ACTUAL

948
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,300
ORGANIZERS WILL TELL YOU:

949
00:25:49,366 --> 00:25:50,733
I'M VERY UPSET WITH

950
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
PRESIDENT BIDEN BECAUSE I FEEL

951
00:25:52,866 --> 00:25:54,866
LIKE HE'S NOT ADVOCATING FOR US

952
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:55,333
IN THIS MOMENT.

953
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,200
WHAT I WANT HIM TO SEE IS...

954
00:25:57,266 --> 00:25:58,733
IS TO STOP SAYING TO OUTORGANIZE

955
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,866
VOTER SUPPRESSION.

956
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,666
I WANT HIM TO SUPPORT THE

957
00:26:01,733 --> 00:26:03,533
ELIMINATION OF THE FILIBUSTER.

958
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,200
I WANT HIM TO SUPPORT AND

959
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:06,066
ENDORSE THE FOR THE PEOPLE ACT

960
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:06,700
BECAUSE HE NEEDS TO STEP UP...

961
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:07,766
STEP UP TO THE PLATE.

962
00:26:09,975 --> 00:26:12,708
WE ARE AT A... AT A CROSSROADS.
WE NEED FEDERAL ASSISTANCE

963
00:26:12,733 --> 00:26:14,803
IMMEDIATELY.
IF HE'S INCAPABLE OF THAT, HE

964
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:19,500
NEEDS TO BE QUIET AND GO.

965
00:26:19,566 --> 00:26:20,400
YEAH, HE'S RIGHT.

966
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:21,100
THE SOLUTION TO BEING BLOCKED

967
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:21,600
FROM VOTING CAN'T BE TO

968
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,400
"JUST VOTE" FOR THE SAME REASON

969
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:25,133
THAT THE SOLUTION TO BEING

970
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,866
LOCKED OUT OF YOUR HOME CAN'T BE

971
00:26:25,933 --> 00:26:26,866
TO TELL SOMEONE "JUST GO INSIDE

972
00:26:26,933 --> 00:26:29,766
AND GET THE KEYS."

973
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:30,876
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING

974
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,033
ABOUT?

975
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:31,800
I'M LOCKED OUT.

976
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:35,533
HOW ARE YOU NOT UNDERSTANDING

977
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,800
THIS SITUATION?

978
00:26:36,866 --> 00:26:37,433
ALL OF THIS IS TO SAY TO JOES

979
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,200
BIDEN, MANCHIN, AND ANY OTHER

980
00:26:38,266 --> 00:26:40,766
JOE WHO WANTS TO SKIP DOING

981
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,300
ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT AND INSTEAD

982
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:44,533
RELY ON THE PERSEVERANCE OF THE

983
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,300
STOP FUCKING

984
00:26:46,366 --> 00:26:47,366
AROUND AND FIX THIS.

985
00:26:47,433 --> 00:26:49,700
I KNOW IT'S TEMPTING TO BANG THE

986
00:26:49,766 --> 00:26:50,600
OPTIMISTIC DRUM THAT MORE

987
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:52,400
AMERICANS SHOWED UP LAST YEAR

988
00:26:52,466 --> 00:26:55,666
THAN EVER BEFORE, AND BY GUM,

989
00:26:55,733 --> 00:26:58,000
THEY'LL DO IT AGAIN, BUT HERE'S

990
00:26:58,066 --> 00:26:59,433
THE REPUBLICANS KNOW

991
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,733
THAT MIGHT HAPPEN... THAT'S WHY

992
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,466
THEY'RE DOING THIS.

993
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:03,773
AND ANYONE UNWILLING TO DO WHAT

994
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,700
IT TAKES TO ACTUALLY TACKLE THIS

995
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:06,766
PROBLEM SHOULD... AND I CAN'T

996
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,009
BELIEVE I'M GOING TO BORROW THIS

997
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:10,100
QUOTE... REALLY BE SAT DOWN AND

998
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:12,466
NOT ALLOWED TO SPEAK.

999
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:14,845
AND NOW THIS.

1000
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:18,182
AND NOW, THE
UTTERLY SPECTACULAR DRAMATIC

1001
00:27:18,207 --> 00:27:19,440
PAUSES OF ESPN'S

1002
00:27:19,465 --> 00:27:22,996
STEPHEN A. SMITH.
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THE

1003
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,666
WINNERS AND LOSERS...

1004
00:27:26,533 --> 00:27:29,733
FOR THIS SUMMER ALREADY...

1005
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:35,621
HOUSTON, YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

1006
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:38,200
SPEAKING OF PROBLEMS...

1007
00:27:38,266 --> 00:27:42,400
I'M PRETTY TICKED OFF!

1008
00:27:42,433 --> 00:27:46,400
OH, AND MY TICKED!

1009
00:27:48,407 --> 00:27:49,941
PUT IT MILDLY, I AM HAVING A

1010
00:27:49,966 --> 00:27:57,966
VERY BAD DAY!

1011
00:27:59,233 --> 00:28:05,166
I AM IN NO MOOD!

1012
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:12,152
SO WHAT HAPPENS?

1013
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:19,866
NOT ONE, NOT ONE, NOT ONE!

1014
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,645
IT'S NOT BAD.

1015
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,670
NOT BAD.

1016
00:28:26,366 --> 00:28:34,366
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING...

1017
00:28:49,192 --> 00:28:53,492
MELO IS GONE!

1018
00:28:54,758 --> 00:28:55,592
MOVING ON.

1019
00:28:55,617 --> 00:28:56,608
BEFORE WE GO TONIGHT, A QUICK

1020
00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:57,466
WORD ABOUT THE OUTDOORS.

1021
00:28:57,533 --> 00:28:58,066
IT'S HOME TO LAKES, TREES, AND

1022
00:28:58,133 --> 00:28:58,933
THE CANDY WITCH WHO LURES

1023
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,043
CHILDREN TO THEIR DOOM.

1024
00:29:01,068 --> 00:29:03,233
IT'S GREAT!
SPECIFICALLY, I WANT TO TALK

1025
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,386
ABOUT ONE WAY TO CONSERVE THE
PRECIOUS NATURE THE OUTDOORS

1026
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,500
CONTAINS, AND THAT IS DUCK STAMPS.
IF YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF THEM,

1027
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:14,000
I'LL LET THIS CHARMINGLY STILTED

1028
00:29:14,073 --> 00:29:16,308
1990s VIDEO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU.

1029
00:29:17,775 --> 00:29:19,308
THE MAJORITY OF STAMPS ARE

1030
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:21,868
SOLD TO WATERFOWL HUNTERS WHO,
BY LAW, MUST HAVE A FEDERAL

1031
00:29:21,995 --> 00:29:24,441
DUCK STAMP IN THEIR POSSESSION

1032
00:29:24,466 --> 00:29:25,836
WHILE HUNTING.

1033
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,800
INCREASINGLY OTHERS, YOUNG

1034
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:28,366
AND OLD, ARE VOLUNTARILY BUYING

1035
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,833
FEDERAL DUCK STAMPS AS AN

1036
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,645
EFFECTIVE, DIRECT WAY TO HELP

1037
00:29:33,727 --> 00:29:35,604
CONSERVE OUR NATION'S WATERFOWL

1038
00:29:35,629 --> 00:29:37,789
AND OTHER WILDLIFE.

1039
00:29:37,966 --> 00:29:39,676
NOW, I KNOW THAT LOOKS
SWEET, BUT WHAT YOU DIDN'T SEE

1040
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,209
THERE IS THE SCREAMING THAT
HAPPENED AS SOON AS THOSE TWO

1041
00:29:41,233 --> 00:29:42,566
KIDS GOT HOME.
"WHAT ARE THESE?

1042
00:29:44,931 --> 00:29:47,725
DUCK STAMPS?
I SENT YOU TO THE STORE FOR

1043
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,808
MEDICINE!
LISTEN TO ME, YOUR SISTER IS

1044
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:51,466
ABOUT TO DIE BECAUSE YOU KEEP

1045
00:29:51,533 --> 00:29:53,600
SPENDING ALL HER INSULIN MONEY

1046
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:57,233
ON BIRD STICKERS!"

1047
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,833
EVERY YEAR, THE

1048
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,034
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ISSUES A

1049
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:03,033
DUCK STAMP, WHICH ISN'T A
POSTAGE STAMP, BUT IS

1050
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,576
EFFECTIVELY A KIND OF PERMIT FOR
HUNTERS.

1051
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,720
THEY CURRENTLY COST $25, AND

1052
00:30:05,766 --> 00:30:07,200
THEY'VE ACTUALLY BEEN A HUGE

1053
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:09,600
SUCCESS STORY FOR CONSERVATION,

1054
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:12,266
WITH 98 CENTS OF EVERY DOLLAR

1055
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:13,700
THAT THEY MAKE GOING TO

1056
00:30:13,766 --> 00:30:14,233
PRESERVING WETLANDS.

1057
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,500
SINCE 1934, THE STAMPS HAVE

1058
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:16,200
RAISED MORE THAN A BILLION

1059
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:17,333
DOLLARS TO PROTECT OVER

1060
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,900
6 MILLION ACRES OF WETLANDS

1061
00:30:18,966 --> 00:30:20,966
HABITAT.

1062
00:30:21,033 --> 00:30:22,166
AND THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE

1063
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:26,666
NON-HUNTERS LIKE TO COLLECT THEM
TOO.

1064
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:27,733
AND YOU CAN SEE WHY.

1065
00:30:27,766 --> 00:30:28,966
THERE'VE BEEN SOME BEAUTIES IN

1066
00:30:29,033 --> 00:30:30,466
THE PAST, LIKE THIS 1960s STAMP

1067
00:30:30,533 --> 00:30:32,000
FEATURING A FAMILY OF REDHEAD

1068
00:30:32,066 --> 00:30:32,933
DUCKS, THIS 1980s ONE

1069
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,300
SHOWCASING A MAJESTIC

1070
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:35,966
SNOW GOOSE, AND THIS MOTTLED

1071
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:37,366
DUCK FROM THE 2000s WHO IS

1072
00:30:37,433 --> 00:30:39,100
ABSOLUTELY RIPPED.

1073
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:40,466
CHECK OUT THE DEFINITION ON THAT

1074
00:30:40,533 --> 00:30:41,666
BACK.

1075
00:30:41,733 --> 00:30:42,809
QUICK QUESTION, DOES THIS STAMP

1076
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:46,200
COME WITH MOO SHU PANCAKES?

1077
00:30:46,266 --> 00:30:49,700
'CAUSE THAT DUCK IS SHREDDED.

1078
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,600
BUT THE BEST THING ABOUT THE

1079
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:52,533
DUCK STAMP IS HOW EACH YEAR'S IS

1080
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,000
CHOSEN... BECAUSE IT'S AN

1081
00:30:54,066 --> 00:30:54,533
ANNUAL, NATIONWIDE ART

1082
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
COMPETITION.

1083
00:30:55,633 --> 00:30:57,133
AND THE JUDGING OF IT IS NO

1084
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,366
JOKE.

1085
00:31:00,433 --> 00:31:02,333
THE JUDGES INDEPENDENTLY VOTE

1086
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,800
ON EACH ENTRY.

1087
00:31:03,866 --> 00:31:05,333
THEY CONSIDER NOT ONLY THE

1088
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,233
VISUAL IMPACT OF THE ART AND HOW

1089
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:12,166
IT MIGHT LOOK AS A STAMP BUT

1090
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:13,066
ALSO WHETHER IT IS ANATOMICALLY

1091
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:13,866
ACCURATE.

1092
00:31:13,933 --> 00:31:14,600
DUCKS MUST

1093
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:15,706
NOT ONLY BE BEAUTIFUL, BUT

1094
00:31:15,733 --> 00:31:17,366
ANATOMICALLY ACCURATE.

1095
00:31:17,433 --> 00:31:19,066
AN ESPECIALLY FUN REQUIREMENT,

1096
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:23,266
GIVEN THAT YOU'RE PAINTING AN

1097
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:24,133
ANIMAL THAT HAS... AS WE'VE

1098
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,866
MENTIONED ON THIS SHOW BEFORE...

1099
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:26,109
A LONG, CORKSCREW-SHAPED PENIS.

1100
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:27,253
IT'S A FACT THAT DROVE US TO

1101
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,409
CREATE THIS IMAGE OF DONALD DUCK

1102
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:29,866
THAT... AS OF TAPING... DISNEY

1103
00:31:29,933 --> 00:31:31,200
HAD NOT YET SUED US OVER.

1104
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:32,200
AND ONCE YOU START LOOKING INTO

1105
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:33,733
THE DUCK STAMP CONTEST, IT'S NOT

1106
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,042
LONG BEFORE YOU FIND SOME DRAMA.

1107
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:36,700
THERE ARE BIG NAMES, LIKE THE

1108
00:31:36,766 --> 00:31:37,966
HAUTMAN BROTHERS, AN ACTUAL

1109
00:31:38,033 --> 00:31:39,200
DUCK DYNASTY WHO, GOING INTO

1110
00:31:39,266 --> 00:31:40,933
THIS YEAR'S COMPETITION, HAD

1111
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,266
COLLECTIVELY WON IT 13 TIMES.

1112
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,166
THEY ARE TRULY THE DUCK

1113
00:31:46,233 --> 00:31:48,100
G.O.A.T.s.

1114
00:31:48,166 --> 00:31:49,933
AND THERE'S ALSO BEEN A HEATED

1115
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,500
RIVALRY BETWEEN ONE OF THE

1116
00:31:52,566 --> 00:31:53,600
REGULAR, TRADITIONAL DUCK

1117
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:54,433
ARTISTS, TIM TAYLOR, AND HIS

1118
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,500
MORE AVANT-GARDE RIVAL,

1119
00:31:55,566 --> 00:31:56,933
ROB McBROOM, WHO TIM TAYLOR HAS

1120
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,166
NO TIME FOR.

1121
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:02,666
ROB McBROOM IS A GUY WHO

1122
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:04,633
ENTERS THE DUCK STAMP EVERY

1123
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,466
YEAR.

1124
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:06,333
AND EVERY YEAR, HE VIOLATES THE

1125
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,666
RULES, HE BREAKS EVERY RULE OF

1126
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:09,233
THE CONTEST, AND HE'S REALLY

1127
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,766
JUST AN ATTENTION SEEKER.

1128
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:12,833
HE'S FOUND THIS CONTEST THAT

1129
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,533
PEOPLE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY AND

1130
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,600
THE CONTESTANTS WORK REALLY HARD

1131
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:18,133
ON THE ENTRIES AND HE MOCKS IT.

1132
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,233
HE DOES PAINTINGS THAT MOCK IT.

1133
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,366
YEAH, TO BE FAIR,

1134
00:32:24,433 --> 00:32:25,433
HE DOES KIND OF DO THAT.

1135
00:32:25,466 --> 00:32:26,233
HE'S SUBMITTED PAINTINGS TO

1136
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,066
FEDERAL AND STATE CONTESTS THAT

1137
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:28,433
CLEARLY GO AGAINST THE DESIRED

1138
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,509
AESTHETIC, LIKE THIS ONE OF TWO

1139
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:30,333
CARTOONISH DUCKS, AND WHATEVER

1140
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,066
THE FUCK THIS IS.

1141
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:34,033
ALSO, ROB McBROOM IS VERY MUCH

1142
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,133
AWARE OF TIM TAYLOR'S CRITICISM

1143
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,266
AND TROLLED HIM FOR YEARS, EVEN

1144
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,900
TAKING PREVIOUS TAYLOR PAINTINGS

1145
00:32:39,966 --> 00:32:43,133
AND PARODYING THEM.

1146
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,600
THIS IS ABOUT AS CLOSE AS YOU

1147
00:32:44,666 --> 00:32:45,866
CAN GET TO TIM'S ORIGINAL

1148
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:47,500
WITHOUT ACTUALLY KNOWING THE

1149
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:48,966
SIZE, AND IT'S COMPLETELY BUILT

1150
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:49,933
FROM SCRATCH.

1151
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,933
THIS IS THE PIECE OF WORK

1152
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,500
THAT ROB McBROOM TOOK OFF OF THE

1153
00:32:54,566 --> 00:32:56,366
INTERNET TO "ABSTRACT."

1154
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:58,333
THE LITTLE BITS I'VE LEARNED

1155
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,500
ABOUT HIM, I'M LIKE, OKAY, HE

1156
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:02,333
OBVIOUSLY HATES BARACK OBAMA,

1157
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,300
AND HE HATES COMMUNISM.

1158
00:33:03,366 --> 00:33:04,376
SO I DECIDED TO LOAD IT UP WITH

1159
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,500
IMAGERY WITH THAT.

1160
00:33:07,566 --> 00:33:08,966
HERE IS BARACK OBAMA'S BIRTH

1161
00:33:09,033 --> 00:33:12,433
CERTIFICATE THAT HE RELEASED.

1162
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,766
HERE'S THE EYE OF THE DUCK,

1163
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:16,617
WHICH IS THE COMMUNIST SYMBOL.

1164
00:33:16,642 --> 00:33:19,476
THERE'S OTHER THINGS IN HERE,
LIKE HE WAS HOLDING A BABY AT A

1165
00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:20,933
CHRISTENING.

1166
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,733
AND THEN I PUT LENIN'S HEAD ON

1167
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,833
TOP OF IT.

1168
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,200
WOW, THAT IS PETTY.

1169
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:29,100
HONESTLY, IF I WERE TIM, I'D

1170
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:30,333
BACK OFF AT THIS POINT.

1171
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,440
BECAUSE IF THIS MAN MADE A

1172
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,100
COMMUNIST DUCK OUT OF YOUR

1173
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:32,833
PERSONAL PHOTOGRAPHS, JUST THINK

1174
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,366
WHAT ELSE HE'S CAPABLE OF.

1175
00:33:33,433 --> 00:33:34,933
"HERE'S ANOTHER ONE, TIM!

1176
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,042
THE FEATHERS ARE MADE OUT OF

1177
00:33:36,066 --> 00:33:37,400
BANK STATEMENTS I FISHED FROM

1178
00:33:37,466 --> 00:33:38,542
YOUR TRASH, AND THE BEAK IS FROM

1179
00:33:38,566 --> 00:33:39,433
A PHOTO OF YOU I TOOK WHILE YOU

1180
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,300
WERE SLEEPING.

1181
00:33:40,366 --> 00:33:44,566
BUT BY ALL MEANS, KEEP TALKING

1182
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:46,000
SHIT."

1183
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,466
THE POINT HERE IS, THE DUCK

1184
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:48,333
STAMP COMPETITION IS INTENSE.

1185
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,733
LAST YEAR, THERE WERE SOME

1186
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,466
INCREDIBLE ENTRIES, LIKE THIS

1187
00:33:50,533 --> 00:33:51,576
ONE OF A DUCK SOMEHOW TRIPPING

1188
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,700
IN MIDAIR, AND THIS ONE, WHICH

1189
00:33:56,766 --> 00:33:59,200
I WOULD ARGUE IS ACTUALLY

1190
00:33:59,266 --> 00:33:59,500
A DOG STAMP.

1191
00:33:59,566 --> 00:34:00,233
A DOG ON HIS WAY TO

1192
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:00,766
A LEATHER BAR WHILE A DUCK

1193
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:01,266
HAPPENED TO BE PASSING.

1194
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:01,766
I'M NOT SAYING THAT AS A

1195
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:02,633
CRITICISM.

1196
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,433
I'M JUST SAYING, THAT'S WHAT IT

1197
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,300
IS.

1198
00:34:06,366 --> 00:34:07,633
BUT THE OVERALL WINNER WAS THIS

1199
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,166
OBJECTIVELY WONDERFUL, VERY

1200
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:08,966
ANATOMICALLY ACCURATE PAINTING

1201
00:34:09,033 --> 00:34:10,073
OF A LESSER SCAUP DRAKE BY

1202
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,700
ARTIST RICHARD CLIFTON.

1203
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:12,500
AND HIDING THE DUCK'S COIL-Y

1204
00:34:12,566 --> 00:34:13,300
DICK UNDERWATER WAS A VERY SMART

1205
00:34:13,366 --> 00:34:14,733
MOVIE, RICHIE.

1206
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,400
YOU CAN'T SEE IT, BUT YOU KNOW

1207
00:34:16,466 --> 00:34:23,433
IT'S DOWN THERE SWIRLING AWAY.

1208
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,533
THAT

1209
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,809
DUCK CALL IN THE CORNER IS ONLY

1210
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:26,700
THERE BECAUSE, UNDER THE TRUMP

1211
00:34:26,766 --> 00:34:27,366
ADMINISTRATION, THERE WAS

1212
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:28,542
SUDDENLY A RULE THAT ALL ENTRIES

1213
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,833
HAD TO FEATURE HUNTING IMAGERY,

1214
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:36,500
WHICH MANY PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE.

1215
00:34:36,566 --> 00:34:39,800
THANKFULLY, THAT RULE WILL BE

1216
00:34:39,866 --> 00:34:40,633
GONE NEXT YEAR, WHICH IS GOOD,

1217
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,533
BECAUSE POTENTIALLY DRIVING

1218
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,840
PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE DUCK STAMP

1219
00:34:42,866 --> 00:34:43,533
IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.

1220
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,266
STAMP SALES ARE ALREADY DOWN,

1221
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:45,033
AND AS YOU NOW KNOW, THAT MEANS

1222
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,333
LESS MONEY FOR CONSERVATION.

1223
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,542
WHAT CLEARLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS

1224
00:34:47,566 --> 00:34:48,806
FOR MORE PEOPLE TO BE DRIVEN TO

1225
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:51,566
COLLECTING THESE THINGS.

1226
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:53,466
AND FOR THAT TO WORK, YOU REALLY

1227
00:34:53,533 --> 00:34:54,100
NEED THIS YEAR'S WINNER TO BE AN

1228
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:57,900
ABSOLUTE DOOZY.

1229
00:34:57,966 --> 00:34:58,833
AND THAT IS WHERE WE COME IN.

1230
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,466
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, ANYONE CAN

1231
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:01,000
ENTER THIS CONTEST.

1232
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:03,200
AND I'M HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT,

1233
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:07,766
THIS YEAR, THIS ANYONE DID.

1234
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:09,600
WE COMMISSIONED A PAINTER TO

1235
00:35:09,666 --> 00:35:12,166
CREATE THIS GORGEOUS OIL

1236
00:35:12,233 --> 00:35:13,409
PAINTING OF A BLUE-WINGED TEAL

1237
00:35:13,433 --> 00:35:15,766
FLYING IN THE NINTENDO GAME

1238
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:21,933
"DUCK HUNT," MEETING THEIR

1239
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,800
RIDICULOUS HUNTING REQUIREMENT.

1240
00:35:24,866 --> 00:35:25,366
THIS IS A REAL PAINTING THAT

1241
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:26,833
TOOK MONTHS OF WORK.

1242
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,466
BUT I'M SORRY TO SAY, IT WAS

1243
00:35:28,533 --> 00:35:29,542
DISQUALIFIED BECAUSE OF, AND I

1244
00:35:29,566 --> 00:35:30,500
QUOTE, "THE RULE AGAINST HAVING

1245
00:35:30,566 --> 00:35:31,166
ANY NUMBERS OR LETTERING ON THE

1246
00:35:31,233 --> 00:35:31,533
ENTRY."

1247
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,900
WHICH IS A RIDICULOUS

1248
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:34,400
REQUIREMENT.

1249
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:35,746
IT'S LIKE IF THEY SAID, "NO DUCK

1250
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,533
STAMP IS ALLOWED TO FEATURE CANS

1251
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,800
OF SPAGHETTIOS OR PAUL SORVINO."

1252
00:35:42,866 --> 00:35:44,166
WHAT HAPPENED IN PAST CONTESTS

1253
00:35:44,233 --> 00:35:47,600
THAT PROMPTED THAT REGULATION?

1254
00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:48,666
SO THAT IS THE BAD NEWS.

1255
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,233
THE GOOD NEWS IS, WE ACTUALLY

1256
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,933
HAD A SECOND ENTRY.

1257
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,766
SPECIFICALLY, THIS PAINTING OF

1258
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:54,400
DUCKS JUDGING THE DUCK STAMP ART

1259
00:35:54,466 --> 00:35:55,833
CONTEST.

1260
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,466
UNFORTUNATELY, WE FELL VICTIM TO

1261
00:35:57,533 --> 00:36:00,300
THE SAME BULLSHIT NUMBER RULE,

1262
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:04,433
AND THIS WAS DISQUALIFIED TOO.

1263
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,000
SO YOU CAN PROBABLY IMAGINE JUST

1264
00:36:07,066 --> 00:36:07,633
HOW RELIEVED WE WERE TO SUDDENLY

1265
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,133
REMEMBER THAT WE'D ACTUALLY

1266
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,400
ENTERED THREE OTHER PAINTINGS,

1267
00:36:10,433 --> 00:36:12,433
ALL OF WHICH, I'M HAPPY TO SAY,

1268
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,066
DID QUALIFY FOR THIS WEEKEND'S

1269
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:17,066
CONTEST.

1270
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,242
SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THEM.

1271
00:36:18,266 --> 00:36:18,766
FIRST, THERE'S THIS ONE OF A

1272
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:19,876
REDHEAD DUCK HUNTING A HUNTER

1273
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,733
HUNTING ANOTHER DUCK.

1274
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,200
HOLD THE OMINOUS, QUIETLY

1275
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:24,666
MANIACAL LOOK IN THAT DUCK'S EYE

1276
00:36:24,733 --> 00:36:26,500
AS HE'S ABOUT TO PULL THE

1277
00:36:26,566 --> 00:36:26,866
TRIGGER.

1278
00:36:26,933 --> 00:36:28,166
IT'S A HAUNTING YET TRIUMPHANT

1279
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:30,466
IMAGE.

1280
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:31,576
SO LET'S SEE IF THE DUCK STAMP

1281
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,033
JUDGES LIKED IT:

1282
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,566
PLEASE VOTE.

1283
00:36:35,633 --> 00:36:36,833
IT'S OUT.

1284
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:39,300
ARE YOU FUCKING

1285
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:40,300
KIDDING ME?

1286
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:41,033
NOT ONE OF YOU JUDGES VOTED FOR

1287
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:47,733
THAT?

1288
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,333
RIDICULOUS.

1289
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
JUST RIDICULOUS.

1290
00:36:49,466 --> 00:36:50,333
ALL FIVE OF YOU SHOULD BE

1291
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:50,800
ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES.

1292
00:36:50,866 --> 00:36:51,200
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

1293
00:36:51,266 --> 00:36:53,200
FINE.

1294
00:36:53,266 --> 00:36:54,342
BECAUSE REMEMBER, WE STILL HAD

1295
00:36:54,366 --> 00:36:54,600
TWO OTHERS.

1296
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:56,133
NEXT UP WAS THIS ENTRY,

1297
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,000
"DUCK WITH A PEARL EARRING."

1298
00:36:59,066 --> 00:36:59,600
WHICH I WOULD ARGUE IS

1299
00:36:59,666 --> 00:36:59,933
EXQUISITE.

1300
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,966
IT MAKES THE ORIGINAL VERMEER

1301
00:37:06,033 --> 00:37:07,166
LOOK LIKE A COMPLETE PILE OF

1302
00:37:07,233 --> 00:37:07,466
SHIT.

1303
00:37:07,533 --> 00:37:08,773
THAT GIRL DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ANY

1304
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:10,666
FEATHERS.

1305
00:37:10,733 --> 00:37:12,300
OR A BEAK FOR THAT MATTER.

1306
00:37:12,366 --> 00:37:12,766
WHAT A WASTE OF PAINT.

1307
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:13,366
SO SURELY, SURELY, THE JUDGES

1308
00:37:13,433 --> 00:37:14,533
LOVED THIS ONE.

1309
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,500
PLEASE VOTE.

1310
00:37:16,566 --> 00:37:20,833
IT'S OUT.

1311
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,766
OH, COME ON!

1312
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:23,400
THESE JUDGES ARE FUCKING CLOWNS.

1313
00:37:23,466 --> 00:37:24,706
THEY DON'T KNOW SHIT ABOUT ART,

1314
00:37:24,733 --> 00:37:25,200
THEY DON'T KNOW SHIT ABOUT

1315
00:37:25,266 --> 00:37:26,166
DUCKS, AND THEY CERTAINLY DON'T

1316
00:37:26,233 --> 00:37:29,433
KNOW SHIT ABOUT DUCK ART.

1317
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,266
AND, LOOK, I'M NOT ALONE IN

1318
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:34,200
BEING SHOCKED BY THIS.

1319
00:37:34,266 --> 00:37:37,566
THE PEOPLE WATCHING THE

1320
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:38,166
CONTEST'S LIVESTREAM WERE VERY

1321
00:37:38,233 --> 00:37:39,000
INTO THIS ENTRY, WRITING

1322
00:37:39,066 --> 00:37:39,533
"GORGEOUS.

1323
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,300
PERFECT.

1324
00:37:40,366 --> 00:37:41,100
STUNNING."

1325
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:42,333
"Y-A-A-AAAS."

1326
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,000
AND "I WANT THAT ON MY WALL."

1327
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:44,000
AND OF COURSE THEY DO.

1328
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:49,500
WHAT CULTURED DUCK ART LOVER

1329
00:37:49,566 --> 00:37:50,300
WOULD NOT WANT THAT?

1330
00:37:50,366 --> 00:37:51,100
SO AT THIS POINT, WE WERE

1331
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:51,600
GETTING A BIT NERVOUS.

1332
00:37:51,666 --> 00:37:52,333
LUCKILY, OUR FINAL PAINTING WAS

1333
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,133
GUARANTEED TO BLOW EVERYONE

1334
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,666
AWAY.

1335
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:57,200
BECAUSE IT IS THIS MASTERPIECE

1336
00:37:57,266 --> 00:37:57,833
DEPICTING A GIANT DUCK BROKERING

1337
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,009
PEACE BETWEEN LONGTIME DUCK ART

1338
00:37:59,033 --> 00:37:59,566
RIVALS TIM TAYLOR AND

1339
00:37:59,633 --> 00:38:01,166
ROB McBROOM.

1340
00:38:01,233 --> 00:38:03,466
NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND

1341
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:04,433
WOULDN'T PUT THIS THROUGH, AT

1342
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,400
LEAST TO THE SECOND ROUND.

1343
00:38:08,466 --> 00:38:09,633
RIGHT?

1344
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,466
SO JUDGES, IT'S OVER TO YOU.

1345
00:38:10,533 --> 00:38:12,933
PLEASE VOTE.

1346
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,933
IT'S OUT.

1347
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,466
FUCK YOURSELVES

1348
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:20,900
STRAIGHT TO HELL!

1349
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:23,300
I'M SORRY, THE FEDERAL DUCK

1350
00:38:23,366 --> 00:38:24,766
STAMP CONTEST JUST LOST ALL OF

1351
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:26,833
ITS INTEGRITY.

1352
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,060
ALTHOUGH, I ADMIT, THE JUDGES

1353
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,666
WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES WHO DIDN'T

1354
00:38:28,733 --> 00:38:29,066
CARE FOR IT.

1355
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:30,213
TIM TAYLOR HIMSELF ACTUALLY

1356
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:30,833
REPLIED TO THAT PAINTING IN THE

1357
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,009
CHAT WITH, "I DON'T KNOW WHY

1358
00:38:32,033 --> 00:38:33,533
ANYONE PAINTED THAT."

1359
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,200
REALLY, TIM?

1360
00:38:34,266 --> 00:38:35,300
YOU DON'T?

1361
00:38:35,366 --> 00:38:36,376
I KNOW WHY SOMEONE WOULD PAINT

1362
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,233
THAT.

1363
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,342
IT'S BECAUSE, ONE, WE PAID THEM

1364
00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:39,233
TO, AND TWO, IT'S FUCKING

1365
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,033
AWESOME.

1366
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,800
THAT'S WHY.

1367
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:44,733
SO SADLY, NONE OF OUR ENTRIES

1368
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,942
MADE IT PAST THE FIRST ROUND OF

1369
00:38:45,966 --> 00:38:46,976
VOTING, AND EVENTUALLY, THE

1370
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,433
PRIZE WENT TO THIS ENTRY:

1371
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,433
AND NOW FOR THE WINNER OF THE

1372
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,800
2022-'23 DUCK STAMP CONTEST,

1373
00:38:53,866 --> 00:38:56,433
WITH A PAINTING OF A REDHEAD,

1374
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,533
MR. JIM HAUTMAN FROM CHASKA,

1375
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,200
MINNESOTA.

1376
00:39:00,266 --> 00:39:04,333
THIS IS HIS SIXTH WIN.

1377
00:39:10,533 --> 00:39:11,266
GET THE FUCK O...

1378
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:12,066
Y'KNOW WHAT, I HAVE TO SAY:

1379
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:12,700
THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL DUCK

1380
00:39:12,766 --> 00:39:13,466
PAINTING.

1381
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:14,400
I KIND OF GET WHY THE HAUTMAN

1382
00:39:14,466 --> 00:39:14,933
BROTHERS KEEP WINNING.

1383
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,333
THAT SAID, I DO STILL PREFER OUR

1384
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:16,700
"DUCK HUNT" ONE.

1385
00:39:16,766 --> 00:39:17,266
IT'S FUNNIER AND BETTER AND

1386
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,666
WOULD HAVE BEEN A COOLER STAMP.

1387
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:21,033
BUT LOOK, I'M OBVIOUSLY

1388
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,700
DISAPPOINTED THAT WE NOT ONLY

1389
00:39:23,766 --> 00:39:25,133
DIDN'T WIN THE DUCK STAMP ART

1390
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,633
CONTEST, WE DIDN'T EVEN GET A

1391
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,566
SINGLE VOTE FROM ANY JUDGE,

1392
00:39:30,633 --> 00:39:31,913
AL THOUGH I THINK THAT SAYS MORE

1393
00:39:31,966 --> 00:39:32,500
ABOUT THEM THAN IT DOES ABOUT

1394
00:39:32,566 --> 00:39:33,000
OUR PAINTINGS.

1395
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:33,666
BECAUSE IF ANY OF OURS HAD WON,

1396
00:39:33,733 --> 00:39:34,366
THEY COULD'VE HELPED RAISE A

1397
00:39:34,433 --> 00:39:35,066
BUNCH OF MONEY FOR A VERY GOOD

1398
00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:35,900
CAUSE.

1399
00:39:35,966 --> 00:39:36,900
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS, THEY

1400
00:39:36,966 --> 00:39:39,833
ACTUALLY STILL CAN.

1401
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,933
PLEASE COME WITH ME.

1402
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:46,566
BECAUSE I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT

1403
00:39:46,633 --> 00:39:47,633
WE'VE DECIDED TO AUCTION

1404
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,533

PROCEEDS GOING TO THE FEDERAL

1407

AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

1409
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:55,509
THAT MEANS YOU... YES, YOU!

HOME.

1413
00:39:59,433 --> 00:40:01,233
YOU COULD GET RID OF YOUR STUPID

1414
00:40:04,206 --> 00:40:05,900
FAMILY PORTRAIT AND REPLACE IT

1415
00:40:05,966 --> 00:40:06,566
WITH SOMETHING MUCH, MUCH

1416
00:40:06,633 --> 00:40:07,500
