1
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:28,269
HI, THERE

2
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,081
WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL ONLY

3
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,166
TAKING PLACE HERE FOR FOUR MORE

4
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,266
SHOWS.

5
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:35,833
CAN'T COME SOON ENOUGH.

6
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,400
I THINK I LIKED IT

7
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:39,512
BETTER WHEN YOU WERE SILENT.

8
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,380
YOU KNOW WHAT WASN'T SILENT?

9
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:42,658
WHEN YOU FUCKING BLEW ME UP.

10
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,533
YOU REMEMBER THAT?
I DO.

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,000
BARCODING KIRK SCARED EVERYONE,

12
00:00:47,066 --> 00:00:51,566
AND THE HOUSE BEGAN THE

13
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:53,933
INVESTIGATION OF THE IN SPIRIT

14
00:00:57,484 --> 00:00:58,717
INSURRECTION.

15
00:00:58,742 --> 00:01:01,308
BUT WHEN JIM JORDAN STRUGGLED TO

16
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:03,133
ANSWER A BASIC QUESTION.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,766
YES OR NO, DID YOU SPEAK TO

18
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:04,766
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON JANUARY

19
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:05,100
SIXTH?

20
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:05,866
YEAH, I MEAN, I SPEAK... I

21
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:06,466
SPOKE WITH THE PRESIDENT LAST

22
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:07,566
WEEK.

23
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:08,433
I SPEAK WITH THE PRESIDENT ALL

24
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,000
THE TIME, I SPOKE WITH THE

25
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:09,533
PRESIDENT ON JANUARY 6TH.

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,133
I MEAN, I TALK WITH PRESIDENT

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,066
TRUMP ALL THE TIME.

28
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:13,266
ON JANUARY 6, DID YOU SPEAK

29
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:16,333
WITH HIM BEFORE, DURING, OR

30
00:01:20,335 --> 00:01:22,841
AFTER THE CAPITOL WAS ATTACKED?

31
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:25,600
UH, I'D HAVE TO GO... I

32
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:26,566
I SPOKE WITH HIM THAT

33
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:27,333
DAY AFTER?

34
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,566
I THINK AFTER?

35
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:29,300
I DON'T KNOW IF I SPOKE WITH HIM

36
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:29,800
IN THE MORNING OR NOT.

37
00:01:29,866 --> 00:01:30,566
I JUST DON'T KNOW.

38
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:31,833
I'D HAVE TO GO BACK AND... I

39
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,600
MEAN, I DON'T, I DON'T, I DON'T

40
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,500
KNOW WHEN THOSE CONVERSATIONS

41
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:36,166
HAPPENED, BUT WHAT I KNOW IS, I

42
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:39,200
SPOKE WITH HIM ALL THE TIME.

43
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:39,966
OH, OKAY THEN!

44
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:40,666
THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE!

45
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:41,666
YOU SEEM TO BE EMPLOYING BOTH

46
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:42,400
THE NERVOUS ENERGY AND DEEPLY

47
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:43,200
SUSPICIOUS DENIALS NORMALLY

48
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:51,266
RESERVED FOR WOODY ALLEN.

49
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,200
WHY WOULDN'T I FIND THAT

50
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:53,133
REASSURING?

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,000
BUT INSTEAD OF THAT, I'D LIKE TO

52
00:01:54,066 --> 00:01:54,833
BRIEFLY FOCUS ON AFGHANISTAN.

53
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,500
THE U.S. WITHDRAWAL FROM THERE

54
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:56,233
IS NEARLY COMPLETE, AHEAD OF THE

55
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,000
AUGUST 31 DEADLINE SET BY THE

56
00:01:57,066 --> 00:01:58,000
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION.

57
00:01:58,066 --> 00:01:59,109
BUT MANY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

58
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:00,600
WHO'S BEING LEFT BEHIND.

59
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,466
AS AMERICA ENDS ITS LONGEST

60
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:03,642
WAR, THE TRANSLATORS LEFT BEHIND

61
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:04,966
ARE BEGGING THE BIDEN

62
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:06,766
ADMINISTRATION TO CUT THROUGH

63
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,500
THE RED TAPE AND GRANT THEM

64
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:13,000
SPECIAL VISAS TO COME TO THE

65
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,100
U.S.

66
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,233
TODAY, INDEPENDENT SENATOR

67
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,833
ANGUS KING TOLD REPORTERS THE

68
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,600
PRESIDENT'S HAIR SHOULD BE ON

69
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:17,700
FIRE OVER THIS SITUATION.

70
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:19,000
IT'S TRUE.

71
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:20,309
THIS IS A SITUATION BIDEN'S HAIR

72
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,200
SHOULD BE ON FIRE ABOUT... BOTH

73
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:21,966
METAPHORICALLY AND LITERALLY.

74
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:23,333
IT'D FRANKLY BE A HUGE

75
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,333
IMPROVEMENT ON HIS CURRENT LOOK,

76
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,400
WHICH I'D DESCRIBE AS

77
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:33,500
"BUSINESS GHOST," ALSO KNOWN AS

78
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:35,400
THE "SANE DOC BROWN" OR

79
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:35,966
"THE FLAT JAMIE LEE CURTIS."

80
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:36,600
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, THERE ARE

81
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:37,233
THOUSANDS OF AFGHANS WHO HELPED

82
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:37,833
U.S. TROOPS DURING THE WAR WHO

83
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,800
BADLY NEED TO BE EVACUATED

84
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:39,533
BECAUSE THE TALIBAN VERY MUCH

85
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
WANTS TO KILL THEM.

86
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:42,633
SINCE 2014, MORE THAN 300

87
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,780
TRANSLATORS OR THEIR FAMILY

88
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,500
MEMBERS HAVE BEEN KILLED.

89
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,233
AND I WILL SAY, PUBLICLY, BIDEN

90
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,866
HAS BEEN SENDING ENCOURAGING

91
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:52,466
MESSAGES.

92
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:53,576
OUR MESSAGE TO THOSE WOMEN

93
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,666
AND MEN IS CLEAR.

94
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:57,166
THERE IS A HOME FOR YOU IN THE

95
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:58,833
UNITED STATES IF YOU SO CHOOSE,

96
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,700
AND WE WILL STAND WITH YOU JUST

97
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:05,800
AS YOU STOOD WITH US.

98
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:06,533
OH, WELL, THAT SOUNDS

99
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,100
GREAT!

100
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:10,933
ALTHOUGH THAT "IF THEY SO CHOOSE

101
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,076
PART" IS DOING A LOT OF WORK.

102
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,800
BECAUSE IT'S NOT SO MUCH THEIR

103
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:13,400
CHOICE AS OURS.

104
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:14,133
WE'RE THE ONES IN CHARGE OF THE

105
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,833
PROCESS, SO PUTTING THE CHOICE

106
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,600
ON THE APPLICANTS IS BASICALLY A

107
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,200
SURGEON HANDING YOU A SCALPEL,

108
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,500
SAYING, "THERE IS A TUMOR-FREE

109
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:21,776
PANCREAS IN YOUR BODY IF YOU SO

110
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,733
CHOOSE, AND I WILL STAND WITH

111
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,866
YOU."

112
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:26,700
I THINK YOU MIGHT BE

113
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:27,566
FUNDAMENTALLY CONFUSED ABOUT WHO

114
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:29,833
HAS POWER OVER THE OUTCOME HERE.

115
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,009
AND THE APPLICATION PROCESS HAS

116
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:32,833
BEEN A MESS FOR A LONG TIME.

117
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,733
AS WE DISCUSSED ON THE FIRST

118
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,300
SEASON OF THIS SHOW...

119
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:39,266
PRESUMABLY 40 YEARS AGO... JUST

120
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,666
APPLYING FOR A SPECIAL IMMIGRANT

121
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:42,700
VISA CAN BE A NIGHTMARE.

122
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:44,500
AND WHILE 18,000 AFGHANS HAVE

123
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:46,133
APPLIED ON BEHALF OF THEMSELVES

124
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,166
AND THEIR FAMILIES...

125
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:49,933
REPRESENTING AN ESTIMATED 53,000

126
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,433
PEOPLE IN TOTAL... MANY HAVE

127
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,866
BEEN STUCK WAITING, IN SOME

128
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,466
CASES FOR YEARS.

129
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:58,000
MONEER NOORI HAS BEEN WAITING

130
00:03:58,066 --> 00:03:59,076
ON A SPECIAL IMMIGRANT VISA FOR

131
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,000
NEARLY A DECADE.

132
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:03,233
HE FIRST APPLIED FOR A

133
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,766
SPECIAL IMMIGRANT VISA IN 2013

134
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:05,666
AND SAID HE'S BEEN REJECTED FOUR

135
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:06,433
TIMES.

136
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,700
MONEER WAS TOLD BY THE STATE

137
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:08,366
DEPARTMENT THAT HIS DOCUMENTS

138
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:09,133
WERE FRAUDULENT BUT WAS NOT

139
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,033
GIVEN ANY SPECIFIC EXAMPLE TO

140
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,766
APPEAL.

141
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:12,733
THERE IS MORE THAN HUNDREDS

142
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,400
AND HUNDREDS MORE SPECIAL FORCE

143
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:17,866
INTERPRETERS LEFT BEHIND.

144
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:20,500
THEY HAVE THE SAME ISSUES.

145
00:04:20,566 --> 00:04:21,466
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT

146
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:23,200
BEHIND.

147
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:25,833
YEAH, OF COURSE NOT.

148
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,266
AND WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

149
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,533
BECAUSE IT'S PRACTICALLY A

150
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,866
DEATH SENTENCE.

151
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:32,133
BEING LEFT BEHIND, IN THIS

152
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,633
CONTEXT IS EVEN WORSE THAN

153
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,000
SEEING "LEFT BEHIND," THE 2014

154
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,566
NICOLAS CAGE FAITH-BASED

155
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:38,166
THRILLER ABOUT THE SECOND COMING

156
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:41,500
THAT BOASTS... AND THIS IS

157
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:44,233
TRUE... A SOLID 1%

158
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:44,666
ON ROTTEN TOMATOES.

159
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:46,366
CLEARLY, THERE AREN'T MANY

160
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:48,000
THINGS WORSE THAN SEEING

161
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:49,109
"LEFT BEHIND," BUT I'M GOING TO

162
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:50,300
SAY GETTING ABANDONED TO BE

163
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:51,500
MURDERED BY THE TALIBAN IS

164
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:52,000
DEFINITELY ONE OF THEM.

165
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:52,900
AND IT'S NOT JUST THAT

166
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:54,600
INTERPRETER WHO'S FRUSTRATED...

167
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,066
THE U.S. SOLDIERS HE WORKED

168
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:57,533
ALONGSIDE ARE ALSO APPALLED BY

169
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,400
THE SITUATION.

170
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,200
WE'RE FILLING OUT ALL THE

171
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:01,733
PAPERWORK.

172
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,566
WE'RE GOING THROUGH ALL THE DUE

173
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:03,300
DILIGENCE AND THE PROCESS TO

174
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:04,533
MAKE THIS RIGHT.

175
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,966
AND NOBODY IS RESPONDING WITH

176
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:07,266
ANY INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE

177
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:11,666
CRITICAL TO GETTING HIM OUT OF

178
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:12,300
COUNTRY.

179
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:13,200
LIKE, THIS IS, LIKE,

180
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:13,800
BOTH A HUGE LEADERSHIP FAILURE

181
00:05:13,866 --> 00:05:14,976
FOR ME, LIKE, PERSONALLY, AND

182
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,466
THE MILITARY.

183
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:16,466
THE... THE FACT THAT I HAVEN'T

184
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:17,200
BEEN ABLE TO GET MY... MY GUY

185
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:18,833
OUT.

186
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,700
THAT DOES SOUND

187
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:22,633
MADDENING.

188
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,566
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE "GETTING MY

189
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:26,000
GUY OUT" IS BASICALLY WHAT WE'VE

190
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:26,800
BEEN CONDITIONED TO THINK THE

191
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:27,800
MILITARY DOES.

192
00:05:27,866 --> 00:05:28,942
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE "SAVING

193
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:30,300
PRIVATE RYAN, " NOT " FILING

194
00:05:30,366 --> 00:05:31,700
PAPERWORK ON PRIVATE RYAN'S

195
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:33,400
BEHALF, WAITING A FEW MONTHS,

196
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,900
FILING REQUISITION PAPERWORK TO

197
00:05:34,966 --> 00:05:35,833
TRACK DOWN THE INITIAL

198
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,733
PAPERWORK, AND THEN LEARNING

199
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,233
PRIVATE RYAN WAS SHOT IN THE

200
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,466
HEAD BY A NAZI LAST MONTH."

201
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,666
AND THERE IS REAL URGENCY HERE,

202
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:43,833
AS THE TALIBAN CURRENTLY

203
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,500
CONTROLS ABOUT HALF OF

204
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:46,100
AFGHANISTAN'S 419 DISTRICT

205
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,633
CENTERS, AND WHILE THEY'VE YET

206
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,433
TO CAPTURE ANY OF THE PROVINCIAL

207
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,660
CAPITALS, THEY ARE PRESSURING

208
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,733
ABOUT HALF OF THEM.

209
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,766
THIS IS BASICALLY THE BILL COSBY

210
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:54,873
COMEBACK TOUR OF POLITICAL

211
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,700
WE CAN ALL SEE WHERE

212
00:05:56,766 --> 00:05:58,033
IT'S GOING, AND IF WE DON'T ACT

213
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,766
QUICKLY, SOMETHING TERRIBLE IS

214
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,266
GOING TO HAPPEN.

215
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,166
AND INCREDIBLY, THERE ARE

216
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:09,266
SOME... LIKE SUPERCUTS SUPERFAN

217
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,409
RAND PAUL... WHO HAVE QUESTIONED

218
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:11,642
WHETHER WE SHOULD BE EVACUATING

219
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:12,133
ALL THESE PEOPLE AT ALL.

220
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,766
I WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM RATHER

221
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,066
TO STAY AND FIGHT.

222
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:17,066
I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE

223
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:17,966
MANY ENGLISH SPEAKERS IN

224
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:18,833
AFGHANISTAN.

225
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,942
THE FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN COULD

226
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:21,400
BE A BRIGHT FUTURE, BUT THEY'RE

227
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:23,100
GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT

228
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,276
AND, ULTIMATELY, IT IS THEIR

229
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:24,733
FIGHT.

230
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,666
OKAY, FIRST... FUCK ALL

231
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:28,533
THE WAY OFF.

232
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,500
AND SECOND... FIGHT WITH FUCKING

233
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:30,200
WHAT, EXACTLY?

234
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:31,133
THEIR WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF THE

235
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,566
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THERE, THEIR

236
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:33,200
AND THEY'RE?

237
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:34,433
ALSO, TELLING TRANSLATORS TO

238
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,466
"STAY AND FIGHT THE TALIBAN" IS

239
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:37,900
PRETTY RICH COMING FROM A GUY

240
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:39,042
WHO COULDN'T EVEN WIN A FIGHT

241
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,433
AGAINST HIS NEIGHBOR ON HIS OWN

242
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,433
FRONT LAWN.

243
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,000
AND THE ADMINISTRATION MAY POINT

244
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:46,333
TO THE FACT THAT, THIS MONTH,

245
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:46,966
2500 AFGHANS ARE BEING FLOWN IN

246
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:47,500
STAGES TO AN ARMY BASE IN

247
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:48,700
VIRGINIA.

248
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:50,400
AND THAT THEY'RE NEGOTIATING

249
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:51,509
WITH THIRD COUNTRIES LIKE QATAR

250
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:52,576
AND KUWAIT TO HOUSE AFGHANS AT

251
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,000
MILITARY BASES WHILE THEY AWAIT

252
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:56,133
VISA APPROVAL.

253
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,566
BUT SO FAR A TINY PERCENTAGE OF

254
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:59,133
THE PEOPLEIN THE PIPELINE HAVE

255
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,233
BEEN EVACUATED.

256
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,166
AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE JUST

257
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:07,466
SCRAMBLING FOR A PLAN NOW IS

258
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:09,500
INEXCUSABLE WHEN WE'VE HAD 20

259
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:10,709
YEARS TO DEVELOP ONE, AND FOR

260
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:11,876
AROUND HALF THAT TIME, BIDEN WAS

261
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,933
IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

262
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,200
IF WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE

263
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:18,666
THESE APPLICANTS ARE SAFE, WE

264
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:20,333
COULD BRING THEM TO THE U.S. FOR

265
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:20,633
PROCESSING.

266
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,833
GUAM HAS BEEN SUGGESTED.

267
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,109
AND WE SHOULD DO THAT RIGHT NOW

268
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:24,533
BECAUSE THE CLOCK IS TICKING,

269
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,466
AND THE TRANSLATORS IN

270
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:26,100
AFGHANISTAN ARE WELL AWARE OF

271
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,600
THAT FACT.

272
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:28,933
WHILE EVACUATION PLANS TO A

273
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,400
THIRD COUNTRY MAY STILL BE

274
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:32,166
UNCERTAIN, THE TALIBAN DEATH

275
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:34,566
THREATS HERE ARE CRYSTAL CLEAR.

276
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:36,033
YEAH, I RECEIVE A LOT OF

277
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,133
PHONE CALLS FROM THEM.

278
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,033
PHONE CALLS?

279
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,266
YES.

280
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,000
AND THEY TOLD ME, "SOON WE WILL

281
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:43,000
COME TO KABUL, AND WE WILL FIND

282
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:44,766
YOU AND WE WILL KILL YOU."

283
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,166
THE TALIBAN HAVE SAID

284
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,966
INTERPRETERS WILL NOT BE IN

285
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:50,400
DANGER, AS LONG AS THEY SHOW

286
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:51,400
REMORSE FOR THEIR TREASON.

287
00:07:51,466 --> 00:07:53,466
WOULD ANYONE BELIEVE THAT?

288
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:54,100
YOU'RE ALMOST LAUGHING, YOU

289
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,900
WOULDN'T BELIEVE THEM.

290
00:07:55,966 --> 00:07:56,800
NO, I WILL NEVER BELIEVE

291
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:57,466
THEM.

292
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:59,400
YEAH, OF COURSE HE

293
00:07:59,466 --> 00:08:01,533
DOESN'T BELIEVE THE TALIBAN.

294
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,366
A "TALIBAN PROMISE" SOUNDS

295
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:04,566
INHERENTLY LIKE BULLSHIT.

296
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:05,800
IT ALSO SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY

297
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:06,633
RACIST SOFT-CORE ROMANCE

298
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,366
PAPERBACK WRITTEN BY A WHITE

299
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:08,333
WOMAN WHO'S NEVER MET ANYONE

300
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,333
FROM THERE.

301
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,666
BUT MOSTLY IT SOUNDS LIKE

302
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:11,600
BULLSHIT.

303
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,066
THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE

304
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:14,833
THINGS WILL END WELL FOR ANYONE

305
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,566
WE LEAVE BEHIND.

306
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:18,600
THESE PEOPLE HELPED US AT GREAT

307
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,933
RISK TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR

308
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,233
FAMILIES.

309
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,000
AND IF YOU DON'T THINK WE SHOULD

310
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:25,800
GIVE THEM A SAFE HOME HERE IN

311
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:32,066
RETURN, THEN ALL I HAVE TO SAY

312
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:34,433
ACTUALLY, CAN I GET A TRANSLATOR

313
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,600
FOR THAT?

314
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:36,933
HE SAID, "FUCK YOU."

315
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,400
I DID.

316
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:38,466
THANK YOU.

317
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:42,133
AND NOW THIS.

318
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,766
AND NOW, AND

319
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,766
NOW, JIM CRAMER LOVES CHIPOTLE.

320
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:47,600
THE WORST RESTAURANTS ARE

321
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,866
GOING UP AND NOT THE BEST ONES.

322
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:51,033
BUT CHIPOTLE IS THE BEST.

323
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,033
I LOVE THEM.

324
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,466
I WOULD EAT CHIPOTLE ALL THE

325
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:55,933
WAY.

326
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,266
THEY ARE BACK AND THEY SEEM TO

327
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,533
LOVE CHIPOTLE AS I DO.

328
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,966
I STILL LOVE CHIPOTLE IT WAS

329
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:03,466
AWESOME.

330
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:06,833
I HAD A BURRITO.

331
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,400
OH, BOY, WHEN IT COMES TO

332
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:09,566
CHIPOTLE.

333
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:14,166
TO BE FAIR, NO ONE LOOKS GOOD...

334
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:14,800
EVERYONE GOES TO CHIPOTLE.

335
00:09:14,866 --> 00:09:18,233
CHIPOTLE LAST WEEK.

336
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,533
I HAD CHIPOTLE YESTERDAY.

337
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,166
WHY?

338
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:22,333
YOU WERE ABLE TO SIT DOWN AND

339
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,933
HAVE YOUR CILANTRO LIME

340
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,466
ROASTED... IT IS UNBELIEVABLY

341
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,233
GOOD.

342
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,400
HAVE YOU EVER HAD CHIPOTLE?

343
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:31,466
YEAH, I HAVE.

344
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,933
I HAVE HAD IT.

345
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,700
YEAH.

346
00:09:35,766 --> 00:09:39,433
HE ENJOYS IT A GREAT DEAL.

347
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,266
IT'S GOT CHEESE.

348
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:44,533
A LOT OF CHEESE, RIGHT?

349
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,400
IS THAT WHAT QUESO IS?

350
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:48,133
HAVE YOU EVER HAD A BOWL?

351
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,433
I HAD A BALL.

352
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,000
I'VE HAD A BURRITO?

353
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:54,466
YOU GET THE BOX?

354
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:58,066
I DON'T GO THERE THAT OFTEN.

355
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:02,700
MOVING ON.

356
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:03,500
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

357
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:03,966
AMBULANCES.

358
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:04,566
Y'KNOW, BIG OUCHIE TRUCKS THAT

359
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:05,866
GO WOOP-WOOP.

360
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:06,976
AMBULANCES CAN BE AN ANNOYANCE

361
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,700
TO CITY DWELLERS WITH THEIR

362
00:10:07,766 --> 00:10:08,766
SHRIEKING SIRENS.

363
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,700
ALTHOUGH, NOT IF YOU LIVE IN

364
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:12,466
BRUSSELS, WHERE THAT SIREN

365
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:18,359
SOUNDS VERY DIFFERENT.

366
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:27,308
OKAY, THAT'S JUST AN OBJECTIVELY

367
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,974
BETTER SIREN.

368
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:31,501
IT SOUNDS LIKE MICKEY MOUSE
GETTING FUCKED ON A

369
00:10:31,526 --> 00:10:34,569
WASHING MACHINE... IN A GOOD
WAY.

370
00:10:34,594 --> 00:10:36,394
AND I KNOW THAT'S HARD TO
PICTURE, SO LET ME HELP:

371
00:10:41,122 --> 00:10:42,256
OH, BOY.

372
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,233
I MEAN, THAT'S

373
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:43,766
FANTASTIC.

374
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:44,366
I'D FAR RATHER BE WOKEN UP BY

375
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:44,933
THE SOUNDS OF AMERICA'S RAT

376
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,466
GETTING RAILED ON THE SPIN

377
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:46,066
CYCLE, BECAUSE I'D IMMEDIATELY

378
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:46,600
LAUGH, THEN REMEMBER THAT

379
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,200
SOMEONE WAS HAVING A MEDICAL

380
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:47,800
EMERGENCY AND FEEL BAD, THEN

381
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:48,433
HEAR THE SIREN AND LAUGH MYSELF

382
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:48,800
TO SLEEP AGAIN.

383
00:10:48,866 --> 00:10:50,300
WHAT A SIREN!

384
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:50,933
ANYWAY, AMBULANCE CREWS CLEARLY

385
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,933
PLAY A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ROLE

386
00:10:57,566 --> 00:10:58,785
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

387
00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:59,819
SO IT'S NO WONDER THAT DURING

388
00:10:59,844 --> 00:11:00,511
THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC LAST

389
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:01,645
YEAR, THEY WERE AMONG THOSE WHO

390
00:11:01,716 --> 00:11:03,883
GOT AN OUTPOURING OF GRATITUDE

391
00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:05,308
AND NIGHTLY APPLAUSE, WITH NEW

392
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,900
YORK'S MAYOR EVEN MAKING THIS

393
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,733
I WANT TO GUARANTEE YOU ONE

394
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,400
THAT WHEN THAT DAY COMES

395
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:16,433
THAT WE CAN RESTART THE

396
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,800
BEAUTIFUL, VIBRANT LIFE OF THIS

397
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:20,100
CITY AGAIN, THE FIRST THING WE

398
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,333
WILL DO IS WE WILL HAVE A

399
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,100
TICKER-TAPE PARADE DOWN THE

400
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:24,833
CANYON OF HEROES FOR OUR HEALTH

401
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,200
CARE WORKERS AND OUR FIRST

402
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:27,366
RESPONDERS.

403
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:29,800
WE WILL HONOR THOSE WHO SAVED

404
00:11:29,866 --> 00:11:31,300
US.

405
00:11:31,366 --> 00:11:32,633
I DON'T

406
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,000
KNOW IF A PARADE IS QUITE THE

407
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:35,866
DANGLING CARROT DE BLASIO SEEMS

408
00:11:35,933 --> 00:11:36,366
TO THINK IT IS.

409
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:37,609
BECAUSE PARADES... AND THIS IS

410
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:39,933
TRUE... SUCK.

411
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,333
THEY'RE LOUD, CROWDED, AND GO ON

412
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,476
APPROXIMATELY FOUR HOURS TOO

413
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,566
LONG.

414
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:45,033
THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THE

415
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,233
THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE IS

416
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,509
SEEING WHICH COUNTRY SINGER GETS

417
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:48,266
TO LIP SYNC NEXT TO THE JOLLY

418
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,066
GREEN GIANT'S DICK.

419
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:51,300
BUT SECOND, THERE WAS A SMALL

420
00:11:51,366 --> 00:11:52,766
IRONY IN ALL THE VOCAL

421
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,366
APPRECIATION THAT TOOK PLACE

422
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:55,900
LAST YEAR, AS THIS EMT WE

423
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,733
FEATURED POINTED OUT.

424
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,100
RIGHT NOW, I'M DOING ALL OF

425
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,566
THIS WITH NO HEALTH INSURANCE.

426
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:03,100
THE JOB DOESN'T OFFER IT.

427
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,600
AND OUR AFFORDABLE MARKETPLACES

428
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,633
AREN'T VERY AFFORDABLE.

429
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,733
IF I GET SICK AND, OKAY, I GO

430
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,166
GET TESTED POSITIVE, I CAN'T GO

431
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,000
TO THE HOSPITAL.

432
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:17,306
AND, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE COME OUT,

433
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,133
AND THEY SHOW US THEIR SUPPORT.

434
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,766
AND I LOVE IT.

435
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:21,942
I LOVE... I HAVE EATEN SO MUCH

436
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:23,009
PIZZA IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS.

437
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,166
IT'S BEEN GREAT.

438
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:25,166
I DON'T NEED PIZZA.

439
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:25,933
I NEED TO BE ABLE TO PAY MY

440
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,933
BILLS.

441
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,600
RIGHT.

442
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:29,876
PEOPLE CLAPPING AND GIVING PIZZA

443
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,566
IN APPRECIATION WAS VERY NICE

444
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:34,400
BUT WASN'T A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE

445
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:36,600
THINGS THEY ACTUALLY NEEDED,

446
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:37,500
LIKE A LIVING WAGE AND HEALTH

447
00:12:37,566 --> 00:12:38,266
BENEFITS.

448
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,833
IF YOU

449
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,100
HAD A HEART ATTACK AND

450
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:41,666
PARAMEDICS SHOWED UP WITH A

451
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:48,900
PEPPERONI PIE AND SOME GARLIC

452
00:12:48,966 --> 00:12:49,533
KNOTS, YOU'D GRATEFUL, SURE,

453
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,233
BUT YOU'D BE ALSO JUSTIFIED IN

454
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,200
POINTING OUT THAT'S NOT

455
00:12:51,266 --> 00:12:51,800
EVERYTHING THAT THE SITUATION

456
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:52,066
DEMANDED.

457
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:52,800
AND THAT MAN'S STORY IS BY NO

458
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:53,733
MEANS A ONE-OFF.

459
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,033
EMS WORKERS AROUND THE COUNTRY

460
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,242
ARE SHOCKINGLY UNDERPAID, WHICH

461
00:12:56,266 --> 00:12:57,966
IS KIND OF AMAZING, ESPECIALLY

462
00:12:58,033 --> 00:13:00,000
WHEN YOU CONSIDER HOW

463
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:02,500
PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE TAKING

464
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:03,833
AN AMBULANCE CAN BE... SO MUCH

465
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,300
SO THAT YOU'LL OFTEN SEE LOCAL

466
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:06,900
NEWS STORIES LIKE THIS:

467
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:08,600
IT WAS RUSH HOUR AT THE MASS

468
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:09,100
AVENUE STATION WHEN THIS

469
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,500
PASSENGER STEPPED OFF THE

470
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:12,633
CROWDED TRAIN.

471
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,133
SURVEILLANCE VIDEO SHOWS THE

472
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,700
MOMENT HER LEG DROPPED INTO THE

473
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:17,366
GAP, TRAPPING HER BETWEEN THE

474
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:19,033
TRAIN AND THE PLATFORM.

475
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,033
AS OTHER COMMUTERS ROCKED THE

476
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,000
TRAIN TO DISLODGE THE WOMAN'S

477
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:27,866
LEG, A BOSTON GLOBE REPORTER

478
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,033
TWEETED FROM THE SCENE, "SHE

479
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,933
BEGGED 'NO ONE CALL AN

480
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,866
AMBULANCE.

481
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:33,466
IT'S $3,000.

482
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:34,233
I CAN'T AFFORD THAT.'"

483
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,033
WOW.

484
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,500
IT'S A PRETTY STRONG INDICTMENT

485
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:37,133
OF OUR CURRENT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

486
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,733
THAT THAT WOMAN'S MAIN CONCERN

487
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,366
WAS GETTING CRUSHED FINANCIALLY,

488
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:40,733
EVEN WHILE SHE WAS GETTING

489
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,533
CRUSHED PHYSICALLY.

490
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,566
SO GIVEN THAT WE HAVE INJURED

491
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:46,366
PEOPLE BEGGING BYSTANDERS NOT TO

492
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:48,333
CALL AMBULANCES AND THE EMTs

493
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,733
WHO WORK INSIDE THEM FORCED TO

494
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,233
LIVE OFF PIZZA DONATIONS,

495
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,733
TONIGHT, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT

496
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,876
OUR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES:

497
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,233
SPECIFICALLY, HOW THEY FUNCTION,

498
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,900
WHY THEY CAN BE SO EXPENSIVE,

499
00:13:57,966 --> 00:13:59,566
AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO FIX

500
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:01,533
THINGS.

501
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,333
AND THE FIRST THING TO KNOW IS,

502
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,700
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO

503
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:06,200
CONSISTENCY WHEN IT COMES TO EMS

504
00:14:06,266 --> 00:14:07,566
IN THIS COUNTRY.

505
00:14:07,633 --> 00:14:09,000
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT "EMERGENCY

506
00:14:09,066 --> 00:14:10,366
MEDICAL SERVICES," YOU'RE

507
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,800
ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT 19,000

508
00:14:12,866 --> 00:14:13,909
LOCALLY RUN EMS PROVIDERS WITH

509
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:16,700
WILDLY DIFFERENT STRUCTURES.

510
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:18,366
TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF JUST HOW

511
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:20,100
IN

512
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,300
HOUSTON, EMS IS PROVIDED BY

513
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:22,800
FIREFIGHTERS CROSS-TRAINED AS

514
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:24,633
PARAMEDICS OR EMTs.

515
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,033
IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S UNDER THE

516
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,733
FIRE DEPARTMENT UMBRELLA, BUT

517
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,100
IT'S A SEPARATE DIVISION AND

518
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,766
SUPPLEMENTED BY PRIVATE

519
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,200
COMPANIES.

520
00:14:32,266 --> 00:14:33,133
IN PITTSBURGH, IT'S A

521
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,100
FREE-STANDING MUNICIPAL

522
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,433
DEPARTMENT OF ITS OWN.

523
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,633
AND IN RURAL WYOMING, EMS IS

524
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,400
MOSTLY PROVIDED BY

525
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:39,633
VOLUNTEER-BASED ORGANIZATIONS.

526
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,033
AND FRUSTRATINGLY, IN NO PARTS

527
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,900
OF THE COUNTRY DOES EMS HAVE

528
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:48,246
AMBULANCES THAT SOUND LIKE THIS:

529
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:51,200
THE VERY FACT OUR SIRENS COULD

530
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,600
SOUND LIKE A PUCCINI ARIA

531
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,166
PERFORMED BY A FLUSTERED

532
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:56,833
PARAKEET, AND YET, WE CHOOSE FOR

533
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,500
THAT NOT TO BE THE CASE, MAKES

534
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:02,726
US A BUNCH OF FUCKING IDIOTS.

535
00:15:02,766 --> 00:15:03,266
BUT ALL OF THIS IS TO SAY:

536
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,493
IF YOU'VE SEEN ONE EMS SETUP,

537
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:05,033
YOU'VE SEEN EXACTLY ONE EMS

538
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,166
SETUP.

539
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:09,566
AND ONE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT

540
00:15:09,633 --> 00:15:11,333
THERE IS NO SINGLE FEDERAL

541
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,233
AGENCY OVERSEEING AND SUPPORTING

542
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,033
EMS IN THE SAME THE WAY THAT,

543
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,466
FOR INSTANCE, FIRE DEPARTMENTS

544
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:16,466
HAVE THE U.S. FIRE

545
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:18,933
ADMINISTRATION.

546
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,176
AND THE FRUSTRATING THING IS, IT

547
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,400
DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY.

548
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:23,333
BACK IN 1973, CONGRESS ENACTED

549
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,566
THE EMS SYSTEMS ACT, WHICH

550
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,666
CREATED A NEW PROGRAM TO HELP

551
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:27,366
DEVELOP REGIONAL EMS SYSTEMS,

552
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:29,200
SOMETHING THAT WAS BADLY NEEDED.

553
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:30,466
PRIOR TO THAT, AMBULANCE

554
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:31,733
SERVICES WERE FREQUENTLY

555
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,566
PROVIDED BY HEARSES, SIMPLY

556
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:34,842
BECAUSE THEY WERE LONG ENOUGH TO

557
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:36,233
TRANSPORT A HUMAN BODY.

558
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,233
UNFORTUNATELY, UNDER THE REAGAN

559
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,733
ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET CUTS

560
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,400
ELIMINATED DIRECT FEDERAL

561
00:15:43,466 --> 00:15:44,933
FUNDING AND OVERSIGHT, SHIFTING

562
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,100
THE RESPONSIBILITY ONTO THE

563
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:47,966
STATES... MANY OF WHICH OPTED TO

564
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:50,566
DIRECT THEIR MONEY AWAY FROM EMS

565
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:51,933
AND INTO OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH

566
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,033
SERVICES INSTEAD.

567
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,566
WHICH BRINGS US TO AN INCREDIBLE

568
00:15:55,633 --> 00:15:57,700
UNLIKE OTHER FIRST

569
00:15:57,766 --> 00:15:59,200
RESPONDERS, SUCH AS POLICE AND

570
00:15:59,266 --> 00:16:04,433
FIRE DEPARTMENTS, RIGHT NOW, IN

571
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,576
ALL 39 OF THESE STATES, EMS IS

572
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,733
NOT CONSIDERED AN ESSENTIAL

573
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
SERVICE, MEANING LOCAL

574
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,133
GOVERNMENTS DON'T HAVE TO

575
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,066
PROVIDE IT TO THEIR CITIZENS.

576
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:12,666
WHICH, AS A PRACTICAL MATTER,

577
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:13,966
MEANS EMS GENERALLY HAS LESS

578
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:17,033
ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT FUNDING.

579
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,666
THIS IS A HUGE DEAL.

580
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:20,200
AND IF THIS IS SURPRISING NEWS

581
00:16:20,266 --> 00:16:21,266
TO YOU, YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

582
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,766
JUST LISTEN TO THIS UTAH STATE

583
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,600
REPRESENTATIVE.

584
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,566
I BECAME AWARE OF THE FACT

585
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:29,900
THAT THIS ISSUE EXISTED WHEN I

586
00:16:29,966 --> 00:16:31,633
ASKED THE QUESTION TO CHIEF BRAD

587
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,300
HANNIG, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

588
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:40,766
HE STARTED EXPLAINING TO ME THIS

589
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,533
ISSUE AND I WAS LIKE, REALLY?

590
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,166
'CAUSE I THOUGHT THIS WAS AN

591
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:45,166
ESSENTIAL SERVICE TOO.

592
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:46,066
I DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER.

593
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:46,966
YEAH, OF COURSE HE WAS

594
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:48,433
SURPRISED!

595
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,200
FINDING OUT THAT EMS IS NOT

596
00:16:50,266 --> 00:16:51,476
DEEMED ESSENTIAL IS LIKE FINDING

597
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,700
OUT THAT MOST STATES DON'T

598
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:54,766
CONSIDER GEESE TO BE BIRDS.

599
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,066
THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE.

600
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:57,300
THEY HAVE BEAKS, WINGS,

601
00:16:57,366 --> 00:16:59,266
FEATHERS, THEY RAIN SHIT FROM

602
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,100
THE SKY, SULLY SULLENBERGER IS

603
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,566
THEIR JEFFREY DAHMER...

604
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:03,633
THEY'RE FUCKING BIRDS!

605
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,776
I DIDN'T REALIZE ANYONE WAS EVEN

606
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,433
DISPUTING THAT.

607
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,300
EMS PROVIDERS CAN BE SO STRAPPED

608
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:10,606
FOR CASH... ESPECIALLY IN RURAL

609
00:17:10,633 --> 00:17:11,466
AREAS... THAT THEY HAVE TO

610
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:12,533
FUNDRAISE FOR THEMSELVES.

611
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,033
DO A QUICK SEARCH ON GOFUNDME

612
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,200
RIGHT NOW, AND YOU'LL FIND

613
00:17:17,266 --> 00:17:18,033
MULTIPLE OUTFITS TRYING TO RAISE

614
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,566
MONEY FOR EQUIPMENT, GEAR, AND

615
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:23,233
UPDATED AMBULANCES.

616
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,400
AND YOU KNOW OUR HEALTHCARE

617
00:17:26,466 --> 00:17:27,700
SYSTEM IS FUCKED UP WHEN

618
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:28,966
PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS ARE

619
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:30,109
RELYING ON THE SAME CROWDFUNDING

620
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:30,566
PLATFORM.

621
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,966
SOME PEOPLE EVEN DO FUNDRAISING

622
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:32,900
STUNTS FOR THEIR LOCAL EMS,

623
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:35,266
WHETHER IT'S THIS GUY DOING A

624
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:35,900
POLAR BEAR PLUNGE FOR A THOUSAND

625
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:36,833
BUCKS OR THIS DJ DOING A

626
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,500
THREE-HOUR LIVESTREAM THAT

627
00:17:38,566 --> 00:17:39,133
RAISED MONEY FOR EMS WORKERS IN

628
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,466
NEW YORK.

629
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:42,233
AND I HAVE TO SAY... MY

630
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,033
ADMIRATION FOR THAT MAN'S

631
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,933
GENEROSITY IS ALMOST ENOUGH TO

632
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,142
OVERCOME MY HORROR AT THE IDEA

633
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,866
OF A THREE-HOUR LIVESTREAM DJ

634
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,766
SET.

635
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:50,909
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE DONATING A

636
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:52,066
MILLION DOLLARS TO CANCER

637
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:53,533
RESEARCH BY WRITING OUT A CHECK

638
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,266
IN TURTLE BLOOD.

639
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:58,500
LOVE THE END, HATE THE MEANS.

640
00:17:58,566 --> 00:18:00,433
AND THESE MASSIVE FUNDING

641
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,733
DEFICIENCIES START TO EXPLAIN

642
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,666
WHY IT IS THAT EMS WORKERS LIKE

643
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:05,166
THAT GUY YOU SAW EARLIER ARE SO

644
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:06,866
TERRIBLY PAID.

645
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:09,566
THE MEDIAN ANNUAL WAGE IS JUST

646
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:11,633
OVER $36,000... WELL BELOW WHAT

647
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,266
POLICE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS

648
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,133
MAKE... AND FOR A DANGEROUS AND

649
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,066
EMTs AND

650
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:18,333
PARAMEDICS HAVE AN INJURY RATE

651
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,733
ABOUT THREE TIMES THE NATIONAL

652
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,133
AVERAGE AND THEY'RE ROUGHLY TEN

653
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,366
TIMES MORE LIKELY TO HAVE

654
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:27,000
SUICIDAL THOUGHTS OR BEHAVIORS.

655
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:28,209
SO IT'S NO WONDER THAT AMBULANCE

656
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,133
SERVICES CAN HAVE REAL TROUBLE

657
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,833
FINDING OR RETAINING WORKERS AND

658
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,076
VOLUNTEERS, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL

659
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,200
COMMUNITIES.

660
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,409
EXPERTS NOW WARN CLOSE TO ONE

661
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:38,733
THIRD OF ALL RURAL MEDICAL

662
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,166
SERVICES ARE IN IMMEDIATE DANGER

663
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:44,100
OF CLOSING DOWN.

664
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,666
IN RURAL MARMARTH,

665
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:47,466
NORTH DAKOTA, NO ONE REMEMBERS

666
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:48,033
THE LAST TIME THE TOWN HAD A

667
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,500
DOCTOR.

668
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:49,500
THE AMBULANCE IS THE COMMUNITY

669
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:50,900
SAFETY NET.

670
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:52,333
WE'RE LITERALLY ONE PERSON

671
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,000
AWAY FROM CLOSING IF WE LOSE ONE

672
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:53,900
OF OUR EMTs, ONE OF OUR CARE

673
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:54,366
PROVIDERS.

674
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,576
WE WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT SHUTTING

675
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,933
DOWN AND CLOSING OUR DOORS.

676
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,666
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

677
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:00,133
NO WORKPLACE SHOULD BE IN DANGER

678
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,900
OF SHUTTING DOWN BECAUSE IT

679
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:04,000
LOSES ONE PERSON.

680
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:05,933
UNLESS THAT WORKPLACE IS THE

681
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,700
"SEX AND THE CITY" REBOOT.

682
00:19:08,766 --> 00:19:10,700
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

683
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:11,976
IT'S NEVER GOING TO WORK WITHOUT

684
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,400
KIM CATTRALL.

685
00:19:12,466 --> 00:19:12,966
IT'S NOT THAT ANY OF YOU ARE

686
00:19:13,033 --> 00:19:14,153
BAD, IT'S THAT YOU ONLY WORK

687
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,933
TOGETHER.

688
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,333
I CAN'T APPRECIATE MY PURITAN

689
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,442
CHARLOTTE IF I DON'T HAVE MY

690
00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:18,900
NAUGHTY SAMANTHA.

691
00:19:18,966 --> 00:19:22,300
AND I LIVE FOR MIRANDA HOBBES,

692
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:24,166
BUT IF SHE'S NOT SERVING

693
00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:25,466
SIDE EYE WHILE SAMANTHA USES

694
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:26,433
PENNE PASTA TO DESCRIBE HER NEW

695
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,776
ITALIAN LOVER'S DICK, WHAT'S THE

696
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
POINT?

697
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,500
AND TO BE CLEAR, THIS ISN'T JUST

698
00:19:30,566 --> 00:19:33,333
A RURAL PROBLEM.

699
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,800
SOME BIG-CITY SERVICES ARE

700
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:35,400
STRETCHED TO BREAKING POINT,

701
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,933
TOO.

702
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,533
TAKE CHICAGO, WHERE ITS EMS IS

703
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,033
OPERATED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

704
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,066
BOTH WORKERS AND CITY OFFICIALS

705
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:44,566
HAVE COMPLAINED FOR YEARS THAT

706
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:45,533
NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES HAVE BEEN

707
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,033
ALLOCATED TO EMS, LEADING TO AN

708
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,566
AMBULANCE SHORTAGE.

709
00:19:48,633 --> 00:19:50,133
AND WHILE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT

710
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,500
SAYS ITS FLEET MEETS THE NEEDS

711
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:55,500
OF RESIDENTS, A LOCAL-NEWS

712
00:19:55,566 --> 00:19:56,066

OF THEM IT TOOK AN AMBULANCE

718
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:04,533
MORE THAN SEVEN MINUTES TO GET

719
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,066
TO THE SCENE.

720
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:06,933
SOMETIMES THERE JUST ISN'T

721
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,733
ONE.

722
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,633
WE'RE OUT OF AMBULANCES.

723
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,600
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW.

724
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:12,866
WOW.

725
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:13,866
"WE'RE OUT OF AMBULANCES."

726
00:20:13,933 --> 00:20:14,800
THAT IS NOT SOMETHING YOU WANT

727
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:17,066
TO HEAR.

728
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,176
I THINK WE ALL KNOW, WHEN YOU

729
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,900
CALL AN AMBULANCE, YOU

730
00:20:19,966 --> 00:20:20,500
WANT IT TO SHOW UP

731
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:21,200
LIKE THAT.

732
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:22,366
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

733
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:24,833
AW, NO.

734
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,100
I'M SORRY, GEORGE.

735
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:27,466
I DID IT AGAIN.

736
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:27,833
I'M SORRY.

737
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,666
HOW HARD IS IT NOT TO SNAP

738
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:29,800
YOUR FINGERS?

739
00:20:29,866 --> 00:20:31,933
Y'KNOW, IT TURNS OUT,

740
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,800
IT IS SURPRISINGLY HARD.

741
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:36,876
YOU KNOW, I GOT THE POWER TO

742
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,466
CLAP MY HANDS AND SUMMON KERMIT

743
00:20:37,533 --> 00:20:38,400
THE FROG, DO YOU THINK I DO IT?

744
00:20:38,466 --> 00:20:39,000
NO, I DO NOT.

745
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:39,833
BECAUSE I RESPECT KERMIT.

746
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,200
I GET THAT.

747
00:20:41,266 --> 00:20:42,366
BUT, HEY, GEORGE?

748
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:45,766
DO IT.

749
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,900
DO IT NOW.

750
00:20:47,966 --> 00:20:51,566
PLEASE.

751
00:20:53,066 --> 00:20:53,633
ALL RIGHT.

752
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,033
THIS BETTER BE GOOD, GEORGE.

753
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,366
IT'S NOT.

754
00:20:56,433 --> 00:20:57,133
WELL, I THOUGHT THAT

755
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,933
WENT VERY WELL.

756
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,866
ANYWAY, WHERE WERE WE?

757
00:20:59,933 --> 00:21:00,666
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

758
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:02,166
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES IN

759
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:03,513
AMERICA ARE UNDERFUNDED, BECAUSE

760
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,733
IN MOST PLACES, THEY'RE NOT

761
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,466
SUPPORTED BY FEDERAL PROGRAMS

762
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:07,676
AND LOCAL DOLLARS THE WAY THAT

763
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,633
POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS ARE.

764
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,766
AND THE FACT THEY ARE SO

765
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:14,942
UNDERFUNDED STARTS TO EXPLAIN

766
00:21:14,966 --> 00:21:15,833
WHY THEY CAN COST SO MUCH.

767
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,433
BECAUSE FOR MANY, THE WAY THEY

768
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,900
RECOUP THEIR COSTS IS BY BILLING

769
00:21:18,966 --> 00:21:20,066
PATIENTS.

770
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:21,633
ALTHOUGH INTERESTINGLY, IF THEY

771
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,976
DON'T PHYSICALLY TRANSPORT THOSE

772
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,300
PATIENTS TO A HOSPITAL, THEY CAN

773
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,933
BE OUT OF LUCK.

774
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,500
YOU'RE REIMBURSED BASED ON

775
00:21:28,566 --> 00:21:30,333
THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS THAT YOU

776
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,900
TRANSPORT TO A HOSPITAL.

777
00:21:31,966 --> 00:21:33,009
SO YOU COULD GET CALLED 1,000

778
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:35,333
TIMES A YEAR AND ONLY TRANSPORT

779
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,066
750 PATIENTS.

780
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:38,142
THOSE OTHER 250 CALLS, YOU MADE

781
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:41,266
NO MONEY ON.

782
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:41,933
YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

783
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,666
AND POLICIES LIKE THAT CAN NOT

784
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:44,100
ONLY PUT EMS PROVIDERS EVEN

785
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:44,900
FURTHER INTO A FINANCIAL HOLE,

786
00:21:44,966 --> 00:21:46,300
IT CAN ALSO INCENTIVIZE THEM TO

787
00:21:46,366 --> 00:21:47,600
TAKE PATIENTS TO THE HOSPITAL,

788
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:48,166
EVEN IF IT'S NOT TOTALLY

789
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:50,766
NECESSARY.

790
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,833
WHICH MAKES NO SENSE.

791
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,733
IT'S A PRACTICE KNOWN THROUGHOUT

792
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,942
THE EMS INDUSTRY AS "YOU CALL,

793
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:58,200
WE HAUL," WHICH IS A FUN PHRASE,

794
00:21:58,266 --> 00:21:59,866
ALTHOUGH TO BE HONEST, NOWHERE

795
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:01,366
NEAR AS FUN AS THE FIRE

796
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,333
"YOU HURT?

797
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,433
WE SQUIRT."

798
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,700
AND EMS'S FUNDING STRUCTURE

799
00:22:06,766 --> 00:22:07,500
DOESN'T JUST SERVE PROVIDERS

800
00:22:07,566 --> 00:22:08,400
POORLY... IT SERVES PATIENTS

801
00:22:08,466 --> 00:22:11,933
POORLY TOO.

802
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,766
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, PATIENTS AND

803
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:19,333
THEIR INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENTS,

804
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,933
ARE MOST EMS OUTFIT'S PRIMARY

805
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,066
FUNDING SOURCES, WHICH IS NOT A

806
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:23,866
GOOD SITUATION FOR EITHER SIDE.

807
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:24,666
SOME PATIENTS HAVE MEDICARE AND

808
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:25,533
MEDICAID... AND BY LAW, EMS

809
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,666
PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED TO ACCEPT

810
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:28,233
THEIR REIMBURSEMENT RATES,

811
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:28,833
DESPITE MANY SAYING THEY'RE SET

812
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,800
TOO LOW.

813
00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:37,866
BUT FOR PATIENTS WITH PRIVATE

814
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:40,366
INSURANCE, THE FACT IS, EMSes

815
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:41,000
ARE NOT REQUIRED TO ACCEPT THAT

816
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:41,766
AT ALL.

817
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:42,500
IN FACT, MANY CHOOSE TO KEEP

818
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:43,133
THEMSELVES OUT OF NETWORK FOR

819
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,766
MOST INSURERS, MEANING THEY CAN

820
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:44,466
GENERALLY SET THEIR RATES

821
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:45,233
WHEREVER THEY WANT.

822
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,309
THIS SITUATION CAN OFTEN LEAVE

823
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:46,900
PATIENTS FACING SO-CALLED

824
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:47,733
"SURPRISE BILLS."

825
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,066
SOME OF WHICH CAN BE ABSOLUTELY

826
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:51,600
RIDICULOUS.

827
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:53,266
BABY SAWYER JUST COULDN'T

828
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,800
WAIT TO ENTER THE WORLD.

829
00:22:54,866 --> 00:22:56,066
KATIE MORAIDA'S WATER BROKE A

830
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:57,966
WEEK BEFORE HE WAS DUE.

831
00:22:58,033 --> 00:22:58,900
SHE AND HUSBAND DANIEL RACED

832
00:22:58,966 --> 00:23:01,466
TO SUTTER ROSEVILLE.

833
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:05,366
WITH THE EMERGENCY ROOM IN

834
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:08,100
SIGHT, KATIE SCREAMS FOR HIM TO

835
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:08,766
STOP THE CAR.

836
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:10,033
HE SAID, "DON'T PUSH."

837
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,633
AND I SAID, "I HAVE TO PUSH."

838
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,100
SHE WENT LIKE THIS.

839
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:11,900
AND I PUSHED.

840
00:23:11,966 --> 00:23:12,666
AND THEN POP!

841
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:13,833
AND HE CAME OUT!

842
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,366
ROSEVILLE PD CALLED THE

843
00:23:14,433 --> 00:23:14,866
PARAMEDICS, WHO CUT THE

844
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:15,466
UMBILICAL CORD AND DROVE KATIE

845
00:23:15,533 --> 00:23:16,066
AND SAWYER A MATTER OF A FEW

846
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:16,666
HUNDRED YARDS TO THE HOSPITAL

847
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:17,933
DOOR.

848
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,733
THE ENTIRE TIME WITH A

849
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,100
PARAMEDIC, 10 MINUTES.

850
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,900
IT IS SUCH A BLUR.

851
00:23:21,966 --> 00:23:24,300
BUT LATER IT WOULD COME INTO

852
00:23:24,366 --> 00:23:25,533
FOCUS WHEN TWO EQUAL AMR

853
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,266
AMBULANCE BILLS SHOWED UP, ONE

854
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:28,666
FOR KATIE, ONE FOR BABY SAWYER,

855
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:31,233
TOTALING MORE THAN 3,500 BUCKS.

856
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,833
NOT EVEN A FULL MINUTE WORTH

857
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,466
OF AN AMBULANCE RIDE.

858
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:34,653
WE HAD ALREADY DONE THE HARD

859
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,100
PART.

860
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:39,000
WE DELIVERED OUR CHILD IN THE

861
00:23:39,066 --> 00:23:39,466
FRONT SEAT OF OUR CAR.

862
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:41,933
WELL, HOLD ON THERE.

863
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,233
DID "WE" REALLY DO THE HARD

864
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,133
PART, DAN?

865
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,276
BECAUSE FROM WHAT I JUST HEARD,

866
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:47,833
YOU DID SOME DRIVING, AND THEN

867
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,633
SAT BACK WHILE YOUR WIFE... IN

868
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,633
YOUR WORDS... "POPPED" OUT A

869
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,366
HUMAN, SO I'M NOT SURE YOU

870
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:53,133
REALLY "DID THE HARD PART," SO

871
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,100
MUCH AS YOU WERE JUST SORT OF

872
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,066
THERE.

873
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:55,733
C'MON, DAN.

874
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,600
BE AN ALLY.

875
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,366
READ A TWEET.

876
00:23:58,433 --> 00:23:59,442
AND THERE CAN BE ABSOLUTELY

877
00:23:59,466 --> 00:24:00,476
CRAZY EXAMPLES OF SURPRISE

878
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,609
BILLING, EVEN WHEN EMS IS RUN BY

879
00:24:01,633 --> 00:24:03,700
THE CITY.

880
00:24:03,766 --> 00:24:04,766
IN HOUSTON, LITERALLY ALL

881
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,333
CITY-RUN AMBULANCE SERVICES ARE

882
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,733
OUT-OF-NETWORK FOR ALL INSURERS.

883
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,200
AND A STUDY OF ONE LARGE

884
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:11,766
NATIONAL INSURANCE PLAN FOUND

885
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,400
THAT 71% OF AMBULANCE RIDES HAD

886
00:24:13,466 --> 00:24:15,166
THE POTENTIAL TO GENERATE A

887
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:17,966
SURPRISE BILL.

888
00:24:18,033 --> 00:24:19,533
AND WHEN YOU KNOW THAT, IS IT

889
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,066
ANY WONDER THAT WOMAN BEGGED

890
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:23,700
PEOPLE NOT TO CALL AN AMBULANCE?

891
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:25,000
OR THAT THIS INCREDIBLY GRIM

892
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:26,466
TREND HAS EMERGED:

893
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:29,866
AMBULANCE OR UBER?

894
00:24:29,933 --> 00:24:31,333
THAT'S NOW THE CHOICE AS MORE

895
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,733
AMERICANS ARE USING UBER AND

896
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,133
OTHER CAR SERVICES TO GET TO THE

897
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,600
EMERGENCY ROOM.

898
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:38,500
42-YEAR-OLD TECH MAGAZINE WRITER

899
00:24:38,566 --> 00:24:39,466
CHANDRA STEELE DID IT.

900
00:24:39,533 --> 00:24:40,333
WHAT WERE YOUR SYMPTOMS?

901
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,333
I HAD SOME INTERNAL BLEEDING

902
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
WHICH I ALREADY...

903
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:43,366
YOU HAD INTERNAL BLEEDING AND

904
00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:44,066
YOU TOOK AN UBER TO THE

905
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:46,166
HOSPITAL?

906
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:47,000
EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR ROBERT

907
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:47,933
GLATTER OF LENOX HILL HOSPITAL

908
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,076
IN NEW YORK SAYS UBER E.R., AS

909
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,466
IT'S BEEN NICKNAMED, IS NOT A

910
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:58,533
SMART IDEA IN A CRISIS.

911
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:02,466
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF

912
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:02,966
OXYGEN, THEY DON'T HAVE

913
00:25:03,033 --> 00:25:03,600
INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS OR IVs, THEY

914
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:04,100
DON'T HAVE PARAMEDICS.

915
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:04,866
THAT'S THE MAIN DIFFERENCE.

916
00:25:04,933 --> 00:25:08,566
THEY HAVE A DRIVER.

917
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:09,766
RIGHT!

918
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:10,100
THEY ALSO MAY

919
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:10,733
NOT KNOW WHICH LOCAL HOSPITAL

920
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,842
HAS A TRAUMA, STROKE, CARDIAC,

921
00:25:11,866 --> 00:25:12,200
OR PEDIATRIC UNIT.

922
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:12,800
BECAUSE THEY'RE UBER DRIVERS.

923
00:25:12,866 --> 00:25:13,366
THE MOST THEY HAVE ARE TINY

924
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:14,333
WATER BOTTLES YOU'RE AFRAID TO

925
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,233
DRINK FROM AND A CHARGER FOR A

926
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:15,900
SAMSUNG PHONE YOU DO NOT OWN.

927
00:25:15,966 --> 00:25:16,633
INSTEAD OF ALL OF

928
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,300
US PAYING A LITTLE BIT ALL THE

929
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:20,400
TIME FOR AMBULANCES, WE HAVE A

930
00:25:20,466 --> 00:25:21,866
SYSTEM WHERE SOME OF US PAY AN

931
00:25:21,933 --> 00:25:24,000
AWFUL LOT ALL AT ONCE WHEN WE

932
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:26,433
HAVE A TERRIBLE EMERGENCY.

933
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,866
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "HOW

934
00:25:27,933 --> 00:25:28,976
COULD THIS POSSIBLY GET ANY

935
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,666
WORSE?"

936
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:32,966
WELL, WAIT, IT CAN.

937
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,300
BECAUSE FOR-PROFIT BUSINESSES

938
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,700
ARE ALSO INVOLVED HERE... IN

939
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:36,266
FACT, CURRENTLY, PRIVATE

940
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,400
COMPANIES REPRESENT ABOUT 25% OF

941
00:25:38,466 --> 00:25:41,433
ALL AMBULANCE PROVIDERS.

942
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,800
AND MANY OF THEM ARE OWNED BY

943
00:25:42,866 --> 00:25:44,146
PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS WHO'VE BEEN

944
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,300
ACQUIRING DISTRESSED LOCAL

945
00:25:45,366 --> 00:25:46,800
AMBULANCE PROVIDERS FOR DECADES.

946
00:25:46,866 --> 00:25:47,909
REMEMBER THAT BABY WHO GOT A

947
00:25:47,933 --> 00:25:51,733
BILL FOR BEING BORN?

948
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,600
THAT CAME FROM A PRIVATE

949
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:54,200
FOR-PROFIT COMPANY, AMERICAN

950
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:56,566
MEDICAL RESPONSE.

951
00:25:56,633 --> 00:25:57,793
THEY'RE CURRENTLY THE LARGEST

952
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:59,433
AMBULANCE COMPANY IN THE U.S.

953
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,000
AND ARE OWNED BY ONE OF THE

954
00:26:00,066 --> 00:26:00,900
COUNTRY'S LARGEST PRIVATE EQUITY

955
00:26:00,966 --> 00:26:02,633
FIRMS.

956
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,700
AND WHEN A PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM

957
00:26:04,766 --> 00:26:07,233
SWOOPS IN TO HELP WRING PROFITS

958
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,133
OUT OF AMBULANCE SERVICES BY

959
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,500
KEEPING COSTS LOW AND REVENUES

960
00:26:09,566 --> 00:26:10,766
HIGH, THINGS GENERALLY DON'T

961
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:14,100
CHANGE FOR THE BETTER.

962
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:15,242
TAKE TRANSCARE, AN EMS COMPANY

963
00:26:15,266 --> 00:26:16,833
ACQUIRED OUT OF BANKRUPTCY BY A

964
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,066
PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM RUN BY THIS

965
00:26:19,133 --> 00:26:20,866
WOMAN, LYNN TILTON.

966
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:24,033
AND A FEW THINGS TO NOTE ABOUT

967
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,300
ASIDE FROM SERVING LOOKS THAT

968
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:28,866
CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS

969
00:26:28,933 --> 00:26:30,900
"MY STYLE ICONS ARE WAYNE NEWTON

970
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:32,300
AND A FERRERO ROCHER CANDY,"

971
00:26:32,366 --> 00:26:34,933
LYNN TILTON IS A SELF-DESCRIBED

972
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,566
POET, ALREADY ONE OF THE BIGGEST

973
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:37,133
RED FLAGS IMAGINABLE.

974
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,276
WE LOOKED, AND ONE OF THE ONLY

975
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,566
THINGS CLOSE TO POETRY WE COULD

976
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:40,913
FIND FROM HER WAS THIS INSTAGRAM

977
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:43,133
"I AM A WOMAN OF STRENGTH,

978
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,466
NOTHING CAN BREAK MY SPIRIT,

979
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:48,400
I AM WILD AND FREE,

980
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:49,466
I AM A WARRIOR OF LIGHT,

981
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,333
I AM ME."

982
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,066
WHICH FEELS LESS LIKE REAL

983
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:52,066
POETRY AND MORE LIKE SOMEONE

984
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:53,000
WITH A CONCUSSION TRYING TO

985
00:26:53,066 --> 00:26:53,966
REMEMBER KESHA LYRICS.

986
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:55,309
LYNN TILTON WAS ALSO THE STAR OF

987
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:57,066
THE SADLY CANCELED REALITY

988
00:26:57,133 --> 00:26:58,900
SERIES "DIVA OF DISTRESSED,"

989
00:26:58,966 --> 00:27:00,009
WHERE SHE PORTRAYED HERSELF AS A

990
00:27:00,033 --> 00:27:01,700
SAVIOR OF TROUBLED COMPANIES IN

991
00:27:01,766 --> 00:27:05,500
INSPIRATIONAL MOMENTS LIKE THIS:

992
00:27:05,566 --> 00:27:07,533
ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO IS WE

993
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,066
ALL COMMIT.

994
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:10,866
SO I'M GOING TO ASK YOU ALL TO

995
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:12,366
COMMIT WITH ME THAT WE WILL NOT

996
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:14,266
STOP UNTIL WE'VE ACHIEVED OUR

997
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,166
GOAL.

998
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:16,900
I COMMIT!

999
00:27:16,966 --> 00:27:17,966
WE COMMIT.

1000
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:19,033
THANK YOU.

1001
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,433
COMMIT, COMMIT!

1002
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,800
NO PUSSIES IN MY MILL!

1003
00:27:22,866 --> 00:27:28,466
SHE SEEMS GREAT.

1004
00:27:28,533 --> 00:27:29,800
AND LYNN TILTON CERTAINLY KNOWS

1005
00:27:29,866 --> 00:27:30,966
HOW TO INSTILL A SENSE OF

1006
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:31,833
COURAGE IN THOSE AROUND HER.

1007
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,733
REMINDS ME OF THAT FAMOUS FDR

1008
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,333
"THE ONLY THING WE HAVE

1009
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,066
TO FEAR IS PUSSIES IN MY MILL."

1010
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:37,433
AND TILTON PROMISED TO BRING

1011
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,700
THAT UPLIFTING LEADERSHIP TO

1012
00:27:38,766 --> 00:27:40,933
TRANSCARE.

1013
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,400
BUT MANY WHO WORKED THERE

1014
00:27:42,466 --> 00:27:44,166
DESCRIBED ROUGH CONDITIONS ON

1015
00:27:44,233 --> 00:27:46,033
HER WATCH, WITH ONE FORMER

1016
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,333
EMPLOYEE SAYING THEY WERE SENT

1017
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,033
OUT IN A VEHICLE WHERE THE

1018
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,433
BRAKES DIDN'T WORK PROPERLY AND

1019
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,642
DURING THE 2014 EBOLA SCARE HAD

1020
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:52,933
TROUBLE GETTING ENOUGH SANITARY

1021
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,700
WIPES TO DISINFECT THEIR

1022
00:27:53,766 --> 00:27:55,966
AMBULANCES.

1023
00:27:56,033 --> 00:27:57,700
FORMER STAFF EVEN SAID THEY WERE

1024
00:27:57,766 --> 00:27:59,400
PRESSURED BY TRANSCARE

1025
00:27:59,466 --> 00:28:00,866
SUPERVISORS TO GO "E.R.

1026
00:28:00,933 --> 00:28:03,700
SHOPPING," MEANING THEY'D STEAL

1027
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:04,500
MEDICAL SUPPLIES FROM THE E.R.s

1028
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:06,833
TO RESTOCK THEIR AMBULANCES.

1029
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,733
AND WHEN TRANSCARE INEVITABLY

1030
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,600
ENDED UP FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY

1031
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:14,066
IN 2016, ITS EMPLOYEES FOUND OUT

1032
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:14,700
THAT THEY'D LOST THEIR JOBS LIKE

1033
00:28:14,766 --> 00:28:15,500
THIS.

1034
00:28:15,566 --> 00:28:16,866
WORKERS WERE TOLD THEY HAD 30

1035
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:17,600
DAYS LEFT ON THE JOB.

1036
00:28:17,666 --> 00:28:18,966
THEY SHOWED UP TODAY TO FIND

1037
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:21,133
THIS.

1038
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,233
TRANSCARE WAS SHUTTERED.

1039
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,600
I WAS IN SHOCK.

1040
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:26,700
WE WERE ALL IN SHOCK.

1041
00:28:26,766 --> 00:28:32,266
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

1042
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:32,933
IT'S ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.

1043
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,633
A WORK EMERGENCY FOR DOZENS

1044
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,133
OF PARAMEDICS.

1045
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,866
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO FIND

1046
00:28:34,933 --> 00:28:35,700
ANOTHER JOB.

1047
00:28:35,766 --> 00:28:36,566
I HAVE ANOTHER SIDE JOB TO

1048
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:37,742
SUPPORT ME RIGHT NOW, CURRENTLY,

1049
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:40,266
BUT THAT DOESN'T PAY THE BILLS.

1050
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,266
LAST NIGHT WE WERE TOLD, "SEE

1051
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:43,033
YOU TOMORROW.

1052
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,033
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT."

1053
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:46,666
WELL, THAT'S FUCKED UP.

1054
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:47,300
THERE ARE CERTAIN BUSINESSES YOU

1055
00:28:47,366 --> 00:28:48,100
ASSUME MIGHT DISAPPEAR

1056
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:50,466
OVERNIGHT, LIKE A KID'S LEMONADE

1057
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:51,100
STAND OR ANY CIRCUIT CITY IN

1058
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:52,600
THE LATE 2000s.

1059
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:54,466
INCIDENTALLY, THEY ALL BECAME

1060
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:56,600
KINGDOMS OF OPTICAL CABLES AND

1061
00:28:56,666 --> 00:28:57,500
LOOSE BATTERIES GOVERNED BY

1062
00:28:57,566 --> 00:28:58,066
RATS, AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY

1063
00:28:58,133 --> 00:29:00,766
FINE.

1064
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:01,700
BUT IT IS NOT GREAT WHEN WHAT'S

1065
00:29:01,766 --> 00:29:02,300
DISAPPEARING IS A COMMUNITY'S

1066
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,733
LIFE-SAVING MEDICAL SERVICE.

1067
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,333
AND IT'S NOT JUST THAT TRANSCARE

1068
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,966
FOLDED... IT'S THAT, IN A

1069
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:08,400
BANKRUPTCY COURT RULING LAST

1070
00:29:08,466 --> 00:29:09,766
YEAR, A JUDGE RECOMMENDED

1071
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:11,533
FINDING TILTON LIABLE FOR NEARLY

1072
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,866
$42 MILLION FOR STRIPPING VALUE

1073
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:14,466
OUT OF THE COMPANY.

1074
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:17,533
WHICH ISN'T TOTALLY SHOCKING

1075
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,166
FROM A WOMAN WHOSE EMPLOYEES

1076
00:29:19,233 --> 00:29:23,100
WERE ENCOURAGED TO STRIP VALUE

1077
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:23,900
OUT OF FUCKING EMERGENCY ROOMS.

1078
00:29:23,966 --> 00:29:24,976
NOW, I HAVE TO SAY: TILTON

1079
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,933
DENIES HAVING DONE ANYTHING

1080
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,466
WRONG AND HAS CHALLENGED THAT

1081
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:28,833
RECOMMENDATION IN FEDERAL COURT.

1082
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,100
AND THE THING IS, I'M NOT JUST

1083
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:32,833
MAD WITH LYNN TILTON HERE.

1084
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,333
I'M MAD THAT WE'RE OPERATING A

1085
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,100
SYSTEM WHERE A VITAL SERVICE IS

1086
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:37,533
LEFT VULNERABLE TO THE

1087
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,800
LYNN TILTONS OF THE WORLD.

1088
00:29:39,866 --> 00:29:41,026
SO WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THIS?

1089
00:29:41,066 --> 00:29:42,633
WELL, AS I'VE SAID BEFORE,

1090
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,600
IDEALLY, WE'D TRANSITION TO A

1091
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:44,866
MEDICARE FOR ALL APPROACH, BUT

1092
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:45,466
THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE IN THE

1093
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,900
CARDS RIGHT NOW.

1094
00:29:46,966 --> 00:29:48,433
AND IN THE MEANTIME, THERE ARE

1095
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,200
SMALLER THINGS WE COULD DO.

1096
00:29:51,266 --> 00:29:52,833
FOR PATIENTS, WE NEED TO PUT AN

1097
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,900
END TO SURPRISE BILLING.

1098
00:29:54,966 --> 00:29:56,700
THE GOOD NEWS IS, CONGRESS

1099
00:29:56,766 --> 00:29:59,633
PASSED A BILL LAST YEAR CALLED

1100
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,776
THE "NO SURPRISES ACT," MAKING

1101
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,066
IT ILLEGAL TO SEND PATIENTS

1102
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:03,866
STEEP MEDICAL BILLS WHEN AN

1103
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:04,766
OUT-OF-NETWORK PROVIDER IS

1104
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:05,600
UNEXPECTEDLY INVOLVED IN THEIR

1105
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:06,800
CARE.

1106
00:30:06,866 --> 00:30:08,666
THE BAD NEWS IS, WHILE THAT

1107
00:30:08,733 --> 00:30:11,300
APPLIES TO AIR AMBULANCES, THE

1108
00:30:11,366 --> 00:30:11,766
BILL, FOR SOME REASON,

1109
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:13,266
EXPLICITLY CARVED OUT GROUND

1110
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:13,566
AMBULANCES.

1111
00:30:13,633 --> 00:30:14,533
MOST FUCKING

1112
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,100
AMBULANCES.

1113
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:18,333
WE SHOULD

1114
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,666
ESTABLISH A LEAD FEDERAL AGENCY

1115
00:30:19,733 --> 00:30:22,033
DEDICATED TO THEM.

1116
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,109
AND THEY SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE

1117
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:24,666
LABELED AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE.

1118
00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:26,166
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

1119
00:30:26,233 --> 00:30:28,600
EVERYONE THINKS THEY ARE.

1120
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:30,200
BUT FOR THAT LABEL TO MEAN

1121
00:30:30,266 --> 00:30:32,100
SOMETHING, IT HAS TO COME WITH

1122
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:33,500
FUNDING AT THE LOCAL, STATE, AND

1123
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:35,200
FEDERAL LEVELS.

1124
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:36,466
AND THERE'S NO BETTER TIME TO

1125
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:38,633
MAKE THOSE BIG CHANGES THAN

1126
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,500
RIGHT NOW, WHEN WE STILL

1127
00:30:39,566 --> 00:30:40,609
REMEMBER THE ABSOLUTE HELL OF

1128
00:30:40,633 --> 00:30:42,333
WHAT THESE WORKERS WENT THROUGH

1129
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,733
LAST YEAR.

1130
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,566
REMEMBER THAT PARADE THAT BILL

1131
00:30:45,633 --> 00:30:46,733
DE BLASIO PROMISED?

1132
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,433
IT ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE LAST

1133
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,300
MONTH, BUT YOU KNOW WHO NOTABLY

1134
00:30:49,366 --> 00:30:51,066
DIDN'T ATTEND?

1135
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:52,666
EMTs, MANY OF WHOM BOYCOTTED IT

1136
00:30:52,733 --> 00:30:54,566
BECAUSE OF STAGNANT WAGES AND

1137
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:56,666
THE FACT THAT THEY WORKED DURING

1138
00:30:56,733 --> 00:31:00,166
THE PANDEMIC WITHOUT HAZARD PAY.

1139
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,100
LAST YEAR, EVERYONE WAS

1140
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:04,633
ANXIOUS TO SHOW HOW MUCH THEY

1141
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,833
SUPPORTED EMTs.

1142
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,666
WELL, NOW'S THE TIME TO PROVE IT

1143
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:09,842
AND MAKE BIG CHANGES ON THEIR

1144
00:31:09,866 --> 00:31:11,300
BEHALF.

1145
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:14,266
AND IF WE DO THAT, MAYBE WE'LL

1146
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,566
COLLECTIVELY BE WORTHY OF A

1147
00:31:16,633 --> 00:31:17,753
SIREN THAT SOUNDS LIKE THIS:

1148
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:25,366
GET YOURS, MICKEY, YOU FILTHY

1149
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:25,933
MOUSE.

1150
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,900
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

1151
00:31:26,966 --> 00:31:28,700
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

1152
00:31:28,766 --> 00:31:29,300
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

1153
00:31:29,366 --> 00:31:30,366
GOOD NIGHT!
