1
00:00:27,866 --> 00:00:28,537
HI THERE!

2
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:29,575
WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

3
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,175
STILL TAKING PLACE

4
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,833
IN THIS BLANK VOID.

5
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,109
IT'S ACTUALLY THE PLACE ALL YOUR

6
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,566
AIRPODS GO WHEN YOU LOSE THEM.

7
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:35,500
I BET YOU THOUGHT THIS WAS

8
00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:36,400
RATTLING AROUND YOUR CAR'S

9
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:37,333
FLOOR MATS.

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,233
NOPE... IT'S MINE NOW!

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,266
INTO THE PILE YOU GO!

12
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,233
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK,

13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,433
FROM REPUBLICANS TRYING

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,200
TO OUST LIZ CHENEY FROM

15
00:00:44,266 --> 00:00:44,733
HOUSE LEADERSHIP,

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
TO CALIFORNIA GEARING UP

17
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:46,966
FOR THE RECALL ELECTION OF

18
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:48,466
GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM.

19
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:50,833
MULTIPLE CANDIDATES HAVE ALREADY

20
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,066
FILED TO RUN AGAINST HIM, ONE

21
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:53,200
OF WHOM RELEASED THIS AD:

22
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:53,766
THIS BEAUTY HAS PROVEN HE

23
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:54,300
CAN'T DO IT.

24
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:55,366
PRETTY BOY.

25
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:00,266
THE BEAST CAN.

26
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:01,642
THIS TIME, MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE

27
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:02,566
FOR CALIFORNIA AND YOUR FAMILY.

28
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:04,400
RECALL THE BEAUTY, AND ELECT

29
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:05,833
THE NICEST, SMARTEST BEAST

30
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,433
YOU'VE EVER MET.

31
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,700
JOHN COX.

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,033
ALL OF THAT'S IDIOTIC,

33
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,033
BUT I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE

34
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,800
FACT THAT HE SEEMS TO THINK

35
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:22,266
THE PROBLEM IN "BEAUTY AND

36
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,409
THE BEAST" WAS ABOUT CHOOSING

37
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:24,609
BETWEEN THE TWO, WHEN EVERYONE

38
00:01:24,633 --> 00:01:25,366
KNOWS THE PROBLEM WAS, HOW ARE

39
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:25,833
THESE TWO FUCKING?

40
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,400
WE KNOW IT'S HAPPENING,

41
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:28,300
WE KNOW IT'S GREAT,

42
00:01:28,366 --> 00:01:32,033
AND WE KNOW IT'S WEIRD,

43
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,033
BUT HOW EXACTLY DOES IT WORK?

44
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:33,733
DO THEY TAKE SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS

45
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,840
AROUND THE FLAMES TO AVOID

46
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:35,733
BURNING, OR IS THE BURNING PART

47
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,300
OF IT?

48
00:01:36,366 --> 00:01:37,486
SAME QUESTION, BUT ABOUT THE

49
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:38,266
FEATHER DUSTER AND SNEEZING,

50
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:44,266
IS THE SNEEZING PART OF IT?

51
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:44,866
I HOPE THE SNEEZING IS PART OF

52
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:45,633
IT!

53
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,633
THAT GUY COMMITTED TO THE BEAR

54
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,709
METAPHOR, EVEN BRINGING ONE

55
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:48,600
TO A CAMPAIGN EVENT, ONLY

56
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:49,500
TO COMPLAIN THE NEXT DAY THAT

57
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:50,133
"THE COVERAGE YESTERDAY WAS ALL

58
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,366
ABOUT THE BEAR."

59
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:55,533
AND YEAH, NO SHIT.

60
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,333
YOU BROUGHT A LITERAL

61
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,266
DANCING BEAR.

62
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,100
THE UNIVERSAL METAPHOR FOR

63
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:58,966
"DISTRACTING GIMMICK PEOPLE PAY

64
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:00,109
ATTENTION TO INSTEAD OF WHATEVER

65
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:02,000
THE FUCK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT."

66
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:04,133
MEANWHILE, THE WEEK SAW

67
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,600
THE LATEST ATTEMPTS TO UNDERMINE

68
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:06,500
THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS,

69
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:07,600
WITH TEXAS AND FLORIDA

70
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:08,266
CONTINUING THE TREND OF

71
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,466
REPUBLICANS ENACTING

72
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:11,566
NEW VOTING RESTRICTIONS.

73
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:13,433
FLORIDA'S GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS

74
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,733
...A MAN WITH A VIBE THAT

75
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
SCREAMS "WILL FLIRT WITH YOUR

76
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:17,766
TEENAGE FRIENDS"... SIGNED

77
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:23,400
A BILL, LIVE ON

78
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:25,333
"FOX AND FRIENDS," FOR SOME

79
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,442
REASON, THAT TARGETS BALLOT DROP

80
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:27,500
BOXES AND VOTING BY MAIL.

81
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:28,466
MEANWHILE, IN TEXAS, THEIR NEW

82
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:29,400
VOTER-SUPPRESSION BILL INITIALLY

83
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:29,900
FEATURED A LINE ABOUT THE

84
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:30,966
IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING

85
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,009
"THE PURITY OF THE BALLOT BOX,"

86
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:33,042
LEADING TO THIS AWKWARD EXCHANGE

87
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:34,300
WITH ONE OF ITS SPONSORS.

88
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:35,700
DID YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY

89
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:39,200
BEFORE USING THAT WORD?

90
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:40,442
NO, NO, THE ONLY THING, IF WE

91
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:41,000
WERE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION...

92
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:42,333
MAYBE OVER SOME COFFEE OR

93
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,166
DRINKS, ONE DAY, I COULD GO INTO

94
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:43,900
THE DETAILS OF ARTICLE ONE

95
00:02:43,966 --> 00:02:45,100
REALLY WELL.

96
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,733
I'VE READ THE DEBATES AND THE

97
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,066
JOURNALS OF THE CONVENTION OF

98
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:51,166
1875 ON THAT, FOR THAT THING,

99
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:58,166
BUT I'M NOT FAMILIAR.

100
00:02:58,233 --> 00:02:59,376
YOU MAY HAVE MISSED IT THEN.

101
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,100
THAT PROVISION WAS DRAFTED

102
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,033
SPECIFICALLY TO DISENFRANCHISE

103
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,933
BLACK PEOPLE... BLACK VOTERS,

104
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,100
IN FACT... FOLLOWING

105
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:03,900
THE CIVIL WAR.

106
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:04,600
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

107
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:05,676
NO, THAT'S... THAT'S... I'M

108
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,600
SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

109
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,666
YEAH, I BET YOU ARE!

110
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:10,033
ALTHOUGH, I'M GUESSING YOU'RE

111
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,833
LESS "SORRY TO HEAR THE

112
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,266
HISTORICAL CONNOTATIONS OF THAT

113
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,576
PHRASE " AND MORE, " SORRY TO HEAR

114
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,000
THAT PUBLICLY, ESPECIALLY IN

115
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:19,733
FRONT OF ALL THESE FUCKING

116
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,433
CAMERAS."

117
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,566
BUT PERHAPS THE STUPIDEST

118
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:22,266
ELECTION-RELATED STORY IS

119
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,633
CURRENTLY TAKING PLACE IN

120
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,500
ARIZONA, WHERE REPUBLICANS HAVE

121
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:25,642
BEEN TRYING TO RELITIGATE THE

122
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,366
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION BY

123
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:27,233
RECOUNTING ALL THE BALLOTS

124
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,000
IN THE STATE'S MOST POPULOUS

125
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:28,866
COUNTY.

126
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:29,866
THIS IS YET ANOTHER TALLY OF

127
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:30,733
THE NEARLY 2.1 MILLION BALLOTS

128
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,133
IN MARICOPA COUNTY.

129
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,242
BUT THIS SO-CALLED AUDIT IS

130
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:36,833
UNLIKE ANY OTHER.

131
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,100
THESE ARE BALLOT COUNTERS

132
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,866
HEADING INTO A SHIFT.

133
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:41,076
HAVE YOU EVER DONE ELECTION

134
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,866
COUNTING BEFORE?

135
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:43,633
NO.

136
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,533
BUT IT'S... THERE'S NOTHING TO

137
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,966
IT.

138
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:49,300
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS.

139
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:50,266
YEAH, THAT'S NOT

140
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,333
REASSURING!

141
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:54,133
NORMALLY WHEN A GUY IN THOSE

142
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,433
SUNGLASSES SAYS, "THERE'S

143
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,033
NOTHING TO IT, IT'S PRETTY

144
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,800
OBVIOUS," HE'S SECONDS FROM

145
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:02,600
REVERSING HIS BRAND NEW ATV

146
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:03,300
THROUGH THE FRONT WINDOW OF A

147
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:08,500
FUDDRUCKERS.

148
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:09,466
THE AUDIT COMPANY IN CHARGE,

149
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:10,466
CYBER NINJAS, IS OWNED BY AN

150
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:11,200
ADVOCATE OF THE STOP THE STEAL

151
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:11,933
MOVEMENT.

152
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,800
AND OBVIOUS BIAS ASIDE,

153
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:13,733
THE PROCESS ALONE SEEMS SEEMS

154
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,666
PRETTY SLIPSHOD.

155
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:15,909
ARIZONA'S SECRETARY OF STATE HAS

156
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:17,233
EXPRESSED ALARM OVER ACCOUNTS OF

157
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,866
BALLOTS BEING LEFT UNATTENDED,

158
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:18,733
AND UNTRAINED WORKERS USING

159
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
DIFFERENT RULES TO COUNT

160
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:24,066
BALLOTS.

161
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:26,733
ALL OF WHICH THE AUDIT OFFICIAL

162
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,700
TWITTER ACCOUNT

163
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:28,900
DISPUTED AS "BASELESS

164
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:30,600
CLAIM-EES."

165
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,233
AND IT'S GENUINELY INSANE TO

166
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,466
SWOOP INTO A COUNTY THAT,

167
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:35,000
REMEMBER, HAS ALREADY DONE

168
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,600
MULTIPLE AUDITS OF ITS ELECTION

169
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,000
COUNT, FINDING NO EVIDENCE OF

170
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:39,466
FRAUD... WITH THE ATTITUDE OF,

171
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:40,800
"OKAY, BUT WHAT IF WE DO IT

172
00:04:40,866 --> 00:04:42,500
SHITTY THIS TIME?"

173
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:44,233
AND IT GETS EVEN WORSE WHEN YOU

174
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,866
CONSIDER THE SECRETARY OF STATE

175
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:49,500
IS NOW RECEIVING DEATH THREATS.

176
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:50,642
AND ALL OF THIS IS SO THEY CAN

177
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,676
CHASE DOWN CRAZY CONSPIRACY

178
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,066
THEORIES LIKE THIS ONE.

179
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:54,333
THERE'S ACCUSATIONS THAT

180
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,000
40,000 BALLOTS WERE FLOWN IN.

181
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:56,966
TO ARIZONA?

182
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:57,766
TO ARIZONA.

183
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:58,733
AND IT WAS STUFFED INTO THE BOX,

184
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,700
OKAY?

185
00:05:01,766 --> 00:05:03,233
AND IT CAME FROM THE SOUTHEAST

186
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,833
PART OF THE WORLD, ASIA, OKAY?

187
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,233
AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS TO

188
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,442
FIND OUT IF THERE'S BAMBOO IN

189
00:05:09,466 --> 00:05:10,566
THE PAPER.

190
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:11,200
AND WHY DO YOU CHECK FOR

191
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:12,000
BAMBOO?

192
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:14,133
BECAUSE THEY USE BAMBOO IN

193
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,000
THEIR PAPER PROCESSING.

194
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:17,300
WHO'S THEY?

195
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:17,900
PEOPLE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA.

196
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:19,500
WOW.

197
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:21,733
"SOUTHEAST ASIANS ATTEMPTED TO

198
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,300
SWAY THE 2020 ELECTION IN

199
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:24,466
ARIZONA VIA BAMBOO BALLOTS"

200
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,900
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING YOUR

201
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:27,333
DRUNKEST UNCLE WOULD SAY BEFORE

202
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,600
PASSING OUT AT HIS NIECE'S

203
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,366
SIXTH BIRTHDAY PARTY.

204
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:32,333
AND LOOK, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY

205
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:32,933
NONSENSE.

206
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,900
AND IN FAIRNESS TO THAT MAN,

207
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,300
HE DOESN'T BELIEVE ANY OF IT.

208
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:37,333
HE RUNS A NONPROFIT FOCUSED

209
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,266
ON ELECTION FAIRNESS, AND IS

210
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,000
VOLUNTEERING, HOPING THIS

211
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:42,309
PROCESS MANAGES TO DISPROVE MANY

212
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,900
OF THESE CRAZY THEORIES.

213
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:48,266
WHICH IS A NICE IDEA.

214
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,633
THE PROBLEM IS, THOUGH, THE

215
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,533
PEOPLE BEHIND THIS RECOUNT

216
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,200
AREN'T GOING

217
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:52,276
TO BE CONVINCED, UNLESS THE

218
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,500
RESULTS SWING THEIR WAY.

219
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:54,400
AND WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE...

220
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:55,066
AGAIN... THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN

221
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:56,209
MULTIPLE AUDITS CONDUCTED IN

222
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:57,533
MARICOPA COUNTY AND THEY WEREN'T

223
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,233
CONVINCED BY THE RESULTS.

224
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,200
AND THE THING IS, ARIZONA IS

225
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:07,066
PLAYING A DANGEROUS GAME HERE.

226
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,433
AND THINGS ARE PROBABLY ONLY GET

227
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,066
MORE VOLATILE.

228
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:09,733
ARIZONA'S

229
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,500
RECOUNT IS LIKE THAT GUY

230
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:11,766
BRINGING A BEAR TO HIS EVENT,

231
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,233
IN THAT IT'S CHAOTIC,

232
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,409
IT'S PATHETICALLY DESPERATE, AND

233
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:15,700
WE'LL ALL BE LUCKY IF NOBODY

234
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:16,766
GETS SERIOUSLY HURT.

235
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:17,833
AND NOW THIS.

236
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:21,133
AND NOW...

237
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,666
HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY FROM THE

238
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:25,066
DISAPPOINTING MEN OF LOCAL NEWS.

239
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:26,200
I GOT A LOT OF MOMS,

240
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:29,733
RELATED MOMS IN MY FAMILY.

241
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,100
MY WIFE IS A MOM, MY MOM MOM.

242
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,966
YOUR MOM MOM.

243
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:33,666
MY STEPMOM AND MY

244
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:34,100
MOTHER-IN-LAW.

245
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:34,500
SO.

246
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:37,533
WOW.

247
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,933
YEAH, I GOT FOUR PEOPLE THAT

248
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:41,533
I DISAPPOINT.

249
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,900
SHE HINTED YOU SHOULD KNOW

250
00:06:44,966 --> 00:06:45,566
WHAT TO GET HER FOR THIS

251
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:46,133
MOTHER'S DAY.

252
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,233
DID YOU FIGURE THIS OUT?

253
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,100
NO, I DIDN'T.

254
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:48,800
ACTUALLY, I DID SUGGEST

255
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:49,700
SOMETHING THAT I THOUGHT SHE

256
00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:50,776
WANTED, AND THEN SHE TOLD ME,

257
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,533
NO, THAT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE

258
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:52,733
IDEA.

259
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,533
MOTHER'S DAY IS SUNDAY.

260
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,000
DO NOT FORGET.

261
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:54,933
HIGH TEMPERATURES ARE

262
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,400
54 DEGREES.

263
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:58,100
IF YOU HAVE ANY GOOD IDEAS FOR

264
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,600
MY WIFE, LET ME KNOW.

265
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:00,800
LAST YEAR, I GOT MY WIFE,

266
00:07:00,866 --> 00:07:01,633
LIKE, A $40 BOUQUET FOR

267
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,800
MOTHER'S DAY.

268
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:05,333
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

269
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:05,966
THIS YEAR, I AM BUYING FOR FOUR

270
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:07,900
MOMS.

271
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:13,100
SO $10 BOUQUETS ALL AROUND.

272
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:13,933
DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I

273
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,700
MADE.

274
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:15,633
DON'T GIVE HER A WONDERBRA FOR

275
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,200
MOTHER'S DAY.

276
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:17,133
NATHAN, YOU GOT YOUR MOTHER

277
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,800
YOUR MOTHER'S DAY GIFT READY FOR

278
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:19,066
MOM AND YOUR WIFE?

279
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:20,133
YEAH.

280
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,900
MOVING ON.

281
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:24,666
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

282
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:25,333
HAIR.

283
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,333
SPECIFICALLY, BLACK HAIR.

284
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,066
THE SUBJECT THAT GAVE US

285
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:29,033
THE SINGLE GREATEST

286
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,300
"REAL HOUSEWIVES" ENTRANCE

287
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,300
OF ALL TIME:

288
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:32,866
WHEN KENYA MOORE CRASHED

289
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:33,766
MARLO HAMPTON'S WIG LAUNCH WITH

290
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,433
A MARCHING BAND TO PROMOTE HER

291
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,509
OWN LINE OF HAIR PRODUCTS, AND

292
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:38,033
PORSHA WILLIAMS REACTED LIKE

293
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,600
THIS.

294
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,533
EVEN IF I DID AGREE WITH

295
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,776
KENYA AND THE FACT THAT PEOPLE'S

296
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,400
EDGES MATTER, THEY DON'T MATTER

297
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:44,766
TODAY, BITCH.

298
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,600
YOU ARE WRONG.

299
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,800
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INSANE, OKAY?

300
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:50,533
SO TODAY, I DON'T AGREE.

301
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,766
BUT TOMORROW, YES, MY EDGES

302
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:52,566
MATTER, AND I'LL BE USING THE

303
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:52,800
PRODUCT.

304
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:54,500
YOU KNOW WHAT?

305
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:56,700
AS PER USUAL, PORSHA IS RIGHT

306
00:07:56,766 --> 00:07:57,933
ABOUT A NUMBER OF THINGS:

307
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,733
KENYA IS WRONG, EDGES DO MATTER

308
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,900
AND I, LIKE PORSHA, WILL BE

309
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:03,133
USING THE PRODUCT TOMORROW.

310
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,500
MONDAY IS MY WASH DAY.

311
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:06,576
AND LOOK, I REALIZE I'M NOT

312
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,900
THE IDEAL PERSON TO TALK ABOUT

313
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:09,366
BLACK HAIR.

314
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:11,300
I LOOK LIKE I STILL GO TO AN

315
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,666
OLD TIMEY BARBER NAMED VALENTINO

316
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:13,466
AND ASK FOR "THE TIDY

317
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:15,400
LIZA MINNELLI."

318
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:16,866
AND I ALSO KNOW THAT THE DANGER

319
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:17,800
IS, WHEN A WHITE GUY ON TV

320
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:19,300
STARTS CONFIDENTLY TALKING ABOUT

321
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,666
BLACK HAIR, EVEN WITH THE BEST

322
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:22,833
OF INTENTIONS, IT CAN END

323
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,800
SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

324
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:25,600
I DIDN'T WANT THE LITTLE

325
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:26,466
TEA LIGHT TO OVERHEAT AND THEN

326
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:27,466
ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE'VE GOT

327
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:28,033
BREAKING NEWS HERE AT THE

328
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,500
CHANNEL.

329
00:08:28,566 --> 00:08:29,609
I TOLD YOU IF THE SPRINKLER

330
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:30,333
SYSTEMS COME ON, I'M DONE FOR

331
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,600
THE DAY.

332
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:31,666
YEAH.

333
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:32,766
YOU KNOW, THAT IS NOT...

334
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:33,400
SITTING UP HERE LOOKING LIKE

335
00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:33,633
A MOP.

336
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,000
THAT IS NOT.

337
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:34,266
YEAH.

338
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,700
YOU KNOW WHAT?

339
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,009
SPRINKLER SYSTEM AND A BEAUTIFUL

340
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:38,266
WEAVE BECAUSE, THEY DO NOT GO.

341
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,600
AHH!

342
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:40,233
WHAT?

343
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,500
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

344
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:42,566
YOU SAID IT WAS A WEAVE,

345
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:42,933
RIGHT?

346
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,400
IT'S NOT!

347
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:45,800
OH, MY GOD!

348
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,400
WOW.

349
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:54,709
THAT IS THE EXACT RIGHT REACTION

350
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:55,300
TO ANNOUNCING YOUR BLACK

351
00:08:55,366 --> 00:08:56,833
COWORKER'S HAIR IS A WEAVE

352
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,466
LIVE ON-AIR.

353
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:58,066
GETTING UP FROM YOUR DESK AND

354
00:08:58,133 --> 00:08:58,800
JUST RUNNING AWAY.

355
00:08:58,866 --> 00:08:59,800
RUNNING FOREVER.

356
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:00,800
RUNNING UNTIL YOUR LIFE FADES

357
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:01,633
BEHIND YOU AND YOUR FEET TOUCH

358
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,300
THE OCEAN.

359
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:04,866
NOW YOU SHOULD KNOW, THOSE TWO

360
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:06,533
COWORKERS SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN

361
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,700
OVER THAT INCIDENT, PUTTING OUT

362
00:09:08,766 --> 00:09:10,042
A VIDEO TITLED "BLAINE AND LAILA

363
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:11,700
A REBUTTAL,"

364
00:09:11,766 --> 00:09:12,666
WHERE BLAINE SAYS HE'S LEARNED

365
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:13,433
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

366
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,766
QUICK WEAVES, LACEFRONTS, AND

367
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,366
SEW-INS BECAUSE OF THEIR

368
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:16,666
FRIENDSHIP.

369
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:18,100
BUT THE FACT IS, ON THE WHOLE,

370
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,066
WHITE PEOPLE DON'T REALLY

371
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:20,033
UNDERSTAND A LOT ABOUT

372
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,333
BLACK HAIR.

373
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,476
AND BY THE WAY, IF YOUR FIRST

374
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,433
REACTION TO THAT WAS,

375
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,833
"HEY, NOT ALL WHITE PEOPLE,"

376
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,233
MAYBE LOOK INSIDE YOURSELF AND

377
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,133
FIGURE OUT WHY THAT IS YOUR

378
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,466
RESPONSE TO THINGS.

379
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:29,866
BUT IMPORTANTLY, THAT LACK OF

380
00:09:29,933 --> 00:09:31,400
UNDERSTANDING... AND LACK OF

381
00:09:31,466 --> 00:09:32,833
INTEREST IN UNDERSTANDING... CAN

382
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,366
HAVE REAL CONSEQUENCES, FROM THE

383
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:36,200
PERSONAL TO THE PROFESSIONAL,

384
00:09:36,266 --> 00:09:37,700
AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW, EITHER

385
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:38,666
FROM EXPERIENCE, OR FROM SEEING

386
00:09:38,733 --> 00:09:40,133
STORIES LIKE THIS:

387
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,666
CHASTITY JONES WAS TANGLED

388
00:09:41,733 --> 00:09:43,266
IN A NEARLY 10-YEAR LEGAL BATTLE

389
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,800
AFTER SHE SAYS AN EMPLOYER TOOK

390
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:47,833
BACK A JOB OFFER AT AN ALABAMA

391
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,733
CALL CENTER BECAUSE SHE REFUSED

392
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,033
TO CUT HER HAIR.

393
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,500
SHE SAID, "ARE THOSE

394
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:56,300
DREADLOCKS IN YOUR HAIR?"

395
00:09:56,366 --> 00:09:58,800
AND I JUST LOOKED AT HER AND

396
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:01,533
I WAS LIKE, "THESE?"

397
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,033
AND SHE SAID, "YES."

398
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,400
I SAID, "YES, THEY ARE."

399
00:10:06,466 --> 00:10:07,966
SHE SAID, "WELL, WE CAN'T ACCEPT

400
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:10,300
THAT HERE."

401
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:12,166
CAN YOU IMAGINE TURNING

402
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:13,933
SOMEONE AWAY WHO WANTS TO WORK

403
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,142
AT A CALL CENTER, THE UNIVERSE'S

404
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,200
MOST THANKLESS JOB?

405
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:18,276
A PLACE WHERE YOU ANSWER THE

406
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,666
PHONE AND IMMEDIATELY, THERE'S

407
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:21,766
AN ANGRY WOMAN SCREAMING AT YOU

408
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,042
BECAUSE SOME OF THE BROCCOLI IN

409
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:24,146
HER HELLO FRESH KIT "DIDN'T

410
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,242
SMELL RIGHT" AND NOW SHE WANTS

411
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:26,866
TO SPEAK TO MR. FRESH.

412
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:28,766
IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO

413
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:29,933
DO THAT JOB, LET THEM!

414
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,433
WHAT'S ON THEIR HEAD HAS NOTHING

415
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,600
TO DO WITH IT!

416
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,900
THEY COULD SHOW UP TO WORK

417
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,766
IN A WIG MADE OF LIVING FERRETS,

418
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:36,842
AND THEY DESERVE NOT ONLY THAT

419
00:10:36,866 --> 00:10:37,600
POSITION, BUT DOUBLE WHATEVER

420
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,066
YOU'RE PAYING THEM.

421
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:44,066
THE POINT IS, BLACK HAIR IS

422
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:45,033
AND HAIRSTYLES FREQUENTLY YET

423
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,933
ANOTHER TARGET OF

424
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,766
DISCRIMINATION.

425
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,300
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.

426
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:49,646
AND LET'S START BY UNDERSTANDING

427
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,566
WHY BLACK HAIR IS SO IMPORTANT.

428
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:53,833
FOR CENTURIES, BLACK PEOPLE IN

429
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:55,233
AFRICA INNOVATED WAYS TO PROTECT

430
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,342
AND PROLONG THE HEALTH OF THEIR

431
00:10:56,366 --> 00:10:57,533
HAIR, AND THAT PRACTICE HAS

432
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,700
CONTINUED AND EVOLVED INTO

433
00:10:58,766 --> 00:11:00,266
BEAUTIFUL AND DISTINCT

434
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,100
HAIRSTYLES, WITH A DEEP

435
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,300
CONNECTION TO CULTURE AND

436
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:03,566
HERITAGE.

437
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:05,400
AND FOR AS LONG AS THAT HAS

438
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:06,542
HAPPENED, WHITE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

439
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,000
UNABLE TO HANDLE IT.

440
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:09,800
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS

441
00:11:09,866 --> 00:11:11,433
SLAVE TRADERS WOULD DO WAS

442
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,600
SHAVE THE HEADS OF ENSLAVED

443
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,433
PEOPLE, WHICH ERASED THEIR

444
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,500
CULTURAL IDENTITY.

445
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:17,500
AND BLACK HAIR HAS HISTORICALLY

446
00:11:17,566 --> 00:11:18,100
BEEN DESCRIBED IN DEHUMANIZING

447
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,566
FASHION, WITH RACIAL TYPOLOGIST

448
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:21,033
CHARLES HAMILTON SMITH

449
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,633
DESCRIBING HIS HIERARCHY OF

450
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,600
THREE MAIN TYPES OF PEOPLE:

451
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,809
THE BEADED CAUCASIAN TYPE, THE

452
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,166
BEARDLESS MONGOLIC TYPE, AND THE

453
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:30,000
"WOOLLY-HAIRED TROPICAL TYPE."

454
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:31,866
AND THE ONLY TIME "WOOLLY-HAIRED

455
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:34,400
TROPICAL" IS AN ACCEPTABLE TERM

456
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:34,966
TO USE IS IF YOU'RE TALKING

457
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:36,200
ABOUT MADAGASCAR'S

458
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:37,333
"WOOLLY LEMUR," A TROPICAL

459
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,542
LITTLE SWEETIE WHO ALWAYS LOOKS

460
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:39,100
LIKE HE JUST ACCIDENTALLY

461
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:39,966
REPLIED ALL.

462
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,466
OTHER THAN THAT,

463
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:43,333
IT'S OFF LIMITS.

464
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,933
BY THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY,

465
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,033
BEAUTY COMPANIES WERE

466
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,233
ADVERTISING PRODUCTS LIKE

467
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,566
SKIN LIGHTENERS AND

468
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:50,033
HAIR STRAIGHTENERS, REINFORCING

469
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,933
THE IDEA THAT BLACK HAIR WAS

470
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,500
DIRTY AND UNKEMPT, AND THE

471
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:54,133
CLOSER YOUR APPEARANCE WAS TO

472
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,566
WHITENESS, THE BETTER.

473
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,742
LIKE IN THIS AD FROM 1900 FOR A

474
00:11:57,766 --> 00:11:59,200
MAGNETIC COMB THAT PROMISED TO

475
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:01,000
DESTROY THE "HAIR GERMS" ON YOUR

476
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:02,166
HEAD AND TAKE YOU FROM A

477
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:03,166
CURLY-HAIRED BLACK PERSON TO

478
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:05,400
A STRAIGHT-HAIRED WHITE ONE.

479
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:06,576
AND THE DESIRE TO MAKE BLACK

480
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
HAIR SMOOTHER AND STRAIGHTER

481
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,000
WAS SO STRONG, JUST LISTEN TO

482
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:11,933
THE SHEER DELIGHT THIS BRITISH

483
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,076
NEWSREEL TAKES IN SHOWING THE

484
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,233
PROCESS.

485
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,466
COMBS COME INTO PLAY.

486
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:17,776
KEPT CONSTANTLY HEATED, THEY ARE

487
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,909
PASSED THROUGH EACH SECTION OF

488
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:20,433
THE HAIR UNTIL ALL TRACE OF

489
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,600
KINKINESS DISAPPEARS.

490
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,300
IT'S NOT ALL PLAIN SAILING

491
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:24,966
NATURALLY, AND IT'S NOT QUITE

492
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:25,733
A PERMANENT PERMANENT, IF YOU

493
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,566
FOLLOW ME.

494
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:29,366
IF THE HAIR GETS REALLY WET OR

495
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:30,553
STEAMED UP, IT UNSTRAIGHTENS

496
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,566
ITSELF AND BACK COME THE KINKS.

497
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:33,766
OH, NOO.

498
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:37,766
HEARING THAT BEAUTY STANDARD

499
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,933
REINFORCED IN THAT PARTICULAR

500
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,433
VOICE IS DEFINITELY A SIGN THAT

501
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,400
SOMETHING HAS GONE TERRIBLY

502
00:12:44,466 --> 00:12:44,766
WRONG.

503
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:45,633
AND I KNOW FOR SOME VIEWERS,

504
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,809
PASSING A HOT METAL COMB THROUGH

505
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,666
THE HAIR TO STRAIGHTEN IT MIGHT

506
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:48,533
LOOK LIKE A CURIO FROM THE

507
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,300
DISTANT PAST.

508
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:50,646
BUT I GUARANTEE SOME OF YOU WERE

509
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,400
JUST TRANSPORTED BACK TO BEING

510
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:53,766
8-YEARS-OLD SITTING ON A HIGH

511
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,333
STOOL IN THE KITCHEN AT 6:00 AM

512
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,600
ON SCHOOL PICTURE DAY, HOLDING

513
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:57,566
YOUR EARS DOWN WHILE YOUR MOM OR

514
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:58,566
GRANDMA GETS THE HOT COMB

515
00:12:58,633 --> 00:13:00,266
UNCOMFORTABLY CLOSE TO YOUR

516
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:00,466
SCALP.

517
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:01,466
FOR SOME, THE SMELL OF BURNING

518
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:02,333
HAIR IS A SIGN THAT SOMETHING'S

519
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:02,733
WRONG.

520
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,433
BUT FOR OTHERS, IT BRINGS BACK

521
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,866
MEMORIES.

522
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:08,133
BY THE 1960s AND '70s, THOUGH,

523
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,209
THE EMBRACE OF BLACK HAIR'S

524
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:11,133
NATURAL TEXTURE AND CULTURALLY

525
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,360
SIGNIFICANT STYLES HAD BECOME

526
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,542
A RADICAL ACT OF SELF ACCEPTANCE

527
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:15,533
AND POLITICAL POWER.

528
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,766
WHO TAUGHT YOU TO HATE

529
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,333
THE TEXTURE OF YOUR HAIR?

530
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,000
WHO TAUGHT YOU TO HATE THE COLOR

531
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,466
OF YOUR SKIN?

532
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:24,800
TO SUCH EXTENT THAT YOU BLEACH,

533
00:13:24,866 --> 00:13:27,866
TO GET LIKE THE WHITE MAN?

534
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,200
UH, WHITE PEOPLE.

535
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:29,766
THE ANSWER IS WHITE PEOPLE.

536
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:30,993
THAT QUESTION ANSWERS ITSELF.

537
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:32,533
JUST LIKE THE ANSWER TO THE

538
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,500
WHO LETS THEIR DOGS

539
00:13:33,566 --> 00:13:34,566
KISS THEM IN THE MOUTH?

540
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,533
WHO WANTS TO PICK APPLES

541
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,433
FOR FUN?

542
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,333
AND WHO'S COMING TO DINNER ON

543
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,633
INA GARTEN'S SHOW?

544
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,233
THE ANSWER IS, WHITE PEOPLE.

545
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,100
BUT DESPITE THE NATURAL HAIR

546
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,700
MOVEMENT, WHITE PEOPLE'S

547
00:13:43,766 --> 00:13:44,809
DISCOMFORT AND IGNORANCE AROUND

548
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:45,666
BLACK HAIR HAS VERY MUCH

549
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:47,100
REMAINED.

550
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,100
ONE STUDY FOUND BLACK WOMEN WERE

551
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,500
80% MORE LIKELY TO AGREE WITH

552
00:13:50,566 --> 00:13:52,166
THE STATEMENT, "I HAVE TO CHANGE

553
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:53,766
MY HAIR FROM ITS NATURAL STATE

554
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,200
TO FIT IN AT THE OFFICE," AND

555
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:56,833
ANOTHER FOUND THAT BLACK WOMEN

556
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,976
WITH NATURAL HAIRSTYLES WERE

557
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,100
PERCEIVED TO BE LESS

558
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,566
PROFESSIONAL, LESS COMPETENT,

559
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:01,833
AND LESS LIKELY TO BE

560
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,200
RECOMMENDED FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.

561
00:14:03,266 --> 00:14:05,333
THE POINT IS, THE WAY YOUR HAIR

562
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,366
IS PERCEIVED... AND THEREFORE,

563
00:14:07,433 --> 00:14:08,966
THE WAY YOU ARE PERCEIVED... CAN

564
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:10,666
MANIFEST IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS.

565
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:13,100
I KNOW THE ANXIETY THAT

566
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,600
PEOPLE HAVE AFTER GETTING THEIR

567
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:15,566
HAIR DONE THEN, LIKE, "OKAY,

568
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:16,333
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN I GO

569
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
TO WORK?

570
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:18,333
ARE THEY GONNA SAY ANYTHING?"

571
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,633
YOU KNOW, IT'S A BIG THING

572
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,966
IN THE WORKPLACE.

573
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:22,366
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO

574
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:23,333
DRAW ATTENTION TO THEIR SELF

575
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,766
SO THEY TRY TO DO THE NORM.

576
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:25,766
A LOT OF THE TIME, I WOULD

577
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,300
ALWAYS GET PEOPLE JUST, LIKE,

578
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,200
SAYING HOW, LIKE, SOFT MY HAIR

579
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:29,733
IS AND EVERYTHING AND LIKE

580
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,166
WANTING TO TOUCH IT.

581
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:31,000
THAT'S, LIKE, ALWAYS A BIG

582
00:14:31,066 --> 00:14:31,366
THING.

583
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:32,033
NO, YOU CAN'T TOUCH IT.

584
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,733
AND, LIKE, ADULTS DOING THAT

585
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,700
TOO, I'M LIKE...

586
00:14:33,766 --> 00:14:34,600
IT'S GROWN WOMEN.

587
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,666
YOU CAN'T TOUCH IT!

588
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,833
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T TOUCH

589
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,733
NO BLACK WOMEN'S HAIR, YOU

590
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,700
ALREADY KNOW THAT, LIKE...

591
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:39,633
IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE

592
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,333
IN A ZOO.

593
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,000
LOOK, YOU OBVIOUSLY

594
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:46,209
SHOULDN'T BE MADE TO FEEL LIKE

595
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:47,500
YOU'RE IN A ZOO, EVER, FOR ANY

596
00:14:47,566 --> 00:14:47,733
REASON.

597
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,666
ALSO... AND IT'S NOT THE POINT

598
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:49,600
...BUT IF YOU'RE TOUCHING

599
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,966
ANIMALS AT THE ZOO, YOU'RE DOING

600
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:52,533
THE ZOO WRONG.

601
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,500
DON'T BE STRESSING THE OTTERS

602
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:54,666
OUT BY SHOUTING UNWANTED

603
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:55,566
QUESTIONS AND TRYING TO SNEAK

604
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:56,233
YOUR HANDS INTO THE CAGES TO

605
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,133
COP A FEEL.

606
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,600
YES, THE BALD EAGLE'S FEATHERS

607
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,000
ARE LAID, BUT DON'T SHOUT

608
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:00,866
"YAAAS, QWEEN" AND TRY TO PET

609
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:01,733
HER.

610
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,366
UNLIKE YOUR COWORKERS,

611
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:03,566
THE EAGLE WILL SNAP YOUR

612
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:07,000
FUCKING FINGERS OFF.

613
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:08,176
AND YOU WILL HAVE IT COMING.

614
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,900
UNFORTUNATELY, THOUGH,

615
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:10,133
WHITE PEOPLE'S BIASES AND

616
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,866
IGNORANCE ARE OFTEN JUST LAYING

617
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:12,800
IN WAIT FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT

618
00:15:12,866 --> 00:15:13,966
TO STRIKE.

619
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:15,566
JONATHON SUTHERLAND IS THE

620
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:16,933
PENN STATE FOOTBALL CAPTAIN AND

621
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,466
A DEAN'S LIST STUDENT.

622
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:20,100
BUT WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING

623
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,466
ABOUT TONIGHT IS HIS HAIR.

624
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:24,166
THAT'S THANKS TO THIS LETTER.

625
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:25,366
THE AUTHOR IS A PROCLAIMED

626
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:26,633
ALUMNUS FROM DECADES AGO NAMED

627
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:27,376
DAVID PETERSEN.

628
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:28,837
HE CALLS SUTHERLAND'S HAIR

629
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:29,533
"AWFUL."

630
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,600
STATING HIS LOCS ARE

631
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,676
"DISGUSTING AND ARE CERTAINLY

632
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,257
NOT ATTRACTIVE."

633
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:35,132
HE ALSO WRITES,

634
00:15:35,157 --> 00:15:36,289
"WE WOULD WELCOME THE

635
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,833
REAPPEARANCE OF DRESS CODES

636
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,000
FOR ATHLETES."

637
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:40,566
EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT'S

638
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:40,833
UPSETTING.

639
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,766
FROM THE RACIST ATTITUDE,

640
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:42,833
TO THE HURTFUL LANGUAGE,

641
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,033
TO THE FACT THAT HE CHOSE

642
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,900
TO EXPRESS MORAL OUTRAGE OVER

643
00:15:44,966 --> 00:15:45,500
SOMETHING IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL,

644
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:46,400
BUT IT'S NOT THAT THE NCAA MAKES

645
00:15:46,466 --> 00:15:47,609
MILLIONS OFF STUDENT ATHLETES,

646
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:48,642
INSTEAD, IT'S "I CAN SEE YOUR

647
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,300
HAIR OUTSIDE YOUR HELMET."

648
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,366
THAT MAN LATER EXPLAINED HE ONLY

649
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:53,466
WROTE THE LETTER BECAUSE

650
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:55,966
"I WAS JUST DISGRUNTLED ABOUT

651
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:56,600
SOME OF THE HAIRDOS THAT WE'RE

652
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,433
SEEING.

653
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,633
YOU THINK OF PENN STATE AS A

654
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,133
BUNCH OF CLEAN-CUT GUYS."

655
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,866
AND "YOU THINK OF PENN STATE

656
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:03,766
AS" IS JUST NOT A SENTENCE THAT

657
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:04,466
ENDS WELL UNDER

658
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:05,900
ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.

659
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,966
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU REALIZE,

660
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:11,933
THAT MAN ACTUALLY GOT A DEGREE

661
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,500
FROM PENN STATE IN 1966, THE

662
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:13,733
SAME YEAR AS JERRY SANDUSKY.

663
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,840
WHO SOMEHOW... DESPITE HIS

664
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,766
SHORT HAIR... TURNED OUT TO BE

665
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,366
A HEINOUS SEX CRIMINAL.

666
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:19,333
I KNOW IT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS,

667
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,676
BUT IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE HAIRCUT

668
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,933
DOESN'T FUCKING MATTER.

669
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,933
AND IT STARTS WAY BEFORE

670
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,333
COLLEGE.

671
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,300
YOU MAY REMEMBER THE TERRIBLE

672
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:28,233
CASE OF HIGH SCHOOL WRESTLER

673
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:28,866
ANDREW JOHNSON, WHO WAS

674
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:30,300
BASICALLY FORCED TO CUT HIS LOCS

675
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:31,733
OFF OR FORFEIT AN IMPORTANT

676
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,466
WRESTLING MATCH BY A REFEREE.

677
00:16:33,533 --> 00:16:34,766
THAT CASE MADE NATIONAL NEWS,

678
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,233
BUT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF OTHERS

679
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,433
THAT DON'T.

680
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,742
FROM THE SCHOOL IN KENTUCKY THAT

681
00:16:38,766 --> 00:16:40,100
ONCE BANNED... AND I QUOTE...

682
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,733
"DREADLOCKS AND CORN ROLLS,"

683
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,366
TO TWIN SISTERS IN MASSACHUSETTS

684
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:44,576
THAT RECEIVED HOURS OF DETENTION

685
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,233
BECAUSE OF THEIR BRAIDED HAIR,

686
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,233
TO THIS DAYCARE IN SUBURBAN

687
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,433
CHICAGO.

688
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,266
MOM MAY LIKE THE SMELL,

689
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,566
BUT ACCORDING TO THIS NOTE

690
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:53,233
TIONNA NORRIS POSTED ON HER

691
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,400
FACEBOOK PAGE,

692
00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:55,933
AMIA'S TEACHER DIDN'T LIKE IT,

693
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,633
BASICALLY SAYING...

694
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,566
YOUR CHILD STINKS.

695
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:59,966
DON'T PUT THE COCONUT OIL

696
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:00,266
IN HER HAIR.

697
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,133
THE KIDS WERE TEASING HER.

698
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,933
NORRIS SAYS AMIA WAS THE ONLY

699
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,133
BLACK CHILD IN HER PRESCHOOL

700
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,166
CLASS AT THE RAGGEDY ANNE

701
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:08,500
LEARNING CENTER IN ELMHURST.

702
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,433
I WAS JUST HURT FOR MY CHILD.

703
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,933
ESPECIALLY AFTER NORRIS SAYS

704
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,042
SHE MET WITH THE TEACHER AND

705
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,109
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR AND LEARNED

706
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:14,966
THE CHILDREN IN THE CLASS NEVER

707
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,366
COMPLAINED.

708
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:18,033
IT WAS JUST THE TEACHER WHO

709
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,900
DIDN'T LIKE THE SMELL.

710
00:17:19,966 --> 00:17:21,333
WE CALLED THE SCHOOL AND LEFT

711
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,500
SEVERAL MESSAGES.

712
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:24,700
WE VISITED AND GOT THIS.

713
00:17:24,766 --> 00:17:25,842
HI, I'M DOROTHY TUCKER FROM

714
00:17:25,866 --> 00:17:26,366
CHANNEL 2 NEWS.

715
00:17:26,433 --> 00:17:28,333
GOODBYE.

716
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,466
WOW.

717
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:31,066
THAT FEELS LIKE A PERFECTLY

718
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,400
STAGED FIVE-SECOND PLAY

719
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:33,509
ENCAPSULATING THE HISTORY OF

720
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:35,066
RACE RELATIONS IN AMERICA:

721
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:36,666
A BLACK PERSON TRYING TO DISCUSS

722
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:38,133
RACIAL INEQUALITY WITH A WHITE

723
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,900
PERSON, WHO THEN IMMEDIATELY

724
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:42,166
SAYS, "GOODBYE!"

725
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:43,342
SO BLACK PEOPLE, FROM AN EARLY

726
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:44,766
AGE, ARE OFTEN TOLD THEIR HAIR

727
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:45,666
IS UNATTRACTIVE.

728
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:49,133
AND NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED.

729
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,300
AND THAT IS ALREADY JUST...

730
00:17:50,366 --> 00:17:51,442
A LOT, BEFORE YOU EVEN START

731
00:17:51,466 --> 00:17:52,400
GETTING INTO ALL THE WAYS THAT

732
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:53,900
SOCIETY MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO

733
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:54,633
NAVIGATE THE WORLD BECAUSE OF

734
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,533
YOUR HAIR.

735
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,266
EVEN JUST BUYING HAIR PRODUCTS

736
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,166
CAN BE AN UNNECESSARY CHALLENGE,

737
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:00,533
WITH BLACK HAIR PRODUCTS

738
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,233
ROUTINELY LOCKED IN A CASE WHERE

739
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,000
SOMEONE HAS TO COME WITH A KEY

740
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:05,566
TO GET IT FOR YOU... OR MAYBE

741
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:07,266
EVEN "WALK IT TO THE REGISTER"

742
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,766
...IN THE SAME AISLE WHERE

743
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:09,876
PRODUCTS FOR WHITE PEOPLE THAT

744
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,266
COST JUST AS MUCH OR MORE ARE

745
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,600
SIMPLY SITTING OUT ON THE

746
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:14,833
SHELVES.

747
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,600
AND THE EXPLANATION FOR THAT IS

748
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:16,733
NEVER GREAT.

749
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,766
SO I WENT AND FOUND THE

750
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,333
MANAGER AND I SAID, "I'M WAITING

751
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,566
FOR THE KEY FOR SHAMPOO AND

752
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:24,166
CONDITIONER."

753
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:25,800
I SAID, "BUT LET ME ASK YOU,

754
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:27,266
WHY ARE THE BLACK HAIR PRODUCTS

755
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,166
LOCKED UP AND NOT THE WHITE HAIR

756
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,133
PRODUCTS?"

757
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,280
HE SAID, "UMM," AND ANOTHER

758
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,666
ASSOCIATE SAID, "WELL, PEOPLE

759
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:35,400
HAVE BEEN STEALING."

760
00:18:35,466 --> 00:18:36,966
YEAH.

761
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,400
NOW THAT WALMART CLAIMED IT WAS

762
00:18:38,466 --> 00:18:39,200
BASED ON DATA OF THEFT

763
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:40,433
IN THE STORE.

764
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,233
BUT WHEN A TOWN COUNCIL MEMBER

765
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,533
ASKED TO SEE THAT DATA, THE

766
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,066
STORE INSTRUCTED HER TO CALL

767
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:47,033
"1-800-WALMART."

768
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,100
AND JUST OUT OF INTEREST,

769
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,433
ON A TOUCHTONE PHONE, WHICH

770
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,233
BUTTON DO YOU PRESS TO HEAR THE

771
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,833
BULLSHIT DATA USED TO JUSTIFY

772
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,400
LOCKING UP $4 ECO STYLER GEL?

773
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,576
IS THAT, LIKE, NUMBER 7 OR DO

774
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,842
YOU HAVE TO ASK FOR AN ASSOCIATE

775
00:18:56,866 --> 00:18:58,566
FIRST?

776
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:00,400
SO IT'S ALREADY HARD ENOUGH TO

777
00:19:00,466 --> 00:19:01,100
GET PRODUCTS TO DO YOUR HAIR AT

778
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,666
HOME.

779
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:04,500
BUT FINDING A QUALIFIED STYLIST

780
00:19:04,566 --> 00:19:05,666
CAN BE EVEN HARDER.

781
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:08,666
THE COSMETOLOGY INDUSTRY MOSTLY

782
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:09,533
REVOLVES AROUND, AND TRAINS FOR,

783
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,833
CARING FOR STRAIGHT,

784
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,966
NON-TEXTURED HAIR.

785
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:16,066
SO THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT

786
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:16,700
A STYLIST IN YOUR AREA CAN WORK

787
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:18,800
WITH BLACK HAIR... JUST WATCH

788
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,333
ONE TIKTOKER CALL 23 SALONS IN

789
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,266
THEIR HOMETOWN, AND GET NOTHING

790
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,500
BUT RESPONSES LIKE THESE.

791
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:24,933
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU GUYS

792
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,433
WORK WITH AFRICAN-AMERICAN HAIR,

793
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,833
SPECIFICALLY 4C TYPE?

794
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,266
UH, WE DO NOT.

795
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,442
NONE OF THE GIRLS HERE DO, NO.

796
00:19:32,466 --> 00:19:33,333
UM, WE DON'T REALLY HAVE

797
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,600
A LOT OF EXPERIENCE.

798
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,033
SO I WOULD SAY YOU'RE PROBABLY

799
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,100
BETTER TO KEEP LOOKING AROUND.

800
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:40,800
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU GUYS

801
00:19:40,866 --> 00:19:41,666
WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH

802
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:42,966
AFRICAN-AMERICAN HAIR,

803
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:46,600
SPECIFICALLY 4C TYPE?

804
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,733
OH!

805
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,566
HOLD ON JUST A MINUTE!

806
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:50,400
LET ME ASK!

807
00:19:50,466 --> 00:19:51,400
IS ANYBODY FAMILIAR WITH

808
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:54,566
AFRICAN-AMERICAN HAIR?

809
00:19:54,633 --> 00:19:57,300
NOT VERY MUCH.

810
00:19:57,366 --> 00:19:59,000
YEAH, THAT'S NOT GREAT.

811
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:01,200
BUT I DO LOVE THAT RECEPTIONIST

812
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,000
IS ASKING THE ENTIRE STAFF,

813
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:02,866
LIKE SHE JUST GOT CALLED AS A

814
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:03,500
PHONE-A-FRIEND ON

815
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:04,866
"WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE."

816
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:06,009
"HEY, DONNA, IT'S THE $25,000

817
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:07,800
QUESTION.

818
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:08,766
CAN YOU DO A SILK PRESS AND BUMP

819
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,100
THOSE ENDS?

820
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,300
SHE CAN'T."

821
00:20:13,366 --> 00:20:14,526
AND THIS ISN'T JUST A PROBLEM

822
00:20:14,566 --> 00:20:16,800
IN SALONS... EVEN IN HOLLYWOOD,

823
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:18,500
STYLISTS WHO ARE BOTH FAMILIAR

824
00:20:18,566 --> 00:20:20,133
WITH BLACK HAIR AND IN THE

825
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,633
HAIRSTYLISTS' UNION ARE RARE.

826
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,266
AND ACTORS DEFINITELY KNOW WHEN

827
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,933
THEIR PRODUCTION FAILED TO HIRE

828
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,766
ONE.

829
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,100
I WAS ON THIS SHOW.

830
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,833
THEY MADE ME A SERIES REGULAR.

831
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,800
I WAS HELLA PUMPED, WALKED IN

832
00:20:29,866 --> 00:20:30,366
THE HAIR AND MAKEUP TRAILER

833
00:20:30,433 --> 00:20:31,100
FIRST TIME.

834
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:31,933
"OH, SHIT.

835
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,633
I'M ABOUT TO, LIKE, GET PAID.

836
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,266
LET ME SEE."

837
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,533
HOMEGIRL, THIS WHITE LADY,

838
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,966
SHE TAPPED MY HEAD.

839
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:38,566
YUP!

840
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:41,100
NOT LYING, SHE TAPPED IT,

841
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,100
SPRAYED SOME WATER... DIDN'T

842
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,233
BRUSH, DIDN'T COMB, AND LEFT.

843
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,380
AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, WILD!"

844
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:46,866
I ACTUALLY RECOMMEND

845
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:48,600
GOING BACK AND WATCHING EACH

846
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,233
ACTOR IN THAT CLIP AS HE TELLS

847
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,600
THAT STORY,

848
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,033
BECAUSE YOU REALLY GET THE SENSE

849
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,633
THAT

850
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,809
EVERY ONE OF THEM IDENTIFIES

851
00:20:58,833 --> 00:20:59,600
WITH WHAT HE'S SAYING.

852
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,366
AND IT'S NOT IDEAL THAT FOR

853
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:03,000
A LOT OF HAIRSTYLISTS, THEIR

854
00:21:03,066 --> 00:21:03,566
STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH BLACK

855
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:04,166
CLIENTS IS THE SAME YOU'D USE

856
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:04,800
TO GET YOUR CAT OFF THE KITCHEN

857
00:21:04,866 --> 00:21:05,133
COUNTER.

858
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,700
GIVE THEM A LITTLE SPRITZ AND

859
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:07,909
THEN GIVE THEM A PAT ON THE HEAD

860
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,800
SO THEY KNOW YOU'RE NOT MAD.

861
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:09,533
AND WHEN YOU CONSIDER ALL OF

862
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,300
THE OBSTACLES THAT GET PLACED IN

863
00:21:11,366 --> 00:21:12,766
THE PATH OF BLACK PEOPLE, IT'S

864
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,066
UNDERSTANDABLY PRETTY HARD TO

865
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:16,066
TAKE WHEN WHITE PEOPLE WEAR THE

866
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:16,900
SAME EXACT SAME HAIRSTYLES THAT

867
00:21:16,966 --> 00:21:18,200
THEY GET JUDGEMENT FOR.

868
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:20,633
FROM BO DEREK, FAMOUSLY WEARING

869
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,133
BRAIDS IN THE MOVIE "10" TO

870
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,700
ADELE AND MILEY CYRUS TRYING ON

871
00:21:24,766 --> 00:21:25,366
BLACK HAIRSTYLES FOR FUN, TO

872
00:21:25,433 --> 00:21:26,633
THIS COMME DES GARCONS FASHION

873
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:31,000
SHOW, AT WHICH THE MODELS WORE

874
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:32,300
LACE FRONT CORNROW WIGS,

875
00:21:32,366 --> 00:21:32,833
WHICH WERE AWFUL IN EVERY

876
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,300
POSSIBLE WAY.

877
00:21:34,366 --> 00:21:35,633
I MEAN, LOOK AT THAT THING!

878
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,066
THERE IS ENOUGH ROOM BETWEEN

879
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:37,633
EACH BRAID TO LAND A FUCKING

880
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,809
PLANE, AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE

881
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:39,466
TO LOOK CLOSELY TO SEE THE

882
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:40,166
MODEL'S DARK HAIR THROUGH THE

883
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:40,366
LACE.

884
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:41,500
COME ON!

885
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,266
YOU PUT A WIG CAP ON FIRST,

886
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,633
THEN YOU PUT THE WIG ON!

887
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,866
YOU GRAB YOUR GOT2B SPRAY

888
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:47,666
OR WIG GLUE, YOU MELT THAT LACE,

889
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:48,600
AND YOU LAY THOSE EDGES DOWN

890
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,066
SO WELL THEY FALL ASLEEP.

891
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:51,333
THERE ARE ONLY TWO SITUATIONS

892
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,200
WHERE THAT APPALLING LEVEL OF

893
00:21:53,266 --> 00:21:54,100
WIG APPLICATION IS ACCEPTABLE:

894
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,900
EITHER YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF

895
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:57,142
HOSTING AN EPISODE OF "SNL," OR

896
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:57,733
YOU'RE POSING AS A BRITISH NANNY

897
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,633
TO STAY CLOSE TO YOUR CHILDREN

898
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,633
AFTER YOUR DIVORCE.

899
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,066
THAT IS IT.

900
00:22:03,133 --> 00:22:04,566
AND THE THING IS, WHITE PEOPLE

901
00:22:04,633 --> 00:22:06,133
APPROPRIATING BLACK HAIRSTYLES

902
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,033
ISN'T JUST INFURIATING... IT CAN

903
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,400
DIRECTLY MAKE IT HARDER FOR

904
00:22:09,466 --> 00:22:10,833
BLACK PEOPLE TO FIGHT

905
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,909
DISCRIMINATION CONCERNING THEIR

906
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:12,866
HAIR.

907
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:16,066
THERE WAS A COURT CASE, 1981,

908
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:17,733
A DISCRIMINATION SUIT FILED BY A

909
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,266
BLACK WOMAN NAMED RENEE ROGERS.

910
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,733
SHE'D WORKED FOR AMERICAN

911
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,366
AIRLINES AND SHE WORE HER HAIR

912
00:22:21,433 --> 00:22:23,233
IN CORNROWS.

913
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,766
HER LEGAL ARGUMENT WAS THAT HER

914
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:25,909
HAIRSTYLE WAS A PART OF HER

915
00:22:25,933 --> 00:22:30,300
CULTURAL HERITAGE.

916
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:31,666
THE JUDGE RULED AGAINST HER IN

917
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:33,100
FEDERAL COURT BECAUSE HE SAID

918
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,900
SHE GOT HER HAIR DONE SOON AFTER

919
00:22:35,966 --> 00:22:37,000
THE MOVIE "TEN" CAME OUT.

920
00:22:37,066 --> 00:22:37,966
AND THEREFORE, THERE WAS NO

921
00:22:38,033 --> 00:22:38,666
LEGAL BASIS FOR SAYING IT WAS

922
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:39,400
CULTURAL HERITAGE BECAUSE

923
00:22:39,466 --> 00:22:40,133
SHE WAS DOING SOMETHING THAT

924
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,033
ESSENTIALLY WAS IMITATING HOW

925
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,566
BO DEREK STYLED HER HAIR.

926
00:22:43,633 --> 00:22:44,400
YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

927
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:45,100
AMONG THE REASONS HE DISMISSED

928
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,800
HER CASE, THE JUDGE SUGGESTED

929
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,100
THAT A BLACK PERSON WEARING A

930
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:48,700
TRADITIONALLY BLACK HAIRSTYLE

931
00:22:48,766 --> 00:22:50,266
WAS JUST COPYING A WHITE

932
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:51,453
CELEBRITY, WHO STOLE IT FROM

933
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,900
BLACK PEOPLE.

934
00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:55,633
WHICH IS JUST RIDICULOUS!

935
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,066
HAIRSTYLES HAVE CULTURAL ROOTS.

936
00:22:57,133 --> 00:22:58,733
THEY DON'T JUST COME OUT OF

937
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,966
NOWHERE TO SWEEP THE NATION,

938
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:01,800
WITH THE SOLE EXCEPTION OF

939
00:23:01,866 --> 00:23:03,066
"THE RACHEL," WHICH WASN'T

940
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:04,276
APPROPRIATED FROM ANY CULTURE.

941
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,133
IT SIMPLY SPRANG FORTH,

942
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,533
FULLY-FORMED, FROM THE CONCEPT

943
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,466
KNOWN AS "THE '90s."

944
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:10,166
AND I WISH I COULD SAY THAT'S

945
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:11,433
A THING OF THE PAST, BUT YOU

946
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,000
KNOW IT ISN'T.

947
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:14,142
CHASTITY JONES, THE WOMAN YOU

948
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:16,466
SAW EARLIER, SPENT YEARS

949
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:17,666
APPEALING HER CASE, ONLY TO

950
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:19,633
LOSE, IN PART, BECAUSE JUDGES

951
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,533
INTERPRETED CIVIL RIGHTS LAW

952
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,766
TO PROTECT AGAINST

953
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:22,842
DISCRIMINATION BASED ONLY ON

954
00:23:22,866 --> 00:23:25,566
"IMMUTABLE" OR UNCHANGEABLE

955
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:26,700
CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED

956
00:23:26,766 --> 00:23:28,133
WITH RACE, LIKE SKIN COLOR.

957
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,400
SO FOR DECADES, COURTS HAVE

958
00:23:30,466 --> 00:23:31,700
FOUND THAT HAIRSTYLES, EVEN

959
00:23:31,766 --> 00:23:32,700
THOUGH THEY ARE DEEPLY TIED TO

960
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:33,566
RACIAL IDENTITY, ARE NOT

961
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:35,400
COVERED.

962
00:23:35,466 --> 00:23:38,233
AND ALL OF THAT MEANS THAT A

963
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,666
YOUNGER GENERATION CAN STILL END

964
00:23:39,733 --> 00:23:40,233
UP HAVING TO DEAL WITH THIS

965
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,466
SHIT.

966
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:42,742
19-YEAR-OLD DESTINY THOMPKINS

967
00:23:42,766 --> 00:23:44,866
HAS WORKED AT THIS

968
00:23:44,933 --> 00:23:45,800
BANANA REPUBLIC STORE AT THE

969
00:23:45,866 --> 00:23:47,800
WESTCHESTER MALL IN WHITE PLAINS

970
00:23:47,866 --> 00:23:48,800
FOR JUST ABOUT A MONTH.

971
00:23:48,866 --> 00:23:50,166
SHE WAS CALLED INTO A MEETING

972
00:23:50,233 --> 00:23:51,566
WITH HER MANAGER ON WEDNESDAY,

973
00:23:51,633 --> 00:23:52,433
CAUGHT COMPLETELY OFF GUARD BY

974
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,100
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT.

975
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,533
HE WAS LIKE, "YEAH, SO, THE

976
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,366
DISTRICT MANAGER CAME IN AND SHE

977
00:23:56,433 --> 00:23:58,933
POINTED OUT YOUR HAIR."

978
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,533
AND I'M LIKE, "OKAY, SO WHAT'S

979
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,933
WRONG WITH MY HAIR?"

980
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,080
HE SAID, "IT'S A LITTLE TOO

981
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:05,066
URBAN AND UNKEMPT FOR OUR LOOK

982
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:07,200
AND FOR OUR IMAGE.

983
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:07,866
WE WERE JUST WONDERING, LIKE, IF

984
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:12,766
YOU COULD JUST TAKE THEM OUT."

985
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:14,900
OKAY, PUTTING ASIDE THE

986
00:24:14,966 --> 00:24:16,733
USE OF THE WORD "URBAN"... A

987
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,900
LEVEL OF TONE-DEAFNESS ON PAR

988
00:24:18,966 --> 00:24:21,000
WITH NAMING YOUR STORE "BANANA

989
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:21,866
REPUBLIC "..." JUST TAKE THEM

990
00:24:21,933 --> 00:24:22,333
OUT?"

991
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,409
THOSE ARE WORDS FROM SOMEONE WHO

992
00:24:23,433 --> 00:24:24,333
HAS ZERO IDEA OF WHAT IT TOOK TO

993
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,233
PUT THEM IN IN THE FIRST PLACE.

994
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,466
THAT'S COMING FROM A MAN WHO,

995
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:27,733
I'M GUESSING, HAS NEVER SPENT

996
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,133
SEVEN HOURS IN A SALON CHAIR

997
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,600
WITH AN iPAD FULL OF MOVIES AND

998
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:33,300
A BACKPACK FULL OF SNACKS.

999
00:24:33,366 --> 00:24:35,966
NOW YOU SHOULD KNOW, THE STORE

1000
00:24:36,033 --> 00:24:36,766
CALLED THAT UNACCEPTABLE, AND

1001
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:37,833
THE MANAGER WAS FIRED.

1002
00:24:37,866 --> 00:24:38,666
BUT THE PROBLEM IS, SINCE

1003
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:39,566
PROFESSIONALISM GETS DEFINED BY

1004
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:40,533
WHITE STANDARDS AND

1005
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,666
EXPECTATIONS, BLACK HAIR

1006
00:24:41,733 --> 00:24:43,100
IS MORE LIKELY TO CRASH INTO

1007
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:44,366
THOSE EXPECTATIONS.

1008
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:46,400
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

1009
00:24:46,466 --> 00:24:49,100
WELL, FOR SOME OF THE SMALLER

1010
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:51,966
ISSUES YOU'VE SEEN TONIGHT,

1011
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:52,866
THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES.

1012
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:53,866
SOME CHAIN STORES, INCLUDING

1013
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:54,866
WALMART, HAVE ANNOUNCED THEY'LL

1014
00:24:54,933 --> 00:24:56,000
NO LONGER BE LOCKING UP

1015
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:56,433
BLACK HAIR PRODUCTS.

1016
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,666
WHICH FEELS LIKE THE LEAST THEY

1017
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:01,300
CAN DO, BUT IT IS A START!

1018
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:02,266
A BIGGER CHANGE WOULD BE TO

1019
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,476
PASS LAWS LIKE CROWN ACTS, OR

1020
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,642
"CREATING A RESPECTFUL AND OPEN

1021
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:05,900
WORLD FOR NATURAL HAIR."

1022
00:25:05,966 --> 00:25:07,366
VERSIONS HAVE ALREADY BECOME LAW

1023
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:09,000
IN THESE 11 STATES.

1024
00:25:09,066 --> 00:25:11,200
AND WHILE THE LANGUAGE VARIES,

1025
00:25:11,266 --> 00:25:12,266
GENERALLY, THEY EXPAND

1026
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,433
THE DEFINITION OF RACE IN

1027
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,433
ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAWS TO

1028
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,866
INCLUDE TRAITS HISTORICALLY

1029
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,200
ASSOCIATED WITH RACE, LIKE

1030
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,466
PROTECTIVE HAIRSTYLES, SUCH AS

1031
00:25:19,533 --> 00:25:21,100
BRAIDS, LOCS, AND TWISTS.

1032
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:22,933
UNFORTUNATELY, CROWN ACT BILLS

1033
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,166
HAVE REPEATEDLY MET WITH

1034
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:25,400
REPUBLICAN OPPOSITION.

1035
00:25:25,466 --> 00:25:27,566
IN UTAH, IN ONE RECENT ZOOM

1036
00:25:27,633 --> 00:25:29,133
HEARING ON THEIR BILL, STATE

1037
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,866
SENATOR DERRIN OWENS... WHO

1038
00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:33,213
VOTED AGAINST IT... MADE A POINT

1039
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:34,133
OF FIRST ADDRESSING THE BILL'S

1040
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,033
ADVOCATES LIKE THIS.

1041
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,300
LET ME MAKE A COMMENT,

1042
00:25:37,366 --> 00:25:41,333
YOU PEOPLE ARE BEAUTIFUL.

1043
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,100
I DON'T NORMALLY DO THIS, BUT

1044
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,366
I'M GOING TO SHARE.

1045
00:25:44,433 --> 00:25:45,433
I WAS IN THE STORE

1046
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,266
THE OTHER DAY.

1047
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:49,333
AND, UH, YOU WON'T BE ABLE

1048
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,933
TO SEE THIS PICTURE, BUT THIS

1049
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,800
GENTLEMAN IN FRONT OF ME... A

1050
00:25:52,866 --> 00:25:53,333
BLACK MAN... HAD TWO YOUNG

1051
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,533
CHILDREN AND THEY WERE JUST

1052
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,333
HAVING FUN AROUND, UP AND DOWN

1053
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:58,900
THE AISLE.

1054
00:25:58,966 --> 00:25:59,800
AND I DON'T NORMALLY TAKE

1055
00:25:59,866 --> 00:26:00,666
PICTURES OF CHILDREN,

1056
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:01,300
BUT THEY WERE ADORABLE,

1057
00:26:01,366 --> 00:26:03,133
TWO BLACK CHILDREN.

1058
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,300
BECAUSE THEY WERE JUST THE

1059
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:06,033
CUTEST KIDS IN THE WORLD.

1060
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,966
ONE HAS CORNROWS AND ONE OF THEM

1061
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:08,266
DREADLOCKS.

1062
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,266
I WISH YOU COULD SEE THAT.

1063
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:12,866
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,

1064
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:13,500
YOU EXCEPTIONALLY WEIRD MAN?

1065
00:26:13,566 --> 00:26:15,166
HE STARTED OFF

1066
00:26:15,233 --> 00:26:17,100
THERE BY TELLING A GROUP OF

1067
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:18,833
BLACK WOMEN, "YOU PEOPLE ARE

1068
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,533
BEAUTIFUL," THEN PROCEEDED TO

1069
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,866
SAY, "I DON'T NORMALLY TAKE

1070
00:26:21,933 --> 00:26:23,800
PICTURES OF CHILDREN, BUT"...

1071
00:26:23,866 --> 00:26:25,009
A PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE SENTENCE

1072
00:26:25,033 --> 00:26:25,600
UNTIL THE "BUT" PART.

1073
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:26,876
THEN LAUNCHED INTO A STORY ABOUT

1074
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,733
HOW HE KEEPS PHOTOS OF

1075
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,233
STRANGERS' CHILDREN

1076
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,033
ON HIS PHONE.

1077
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,766
ALL OF WHICH EVOKES A RESPONSE

1078
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:33,500
PERHAPS BEST SUMMED UP BY THIS

1079
00:26:33,566 --> 00:26:34,500
EXPRESSION, WHICH I'D ARGUE IS

1080
00:26:34,566 --> 00:26:36,100
AN ABSOLUTE MASTERCLASS IN HOW

1081
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:37,166
TO SAY "THE FUCK?"

1082
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,933
USING ONLY YOUR EYEBROWS.

1083
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,200
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING HOW HE

1084
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:43,700
GOT FROM THAT TO VOTING AGAINST

1085
00:26:43,766 --> 00:26:45,006
THE BILL, HIS ARGUMENT WAS THAT

1086
00:26:45,033 --> 00:26:46,333
HE FELT EXISTING LAWS WERE

1087
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,000
SUFFICIENT, AND THAT "IT ALMOST

1088
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:49,300
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO DO

1089
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:51,566
SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST."

1090
00:26:51,633 --> 00:26:52,709
BUT THIS DISCRIMINATION ISN'T

1091
00:26:52,733 --> 00:26:54,166
"SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST,"

1092
00:26:54,233 --> 00:26:56,400
IT'S "SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T

1093
00:26:56,425 --> 00:26:57,897
EXIST FOR WHITE MEN WHO'VE NEVER

1094
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:01,450
HAD TO THINK ABOUT IT BEFORE."

1095
00:27:03,075 --> 00:27:04,475
THE CONSEQUENCES OF HAIR-BASED

1096
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,766
DISCRIMINATION ARE VERY REAL.

1097
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,833
JUST LISTEN TO CONNECTICUT STATE

1098
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,976
SENATOR GARY WINFIELD MAKE THE

1099
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,433
CASE FOR HIS STATE'S CROWN ACT,

1100
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,833
IN THE RUN-UP TO IT PASSING INTO

1101
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,000
LAW, BY TALKING ABOUT HIS

1102
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:16,066
THREE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

1103
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:20,300
RIGHT NOW, SHE RUNS THROUGH

1104
00:27:20,366 --> 00:27:22,066
LIFE WITH ALL OF THE ENERGY THAT

1105
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:24,333
SHE HAS, WITH ALL OF THE BEAUTY

1106
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:24,966
THAT SHE HAS WITH HER HAIR

1107
00:27:25,033 --> 00:27:27,233
NATURAL.

1108
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,533
THAT'S WHO SHE IS.

1109
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,900
IT'S NOT JUST WHAT SITS ON TOP

1110
00:27:30,966 --> 00:27:33,512
OF HER HEAD, IT IS WHO SHE IS.

1111
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,533
BUT I WANT HER TO BE ABLE TO

1112
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,100
PARTICIPATE IN THIS WORLD FULLY,

1113
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,800
AND SO EVEN IF SHE RUNS THROUGH

1114
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,333
THIS WORLD WITH HER NATURAL

1115
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,766
HAIR, THERE WILL BE A DISCUSSION

1116
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:43,533
ABOUT WHAT IT IS TO RUN THROUGH

1117
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,400
THIS WORLD WITH HER NATURAL

1118
00:27:44,466 --> 00:27:50,400
HAIR.

1119
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:53,266
AND WHAT SHE WILL HAVE TO LEARN,

1120
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:54,666
WHETHER SHE MAKES THE CHOICE TO

1121
00:27:54,733 --> 00:27:58,500
RUN THROUGH THIS WORLD WITH HER

1122
00:27:58,566 --> 00:28:01,200
NATURAL HAIR OR NOT, IS THAT A

1123
00:28:01,266 --> 00:28:03,166
PART OF HER IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

1124
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:04,666
THAT'S AWFUL.

1125
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:06,366
IT'S INFURIATING THAT

1126
00:28:06,433 --> 00:28:07,800
BLACK CHILDREN HAVE TO ADD

1127
00:28:07,866 --> 00:28:09,566
"HAIR DISCRIMINATION" TO THE

1128
00:28:09,633 --> 00:28:11,033
LONG LIST OF THINGS THEY'RE

1129
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,242
ALREADY FORCED TO THINK ABOUT,

1130
00:28:12,266 --> 00:28:12,966
LIKE THE THREAT OF POLICE

1131
00:28:13,033 --> 00:28:14,133
VIOLENCE, THE DANGER OF

1132
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,266
HARASSMENT BY RACIST

1133
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:16,700
WHITE PEOPLE, AND OF COURSE,

1134
00:28:16,766 --> 00:28:18,333
THE VERY REAL RISK OF GETTING

1135
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,166
PHOTOGRAPHED BY UTAH STATE

1136
00:28:19,233 --> 00:28:20,333
SENATOR DERRIN OWENS

1137
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,366
IN A FUCKING CHECKOUT LINE.

1138
00:28:23,433 --> 00:28:24,766
THAT MAN'S DAUGHTER, AND ALL

1139
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,833
BLACK PEOPLE, SHOULD CLEARLY BE

1140
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,200
ABLE TO MAKE CHOICES ABOUT THEIR

1141
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:29,966
HAIR BASED ON WHAT THEY FEEL

1142
00:28:30,033 --> 00:28:31,566
LIKE DOING WITH IT, RATHER

1143
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:32,533
THAN, "WILL THIS GET ME HARASSED

1144
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,633
OR FIRED?"

1145
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,266
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE

1146
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:35,233
NATURAL HAIR, GREAT!

1147
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,233
YOU WANT TO STRAIGHTEN

1148
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,533
YOUR HAIR, GREAT!

1149
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,000
WHATEVER YOU LIKE!

1150
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:41,100
THE POINT IS, BLACK HAIR

1151
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:41,933
SHOULDN'T BE VIEWED, CORRALLED,

1152
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,100
OR JUDGED BY WHITE PEOPLE'S

1153
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:43,866
COMFORT.

1154
00:28:43,933 --> 00:28:44,833
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T BELONG TO

1155
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,566
WHITE PEOPLE, IT DOESN'T AFFECT

1156
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:47,400
WHITE PEOPLE, AND WHITE PEOPLE

1157
00:28:47,466 --> 00:28:48,586
REALLY DON'T NEED TO HAVE AN

1158
00:28:48,633 --> 00:28:50,300
OPINION ON IT.

1159
00:28:50,366 --> 00:28:51,733
AND OUR LAWS SHOULD REFLECT

1160
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,333
THAT.

1161
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,600
AND I KNOW THERE MAY BE LIMITS

1162
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:55,366
TO WHAT CROWN ACTS CAN

1163
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:56,466
ACCOMPLISH.

1164
00:28:56,533 --> 00:28:58,166
EVEN IF ONE PASSES AT THE

1165
00:28:58,233 --> 00:28:59,700
FEDERAL LEVEL, THERE COULD

1166
00:28:59,766 --> 00:29:01,300
BE CASES WHERE A WHITE JUDGE IS

1167
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:02,566
ASKED TO DECIDE WHETHER

1168
00:29:02,633 --> 00:29:04,166
A SPECIFIC HAIRSTYLE IS

1169
00:29:04,233 --> 00:29:05,800
"ASSOCIATED WITH RACE" AND

1170
00:29:05,866 --> 00:29:09,900
COMPLETELY FUCKS IT UP, BUT

1171
00:29:09,966 --> 00:29:10,833
THEY ARE A START.

1172
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,466
IF YOU'RE NOT

1173
00:29:11,533 --> 00:29:12,833
A BLACK PERSON, IT'S PROBABLY

1174
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,800
EASY TO HEAR THESE STORIES AND

1175
00:29:13,866 --> 00:29:16,000
THINK "WELL, IT'S JUST HAIR,"

1176
00:29:16,066 --> 00:29:17,109
BUT THE THING IS, IT'S NOT.

1177
00:29:17,133 --> 00:29:19,800
IT'S NOT AT ALL.

1178
00:29:19,866 --> 00:29:21,200
BLACK PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING

1179
00:29:21,266 --> 00:29:22,933
HIRED, OR ARE GETTING FIRED...

1180
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,042
BLACK STUDENTS ARE BEING TEASED,

1181
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:26,900
TAUNTED, AND REMOVED FROM SCHOOL

1182
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:28,233
...ALL BECAUSE OF THEIR HAIR.

1183
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,200
AND CROWN ACT LAWS COULD MAKE A

1184
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:32,066
REAL DIFFERENCE THERE.

1185
00:29:32,133 --> 00:29:34,633
AND WHILE SOCIAL STIGMA AND

1186
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,200
UNREALISTIC BEAUTY STANDARDS

1187
00:29:35,266 --> 00:29:35,966
AREN'T GOING TO GO AWAY

1188
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:37,233
OVERNIGHT, THERE ARE A FEW

1189
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,100
THINGS THAT WHITE VIEWERS,

1190
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:40,633
IN PARTICULAR, MIGHT WANT TO

1191
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,466
KEEP IN MIND GOING FORWARD.

1192
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,000
AND TO THAT END,

1193
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:45,933
IF YOU ARE ONE, THERE'S A

1194
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,500
MESSAGE YOU SHOULD PROBABLY

1195
00:29:46,566 --> 00:29:49,066
HEAR.

1196
00:29:49,133 --> 00:29:52,633
HI, WHITE PEOPLE.

1197
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,833
HI, WHITE PEOPLE.

1198
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,566
I'M LESLIE JONES.

1199
00:29:55,633 --> 00:29:58,066
WHAT'S UP, BLACK PEOPLE.

1200
00:29:58,133 --> 00:29:59,633
BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

1201
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,500
YOU GOOD?

1202
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:02,500
YOUR MAMA GOOD?

1203
00:30:02,566 --> 00:30:03,933
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, I GOT TO

1204
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,300
TALK TO THESE WHITE PEOPLE FOR A

1205
00:30:05,366 --> 00:30:05,800
SECOND.

1206
00:30:05,866 --> 00:30:09,066
I SEE YOU AT THE MEETING.

1207
00:30:09,133 --> 00:30:09,633
LOOK, WHITE PEOPLE.

1208
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,633
I KNOW YOU HAVE LOTS OF

1209
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:11,900
QUESTIONS.

1210
00:30:11,966 --> 00:30:14,000
LIKE, MAY BE TOO MANY

1211
00:30:14,066 --> 00:30:14,633
QUESTIONS.

1212
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,833
LIKE, HOW OFTEN DO YOU HAVE

1213
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,566
TO WASH BLACK HAIR?

1214
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:20,266
WHAT IS A SILK PRESS?

1215
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:22,300
WHAT DOES IT DO RAG DO?

1216
00:30:22,366 --> 00:30:24,400
WE ARE ABOUT TO FILL YOU IN.

1217
00:30:24,466 --> 00:30:27,700
WE ARE ABOUT TO GIVE YOU ANSWERS

1218
00:30:27,766 --> 00:30:28,933
TO ALL YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT

1219
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,233
BLACK HAIR.

1220
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,066
ARE YOU READY FOR IT?

1221
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:32,500
ARE YOU READY FOR IT?

1222
00:30:32,566 --> 00:30:34,733
ARE YOU READY FOR IT?

1223
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,166
GOOGLE IT.

1224
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:38,500
GOOGLE IT.

1225
00:30:38,566 --> 00:30:39,966
FUCKING GOOGLE IT.

1226
00:30:40,033 --> 00:30:41,966
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE GOOGLE.

1227
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:46,333
IT CAN BE FUCKING BING.

1228
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,766
THE INFORMATION IS OUT THERE.

1229
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:50,266
ONCE YOU GET THE INFORMATION,

1230
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:50,866
YOU CAN APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY

1231
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,100
AND HARD WORK IT TAKES TO KEEP

1232
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:54,633
MY HAIR LAID AND LOOKING GOOD.

1233
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,800
IF YOU AREN'T INTERESTED IN

1234
00:30:56,866 --> 00:31:00,200
GOOGLING IT, YOU THERE IS

1235
00:31:00,266 --> 00:31:01,100
ANOTHER OPTION.

1236
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:02,233
LEAVE US ALONE.

1237
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,066
FUCKING OFF IS ALWAYS AN

1238
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:04,400
OPTION.

1239
00:31:04,466 --> 00:31:05,766
WHITE PEOPLE, DON'T TELL ME

1240
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:06,433
YOU CAN FIGURE THAT OUT.

1241
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:11,233
YOU FIGURED OUT SETTLERS OF

1242
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:11,433
CATAN.

1243
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,733
YOU FIGURED OUT SOURDOUGH.

1244
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,600
YOU CAN LEARN WHAT A BOX

1245
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:19,466
BRAID IS, BITCH.

1246
00:31:19,533 --> 00:31:21,433
BASICALLY, GOOGLE IT.

1247
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:21,800
DON'T TOUCH IT.

1248
00:31:21,866 --> 00:31:23,300
ONE MORE THING.

1249
00:31:23,366 --> 00:31:25,533
DON'T SPRAY MY WATER AND TAP

1250
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,466
MY HEAD.

1251
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:28,733
I'M NOT A CAT.

1252
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,866
BYE.

1253
00:31:29,933 --> 00:31:31,033
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

1254
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,666
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

1255
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:34,566
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

1256
00:31:34,633 --> 00:31:35,633
GOOD NIGHT.
