1
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,433
HI THERE!

2
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,200
WELCOME TO THE SHOW!

3
00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:29,500
STILL COMING TO YOU FROM THIS

4
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:30,966
BLANK VOID, THE WHITEST THING

5
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:32,109
ON TV THIS WEEK, ASIDE FROM

6
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:33,276
NANCY PELOSI DESPERATELY TRYING

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,476
TO PRETEND SHE KNOWS THE WORDS

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,133
TO "LIFT EVERY VOICE AND SING."

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,433
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,000
JUNETEENTH WAS DECLARED

11
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:40,200
A FEDERAL HOLIDAY,

12
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:41,633
THE SUPREME COURT UPHELD

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,100
OBAMACARE FOR THE 400th TIME,

14
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,700
AND JOE BIDEN HAD A SUMMIT WITH

15
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:46,166
VLADIMIR PUTIN, PROMPTING THIS

16
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:50,900
DO YOU THINK AT

17
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:54,400
THE PRESENT STAGE, WE CAN TALK

18
00:00:54,466 --> 00:00:55,366
ABOUT A NEW STAGE OF BILATERAL

19
00:00:55,433 --> 00:00:58,833
RELATIONS?

20
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,866
THERE IS NO

21
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:02,633
HAPPINESS IN LIFE, THERE IS ONLY

22
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,733
A MIRAGE OF IT ON THE HORIZON.

23
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,733
WOW, THAT'S A DARK

24
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,700
ANSWER.

25
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:08,833
BUT I CAN'T SAY I EXPECTED

26
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,800
ANYTHING LESS FROM A MAN

27
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:11,000
WHOSE FACE SCREAMS,

28
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:12,733
"I ENJOYED THE "JOKER" FILM."

29
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,366
BECAUSE OF COURSE PUTIN DROPPED

30
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:19,466
BLEAK TOLSTOY QUOTES.

31
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:20,033
THAT'S VERY ON BRAND.

32
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,966
IT WOULD'VE BEEN MUCH MORE

33
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:21,866
SHOCKING IF HE'D SAID,

34
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:22,866
"FOLLOW YOUR BLISS," OR

35
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:24,176
"IT'S WINE O'CLOCK SOMEWHERE" OR

36
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:24,833
"NAVALNY, YOU HAVE THE FLOOR."

37
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,600
BUT INSTEAD OF THAT,

38
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:26,566
I WANT TO FOCUS ON JAPAN,

39
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:27,809
THE COUNTRY WHICH GAVE THE WORLD

40
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,009
KARAOKE, THE BEST WAY TO LEARN

41
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:30,042
WHICH OF YOUR COWORKERS IS

42
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:31,000
IRRATIONALLY OVERCONFIDENT

43
00:01:31,066 --> 00:01:32,266
IN THEIR SINGING ABILITIES.

44
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,800
"LOVE ON TOP" BY BEYONCE?

45
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:37,166
THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

46
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:38,100
TOKYO IS SET TO HOST

47
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,033
THE OLYMPICS IN JUST A MONTH.

48
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,633
THEY WERE ORIGINALLY SUPPOSED

49
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,533
TO TAKE PLACE LAST SUMMER, BUT

50
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,800
DIDN'T, DUE TO...

51
00:01:45,866 --> 00:01:47,000
Y'KNOW.

52
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,000
AND YET, DESPITE THE FACT THAT

53
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,176
THE PANDEMIC IS STILL VERY MUCH

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,600
NOT OVER, THE GAMES SEEM TO BE

55
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:51,566
GOING AHEAD, AND NOT EVERYONE

56
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:53,900
IN JAPAN IS THRILLED.

57
00:01:53,966 --> 00:01:55,500
TONIGHT, TOKYO OLYMPIC

58
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:58,033
ORGANIZERS SAY THE GAMES ARE

59
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,176
A GO, WITH MUSIC, MEDAL TRAYS,

60
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,233
AND UNIFORMS.

61
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,733
THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE

62
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,666
GAMES GOING ON IS 100%.

63
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:08,433
BUT POPULAR PROTESTS DEMAND

64
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,600
THEY BE STOPPED,

65
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:10,866
WITH SHIGARU OMI,

66
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:12,700
JAPAN'S VERISON OF

67
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:13,766
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, SAYING

68
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,200
THE SITUATION IS NOT NORMAL.

69
00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:18,500
A DAILY DEATH RATE HIGHER THAN

70
00:02:18,566 --> 00:02:19,333
WHEN THE GAMES WERE DELAYED

71
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,866
LAST YEAR.

72
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:22,800
A SLOW VACCINE ROLLOUT.

73
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:25,100
NOW WITH HALF A MILLION SHOTS

74
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,366
EACH DAY, BUT THE TRUE TARGET

75
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:28,166
TWICE THAT.

76
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:29,400
YEAH, THAT'S NOT GOOD!

77
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:31,766
IN FACT, ONLY 6% OF THE JAPANESE

78
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:32,942
POPULATION IS CURRENTLY FULLY

79
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,566
VACCINATED.

80
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:36,200
AND WHILE I DON'T KNOW WHAT

81
00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:37,600
THE TARGET PERCENTAGE SHOULD BE

82
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:38,676
TO SAFELY HOST THE OLYMPICS,

83
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,033
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT RIGHT NOW,

84
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:40,900
IT SHOULD BE HIGHER THAN

85
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:42,100
THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES IN THE

86
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,766
"FAST AND FURIOUS" FRANCHISE.

87
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:44,909
SO IT'S FRANKLY NO WONDER THAT

88
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:46,400
POLLS HAVE SHOWN MANY OF

89
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,866
THE JAPANESE PUBLIC OPPOSE

90
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:49,566
HOLDING THE GAMES THIS YEAR.

91
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:51,866
AND PERHAPS NO ONE REPRESENTS

92
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:53,173
THAT SENTIMENT BETTER THAN THIS

93
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:56,966
ALTHOUGH HOSPITALS ARE CLOSE

94
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:58,333
TO COLLAPSE AND PEOPLE ARE

95
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,900
EXPOSED TO RISK, IOC SAID THEY

96
00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:00,700
WILL, FOR SURE, HOLD THE

97
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:01,400
OLYMPICS!

98
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:02,800
IT'S CRAZY, ISN'T IT?

99
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:04,933
THE IOC SAID, "TOKYO OLYMPICS

100
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,466
WOULD GO AHEAD UNLESS STRUCK BY

101
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:08,100
ARMAGEDDON."

102
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:08,766
HMM.

103
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,000
WHAT A JOKE!

104
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:11,466
HA, HA, HA.

105
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:12,733
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SIT DOWN

106
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,833
AND LISTEN TO AEROSMITH.

107
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,633
THAT IS EXCELLENT.

108
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,133
JUST TENS ACROSS THE BOARD.

109
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,633
TEN.

110
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,733
PLUGGING HIS EARS INSTEAD

111
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,233
TEN.

112
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,400
SHOUTING AN AEROSMITH LYRIC

113
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:26,233
BEFORE HIS BODY IS CONSUMED

114
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,366
BY A VERY SHALLOW LAGOON:

115
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:29,233
TEN AGAIN.

116
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,833
IF THE OLYMPICS SIMPLY HAVE TO

117
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,133
HAPPEN, I WANT THAT GUY TO BE

118
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,800
THE ENTIRE OPENING CEREMONY.

119
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:35,866
JUST HIM, ALONE IN A STADIUM,

120
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:37,466
SCREAMING AEROSMITH JOKES WHILE

121
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:38,676
OCCASIONALLY JUMPING INTO WATER,

122
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,566
FOR FOUR SOLID HOURS.

123
00:03:40,633 --> 00:03:42,933
I'D WATCH EVERY SECOND OF THAT.

124
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,466
THE OLYMPICS GOING AHEAD IS

125
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:45,433
UNDENIABLY RISKY, BUT THE

126
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,766
ORGANIZERS SEEM TO BE

127
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,166
CONSIDERING A LOT OF DIFFERENT

128
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:49,333
FACTORS, WITH MANY BEING

129
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,576
FINANCIAL, ESPECIALLY AS JAPAN'S

130
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,500
ALREADY OFFICIALLY SPENT OVER

131
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,633
$15 BILLION ON THESE GAMES,

132
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,400
WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITS

133
00:03:57,466 --> 00:03:58,266
SUGGESTING IT'S ACTUALLY

134
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,600
TWICE THAT MUCH.

135
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:00,500
AND THE TRUTH IS,

136
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:01,433
EVEN IF JAPAN WANTED TO CANCEL,

137
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,700
IT'S NOT QUITE THAT SIMPLE.

138
00:04:03,766 --> 00:04:05,000
THE OLYMPIC HOST CITY

139
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:06,866
CONTRACT SIGNED BETWEEN TOKYO

140
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:09,233
AND THE IOC IN 2013 DOESN'T GIVE

141
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,866
TOKYO THE POWER TO SCRAP THE

142
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:12,433
GAMES.

143
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,566
ONLY THE IOC HOLDS THAT RIGHT.

144
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:16,133
YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

145
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,309
JAPAN DOESN'T TECHNICALLY HAVE

146
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,533
THE AUTHORITY TO CANCEL THE

147
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,933
GAMES, WHICH IS KIND OF WEIRD.

148
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,300
IT WOULD BE LIKE IF YOUR CHILD

149
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:23,900
GOT THE FLU AND YOU TRIED TO

150
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:25,600
RESCHEDULE THEIR BIRTHDAY PARTY,

151
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:26,500
ONLY TO GET OVERRULED BY THE

152
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:27,400
CLOWN YOU HIRED.

153
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:28,700
"HEY!

154
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:29,933
I DON'T CARE IF YOU'VE GOT

155
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,200
THE BUBONIC FUCKING PLAGUE,

156
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:33,066
FROM 2:00 PM TO 5:00, YOU'RE ON

157
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:35,066
BOZO'S CLOCK, BITCH."

158
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:36,866
TO PROMOTE SAFETY AT THE GAMES,

159
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:37,976
A TON OF PRECAUTIONS ARE BEING

160
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,300
UNVEILED, FROM BARRING

161
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:40,500
SPECTATORS FROM ABROAD,

162
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:41,676
TO ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO KEEP A

163
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,033
TWO-METER DISTANCE AT ALL TIMES,

164
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,500
TO REQUESTING ATTENDEES SUPPORT

165
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:48,766
ATHLETES BY CLAPPING INSTEAD OF

166
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,233
SINGING OR CHANTING, WHICH IS A

167
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,766
SHAME BECAUSE... AS ANYONE WILL

168
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,876
TELL YOU... HALF THE FUN OF

169
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,433
WATCHING THE MEN'S TRAMPOLINE

170
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,766
FINAL IS THE RAUCOUS BONDING

171
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,233
WITH YOUR FELLOW TRAMP-HEADS.

172
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,266
AND WHILE SOME OF THOSE

173
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,500
PRECAUTIONS WILL HOPEFULLY DO

174
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,200
SOME GOOD, I WILL SAY, OTHERS

175
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:04,500
HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CHANCE.

176
00:05:04,566 --> 00:05:05,833
OLYMPIC ORGANIZERS TYPICALLY

177
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,600
GIVE AWAY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

178
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:08,266
CONDOMS DURING THE GAMES FOR ALL

179
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,966
THE ATHLETES.

180
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:12,366
BUT THIS YEAR THERE IS STILL

181
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:14,066
GOING TO BE A CONDOM GIVEAWAY,

182
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:15,166
BUT THEY ARE TELLING THE

183
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:15,900
ATHLETES NOT TO USE THEM UNTIL

184
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:17,933
THEY GET HOME.

185
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,700
WELL, GOOD LUCK WITH

186
00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:19,833
THAT!

187
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,976
HAVE FUN SELLING THAT MESSAGE

188
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,533
AT THE THE CONDOM BOOTH.

189
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,966
"HI THERE, 20-YEAR-OLD ADONIS

190
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:24,533
WITH THE PHYSICAL STAMINA OF

191
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,500
A YOUNG GAZELLE.

192
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:27,066
WELCOME TO WHAT IS, ESSENTIALLY,

193
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:28,309
A LIGHTLY MONITORED DORM FLOOR

194
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,476
THAT YOU'LL BE SHARING WITH SOME

195
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,966
OF THE MOST CHISELED BODIES ON

196
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:31,766
THE PLANET, ALL OF WHOM YOU'LL

197
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:32,700
LIKELY NEVER SEE AGAIN.

198
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,533
HERE ARE SOME FREE CONDOMS!

199
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,766
BUT PLEASE, MAKE SURE YOU THAT

200
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:37,666
YOU SAVE THEM UNTIL... AH, I SEE

201
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:40,000
YOU'RE ALREADY FUCKING.

202
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:40,866
WELL, PLEASE, AT LEAST MOVE TO

203
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:41,833
THE SIDE, THERE IS A LINE BEHIND

204
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,033
YOU."

205
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,500
BUT I GUESS IT'S GOOD NEWS THAT

206
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:46,133
THEY'RE STILL HANDING THEM OUT,

207
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,466
ESPECIALLY FOR JAPAN'S TOP

208
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:49,000
CONDOM-MAKERS, WHO APPARENTLY

209
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:50,209
SAW THE OLYMPICS AS AN EXTREMELY

210
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:51,933
PRECIOUS OPPORTUNITY TO LET

211
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,042
THE WORLD KNOW ABOUT JAPAN'S

212
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:55,333
HIGH TECHNOLOGY PROPHYLACTICS.

213
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,766
ALTHOUGH, I WILL SAY,

214
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:57,566
I'M NOT CONVINCED THEY NEEDED

215
00:05:57,633 --> 00:05:59,766
THE OLYMPICS TO DO THAT.

216
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:00,876
BECAUSE JAPANESE CONDOM ADS

217
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,009
DO A PRETTY GOOD JOB SELLING

218
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:03,800
THEIR PRODUCT.

219
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:07,100
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

220
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,442
THE CONDOM GORO FOUND WAS ONE

221
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:09,800
OF LEGEND.

222
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:10,866
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

223
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:11,866
HOLY MOLY!

224
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:12,942
GORO BECOMES A CONDOM BATTLER

225
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:14,033
AGAINST HIS WILL.

226
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,733
OMG!

227
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,733
A CONDOM HUNTER!

228
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
HA, HA!

229
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:17,533
DOUBLING UP GAVE ME ULTIMATE

230
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
ENDURANCE!

231
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:19,700
I CAN LAST 13 HOURS!!!

232
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:21,333
NO WAY!

233
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,733
WATCH OUT!

234
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,600
RUN, GORO!

235
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,766
LOOK, HIS CONDOM RIPPED!

236
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,333
WHOO-HOO!

237
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,466
DON'T DOUBLE-BAG CONDOMS!

238
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:30,733
THAT WAS CLOSE.

239
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,933
GORO BEGINS HIS JOURNEY TO

240
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,933
BECOME A CONDOM BATTLER,

241
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,533
COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF

242
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,300
THE CHALLENGES AHEAD.

243
00:06:38,366 --> 00:06:39,933
YES!

244
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,033
THAT WAS PART OF AN ANIME

245
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,100
WEB SERIES PRODUCED BY JAPAN'S

246
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,176
LEADING CONDOM MANUFACTURER,

247
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,466
OKAMOTO, IN WHICH A

248
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:46,933
"CONDOM BATTLER" NAMED GORO

249
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,700
FINDS A MAGICAL RUBBER ON

250
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:50,533
THE GROUND, WHICH TURNS INTO

251
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,166
A SUIT OF PROTECTIVE ARMOR THAT

252
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:52,100
HE WEARS WHILE BATTLING A BUNCH

253
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,233
OF ANIME VILLAINS.

254
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,733
SO YOU KNOW, JUST YOUR AVERAGE

255
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,033
EDUCATIONAL,

256
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,400
CONTRACEPTION-THEMED, SCI-FI,

257
00:06:57,466 --> 00:06:58,966
ACTION CARTOON AD FOR JAPANESE

258
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:00,209
COCK SOCKS ABOUT AN ANIME WAR IN

259
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:01,500
WHICH THE DRESS CODE APPEARS TO

260
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:02,742
BE "LATEX CASUAL," ALL OF WHICH

261
00:07:02,766 --> 00:07:04,333
THEY CLAIM IS "TO BE CONTINUED"

262
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,442
...OR, AS THE AD SAYS, "TO BE

263
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,200
CONDOM."

264
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:09,466
THAT'S SO MUCH MORE FUN THAN

265
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:11,266
SEX-ED IS HERE IN THE U.S.,

266
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,766
WHERE IT'S USUALLY, "HERE'S A

267
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:13,876
CONDOM, HERE'S A BANANA, LET'S

268
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,933
NEVER SPEAK OF THIS AGAIN."

269
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,200
BUT THE FACT IS, DESPITE

270
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:20,033
PROTESTS, IT SEEMS LIKE

271
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,500
THE OLYMPICS ARE GOING AHEAD.

272
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,666
AND ALL OF THIS IS A GOOD

273
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:23,900
REMINDER THAT HOSTING THE

274
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:24,633
OLYMPICS IS JUST NEVER

275
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,233
A GOOD IDEA FOR A CITY.

276
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,342
AND IT'S NOT LIKE JAPAN NEEDS

277
00:07:27,366 --> 00:07:28,766
THE OLYMPICS TO BOOST TOURISM.

278
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,466
IT'S JAPAN!

279
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,366
IT'S ALREADY GOT MOUNT FUJI,

280
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:34,333
BAMBOO FORESTS, AND THE WORLD'S

281
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,966
WETTEST COMEDIAN.

282
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:37,866
WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO VISIT?

283
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:39,033
AND WHILE I TRULY HOPE FOR

284
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,366
EVERYONE'S BENEFIT THAT THIS

285
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:42,566
WORKS OUT, YOU CAN'T HELP

286
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:43,709
FEELING THAT THAT MAIN MOTIVATOR

287
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:44,266
IN THIS EVENT TAKING PLACE IS

288
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,900
MONEY.

289
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,166
SO WILL IT BE WORTH IT?

290
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,266
WELL, I GUESS ALL WE CAN REALLY

291
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,409
SAY AT THIS POINT IS... TO QUOTE

292
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:51,600
MY NEW FAVORITE WEB SERIES...

293
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,166
THAT IS VERY MUCH

294
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:54,633
"TO BE CONDOM."

295
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,700
AND NOW, THIS.

296
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,965
AND NOW...

297
00:07:58,066 --> 00:07:58,966

RAISE AND
RAISENETTE.

DRAMA.

304
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,970
GOOD CARL.

305
00:08:16,627 --> 00:08:17,844
BAD CARL.

306
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:20,466
CLAIMED HE WITNESSED A

307
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,119
HIGH-RANKING CIA OFFICER MEET

SEPTEMBER OF 1963.

AND JENNIFER ANISTON.

314
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,366
MOVING ON.

315
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:47,509
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

316
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:48,133
HOME RENOVATIONS.

317
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,066
THEY'RE A BIG COMMITMENT THAT

318
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:50,209
ALWAYS TURN OUT GREAT, UNLESS,

319
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:50,933
THAT IS, YOU'RE ON

320
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,833
"TRADING SPACES," IN WHICH CASE,

321
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,433
THEY CAN TURN OUT LIKE THIS:

322
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,433
WE ARE IN THE ROOM.

323
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,100
OPEN YOUR EYES AND SEE YOUR NEW

324
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,866
FAMILY ROOM.

325
00:08:57,933 --> 00:09:03,066
WOW.

326
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:03,933
I'M GONNA HAVE TO LEAVE THE

327
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,133
ROOM NOW.

328
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,600
YOU'RE THAT DISAPPOINTED?

329
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,900
WELL...

330
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,242
I'M GONNA HAVE TO LEAVE THE ROOM

331
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:12,100
NOW.

332
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:12,466
WOW.

333
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:14,766
THAT'S A SHAME.

334
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:15,953
KUDOS TO PAM THERE FOR BEING

335
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,009
GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO STEP OUT.

336
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:18,400
SHE'S SHOWING A LEVEL OF

337
00:09:18,466 --> 00:09:20,600
RESTRAINT THAT THOSE DESIGNERS

338
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:21,300
VERY MUCH DID NOT.

339
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,442
BECAUSE WHY IS THAT FIREPLACE

340
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:24,033
OPAQUE?

341
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,900
WHO WOULD LOOK AT A SEXY

342
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:26,966
FLICKERING FIRE AND SAY,

343
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,833
"GREAT, BUT WHAT IF IT WAS

344
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,666
BLURRY?"

345
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:29,400
ALSO, THAT'S JUST TOO MANY

346
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:30,933
CANDLESTICKS.

347
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,833
THE WHOLE ROOM'S A WINDOWLESS

348
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,233
INFERNO WAITING TO HAPPEN.

349
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,476
IT'S DERANGED, IT'S UNSAFE, AND

350
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,666
FRANKLY, PAM DESERVED BETTER.

351
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:39,266
BUT SPECIFICALLY, WE'RE GOING

352
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,900
TO TALK ABOUT A WAY TO FINANCE

353
00:09:40,966 --> 00:09:43,066
HOME IMPROVEMENTS CALLED PACE.

354
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:44,833
IT WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO

355
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,133
PROVIDE LOW-INCOME HOMEOWNERS

356
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,433
A WAY TO MAKE THEIR HOMES MORE

357
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,233
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY.

358
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,466
AND TO EXPLAIN MORE,

359
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:55,741
HERE IS NETFLIX'S VERY OWN,

360
00:09:57,249 --> 00:09:58,016
WE'RE MAKING IT EASIER FOR

361
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,141
AMERICAN HOMEOWNERS TO TAKE

362
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,033
ADVANTAGE OF A NEW PROGRAM

363
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,133
CALLED PACE.

364
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,900
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

365
00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:06,664
IF YOU MAKE THE SWITCH TO SOLAR,

366
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,400
YOU CAN NOW INSTALL SOLAR PANELS

367
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:10,833
OR RETROFIT YOUR HOME TO MAKE IT

368
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,333
MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT AT NO

369
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,000
UPFRONT COST, ALL BY PAYING FOR

370
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:16,176
THEM THROUGH THE FUTURE SAVINGS

371
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,700
ON YOUR ENERGY BILLS.

372
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:19,733
WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE

373
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,500
A GREAT PROGRAM FOR HOMEOWNERS!

374
00:10:21,566 --> 00:10:23,066
BY THE WAY, IF YOU'RE UNDER THE

375
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:25,766
AGE OF 35, LET ME QUICKLY CLEAR

376
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,266
UP YOUR CONFUSION HERE:

377
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:26,966
A "HOMEOWNER" IS A PERSON WHO

378
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:28,266
OWNS THEIR HOME.

379
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,366
THEY DON'T RENT IT.

380
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:31,133
THE HOUSE BELONGS TO THEM.

381
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,766
LIKE YOUR PARENTS... YOU KNOW

382
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:32,566
HOW YOUR PARENTS LIVE

383
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:33,466
IN A HOUSE, BUT THEY DON'T

384
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:34,166
HAVE A LANDLORD?

385
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,066
AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO SIGN

386
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:35,800
A LEASE, AND THEY DON'T PAY

387
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:36,566
A SECURITY DEPOSIT?

388
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:37,433
IT'S LIKE THAT.

389
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,933
IT'S THEIR HOUSE.

390
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,233
DON'T WORRY, THOUGH... THAT'LL

391
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,100
NEVER BE YOU.

392
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,666
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT.

393
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:43,876
AMERICA DECIDED A FEW YEARS BACK

394
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,066
THAT IF YOU WERE BORN AFTER

395
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:46,400
1985, YOU DON'T GET TO OWN A

396
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:47,833
HOUSE.

397
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,100
YOU DO GET TO RENT APARTMENTS

398
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,233
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE,

399
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,200
THOUGH, AS YOU GRADUALLY PAY OFF

400
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:52,800
THE STUDENT LOANS FROM YOUR

401
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:54,066
LIBERAL ARTS DEGREE... THAT'S

402
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:55,966
THE THING YOU GET TO DO.

403
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:57,109
SO IF YOU'RE UNDER 35, YOU CAN

404
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:58,400
ACTUALLY SKIP THIS STORY.

405
00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:00,166
DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT.

406
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:01,533
GO FIGHT WITH A 15-YEAR-OLD ON

407
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,166
TIKTOK ABOUT THE COOLEST WAY TO

408
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:03,866
PART YOUR HAIR.

409
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:05,033
YOUR LIFE IS SAD,

410
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,030
AND THAT'S OKAY.

411
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,866
PACE, THOUGH, STANDS FOR

412
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:10,800
"PROPERTY ASSESSED

413
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:11,900
CLEAN ENERGY,"

414
00:11:11,966 --> 00:11:13,266
AND THE IDEA ORIGINATED IN

415
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,191
CALIFORNIA AS THE BRAINCHILD OF

416
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:17,833
THE FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO THE

417
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,200
MAYOR OF BERKELEY WHO DESCRIBES

418
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:20,833
HIMSELF AS AN "CAPITALIST

419
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,233
HIPPIE."

420
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,066
WHICH ABSOLUTELY TRACKS FOR

421
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:22,900
A GUY WHOSE NAME SOUNDS LIKE

422
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:23,833
HE'S ABOUT TO GENTRIFY JAZZ.

423
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,733
THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO PACE

424
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,600
ONE FOR COMMERCIAL

425
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,233
PROPERTIES AND ONE FOR

426
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:27,966
RESIDENTIAL ONES.

427
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:29,633
AND WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE

428
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,976
SECOND ONE, WHERE THERE ARE SOME

429
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,600
HUGE PROBLEMS.

430
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,300
BECAUSE AFTER A TRIAL RUN IN

431
00:11:34,366 --> 00:11:35,542
BERKELEY, THE RESIDENTIAL PACE

432
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:36,833
PROGRAM EXPLODED ACROSS

433
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,233
CALIFORNIA.

434
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,066
IN JUST THE SECOND HALF OF 2014,

435
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,242
LENDERS ISSUED $148 MILLION IN

436
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:44,333
PACE LOANS.

437
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,600
AND JUST A YEAR LATER, AS MORE

438
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,842
COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE SIGNED

439
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:48,300
ON, THAT NUMBER QUADRUPLED TO

440
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:50,300
OVER HALF A BILLION DOLLARS.

441
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:52,900
RIGHT NOW, THESE THREE STATES

442
00:11:52,966 --> 00:11:54,633
HAVE ACTIVE PACE PROGRAMS, BUT

443
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,942
PLANS TO EXPAND TO OTHER STATES,

444
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,600
INCLUDING NEW YORK AND OHIO,

445
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,133
ARE VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT.

446
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,500
AND THAT SHOULD BE A CAUSE FOR

447
00:12:02,566 --> 00:12:04,466
REAL CONCERN, BECAUSE WHEN PACE

448
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:05,642
LOANS GO WRONG, THEY CAN GO VERY

449
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,033
WRONG.

450
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,633
TAKE THIS CALIFORNIA COUPLE

451
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,333
WHO ENDED UP LOSING THEIR HOME.

452
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,666
AND THEY SAY THEIR PROBLEMS

453
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:13,466
STARTED WHEN A CONTRACTOR TURNED

454
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,033
UP AT THEIR HOUSE, PITCHING A

455
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,333
PACE-FUNDED IMPROVEMENT.

456
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,442
THEIR HOUSE BADLY NEEDED A

457
00:12:18,466 --> 00:12:19,866
NEW ROOF, SO THEY SIGNED UP.

458
00:12:19,933 --> 00:12:21,766
I THOUGHT IT WAS A WONDERFUL

459
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,233
THING, JUST REALLY A GODSEND.

460
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,342
ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER...

461
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:27,300
ONCE HE SAW THE ROOF,

462
00:12:27,366 --> 00:12:28,606
HE SAYS, "WELL, LOOKS LIKE THIS

463
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:28,900
WALL..."

464
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:30,000
THEN IT WAS THE FLOOR.

465
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:30,900
WELL, I THINK THERE'S SOME

466
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:33,700
DAMAGE THERE.

467
00:12:34,244 --> 00:12:36,251
THEN A FEW MONTHS LATER...

468
00:12:36,276 --> 00:12:37,924
JUMPED OUR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS

469
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:38,883
$600 A MONTH.

470
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:40,308
OUR LIFE BEGAN TO UNRAVEL

471
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,700
AT THAT VERY MOMENT.

472
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:42,300
MY THOUGHT IS THAT WE'RE GOING

473
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:43,700
TO WIND UP IN A TENT.

474
00:12:43,766 --> 00:12:44,600
LOOK, THERE ARE SOME

475
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,133
SITUATIONS WHERE THE IDEA OF

476
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,133
ENDING UP IN A TENT IS EXCITING

477
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,666
...IF YOU'RE GOING CAMPING,

478
00:12:49,733 --> 00:12:50,266
FOR EXAMPLE, OR SEEING

479
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,700
THE CIRCUS, OR WALKING INTO

480
00:12:51,766 --> 00:12:53,033
THE FOREST TO FINALLY ABANDON

481
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,566
SOCIETY FOREVER AND LIVE AMONG

482
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:55,900
THE TREES, BUT IT SHOULDN'T

483
00:12:55,966 --> 00:12:57,009
REALLY BE THE DESIRED OUTCOME

484
00:12:57,033 --> 00:12:58,266
WHEN YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO FIX

485
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,666
YOUR ROOF.

486
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:02,866
UNFORTUNATELY, THE STORY OF PACE

487
00:13:02,933 --> 00:13:05,400
IS A CAUTIONARY TALE ABOUT HOW

488
00:13:05,466 --> 00:13:07,166
GOOD INTENTIONS, WHEN NOT PAIRED

489
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:08,242
WITH CAREFUL, SMART DESIGN,

490
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:10,300
CAN END IN DISASTER.

491
00:13:10,366 --> 00:13:11,600
AND GIVEN THAT JOE BIDEN

492
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,566
PROMOTED THE PROGRAM AS

493
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:14,100
VICE-PRESIDENT, AND PROMISED

494
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,566
ON HIS CAMPAIGN WEBSITE TO

495
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:16,833
"EXPAND THE UTILIZATION OF

496
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:22,333
PACE," IT SEEMED THAT TONIGHT,

497
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,966
IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO TAKE

498
00:13:24,033 --> 00:13:24,733
A LOOK AT IT.

499
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,733
AND LET'S START WITH HOW PACE

500
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,633
WORKS.

501
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,860
BECAUSE BASICALLY, IT'S MONEY

502
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,366
DESIGNATED FOR REPAIRS OR

503
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:28,933
UPGRADES TO YOUR HOUSE.

504
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,600
THE AVERAGE PACE LOAN IS ABOUT

505
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,700
$25,000, AND REPAYMENT PERIODS

506
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:33,909
USUALLY STRETCH BETWEEN FIVE AND

507
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:35,666
25 YEARS.

508
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:38,766
BUT THE WAY YOU PAY IT BACK IS

509
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,700
BOTH UNUSUAL AND VERY

510
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:43,266
COMPLICATED... EVEN THOUGH I'VE

511
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,700
ALREADY CALLED IT A "LOAN," IT'S

512
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:46,133
TECHNICALLY A LIEN ON YOUR HOUSE

513
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,766
...A KIND OF DEBT DIRECTLY

514
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:48,873
ATTACHED TO YOUR PROPERTY,

515
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,166
AND WHICH, IN THIS INSTANCE,

516
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:51,433
YOU GRADUALLY PAY BACK THROUGH

517
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,566
YOUR PROPERTY TAXES.

518
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:54,642
AND ADS PROMOTING PACE HAVE

519
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:55,566
LIKED TO PUT THAT FACT FRONT AND

520
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:58,400
CENTER.

521
00:13:58,466 --> 00:13:59,966
YOUR HOUSE IS ACTUALLY

522
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:01,109
BORROWING THE MONEY AND NOT YOU

523
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:02,166
PERSONALLY.

524
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:04,466
IT'S MORE LIKE THE HOUSE IS

525
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:05,800
GETTING THE FINANCING BECAUSE

526
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:06,533
PAYMENTS ARE MADE THROUGH AN

527
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,233
ASSESSMENT ON YOUR PROPERTY

528
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,600
TAXES.

529
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:09,666
IT'S AS IF YOUR HOUSE

530
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,566
IS BORROWING THE MONEY,

531
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:12,033
NOT YOU PERSONALLY.

532
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,000
OKAY, STOP.

533
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:13,566
BECAUSE THERE'S AN OBVIOUS

534
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:14,700
PROBLEM THERE.

535
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:16,733
EVEN IF YOUR HOUSE IS

536
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,733
TECHNICALLY BORROWING THE MONEY,

537
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,366
THAT MONEY COMES IN THE FORM OF

538
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:20,442
PROPERTY TAXES, AND YOU PAY FOR

539
00:14:20,466 --> 00:14:21,400
THOSE.

540
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:22,800
YOUR HOUSE DOESN'T.

541
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:24,366
BECAUSE HOUSES CAN'T PAY TAXES.

542
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:26,533
BECAUSE HOUSES DON'T HAVE MONEY.

543
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600
BECAUSE THEY'RE HOUSES.

544
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,433
IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF BUYING

545
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,333
A NEW SWEATER AND TELLING THE

546
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,576
CASHIER, "OH, THE SALES TAX IS

547
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,609
ON THE SWEATER, SO THE SWEATER

548
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:35,100
WILL PAY THAT."

549
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,176
THAT'S NOT HOW TAXES OR, INDEED,

550
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,433
SWEATERS WORK.

551
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,900
THOSE ADS ARE FROM PACE

552
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:42,200
ADMINISTRATORS... PRIVATE

553
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:43,466
COMPANIES HIRED BY CITIES TO

554
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:45,233
HANDLE THE LOGISTICS OF THE

555
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,233
PROGRAM, INCLUDING PROVIDING

556
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,333
FINANCING AND APPROVING LOANS.

557
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,133
SOME OF THE BIGGEST PLAYERS ARE

558
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,600
THESE COMPANIES, THE LARGEST OF

559
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,100
WHICH IS CALLED YGRENE.

560
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,000
WHICH IS JUST OBJECTIVELY

561
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:56,166
A STUPID NAME.

562
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:57,966
IT SOUNDS LIKE A CONTEMPLATIVE

563
00:14:58,033 --> 00:14:59,400
JAZZ ALBUM FROM KERMIT THE FROG.

564
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,200
BUT THE REAL ORIGIN OF THE NAME

565
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:03,600
IS SOMEHOW EVEN STUPIDER,

566
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:04,833
AS A YGRENE REPRESENTATIVE

567
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,166
EXPLAINED DURING A LOCAL

568
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:07,366
"SPONSORED CONTENT" SEGMENT:

569
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:08,433
YGRENE, I LOVE THIS.

570
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,366
IT'S EASY TO REMEMBER BECAUSE

571
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:09,966
IT'S ACTUALLY "ENERGY" SPELLED

572
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:10,700
BACKWARDS.

573
00:15:10,766 --> 00:15:12,033
EXACTLY.

574
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,800
MOST PEOPLE DON'T FIGURE THAT

575
00:15:12,866 --> 00:15:13,366
OUT, BUT A COUPLE REMINDERS,

576
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:15,066
THEY USUALLY GET IT.

577
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:16,366
YEAH, OF COURSE THEY

578
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:17,933
GET IT, BECAUSE IT'S NOT A HARD

579
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,766
THING TO GET.

580
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,133
YGRENE BASICALLY PUT ABOUT AS

581
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,400
MUCH EFFORT INTO THEIR NAME AS

582
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:23,100
"TRADING SPACES" PUT INTO PAM'S

583
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,100
FAMILY ROOM.

584
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,066
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FLAWS IN

585
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:29,166
HOW PACE PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED,

586
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:30,900
AND HERE IS ONE OF THE FIRST KEY

587
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:33,000
WHILE COMPANIES LIKE

588
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,600
YGRENE MAY PROMOTE PACE THROUGH

589
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,166
ADS AND SPONCON SEGMENTS,

590
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:38,133
THE MAJORITY OF ACTUAL SALES TO

591
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,533
CUSTOMERS ARE DONE BY INDIVIDUAL

592
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,709
CONTRACTORS WHO'LL BE PERFORMING

593
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,000
THE RENOVATIONS.

594
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:43,833
AND THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS

595
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,266
FOR A MOMENT.

596
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,266
THE PEOPLE WITH THE

597
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,900
RESPONSIBILITY OF PITCHING

598
00:15:47,966 --> 00:15:49,700
A VERY COMPLICATED FINANCIAL

599
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:51,633
PRODUCT... A PSEUDO-LOAN THAT'S

600
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,066
TECHNICALLY A TAX LIEN... ARE

601
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:54,000
CONTRACTORS, WHOSE TRAINING IS

602
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:57,933
NOT IN FINANCE.

603
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,042
NO JUDGMENT, IT'S JUST, PEOPLE

604
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:00,133
ARE TRAINED FOR DIFFERENT

605
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
THINGS.

606
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:02,276
IT'S THE SAME REASON YOU DON'T

607
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,409
ASK A BANKER TO RE-GROUT YOUR

608
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:03,933
BATHROOM TILE.

609
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,066
THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE A MESS.

610
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,373
IN PRACTICE, THE WAY IT USUALLY

611
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,033
WORKS IS, A CONTRACTOR WILL

612
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,333
APPROACH YOU... MAYBE OUTSIDE

613
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,566
A SHOPPING CENTER, OR AT YOUR

614
00:16:11,633 --> 00:16:12,833
CHURCH, OR EVEN KNOCKING

615
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,266
DIRECTLY ON YOUR DOOR.

616
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,433
AND THEY'LL OFFER TO SELL YOU,

617
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,633
LET'S SAY, SOLAR PANELS, OR A

618
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,000
NEW AIR CONDITIONER, WITH THE

619
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:22,800
PROMISE OF NO MONEY DOWN, AND

620
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:24,076
THAT... CRUCIALLY... SHOULD PAY

621
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,000
FOR THEMSELVES THROUGH HUGE

622
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:27,200
FUTURE SAVINGS.

623
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:28,342
THE THING IS, CONTRACTORS ARE

624
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:29,866
NOT ALWAYS COMPLETELY STRAIGHT

625
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:31,300
WITH CUSTOMERS ABOUT JUST HOW

626
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,166
MUCH THEIR PROPERTY TAXES COULD

627
00:16:32,233 --> 00:16:33,466
GO UP.

628
00:16:33,533 --> 00:16:35,000
THEY CAME TO MY HOUSE.

629
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:36,533
THEY SAID THAT I NEEDED THE

630
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,709
SOLAR SYSTEM, THAT IT WAS GONNA

631
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:38,566
DRAMATICALLY REDUCE MY LIGHT

632
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:42,933
BILLS.

633
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,900
WHEN MY PROPERTY TAXES CAME

634
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:45,633
BACK IN NOVEMBER, I HAD...

635
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,866
I WENT FROM $600 PROPERTY TAXES

636
00:16:47,933 --> 00:16:49,900
TO ALMOST $10,000 PROPERTY

637
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:52,500
TAXES, WHICH I COULD NOT PAY.

638
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:54,433
$600 TO $10,000.

639
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,933
THAT IS NOT GOOD!

640
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,633
THE ONLY TIME THE VALUE OF

641
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,466
SOMETHING SHOULD CHANGE THAT

642
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:00,200
DRAMATICALLY IS IF ELON MUSK

643
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:01,633
SHITS OUT A TWEET ABOUT IT.

644
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,533
WE TRULY LIVE IN THE BEST

645
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,833
POSSIBLE SYSTEM!

646
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,166
BUT ALSO, IT SEEMS PRETTY

647
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:08,376
UNLIKELY SOLAR PANELS ARE GOING

648
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,600
TO CUT HER ELECTRICITY BILL BY

649
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:11,866
$10,000.

650
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:13,400
IN FACT, FOR ALL THE TALK ABOUT

651
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,733
HOW PACE IMPROVEMENTS WILL PAY

652
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,600
FOR THEMSELVES, THERE IS A

653
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,500
FUNDAMENTAL FLAW THERE, AS THIS

654
00:17:18,566 --> 00:17:19,642
PROFESSOR WHO'S STUDIED THEM

655
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,033
WILL TELL YOU:

656
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,800
A FOUNDATIONAL FLAW OF THE

657
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:24,400
PACE PROGRAM IS THAT THERE IS

658
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:26,366
NO INDEPENDENT ENERGY AUDIT

659
00:17:26,433 --> 00:17:27,633
REQUIRED OF A HOME BEFORE

660
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,266
HOME CONTRACTORS CAN START

661
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,666
SUGGESTING ALL SORTS OF

662
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:33,400
THINGS TO DO TO IT.

663
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:35,100
SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE MAYBE

664
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,833
PUT IN INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE,

665
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,100
HIGH EFFICIENCY WINDOWS,

666
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:38,933
EVEN THOUGH THE EXISTING WINDOWS

667
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,500
ARE NOT THE MAIN SOURCE OF

668
00:17:39,566 --> 00:17:40,633
ENERGY WASTE.

669
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,866
AND YOU WOULD DO MUCH BETTER

670
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:43,700
JUST CAULKING A FEW LEAKS.

671
00:17:43,766 --> 00:17:46,500
EXACTLY.

672
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:47,366
THERE IS NO INDEPENDENT PARTY

673
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,673
REQUIRED TO ASSESS WHETHER YOUR

674
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,433
RENOVATIONS WOULD CUT CLOSE

675
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,300
TO ENOUGH ENERGY COSTS TO BE

676
00:17:51,366 --> 00:17:52,666
WORTH IT.

677
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:53,633
WHICH REALLY SEEMS LIKE

678
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,742
SOMETHING YOU'D WANT VERIFIED

679
00:17:54,766 --> 00:17:55,900
BY A THIRD PARTY.

680
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:57,300
IT'S THE SAME REASON WE HAVE

681
00:17:57,366 --> 00:17:58,533
INDEPENDENT HEALTH INSPECTORS

682
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,366
PUT A LETTER GRADE OUTSIDE

683
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:01,800
A RESTAURANT, AS OPPOSED TO

684
00:18:01,866 --> 00:18:03,076
LETTING THE OWNER PUT UP HIS OWN

685
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,566
SIGN THAT SAYS, "TRUST ME,

686
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:05,200
IT'S CLEAN."

687
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:07,266
AND THAT ACTUALLY BRINGS US TO

688
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,133
THE NEXT KEY QUIRK OF THE PACE

689
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,566
PROGRAM.

690
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:11,366
BECAUSE IF THOSE ENERGY SAVINGS

691
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:12,800
DON'T COVER THE ADDITIONAL TAXES

692
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:13,700
YOU INCUR, YOU COULD BE IN BIG

693
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:16,566
TROUBLE.

694
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:17,566
REMEMBER THOSE ADS ABOUT HOW

695
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:18,633
"YOUR HOUSE PAYS FOR

696
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:20,500
THE FINANCING, NOT YOU?"

697
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,133
WHAT THAT MEANS IS,

698
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,209
YOUR HOUSE IS NOW THE COLLATERAL

699
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:25,466
FOR THE DEBT.

700
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:26,100
SO IF THINGS GO WRONG,

701
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,400
YOU COULD WELL LOSE YOUR HOME,

702
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:29,166
AND, YOU KNOW, END UP IN A TENT.

703
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,866
AND THERE ARE FAR FEWER

704
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:32,533
PROTECTIONS TO PREVENT THAT THAN

705
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,000
YOU MIGHT THINK.

706
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:35,076
BECAUSE THIS IS A TAX LIEN

707
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,966
RATHER THAN A LOAN,

708
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,966
THE FINANCING ISN'T SUBJECT TO

709
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:39,566
THE SAME CONSUMER PROTECTIONS

710
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:40,833
THAT YOU'D GET WITH A STANDARD

711
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:43,066
HOME LOAN.

712
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:44,466
SO FOR INSTANCE, IN FLORIDA,

713
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:45,766
THE STATE DOESN'T REQUIRE

714
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,033
PACE PROVIDERS TO EXPLAIN

715
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,566
THE COSTS OF IMPROVEMENTS,

716
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:50,400
CHECK IF THE PEOPLE WHO SIGN UP

717
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:52,100
CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD TO PAY BACK

718
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,533
THE MONEY, OR IF THEY EVEN

719
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,100
UNDERSTAND THE TERMS.

720
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,100
AND PACE ADMINISTRATORS WILL

721
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,242
INSIST THEY DO ALL THOSE THINGS

722
00:18:58,266 --> 00:18:59,566
ANYWAY... THAT THEY'RE DILIGENT

723
00:18:59,633 --> 00:19:01,000
ABOUT VETTING HOMEOWNERS,

724
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:02,533
THE PROJECTS THEY TAKE ON,

725
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,433
AND THEIR ABILITY TO REPAY.

726
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,300
BUT THERE ARE SO MANY EXAMPLES

727
00:19:06,366 --> 00:19:08,266
OF FAILURES TO DO THAT.

728
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:12,533
THANKS TO PACE, ONE MISSOURI

729
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,133
HOMEOWNER WOUND UP WITH

730
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,633
$25,000 OF DEBT ON THE HOME THAT

731
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,300
WAS APPRAISED BY THE CITY AT THE

732
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:21,833
TIME ADDRESSED $8400.

733
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,100
AND IF AT THIS POINT YOU'RE

734
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:24,733
WONDERING WHY ON EARTH PEOPLE

735
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,433
SIGN UP FOR THESE LOANS, IT'S

736
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,100
BECAUSE THEY'RE OFTEN PRESENTED

737
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:26,933
AS A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM... ONE

738
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,176
THAT, REMEMBER, PRESIDENT OBAMA

739
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,766
PROMOTED... WHICH MIGHT INSTILL

740
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,100
A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY.

741
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,900
THEY DID MENTION A GOVERNMENT

742
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:37,600
PROGRAM AND THAT'S WHY YOU HEAR

743
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,966
GOVERNMENT, YOU THINK THIS IS AN

744
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:41,766
AWESOME DEAL AND YOU DON'T

745
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:42,842
EXPECT WHAT HAPPENED TO HAPPEN.

746
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:43,866
IN A HIDDEN CAMERA

747
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,700
INVESTIGATION LAST MAY,

748
00:19:45,766 --> 00:19:47,100
WE CAUGHT CONTRACTORS TOUTING

749
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,366
CLAIMS OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS.

750
00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:50,133
SO BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU HAVE

751
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,066
GOING ON, THIS GOVERNMENT

752
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:52,666
PROGRAM COULD ACTUALLY

753
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,333
HELP YOU.

754
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,533
OH, THAT IS A GOVERNMENT

755
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:54,766
PROGRAM.

756
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,333
YEAH.

757
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,033
WHEN WE SHOWED UP,

758
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,233
THE SALES PITCH WAS OVER.

759
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:58,800
AND THEN THEY HAD SOME

760
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:00,733
PARTING WORDS.

761
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,066
YOU SUCK, BY THE WAY.

762
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:06,233
I'D SAY I FELT

763
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,500
BAD FOR THAT REPORTER, WHO WAS

764
00:20:07,566 --> 00:20:08,266
CLEARLY JUST DOING HIS JOB AND

765
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,442
WAS THEN MET WITH A MAN BERATING

766
00:20:09,466 --> 00:20:10,266
HIM FROM HIS COMPACT TOYOTA.

767
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,413
BUT THINK OF IT THIS WAY...

768
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:12,266
AT LEAST NOW HE KNOWS WHAT IT'S

769
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,766
LIKE TO BE A WOMAN ON THE STREET

770
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:14,566
WHO DOESN'T SMILE BACK.

771
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:15,400
AND IF THIS IS ALL STARTING

772
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:16,400
TO FEEL POTENTIALLY PREDATORY,

773
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:17,833
THAT'S BECAUSE IT OFTEN IS.

774
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,100
AND IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

775
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:19,966
THE HISTORY OF PREDATORY

776
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:22,166
LENDING, IT WON'T REMOTELY

777
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:26,133
SURPRISE YOU TO LEARN THAT

778
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,900
AN ANALYSIS OF ONE OF THE

779
00:20:27,966 --> 00:20:29,009
LARGEST MARKETS FOR PACE IN

780
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:30,176
FLORIDA FOUND THAT MANY OF THOSE

781
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,400
WITH THE HIGHEST DEBT BURDENS

782
00:20:31,466 --> 00:20:32,800
UNDER PACE FINANCING WERE FOUND

783
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:33,400
TO BE IN MAJORITY MINORITY

784
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:34,200
ZONES.

785
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,200
AND IT DOESN'T STOP THERE,

786
00:20:35,266 --> 00:20:36,276
BECAUSE CONTRACTORS HAVE ALSO

787
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,100
BEEN ACCUSED OF TARGETING

788
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,242
NEIGHBORHOODS OF NON-ENGLISH

789
00:20:38,266 --> 00:20:39,442
SPEAKERS, SENIOR CITIZENS, AND

790
00:20:39,466 --> 00:20:42,166
EVEN THOSE WITH INTELLECTUAL

791
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:43,509
DISABILITIES, LIKE THIS MAN, WHO

792
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,466
...AS HIS LAWYER POINTS OUT...

793
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:45,800
ABSOLUTELY DID NOT UNDERSTAND

794
00:20:45,866 --> 00:20:48,133
WHAT HE WAS SIGNING UP FOR.

795
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,733
IT'S VERY APPARENT FROM

796
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,300
SPEAKING WITH HIM THAT HE

797
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:54,100
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THESE LOANS.

798
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,833
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE

799
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,366
CONTRACTS THAT HE ENTERED INTO.

800
00:20:57,433 --> 00:20:59,833
HE HAD KITCHEN REMODELING DONE

801
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,500
AND HE DOESN'T EVEN COOK.

802
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:03,366
HE GETS MEALS ON WHEELS.

803
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:04,833
HE DOESN'T USE HIS KITCHEN.

804
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,233
HE'S A NICE GUY, HE WANTS

805
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,133
SOMEONE TO TALK TO.

806
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,533
SO HE INVITES THEM IN, HE TALKS

807
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,000
TO THEM, AND THEY TALK HIM INTO

808
00:21:11,066 --> 00:21:12,300
"HEY, YOU NEED THESE WINDOWS

809
00:21:12,366 --> 00:21:12,566
REPLACED.

810
00:21:12,633 --> 00:21:13,166
YOU NEED YOUR KITCHEN

811
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:14,866
REMODELED."

812
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:16,133
LOOK, I GET THAT YOU'RE

813
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,409
ON HIS SIDE, AND I DO APPRECIATE

814
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:19,300
THAT, BUT YOUR CLIENT IS SITTING

815
00:21:19,366 --> 00:21:20,266
RIGHT THERE!

816
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,376
SOMEONE SHOULD, AT THE VERY

817
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,066
LEAST, HAVE THOUGHT TO MOVE

818
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:24,900
THAT INTERVIEW OUTSIDE.

819
00:21:24,966 --> 00:21:26,200
THE NUMBER ONE RULE OF TALKING

820
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:27,833
ABOUT SOMEONE BEHIND THEIR BACK

821
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,042
IS THAT THEIR BACK SHOULD NOT BE

822
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:29,833
ANYWHERE IN YOUR IMMEDIATE

823
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,200
VICINITY.

824
00:21:32,266 --> 00:21:33,933
AND COMPANIES ROUTINELY DEFEND

825
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,700
THEMSELVES BY ARGUING THEY

826
00:21:35,766 --> 00:21:36,666
DISCLOSE EVERYTHING CLEARLY,

827
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:38,166
AND THAT PEOPLE SIMPLY SHOULDN'T

828
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:38,966
SIGN THESE CONTRACTS IF THEY

829
00:21:39,033 --> 00:21:40,100
CAN'T UNDERSTAND THEM.

830
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,176
BUT THAT'S A LITTLE DISINGENUOUS

831
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,133
WHEN THEIR WHOLE OPERATION SO

832
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,766
OFTEN EMPHASIZES SPEED OVER

833
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,266
SLOW, DELIBERATIVE

834
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,166
CONSIDERATION.

835
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:49,333
THESE COMPANIES' WEBSITES

836
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,409
BRAG ABOUT THEIR "SUPER FAST

837
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:51,766
APPROVALS, " OR THEIR " SPEEDY

838
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,433
APPROVAL PROCESS," OR MAKE

839
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,700
CLAIMS LIKE, "GET APPROVED FOR

840
00:21:55,766 --> 00:21:56,500
YGRENE FINANCING IN 30 MINUTES

841
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:58,100
OR LESS."

842
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,400
AND THE CLEAR IMPLICATION THERE

843
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:01,366
IS THAT YOU CAN BASICALLY GET

844
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:07,466
YOUR MONEY LIKE THAT!

845
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:07,766
OH, SHIT.

846
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:12,100
OH, FOR FUCK'S SAKE.

847
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,200
I'M SORRY, GEORGE.

848
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:14,386
I SNAPPED MY FINGERS WITHOUT

849
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:14,633
THINKING.

850
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,300
YOU KNOW I'M BUSY, RIGHT?

851
00:22:15,366 --> 00:22:16,366
John I DO.

852
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,200
ACTUALLY, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO

853
00:22:17,266 --> 00:22:17,900
RIGHT NOW?

854
00:22:17,966 --> 00:22:18,800
ANYTHING FUN?

855
00:22:18,866 --> 00:22:19,800
FAIR ENOUGH.

856
00:22:19,866 --> 00:22:20,733
THE POINT IS, THOUGH, A COMMON

857
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,700
SALES TACTIC HERE IS FAST

858
00:22:21,766 --> 00:22:22,400
APPROVALS.

859
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,300
CONTRACTORS OFTEN GO

860
00:22:23,366 --> 00:22:24,300
DOOR-TO-DOOR WITH A TABLET,

861
00:22:24,366 --> 00:22:25,233
ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO SIGN

862
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,000
ELECTRONICALLY.

863
00:22:26,066 --> 00:22:27,109
AND IN ONE COMPANY'S VIDEO,

864
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:28,176
A CONTRACTOR TALKS OPENLY ABOUT

865
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,533
JUST HOW FAST THE E-SIGN PROCESS

866
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,600
IS.

867
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,600
I JUST TAKE THE PEOPLE TO

868
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,833
THE ADOPT AND SIGN PORTION OF

869
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,366
IT, HAVE THEM PICK A SIGNATURE,

870
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:38,500
AND SIGN ALL THE REMAINING

871
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:39,266
PAGES, AND WE'RE DONE IN JUST

872
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:40,333
A MATTER OF MINUTES.

873
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,100
I WAS IN A HOUSE IN RIALTO.

874
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:44,309
THE PATIO DOOR WAS OPEN BEHIND

875
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:47,066
ME, THE RAIN WAS POURING,

876
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:49,400
THE TV WAS ON LOUD, THREE DOGS

877
00:22:49,466 --> 00:22:50,706
BARKING, FOUR KIDS YELLING, AND

878
00:22:50,733 --> 00:22:51,733
WE GOT THROUGH IT.

879
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,466
AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE

880
00:22:52,533 --> 00:22:54,366
ESIGN PROGRAM AFTER THAT.

881
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:56,800
OH, I BET YOU DID!

882
00:22:56,866 --> 00:22:57,966
ALTHOUGH, I'M NOT SURE

883
00:22:58,033 --> 00:22:59,233
"LOOK HOW EASY IT WAS TO GET

884
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,309
THIS STRESSED-OUT HOMEOWNER TO

885
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,833
SIGN A LEGALLY BINDING DOCUMENT"

886
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,166
IS QUITE THE FLEX HE THINKS

887
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:04,333
IT IS.

888
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,533
THERE ARE, INDEED, SEVERAL

889
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,266
THINGS YOU CAN DO IN A MATTER OF

890
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:06,900
MINUTES WHILE FOUR CHILDREN

891
00:23:06,966 --> 00:23:07,866
ARE SCREAMING AND THREE DOGS

892
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:09,433
ARE BARKING IN THE BACKGROUND.

893
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,166
YOU CAN SCHEDULE A GROCERY

894
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:12,133
DELIVERY, OR HAVE A TENSE

895
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,376
EYE CONTACT-ONLY ARGUMENT WITH

896
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,133
YOUR SPOUSE, OR LIKE AN

897
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
INSTAGRAM POST FROM

898
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:17,900
AN EX ANNOUNCING THEY'RE

899
00:23:17,966 --> 00:23:19,866
"MAKING MUSIC NOW," THEN FIND

900
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:21,866
THAT EX'S MUSIC ON SOUNDCLOUD,

901
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,733
THEN SEND THAT EX'S NEW SONGS

902
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,733
TO YOUR GROUP THREAD, THEN WATCH

903
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,080
AS THEY MERCILESSLY TEAR TEVIS'S

904
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:28,166
AMATEUR EDM TRACKS A NEW

905
00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:29,666
ASSHOLE.

906
00:23:29,733 --> 00:23:31,733
ALL OF THAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED

907
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,933
UNDER THOSE CHAOTIC

908
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT SIGNING UP

909
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:37,833
FOR A MASSIVE LIEN ON YOUR HOUSE

910
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,533
FROM A GUY WHO'S IN LOVE WITH

911
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,809
HIS iPAD PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE.

912
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,076
BECAUSE THIS ISN'T LIKE AGREEING

913
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,000
TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF

914
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:44,100
AN iTUNES UPDATE.

915
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,700
THIS IS LIKE SITTING ACROSS THE

916
00:23:45,766 --> 00:23:47,200
TABLE FROM A BANKER, POTENTIALLY

917
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:48,800
SIGNING YOUR HOUSE AWAY.

918
00:23:48,866 --> 00:23:51,466
THE PROBLEMS IS THE INCENTIVES

919
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:52,300
JUST AREN'T REALLY THERE FOR

920
00:23:52,366 --> 00:23:54,333
CONTRACTORS TO MAKE SURE THAT

921
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,442
THE PEOPLE THEY'RE SELLING TO

922
00:23:55,466 --> 00:23:56,366
CAN ACTUALLY PAY BACK THE LOANS

923
00:23:56,433 --> 00:23:58,100
THEY'RE TAKING ON.

924
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:59,633
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE, IN THE FINAL

925
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,233
QUIRK OF THIS PROGRAM THAT MAKES

926
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,433
IT SO DANGEROUS, THE PACE LOAN

927
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,333
ISN'T JUST A LIEN ON YOUR HOUSE

928
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,500
...IT'S WHAT'S CALLED A

929
00:24:07,566 --> 00:24:09,033
"PRIORITY LIEN," MEANING THAT,

930
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,566
IN THE EVENT OF A FORECLOSURE,

931
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:12,800
PACE LENDERS GET TO COLLECT

932
00:24:12,866 --> 00:24:14,933
THEIR MONEY FIRST, AHEAD OF THE

933
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,166
MORTGAGE LENDER OR ANYONE ELSE.

934
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:19,066
THE FACT THAT THAT'S THE CASE

935
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:20,000
ENABLES COMPANIES LIKE YGRENE

936
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:21,800
TO BUNDLE THAT DEBT TOGETHER AND

937
00:24:21,866 --> 00:24:23,900
SELL IT ON WALL STREET AS A VERY

938
00:24:23,966 --> 00:24:26,066
SAFE INVESTMENT.

939
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:27,500
BECAUSE FOR THOSE INVESTORS,

940
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:28,742
IT'S A NEAR-GUARANTEED RETURN.

941
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:29,666
BUT FOR HOMEOWNERS THEMSELVES,

942
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:32,066
IT CAN SPELL COMPLETE DISASTER.

943
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:33,466
FOR ONE THING, IT CAN MAKE IT

944
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:36,233
MUCH HARDER TO SELL YOUR HOUSE.

945
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,633
BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS TO BUY A

946
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,776
HOUSE WITH A LIEN ON IT FOR

947
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,876
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS,

948
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,533
FOR RENOVATIONS THAT MIGHT'VE

949
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,666
BEEN DONE A DECADE AGO.

950
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:44,266
IF YOU'RE HOUSE HUNTING AND YOU

951
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:45,442
FIND THAT OUT, IT'S LIKE HEARING

952
00:24:45,466 --> 00:24:47,133
THE REALTOR SAY, "HERE'S THE

953
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,280
GARAGE-SLASH-METH LAB," OR,

954
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:49,600
"HERE'S THE BASEMENT WHERE THE

955
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:51,100
KIDNAPPED KIDS WERE CHAINED UP,"

956
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:52,033
OR "HERE ARE THE POPCORN

957
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:52,833
CEILINGS."

958
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,166
IT IMMEDIATELY KILLS ANY APPEAL

959
00:24:54,233 --> 00:24:56,233
THE HOUSE EVER HELD.

960
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,766
AND IT'S NOT JUST HOMEOWNERS

961
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:59,666
RAISING THE ALARM HERE.

962
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:01,900
THAT PRIORITY LIEN PLACEMENT IS

963
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:03,300
THE PRIMARY REASON WHY, IN 2010,

964
00:25:03,366 --> 00:25:04,800
FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC

965
00:25:04,866 --> 00:25:06,566
STOPPED BACKING MORTGAGES ON

966
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:08,333
HOMES THAT HAD PACE LOANS.

967
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,300
AND THIS IS YET ANOTHER

968
00:25:10,366 --> 00:25:12,100
A POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING

969
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:13,242
CONSEQUENCE TO A SYSTEM WITH

970
00:25:13,266 --> 00:25:15,266
NO REAL ACCOUNTABILITY BAKED IN.

971
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:16,666
REMEMBER THAT CALIFORNIA COUPLE?

972
00:25:16,733 --> 00:25:18,900
HERE IS THEIR CONTRACTOR

973
00:25:18,966 --> 00:25:20,200
EXPLAINING WHY NONE OF WHAT

974
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:21,966
HAPPENED TO THEM IS HIS FAULT.

975
00:25:22,033 --> 00:25:23,133
DID YOU AS A CONTRACTOR,

976
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,600
THOUGH, EVER CONFIRM IF THEY HAD

977
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:25,933
THE ABILITY TO PAY?

978
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,266
BECAUSE THIS IS AN OLDER COUPLE

979
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:29,233
ON FIXED INCOME, THEY SAY

980
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,233
THERE'S NO WAY THEY COULD HAVE

981
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,066
PAID FOR THE WORK THAT YOU TOOK

982
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:33,500
ON IN THEIR HOUSE.

983
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:34,633
BUT... I DON'T QUALIFY

984
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,266
PEOPLE.

985
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,966
PACE QUALIFIES PEOPLE.

986
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:38,033
WELL, THERE'S A LOT OF

987
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:39,346
PASSING THE BUCK HERE BECAUSE...

988
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,533
NO, THERE'S NO PASSING

989
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,733
THE BUCK, MISS.

990
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,466
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IS TALK TO

991
00:25:43,533 --> 00:25:44,066
YGRENE, WHO THEY HAD THE

992
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:45,500
CONTRACT WITH.

993
00:25:45,566 --> 00:25:47,533
WELL, HOLD ON THERE.

994
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,833
BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY BOLD TO

995
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,333
CLAIM "THERE'S NO PASSING THE

996
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,476
BUCK," ONLY TO IMMEDIATELY THEN

997
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,000
PASS THE BUCK.

998
00:25:53,066 --> 00:25:55,166
IT HEARKENS BACK TO THAT FAMOUS

999
00:25:55,233 --> 00:25:56,000
SIGN IN HARRY TRUMAN'S OFFICE,

1000
00:25:56,066 --> 00:25:57,533
"THE BUCK STOPS HERE,

1001
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,833
WITH LARRY DOWN THE HALL,

1002
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,233
HE'S THE ONE WHO HANDLES

1003
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,133
ALL THE PAPERWORK, YOU SHOULD

1004
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,233
REALLY GO TALK TO HIM."

1005
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,766
THE POINT IS, EVERY PLAYER HERE

1006
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:06,766
IS PERPETUATING A CYCLE OF ZERO

1007
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,100
ACCOUNTABILITY.

1008
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,766
THE PACE ADMINISTRATORS BLAME

1009
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:10,233
THE CONTRACTORS.

1010
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,733
THE CONTRACTORS BLAME THE

1011
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,033
ADMINISTRATORS.

1012
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,142
AND SOMETIMES, THE FINGER OF

1013
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:14,966
BLAME GETS POINTED DIRECTLY

1014
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:17,433
AT THE CUSTOMERS THEMSELVES.

1015
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,966
BECAUSE HERE'S WHERE, LEGALLY,

1016
00:26:19,033 --> 00:26:20,233
I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT YGRENE

1017
00:26:20,266 --> 00:26:22,000
...WHICH IS ENERGY BACKWARDS,

1018
00:26:22,066 --> 00:26:23,866
BY THE WAY, IT'S VERY CLEVER...

1019
00:26:23,933 --> 00:26:26,533
INSISTS THAT THEY HAVE RIGOROUS

1020
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,100
DISCLOSURE PRACTICES, EXERCISE

1021
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:29,800
ROBUST OVERSIGHT OVER

1022
00:26:29,866 --> 00:26:30,733
CONTRACTORS, AND HAVE NEVER

1023
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:36,333
PERSONALLY FORECLOSED ON A HOME.

1024
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,676
THEY ALSO INSIST THAT THE COUPLE

1025
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:37,933
RECEIVED

1026
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,366
ALL THE APPROPRIATE FINANCING

1027
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:40,133
DOCUMENTS, AND THAT THEY, AND

1028
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,400
NOT YGRENE, SELECTED THE

1029
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:42,133
CONTRACTORS TO WORK ON THEIR

1030
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
HOUSE.

1031
00:26:43,266 --> 00:26:43,966
SORT OF IMPLYING THAT IT WAS ALL

1032
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:45,166
THEIR FAULT.

1033
00:26:45,233 --> 00:26:46,276
WHICH IS PRETTY HARD TO TAKE,

1034
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,900
GIVEN THAT YGRENE SELECTS WHICH

1035
00:26:47,966 --> 00:26:49,300
CONTRACTORS IT ALLOWS INTO ITS

1036
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:51,633
PROGRAM.

1037
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,033
IF YOUR SEAFOOD RESTAURANT SELLS

1038
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,766
TAINTED LOBSTERS, THEY SHOULDN'T

1039
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:55,466
GET TO SHRUG IT OFF BY SAYING,

1040
00:26:55,533 --> 00:26:56,833
"YOU PICKED THE ONE YOU WANTED

1041
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,666
OUT OF THE TANK," WHEN THEY PUT

1042
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:00,466
THOSE LOBSTERS IN THERE IN THE

1043
00:27:00,533 --> 00:27:01,766
FUCKING FIRST PLACE!

1044
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:03,533
AND COMPANIES ARE ALWAYS GOING

1045
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,600
TO INSIST THAT THIS IS JUST A

1046
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,466
PROBLEM OF A FEW BAD APPLE

1047
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:08,609
CONTRACTORS, AND THEY'RE ALWAYS

1048
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:09,933
IMPROVING THEIR PROCESSES.

1049
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,800
BUT I WOULD ARGUE THE FLAWS OF

1050
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:13,042
THIS PROGRAM ARE BAKED INTO HOW

1051
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:15,000
IT OPERATES.

1052
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,566
AND NO ONE KNOWS THIS BETTER

1053
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:19,233
THAN TAX COLLECTORS, BECAUSE

1054
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,100
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO END UP

1055
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:21,276
HAVING TO COLLECT ON THE DEBTS

1056
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:26,133
HOMEOWNERS RACK UP, AND ARE

1057
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,666
CAN BE THE ONES HAVING TO DO THE

1058
00:27:27,733 --> 00:27:28,000
FORECLOSURES.

1059
00:27:28,066 --> 00:27:29,309
JUST LISTEN TO THIS MISSOURI TAX

1060
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:30,066
COLLECTOR BEGGING HIS COUNTY TO

1061
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:31,000
GET RID OF ITS PACE PROGRAM JUST

1062
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:31,466
LAST MONTH.

1063
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:32,542
I CAN TELL YOU WHAT THE FACTS

1064
00:27:32,566 --> 00:27:34,466
THE MORE OF

1065
00:27:34,533 --> 00:27:36,233
THESE THAT YOU HAVE, SOME

1066
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,233
PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WILL LOSE

1067
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:37,866
THEIR HOUSES.

1068
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:39,333
AND YOU CAN MAKE THE CONSUMER

1069
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,442
PROTECTIONS BETTER, AND YOU

1070
00:27:40,466 --> 00:27:41,600
CAN MAKE THEM A LITTLE MORE

1071
00:27:41,666 --> 00:27:42,676
RIGOROUS, BUT AT THE END OF THE

1072
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,766
DAY, SOME PEOPLE WILL HAVE THEIR

1073
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:47,100
HOMES TAKEN FROM THEM.

1074
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:53,133
I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT

1075
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,209
THERE IS NO CIRCUMSTANCE, IN MY

1076
00:27:54,233 --> 00:27:56,033
OPINION, IN WHICH IT MAKES SENSE

1077
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,100
TO OFFER THE COUNTY'S POWER TO

1078
00:27:58,166 --> 00:27:59,566
TAKE YOUR HOUSE IN RETURN FOR

1079
00:27:59,633 --> 00:28:01,600
GETTING YOU MONEY TO BUY A NEW

1080
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:03,366
AIR CONDITIONER OR SOLAR PANEL

1081
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:05,933
OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE.

1082
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,200
EXACTLY.

1083
00:28:07,266 --> 00:28:08,409
NOBODY IN THIS COUNTRY SHOULD BE

1084
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:09,476
LOSING THEIR HOME BECAUSE OF AN

1085
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,733
AIR CONDITIONER!

1086
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,400
THEY SHOULD BE LOSING THEIR

1087
00:28:12,466 --> 00:28:13,766
HOME BECAUSE OF UNEXPECTED

1088
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:14,600
MEDICAL BILLS... YOU KNOW,

1089
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:16,600
LIKE AN AMERICAN!

1090
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:18,966
AND ALL OF THIS MAY BE

1091
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:20,076
COMING TO A HEAD IF FORECLOSURES

1092
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,233
BEGIN TO RISE IN THE WAKE

1093
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,133
OF THE PANDEMIC.

1094
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,733
IN FACT, ONE FLORIDA TAX

1095
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,700
COLLECTOR HAS EVEN WARNED

1096
00:28:25,766 --> 00:28:27,033
THAT PACE WILL BECOME FLORIDA'S

1097
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,633
NEXT MORTGAGE CRISIS IF WE'RE

1098
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,533
NOT CAREFUL.

1099
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,800
WHICH IS CHILLING.

1100
00:28:30,866 --> 00:28:32,900
BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS ARE PRIME

1101
00:28:32,966 --> 00:28:33,900
FOR A DISASTER, BUT IT SEEMS

1102
00:28:33,966 --> 00:28:35,126
LIKE WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING

1103
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:35,900
TO STOP IT.

1104
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:37,633
IT'S LIKE HOW WE INEXPLICABLY

1105
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,033
LET HARRISON FORD CONTINUE TO

1106
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,533
FLY PLANES.

1107
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,933
WE ALL KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO

1108
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,633
HAPPEN!

1109
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,333
SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING BEFORE

1110
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,700
IT'S TOO LATE!

1111
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,800
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

1112
00:28:47,866 --> 00:28:49,866
WELL, WE COULD TRY REFORMS LIKE

1113
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:51,566
STOPPING DOOR-TO-DOOR SALES.

1114
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:52,776
BUT THE TRUTH IS, AS THAT GUY

1115
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,433
SAID, PEOPLE COULD STILL END UP

1116
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,333
LOSING THEIR HOMES.

1117
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,333
THE TOUGHER QUESTION MIGHT BE

1118
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,900
WHETHER OR NOT REFORM IS EVEN

1119
00:29:00,966 --> 00:29:01,166
WORTH IT.

1120
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:02,276
BECAUSE FOR THE RECORD, PACE

1121
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,000
ISN'T THE ONLY WAY LOW-INCOME

1122
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:05,800
HOMEOWNERS CAN GET HELP TO

1123
00:29:05,866 --> 00:29:08,166
FINANCE GREEN ENERGY UPGRADES.

1124
00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:09,300
NATIONALLY, THERE'S

1125
00:29:09,366 --> 00:29:10,406
THE LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY

1126
00:29:10,433 --> 00:29:12,266
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, AND

1127
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,100
THE FEDERAL WEATHERIZATION

1128
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:15,533
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, OR WAP, AS

1129
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,600
IT'S KNOWN TO ABSOLUTELY NO ONE.

1130
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:18,776
AND IN FLORIDA AND CALIFORNIA

1131
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,166
SPECIFICALLY, THERE ARE SEVERAL

1132
00:29:20,233 --> 00:29:21,966
PROGRAMS THAT CAN ASSIST

1133
00:29:22,033 --> 00:29:23,366
LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS

1134
00:29:23,433 --> 00:29:25,366
IN ENERGY FUNDING.

1135
00:29:25,433 --> 00:29:27,633
THE POINT IS, IF YOU, YOUR

1136
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,500
PARENTS, OR ANYONE YOU KNOW IS

1137
00:29:29,566 --> 00:29:31,166
CONSIDERING A PACE LOAN,

1138
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:35,300
YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY SEE IF

1139
00:29:35,366 --> 00:29:37,733
YOU OR THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR

1140
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,133
PROGRAMS LIKE THESE FIRST.

1141
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,280
AND IF YOU LIVE IN A COUNTY

1142
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:41,573
THAT'S THINKING OF IMPLEMENTING

1143
00:29:41,633 --> 00:29:42,966
A PACE PROGRAM WITH FOR PROFIT

1144
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:43,600
ADMINISTRATORS, DO WHATEVER YOU

1145
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:45,566
CAN TO STOP IT.

1146
00:29:45,633 --> 00:29:46,933
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, THIS

1147
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,333
BUSINESS MODEL IS FUNDAMENTALLY

1148
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
FLAWED.

1149
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:51,366
AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT

1150
00:29:51,433 --> 00:29:52,366
AFFORDABLE CLEAN ENERGY ISN'T

1151
00:29:52,433 --> 00:29:53,000
SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE INVESTING

1152
00:29:53,066 --> 00:29:53,966
IN.

1153
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:55,933
IT ABSOLUTELY IS.

1154
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,733
BUT WE SHOULDN'T BE PUTTING

1155
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,466
VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN A POSITION

1156
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:00,542
WHERE THEY'RE RISKING THEIR

1157
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:01,366
HOMES.

1158
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:02,933
SADLY, THIS IS YET ANOTHER

1159
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,933
EXAMPLE WHERE A WELL-MEANING

1160
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,233
PUBLIC PROGRAM HAS BEEN

1161
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,000
CORRUPTED BY THE PRESENCE OF

1162
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:08,466
PRIVATE COMPANIES.

1163
00:30:08,533 --> 00:30:10,033
AND IF THEY COME TO WHERE YOU

1164
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,100
LIVE, YOU WOULD BE WELL ADVISED

1165
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:13,866
TO TELL THEM TO KCUF FFO.

1166
00:30:13,933 --> 00:30:15,000
IT'S ACTUALLY "FUCK OFF,"

1167
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:16,000
BACKWARDS.

1168
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:17,733
MOST PEOPLE DON'T FIGURE THAT

1169
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,840
OUT, BUT AFTER A COUPLE OF

1170
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,140
REMINDERS, THEY USUALLY GET IT.

1171
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,333
AND NOW, THIS.

1172
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:26,133
AND NOW...

1173
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,433
THE WINNER OF BEST IN SHOW AT

1174
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,400
THE WESTMINSTER DOG SHOW BREAKS

1175
00:30:31,466 --> 00:30:31,833
NEWSCASTER'S BRAINS.

1176
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,433
SO I THOUGHT IT WAS... I

1177
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,733
MEAN, HE IS PRETTY, OBVIOUSLY.

1178
00:30:37,033 --> 00:30:37,600
IT'S JUST HAIR.

1179
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:40,366
IT LOOKS LIKE A HEAD OF HAIR.

1180
00:30:40,433 --> 00:30:43,066
LIKE, AMBER, I PICTURE... I

1181
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:45,366
PICTURE YOURS OR MY HAIR JUST

1182
00:30:45,433 --> 00:30:48,033
WALKING ON THE GROUND WITH NO

1183
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,366
LEGS.

1184
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:49,600
LIKE...

1185
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:51,700
SOMEONE'S WIG IS CONTROLLING

1186
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:52,933
THEIR BRAIN.

1187
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,466
WALKING ACROSS THE GROUND.

1188
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:55,766
AN ALIEN.

1189
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:57,833
THIS IS GORGEOUS.

1190
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,900
IT'S JUST SO WEIRD.

1191
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:00,766
IS SUPER ODD LOOKING.

1192
00:31:00,833 --> 00:31:01,900
GOOD FOR HIM.

1193
00:31:01,966 --> 00:31:03,666
A SPEAKER THAT PERSON PROBABLY

1194
00:31:03,733 --> 00:31:06,433
SPENT MORE TIME ON THAT

1195
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:06,966
DOG'S HAIR...

1196
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:07,666
AND MONEY.

1197
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:09,633
THEN THE THREE OF US COMBINED

1198
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,600
AND WE ARE ON TV EVERY DAY.

1199
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,433
I'M NOT INTO THAT.

1200
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,666
IT'S JUST NOT CUTE.

1201
00:31:14,733 --> 00:31:16,100
IT IS SO UGLY.

1202
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,200
THAT IS SUCH AN UGLY DOG.

1203
00:31:18,266 --> 00:31:19,433
NO OFFENSE TO ANYBODY.

1204
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,233
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT IS AN UGLY

1205
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,066
DOG AND THEN SAY "NO OFFENSE."

1206
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:24,000
YOU HAVE OFFENDED.

1207
00:31:24,066 --> 00:31:26,100
I DON'T MEAN IT TO BE

1208
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:27,000
OFFENSIVE.

1209
00:31:27,066 --> 00:31:27,800
IT LOOKS LIKE A WALKING WIG.

1210
00:31:27,866 --> 00:31:29,966
IT LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE IN IT.

1211
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:34,000
A VERY UNIQUE LOOK THAT

1212
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:34,433
WASABI HAS.

1213
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,333
WHAT DO YOU MEAN UNIQUE LOOK?

1214
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,966
FURRY.

1215
00:31:39,033 --> 00:31:42,300
YOU MEAN THOMAS MOST FACE?

1216
00:31:42,366 --> 00:31:47,000
...SMOOSHED FACE?

1217
00:31:47,066 --> 00:31:49,433
I WAS ASKING A SERIOUS QUESTION.

1218
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:49,600
YES.

1219
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:51,400
THAT WAS OUR SHOW.

1220
00:31:51,466 --> 00:31:52,866
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

1221
00:31:52,933 --> 00:31:54,700
WE WILL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

1222
00:31:54,766 --> 00:31:55,766
GOOD NIGHT.
