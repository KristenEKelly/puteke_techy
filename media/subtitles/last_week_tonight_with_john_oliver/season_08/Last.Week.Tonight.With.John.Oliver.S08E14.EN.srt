1
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,520
Hi ! Welcome to the show,

2
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,120
still taking place in this blank void,
which I've nicknamed "Henry Kissinger"

3
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,880
because it's white, unpleasant
and I'm just mad it's still around.

4
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,560
Another busy week. Netanyahu looks
like he may have lost power,

5
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,400
Fauci's emails were released

6
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,600
and the White House partnered
with Anheuser-Busch

7
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,280
to offer free beer
to incentivize vaccines.

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,920
"Rewarding you with beer"
really cements Joe Biden's status

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,120
as America's uncle who probably
shouldn't be left in charge.

10
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,600
As the vaccination rollout
continues in the US

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,520
and life slowly returns to normal,
it is worth remembering

12
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,520
many other countries are still very
much in the grips of this pandemic.

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,080
Take the United Kingdom,

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,960
which is currently planning
to fully reopen later this month,

15
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,120
even as experts warn a potential
third wave of Covid may be underway.

16
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,800
Demand is also growing there
for a public inquiry

17
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,440
into Boris Johnson's
mismanagement of the pandemic,

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,200
following testimony
in a committee hearing last week

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,960
from former top advisor
and "smug Moby", Dominic Cummings.

20
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,560
He revealed a chilling moment
from last March,

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,320
when top government officials
realized just how badly

22
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,600
the pandemic planning
had been botched.

23
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,360
At this point, the second most
powerful official in the country,

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,880
Helen MacNamara,
is the deputy cabinet secretary.

25
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,680
She walked into the office,
she says:

26
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,720
"I've just been talking
to the official, Mark Sweeney,"

27
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,680
"who is in charge of coordinating
with the Department for Health."

28
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,760
He said: "I've been told for years
that there is a whole plan for this."

29
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,360
"There is no plan.
We're in huge trouble."

30
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,200
Helen MacNamara said:

31
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,080
"I've come through here to the Prime
Minister's office to tell you all,"

32
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,880
quote:
"I think we are absolutely fucked."

33
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,680
No plan. We're in huge trouble.
I think we're absolutely fucked.

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,440
You do not expect to hear
an assessment that grim

35
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,440
unless it's from the team behind
the Fyre Festival

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,360
or Warner Brothers Discovery.

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,280
Hi there, new business daddy !
Just checking in to say

38
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,400
I absolutely love the corporate logo
you dropped this week !

39
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,480
It looks like the opening title
of "The Simpsons"

40
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,440
if the font were not found.

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,960
And quick note: "the stuff
that dreams are made of"

42
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,720
is a quote
from "The Maltese Falcon"

43
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,160
about how the thing that seemed
like a priceless treasure

44
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,440
was actually worthless garbage that
brought chaos and despair to everyone.

45
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,640
Anyway, good luck with the merger,
I'm sure everything's gonna go great !

46
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,160
The truth is, as bad as the details
of Cummings' testimony were,

47
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,080
the U.K.'s Covid response pales
next to that of Brazil's.

48
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,560
Because the handling of the pandemic
by its president, Jair Bolsonaro,

49
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,360
has been a spectacular failure,
with the country recording

50
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,920
over 1.9 million new cases
in the past month alone.

51
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,840
Brazilians are understandably fed up,
staging protests across the country.

52
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,440
Demonstrators want this government
to account for the negligence

53
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,400
in purchasing vaccines after trying
to lead Brazil towards herd immunity.

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,960
Brazilian people always got vaccinated.
It could have been the first country

55
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,320
with the whole population vaccinated.
Instead, we see such irresponsibility.

56
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,480
That woman makes a great point,

57
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,880
despite wearing
what I assume biologists use

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,960
to disguise themselves
while watching crocodiles fuck.

59
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,160
The Brazilian government
is in the midst of an inquiry

60
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,200
into its own negligence,
and it has uncovered some bombshells,

61
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,280
including that last August, Pfizer
offered Brazil's health ministry

62
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,080
70 million doses
of the vaccine it was developing,

63
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,440
but the company "got no answer".

64
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,680
And come on, Brazil.
You can't ghost Pfizer.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,760
They're a company who was offering
you a potentially life-saving vaccine,

66
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,960
not a fruitarian entrepreneur
slash poet you met on OkCupid.

67
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,520
In that case,
absolutely hit "ignore".

68
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,680
And that shouldn't even be surprising

69
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,320
given how publicly dismissive
Bolsonaro's been of the vaccines.

70
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,680
That woman's crocodile hat
wasn't just showcasing her ability

71
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,480
to serve looks that are exuberant
without being obnoxious.

72
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,600
She was making an explicit reference
to a shitty joke Bolsonaro told,

73
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,560
about how companies wouldn't take
responsibility for side effects.

74
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,440
If you turn into a crocodile,
it's your problem.

75
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,520
If you turn into Superman,
if a woman grows a beard

76
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,200
or a man starts speaking in a high
voice, they want nothing to do with it.

77
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,960
That's obviously complete bullshit, but
if I may just address his insinuation

78
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,640
that "if the vaccine turns you into
a crocodile, that's your problem."

79
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,400
Honey, no. If you turn into
a crocodile, it's your solution.

80
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,040
Crocodiles are incredible swimmers,
they can see at night

81
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,440
and, instead of sweating, they do
something called "mouth gaping"

82
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,920
that looks a little like this.

83
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,000
And think how much embarrassment
that would save you on a hot day !

84
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,680
No pit stains on you, buddy.
Just mouth open, dick out,

85
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,560
swimming through life
without a care.

86
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,520
Because, thank fucking God,
you're a crocodile.

87
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,440
When you combine this new inquiry's
findings with Brazil's death rate,

88
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,320
it's frankly no wonder polls
now show 57 percent of Brazilians

89
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,320
backing Bolsonaro's impeachment.

90
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,480
But not only is he not backing down,
just this week, he approved this.

91
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,640
The country with the world's second
largest Covid-19 death toll

92
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,880
will host the Copa America,
welcoming South American teams

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,240
for a four week football tournament.

94
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,320
Yeah ! Brazil is suddenly
hosting a massive soccer tournament

95
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,360
on just 13 days' notice.

96
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,960
It was originally supposed
to be hosted by Argentina,

97
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,720
but it was canceled
due to Covid rates.

98
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,160
Despite that, Bolsonaro, whose
country's rates are higher,

99
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,160
is now choosing to host a tournament

100
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,880
one senator has dubbed
"the championship of death"

101
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,280
and which has inspired memes
like this to make the rounds in Brazil.

102
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,160
I will say, that is a pretty
cheerful little coffin.

103
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,120
It looks like Clippy the paperclip
popping up to ask you:

104
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,160
"It looks like you're about to host
a soccer tournament"

105
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,040
"while your country's death toll
is sky high."

106
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,360
"Would you like
to not fucking do that ?"

107
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,360
What's happening in Brazil
should be a warning for everyone,

108
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,200
because if vaccine misinformation
continues to spread

109
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,120
and variants continue to emerge,

110
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,480
the whole world could remain
in trouble for a very long time.

111
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,040
Despite how well things seem
to be going right now in the U.S.,

112
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,760
if we don't actively help get
this virus under control globally,

113
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,520
then, to quote a former
top U.K. official...

114
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,120
I think we are absolutely fucked.

115
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,400
Exactly. And now, this.

116
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:31,720
People On TV Lose Their Shit Over
The Phrase "Hot Vax Summer".

117
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,200
The hot vax summer. That's what they're
calling it. I can't make this up.

118
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,680
'Cause last summer
was hot girl summer.

119
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,080
- They just substituted that word.
- All right.

120
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,800
All vax-ed up, no place to go,
it's a hot vax summer !

121
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,880
I'm dressed for hot vax summer.

122
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,200
The hot vax summer.

123
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,720
- Hot vax, summer in the city.
- No !

124
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,720
So, a play on the "Hot Girl Summer"
from Megan Thee Stallion.

125
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,720
Three words: hot vax summer.
Consumers are ready to spend...

126
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,040
Hot vax summer. I'm telling you.

127
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,440
I don't know if you can tell,
I'm blushing.

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,120
Okay, Jan ? Jan ?
What are you saying ?

129
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,440
I'm gonna borrow that, Charles.
I love that philosophy.

130
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,440
It's going to be a hot vax summer.

131
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,960
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns Asian Americans.

132
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,320
A group that currently makes up
around 7 percent of the U.S. population

133
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,920
and is actually
the fastest-growing racial group,

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,840
and yet despite that, Asian Americans
can sometimes be oddly overlooked.

135
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,240
A survey asked respondents to simply
name a well-known Asian American

136
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,240
and the results were not good.

137
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,560
42 percent of people
said they don't know one.

138
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,440
The next most popular answers
were Jackie Chan,

139
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,200
who's from Hong Kong,
and Bruce Lee, who died in 1973.

140
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,440
Come on. No disrespect
to Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee there,

141
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,920
but that is embarrassing
even before you consider

142
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,880
the poll was conducted
while Kamala Harris,

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,520
who's Asian American,
was vice president.

144
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,240
How do you fuck up
a question that easy ?

145
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,400
It'd be like asking Americans
to name a well-known Joe

146
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,040
and getting back: "What's Joe ?"

147
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,480
"John Krasinski"
and "Joe Millionaire".

148
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,120
It is pretty clear many in this country
don't seem to know much

149
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,440
about the histories
or experiences of Asian Americans.

150
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,400
And to the extent that experience
has been discussed in recent years,

151
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,520
it's often been in a tragic context,
such as killings or mass shootings

152
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,000
or racism around the coronavirus
triggering verbal and physical attacks,

153
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,360
as well as the kind of idiocy
that forced local news

154
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,160
to have to produce pieces like:

155
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,400
"No, you can't get coronavirus
by eating Chinese food."

156
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,320
Of course you fucking can't.

157
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,400
You're about as likely to get
coronavirus from eating Chinese food

158
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,960
as you are to get chicken pox
from eating KFC.

159
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,160
That's not going to happen and
it's alarming anyone thought it might.

160
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,240
All of this has highlighted the need
to have a better-informed conversation

161
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,440
about the way this country
regards Asian Americans.

162
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,480
And before we start: I fully recognize
the history of white people on TV

163
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,280
generalizing confidently
about this subject isn't great,

164
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,640
sometimes making statements
that are offensive,

165
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,000
even when they think
they're being complimentary,

166
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,480
like this idea
that has come up constantly.

167
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,400
They've worked their way past
Column As and Column Bs,

168
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,920
past "no starch please",
to become our nation's model minority.

169
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,600
Listen to the numbers.

170
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,880
Median family income,
higher for Asians than for whites.

171
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,440
Super-achieving Asian American
students are becoming a phenomenon.

172
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,320
They are overachievers driven
to excel by tradition.

173
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,040
The academic achievement
of Asian American students

174
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,240
are so notable that in some colleges,
students warn each other

175
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,160
that if they end up in a class with
a lot of Oriental faces, get out.

176
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,760
The grading curve, they say,
will go out of sight.

177
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,120
It is jarring to hear, especially when
delivered with such a weird combination

178
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,800
of amused self-satisfaction and
totally inappropriate sourcing.

179
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,000
I was eavesdropping
on some teens last week

180
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,000
and I heard one of them say: "Never
share a cab with a Black person."

181
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,360
Just thought I'd pass that along.

182
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,720
This has been, for some reason,
the news.

183
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,720
But that idea, that Asian Americans
are a model minority,

184
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,360
has been as persistent
as it is problematic.

185
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,440
We thought we'd try and unpack
both parts of this sentence.

186
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,680
Let's start with the first half:
Asian Americans.

187
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,440
We're going to spend
most of our time on this term,

188
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,680
because it's having to do
a lot of work.

189
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,600
It encompasses a vast group

190
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,440
who can trace their heritage
back to more than 20 countries,

191
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,120
covering a huge amount
of the world's land mass,

192
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,640
from Mongolia, to Indonesia,
to Pakistan, to Japan.

193
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,480
Even some who fall under
the term "Asian American",

194
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,720
or the broader "AAPI",
which includes Pacific Islanders,

195
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,640
feel that it may not fit them
or that the broadness of the category

196
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,920
means their experiences
get erased.

197
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,440
People associate Asian
with East Asian.

198
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,360
Filipinos aren't so much dismissed,
they're just overlooked,

199
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,040
just because they're not as popular
within at least the American culture.

200
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,280
Sometimes I will identify as Asian,

201
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,200
but then other Indian people
don't identify as Asian.

202
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,560
Why are you considered Asian,
you're in the Pacific Islander,

203
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,160
wouldn't you be considered
more Hawaiian ? I'm like, not really !

204
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,840
The term "Asian American" applies

205
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,280
to a ridiculously large
and diverse group of people.

206
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,520
And there is clearly not going to be
enough time to discuss everyone

207
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,200
who supposedly fits
under that umbrella in this piece,

208
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,560
even though I do intend
to talk very fast.

209
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,240
Apologies in advance
to all 127 Maldivian Americans.

210
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,200
I promise I will make it up to my one
Maldivian American fan in the future.

211
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,080
I'm serious, Kareem,
stay with me, trust me on this,

212
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,280
you will be seen.

213
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,040
But the fact the term "Asian American"
is so incredibly broad

214
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,360
isn't an accident, it was kind
of the point from the start.

215
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,840
It was first coined in the late 1960s

216
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,560
by Asian American
student activists in California,

217
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,000
who went on strike alongside Black,
Hispanic, and Native American students

218
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,440
to demand
an ethnic studies curriculum.

219
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,280
In those days, the term
Asian American didn't exist.

220
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,080
We were all Orientals.

221
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,080
1968, that was the first time
that I heard the term Asian Americans.

222
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,280
Asian American encompasses
everybody. I thought, that's something.

223
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,880
People are finally starting to realize
that we wear our race on our face.

224
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,040
It's true. Under a system
of white supremacy,

225
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,560
we do tend to
"wear our race on our face".

226
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,840
My face is currently wearing
down market vintage colonial casual.

227
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,000
I'd change it into something
a little less imperial if I could,

228
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,560
but I can't,
so instead I wear these glasses.

229
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,240
For those activists, the term
"Asian American" was an attempt

230
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,600
to unite a massively diffuse
community in solidarity,

231
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,640
thus increasing their power, and,
crucially, forcing their universities

232
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,440
to devote resources to making sure

233
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,000
the histories of all their communities
were actually taught.

234
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,640
It was a political term,
a radical redefinition at the time.

235
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,520
But, it's since become a common
shorthand that can, unfortunately,

236
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,200
end up being used in a way that is
far too reductive and superficial,

237
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,120
to the point where an old
government PSA felt the need

238
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,080
to make a pretty obvious statement.

239
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,880
People always ask me
how I like America.

240
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,520
My great-grandfather was born here.

241
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,560
Like most Americans,
we've been American for a long time.

242
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,720
Some of us follow Asian tradition.
My family is apple pie American.

243
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,040
Minibikes, football, rock guitar.

244
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,440
All Asian Americans are no more alike
than any other kind of American.

245
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,840
We don't all look alike, do we ?
Well, do we ?

246
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,680
The fuck ?
Government money paid for that ?

247
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,640
Even this kid has a smirk that says:
"fucking white people".

248
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,760
Although, I will admit, the writer of
that PSA defining "apple pie American"

249
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,040
as "minibikes, football, rock guitar"
is magnificent.

250
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,000
It should be the oath of citizenship.
You put your hand over your heart,

251
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,000
say: "minibikes, football, rock guitar"

252
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,320
and then you never ride
a regular-sized bike again.

253
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,800
Why ?
Because you are an American now.

254
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,760
Recognizing the diversity
of Asian Americans is about much more

255
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,640
than simply recognizing those three
children have three different faces.

256
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,120
One of the main dangers of treating
Asian Americans as a single entity

257
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,480
is that it obscures the reality

258
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,400
of what is happening for
the different subgroups inside it.

259
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,880
For example, about 10 percent
of Asian Americans live in poverty,

260
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,040
which is actually "lower than
the overall U.S. poverty rate".

261
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,120
When you disaggregate the data,
when you break it down by subgroup,

262
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,120
you start to see
a much more complicated situation,

263
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,640
with Mongolian and Burmese Americans
having a poverty rate of 25 percent,

264
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,120
"more than twice
the national average."

265
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,200
When it comes to education, while
around 75 percent of Indian Americans

266
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,480
have a bachelor's degree,
well above the national average,

267
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,440
for Bhutanese Americans, that figure
is just 15 percent, well below it.

268
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,000
The point is, disaggregating the data

269
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,280
can reveal big disparities
that you couldn't see previously.

270
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,480
Looking at averages
for Asian Americans as a whole

271
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,640
is like looking at the average income
of the Hemsworth brothers.

272
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,520
It's very misleading when we all know
some hems are worth a lot more

273
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,200
than other hems are worth.

274
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,280
Using the term "Asian Americans"
to represent a political coalition

275
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,480
made sense, and still does,
to some extent.

276
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,800
But a coalition is not a monolith.
And to start to understand

277
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,480
some of the present day differences,
it really helps to understand

278
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,080
the differences in when and how
people came to this country.

279
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,240
You can break down those experiences
into a few broad categories,

280
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,640
starting with those who arrived
earlier in the 19th century

281
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,640
and the first half of the 20th.

282
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,720
Asian immigration in that time
was essentially a cycle

283
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,760
of economic exploitation, followed
by a violent and restrictive backlash.

284
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,000
This began with Chinese immigrants,

285
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,040
who were recruited to work
on the railroads in the 1860s.

286
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,000
They faced virulent racism
from the beginning,

287
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,840
both from their bosses,
who saw their lives as disposable,

288
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,960
and from whites, many of whom saw
them as unfair competition for jobs.

289
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,440
At the time,
this senator from California

290
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,800
described Chinese immigrants as
"automatic engines of flesh and blood",

291
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,320
making them sound like some kind
of railroad-laying terminators,

292
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,680
and demanded
the federal government secure

293
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,720
the "American Anglo-Saxon civilization
without contamination or adulteration."

294
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,200
And in 1882, with the Chinese
Exclusion Act, he got his wish.

295
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,080
The Chinese Exclusion Law

296
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,520
is one of the first really
comprehensively restrictive laws.

297
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,400
It's also the first and only time
in the history of the United States

298
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,000
that a group is singled out by name,

299
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,120
Chinese, by name,
as being undesirable.

300
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,000
So, this
is truly a remarkable moment.

301
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,600
The poster said: "Hip ! Hurrah !"
to the Chinese Exclusion Act,

302
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,920
and if you look at the whole thing,
it says in the middle:

303
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,360
"Hip ! Hurrah !
The White Man is on Top."

304
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,040
Which is a bit redundant.
If you've said: "Hip ! Hurrah !" twice,

305
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,640
you really don't need to say:
"The White Man is on Top."

306
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,520
It's like saying
"blue lives matter"

307
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,960
or "welcome
to Carrie Bradshaw's bedroom."

308
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,240
"The white man on top" part
is very much implied.

309
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,680
And America committed
to that exclusion policy.

310
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,320
Here is something
you might not know:

311
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,400
There were six Chinese men who
survived the sinking of the Titanic,

312
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
but, upon reaching U.S. shores,

313
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,200
were "not permitted to enter
the United States" to recover.

314
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,640
They were forced onto another boat
and sent away the very next day.

315
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,640
Which isn't just racist,
it's insensitive.

316
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,200
Did it really have
to be another boat ?

317
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,000
They had just been on the best boat
and it fucking sucked.

318
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,560
Could you not put them
on a zeppelin or something ?

319
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,400
At the very least, let's try and mix up

320
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,640
the doomed turn of the century
transportation methods here.

321
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,440
The experience of Chinese immigrants
unfortunately set the template

322
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,000
for the different groups
that followed.

323
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,360
Because waves of Japanese, Korean,
South Asian and Filipino immigrants

324
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,440
later came over
as agricultural workers,

325
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,360
with those in charge often pitting
the groups against each other

326
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,440
with unequal wages and treatment.

327
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,800
Each group faced the comon
eperience of racial hostility,

328
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,440
violence, and laws
denying them the possibility

329
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,480
of becoming citizens
or owning land.

330
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,840
Here is a poster
targeting Chinese people,

331
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,680
here is a sign targeting Japanese,
and here is one targeting Filipinos.

332
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,760
It's just like
the Statue of Liberty says:

333
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,720
"Give me your tired, your poor,
your huddled masses..."

334
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,760
"But not over there. Not there
either. Definitely not in Maine."

335
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,840
"You guys just figure it out.
The signs will make it really obvious."

336
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,720
No matter how long Asian Americans
or families had been in this country,

337
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,040
they were, as now,
treated as perpetual foreigners

338
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,680
whose loyalties were in question,
with the most famous example of this

339
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,080
being the World War II
internment camps,

340
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,600
where 120 000 Japanese Americans,
who'd been rounded up en masse,

341
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,840
were imprisoned.

342
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,600
And to add insult to injury, when
they were finally allowed to leave,

343
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,320
the U.S. government had the gall
to try and give it a positive spin.

344
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,440
If you don't have money enough
to get to your new location,

345
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,080
the government through W.R.A.
will make a grant of enough money

346
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,640
to get you there, and a little extra
until the paychecks start coming in.

347
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,680
This money
does not have to be repaid,

348
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,080
it's a helping hand from Uncle Sam.

349
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,080
It's a big moment when you start
to pack for your trip outside.

350
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,840
It's an even bigger moment
when you walk through the gates,

351
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,280
for the last time.

352
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,360
And present your pass to the guard
for the last time.

353
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,680
And take a look at the barbed wire
fence for the last time.

354
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,480
As you look at that barbed wire,

355
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,280
you can think "fuck you, America"
for the last time.

356
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,560
Go ahead. We're cool with it.
You can even say it out loud.

357
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,160
We'll pretend we didn't hear you
and then we'll be even.

358
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,680
In fact, you know what,
let's shake on that.

359
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,400
You can say: "fuck you, America"
one time, and then we'll be cool.

360
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,040
Around the middle of the last century,
attitudes began to shift

361
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,520
as the U.S., locked in a Cold War,
came to see exclusion laws

362
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,200
and racial quotas
as bad for its global image.

363
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,840
Laws like the Chinese Exclusion Act
went away,

364
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,680
to eventually be replaced
by the 1965 Immigration Act.

365
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,680
And this is the next broad category
of Asian American immigrants:

366
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,000
those who came post-1965
as a result of that act.

367
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,320
Because in contrast
to the previous migrants,

368
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,480
who were generally relegated
to low wage manual labor,

369
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,320
a key thing that this law did

370
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,600
was prioritize educated
and highly skilled workers,

371
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,240
like doctors and engineers.

372
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,160
And it also tried to address
specific labor needs,

373
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,840
like when a nursing shortage resulted
in overseas ads like these.

374
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,440
Labor recruiters and travel agencies
started targeting Filipino nurses

375
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,640
with ads that promised them
bright futures in America.

376
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,360
One particular ad featured

377
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,440
a basket that was decorated
with the Philippines flag.

378
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,880
It's addressing
the Filipino nurse saying:

379
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,160
"Dear nurse, if you're not happy
where you are right now", contact us

380
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,520
and
"we can't promise you happiness,"

381
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,600
"but we can help you
chase it all over the place."

382
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,840
I've gotta say,
that is a refreshingly honest slogan.

383
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,920
"You might not catch happiness,
but you can chase it !"

384
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,080
And it did seem to work,

385
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,240
as nurses are one of this country's
top imports from the Philippines,

386
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,680
followed closely by,
of course, Jollibee,

387
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,120
the world's greatest fast-food mascot.

388
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,240
Because believe me: unlike
American labor recruiters in the '60s,

389
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,640
Jollibee can promise you happiness
and deliver it to you,

390
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,240
in videos like this.

391
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,520
Yes, please. I don't know
what I love more there:

392
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,240
Jollibee tastefully shaking
that stinger

393
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,360
like it's a bottle of his signature
banana ketchup,

394
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,760
or the coy flutter of those naughty,
humanoid eyes. Jollibee can get it.

395
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,400
So, very broadly,
Asian Americans before 1965

396
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,840
were largely exploited for their labor
and legally discriminated against,

397
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,000
while after 1965, there were many
more who came as skilled workers

398
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,760
and who faced fewer
formal legal barriers.

399
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,800
Then there's the final group here,

400
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,920
that has less to do
with America's labor needs

401
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,440
and more to do
with its geopolitical interests:

402
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,520
those who arrived as refugees.

403
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,160
Between 1975 and 2010,
we took in over a million refugees

404
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
from Vietnam,
Laos and Cambodia.

405
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,200
Which wasn't so much generous
as it was a direct result

406
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,640
of people seeking refuge from wars
that America waged in the region.

407
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,600
We bombed their countries
to thwart the spread of communism,

408
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,560
sometimes in secret wars to
fulfill Henry Kissinger's napalm kink,

409
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,960
and then,
once we took those refugees in,

410
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,080
we didn't really do much
to set them up for success.

411
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,080
When it comes to refugees,
we hold a lot of trauma, PTSD,

412
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,600
a lot of mental illness
from the war and the genocide.

413
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,040
We have in the U.S.
with respect to our refugee policy,

414
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,400
this doctrine of "work first
or work immediately".

415
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,440
Doesn't matter
if you just came from a war zone

416
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,640
and haven't healed from
the mental and physical traumas of war,

417
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,320
we want you to get a low wage
job immediately.

418
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,120
And that is really the full spectrum
of the American experience, isn't it ?

419
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,760
To go from the U.S. not giving
a shit about your life abroad,

420
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,640
to not giving a shit
about your life here.

421
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,080
Good luck ! And by the way,
if you think you hear bombs again,

422
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,960
try not to freak out, it's either
a holiday half the country kinda hates

423
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,960
or some couple telling their friends
what gender their baby is.

424
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,880
Welcome to America !

425
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:32,520
Different groups of Asian Americans
had divergent migration experiences.

426
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,160
When you understand them more,
the variation that you see,

427
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,120
in everything from income
to education to health outcomes,

428
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,720
begins to make sense.

429
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45,280
And yet, groups that have,
in some ways, so little in common,

430
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,720
often have been unified through
the common experience of bigotry,

431
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,960
as was the case in the early 1980s,
when America's fear

432
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,200
of an economically ascendant Japan
led to a racist fervor at home.

433
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,520
Pretty soon, the finger
of blame ended up on Japan.

434
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,200
All of this hatred,
you could feel it, it was palpable.

435
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,160
Detroiters were invited
for 50 cents a smash

436
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,600
to take out
their anger on Japanese cars.

437
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,400
That's stupid. I honestly can't think
of a good reason to beat up a car,

438
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,400
except maybe if Lightning McQueen
owes you money.

439
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,000
And to be honest, even then,
if you really want to hurt him,

440
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,720
you don't beat him
with a sledgehammer.

441
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,440
You light Mater on fire
and you make him watch.

442
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,880
That's what you do.
Everybody knows that.

443
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,000
Where is my fucking money, McQueen ?

444
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,200
But tragically, and unsurprisingly,

445
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,080
that type of resentment and blame
turned to violence,

446
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,800
and eventually culminated
in the murder of Vincent Chin,

447
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,320
a Chinese American man who was
beaten to death by two white men

448
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,880
who blamed him for what Japan
was doing to the U.S. auto industry.

449
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,400
Chin's killers
were arrested and convicted,

450
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,080
but the judge sentenced them
to exactly no prison time,

451
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,960
instead giving each of them
three years' probation

452
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,440
and less than 4 000 dollars in fines.

453
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,520
And he insisted at the time
he'd made the right decision.

454
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,120
Judge Charles Kaufman
says justice was done.

455
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,920
He would not talk to CBS News,
but he did tell a Detroit newspaper

456
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,720
that the two defendants were longtime,
hardworking members of the community,

457
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,400
adding: "These men are not going
to go out and harm somebody else."

458
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,160
"I just didn't think
that putting them in prison"

459
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,360
"would do any good
for them or for society."

460
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,480
It gets worse !
That judge also said:

461
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,360
"these weren't the kind of men
you send to jail."

462
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,480
And it's hard to tell what criteria
that judge used to decide

463
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,160
what kind of men
these two murderers were.

464
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,680
Was it the color of the skin
on their faces ?

465
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,960
The color of the skin on their hands ?
Or just judicial instinct,

466
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,520
a gut feeling that these two men
were, in fact, white ?

467
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,400
That's the thing
about the criminal justice system:

468
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,720
at the end of the day,
it's more race art than race science.

469
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,080
But the enduring legacy
of the Vincent Chin case

470
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,720
was that it managed to bring Asian
Americans of all ethnicities together

471
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,280
to call for justice.

472
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,960
And out of that sprang a new chapter

473
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,960
of Asian American activism
and political identity.

474
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,160
And that is just
the most famous example

475
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,720
of a rich history
of Asian American activism,

476
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,120
which has often worked
across racial lines,

477
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,040
from the student strike we mentioned
earlier, to Filipino labor leaders

478
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,880
working with Cesar Chavez
to organize a grape boycott,

479
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,280
to Yuri Kochiyama's friendship
with Malcolm X,

480
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,560
and her advocacy for marginalized
people of all backgrounds.

481
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,520
A prevailing narrative most people
hear regarding Asian Americans

482
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,400
is one of conflict between them
and other communities of color,

483
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,360
like during the 1992 L.A. uprising.

484
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,640
It's not that
those tensions aren't very real,

485
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,200
but it's not
the whole picture either.

486
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,280
It's also a narrative that fits
into a much larger pattern,

487
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,760
in which white America

488
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,760
has actively pitted Asian Americans
against other communities.

489
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,680
And that brings us
to the second half of this sentence,

490
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,840
and the "model minority" myth.

491
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,840
The idea of the model minority
emerged over half a century ago,

492
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,320
in part, because some Asian Americans
were type-casting themselves

493
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,560
in a bid to enhance
their demands for racial equality.

494
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,720
They did so by promoting
their communities

495
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,040
as upstanding and hardworking.

496
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:17,400
And as immigration law began selecting
for skilled and educated immigrants,

497
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:22,240
the credentials of those new arrivals
seemed to conform to the stereotype,

498
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,320
which then took on a life of its own,
especially in the civil rights era,

499
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,480
as whites unnerved by Black Americans'
radical challenges to the system,

500
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,920
held up Japanese and Chinese
Americans and their success

501
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,680
as evidence that they claimed
disproved systemic racism.

502
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,560
Basically, America prioritized wealthy,
more educated Asian immigrants,

503
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,560
then turned to Black people,
who'd been subjugated for centuries,

504
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,360
and said: "See ? They're educated and
successful, why aren't you ?"

505
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,360
Using Asian American success
to downplay American racism

506
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,400
is a trend that very much
continues to this day.

507
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,000
If America was
such a hate-filled, discriminatory,

508
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,760
racist society filled
with animus against Asian Americans,

509
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:10,120
how do you explain the remarkable
success of Asian Americans ?

510
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,840
Their mindset
is to just work really hard.

511
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,600
It's not to protest things
and not to shut things down.

512
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,440
The Asians,
the whole reason why they kick ass

513
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,960
is because they don't spend
any time on petty bullshit.

514
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,760
Asians are concerned
about hate crimes

515
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,240
but they're very upwardly mobile,
very success-oriented,

516
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,920
very business-oriented.

517
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,600
They're model citizens
in many cases in my view.

518
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,360
Probably the most admirable
ethnic group we have.

519
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,480
Congratulations,
Asian Americans !

520
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,120
Dick Morris thinks you're the most
admirable ethnic group we have.

521
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,880
That's so sweet of him to say.

522
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,160
If you want to write a thank you note,
just address the envelope

523
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,560
to "Shove This Right Up Dick Morris's
Ass, New York, NY,"

524
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,400
"Whatever ZIP Code
Dick Morris' Asshole Is In."

525
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,160
A central premise
of the model minority myth

526
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,480
is that the key
to overcoming American racism

527
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,280
is simply strong values
and hard work,

528
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,040
with the implication being
that groups that haven't succeeded,

529
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,160
simply haven't tried hard enough.

530
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,680
And putting aside
how offensive that is,

531
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,280
the truth is,
whether or not you're successful,

532
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,600
living a life defined by a racist
fantasy just isn't good for you.

533
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,680
Striving to maintain
the idea of a model minority

534
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,080
has severed my self-esteem.

535
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,440
It really makes me feel
that I'm nothing more

536
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,040
than someone
who could get good grades,

537
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,360
someone who was supposed to be
perfect and be mum about everything.

538
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:38,120
Trying to be perfect your whole life
is going to be too much to bear.

539
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,560
That is why I made a promise
when I started this show

540
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,600
that I'd always get one fact
in every story completely wrong.

541
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,800
Is that responsible ?
Absolutely not.

542
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,040
But it is what keeps me
looking young.

543
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,400
And the model minority myth
is especially galling

544
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,360
for some members of groups, like
those whose families came as refugees,

545
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,000
whose lived experience doesn't
remotely match the stereotype.

546
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,240
The truth is, that kind of pressure
can do real damage.

547
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,840
Suicide is the leading cause of death

548
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,760
for Asian Americans between
the ages of 15 and 24.

549
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,000
Only 8 percent of Asian Americans
sought help for their mental health,

550
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,360
which is less than half the rate
of the general population.

551
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,600
That is not just a result of cultural
stigmas around mental health.

552
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,720
It's also what happens
when you're consistently told

553
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,600
to quietly and happily
accept discrimination

554
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,120
because your version
is the "nice racism".

555
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,040
But there is no nice racism.
There is no silver lining to it

556
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,640
and there is no working
your way out of it.

557
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,480
You are still perpetually
treated as a foreigner,

558
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,400
still asked
where you're "really from"

559
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,960
and Asian Americans always seem
to be just one geopolitical crisis away

560
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,800
from becoming
the targets of violence yet again,

561
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,680
whether it's those internment
camps for Japanese Americans,

562
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,760
or the spate of attacks
on South Asians after 9/11

563
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,400
or all of the recent racial violence
during the pandemic.

564
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,000
So the model minority myth

565
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,000
is both a tool of white supremacy
and a trap.

566
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,320
As with so many things in this story,
with a community this diverse,

567
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,880
there are going to be different
perspectives on how to handle it.

568
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,000
Andrew Yang has annoyed
some by leaning into it,

569
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,240
with selfdeprecating jokes
and his fucking "math" hat.

570
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,400
He also angered many
when he responded

571
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,720
to the Trump administration's
"China virus" rhetoric

572
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,720
by writing
an op-ed in which he claimed:

573
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,600
"We Asian Americans need to embrace
and show our American-ness"

574
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,320
"in ways we never have before,"

575
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,400
by, among other things,
"wearing red white and blue".

576
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,160
That argument prompted a backlash,
with Eddie Huang tweeting:

577
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,720
"Fuck out of here with this America
drag... you bumbling pineapple bun".

578
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,560
And I do get that.
'Cause it's pretty insulting to suggest

579
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,400
centuries of racism could be defeated
by serving Uncle Sam realness.

580
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:55,160
So all of that is, very simplistically,
too broadly and probably too quickly,

581
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,680
an abridged version of how we
all got to where we are right now.

582
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,160
Where do we go from here ?
Well, what is clear is,

583
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,000
we have to find a way to have smarter,
more nuanced conversations

584
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,920
about the reality
of the Asian American experience.

585
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,920
We cannot do that without access
to high quality, disaggregated data

586
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,920
that can help better fit public policy

587
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,720
to the actual needs
of individual communities.

588
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,040
But that is not all.

589
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,960
Asian Americans have been warning
for decades about all of this.

590
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,200
Watch a man tell a reporter,
five years before I was even born,

591
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,800
what I've been trying to tell you
tonight, during yet another one

592
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,440
of those old
"model minority" profiles.

593
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,440
I suggested that compared
to the Black and the Chicano,

594
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,360
the Japanese American has it made.
He can get a job, a place to live.

595
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,560
It's a situation where I think
the question is not material,

596
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,320
making it in terms of economics,
but a question of human dignity.

597
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,040
You know what I mean
in terms of human dignity ?

598
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,520
We've been set in a certain
category and many people argue:

599
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,320
"You got a good stereotype !"

600
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,360
You got a stereotype that gets you
apartments where you don't have to pay

601
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,320
a cleaning deposit because
you're so goddamn clean !

602
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,920
That's our stereotype,
but it's an infringement,

603
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,520
it's a violation of our human dignity

604
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,320
'cause they don't view us
as individuals, as human beings.

605
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,320
We fit into a certain category,
a certain box, that's how they view us.

606
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,720
He's right. It's a category,
it's a box, but the thing is,

607
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,400
you don't learn anything from it
unless you bother to look inside.

608
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,200
Because obviously, no group,
community, or indeed individual,

609
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,480
is just one thing.

610
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,160
When you reduce the Asian American
experience to that of a model minority

611
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,800
you are omitting a history that
includes exploitation and exclusion,

612
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,360
but also includes activism,
some infighting,

613
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,720
challenges with issues
like immigration, education,

614
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,320
and access to social services
that continue to this day,

615
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,800
and interests and achievements
that go far beyond these two guys,

616
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,720
to be as vast and diverse
as America itself.

617
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,800
By the way: can you see
who's in there ? I told you, Kareem !

618
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,080
I told you I got your back !
I see you, Kareem !

619
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,120
I know this story has barely
skimmed the surface of this subject,

620
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,960
but I hope that it's at least
introduced some of you

621
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,160
to a bit
of the history involved here,

622
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:08,840
as well as what I think we can all
agree is the world's most fuckable bee.

623
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,800
That's our show. Thanks for watching.
We'll see you next week, good night !
