IT'S BEEN LISTENING A LOT TO ME,

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
SO I THOUGHT

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I WOULD GIVE IT THE FLOOR FOR A

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000

HE IS TRYING TO RIDE OUT, TRYING

63
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000

I DO KISS PEOPLE ON THE CHEEK.

67
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I DO KISS PEOPLE ON THE HAND.

68
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I DO EMBRACE PEOPLE.

69
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I DO HUG PEOPLE, MEN AND WOMEN.

71
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS

72
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,000
ABOUT.

73
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
AND IT'S FRANKLY INCREDIBLE THAT

74
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
CUOMO THOUGHT RELEASING AN

75
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
IRRELEVANT MONTAGE OF PHOTOS

76
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
WOULD SOMEHOW EXONERATE HIM.

77
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
APPARENTLY HIS STRATEGY FOR

78
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
LITERALLY ANY CRISIS IS

79
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
"PUT TOGETHER A POWERPOINT AND

80
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
THAT'S IT."

81
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
BUT THE REST OF THE WORLD'S

82
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,000
ATTENTION WAS DOMINATED THIS

83
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
WEEK BY THE OLYMPICS.

84
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
THEY ENDED TONIGHT AND THEY

85
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
PROVIDED SOME INCREDIBLE MOMENTS

86
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
FROM THE ATHLETES, BUT ALSO SOME

87
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
CONTROVERSY FROM THE FACT

88
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
THE GAMES WERE EVEN HAPPENING IN

89
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,000

91
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
TAKEN BEFORE THEY BEGAN

92
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
REGARDING ONE OF THE TEAMS

93
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
INVOLVED.

94
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
>> IN OTHER OLYMPIC NEWS THIS

95
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,000
MORNING, RUSSIA IS COMPETING

96
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
UNDER A NEW NAME AT THESE

97
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
OLYMPICS FOLLOWING THEIR DOPING

98
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
SCANDAL.

99
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
THEY'LL BE COMPETING AS THE

100
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
"RUSSIAN OLYMPIC COMMITTEE."

101
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
THE RUSSIAN NAME, FLAG, AND

102
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
ANTHEM HAVE ALL BEEN BANNED IF

103
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
ATHLETES DO WIN ANY MEDALS.

104
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
>> John: YEAH, THOUGH THE

105
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
RUSSIAN NAME ISN'T REALLY BANNED

106
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
IF THEY'RE COMPETING AS THE

107
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
"RUSSIAN" OLYMPIC COMMITTEE, IS

108
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
IT?

109
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
IT'S LIKE SAYING, "A MONSTER

110
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
LIKE HARVEY WEINSTEIN HAS

111
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
ABSOLUTELY NO AFFILIATION WITH

112
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY."

113
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I DUNNO ABOUT THAT.

114
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
THE NAME THERE REALLY IMPLIES

115
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
OTHERWISE.

116
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
THE NEW DESIGNATION IS DUE TO

117
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
THE FACT THAT RUSSIA WAS

118
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
TECHNICALLY BANNED FOR OPERATING

119
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
A YEARS-LONG, STATE-SPONSORED

120
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
DOPING SCHEME, AND THIS ISN'T

121
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE BEEN

122
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
SANCTIONED.

123
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
IN PYEONGCHANG IN 2018, RUSSIAN

124
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
ATHLETES HAD TO COMPETE UNDER

125
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
THIS NEUTRAL BANNER INSTEAD OF

126
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
THEIR FLAG.

127
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
BUT BEFORE TOKYO, THE PUNISHMENT

128
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
WAS DOWNGRADED, AND THEY WERE

129
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
ALLOWED TO COMPETE AS THE

130
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
"RUSSIAN OLYMPIC COMMITTEE" WITH

131
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
UNIFORMS THAT CLEARLY BEAR MORE

132
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
THAN A PASSING RESEMBLANCE TO

133
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
THE RUSSIAN FLAG.

134
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
WE ALL KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON

135
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
THERE, IN THE SAME WAY THAT

136
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
CALLING THIS A RED PLUMBER

137
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
HALLOWEEN COSTUME ISN'T FOOLING

138
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
ANYONE.

139
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
AND WHILE WINNING RUSSIAN

140
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
ATHLETES DIDN'T GET TO HEAR

141
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
THEIR NATIONAL ANTHEM ON THE

142
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
MEDAL STAND, THEY DID GET THIS:

146
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
YEAH, THEY GOT TCHAIKOVSKY.

147
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
THAT IS MORE RUSSIAN THAN THE

148
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
RUSSIAN NATIONAL ANTHEM.

149
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
IN FACT, THERE IS NO SOUND MORE

150
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
QUINTESSENTIALLY RUSSIAN, ASIDE

EMBRACED THE R.O.C. DESIGNATION

156
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
"R.O.C." AS A FUN, SASSY NAME!

162
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR

163
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
PUNISHMENT.

164
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
IT'S LIKE IF HANNIBAL LECTER

165

MUZZLE.

170
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
THE THING IS, THESE

171
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
DESIGNATIONS WERE PUT IN PLACE

172
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
FOR A REASON -- BUT THAT REASON

173
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
IS NOT SOMETHING THE R.O.C.'S

174
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
BEEN EAGER TO ACKNOWLEDGE.

175
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000

ATHLETE HAD WON THAT RACE --

179
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
RESPONDED AGGRESSIVELY:

181
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
WHETHER PEOPLE LIKE IT OR NOT."

190
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
>> John: WOW.

191
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
THAT IS A HARD PUSHBACK.

192
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
AND THE R.O.C. WAS VERY MUCH NOT

193
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
DONE, CALLING THE COMPLAINTS

194
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
"ENGLISH-LANGUAGE PROPAGANDA,

195
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
OOZING VERBAL SWEAT IN

196
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
THE TOKYO HEAT."

197
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
WHICH IS UNDENIABLY POETIC.

198
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
"OOZING VERBAL SWEAT IN THE

199
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
TOKYO HEAT" SOUNDS LESS LIKE

200
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
RUSSIAN TOUGH TALK AND MORE LIKE

201
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
A LINE FROM "A STREETCAR NAMED

202
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
DESIRE 2: BLANCHE GOES EAST."

203
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT MAKING

204
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
RUSSIA COMPETE UNDER A

205
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
SUPPOSEDLY "NEUTRAL" FLAG AND

206
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
UNIFORMS, WHEN NEITHER THE FLAG

207
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
NOR THE UNIFORMS WERE NEUTRAL,

208
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
MEANS THAT THIS PUNISHMENT

209
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
WASN'T REALLY A PUNISHMENT AT

210
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
ALL.

211
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
SO LET'S TRY AND LEARN FROM

212
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
THIS, AND NEXT TIME THIS PROBLEM

213
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
ARISES, LET'S MAKE SURE BANNED

214
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
COUNTRIES HAVE A MUCH CLEARER

215
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
ASTERISK ON THEIR PARTICIPATION.

216
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
SO INSTEAD OF A OBVIOUSLY

217
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
FLAG-THEMED TRACKSUIT, LET'S

218
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
PUT THEM IN A SHREK-THEMED

219
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
SWEATSHIRT PAIRED WITH

220
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
SHIT EMOJI SLIPPERS AND A

221
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
LOBSTER HAT.

222
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

223
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
SEE?

224
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
NOW THAT IS A NEUTRAL LOOK.

225
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
GOOD LUCK GUESSING WHAT NATION

226
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
THAT ATHLETE IS COMPETING FOR

227
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
FROM THAT OUTFIT.

228
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
AND WHEN THEIR ATHLETES WIN

229
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
GOLD, DON'T GIVE THEM SOMETHING

230
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
THAT INSPIRES NATIONAL PRIDE

231
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
LIKE TCHAIKOVSKY.

232
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
INSTEAD, PLAY SOMETHING AWFUL

233
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
THAT'S GUARANTEED TO STICK IN

234
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
YOUR HEAD AND REMIND YOU THAT

235
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
SOMETHING OBJECTIONABLE HAS

236
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
HAPPENED.

237
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
MAY I SUGGEST THIS:

238
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
>> ♪ 1 877 KARS 4 KIDS ♪

243
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
OF BUT LET'S AGREE,

244
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
IT IS THE ULTIMATE

245
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
DETERRENT.

246
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
AND NOW THIS.

247
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
>> Announcer: AND NOW, THE

>> WELCOME TO "DAYTIME."

253

IT'S MONDAY.

254
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
>> IT IS MONDAY.

255
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
>> HOLLA!

256
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
HELLO.

257
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
HOW WAS YOUR WEEKEND?

258
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
>> BUSY BUT GOOD.

259
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
>> HOW ARE YOU?

260
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
>> I AM GOOD.

261
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
YOURSELF?

262
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
>> DOING GOOD.

263
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
HOW ARE YOU?

264
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
>> GOOD.

265
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,000
CHILLING.

266
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
ANOTHER DAY.

267
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
>> WHAT IS UP?

268
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED HOW SMART

269
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
YOUR DOG IS?

270
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,000
>> YEAH.

271
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,000
>> AIRING MOVIES YOU CAN'T

272
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
NECESSARILY SEE AT THE THEATERS.

273
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
WE ARE READY, WE ARE IN THIS

274
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
SPIRIT.

275
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,000
>> YEP.

276
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
WE ARE.

277
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
>> THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE

278
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
SHOWS WE DO EVERY SINGLE YEAR.

279
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
>> I THINK IT'S...

280
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
FUN.

281
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
>> DOING GOOD.

282
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
DOING REAL GOOD.

283
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
>> ALL RIGHTS.

284
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
>> HOW ARE YOU DOING.

285
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
>> GOOD.

286
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
>> NOT A LOT OF CHANGE FROM

287
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,000
YESTERDAY.

288
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
IT'S GOOD MORNING.

289
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
>> HOW WAS THE DAY?

290
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
GOOD?

291
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
>> AGAIN, GOOD.

292
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
>> John: MOVING ON.

293
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

294
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,000
A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT'S

295
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
EXPOSED THE FAILURE OF AMERICAN

296
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
INSTITUTIONS.

297
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
NO, NOT THAT ONE.

298
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000
NOT THAT ONE EITHER.

299
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,000
THAT'S A GOOD POINT, BUT NOT

300
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
ACTUALLY THIS TIME.

301
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
YEP, THERE IT IS.

302
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,000
THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC.

303
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "HOLD

304
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
ON, DIDN'T YOU ALREADY DO A SHOW

305
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
ABOUT THIS?"

306
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
YOU'RE WRONG.

307
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
WE'VE ACTUALLY DONE TWO OF THEM,

308
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,000
BUT WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WORTH

309
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
DOING A THIRD INSTALLMENT

310
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
TONIGHT FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS.

311
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
FIRST, IT'S AN EPIDEMIC THAT'S

312
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
STILL VERY MUCH RAGING,

313
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
EXACERBATED BY BOTH THE PANDEMIC

314
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
AND ILLICIT FENTANYL, TO THE

315
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
POINT THAT LAST YEAR, NEARLY

316
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
70,000 PEOPLE DIED FROM OPIOID

317
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
OVERDOSES.

318
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,000
THAT IS THE HIGHEST ANNUAL DEATH

319
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
TOLL EVER.

320
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
AND SECOND, YOU MAY HAVE SEEN A

321
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
BUNCH OF HEADLINES RECENTLY

322
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
ABOUT TRIALS AND SETTLEMENTS

323
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
TAKING PLACE AROUND THE COUNTRY.

324
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
THERE'VE BEEN SO MANY, IT CAN BE

325
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
GENUINELY BE HARD TO KEEP TRACK.

326
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
BUT WE WANT TO FOCUS ON JUST ONE

327
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
COMPANY TONIGHT: PURDUE PHARMA,

328
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
WHOSE ROLLOUT OF OXYCONTIN

329
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
ARGUABLY FUELED THE OPIOID

330
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
CRISIS.

331
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THEIR

332
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
RELENTLESS PUSH TO SELL

333
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
OXYCONTIN BEFORE, BUT MORE

334
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
MATERIAL HAS COME OUT IN THE

335
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS --

336
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000

357
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
THAT WAS PURDUE'S VP OF SALES

358
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
PERFORMING AN OXY-THEMED COVER

359
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
OF "SHOUT!"

360
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
AND THAT HAS GOT TO BE THE ONE

361
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
OF THE MOST UPSETTING DECISIONS

362
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
FROM THE LATE '90s, RIGHT UP

363
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
THERE WITH, "GIVE EVERY LONELY

372
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
PURDUE PHARMA IS OWNED BY THE

373
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
SACKLER FAMILY, AND IN RECENT

374
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000

HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES BEING

376
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
INVESTIGATED BY THE DOJ AND

377
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
FACING THOUSANDS OF LAWSUITS

378
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
FILED BY STATE AND LOCAL

379
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
GOVERNMENTS, NATIVE AMERICAN

380
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
TRIBES, HOSPITALS, AND

381
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
INDIVIDUALS.

382
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
AND THEY'VE SPENT YEARS WORKING

383
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
WITH AN ARMY OF LAWYERS,

384
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
ATTEMPTING TO NEGOTIATE THEIR

385
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
WAY OUT OF ALL OF IT, WHICH HAS

386
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
RESULTED IN TWO MAJOR

387
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
RESOLUTIONS, INCLUDING THIS BIG

388
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
NEWS FROM LAST OCTOBER.

389
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
>> IT'S BEING HAILED BY THE

390
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS A MAJOR

391
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
VICTORY AGAINST A COMPANY WHOSE

392
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
DRUG OXYCONTIN IS PART OF THE

393
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS OF OPIOID

394
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
ADDICTION THAT HAS LED TO THE

395
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
DEATHS OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

396
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
OF AMERICANS.

397
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
>> THE MAKER OF OXYCONTIN

398
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
ADMITTED TO DEFRAUDING

399
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
REGULATORS AND PAYING ILLEGAL

400
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
KICKBACKS TO DOCTORS.

401
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
>> John: IT'S TRUE!

402
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
PURDUE HAS PLED GUILTY TO

403
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
MULTIPLE FELONIES.

404
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
AND IT'S WEIRD TO HEAR NEWS THAT

405
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
SOUNDS SO GENUINELY GOOD.

406
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
IT'D BE REALLY NICE TO GET MORE

407
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
OF THAT ONCE IN A WHILE, LIKE

408
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
"NO ONCE-IN-A-CENTURY WEATHER

409
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
EVENTS FOR THE NEXT FEW HOURS,"

410
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
OR "BILLIONAIRE GOES TO SPACE

411
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
AND DIES THERE."

412
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING

413
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
HEARTWARMING.

414
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
THAT GUILTY PLEA WAS ACTUALLY

415
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
PART OF A MUCH LARGER PLAN WE'LL

416
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
GET INTO LATER, INVOLVING THE

417
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
COMPANY ALSO FILING FOR

418
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
BANKRUPTCY, AND JUST THIS PAST

419
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
MARCH, SUBMITTING A

420
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
REORGANIZATION PLAN THAT WOULD

421
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
END SACKLER OWNERSHIP.

422
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
AND THE THING IS, THIS MIGHT ALL

423
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
SOUND LIKE A MAJOR VICTORY --

424
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
THAT THE SACKLERS ARE FINALLY

425
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT

426
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
CONSEQUENCES -- BUT

427
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT COULDN'T BE

428
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
FARTHER FROM THE TRUTH.

429
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
SO TONIGHT, WITH THE

430
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
BANKRUPTCY'S CONFIRMATION

431
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
HEARING SCHEDULED TO BEGIN LATER

432
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
THIS WEEK, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

433
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
SACKLER FAMILY -- HOW HARD

434
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
THEY'VE BEEN FIGHTING TO DEFEND

435
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
THEIR NAME, THE DETAILS OF THE

436
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
DEAL THEY'RE ATTEMPTING TO

437
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
STRIKE, AND WHY THE WHOLE THING

438
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
IS A BUNCH OF BULLSHIT.

439
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
AND LET'S START WITH A BASIC

440
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
QUESTION: WHO ARE THE SACKLERS?

441
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
WELL, THE SACKLERS ARE THE

442
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
DESCENDANTS OF THREE BROTHERS --

443
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
ARTHUR, RAYMOND, AND MORTIMER --

444
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
WHO IN 1952 BOUGHT THE COMPANY

445
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY BECOME

446
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
PURDUE PHARMA.

447
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
AND WHILE ARTHUR'S BRANCH OF THE

448
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
FAMILY SOLD THEIR STAKE DECADES

449
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
AGO, BEFORE OXYCONTIN WAS

450
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
DEVELOPED, THE HEIRS OF RAYMOND

451
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
AND MORTIMER BOTH BENEFITED

452
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
FROM, AND IN SOME CASES ACTIVELY

453
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
MANAGED, PURDUE'S BOOM YEARS OF

454
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
SELLING OPIOIDS.

455
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
MANY SACKLERS EITHER WORKED AT

456
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
THE COMPANY OR SERVED ON ITS

457
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
BOARD, AND AS THE MASSACHUSETTS

458
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
A.G. POINTS OUT, SOME OF THEM

459
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
WERE PRETTY HANDS-ON.

460
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,000
>> THEY WERE IN THE BOARDROOM.

461
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
THEY OWNED THE COMPANY.

462
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
WE HAVE EMAILS AND MEMOS THAT

463
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
SHOW THE DIRECT CONTROL THAT

464
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
THEY EXERCISED OVER SALES AND

465
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
MARKETING.

466
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
ONE OF THE SACKLER FAMILY

467
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
MEMBERS WENT SO FAR AS TO WANT

468
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
TO GET IN THE CAR WITH PURDUE'S

469
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
SALES REPS AND DRIVE AROUND TO

470
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,000
VISIT DOCTORS' OFFICES.

471
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
>> John: IT'S TRUE, AND DOING A

472
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
DRUG REP RIDE-ALONG IS ABOUT AS

473
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
HANDS-ON AS YOU CAN GET.

474
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,000
AND QUICK SIDE NOTE, SPARE A

475
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
THOUGHT FOR THE SALES REP IN

476
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,000
QUESTION THERE.

477
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
SURE, THEY TOO CONTRIBUTED TO

478
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
THE OVER-PRESCRIPTION OF AMERICA

479
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
AND PROBABLY LED TO THEIR OWN

480
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
LOCAL MINI-EPIDEMIC, BUT

481
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
NOBODY -- NOT EVEN HITLER --

482
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
SHOULD HAVE TO SIT IN A CAR WITH

483
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
THEIR BOSS.

484
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
AND TALK ABOUT WHAT?

485
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
THE WEATHER?

486
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
AND THEN, WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF

487
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
THINGS TO SAY ABOUT IT, DO WHAT?

488
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
SIT IN SILENCE?

489
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
AND THEN SAY, "ACTUALLY, I COULD

490
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
GO FOR A BATHROOM BREAK RIGHT

491
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
NOW," AND HAVE HIM SAY, "I'M

492
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
FINE, BUT FEEL FREE TO STOP?"

493
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
AND THEN, WHAT -- YOU STOP?

494
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
AND HE WAITS IN THE CAR?

495
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
AND THEN WHEN YOU GET BACK HE

496
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
LOOKS INCONVENIENCED?

497
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I WOULD SOONER THROW MYSELF OUT

498
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,000
OF THE CAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

499
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,000
FREEWAY.

500
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
NOW, THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR

501
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
THAT RIDE-ALONG WAS RICHARD

502
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
SACKLER, WHO WAS ACTUALLY

503
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY FOR

504
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
YEARS.

505
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
AND YET, INTERESTINGLY, IT'S

506
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
HARD TO FIND IMAGES OF HIM OTHER

507
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
THAN THAT ONE.

508
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
IN FACT, WHILE THE SACKLERS HAVE

509
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
RELISHED SLAPPING THEIR FAMILY

510
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
NAME ON INSTITUTIONS, AS

511
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
INDIVIDUALS, THEY'VE TRIED TO

512
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
STAY OUT OF THE SPOTLIGHT.

513
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
WHEN RICHARD SACKLER GAVE A

514
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
DEPOSITION IN 2015, PURDUE

515
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
FOUGHT HARD TO KEEP IT PRIVATE.

516
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
THAT'S WHY, IN OUR LAST PIECE,

517
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
WE HAD A BUNCH OF ACTORS PLAY

518
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
HIM TO CONVEY IMPORTANT THINGS

519
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
LIKE THE FACT HE'D SAID "I DON'T

520
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
KNOW" MORE THAN 100 TIMES.

521
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
THANKFULLY, THAT DEPOSITION HAS

522
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
SINCE BEEN RELEASED, SO YOU CAN

523
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
FINALLY WATCH THE MAN IN ACTION.

524
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
>> HOW MUCH MONEY HAS PURDUE

525
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
FREDERICK OR PURDUE PHARMA MADE

526
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
OFF THE SALE OF OXYCONTIN?

527
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
>> I DON'T KNOW.

528
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I DON'T KNOW.

529
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER.

530
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I DON'T KNOW.

531
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I DON'T KNOW BUT -- I JUST DON'T

532
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
KNOW.

533
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
>> John: ADMIT IT --

534
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
THE GUY JUST OOZES CHARISMA.

535
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,000
ALTHOUGH HONESTLY?

536
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
HAVING ACTUALLY SEEN IT, I THINK

537
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I PREFER THE VERSION WE MADE:

538
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
>> HOW MUCH MONEY HAS PURDUE

539
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
FREDERICK OR PURDUE PHARMA MADE

540
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
OFF THE SALE OF OXYCONTIN?

541
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
>> I DUNNO.

542
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I DUNNO.

543
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I DON'T KNOW.

544
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I DON'T KNOW.

545
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I DON'T KNOW.

546
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
>> HOW MANY PURDUE ENTITIES ARE

547
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,000
THERE?

548
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
>> I DUNNO!

549
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S JUST

550
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
OBJECTIVELY BETTER.

551
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
NOW, WHILE RICHARD WAS THE MOST

552
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
INVOLVED, HE WASN'T ALONE.

553
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
HIS COUSIN KATHE SACKLER WAS AN

554
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
OFFICER OF THE COMPANY FOR YEARS

555
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
AND EVEN CLAIMED IN EMAILS THAT

556
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
DEVELOPING OXYCONTIN WAS HER

557
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
IDEA.

558
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
ALTHOUGH, DESPITE THAT, WHEN

559
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
KATHE WAS CALLED BEFORE CONGRESS

560
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
LAST YEAR AND ASKED TO APOLOGIZE

561
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
FOR HER ROLE IN THE OPIOID

562
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
CRISIS, SHE DIDN'T EXACTLY DO

563
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
THAT.

564
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
>> I HAVE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT,

565
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
WAS -- IS THERE ANYTHING THAT I

566
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
COULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY

567
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
KNOWING WHAT I KNEW THEN, NOT

568
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
WHAT I KNOW NOW.

569
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I HAVE TO SAY, I CAN'T -- THERE

570
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
IS NOTHING THAT I CAN FIND THAT

571
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY.

572
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, THAT'S NOT

573
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
AN APOLOGY, KATHE.

574
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
AND SECOND, COME ON -- NEARLY A

575
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
YEAR INTO A PANDEMIC, THAT'S AN

576
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
UNACCEPTABLE AT-HOME SETUP.

577
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
PUT YOUR LAPTOP ON A COUPLE

578
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
BOOKS.

579
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
UPGRADE YOUR ROUTER.

580
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,

581
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
ONE-CLICK A RING LIGHT.

582
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
SO, KATHE, THAT'S BOOKS, ROUTER,

583
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,000
RING LIGHT.

584
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
IT'S THE LITTLE ZOOM TRICKS

585
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
WE'VE ALL LEARNED THAT'LL HELP

586
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
YOU LOOK YOUR BEST AS YOU

587
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
ABSOLVE YOURSELF OF

588
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
RESPONSIBILITY FOR A MASSIVE

589
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS.

590
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
BUT THE SACKLERS HAVEN'T JUST

591
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
BEEN APPEARING AT CONGRESSIONAL

592
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
HEARINGS.

593
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
SOME HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD TO

594
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
REHABILITATE THEIR IMAGE AND

595
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
EVEN PAINT THEMSELVES AS

596
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
VICTIMS.

597
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
TAKE DAVID SACKLER.

598
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
HE'S RICHARD'S SON AND A FORMER

599
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,000
BOARD MEMBER HIMSELF.

600
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
HE GAVE AN INTERVIEW TO

601
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,000
"VANITY FAIR" FEATURING THIS

602
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,000
PORTRAIT, WHICH LOOKS LIKE IT

603
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
SHOULD BE A POSTER FOR

604
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
NATURAL FAMILY PLANNING IN A

605
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
CHRISTIAN HEALTH CLINIC.

606
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
AND IN IT, HE COMPLAINED,

607
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
"MY FOUR-YEAR-OLD CAME HOME FROM

608
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
NURSERY SCHOOL AND ASKED,

609
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
'WHY ARE MY FRIENDS TELLING ME

610
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
THAT OUR FAMILY'S WORK IS

611
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
KILLING PEOPLE?'" WHICH DOESN'T

612
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
SEEM REMOTELY CREDIBLE.

613
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
FOR A START, EVERYONE KNOWS

614
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
THAT'S NOT HOW FOUR-YEAR-OLDS

615
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
TALK.

616
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
YOU'RE MISSING 8 "UMS,"

617
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
15 "AND, AND, ANDS," 3 TIMES

618
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
THEY'RE COMPLETELY OUT OF BREATH

619
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
FOR NO REASON, AND 5 COMPLETE

620
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
TRAIL-OFFS.

621
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I CALL BULLSHIT ON THAT FAKE

622
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
ANECDOTE.

623
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING.

624
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
DAVID'S BRANCH OF THE FAMILY WAS

625
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
ALSO INVOLVED IN THE LAUNCH OF A

626
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
PRO-SACKLER WEBSITE THAT AIMS TO

627
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
"CORRECT THE RECORD," CALLED

628
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
JudgeForYourselves.info,

629
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
WHICH IS SHOCKING FOR A NUMBER

630
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
OF REASONS.

631
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
FIRST, BECAUSE BILLIONAIRES, FOR

632
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
SOME REASON, CHOSE NOT TO

633
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
SPLURGE FOR THE DOT-COM, BUT

634
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
ALSO BECAUSE OF JUST HOW PETTY

635
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
THE WEBSITE IS.

636
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
IT FEATURES A LIST OF OUTLETS

637
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
THAT MISTAKENLY USED THE BRAND

638
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
NAME "OXYCONTIN" WHEN THEY MEANT

639
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
THE GENERIC "OXYCODONE,"

640
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
INCLUDING A COLLEGE NEWSPAPER,

641
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
AND OVER SEVEN HOURS OF VIDEO

642
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
PRESENTATIONS IN WHICH A

643
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
CATASTROPHICALLY UNCHARISMATIC

644
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
LAWYER ATTEMPTS TO DISPROVE

645
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
EVERY LEGAL ARGUMENT EVER MADE

646
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
AGAINST THE SACKLERS AND PURDUE.

647
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
THIS TERRIBLE WEBSITE OF

648
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
SELF-SERVING NONSENSE HAS BEEN

649
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
PROMOTED BY, AMONG OTHERS,

650
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
JOSS SACKLER, DAVID'S WIFE, WHO

651
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
YOU MAY REMEMBER FROM HER

652
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
FAILURE TO FACE THE CAMERA IN

653
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
"VANITY FAIR."

654
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
NOW, EVEN THOUGH JOSS ISN'T

655
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE FAMILY

656
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
BUSINESS, SHE ACTUALLY TALKS

657
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,000
PUBLICLY MORE THAN MOST

658
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,000
SACKLERS.

659
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
SHE HAS A CLOTHING LINE CALLED

660
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
"LBV," OR "LES BOULEDOGUES

661
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,000
VIGNERONNES," WHICH TRANSLATES

662
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
TO "THE WINEMAKING BULLDOGS" AND

663
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
IS AN OFFSHOOT OF HER

664
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,000
"MEMBERS-ONLY WINE AND SOCIAL

665
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,000
CLUB."

666
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
JOSS WAS ALSO ONCE INTERVIEWED

667
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
FOR "TOWN & COUNTRY," IN WHICH

668
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
SHE COMPLAINED ABOUT HOW

669
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
UNFAIRLY THE PRESS TREATS BOTH

670
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
HER AND HER FAMILY, NOTING

671
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
THAT A PREVIOUS ARTICLE

672
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
WOULDN'T REFER TO HER AS

673
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
DR. JOSS SACKLER, DESPITE HER

674
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
TELLING THEM SHE HAD A Ph.D. IN

675
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
LINGUISTICS, GOING ON TO SAY,

676
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
"THEY'RE GOING TO REGRET FUCKING

677
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
WITH A LINGUIST."

678
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
AND THAT'S ONE HELL OF A CLAIM,

679
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
JOSS.

680
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
BECAUSE NOBODY IS INTIMIDATED BY

681
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
LINGUISTS.

682
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
YOU'RE BASICALLY AN ENGLISH

683
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
MAJOR WHO WASTED MORE TIME.

684
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'LL FUCK WITH A LINGUIST ALL

685
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
DAY LONG.

686
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'LL SHOW YOU: HOW DO YOU MAKE

687
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
TWO PROPER NOUNS INTO A DOUBLE

688
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,000
NEGATIVE?

689
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
JOSS AND DAVID.

690
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
BOOM!

691
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
LINGUIST, FUCKED WITH.

692
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
SO TO RECAP, IT'S PRETTY CLEAR:

693
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
SOME SACKLERS HAVE BEEN WORKING

694
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
EXTREMELY HARD TO TRY AND

695
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
ENGENDER PUBLIC SYMPATHY.

696
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
BUT THE REAL BATTLE THE FAMILY'S

697
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
BEEN FIGHTING HAS BEEN A LEGAL

698
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
ONE.

699
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
AND THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO SPEND

700
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
THE REST OF THIS PIECE TALKING

701
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
ABOUT, BECAUSE WHILE THE DETAILS

702
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
OF WHAT THE SACKLERS ARE DOING

703
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
ARE INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED, THE

704
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
END RESULT IS BOTH SIMPLE AND

705
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
ABSOLUTELY INFURIATING.

706
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
AND LET'S START WITH THAT DEAL

707
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
YOU HEARD ABOUT EARLIER, WHERE

708
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
PURDUE PLED GUILTY TO THREE

709
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
FELONIES.

710
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
IT SOUNDED LIKE SOME GOOD NEWS.

711
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
BUT THERE ARE SOME MAJOR

712
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
ASTERISKS THERE, BECAUSE WHILE

713
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
THE COMPANY PLED GUILTY TO THOSE

714
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
CHARGES, NO INDIVIDUALS DID --

715
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
AND CERTAINLY NO SACKLERS.

716
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
AND THAT ALONE IS A BIG DEAL TO

717
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
THEM.

718
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
IN FACT, JUST WATCH AS KATHE

719
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
JUMPED TO REMIND EVERYONE OF

720
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
THAT FACT DURING HER

721
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
CONGRESSIONAL HEARING.

722
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
>> THE SACKLER FAMILY, THROUGH

723
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
PURDUE, HAS THREE FELONY

724
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
CONVICTIONS, BUT NO ONE'S IN

725
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
JAIL AND IT HAS ITS BILLIONS

726
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
STILL.

727
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
>> EXCUSE ME, THE SACKLER FAMILY

728
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
DOESN'T HAVE A FELONY

729
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
CONVICTION.

730
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
PURDUE PHARMA HAS A FELONY

731
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
CONVICTION.

732
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'M AN INDIVIDUAL PERSON.

733
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
>> John: OKAY, HOLD ON.

734
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I DO GET THE POINT SHE'S MAKING,

735
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,000
BUT THE FACT IS, PURDUE IS MADE

736
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
UP OF INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE WHO

737
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,000
CONTROL IT.

738
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
THINK OF PURDUE LIKE LAMBCHOP.

739
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,000
IF LAMBCHOP THREATENED TO KILL

740
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
THE PRESIDENT ON LIVE TV,

741
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
LAMBCHOP WOULDN'T GET IN TROUBLE

742
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
OR GO TO PRISON.

743
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
SHARI LEWIS WOULD.

744
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
WHY?

745
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
BECAUSE LAMBCHOP IS A PUPPET

746
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
WHO DOES WHATEVER THE FUCK

747
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
SHARI LEWIS TELLS LAMBCHOP

748
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,000
TO DO.

749
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
NOW, THE SACKLERS MIGHT ARGUE

750
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,000
THAT PURDUE WAS CONTROLLED BY

751
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
MANY PEOPLE -- INCLUDING

752
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
NON-FAMILY MEMBERS -- AND THAT

753
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
WHILE THEY'RE NOT FACING

754
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
CRIMINAL CHARGES, THEY'RE STILL

755
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,000
FACING CONSEQUENCES.

756
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
BUT HERE'S THE THING: ARE THEY?

757
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
REALLY?

758
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
AND THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THE

759
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
BANKRUPTCY I MENTIONED EARLIER.

760
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
BECAUSE THE BANKRUPTCY DEAL

761
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
PURDUE HAS PROPOSED IS THE

762
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
VEHICLE THROUGH WHICH THE

763
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
SACKLERS ARE LIKELY TO ESCAPE

764
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
ANY TRUE ACCOUNTABILITY.

765
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
VERY BASICALLY, PURDUE WAS

766
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
BURIED IN THOUSANDS OF LAWSUITS,

767
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
AND RATHER THAN FIGHTING THEM

768
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
ALL SEPARATELY, THE COMPANY

769
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY,

770
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
NEGOTIATING TO RESOLVE ALL ITS

771
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
DEBTS IN ONE PLACE.

772
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
THIS PROPOSED DEAL REQUIRES,

773
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE SACKLERS

774
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
RELINQUISH OWNERSHIP OF PURDUE,

775
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
WHICH WILL BE TURNED INTO A

776
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
"PUBLIC BENEFIT COMPANY," WHOSE

777
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
PROFITS WILL GO TOWARD FIGHTING

778
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC.

779
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
NOW, THE COMPANY CLAIMS THE

780
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,000
BANKRUPTCY WILL DELIVER MORE

781
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
THAN $10 BILLION IN VALUE.

782
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
BUT A FEW THINGS ABOUT THAT.

783
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
FIRST, THE SACKLERS THEMSELVES

784
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
ARE ONLY CONTRIBUTING AROUND

785
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
$4.3 BILLION TO THAT SETTLEMENT.

786
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
WHICH DOES SOUND LIKE A LOT

787
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
UNTIL YOU LEARN THE FAMILY HAS

788
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
ASSETS OF AROUND $11 BILLION,

789
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
WHICH IS A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF

790
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
MONEY, BUT I GUESS THAT'S WHAT

791
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
HAPPENS WHEN YOUR COMPANY MAKES

792
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
A HIGHLY ADDICTIVE PRODUCT AND

793
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
PUSHES ITS EMPLOYEES TO --

794
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
>> ♪ SELL OXYCONTIN! ♪

795
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
♪ MS CONTIN! ♪

796
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:14,000
♪ SELL! ♪

797
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
>> John: I JUST SAW THAT TEN

798
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
MINUTES AGO AND SOMEHOW IT'S

799
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
GOTTEN EVEN WORSE.

800
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
ALSO, YOU MIGHT WANT TO KNOW, A

801
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
LOT OF THE SACKLER FAMILY'S NET

802
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,000
WORTH WAS BUILT UP IN A

803
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
PARTICULAR PERIOD.

804
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
BECAUSE FROM 2008 TO 2017, EVEN

805
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
AS THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC WAS

806
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
KICKING INTO HIGH GEAR, MORE

807
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
THAN $10 BILLION WAS TRANSFERRED

808
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
OUT OF THE COMPANY FOR THE

809
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
BENEFIT OF THE FAMILY.

810
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
NOW, THE SACKLERS FIERCELY

811
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
MAINTAIN THOSE TRANSFERS WERE

812
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
PROPER.

813
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
BUT THE DOJ ALLEGED THAT THEY

814
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
WERE MADE TO HINDER FUTURE

815
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
CREDITORS -- IN OTHER WORDS, TO

816
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
GET THE MONEY OUT OF THE

817
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
COMPANY SO THE SACKLERS COULD

818
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
PROTECT IT -- AND THEY FOUND

819
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
SOME PRETTY DAMNING EVIDENCE,

820
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
PARTICULARLY FROM DAVID SACKLER,

821
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
WHO SEEMED TO DIRECTLY EXPRESS

822
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,000
FEARS OVER LAWSUITS TAKING THE

823
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
FAMILY MONEY BACK IN 2007,

824
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
WRITING IN AN EMAIL,

825
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
"WE'RE RICH?

826
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
FOR HOW LONG?

827
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
UNTIL WHICH SUITS GET THROUGH TO

828
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
THE FAMILY?"

829
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,000
AND DAVID, BUDDY, DON'T SEND

830
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
THAT KIND OF THING OVER EMAIL.

831
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I MEAN, DON'T SEND IT IN THE

832
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
MAIL-MAIL, DON'T SPEAK IT, DON'T

833
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
THINK IT, DON'T RECEIVE AN

834
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
UPBRINGING THAT WOULD PLANT THE

835
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
THOUGHT IN YOUR MIND, AND, IF

836
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
YOU COULD, JUST TRY AND AVOID

837
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
CONCEPTION ALTOGETHER.

838
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
BUT BARE MINIMUM, KEEP IT OUT OF

839
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
THE PERMANENT LEGAL RECORD.

840
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "OKAY,

841
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
SO, THEY TRANSFERRED MONEY TO

842
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
THE FAMILY.

843
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,000
BUT PEOPLE CAN STILL PURSUE

844
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
CLAIMS AGAINST THE SACKLERS

845
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
DIRECTLY, RIGHT?"

846
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
WELL, NO.

847
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
BECAUSE HERE'S THE REALLY

848
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
INSIDIOUS PART: WHILE THERE ARE

849
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
APPROXIMATELY 400 CIVIL SUITS

850
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
THAT DO NAME THE SACKLERS

851
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
THEMSELVES, THE FAMILY IS

852
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
INSISTING THAT THEY WILL ONLY

853
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
AGREE TO THIS SETTLEMENT IF THEY

854
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
GET WHAT'S CALLED A

855
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
NON-CONSENSUAL THIRD-PARTY

856
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
RELEASE.

857
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
AND THIS THING IS BULLSHIT.

858
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
BECAUSE IF THEY GET IT, ALL

859
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
CURRENT LAWSUITS AGAINST THE

860
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
SACKLERS EVAPORATE AND NO FUTURE

861
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
LAWSUITS CAN BE FILED.

862
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
MEANING THE SACKLERS --

863
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
WHO DIDN'T FILE FOR PERSONAL

864
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
BANKRUPTCY THEMSELVES,

865
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
REMEMBER -- ARE BASICALLY OFF

866
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,000
THE HOOK.

867
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
AND IF IT SOUNDS WEIRD TO YOU

868
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
THAT A COMPANY CAN DECLARE

869
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
BANKRUPTCY AND THEN A BUNCH OF

870
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
INDIVIDUALS GET SHIELDED FROM

871
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
LIABILITY, THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS!

872
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
IT'S REALLY FUCKING WEIRD!

873
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
IN FACT, SOME BANKRUPTCY COURTS

874
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
DON'T ALLOW THESE THIRD-PARTY

875
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
RELEASES AT ALL.

876
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
BUT PURDUE VERY CAREFULLY CHOSE

877
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
ONE THAT THEY KNEW PROBABLY

878
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
WOULD.

879
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
A FEW MONTHS BEFORE FILING FOR

880
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
BANKRUPTCY, PURDUE CHANGED ONE

881
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
OF ITS OFFICIAL CORPORATE

882
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
ADDRESSES TO ONE IN WHITE

883
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
PLAINS, NEW YORK, AT WHICH IT'S

884
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
NEVER CONDUCTED BUSINESS, AND

885
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
WHERE THERE IS ONLY ONE

886
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
BANKRUPTCY JUDGE, WHO --

887
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
COMPLETELY COINCIDENTALLY -- HAS

888
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
SUPPORTED THIRD-PARTY RELEASES

889
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
IN THE PAST.

890
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
WHICH IS ALL A PRETTY OBVIOUS

891
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
TACTIC.

892
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY MOVED TO

893
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
WHITE PLAINS FOR ANY OTHER

894
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
REASON.

895
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
IF YOU LOOK UP "THINGS TO DO IN

896
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
WHITE PLAINS" -- AND THIS IS

897
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
TRUE -- THE FIRST RESULT YOU GET

898
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
IS A TRIPADVISOR PAGE

899
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
RECOMMENDING A HELICOPTER TOUR

900
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
OF NEW YORK CITY.

901
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
WHICH IS JUST INCREDIBLE.

902
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
"COME VISIT WHITE PLAINS, WHERE

903
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,000
YOU CAN IMMEDIATELY LEAVE AND GO

904
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
LOOK AT SOMEWHERE MORE

905
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,000
INTERESTING TO LIVE."

906
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
AND THE SACKLERS' THIRD-PARTY

907
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,000
RELEASE IS COMPREHENSIVE,

908
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
STATING THAT THE RELEASED

909
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
PARTIES SHALL BE CONCLUSIVELY,

910
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
ABSOLUTELY, UNCONDITIONALLY,

911
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
IRREVOCABLY, FULLY, FINALLY,

912
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
FOREVER, AND PERMANENTLY

913
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
RELEASED FROM ANY AND ALL

914
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
CLAIMS, OF ANY KIND, FROM THE

915
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
BEGINNING OF TIME.

916
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
AND THIS IS THE LIST OF EVERY

917
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,000
PERSON AND ENTITY THEY WANT

918
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
COVERED.

919
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
IT CONTAINS OVER 200 COMPANIES

920
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
AND 200 MORE TRUSTS WHERE THE

921
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
SACKLERS HAVE TUCKED THEIR MONEY

922
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
AWAY.

923
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
THIS RELEASE IS LUDICROUSLY

924
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,000
BROAD, WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY

925
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
NINE STATE A.G.s ARE STILL

926
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
OBJECTING TO IT, AND TWO

927
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
BRANCHES OF THE DOJ HAVE SAID IT

928
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
VIOLATES THE U.S. CONSTITUTION

929
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
AND SPECIFICALLY VIOLATES DUE

930
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,000
PROCESS, BECAUSE IT DENIES

931
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
INDIVIDUALS OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO

932
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
BE HEARD, AND YET, INCREDIBLY,

933
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
DESPITE ALL THIS, IT'S WIDELY

934
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
ASSUMED THAT THIS WHOLE DEAL IS

935
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
GOING TO GO AHEAD.

936
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
AND WHILE IT SOUNDS TERRIBLE TO

937
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
ME, I WILL SAY, AT LEAST ONE

938
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
PERSON THINKS THAT'S A VERY GOOD

939
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
THING.

940
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, THAT ONE

941
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
PERSON IS PURDUE'S CURRENT

942
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,000
CHAIRMAN.

943
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
>> THIS IS A MILESTONE IN PUBLIC

944
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
HEALTH HISTORY.

945
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
NEVER BEFORE HAVE YOU SEEN THIS

946
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
AMOUNT OF MONEY, $10 BILLION

947
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
BEING DEVOTED TO OPIOID

948
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
ABATEMENT, AND IT'S ONLY

949
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
AVAILABLE THROUGH THIS PLAN,

950
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
ASSUMING WE CAN GET IT APPROVED.

951
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
AND I THINK WHEN PEOPLE THINK

952
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
ABOUT IT, THEY WILL COME AROUND

953
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
TO THE NOTION, "WELL, I MIGHT

954
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
HAVE LIKED SOMETHING SLIGHTLY

955
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
DIFFERENT, BUT THIS IS CERTAINLY

956
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
A LOT BETTER THAN GOING INTO

957
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
ENDLESS, COSTLY LITIGATION THAT

958
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
MAY END UP WITH NO PROCEEDS

959
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
GOING TO ANYBODY."

960
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
>> John: OKAY, NO.

961
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
"I MIGHT HAVE LIKED SOMETHING

962
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
DIFFERENT, BUT THIS IS BETTER

963
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
THAN NOTHING" IS WHAT YOU SAY

964
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
WHEN YOUR DAD INSISTS ON HAVING

965
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
DINNER AT CHILI'S, NOT WHEN

966
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FATE OF

967
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
A COMPANY THAT POISONED A

968
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
GENERATION.

969
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
WHICH, INCIDENTALLY, IS, I

970
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
BELIEVE, CHILI'S CURRENT SLOGAN.

971
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
AND HERE'S THE THING: THAT MAN'S

972
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
NOT EVEN ENTIRELY WRONG.

973
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
THE LONGER THESE LAWSUITS DRAG

974
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
ON, THE MORE MONEY WILL GET

975
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
WASTED IN COURT, AND AN

976
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
INCREASINGLY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF

977
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
IT WILL GO TO LAWYERS RATHER

978
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
THAN VICTIMS.

979
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, UNDER THIS

980
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
SETTLEMENT, CLAIMANTS COULD

981
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
RECEIVE PAYMENTS FROM $3,500 TO

982
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
$48,000.

983
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
WHICH, YES, FEELS WILDLY

984
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
INSUFFICIENT.

985
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
BUT SOME FAMILIES ARE

986
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
RELUCTANTLY WILLING TO TAKE WHAT

987
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
THEY CAN GET.

988
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY OTHERS, LIKE

989
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
THIS WOMAN -- WHOSE SON BECAME

990
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
ADDICTED TO OPIOIDS AFTER BEING

991
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
PRESCRIBED OXYCONTIN AS A HIGH

992
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
SCHOOL STUDENT -- ARE FURIOUS

993
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
THAT THIS IS WHAT IT'S COME TO.

994
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
>> WE WANT OUR VOICES HEARD, NOT

995
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
INTERPRETED BY THE COURT LIKE

996
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
THEY HAVE BEEN.

997
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I DON'T WANT SOMEBODY SAYING

998
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
THAT I LOVE -- I'M SO HAPPY WITH

999
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
THE SETTLEMENT AS I HEAR AT

1000
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
PRACTICALLY EVERY HEARING.

1001
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'M A MOM, I'M NOT HAPPY WITH

1002
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
ANY OF THIS, AND I KNOW HUNDREDS

1003
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
OF MOMS THAT AREN'T EITHER AND

1004
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
FAMILIES.

1005
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
>> John: EXACTLY.

1006
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
FOR SOME FAMILIES OF VICTIMS,

1007
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR

1008
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
VOICES HEARD IS PRICELESS, WHICH

1009
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
IS TO SAY, A FUCK OF A LOT MORE

1010
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
THAN $48,000.

1011
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
SOME HAVE EVEN CALLED IN TO

1012
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
COURT ONLY TO BE TOLD IT WASN'T

1013
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
THE RIGHT FORUM.

1014
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
ONE WOMAN CALLED IN TO THE

1015
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
BANKRUPTCY HEARING AND SAID, "I

1016
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
LOST MY BROTHER TRAGICALLY AT

1017
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
THE TIP OF THE EPIDEMIC IN 2012.

1018
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN MEMORY

1019
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
OF MY BROTHER."

1020
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
TO WHICH THE JUDGE REPLIED, "I

1021
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
HOLD HEARINGS ON WHAT IS

1022
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
SCHEDULED BEFORE ME.

1023
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS THE

1024
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
PROPER FORUM TO DO THIS."

1025
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:28,000
AND THE THING IS, HE'S RIGHT.

1026
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
BUT THIS ALSO MAY BE THE LAST

1027
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
FORUM THESE FAMILIES HAVE TO BE

1028
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
HEARD.

1029
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
LOOK, IT MIGHT BE TRUE THAT THIS

1030
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
IS THE BEST DEAL WE CAN GET

1031
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,000
UNDER OUR CURRENT SYSTEM.

1032
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
BUT THE FACT THAT'S THE CASE

1033
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
DOESN'T SPEAK TO WELL TO THIS

1034
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
DEAL, OR, INDEED, THE SYSTEM

1035
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,000
ITSELF.

1036
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "WELL,

1037
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
THE SACKLERS ARE PAYING SO MUCH

1038
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
ALREADY, WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?"

1039
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I'M NOT SURE THAT'S THE RIGHT

1040
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS.

1041
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
BECAUSE I'D ARGUE THAT WHEN YOUR

1042
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
FAMILY'S COMPANY RECKLESSLY SOLD

1043
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
A PRODUCT AS DAMAGING AS

1044
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
OXYCONTIN, THE QUESTION MIGHT

1045
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
NOT BE, "HOW MANY BILLIONS IS IT

1046
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
RIGHT FOR YOU TO PAY?"

1047
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
IT'S "HOW MANY BILLIONS IS IT

1048
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
RIGHT FOR YOU TO KEEP?"

1049
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
AND I WOULD ARGUE "NO BILLIONS."

1050
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
AND I'M AFRAID IT GETS ONE STEP

1051
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
WORSE, BECAUSE THE WAY THIS

1052
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
SETTLEMENT IS STRUCTURED, IT'S

1053
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
ACTUALLY HURTING THE SACKLERS

1054
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
EVEN LESS THAN YOU MIGHT THINK.

1055
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
THAT $4.3 BILLION THEY'VE AGREED

1056
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
TO PAY IS SPREAD OUT OVER NINE

1057
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
YEARS, WITH THE LARGEST PAYMENTS

1058
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
COMING TOWARD THE END OF THAT

1059
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
PERIOD, WHICH MEANS THEY COULD

1060
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
MAKE THAT MONEY UP IN INTEREST

1061
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
AND INVESTMENTS AND NEVER HAVE

1062
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
TO TOUCH THE PRINCIPAL.

1063
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
IN FACT, WHEN THE SACKLERS ARE

1064
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
DONE PAYING IN 2030, THEY WILL

1065
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
PROBABLY BE RICHER THAN THEY ARE

1066
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
TODAY.

1067
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
SO I GUESS THE ANSWER TO

1068
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
"WE'RE RICH?

1069
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
FOR HOW LONG?" IS "DON'T WORRY,

1070
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
FOREVER, DAVID, BECAUSE IT SEEMS

1071
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
THAT'S HOW THE FUCKING SYSTEM

1072
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
WORKS."

1073
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN IT COMES TO

1074
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE SACKLERS,

1075
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
THIS IS PROBABLY IT.

1076
00:28:46,000 --> 00:29:01,000
BECAUSE WHILE, TECHNICALLY, THE

1077
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:08,000
COULD STILL BE CRIMINALLY

1078
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
CHARGED, NOBODY EXPECTS

1079
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
THAT TO HAPPEN.

1080
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
AND IT'S JUST INFURIATING THAT

1081
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,000
THINGS ARE SET TO END SO

1082
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
COMFORTABLY FOR A FAMILY THAT'S

1083
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
MADE SO MUCH AT THE EXPENSE OF

1084
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,000
SO MANY.

1085
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,000
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, THERE IS

1086
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
ONE TINY POSITIVE HERE.

1087
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
AND THAT'S THAT PURDUE AND THE

1088
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
SACKLERS HAVE ALWAYS HEAVILY

1089
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
VALUED SECRECY.

1090
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
BUT THIS DEAL REQUIRES THE

1091
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,000
CREATION OF AN ONLINE PUBLIC

1092
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
REPOSITORY THAT WILL EVENTUALLY

1093
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
CONTAIN 30 MILLION DOCUMENTS

1094
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
INCLUDING DEPOSITION VIDEOS AND

1095
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,000
THE SACKLERS' COMPANY EMAILS.

1096
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
WHICH IS UNDENIABLY GOOD.

1097
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
BUT EVEN WITH THAT, LET'S ADMIT,

1098
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
WE'RE NOT GETTING ANYTHING

1099
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
APPROACHING JUSTICE HERE.

1100
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
AND THE SACKLERS, IN SPARING NO

1101
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
EXPENSE, HAVE SUCCESSFULLY

1102
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
BOUGHT THEIR WAY OUT OF THIS

1103
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
PROBLEM.

1104
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
WELL, NOT NO EXPENSE.

1105
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
BECAUSE AGAIN, DESPITE SPENDING

1106
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
MILLIONS ON LAWYERS, AND EVEN

1107
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
CREATING A WEBSITE FILLED WITH

1108
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
LEGAL PROPAGANDA, THEY STILL

1109
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
SOMEHOW COULDN'T SCRAPE UP THE

1110
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
$2,500 REQUIRED TO BUY THE

1111
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
DOT-COM FOR IT.

1112
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
AND THE REASON I HAPPEN TO KNOW

1113
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
EXACTLY HOW MUCH IT COSTS IS

1114
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MUCH WE SPENT

1115
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,000
TO BUY IT.

1116
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
IT'S TRUE: WE BOUGHT

1117
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
JudgeForYourselves.com,

1118
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
AND I KNOW THAT IT DOES

1119
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO EVEN THE

1120
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
SCALES HERE.

1121
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
BUT IT DOES GIVES ME THE TINIEST

1122
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
BIT OF COMFORT TO IMAGINE IT

1123
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
MIGHT IRRITATE THE SACKLERS JUST

1124
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
A BIT TO KNOW THAT WHEN PEOPLE

1125
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
GO TO THAT SITE IN THE FUTURE,

1126
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
THIS IS WHAT THEY'LL SEE.

1127
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000

YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE'LL THROW IN

00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,000
THIS NEW WEBSITE LETS

1161
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000

1162
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
WHETHER THE SACKLERS GOT OFF TOO

1163
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,000
EASY -- WHICH THEY DID.

1164
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,000
ON IT, YOU CAN SEE RICHARD

1165

00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
OF OUR EPISODES ABOUT THE

1167
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
OPIOIDS CRISIS, AND THERE'S EVEN

1168
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,000
A LINK THAT WILL EVENTUALLY

1169
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,000
DIRECT YOU TO THE DOCUMENT

1170
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000

1171
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
LAUNCHED.

1172
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
ALSO, BECAUSE THE FAMILIES OF

1173
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
THOSE IMPACTED BY THE SACKLERS

1174
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN HEARD, THERE

1175
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
ARE SOME EXCERPTS ON THE WEBSITE

1176
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
OF WHAT SOME OF THEM WANTED TO

1177
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
SAY.

1178
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
ALL OF THIS WILL BE UP AS LONG

AS WE OWN THE DOMAIN.

1180
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
AND THIS IS AT LEAST SOMETHING

1181
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
THE SACKLERS CAN'T THROW THEIR

1182
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
DIRTY MONEY AT AND MAKE GO AWAY.

1183
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT IT

1184
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
ISN'T FOR SALE AT ALL,

1185
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000

IT'S AVAILABLE FOR A PRICE.

1187
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
LET'S SAY $10 BILLION.

00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
THAT'S OUR SHOW.
