1
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:34,900
WELCOME, WELCOME,

2
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:35,833
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

3
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,523
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

4
00:00:37,557 --> 00:00:39,445
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
US.

5
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,898
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF
THE WEEK, WHICH HAS BEEN BUSY.

6
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,233
THE CDC EXPANDED ELIGIBILITY FOR

7
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,566
BOOSTER SHOTS, THE HOUSE VOTED

8
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:47,566
TO HOLD STEVE BANNON IN CONTEMPT

9
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:48,500
OF CONGRESS, AND ADELE WORE THE

10
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:49,866
SHIT OUT OF THIS HEAD TO TOE

11
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:52,633
CHOCOLATE LEATHER OUTFIT.

12
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,231
NO ONE'S WORN CHOCOLATE THAT

13
00:00:54,256 --> 00:00:55,950
WELL SINCE AUGUSTUS GLOOP.

14
00:00:55,975 --> 00:00:58,746
THAT'S A FASHION FACT. BUT
WE'RE GOING TO START WITH THIS.

15
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,175
 IN POLICE DEPARTMENTS

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,533
NATIONWIDE, A CRUSH OF VACCINE

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,633
MANDATES ARE A FLASH POINT FOR

18
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,433
OFFICERS FACED WITH ROLLING UP
THEIR SLEEVES OR LOSING THEIR

19
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,000
JOBS.

20
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:10,733
 IN LEESBURG, VIRGINIA, SOME

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,000
OFFICERS SAY THEY MAY QUIT IF

22
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:12,800
THE VACCINE MANDATE MOVES

23
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:14,733
FORWARD.

24
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,200
 IN MASSACHUSETTS, THE STATE

25
00:01:16,266 --> 00:01:17,633
POLICE UNION BELIEVES AT LEAST

26
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,266
150 STATE POLICE OFFICERS WILL

27
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,700
RESIGN.

28
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:22,100
 ONE TROOPER WHO DECIDED TO

29
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:22,733
QUIT HAD SOME CHOICE WORDS FOR

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,500
THE GOVERNOR ON THE WAY OUT.

31
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:26,066
 THIS IS THE LAST TIME YOU'LL

32
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:27,833
HEAR ME IN A STATE PATROL CAR.

33
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,600
AND JAY INSLEE CAN KISS MY ASS.

34
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,566
WOW, A WALKIE DROP!

35
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:35,333
YOU DON'T SEE MANY OF THOSE!

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,500
AND THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE IT

37
00:01:36,566 --> 00:01:38,433
LOOKS PATHETIC.

38
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,066
DROPPING A MICROPHONE IS

39
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,300
INHERENTLY EXCITING.

40
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:42,933
YOU GET THE THUD AS IT HITS THE

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,733
FLOOR, AND THE CHEER OF THE

42
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,633
CROWD, BUT A WALKIE DROP?

43
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,800
THAT'S JUST A SAD MAN SITTING IN

44
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:49,566
A DARK CAR, DROPPING A HEAVY

45
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:51,766
OBJECT DIRECTLY ONTO HIS PENIS.

46
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:54,100
BUT IT'S TRUE.

47
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,533
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, A SMALL

48
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,866
MINORITY OF POLICE OFFICERS HAVE

49
00:01:56,933 --> 00:01:58,400
RECEIVED DISPROPORTIONATE

50
00:01:58,466 --> 00:01:59,866
COVERAGE AFTER THREATENING TO

51
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:01,700
RESIGN OVER COVID MANDATES.

52
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:02,766
THEY'VE FRAMED THIS AS A MATTER

53
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,333
OF INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY, EVEN IN

54
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,866
CASES WHERE VERY LITTLE WAS

55
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:07,666
BEING ASKED OF THEM.

56
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:09,166
IN CHICAGO, OFFICERS WERE MERELY

57
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:10,533
ASKED TO REGISTER THEIR

58
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,266
VACCINATION STATUS ON A PORTAL,

59
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,900
AND FOR NOW CAN STILL WORK IF

60
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:15,000
THEY'RE UNVACCINATED, SO LONG AS

61
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:17,400
THEY'RE REGULARLY TESTED.

62
00:02:17,466 --> 00:02:18,966
BUT NEVERTHELESS, JOHN

63
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:20,366
CATANZARA, THE HEAD OF CHICAGO'S

64
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:22,100
FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE, TOLD

65
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,933
HIS OFFICERS FLAT OUT, "DO NOT

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,433
COMPLY WITH ANY DIRECT ORDER TO

67
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,700
FILL OUT THE PORTAL, PERIOD."

68
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:30,366
HE'S ACTUALLY BEEN ESPECIALLY

69
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:31,033
VOCAL IN HIS OPPOSITION TO

70
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,600
VACCINE MANDATES FOR OFFICERS,

71
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,390
INCLUDING AN OFFENSIVE STATEMENT

72
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:36,978
THAT I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT,
I'M JUST GOING TO SHOW YOU HIS

73
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:39,300
APOLOGY FOR IT, BECAUSE I DO
THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO WORK IT

74
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:40,666
OUT FROM CONTEXT.

75
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:42,700
 IN NO WAY WAS I TRYING TO TIE

76
00:02:42,766 --> 00:02:44,133
FORCED VACCINATIONS TO THE

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,800
ATROCITIES OF THE HOLOCAUST,

78
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:50,466
WHICH IS WHY I NEVER USED THE
WORD HOLOCAUST.

79
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:51,900
I SHOULD NOT HAVE MADE THE

80
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:52,833
REFERENCE LIKE I DID TO THE

81
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,341
SHOWERS AND FOR THAT I AM SORRY.

82
00:02:55,366 --> 00:02:58,300
WOW, JUST A BIG YIKES
TO EVERYTHING GOING ON THERE.

83
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:00,866
SETTING ASIDE THE PRONUNCIATION

84
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:02,066
OF "HOLE-OCAUST" -- AND BELIEVE

85
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:03,733
ME, I HAVE NOTHING BUT QUESTIONS

86
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,200
ABOUT THAT -- ARGUING THAT,

87
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:06,300
"TECHNICALLY I NEVER SAID THE

88
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:08,466
WORD HOLOCAUST, I JUST

89
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:10,789
REFERENCED THE SHOWERS" IS
TOTALLY ABSURD.

90
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:13,281
AND FINALLY -- AND THIS IS
PROBABLY THE LEAST IMPORTANT

91
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,733
THING TO SAY HERE -- AT LEAST

92
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,466
CENTER YOURSELF IN THE FUCKING

93
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:16,820
FRAME!

94
00:03:16,845 --> 00:03:19,366
IT'S JUST NOT THAT HARD!
A QUICK SCOOTCH OF THE LAPTOP

95
00:03:19,441 --> 00:03:20,874
AND YOU'RE THERE.

96
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:21,900
AND LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO BE IN

97
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:23,300
THE BUSINESS OF ART DIRECTING

98
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:25,666
"HOLE-OCAUST" NON-APOLOGIES, BUT

99
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:27,767
FRANKLY, YOU'VE LEFT ME NO
CHOICE.

100
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:31,733
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW, EVEN BY THE
SUBTERRANEAN STANDARDS OF THE

101
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,866
CHICAGO PD, THIS GUY IS A LOT.

102
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:36,366
HE HAS BEEN SUSPENDED EIGHT

103
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:37,800
TIMES AND HAS RECEIVED MORE

104
00:03:37,866 --> 00:03:38,466
MISCONDUCT COMPLAINTS PER YEAR

105
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:41,333
OF SERVICE THAN 96% OF HIS

106
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,766
FELLOW CHICAGO OFFICERS.

107
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,566
AND YET, THIS IS WHO HIS UNION

108
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:46,766
MEMBERS CHOSE TO REPRESENT THEM.

109
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,166
SO NEXT TIME SOMEONE SAYS TO

110
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:50,300
YOU, "NOT ALL COPS ARE BAD," YOU

111
00:03:50,366 --> 00:03:51,966
CAN RESPOND, "NO, JUST THEIR

112
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:54,400
FAVORITE ONES!"

113
00:03:54,466 --> 00:03:55,966
AND CATANZARA'S HOSTILITY TO A

114
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:57,600
VACCINE MANDATE IS PARTICULARLY

115
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:58,366
NOTEWORTHY GIVEN ONE OF HIS

116
00:03:58,433 --> 00:03:59,566
PREDECESSORS AS HEAD OF THE

117
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:01,166
UNION DIED OF COVID JUST THIS

118
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:03,633
MONTH.

119
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,000
WHICH ACTUALLY BRINGS US TO A

120
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:06,566
STAGGERING FACT.

121
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:07,566
 SINCE THE START OF THE

122
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:09,233
PANDEMIC, MORE THAN FOUR TIMES

123
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,166
AS MANY OFFICERS HAVE DIED FROM

124
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:13,000
COVID-19 AS FROM GUNFIRE.

125
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:13,966
THIS DESPITE BEING AMONG THE

126
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:16,159
FIRST GROUPS TO HAVE ACCESS TO
SHOW

127
00:04:16,184 --> 00:04:20,029
THE VACCINE. YEAH. FOUR
TIMES MORE POLICE OFFICERS

128
00:04:20,054 --> 00:04:21,966
HAVE DIED FROM COVID THAN
GUNFIRE.

129
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:24,224
THAT'S A TERRIBLE STATISTIC,

130
00:04:24,249 --> 00:04:26,904
WHICH YOU MIGHT NOT FULLY
ABSORB, GIVEN THAT CNN'S

131
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:30,666
GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT REPRESENTED
IT WITH ONE BAR THAT'S ONLY

132
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:32,800
ABOUT TWICE AS BIG AS THE OTHER.

133
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:33,666
SO WELCOME TO CNN.

134
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:34,866
IF YOU WANT TO INSTANTLY

135
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:36,066
UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENT WAYS

136
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:36,866
POLICE DIE, IT'S GOING TO BE

137
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:38,233
TRICKY.

138
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,866
BUT IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND

139
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:41,133
THE ONE WAY A CERTAIN BRITISH

140
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,166
ROYAL DIED, IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY!

141
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:43,700
9:00 P.M. EASTERN, SUNDAY

142
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:45,000
NIGHTS.

143
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:46,133
THOUGH NO NEED TO WATCH.

144
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,866
SPOILER ALERT, IT WAS THE

145
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:49,900
MOTHER-IN-LAW.

146
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:51,533
THERE'S ALSO THE KEY MATTER OF

147
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,633
THE FACT THAT THE POLICE ARE

148
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,166
SUPPOSED TO BE KEEPING THE

149
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:54,566
PUBLIC SAFE.

150
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:56,866
THAT'S THE POINT OF THEIR JOBS.

151
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:59,400
YET SOME DON'T SEEM TO GIVE MUCH

152
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,633
OF A SHIT ABOUT THAT.

153
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,800
TAKE THIS VIDEO OF NYPD OFFICERS

154
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:04,166
FLIPPING OUT OVER A SUBWAY RIDER

155
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:05,333
WHO SIMPLY ASKED THEM TO PUT ON

156
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,300
A MASK.

157
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:08,666
 CELL PHONE VIDEO TAKEN

158
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:09,966
TUESDAY MORNING SHOWS AN

159
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:12,500
UNMASKED NYPD OFFICER PUSHING A

160
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:14,933
MASKED COMMUTER OUT OF THE 8TH

161
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,700
STREET SUBWAY STATION AND

162
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:18,933
CLOSING THE EMERGENCY EXIT DOOR.

163
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,166
AS THE COP WALKS AWAY, HE SAYS.

164
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:23,233
 YOU'RE BEING DISRUPTIVE.

165
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,600
OKAY, FIRST, YOU OPENED

166
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,566
THE EMERGENCY DOOR?

167
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:28,000
OH, NO!

168
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:29,900
EVERYONE IN NEW YORK KNOWS YOU

169
00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:32,933
CAN'T OPEN THE EMERGENCY DOOR!

170
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,500
NOT UNLESS IT'S AN EMERGENCY!

171
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:37,500
ALSO, DISRUPTIVE?

172
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:38,266
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ON THE

173
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,933
SUBWAY?

174
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,033
YOU KNOW, THE BIG METAL WORM

175
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,233
THAT SCREAMS?

176
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,500
THE PLACE WHERE EVERY DAY, YOU

177
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:45,800
SEE THE BIGGEST RAT TO EVER WALK

178
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:46,900
THE EARTH AND THEN YOU JUST GO

179
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:50,766
TO WORK LIKE IT'S NOTHING?

180
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,100
YOU'RE IN DISRUPTION JUNCTION,

181
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,066
BABY.

182
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:54,033
IT'S ALSO WORTH REMEMBERING THAT

183
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:54,866
NEW YORK STILL HAS A MASK

184
00:05:54,933 --> 00:05:56,133
MANDATE ON PUBLIC TRANSIT, AND

185
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,000
ANYONE CAUGHT WITHOUT ONE RISKS

186
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,433
A $50 FINE -- EXCEPT,

187
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,933
APPARENTLY, THE COPS.

188
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,633
AND THIS ALL SUMS UP THE

189
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,200
AMERICAN POLICE PROBLEM IN

190
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:05,500
MINIATURE.

191
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:06,700
THE CONSTANT REFRAIN WE HEAR

192
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,933
FROM COPS EVERY TIME THEY KILL

193
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,433
AN UNARMED BLACK PERSON IS "THEY

194
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,400
SHOULD HAVE COMPLIED WITH

195
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:12,233
COMMANDS," BECAUSE AS LONG AS

196
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,133
YOU COMPLY, THINGS WILL

197
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,833
SUPPOSEDLY GO WELL.

198
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,700
BUT THAT ONLY SEEMS TO WORK ONE

199
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:19,000
WAY.

200
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:20,100
BECAUSE WHEN OFFICERS ARE ASKED

201
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:20,700
TO FOLLOW SIMPLE RULES OR FACE

202
00:06:20,766 --> 00:06:21,933
CONSEQUENCES, A NOT

203
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,500
INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THEM

204
00:06:24,566 --> 00:06:25,333
FLIP THEIR SHIT.

205
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,966
SO YOU KNOW WHAT?

206
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:28,500
IF AN OFFICER WANTS TO QUIT OVER

207
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:30,642
THIS, FUCKING LET THEM.

208
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:32,790
LET THE INDIVIDUALS WHO CLEARLY

209
00:06:32,823 --> 00:06:37,845
DON'T CARE ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY
STOP BEING IN CHARGE OF PUBLIC SAFETY.

210
00:06:37,973 --> 00:06:40,398
IT IS REALLY THAT SIMPLE.

211
00:06:40,423 --> 00:06:41,823
AND, BY THE WAY, THAT IS A

212
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:47,624
MOTHERFUCKING WALKIE
DROP. OW. AND NOW THIS.

213
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:49,733
 AND NOW, THE WEATHER

214
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,900
CHANNEL'S GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT IS

215
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:53,819
STILL NOT FUCKING AROUND.

216
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:55,933
 LET'S TAKE THIS CAR INTO

217
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,800
AUGMENTED REALITY AND TALK ABOUT

218
00:06:57,866 --> 00:06:59,033
HOW THE WEATHER IMPACTS YOUR
TRAVEL.

219
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,166
 YOU TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF LIKE

220
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:02,633
THAT TO GET TO YOUR SPOT.

221
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,933
 BEING CLOSE TO A RAGING

222
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,140
WILDFIRE LIKE THIS ONE IS A

223
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,833
TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE.

224
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,400
 YOU CAN SEE LARGE OBJECTS, A

225
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:12,966
TRUCK RIGHT HERE.

226
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,733
THOSE SNOWMOBILES CAN REALLY
PICK UP SPEED.

227
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:18,621
 WAS AS A TRULY

228
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:20,966
LIFE-THREATENING.
THIS IS AN SUV.

229
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:23,800
 YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING, A

230
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:24,700
BUS?

231
00:07:24,766 --> 00:07:26,300
I HOPE THIS BUS STOPS.

232
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:28,166
 YOU MIGHT GET CAUGHT

233
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:32,433
OFF GUARD.

234
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,600
TREES AND STARTED TO COME
DOWN.

235
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:35,600
 WHAT'S THAT?

236
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:41,400
THAT'S THE MAGIC TOP HAT.

237
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:42,433
THE SCENE WITH THE FOG IS

238
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,100
GETTING PRETTY SPOOKY.

239
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,500
WATCH OUT, HE IS COMING FOR YOU.

240
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:49,821
WHERE IS MY BROOM?

241
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:52,142
THIS WHICH IS OUT OF HERE.

242
00:07:58,904 --> 00:08:00,861
MOVING ON. OUR MAIN STORY
TONIGHT CONCERNS TAIWAN.

243
00:08:00,886 --> 00:08:03,300
IT'S HONESTLY REMARKABLE THAT WE
HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT TAIWAN

244
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:05,838
BEFORE ON THIS SHOW GIVEN IT'S
THE BIRTHPLACE OF BUBBLE TEA,

245
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:11,078
WHICH IS DELICIOUS, EVEN THOUGH
TAPIOCA BALLS SOUNDS LIKE A SEX

246
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,833
MOVE FOR PEOPLE OVER 70, AND

247
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,000
ESPECIALLY SINCE TAIWAN SHARES

248
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:16,866
OUR UNHEALTHY OBSESSION WITH

249
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:17,533
MASCOTS, CITIES THERE MAKE TONS

250
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,833
OF THEM.

251
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,766
THERE'S THIS ONE, THE MILKFISH

252
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,500
KID, CELEBRATING ONE AREA'S

253
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:23,700
MILKFISH PRODUCTION.

254
00:08:23,766 --> 00:08:24,566
AND THERE'S THIS ONE, FROM A

255
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:25,300
REGION THAT PRODUCES BANANAS,

256
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:26,166
WHICH I DO NOT WANT TO TALK

257
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:28,100
ABOUT.

258
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,466
IN FACT, TAIWAN MAKES SO MANY

259
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,533
MASCOTS THAT IN SOME CITIES, THE

260
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
VERY ACT OF STORING THEM HAS

261
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,433
BECOME A PROBLEM.

262
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,933
 WE WENT WITH THE CITY

263
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,566
COUNCILOR TO A TAIPEI PUBLIC

264
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:38,866
SCHOOL FOLLOWING HER INTO THE

265
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:39,533
DEPTHS OF A BASEMENT PARKING

266
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,300
LOT.

267
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:42,633
HERE BEHIND A DOOR, WE

268
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,433
DISCOVERED A MOUNTAIN OF

269
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,133
ABANDONED MASCOTS.

270
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,466
THIS IS SACRED FIRE BABY FROM

271
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:51,733
2013 NATIONAL GAMES HELD IN

272
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,733
TAIPEI.

273
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,100
 THE CITY GOVERNMENT SHOULD

274
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,433
REALLY THINK ABOUT WHETHER IT'S

275
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:58,966
NECESSARY TO KEEP CREATING

276
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:01,233
ONE-OFF MASCOTS.

277
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,633
OH, COME ON.

278
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,100
YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP MAKING

279
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,766
MASCOTS AND THROWING THEM AWAY.

280
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:07,966
THANKFULLY, AT THE END OF EACH

281
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:10,700
OF OUR SEASONS, OUR MASCOTS GO

282
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:11,266
TO LIVE ON A BEAUTIFUL FARM.

283
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,133
A FANTASTIC GREEN FARM, WHERE

284
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,700
JEFF THE DISEASED LUNG CAN

285
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:15,833
BREATHE FRESH AIR, AND THE POLAR

286
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,166
BEAR WITH A BROKEN PENIS CAN GET

287
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:19,600
THE CARE HE SO BADLY NEEDS.

288
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:20,366
I KEEP ASKING MY PRODUCER WHERE

289
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:22,033
THIS FARM IS, AND SHE KEEPS

290
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,700
SAYING, "I'LL TELL YOU WHEN

291
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:23,600
YOU'RE OLDER."

292
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,800
I CAN'T WAIT!

293
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,100
BUT OBVIOUSLY, THE MAJOR REASON

294
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,600
TAIWAN ENDS UP IN THE NEWS THESE

295
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,066
DAYS IS BECAUSE OF ITS

296
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:31,933
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA, WHICH,

297
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,300
TO PUT IT MILDLY, IS FRAUGHT.

298
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:38,866
AND RECENTLY, GETTING EVEN

299
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:39,166
FRAUGHTER.

300
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:40,033
 CHINA HAS LONG VIEWED TAIWAN

301
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,700
AS ITS OWN NATIONAL TERRITORY.

302
00:09:41,766 --> 00:09:42,733
CHINA'S PRESIDENT, XI JINPING,

303
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,333
ON SATURDAY ALL BUT DECLARING IT

304
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,233
POLICY.

305
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,866
"THE COMPLETE REUNIFICATION OF

306
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:49,866
OUR COUNTRY MUST BE AND WILL BE

307
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:51,233
REALIZED," HE SAID.

308
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,900
 MILITARY TENSIONS BETWEEN THE

309
00:09:52,966 --> 00:09:54,166
TWO SIDES ARE SOARING.

310
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:57,400
CHINA'S AIR FORCE SENT NEARLY

311
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:58,300
150 PLANES INTO TAIWAN'S AIR

312
00:09:58,366 --> 00:09:59,000
DEFENSE ZONE SINCE THE START OF

313
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,333
THIS MONTH.

314
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,700
YEAH.

315
00:10:04,766 --> 00:10:05,300
THEY DID.

316
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:05,900
NOT EXACTLY LIKE THAT, THOUGH,

317
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:06,700
IN A BIG STACK.

318
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:07,466
I'M PRESUMING THEY FLEW THE

319
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:08,500
PLANES OUT ONE AT A TIME, NOT

320
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,933
HEAPED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER LIKE

321
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,900
AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER'S

322
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:13,800
NIGHTMARE.

323
00:10:13,866 --> 00:10:15,200
THE POINT IS, CHINA INSISTS THAT

324
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:16,300
TAIWAN, AN INDEPENDENTLY

325
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,366
OPERATING ENTITY WITH ITS OWN

326
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:18,933
DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED LEADERS,

327
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,966
ARMED FORCES, AND CONSTITUTION,

328
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:22,933
IS ACTUALLY PART OF CHINA, AND

329
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,033
IN NO WAY A SEPARATE COUNTRY.

330
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,500
HERE'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

331
00:10:27,566 --> 00:10:28,066
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT FEELS

332
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:30,600
STRONGLY ABOUT THIS.

333
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,300
SO STRONGLY, IN FACT, THAT WHEN

334
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:33,166
JOHN CENA WENT ON A PRESS TOUR

335
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,533
FOR THE MOST RECENT "FAST &

336
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,833
FURIOUS" MOVIE AND SAID TAIWAN

337
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,700
IS THE FIRST "COUNTRY" THAT CAN

338
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:38,600
WATCH "F9," THIS IS WHAT

339
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,366
HAPPENED NEXT.

340
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:42,400
 ACTOR JOHN CENA HAS

341
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:43,900
APOLOGIZED TO CHINA AFTER HE

342
00:10:43,966 --> 00:10:54,000
CALLED TAIWAN A COUNTRY.

343
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:07,466
EVERY PART OF THAT IS

344
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,400
SO WEIRD.

345
00:11:08,466 --> 00:11:09,200
IT'S WEIRD JOHN CENA APOLOGIZED

346
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:10,166
TO CHINA.

347
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:11,466
IT'S WEIRD HE DID IT FOR CALLING

348
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:12,533
TAIWAN A "COUNTRY."

349
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,533
AND IT'S WEIRD TO SEE HIM DO IT

350
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,066
IN PRETTY DECENT MANDARIN.

351
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,100
THAT'S JUST TOO MANY WEIRD

352
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:18,333
THINGS!

353
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,866
I HALF EXPECT THAT SHOT TO PAN

354
00:11:19,933 --> 00:11:20,866
OUT TO REVEAL HE'S ALSO DOING A

355
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:22,033
NEEDLEPOINT OF LIAM NEESON

356
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,166
KISSING AN OSTRICH.

357
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:24,666
HONESTLY, IT WOULD ONLY MAKE IT

358
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:26,633
SLIGHTLY STRANGER.

359
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,400
BUT JOHN CENA ISN'T ALONE.

360
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:31,500
TAIWAN IS SUCH A THIRD RAIL FOR

361
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:32,733
CHINA THAT IT MAY BE WHY

362
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,933
PARAMOUNT PICTURES REMOVED THE

363
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,033
TAIWANESE FLAG FROM TOM CRUISE'S

364
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,266
JACKET FOR THE "TOP GUN" SEQUEL,

365
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,266
AND IT'S DEFINITELY WHY THE GAP

366
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,300
APOLOGIZED FOR RELEASING THIS

367
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,633
T-SHIRT FEATURING A MAP OF CHINA

368
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,000
WITHOUT TAIWAN ATTACHED.

369
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:46,900
THAT SHIRT CAUSED A SHITSTORM,

370
00:11:46,966 --> 00:11:48,433
AND IT LED TO THE GAP, MAKERS OF

371
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,033
THE T-SHIRT DADS WEAR WHILE

372
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,533
THEY'RE ON THE ELLIPTICAL FOR

373
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,133
30 MINUTES, APOLOGIZING TO 1.4

374
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,500
BILLION PEOPLE.

375
00:11:58,566 --> 00:12:02,600
SO IF CHINA IS GETTING T-SHIRT

376
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:03,266
RETRACTIONS FROM THE GAP, LOUDLY

377
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,133
VOWING TO REUNIFY WITH TAIWAN

378
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,400
AND SENDING STACKS OF WAR PLANES

379
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:06,400
TOWARDS IT IN RECORD-BREAKING

380
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:07,566
NUMBERS, IT FEELS LIKE TONIGHT,

381
00:12:07,633 --> 00:12:09,133
IT'D BE WORTH TAKING A LOOK AT

382
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,566
TAIWAN, HOW IT GOT TO BE IN THE

383
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:12,766
UNIQUE POSITION IT'S IN, WHAT

384
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:13,900
THE WORLD WANTS FROM IT, AND

385
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:14,933
MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHAT IT WANTS

386
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,866
FOR ITSELF.

387
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:17,900
AND LET'S START WITH HOW WE GOT

388
00:12:17,966 --> 00:12:20,800
HERE.

389
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:21,433
HISTORICALLY, TAIWAN HAS BEEN

390
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,833
LIKE THE STANLEY CUP OF ASIAN

391
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,666
HISTORY, IN THAT DIFFERENT

392
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:26,266
PEOPLE KEEP PASSING IT AROUND

393
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,133
AND CARVING THEIR NAMES ON IT.

394
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
HERE'S A LUDICROUSLY BRIEF

395
00:12:29,266 --> 00:12:30,000
HISTORY OF THE LAST 400 YEARS

396
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:31,966
THERE.

397
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:32,733
TAIWAN, OR AS IT'S SOMETIMES

398
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,166
BEEN CALLED, "FORMOSA," WAS

399
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:35,700
FIRST HOME TO INDIGENOUS PEOPLE,

400
00:12:35,766 --> 00:12:36,766
THEN COLONIZED BY THE DUTCH, AND

401
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,533
BRIEFLY THE SPANISH, BEFORE

402
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,300
CHINA'S QING DYNASTY HELD IT FOR

403
00:12:40,366 --> 00:12:42,466
ABOUT 200 YEARS.

404
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:44,166
THEN, IN 1895, CHINA LOST TAIWAN

405
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:46,233
TO JAPAN, WHICH TURNED IT INTO A

406
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,333
SO-CALLED "MODEL COLONY,"

407
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
IMPOSING JAPANESE CULTURAL

408
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:50,666
VALUES, AND GENERALLY RULING IT

409
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:52,000
WITH AN IRON FIST.

410
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:54,066
THEN, AFTER WORLD WAR II, TWO

411
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:56,666
MAJOR THINGS HAPPENED.

412
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:57,633
FIRST, THE ALLIES PUT TAIWAN

413
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,100
BACK UNDER CHINESE CONTROL.

414
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,566
AND SECOND, THE CIVIL WAR THAT

415
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:02,200
WAS TAKING PLACE IN CHINA

416
00:13:02,266 --> 00:13:02,866
BETWEEN THE NATIONALIST

417
00:13:02,933 --> 00:13:04,066
GOVERNMENT LED BY CHIANG

418
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:05,766
KAI-SHEK AND THE COMMUNISTS, LED

419
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,633
BY MAO ZEDONG, ENDED.

420
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,700
SPOILER ALERT, THE COMMUNISTS

421
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:10,800
WON.

422
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:12,566
CONGRATULATIONS TO MAO.

423
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:15,033
AND IN THE WAKE OF THAT DEFEAT,

424
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,233
CHIANG KAI-SHEK FLED TO TAIWAN,

425
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,600
ALONG WITH 2 MILLION NATIONALIST

426
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:19,766
SOLDIERS AND REFUGEES, BASICALLY

427
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,533
SETTING UP A CHINESE GOVERNMENT

428
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,566
IN EXILE.

429
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:24,600
MEANING CHINA TECHNICALLY HAD

430
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,066
TWO GOVERNMENTS AT THE TIME, ONE

431
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:28,833
IN CHINA, AND ONE IN TAIWAN.

432
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,333
AND WESTERN COUNTRIES WERE VERY

433
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,166
INVESTED IN THE SUCCESS OF THE

434
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:33,500
SECOND ONE, EVEN CALLING TAIWAN

435
00:13:33,566 --> 00:13:36,700
"FREE CHINA," BECAUSE THEY SAW

436
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:37,500
IT AS A NECESSARY BULWARK

437
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,100
AGAINST COMMUNISM.

438
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,233
 AGAINST ALL PROPHECIES,

439
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,266
FORMOSA STILL KEEPS THE

440
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,000
ANTI-COMMUNIST FLAG FLYING ONLY

441
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:44,633
100 MILES OR SO OFF THE MAINLAND

442
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,300
OF CHINA.

443
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:48,000
IT'S A PROSPEROUS ISLAND WHERE

444
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:48,633
THE NEW GENERATIONS GROW UP IN

445
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,133
FREEDOM.

446
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,400
A COMPLETE CONTRAST TO

447
00:13:51,466 --> 00:13:52,100
CONDITIONS UNDER THE RULE OF MAO

448
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,533
TSE-TUNG.

449
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,733
I DO MISS THAT PERIOD

450
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
OF HUMAN HISTORY WHERE THE ONLY

451
00:13:56,866 --> 00:13:57,666
WAY TO LEARN ABOUT OTHER

452
00:13:57,733 --> 00:13:59,366
CULTURES WAS TO HAVE A BRITISH

453
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:00,766
MAN ON AMPHETAMINES TELL YOU

454
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:01,733
WHICH WERE THE GOOD ONES AND

455
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,433
WHICH WERE THE BADDIES.

456
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,800
"HERE WE SEE FORMOSANS LIVING IN

457
00:14:04,866 --> 00:14:05,966
FREEDOM.

458
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:07,066
WELL, NOT FREEDOM PER SE, BUT

459
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:07,933
THE POINT IS, THEY'RE NOT

460
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,933
COMMIES, AND THAT'S WHERE MY

461
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,733
CURIOSITY TERMINATES."

462
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,166
BUT WHILE CHIANG KAI-SHEK MIGHT

463
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:15,433
HAVE BEEN A STAUNCHLY

464
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,700
ANTI-COMMUNIST U.S. ALLY,

465
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:18,300
HISTORICALLY, WE'VE HAD A LOT OF

466
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:19,700
THOSE, AND THEY OFTEN HAVEN'T

467
00:14:19,766 --> 00:14:22,033
BEEN GREAT PEOPLE.

468
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,400
AND CHIANG RULED TAIWAN AS A

469
00:14:23,466 --> 00:14:26,300
BRUTAL AUTHORITARIAN.

470
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,033
 THOUSANDS WERE SWEPT UP IN A

471
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,200
PERIOD THAT CAME TO BE KNOWN AS

472
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:30,266
"THE WHITE TERROR," SUFFERING

473
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:30,833
IMPRISONMENT, TORTURE, EVEN

474
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,666
EXECUTION.

475
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:34,833
DOING ANYTHING THAT COULD BE

476
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,400
REMOTELY CONSTRUED AS CRITICISM

477
00:14:36,466 --> 00:14:38,166
OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS EXTREMELY

478
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:39,533
RISKY, AS ONE WRITER DISCOVERED

479
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,133
WHEN HE MERELY TRANSLATED A

480
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:47,100
POPEYE COMIC STRIP.

481
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,666
 POPEYE AND HIS SON WERE IN

482
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:50,200
EXILE ON AN ISLAND AND THEY WERE

483
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:53,766
CAMPAIGNING FOR ELECTION THERE.

484
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,266
POPEYE GAVE A SPEECH AND USED AN

485
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,533
ENGLISH WORD, "FELLOWS."

486
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,000
THERE COULD BE HUNDREDS OF

487
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,600
TRANSLATIONS FOR "FELLOWS," BUT

488
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,066
I CHOSE ONE WHICH WAS, "ALL MY

489
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:06,400
FELLOW COUNTRYMEN."

490
00:15:06,466 --> 00:15:08,266
THIS WAS TERRIBLE.

491
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,633
THE BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

492
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,833
ARRESTED ME SAYING, "WHY DIDN'T

493
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,700
YOU TRANSLATE IT INTO SOMETHING

494
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:13,000
ELSE?

495
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:14,466
THIS IS EXACTLY THE WAY OUR

496
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:19,800
PRESIDENT CHIANG SPEAKS.

497
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:21,166
YOU ARE MAKING FUN OF HIM.

498
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:22,800
IT DESERVES THE DEATH PENALTY,

499
00:15:22,866 --> 00:15:28,133
NO DOUBT, THE DEATH PENALTY."

500
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,566
IT'S TRUE.

501
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:29,333
THAT GUY WAS INTERROGATED FOR

502
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:29,933
MONTHS ON SUSPICION OF BEING A

503
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,633
COMMUNIST COLLABORATOR, AND

504
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,600
ULTIMATELY SPENT NINE YEARS IN

505
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,300
PRISON, ALL BECAUSE CHIANG'S

506
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,833
GOVERNMENT THOUGHT A POPEYE

507
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,933
COMIC HAD A HIDDEN POLITICAL

508
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,500
MESSAGE.

509
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:39,300
WHICH IS A BIT OF A REACH.

510
00:15:39,366 --> 00:15:40,833
THERE IS CLEARLY NO DEEPER

511
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,800
MEANING TO POPEYE COMICS, OTHER

512
00:15:41,866 --> 00:15:43,200
THAN WOMEN ARE INHERENTLY PRIZES

513
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:45,300
TO BE FOUGHT OVER, PERFORMANCE

514
00:15:45,366 --> 00:15:47,133
ENHANCING DRUGS ARE COOL, AND

515
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,400
BLUTO DOESN'T DESERVE LOVE.

516
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:51,300
ALL OF WHICH IS TO SAY, IN THE

517
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:52,633
MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY,

518
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,400
TAIWAN WAS A GRIM PLACE.

519
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:58,100
BUT AFTER CHIANG DIED IN 1975,

520
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,166
UNDER PRESSURE BOTH

521
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:00,200
INTERNATIONALLY AND FROM

522
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:01,800
POLITICAL MOVEMENTS AT HOME, THE

523
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:03,533
NATIONALISTS BEGAN TO LOOSEN

524
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,533
THEIR GRIP, ENDING MARTIAL LAW

525
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,700
IN THE LATE '80s AND OPENING THE

526
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:07,533
DOOR TO FULL DEMOCRATIZATION.

527
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,000
SO AGAINST THE ODDS, TAIWAN

528
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:12,033
SHIFTED FROM A DICTATORSHIP TO A

529
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,433
FUNCTIONING, VIBRANT DEMOCRACY,

530
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,766
AND I DO MEAN VIBRANT.

531
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:17,933
 A DEBATE OVER HOW BILLIONS OF

532
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
EUROS WOULD BE ALLOCATED FOR AN

533
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:20,866
INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PLAN

534
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:21,866
DESCENDED INTO A BRAWL IN

535
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:25,066
TAIWAN'S PARLIAMENT ON TUESDAY.

536
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:26,733
MEMBERS OF THE RULING DEMOCRATIC

537
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,266
PROGRESSIVE PARTY AND THE

538
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,500
OPPOSITION NATIONALISTS PARTY

539
00:16:29,566 --> 00:16:30,433
THREW WATER AND SHOVED EACH

540
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,866
OTHER TO THE FLOOR.

541
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:34,166
TAIWAN'S MPS ARE KNOWN FOR

542
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:34,833
BRAWLING AND EVEN THROWING

543
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,866
OBJECTS AT EACH OTHER.

544
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:38,866
AND FIGHTS IN PARLIAMENT ARE

545
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:39,966
EVEN SEEN AS ONE WAY FOR THE

546
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,733
OPPOSITION TO SHOW VOTERS THAT

547
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,000
IT STANDS TOUGH ON ISSUES.

548
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:45,100
YEAH!

549
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,100
FIGHTING IS NOT UNCOMMON IN

550
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,366
TAIWAN'S PARLIAMENT.

551
00:16:49,433 --> 00:16:50,133
HERE THEY ARE THROWING WATER

552
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,000
BALLOONS AT EACH OTHER.

553
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:53,866
AND HERE THEY ARE HURLING PIG

554
00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:55,033
GUTS DURING A DEBATE ON PORK

555
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,033
IMPORTS.

556
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,166
AND THAT'S NOT ALL.

557
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:59,166
ONE TIME IN 2006, A MEMBER

558
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:00,300
SNATCHED A WRITTEN PROPOSAL OF A

559
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:01,066
BILL AND SHOVED IT INTO HER OWN

560
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:02,100
MOUTH.

561
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,500
WHICH IS FANTASTIC, AND

562
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:05,900
DEFINITELY SOMETHING WE SHOULD

563
00:17:05,966 --> 00:17:06,566
STEAL.

564
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:07,200
YOU WANT TO KILL A CLEAN ENERGY

565
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:08,066
BILL?

566
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:10,633
PULL UP A CHAIR AND FUCKING EAT

567
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,633
ALL 900 PAGES OF IT.

568
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,033
BUT TAIWAN ISN'T JUST A

569
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,000
FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACY.

570
00:17:17,066 --> 00:17:17,800
IT'S A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE

571
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:18,733
GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN.

572
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,133
TAIWAN WAS THE FASTEST GROWING

573
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,866
ECONOMY IN ASIA LAST YEAR, AND

574
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:21,900
IT'S THE WORLD'S KEY

575
00:17:21,966 --> 00:17:23,833
MANUFACTURER OF SEMICONDUCTORS,

576
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,466
WHICH ARE USED EVERYWHERE IN

577
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:28,833
PRODUCTS FROM CARS TO SEX TOYS.

578
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,433
SO THE NEXT TIME YOU FIRE UP A

579
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,866
BUTT PLUG THAT HAS 100,000 TIMES

580
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:33,133
MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN THE

581
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,800
"APOLLO" MOON MISSION, MAKE SURE

582
00:17:34,866 --> 00:17:38,033
YOU SAY, "THANKS, TAIWAN."

583
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,933
SO ALL OF THIS BRINGS US TO

584
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,466
WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW, WITH

585
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:42,933
TAIWAN ESTABLISHED AS A

586
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,500
HIGHLY-DEVELOPED AND WEALTHY

587
00:17:43,566 --> 00:17:44,733
COUNTRY.

588
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,700
AND YET, NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO

589
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,066
CALL IT ONE.

590
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,033
AND THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THE

591
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,766
HUGE, UNRESOLVED ISSUE OF

592
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,966
TAIWANESE SOVEREIGNTY.

593
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:54,900
BECAUSE CHINA NOW SEES CLAIMING

594
00:17:54,966 --> 00:17:55,933
TAIWAN AS A KEY POINT OF

595
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,866
NATIONAL PRIDE, WITH XI JINPING

596
00:17:57,933 --> 00:17:59,133
CALLING REUNIFICATION PART OF

597
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,300
HIS VISION FOR "THE GREAT

598
00:18:00,366 --> 00:18:03,466
REJUVENATION OF THE CHINESE

599
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:03,700
NATION."

600
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:04,433
AND ANYONE WANTING TO DO

601
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,033
BUSINESS IN CHINA KNOWS THAT

602
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,333
CALLING TAIWAN A COUNTRY IS A

603
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,266
MASSIVE FAUX PAS.

604
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,200
AND IT'S NOT JUST THE GAP AND

605
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:13,766
JOHN CENA WHO'VE FOUND THAT OUT.

606
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:14,966
ALL OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE

607
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:15,833
EITHER HAD TO APOLOGIZE FOR, OR

608
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,433
WALK BACK, EVEN THE SMALLEST

609
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,966
IMPLICATION THAT TAIWAN IS A

610
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:21,433
SEPARATE COUNTRY.

611
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,000
AND YOU CAN SEE THIS CAUTION

612
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:23,800
EVERYWHERE.

613
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:24,833
AT THIS YEAR'S OLYMPICS, YOU

614
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,666
PROBABLY SAW TAIWANESE ATHLETES

615
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:27,666
COMPETING NOT UNDER THE

616
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:29,133
TAIWANESE FLAG, BUT UNDER THE

617
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,666
FAKE PSEUDO-FLAG OF "CHINESE

618
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:31,800
TAIPEI," SOMETHING THEY'VE BEEN

619
00:18:31,866 --> 00:18:34,066
FORCED TO USE AT EVERY OLYMPICS

620
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:35,566
SINCE THE 1980s WHEN THEY

621
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:36,500
REACHED A COMPROMISE WITH THE

622
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:37,900
IOC THAT ALLOWED THEM TO

623
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:39,300
PARTICIPATE WITHOUT ANGERING

624
00:18:39,366 --> 00:18:40,633
CHINA.

625
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,766
BUT THIS ARRANGEMENT ISN'T

626
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:42,533
SOMETHING THAT ALL TAIWANESE

627
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,766
PEOPLE APPRECIATE.

628
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,500
IN FACT, DURING THE 2012 GAMES,

629
00:18:46,566 --> 00:18:47,233
THE LEAD SINGER OF TAIWANESE

630
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,500
HEAVY-METAL BAND CHTHONIC

631
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:52,666
POINTED OUT HOW LUDICROUS IT IS.

632
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:54,066
 OUR TEAM, OUR NATIONAL TEAM'S

633
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,200
BEEN CALLED CHINESE FUCKING

634
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:58,766
TAIPEI.

635
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,066
FUCKING BULLSHIT, RIGHT?

636
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:00,666
"OH, WE CAN'T CALL YOU TAIWAN,

637
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:01,933
SORRY.

638
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,666
WE HAVE TO CALL YOU CHINESE

639
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:06,733
FUCKING TAIPEI."

640
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,533
I KNOW I SAY THIS EVERY

641
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,233
WEEK, BUT THAT DEATH METAL

642
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,333
SINGER COMPLAINING ABOUT OLYMPIC

643
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,300
NOMENCLATURE HAS A POINT.

644
00:19:14,366 --> 00:19:15,900
ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR, IF THEIR

645
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:17,600
OFFICIAL OLYMPICS NAME REALLY

646
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,666
WAS "CHINESE FUCKING TAIPEI,"

647
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:20,800
THAT WOULD AT LEAST BE A LITTLE

648
00:19:20,866 --> 00:19:21,700
MORE ACCURATE VIS-A-VIS WHO'S

649
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:24,266
FUCKING WHOM.

650
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,866
AND EVEN HUGE INTERNATIONAL

651
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:27,133
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE W.H.O.

652
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,733
ARE FORCED TO PLAY THIS

653
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,866
RIDICULOUS GAME, FREEZING OUT

654
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:32,666
TAIWAN FROM FULL PARTICIPATION.

655
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:35,166
LAST YEAR, WHEN ONE W.H.O

656
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:36,100
OFFICIAL WAS PRESSED ON THIS

657
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,266
POINT BY A HONG KONG NEWSCASTER,

658
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,200
IT LED TO THIS VERY AWKWARD

659
00:19:39,266 --> 00:19:41,366
INTERACTION.

660
00:19:41,433 --> 00:19:43,366
 WILL W.H.O. CONSIDER TAIWAN'S

661
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,378
MEMBERSHIP?

662
00:19:53,722 --> 00:19:55,055
HELLO?

663
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,333
I'M SORRY. I CAN'T HEAR YOU. I COULDN'T
HEAR YOUR QUESTION. OKAY, YEAH.

664
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,266
LET ME -- LET ME REPEAT THE
QUESTION. NO, THAT'S OKAY.

665
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:04,300
LET'S MOVE TO ANOTHER ONE THEN.

666
00:20:04,366 --> 00:20:05,033
 I'M ACTUALLY CURIOUS ON

667
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,000
TALKING ABOUT TAIWAN AS WELL ON

668
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:08,415
TAIWAN'S CASE.

669
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:17,033
WE DECIDED TO GIVE DR. AYLWARD
ANOTHER CALL TO FOLLOW UP.

670
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,508
 AND I JUST WANT TO SEE IF YOU

671
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:21,133
CAN COMMENT A BIT ON HOW TAIWAN

672
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,300
HAS DONE SO FAR IN TERMS OF

673
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:25,466
CONTAINING THE VIRUS.

674
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:26,166
 WELL, WE'VE ALREADY TALKED

675
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:28,300
ABOUT CHINA.

676
00:20:28,366 --> 00:20:30,261
OH, WE DID, DID WE?

677
00:20:30,286 --> 00:20:34,269
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE FIRST, YOU

678
00:20:34,294 --> 00:20:36,691
PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR THE
QUESTION, THEN FAKED GETTING

679
00:20:36,716 --> 00:20:40,300
DISCONNECTED AFTER COMMITTING
THE WORLD'S MOST TELEGRAPHED LOGOFF.

680
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:42,700
THAT MAN COULDN'T BE MORE

681
00:20:42,766 --> 00:20:43,933
CLEARLY AVOIDING THE QUESTION IF

682
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,233
HE CAME BACK ONLINE PRETENDING

683
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,633
TO BE A LAMP.

684
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,101
"YOU CAN'T ASK A LAMP ABOUT
TAIWAN.

685
00:20:49,126 --> 00:20:51,140
ESPECIALLY ME -- I ONLY SPEAK
FRENCH.

686
00:20:51,165 --> 00:20:53,515
SO THAT'S TWO REASONS I SHOULDN'T
HAVE TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION.

687
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:55,933
I'M A LAMP, AND I ONLY SPEAK
FRENCH, EXCEPT FOR THIS BRIEF

688
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,400
PARAGRAPH IN ENGLISH EXPLAINING

689
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:58,833
MY SITUATION.

690
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,200
AU REVOIR!

691
00:21:00,266 --> 00:21:02,805
JE SUIS LAMP."

692
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,000
BUT IT'S NOT JUST COMPANIES AND

693
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:05,600
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.

694
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,033
THE VAST MAJORITY OF WORLD

695
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,333
GOVERNMENTS HAVE NO OFFICIAL

696
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,166
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN

697
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:12,033
BECAUSE CHINA WON'T HAVE

698
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,166
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH ANYONE

699
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:14,566
WHO DOES.

700
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:16,433
AND FOR ALL THE INITIAL

701
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,566
CHEERLEADING FROM WESTERN

702
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:18,200
COUNTRIES ABOUT "TAIWAN'S PLUCK

703
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:20,800
AND VERVE IN KEEPING THE

704
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:24,233
ANTI-COMMUNIST FLAG FLYING?"

705
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,566
THINGS HAVE SHIFTED.

706
00:21:25,633 --> 00:21:26,933
BY THE END OF THE 1970s, MOST

707
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,033
COUNTRIES HAD SWITCHED THEIR

708
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,600
RECOGNITION OF CHINA'S OFFICIAL

709
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:30,800
GOVERNMENT FROM THE ONE ON

710
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:32,000
TAIWAN, KNOWN AS THE REPUBLIC OF

711
00:21:32,066 --> 00:21:34,200
CHINA, TO THE COMMUNIST ONE ON

712
00:21:34,266 --> 00:21:36,100
THE MAINLAND, THE PEOPLE'S

713
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,166
REPUBLIC OF CHINA.

714
00:21:37,233 --> 00:21:38,833
IN FACT, TODAY, THE NUMBER OF

715
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,600
GOVERNMENTS STILL WILLING TO

716
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,600
DIPLOMATICALLY RECOGNIZE TAIWAN

717
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,333
HAS DWINDLED TO ONLY 14

718
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,166
COUNTRIES AND THE HOLY SEE.

719
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:47,100
ALTHOUGH THAT LAST ONE SHOULDN'T

720
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,533
BE SURPRISING.

721
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,933
YOU KNOW THE POPE.

722
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
HE LOVES TO STIR SHIT UP.

723
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:54,066
DRINKS WINE IN THE MORNING.

724
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:55,166
HE'S A MESSY BITCH WHO LIVES FOR

725
00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:57,533
DRAMA.

726
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,633
AS FOR AMERICA, WE'VE SPENT THE

727
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,000
PAST HALF CENTURY WALKING A

728
00:22:01,066 --> 00:22:02,233
DIPLOMATIC TIGHTROPE WITH A

729
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,966
POLICY KNOWN AS "STRATEGIC

730
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:05,266
AMBIGUITY."

731
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:08,033
IT'S SOMETHING THAT LETS US

732
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,000
MAINTAIN FUNCTIONAL RELATIONS

733
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:11,133
WITH TAIWAN AND STILL HAVE A

734
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,246
FULL FORMAL RELATIONSHIP WITH
CHINA.

735
00:22:13,271 --> 00:22:16,106
IT'S AN APPROACH THAT BEGAN IN
THE 1970s AND WAS BUILT UPON A

736
00:22:16,131 --> 00:22:19,600
SERIES OF INCREDIBLY CAREFULLY
WORDED STATEMENTS.

737
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:24,545
THE UNITED STATES IN ONE OF
OUR COMMUNIQUES WITH THE

738
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:31,531
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT TAIWAN IS A PART OF CHINA.

739
00:22:31,556 --> 00:22:35,773
BUT THE UNITED STATES ALSO DID
NOT ACCEPT THE PRC CLAIM TO TAIWAN.

740
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:38,445
THAT HAS BEEN OUR POSITION EVER
SINCE.

741
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:42,533
AND SO, IN EFFECT, THE U.S.
VIEWS TAIWAN'S STATUS AS

742
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,445
UNDETERMINED.

743
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,297
RIGHT.
WE ACKNOWLEDGED CHINA'S CLAIM,

744
00:22:48,322 --> 00:22:49,855
BUT DIDN'T AGREE WITH IT,

745
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,398
LEAVING TAIWAN'S STATUS AS
"UNDETERMINED."

746
00:22:52,423 --> 00:22:55,289
YOU KNOW, LIKE SHRODINGER'S CAT,
OR THE SCIENTOLOGY VERSION,

747
00:22:55,314 --> 00:22:58,666
MISCAVIGE'S WIFE.
THEY COULD BE ONE THING OR THE

748
00:22:58,733 --> 00:22:59,800
OTHER THING, AND NO ONE KNOWS

749
00:22:59,866 --> 00:23:00,766
FOR SURE, DO THEY, DAVID?

750
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:03,166
HEY DAVID, DAVID, WHERE'S

751
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:05,000
SHELLY?

752
00:23:05,066 --> 00:23:07,033
BUT THAT CONFUSION IS EMBLEMATIC

753
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,533
OF THE "STRATEGIC AMBIGUITY"

754
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,933
POLICY.

755
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
FOR INSTANCE, THE U.S. OPERATES

756
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:12,833
OUT OF THIS BUILDING IN TAIWAN,

757
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,466
OFTEN REFERRED TO AS ITS "DE

758
00:23:14,533 --> 00:23:15,600
FACTO EMBASSY," BUT NOT,

759
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,833
CRUCIALLY, AN ACTUAL EMBASSY.

760
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,233
MEANWHILE, TAIWAN HAS THIS

761
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,266
BUILDING IN D.C., WHICH DOES

762
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,900
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THAT AN

763
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:24,266
EMBASSY WOULD DO, JUST WITHOUT

764
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:26,166
ACTUALLY BEING CALLED ONE.

765
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:27,766
AND I KNOW THIS POLICY CAN

766
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,500
OCCASIONALLY SEEM RIDICULOUS,

767
00:23:29,566 --> 00:23:31,066
BUT THE UNCERTAINTY IS KIND OF

768
00:23:31,133 --> 00:23:32,833
THE POINT, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT

769
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,733
COMES TO DEFENSE.

770
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,500
IN 1979, CONGRESS PASSED THE

771
00:23:36,566 --> 00:23:38,266
TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT, IN WHICH

772
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,533
THE U.S. COMMITTED TO ASSIST

773
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,666
TAIWAN IN MAINTAINING ITS

774
00:23:40,733 --> 00:23:42,115
SELF-DEFENSE CAPABILITY.

775
00:23:42,266 --> 00:23:44,633
BUT THAT COMMITMENT VERY MUCH

776
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,966
STOPS SHORT OF THE U.S.

777
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:48,366
PROMISING TO DEFEND TAIWAN FROM
A CHINESE INVASION.

778
00:23:48,433 --> 00:23:49,806
INSTEAD, IT SAYS MILITARY

779
00:23:49,831 --> 00:23:55,251
AND THE EFFORT TO DETERMINE THE
FUTURE OF TAIWAN WOULD BE OF

780
00:23:55,276 --> 00:23:57,376
GRAVE CONCERN TO THE
UNITED STATES.

781
00:23:57,401 --> 00:23:59,845
AND WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

782
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,704
DOES IT MEAN THE U.S. WOULD
DEPLOY MILITARY ASSETS?

783
00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:05,197
OR JUST THAT A U.S. GENERAL
WOULD RAISE AN EYEBROW?

784
00:24:05,222 --> 00:24:09,236
NO ONE KNOWS.
IT'S A WILLFULLY CONFUSING

785
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:12,634
WILL-THEY OR WON'T-THEY DANCE,
THAT FOR 40 YEARS HAS BEEN THE

786
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,500
BACKBONE OF U.S.-TAIWAN POLICY.
AND LOOK, SO FAR, WE'VE BEEN

787
00:24:16,566 --> 00:24:17,400
TALKING ABOUT TAIWAN ALMOST

788
00:24:17,466 --> 00:24:18,266
EXCLUSIVELY IN TERMS OF WHAT

789
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,866
OTHER COUNTRIES WANT FROM IT.

790
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:21,400
BUT THE KEY QUESTION IS CLEARLY,

791
00:24:21,466 --> 00:24:23,633
WHAT DOES IT WANT FOR ITSELF?

792
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,933
BUT EVEN THAT'S NOT EASY TO

793
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,933
ANSWER.

794
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
TAIWAN IS MADE UP OF A MIX OF
DIFFERENT CULTURES, LANGUAGES

795
00:24:30,066 --> 00:24:32,033
AND POLITICAL VIEWPOINTS.
REMEMBER, THEIR LAWMAKERS

796
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,900
SOMETIMES THROW PIG INTESTINES

797
00:24:32,966 --> 00:24:34,833
AT EACH OTHER IN PARLIAMENT.

798
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,866
EVERYONE IS NOT ON THE SAME PAGE
THERE.

799
00:24:38,933 --> 00:24:41,300
BUT TO THE EXTENT TAIWANESE
PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN THROUGH THE

800
00:24:41,366 --> 00:24:42,833
BALLOT BOX, THEY'VE CHOSEN A

801
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,600
GOVERNMENT THAT WANTS TO KEEP

802
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:44,600
CHINA AT ARM'S LENGTH.

803
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:45,400
THAT SINGER YOU SAW EARLIER

804
00:24:45,466 --> 00:24:47,166
TALKING ABOUT "CHINESE FUCKING

805
00:24:47,233 --> 00:24:48,000
TAIPEI?"

806
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:50,000
HE'S ACTUALLY IN TAIWAN'S

807
00:24:50,066 --> 00:24:51,533
PARLIAMENT NOW, AND HE'S OPENLY

808
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,733
PRO-INDEPENDENCE.

809
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,900
AS FOR TAIWAN'S CURRENT LEADER,

810
00:24:54,966 --> 00:24:57,066
TSAI ING-WEN, SHE WAS ELECTED ON

811
00:24:57,133 --> 00:25:00,166
A PLATFORM OF DEFENDING TAIWAN,

812
00:25:00,233 --> 00:25:02,166
BUT, CRUCIALLY, PRESERVING THE

813
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:03,233
STATUS QUO.

814
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,833
JUST WATCH HOW CAUTIOUSLY SHE

815
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,933
DISCUSSES THE QUESTION OF

816
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,600
TAIWANESE INDEPENDENCE.

817
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:10,633
 ARE YOU IN PRINCIPLE AT LEAST

818
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,300
IN FAVOR OF THE IDEA OF FORMAL

819
00:25:13,366 --> 00:25:16,066
TAIWANESE INDEPENDENCE?

820
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:17,533
 THE REALITY, AND WHAT IT IS

821
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,166
NOW, IS THAT WE ARE ALREADY A

822
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:21,566
FUNCTIONALLY INDEPENDENT

823
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:23,866
COUNTRY.

824
00:25:23,933 --> 00:25:25,166
WE HAVE OUR OWN GOVERNMENT, AND

825
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:27,266
WE HAVE OUR OWN ELECTION.

826
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,733
 WILL THERE COME A DAY WHEN

827
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,066
THAT REALITY NEEDS TO BE SPELLED

828
00:25:30,133 --> 00:25:30,900
OUT BY A FORMAL DECLARATION OF

829
00:25:30,966 --> 00:25:32,966
INDEPENDENCE?

830
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,300
 THE IDEA IS THAT WE DON'T

831
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,033
HAVE A NEED TO DECLARE OURSELVES

832
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:36,966
AN INDEPENDENT STATE, BUT WE ARE

833
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:38,733
AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY.

834
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,533
RIGHT.

835
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,033
SHE'S CLEARLY DECLARING THAT

836
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,033
THEY'RE INDEPENDENT THERE, BUT

837
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,633
IS ALSO VERY MUCH DRAWING THE

838
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,700
LINE AT A DECLARATION OF

839
00:25:45,766 --> 00:25:47,266
INDEPENDENCE.

840
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:48,166
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT TAIWAN

841
00:25:48,233 --> 00:25:49,166
EXPLICITLY FORMALIZING THE WAY

842
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:50,666
THINGS ARE COULD CAUSE A LOT OF

843
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:52,566
TROUBLE.

844
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:53,966
IT'S LIKE MEETING YOUR PARTNER'S

845
00:25:54,033 --> 00:25:55,100
PARENTS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND

846
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:56,500
SAYING, "HELLO, I REGULARLY FUCK

847
00:25:56,566 --> 00:25:57,866
YOUR OFFSPRING."

848
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:58,866
YEAH.

849
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,800
EVERYONE WAS AWARE OF THAT.

850
00:26:00,866 --> 00:26:01,900
BUT NOW THAT YOU'VE OFFICIALLY

851
00:26:01,966 --> 00:26:03,466
DECLARED IT, THINGS ARE GOING TO

852
00:26:03,533 --> 00:26:05,300
GET MORE DIFFICULT FOR EVERYONE

853
00:26:05,366 --> 00:26:07,966
INVOLVED.

854
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,766
AND THE TRUTH IS, THAT INTENSE

855
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:11,133
PRAGMATISM IS IN LINE WITH HOW

856
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,133
MANY TAIWANESE PEOPLE FEEL.

857
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,533
POLLS HAVE CONSISTENTLY SHOWN

858
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,400
THAT WHEN THEY'RE ASKED ABOUT

859
00:26:16,466 --> 00:26:17,900
INDEPENDENCE FROM OR UNIFICATION

860
00:26:17,966 --> 00:26:20,633
WITH CHINA, SOMETHING LIKE 1.5

861
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,700
PERCENT WANT UNIFICATION WITH

862
00:26:21,766 --> 00:26:22,966
CHINA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND

863
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:24,633
ABOUT SIX PERCENT WANT

864
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,566
INDEPENDENCE AS SOON AS

865
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:29,633
POSSIBLE, BUT THE VAST MAJORITY

866
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,433
FAVOR SOME VERSION OF STICKING

867
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,300
WITH THE STATUS QUO, AT LEAST

868
00:26:31,366 --> 00:26:32,133
FOR NOW.

869
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,800
WHICH MAKES SENSE.

870
00:26:33,866 --> 00:26:35,400
BECAUSE AS THINGS STAND, AS

871
00:26:35,466 --> 00:26:37,633
VOLATILE AS THIS SITUATION CAN

872
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,653
APPEAR, DAY-TO-DAY LIFE IN
TAIWAN CAN GO ON AS NORMAL.

873
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:45,091
AS THIS TAIWANESE MAN SHOWS.

874
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:09,700
WOW.

875
00:27:09,766 --> 00:27:11,700
THAT IS A PRETTY RELAXED
ATTITUDE GIVEN THE

876
00:27:11,766 --> 00:27:13,566
CIRCUMSTANCES.

877
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:14,966
HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE

878
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,166
NUCLEAR-ARMED, SABER-RATTLING

879
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:16,800
SUPERPOWER TAUNTING HIS COUNTRY

880
00:27:16,866 --> 00:27:18,866
WITH WARPLANES LIKE IT'S SEASON

881
00:27:18,933 --> 00:27:21,466
TWO OF "EMILY IN PARIS."

882
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:23,000
"YOU KNOW, I DON'T LOVE THAT

883
00:27:23,066 --> 00:27:24,166
IT'S HAPPENING, BUT I JUST TRY

884
00:27:24,233 --> 00:27:26,689
TO CARRY ON WITH MY LIFE."

885
00:27:26,714 --> 00:27:31,633
BUT THE KEY QUESTION IS, CAN THE
CURRENTLY-SAFE STATUS QUO HOLD

886
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,366
FOREVER?

887
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:34,100
XI JINPING HAS STATED THAT THE

888
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:36,033
QUESTION OF TAIWAN CANNOT SIMPLY

889
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,400
BE "PASSED ON FROM GENERATION TO
GENERATION."

890
00:27:38,466 --> 00:27:39,633
AND THOSE MILITARY DRILLS SEEM

891
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,500
TO BE SENDING A MESSAGE.

892
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:43,266
AND WHILE EXPERTS SAY WAR ISN'T

893
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:45,500
IMMINENT, TAIWAN IS

894
00:27:45,566 --> 00:27:46,200
UNDERSTANDABLY THINKING ABOUT

895
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:47,700
ITS OWN DEFENSE CAPABILITIES.

896
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,966
SOMETHING, BY THE WAY, WE'VE

897
00:27:50,033 --> 00:27:51,400
BEEN HAPPY TO ASSIST THEM IN

898
00:27:51,466 --> 00:27:53,766
THINKING ABOUT, BY SELLING THEM

899
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:54,700
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN WEAPONS,

900
00:27:54,766 --> 00:27:57,366
SHOWING EVEN "STRATEGIC

901
00:27:57,433 --> 00:27:58,566
AMBIGUITY" HAS ITS PRICE.

902
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:01,233
BUT DESPITE U.S. ASSISTANCE, THE

903
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,300
TAIWAN MILITARY IS OBVIOUSLY A

904
00:28:02,366 --> 00:28:03,533
FRACTION OF CHINA'S.

905
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,566
AND ITS RECENT ATTEMPTS TO

906
00:28:04,633 --> 00:28:05,366
ATTRACT RECRUITS HAVE LEFT

907
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,866
SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED.

908
00:28:08,933 --> 00:28:10,300
 THE ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN

909
00:28:10,366 --> 00:28:11,966
PRODUCING VIDEOS LIKE THIS TO

910
00:28:12,033 --> 00:28:13,766
TRY TO DRUM UP ENTHUSIASM AMONG

911
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:15,466
POTENTIAL YOUNG SOLDIERS.

912
00:28:15,533 --> 00:28:16,533
BUT THEY'VE BEEN STRUGGLING TO

913
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,266
MAKE UP FOR A SHORTFALL LEFT BY

914
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,933
A PHASING OUT OF CONSCRIPTION.

915
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,300
OKAY, I'M NOT SURE

916
00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:24,133
THAT'S HELPING.

917
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,266
THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A GROUP

918
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:26,100
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE EXCITED TO BE

919
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:27,600
IN THE MILITARY.

920
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:28,266
IT LOOKS LIKE A BUNCH OF

921
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:29,600
BACKGROUND DANCERS WHO WERE CUT

922
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,100
FROM "IN THE HEIGHTS" BECAUSE

923
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:32,166
THEY WERE TOO BORING TO BE ON

924
00:28:32,233 --> 00:28:33,622
CAMERA.

925
00:28:33,647 --> 00:28:37,833
SO WHAT EXACTLY CAN OR SHOULD BE
DONE HERE?

926
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,633
WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING THE

927
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,600
ENTIRE WORLD HAS BEEN DISSECTING

928
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:41,833
FOR HALF A CENTURY NOW, AND SO

929
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,766
FAR THE ANSWER WE SEEM TO HAVE
SETTLED ON IS SOME VERSION OF,

930
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:45,433
"UH...

931
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,566
NEXT QUESTION, PLEASE," WHICH IS

932
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:50,166
CLEARLY NOT VERY SATISFYING.

933
00:28:50,233 --> 00:28:51,266
AND I KNOW AMBIGUITY IS

934
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:53,433
INHERENTLY FRUSTRATING,

935
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:54,666
ESPECIALLY FOR AMERICANS, WHO

936
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,766
MIGHT LOOK AT A PLACE LIKE

937
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:57,366
TAIWAN, WHICH LOOKS AND ACTS

938
00:28:57,433 --> 00:28:59,100
LIKE A COUNTRY, AND FEEL IT'S

939
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:00,833
WEIRD AND FARCICAL TO NOT

940
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,300
ACKNOWLEDGE IT AS ONE.

941
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,333
BUT FROM A PRACTICAL STANDPOINT,

942
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,133
WOULD THAT BE BETTER?

943
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,800
AND IS THAT EVEN WHAT THE PEOPLE

944
00:29:06,866 --> 00:29:08,966
OF TAIWAN WANT?

945
00:29:09,033 --> 00:29:10,233
COULD IT BE THAT MAINTAINING THE

946
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,466
CURRENT, DEEPLY WEIRD, AMBIGUOUS

947
00:29:11,533 --> 00:29:13,866
STATUS QUO IS ACTUALLY THE BEST

948
00:29:13,933 --> 00:29:15,333
OPTION?

949
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,566
I DON'T KNOW.

950
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:20,233
I'M NOT TAIWANESE, AND FRANKLY,

951
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,500
PEOPLE WHO AREN'T TAIWANESE

952
00:29:21,566 --> 00:29:24,266
MAKING DECISIONS FOR TAIWAN IS A

953
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:25,133
BIT FUCKING PLAYED OUT,

954
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,933
HISTORICALLY.

955
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,766
SO MAYBE THE BEST THING WE CAN

956
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:28,666
DO IS MOVE PAST TALKING ABOUT

957
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:29,300
TAIWAN LIKE IT'S SOME KIND OF

958
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:31,233
POKER CHIP IN A NEVER-ENDING

959
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,633
GAME OF US VS. THEM.

960
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,800
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, TAIWAN IS

961
00:29:34,866 --> 00:29:36,000
NOT A PLUCKY BULWARK AGAINST THE

962
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,400
RED MENACE, NOR IS IT SOME SORT

963
00:29:38,466 --> 00:29:39,700
OF ISLAND-SIZED VIAGRA TO

964
00:29:39,766 --> 00:29:44,000
REJUVENATE THE CHINESE NATION.

965
00:29:44,066 --> 00:29:45,400
TAIWAN IS 23 MILLION PEOPLE,

966
00:29:45,466 --> 00:29:47,266
WHO, IN THE FACE OF CONSIDERABLE

967
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,933
ODDS, HAVE BUILT A FREE,

968
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,533
DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, AND VERY

969
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,600
MUCH DESERVE THE RIGHT TO DECIDE

970
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,200
THEIR OWN FUTURE, IN ANY WAY

971
00:29:53,266 --> 00:29:56,300
THEY DEEM FIT, EVEN IF THAT

972
00:29:56,366 --> 00:30:00,000
MEANS SPORADICALLY BEATING THE

973
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:02,273
ABSOLUTE SHIT OUT OF EACH OTHER.
AND NOW THIS.

974
00:30:02,298 --> 00:30:05,431
 AND NOW, JAMES CORDEN

975
00:30:05,456 --> 00:30:08,458
JAMES CORDEN LOVES CINEMA.
