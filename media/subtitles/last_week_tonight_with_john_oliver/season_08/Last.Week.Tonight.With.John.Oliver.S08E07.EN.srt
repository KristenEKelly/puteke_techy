1
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,433
HI THERE!

2
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,540
WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL

3
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,200
TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK VOID.

4
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:33,166
IT'S GOT WHITE WALLS,

5
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,276
A GLASS TABLE, AND A BIG DORK

6
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:34,900
BEHIND THE COUNTER.

7
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:36,300
THIS IS BASICALLY AN APPLE STORE

8
00:00:36,366 --> 00:00:38,033
THAT ONLY SELLS SADNESS.

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,233
NOW WE WERE OFF LAST WEEK,

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,100
AND A LOT HAS HAPPENED

11
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,433
SINCE WE LAST SPOKE.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,540
THE TRIAL GOT UNDERWAY FOR

13
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:44,266
DEREK CHAUVIN, WHOSE ENTIRE

14
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:45,573
DEFENSE SEEMS TO BE, "SEE, WHAT

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,866
HAD HAPPENED WAS..."

16
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:48,633
IN EGYPT, BIG BOAT GOT STUCK.

17
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,733
THEN, BIG BOAT GOT UNSTUCK.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,033
AND FOR A FEW DAYS,

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,833
RIGHT-WING MEDIA LOST THEIR

20
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,166
COLLECTIVE MINDS OVER

21
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:57,233
LIL NAS X'S NEW MUSIC VIDEO.

22
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,533
I COULD DESCRIBE IT TO YOU,

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,640
BUT I THINK I'D RATHER LET

24
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,733
RUDY GIULIANI DO IT INSTEAD.

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,833
IT BEGINS WITH THE... THIS...

26
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,733
WHATEVER HE IS... THIS GUY, UH,

27
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,666
LITTLE NAS, BEING SEDUCED BY THE

28
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:13,666
DEVIL IN THE FORM OF A SNAKE.

29
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:17,533
AND THEN HE ENGAGES IN A... THIS

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,733
RIDICULOUS, REALLY, RATHER UGLY

31
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,366
DANCE WITH SATAN AND

32
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:25,566
IT'S A SEXUAL DANCE.

33
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:27,566
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF

34
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:28,266
IT I SHOULD DESCRIBE, EXCEPT YOU

35
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:31,200
GOTTA GET IT.

36
00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:32,276
IT'S... UM, HE, UM, LAP DANCES

37
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,233
HIM.

38
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,633
OH, COME ON, RUDY.

39
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,566
DON'T GIVE US THAT SURPRISED

40
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:36,933
FACE.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,433
YOU CAN'T PRETEND TO BE

42
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,800
A TOTAL STRANGER TO LAP DANCES

43
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,533
IN THE SAME OSCAR SEASON THAT

44
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,866
YOU'RE NOMINATED FOR

45
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:44,013
"BEST JUNK ADJUSTMENT WHILE

46
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:45,366
LYING ON A STRANGER'S BED."

47
00:01:45,433 --> 00:01:47,333
"LAP DANCES" IS

48
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,600
UNDERSTATING THINGS

49
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,333
CONSIDERABLY THERE.

50
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,600
LIL NAS X SPENDS AN EXQUISITE

51
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:52,466
AMOUNT OF TIME THROWING IT BACK

52
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:54,333
AT THE ADVERSARY.

53
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,833
OLD SCRATCH IS GETTING GROUND ON

54
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,366
THERE LIKE AN OLIVE GARDEN

55
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:58,233
PEPPER MILL.

56
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,033
THE WHOLE VIDEO IS COMPLETELY

57
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,200
INCREDIBLE, AND FRANKLY,

58
00:02:01,266 --> 00:02:02,700
THE ONLY THING THAT COULD

59
00:02:02,766 --> 00:02:03,866
POSSIBLY MAKE IT MORE

60
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:04,666
ENTERTAINING IS WATCHING A

61
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:06,033
WEIRD, OLD CREEP TRY TO DESCRIBE

62
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,366
IT IN G-RATED TERMS WHILE

63
00:02:07,433 --> 00:02:08,366
SITTING ON THE SET OF A LAW FIRM

64
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:09,866
COMMERCIAL.

65
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:11,800
IT'S NOT THE FIRST REMIX I

66
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:12,566
EXPECTED, BUT I AM GLAD IT

67
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15,000
EXISTS.

68
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:16,500
BUT LIL NAS X TWERKING ON SATAN

69
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:17,966
SEEMS POSITIVELY WHOLESOME

70
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:20,333
COMPARED TO THE NEWS THIS WEEK

71
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,700
CONCERNING MATT GAETZ...

72
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,833
A SENTIENT LL BEAN PREMIUM

73
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,100
DOUBLE L TRADITIONAL FIT POLO.

74
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:25,633
GAETZ IS BEING INVESTIGATED FOR

75
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,933
POTENTIALLY VIOLATING

76
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,233
SEX-TRAFFICKING LAWS INVOLVING

77
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,766
A MINOR... SOMETHING HE DENIES,

78
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,500
CLAIMING THERE'S ACTUALLY

79
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:33,846
A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR EXTORTION

80
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,166
PLOT BEHIND THE INVESTIGATION.

81
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:39,276
HE EVEN WENT ON TUCKER CARLSON'S

82
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,400
SHOW TO EXPLAIN HIS THEORY,

83
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:41,800
UNSUCCESSFULLY.

84
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:44,133
YOU SAY THAT IT WAS... THAT

85
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,800
IT WAS OR IS UNDERWAY, THERE WAS

86
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:46,100
AN INVESTIGATION.

87
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:46,700
WHAT IS THE BASIS OF THAT

88
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,166
INVESTIGATION?

89
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:49,533
WHAT IS THE ALLEGATION?

90
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,766
THAT'S REALLY NOT VERY CLEAR

91
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,666
FROM THESE NEWS STORIES.

92
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:54,466
YEAH.

93
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:55,576
AGAIN, I ONLY KNOW WHAT I'VE

94
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,533
READ IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES."

95
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,200
I CAN SAY THAT ACTUALLY

96
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:00,200
YOU AND I WENT TO DINNER

97
00:03:00,266 --> 00:03:00,900
ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO,

98
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:02,033
YOUR WIFE WAS THERE,

99
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,309
AND I BROUGHT A FRIEND OF MINE.

100
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,700
YOU'LL REMEMBER HER.

101
00:03:05,766 --> 00:03:07,300
AND SHE WAS ACTUALLY THREATENED

102
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:09,866
BY THE FBI, TOLD THAT IF SHE

103
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:11,666
WOULDN'T COP TO THE FACT THAT

104
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,366
SOMEHOW I WAS INVOLVED IN SOME

105
00:03:13,433 --> 00:03:14,333
PAY FOR PLAY SCHEME, THAT SHE

106
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,700
COULD FACE TROUBLE.

107
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:16,909
I DON'T REMEMBER THE WOMAN

108
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:17,933
YOU'RE SPEAKING OF OR

109
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:19,126
THE CONTEXT AT ALL, HONESTLY.

110
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,100
WOW.

111
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,900
IMAGINE BEING THE ONE WHITE MAN

112
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:23,866
ON EARTH THAT TUCKER CARLSON

113
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:27,733
WON'T DEFEND.

114
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,876
TUCKER WAS SO CLEARLY TRYING TO

115
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,733
NOPE HIS WAY OUT OF THAT

116
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,433
WHOLE INTERVIEW.

117
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,866
HE LOOKS LIKE HE WANTS TO WALK

118
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:35,933
OUT OF HIS OWN SHOW.

119
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:36,666
THE PROBLEM IS, IF HE DID,

120
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:37,400
IT WOULDN'T BE

121
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:38,466
"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT"

122
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:39,542
ANYMORE, IT'D BE "THE MATT GAETZ

123
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:40,200
DIGS HIS OWN GRAVE ADVENTURE

124
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:41,300
HOUR."

125
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:42,033
LOOK, I'M SURE THERE'LL BE MORE

126
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,733
TO DISCUSS ABOUT THIS STORY

127
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,966
LATER, PROBABLY DURING

128
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:46,200
MATT GAETZ'S SENTENCING PHASE,

129
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:48,000
BUT FOR NOW, LET'S MOVE ONTO

130
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:49,466
AMAZON, A COMPANY RUN BY

131
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:51,100
JEFF BEZOS, WHO ANSWERS

132
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:51,766
THE QUESTION "WHAT IF LEX LUTHOR

133
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:52,866
WAS?"

134
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,166
AND THAT'S IT.

135
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,133
JUST "WHAT IF LEX LUTHOR WAS?"

136
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,242
HE'S A BALD BUSINESS MANIAC WITH

137
00:03:57,266 --> 00:03:58,800
TOO MUCH MONEY, ZERO EMPATHY,

138
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:00,400
AND WEIRD SUPERVILLAIN VEHICLES.

139
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:02,366
HE'S JUST LEX LUTHOR.

140
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:04,333
THIS WEEK, COUNTING BEGAN ON

141
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,900
A HISTORIC UNION VOTE BY WORKERS

142
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:07,076
AT AN AMAZON FULFILLMENT CENTER

143
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,566
IN BESSEMER, ALABAMA.

144
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:10,066
THE DRIVE HAS BEEN SEEN

145
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:11,633
AS A BELLWETHER FOR THE LABOR

146
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,776
MOVEMENT AS A WHOLE, AND AMAZON

147
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,366
WORKERS FRANKLY HAVE PLENTY OF

148
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:16,400
REASONS TO FIGHT TO UNIONIZE.

149
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:18,300
MANY COMPLAIN ABOUT GRUELING

150
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:19,666
WORK, UNSAFE CONDITIONS, WITH

151
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:20,400
INADEQUATE BATHROOM AND MEAL

152
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:22,766
BREAKS.

153
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,200
THEY TREAT YOU MORE LIKE A

154
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:25,166
PRODUCT OR A STATISTIC THAN AN

155
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:26,866
ACTUAL HUMAN BEING.

156
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,566
FOR EXAMPLE, I'M A DIABETIC AND

157
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:29,709
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO STOP TO

158
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:32,266
CHECK MY BLOOD SUGAR.

159
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,400
THEY HAVE JUST CONSTANT QUOTAS,

160
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:36,166
AND IF YOU CAN'T GET DONE WHAT

161
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:38,633
THEY WANT YOU TO GET DONE,

162
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,266
THEN YOU HAVE NO WORTH INSIDE OF

163
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,133
THEIR SYSTEM.

164
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,366
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

165
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:44,966
AND THE FACT AMAZON WORKERS ARE

166
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:47,866
DEMORALIZED IS SOMETHING YOU

167
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:48,466
KNEW, BUT IT DOESN'T GET ANY

168
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:49,333
LESS UPSETTING NO MATTER HOW

169
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,566
MANY TIMES YOU'RE REMINDED.

170
00:04:50,633 --> 00:04:52,033
IT'S LIKE HEARING THAT

171
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,266
DENNIS QUAID'S NEW WIFE IS

172
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,000
YOUNGER THAN HIS SON, OR THAT

173
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:56,600
HELENA BONHAM CARTER HAS NEVER

174
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,566
WON AN OSCAR, OR THAT NO ONE HAS

175
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:00,233
EVER CLEANED A SINGLE WATERPARK.

176
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,342
SERIOUSLY, WHEN HAS A WATERPARK

177
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:03,533
EVER FELT CLEAN TO YOU?

178
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,866
OPEN-TO-CLOSE, IT'S FULL OF

179
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:06,433
FILTHY KIDS PISSING THEMSELVES

180
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,900
DOWN SCALDING PLASTIC SLIDES

181
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:09,733
INTO RECYCLED WATER AND

182
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,080
NIGHT TIME IS WHEN THE EMPLOYEES

183
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:12,166
FUCK IN THE TUBES.

184
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:15,033
HOW WOULD CLEANING IT EVEN WORK?

185
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,033
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO,

186
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,733
DRAIN THE LAZY RIVER

187
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,466
EVERY NIGHT?

188
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:18,133
OF COURSE NOT.

189
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,242
YOU'RE SWIMMING IN THE PISS OF

190
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:20,066
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, MANY OF

191
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:20,666
WHOM HAVE LONG SINCE DIED.

192
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:23,166
JUST DEAL WITH IT.

193
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:26,000
AND WHILE WE DON'T KNOW

194
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:28,666
THE RESULTS OF THIS VOTE YET,

195
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:29,833
IT IS WORTH LOOKING AT JUST

196
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,700
HOW HARD AMAZON HAS FOUGHT IT.

197
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,533
THEY'VE APPARENTLY BEEN SENDING

198
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,166
WORKERS UP TO FIVE TEXT MESSAGES

199
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:37,766
PER DAY DISCOURAGING THEM FROM

200
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,300
JOINING A UNION; THEY'VE ALSO

201
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:40,409
HELD MANDATORY MEETINGS THAT

202
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:41,633
DISPARAGE UNIONIZATION,

203
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,433
AND THEN THERE'S THIS:

204
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,709
SOMETHING I HAVE NEVER, EVER

205
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:44,666
SEEN BEFORE IN WRITING ABOUT

206
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:46,200
LABOR FOR 25, 30 YEARS,

207
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:47,566
THEY HAVE ANTI-UNION POSTERS

208
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:48,800
IN THE BATHROOM STALLS.

209
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:50,266
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GO TO THE

210
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:50,866
BATHROOM, WHO WANT TO LOOK AT

211
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:55,133
THAT?

212
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
YEHA, NOBODY!

213
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:56,733
NOBODY WANTS TO LOOK AT THAT

214
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,700
POSTER IN THE BATHROOM.

215
00:05:57,766 --> 00:05:58,900
THE ONLY THING WORSE TO SEE

216
00:05:58,966 --> 00:05:59,733
WHILE YOU'RE TAKING A DUMP

217
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,666
IN A WORKPLACE BATHROOM STALL IS

218
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:02,500
AN EMPTY TOILET PAPER ROLL,

219
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:04,066
OR KEVIN SPACEY.

220
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:04,966
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

221
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:09,566
GET OUT!

222
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:11,700
I'M SHITTING, KEVIN!

223
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:12,566
AND SPEAKING OF BATHROOM BREAKS,

224
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:14,033
WE'VE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT HOW,

225
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,342
WORKERS HAVE SAID THEY'VE HAD TO

226
00:06:15,366 --> 00:06:16,033
FOREGO THEM TO KEEP UP WITH

227
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,766
CRUSHING QUOTAS.

228
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,400
AND SOME DELIVERY DRIVERS HAVE

229
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:19,400
REPORTEDLY RESORTED TO URINATING

230
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:23,400
IN BOTTLES.

231
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,133
AND JUST THIS WEEK, "THE

232
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,966
INTERCEPT" PUBLISHED AN INTERNAL

00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:26,766

INSIDE."

238
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:34,066
SOMETHING ALMOST TOO AWFUL TO

239
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:36,000
COMPREHEND, AS TWO OF NEW YORK'S

240
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:36,900
MORNING NEWS ANCHORS CONVEYED IN

241
00:06:36,966 --> 00:06:38,733
REAL TIME.

242
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,933
IN SOME CASES, EMPLOYEES

243
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,366
DEFECATING IN BAGS.

244
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,733
COME ON!

245
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,566
IT'S MORNING TIME.

246
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:44,809
PEOPLE ARE HAVING THEIR COFFEE

247
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,833
AND CEREAL RIGHT NOW.

248
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,133
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS,

249
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,133
LAURIE, I'M NOT SO INTERESTED IN

250
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,366
KNOWING ALL THE DETAILS.

251
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:52,166
WHAT, BECAUSE THEN THEY COME

252
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:52,900
AND DELIVER YOUR PACKAGE?

253
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:53,566
YEAH.

254
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:54,433
YEAH, IT'S A REVOLTING

255
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,100
STORY.

256
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,600
NOBODY WANTS TO ENDURE A BAG OF

257
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,000
SHIT OVER BREAKFAST.

258
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:00,066
THAT'S WHY PIERS MORGAN

259
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,166
NO LONGER HAS A JOB.

260
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:03,342
AND LOOK, I GET NOT WANTING TO

261
00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:04,733
KNOW DETAILS ABOUT THINGS.

262
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,533
AS A GENERAL RULE,

263
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,760
I DON'T NEED TO KNOW HOW MOST

264
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,433
THINGS GET DONE.

265
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,900
BUT I DO MAKE AN EXCEPTION

266
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:11,433
IF ONE OF THE STEPS INVOLVES

267
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,866
SOMEONE HAVING TO SHIT IN A BAG.

268
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,633
THAT GOES FOR ANY PROCESS.

269
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,600
I'M NOT REALLY ALL THAT

270
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,200
INTERESTED IN HOW

271
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:18,733
AN ORIGAMI CRANE GETS MADE,

272
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,266
BUT IF YOU TOLD ME ONE OF THE

273
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,453
STEPS INVOLVED YOU HAVING TO

274
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,033
SHIT IN A BAG, I'M GOING TO NEED

275
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,700
A DETAILED, STEP-BY-STEP LOOK

276
00:07:23,766 --> 00:07:24,766
INTO THE PROCEDURE.

277
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:25,766
BECAUSE SOMETHING HORRENDOUS

278
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,100
IS CLEARLY HAPPENING THERE.

279
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,242
AND THE FACT IS, WE DO HAVE TO

280
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:31,733
KEEP PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS.

281
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,700
BECAUSE THE OUTCOME OF

282
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:34,000
BESSEMER'S VOTE WILL HAVE

283
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:35,800
MAJOR IMPLICATIONS.

284
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:36,800
AMAZON IS THE SECOND LARGEST

285
00:07:36,866 --> 00:07:39,300
PRIVATE EMPLOYER IN AMERICA.

286
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:40,733
AND THIS UNIONIZING EFFORT

287
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,233
COULD DETERMINE WHETHER THEIR

288
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,133
EMPLOYEES HAVE THE POWER TO

289
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,000
DEMAND DECENT WORKING

290
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:45,500
CONDITIONS.

291
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,533
AND THE HARDER THE COMPANY TRIES

292
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,800
TO CONVINCE THEIR WORKERS THAT

293
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:50,166
THEY DON'T NEED UNION

294
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:51,633
PROTECTION, THE CLEARER IT

295
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,100
BECOMES THAT AMAZON EXECUTIVES

296
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,276
...MUCH LIKE THE BAGS THAT ARE

297
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,376
APPARENTLY LYING AROUND THEIR

298
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,033
DELIVERY VEHICLES... ARE

299
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,766
COMPLETELY FULL OF SHIT.

300
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:00,833
AND NOW, THIS.

301
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:02,533
AND NOW...

302
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,666
SOME VERY UNWELCOME NEWS

303
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:09,500
REGARDING PEEPS.

304
00:08:09,566 --> 00:08:10,700
PEEPS AND PEPSI?

305
00:08:10,766 --> 00:08:12,600
THE TWO ARE COLLABORATING ON A

306
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:16,166
MARSHMALLOW FLAVORED SODA.

307
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:17,466
B WHERE!

308
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:20,166
THE PEEPS HAVE ALLIED WITH THE

309
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,933
VILE PEPSI CORPORATION!

310
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,400
AND UNHOLY LIQUID!

311
00:08:22,466 --> 00:08:26,933
WE CANNOT TALK ABOUT PEEPS

312
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,133
PEPSI.

313
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,033
HE LIES!

314
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,200
IT IS COMPLETELY WITHIN HIS

315
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:31,133
POWERS TO SIMPLY NOT TO MENTION

316
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,300
IT!

317
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:32,409
THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET A

318
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:34,933
DRINK IS THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA,

319
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,600
AND A PROMOTION THAT IS GOING ON

320
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,433

00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:44,466
I SWEAR TO GOD, IF YOU USE

324
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:46,333
THE HASHTAG HANGING WITH MY

325
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,066
PEEPS, I WILL BREAK INTO YOUR

HOUSE!

327
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:53,966
THE PEPSI PEEPS PARTNERSHIP

00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,333
YOUR FAVORITE THING, I'M

MIX IT TOGETHER, IF THEY DON'T

00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:12,400
WIN THE PROMOTION.

341
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:14,266
THAT MIGHT ALSO LEAD TO BAD

342
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,866
THINGS.

343
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:18,700
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CREATE YOUR

344
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:19,566
OWN PEEPS FLAVORED BEVERAGE.

345
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:20,533
THE ONLY FLAVOR YOU WILL CREATE

346
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,733
IS SORROW!

347
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,900

00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:25,976
PARTNERSHIP WITH PEPSI, PEEPS IS

349
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,533
CONTINUING TO GET INTO THE DRINK

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,166
MARKET.

353

NO!

354
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,366
NOT A LATTE!

355
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:39,966
EVERYTHING BUT A BREAKFAST LATT

356
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:41,100
LATTE!

357
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,000
MOVING ON.

358
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:43,433
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

359
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,366
THE NATIONAL DEBT... THE WORLD'S

360
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:46,900
MOST BORING $28 TRILLION.

361
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:47,866
AND I KNOW, JUST SAYING

362
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:48,400
"$28 TRILLION" MIGHT SOUND

363
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:49,400
CONFUSING.

364
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:51,133
HOW MUCH IS THAT, EXACTLY?

365
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,500
WELL, TO PUT IT ONE WAY:

366
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:53,633
IT'S $28 TRILLION.

367
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,266
TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY,

368
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,500
IT'S 28 MILLION MILLIONS.

369
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:57,400
TO PUT IT A THIRD WAY, IT'S

370
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:59,500
AN ABSOLUTE FUCK-TON OF MONEY.

371
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:03,233
BUT REGARDLESS, THE NATIONAL

372
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,200
DEBT IS A COMPLETE OBSESSION

373
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:05,000
IN THIS COUNTRY.

374
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:06,209
HERE IN NEW YORK, WE EVEN HAVE

375
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:06,800
A DEBT CLOCK THAT COUNTS UP

376
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:07,866
IN REAL TIME.

377
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:09,066
IT ACTUALLY MADE HEADLINES

378
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:10,733
A LITTLE OVER A DECADE AGO WHEN

379
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,233
THE DEBT HIT FOURTEEN DIGITS.

380
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,866
THE NATIONAL DEBT JUST PASSED

381
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:15,833
$10 TRILLION, SO THE CLOCK'S

382
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,500
CARETAKERS HAD TO SQUEEZE A ONE

383
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:18,466
AND THE DOLLAR SIGN INTO THE

384
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:19,833
SAME SQUARE.

385
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,800
IT'S PRETTY SCARY.

386
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:23,533
IT'S A PRETTY BIG NUMBER.

387
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,300
INCOMPREHENSIBLE.

388
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:26,433
IT'S TOO BIG.

389
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,900
THE CLOCK WAS PUT UP IN 1989

390
00:10:28,966 --> 00:10:30,233
BY HELENA DURST'S GRANDFATHER

391
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,409
WHEN THE NATIONAL DEBT WAS JUST

392
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:33,166
UNDER $3 TRILLION.

393
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,700
NOW THAT THE DEBT HAS PASSED

394
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:36,333
THE $10 TRILLION MARK, DURST

395
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:36,933
LIKES TO RECITE A POEM BY HER

396
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,833
GRANDFATHER.

397
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,500
BORROW, BORROW, BORROW.

398
00:10:40,566 --> 00:10:41,433
ENJOY TODAY AND TOMORROW,

399
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,576
FOR TOMORROW IS GOING TO BE

400
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,200
TERRIBLE.

401
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:45,433
I'M SORRY, BUT THAT

402
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,700
POEM SUCKS.

403
00:10:46,766 --> 00:10:47,933
THE RHYME SCHEME'S ALL OVER

404
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,600
THE PLACE, AND IF TOMORROW'S

405
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,466
GOING TO BE TERRIBLE, WHY WOULD

406
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:51,366
YOU ENJOY IT?

407
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:52,509
THAT WAS CLEARLY THE WORK OF

408
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:54,133
A MAN ALMOST AS GOOD AT WRITING

409
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,209
POETRY AS HE WAS AT RAISING

410
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:56,033
CHILDREN WHO AREN'T

411
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,000
SERIAL KILLERS.

412
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:59,533
OH, YEAH... THE CLOCK WAS PUT UP

413
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,433
BY THAT DURST FAMILY.

414
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,966
THE BATHROOM MURDER BURP DURSTS.

415
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:05,033
SO THANKS VERY MUCH FOR

416
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,000
THE DUMB CLOCK THAT DOESN'T

417
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:07,766
TELL TIME, YOU WEALTHY

418
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,133
BATHROOM MURDER BURPERS.

419
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,700
BUT THE TRUTH IS,

420
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:13,133
OUR NATIONAL DEBT IS UNDENIABLY

421
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,966
BIG, AND BETWEEN THE TRILLIONS

422
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:16,200
IN CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS BILLS

423
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:17,133
AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE PLANS

424
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,800
BIDEN UNVEILED JUST THIS WEEK,

425
00:11:18,866 --> 00:11:20,366
IT'S POISED TO GET EVEN BIGGER.

426
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:21,366
AND REPUBLICANS, IN PARTICULAR,

427
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:24,766
SEEM OUTRAGED ABOUT THAT.

428
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,133
THIS CHART SHOWING DEBT IS

429
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,666
NOT JUST ABOUT THE BIG NUMBER.

430
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:30,333
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT

431
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,366
THE $30 TRILLION OF DEBT.

432
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:35,600
THIS IS ABOUT TYRANNY.

433
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:36,333
HISTORY IS SCREAMING THIS

434
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,333
WARNING AT US.

435
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,266
COUNTRIES THAT BANKRUPT

436
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,966
THEMSELVES AND DESTROY THEIR

437
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,666
ECONOMIES SIMPLY AREN'T AROUND

438
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:43,100
VERY LONG.

439
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,666
THERE WILL BE A DAY OF

440
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:46,600
RECKONING, A DEBT CRISIS.

441
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,000
AND IT WON'T BE PRETTY.

442
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:50,233
DEFICITS DO MATTER.

443
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,566
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOUR

444
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:53,833
FAMILY WOULD LAST IF EVERY

445
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,333
MONTH, YOU SPENT MORE AND MORE

446
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:55,966
ON THE CREDIT CARD AND MADE THE

447
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:57,066
MINIMUM PAYMENT?

448
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,100
NOT LONG.

449
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:03,433
LOOK, I KNOW THAT ALL

450
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,066
SOUNDS PRETTY SCARY, BUT FOR

451
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:05,133
WHAT IT'S WORTH,

452
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,176
THE NATIONAL DEBT IS NOTHING

453
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,966
LIKE A CREDIT CARD.

454
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:08,466
FOR A START, WE DON'T HAVE

455
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:09,573
28 TRILLION AIRLINE MILES,

456
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:10,566
NOR DO WE GET LETTERS

457
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:11,566
IN THE MAIL EVERY DAY SAYING

458
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:12,166
WE'RE PREAPPROVED FOR

459
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:15,200
A BRAND NEW NATIONAL DEBT.

460
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:15,800
LEAVE US ALONE, YOU FUCKING

461
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:16,866
PARASITES!

462
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,009
BUT IF WE HAVE HUGE CLOCKS TO

463
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:19,193
MEASURE IT, WE'RE CONSIDERING

464
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:20,700
AN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL THAT

465
00:12:20,766 --> 00:12:21,909
COULD ADD TWO TRILLION TO IT,

466
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:23,433
AND SOME ARE IMPLYING THAT OUR

467
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,300
CREDITORS COULD BE TURNING UP

468
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:25,900
ANY DAY NOW WITH A BASEBALL BAT

469
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:27,533
TO REPOSSESS OUR BRIDGES AND

470
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,800
DAMS BECAUSE OF IT, WE THOUGHT

471
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,200
TONIGHT MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME TO

472
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:31,566
TALK ABOUT THE NATIONAL DEBT:

473
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:33,400
HOW IT WORKS, HOW VALID CONCERNS

474
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:35,466
ABOUT IT ARE, AND HOW WE SHOULD

475
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:36,833
THINK ABOUT IT MOVING FORWARD.

476
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,600
AND LET'S START WITH THE BASICS,

477
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:39,833
LIKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

478
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,366
THE DEBT AND A DEFICIT.

479
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:43,000
A COUNTRY RUNS A DEFICIT WHEN

480
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:44,333
IT SPENDS MORE MONEY ON THINGS

481
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:44,833
LIKE THE MILITARY,

482
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,233
SOCIAL PROGRAMS,

483
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,600
AND EVERYTHING ELSE THE

484
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:48,500
GOVERNMENT DOES... THAN IT

485
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:49,576
BRINGS IN... MOSTLY THROUGH

486
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,833
TAXES.

487
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,066
NOW, TO PAY FOR A DEFICIT,

488
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:53,600
THE GOVERNMENT THEN BORROWS

489
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,700
MONEY, THUS ACCRUING DEBT.

490
00:12:55,766 --> 00:12:57,400
SO THE DEFICIT IS A YEARLY

491
00:12:57,466 --> 00:12:58,400
MEASUREMENT OF HOW MUCH WE'RE

492
00:12:58,466 --> 00:12:59,466
IN THE RED.

493
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,500
AND THE DEBT IS THE TOTAL AMOUNT

494
00:13:01,566 --> 00:13:02,400
THAT WE OWE, ACCUMULATED OVER

495
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:03,900
TIME.

496
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:05,333
AND FOR DECADES, IN POLITICAL

497
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,033
ADS, THE DEBT HAS BEEN PORTRAYED

498
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,500
AS A BURDEN WE'RE PLACING ON

499
00:13:08,566 --> 00:13:09,700
FUTURE GENERATIONS.

500
00:13:09,766 --> 00:13:11,466
BASICALLY, MAKING THAT ARGUMENT

501
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:13,000
THAT WE'RE RUNNING UP THEIR

502
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:14,700
CREDIT CARD, AND ONE DAY,

503
00:13:14,766 --> 00:13:15,876
THE BILL'S GOING TO COME DUE.

504
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,700
YOU OWE THE UNITED STATES

505
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:20,233
GOVERNMENT, IN ROUND NUMBERS,

506
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,833
$50,000.

507
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,940
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE FOR

508
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
CHRISTMAS?

509
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:27,366
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO FIX THE

510
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:29,266
DEBT, SO I CAN HAVE A FUTURE.

511
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,533
I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO

512
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,000
AMERICA'S DEBT, AND THE CHINESE

513
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,733
GOVERNMENT THAT LENDS US MONEY.

514
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,333
CONGRESS MUST STOP DIGGING

515
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,166
A DEEP HOLE OF DEBT THAT WE'LL

516
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:41,433
NEVER GET OUT OF.

517
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,966
PLEASE STOP DIGGING.

518
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:46,100
YEAH, PRETTY DRAMATIC.

519
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,733
CRYING BABIES, EXASPERATED

520
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,433
SANTAS, AND EVEN A CHILD

521
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,700
WATCHING UNCLE SAM

522
00:13:49,766 --> 00:13:51,800
DIGGING A GRAVE.

523
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:53,733
AND QUICK PIECE OF ADVICE, KIDS.

524
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,166
IF YOU DO SEE A MAN IN ANY KIND

525
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:56,133
OF COSTUME DIGGING A LARGE HOLE

526
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,242
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT,

527
00:13:57,266 --> 00:13:58,600
DO NOT APPROACH HIM.

528
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,033
DO NOT INTERFERE WITH HIS

529
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,300
DIGGING.

530
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:02,266
I'M NOT SAYING HE SHOULD BE

531
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,100
DOING THAT.

532
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,433
I'M SAYING YOU'RE NOT THE ONE

533
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,866
WHO SHOULD TRY TO STOP HIM.

534
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:07,000
IF HE'S WILLING TO DIG

535
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:08,366
A BIG HOLE, HE'S WILLING TO DIG

536
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:08,900
A SMALL ONE.

537
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:10,400
RUN AWAY AND TELL AN ADULT.

538
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:13,333
A NON-COSTUMED ADULT.

539
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,666
BUT ADS LIKE THOSE ARE WILDLY

540
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:16,233
MISLEADING.

541
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,833
FOR INSTANCE, THAT PLEDGE OF

542
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,909
ALLEGIANCE AD TALKED ABOUT HOW

543
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:19,966
MUCH WE OWE THE CHINESE

544
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:23,266
GOVERNMENT.

545
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,033
THAT IS SOMETHING YOU HEAR A

546
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,833
LOT.

547
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,633
BUT FOR THE RECORD, THE MAJORITY

548
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,600
OF GOVERNMENT DEBT IS ACTUALLY

549
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,786
OWNED BY AMERICAN INVESTORS.

550
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,266
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE A

551
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,533
PENSION, YOU MIGHT OWN SOME OF

552
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:33,700
THAT DEBT IN THE FORM OF

553
00:14:33,766 --> 00:14:34,966
GOVERNMENT BONDS, BECAUSE

554
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:36,033
THEY'RE A PRETTY SAFE

555
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:37,066
INVESTMENT.

556
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:38,933
FOREIGN INVESTORS ONLY OWN

557
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,200
AROUND A THIRD OF OUR DEBT.

558
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:42,542
AND WHILE, YES, IT'S TRUE, CHINA

559
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:43,866
DOES OWN OVER A TRILLION DOLLARS

560
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:50,300
OF IT, WHICH ISN'T NOTHING...

561
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:51,066
IT'S AROUND 5%...

562
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:52,066
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

563
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:53,209
THEY'RE NOT EVEN OUR LARGEST

564
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:54,166
FOREIGN CREDITOR... JAPAN IS.

565
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:55,466
AND WHILE THE DEBT IS OFTEN

566
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:56,542
TALKED ABOUT AS BEING SOMETHING

567
00:14:56,566 --> 00:14:57,500
WE'RE RUNNING UP WITH NEW

568
00:14:57,566 --> 00:14:58,766
SPENDING, THE TRUTH IS, BEFORE

569
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,066
THE PANDEMIC HIT, MOST OF OUR

570
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:00,633
DEBT WAS THE RESULT OF LONG,

571
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,266
STEADY GROWTH IN PROGRAMS

572
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,342
THAT WE'D LONG AGO COMMITTED TO,

573
00:15:04,366 --> 00:15:05,200
LIKE MEDICARE AND OTHER

574
00:15:05,266 --> 00:15:06,600
ENTITLEMENTS.

575
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:07,942
SO WE'RE VERY MUCH GETTING STUFF

576
00:15:07,966 --> 00:15:10,966
FOR THE MONEY WE'RE SPENDING.

577
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:12,142
AND THAT ACTUALLY BRINGS US TO

578
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,366
A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT HERE:

579
00:15:14,433 --> 00:15:15,900
GOING INTO DEBT CAN ACTUALLY BE

580
00:15:15,966 --> 00:15:16,766
A GOOD INVESTMENT FOR THE

581
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,066
COUNTRY.

582
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:19,373
ESSENTIALLY, AS ECONOMISTS WILL

583
00:15:19,433 --> 00:15:20,733
TELL YOU, THE KEY QUESTION IS,

584
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,233
"ARE YOU SPENDING MONEY ON THE

585
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,333
RIGHT THINGS?"

586
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,900
WE NEED TO THINK OF THE DEBT.

587
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,206
ARE YOU CREATING MONEY FOR REAL

588
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:29,166
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY?

589
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:30,800
IF YOU'RE DOING THAT JUST TO

590
00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:31,666
GIVE SOMEBODY MONEY, THEN, YEAH,

591
00:15:31,733 --> 00:15:34,900
YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM.

592
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:37,633
BUT IF I'M A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL

593
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,300
AND I GO TO THE BANK AND SAY,

594
00:15:39,366 --> 00:15:40,300
"I GOT THIS WONDERFUL NEW IDEA.

595
00:15:40,366 --> 00:15:41,066
I JUST NEED THE MONEY TO BUILD

596
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:42,800
MY FACTORY."

597
00:15:42,866 --> 00:15:43,900
NOBODY SAYS, "OH, THAT'S

598
00:15:43,966 --> 00:15:44,633
HORRIBLE."

599
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,742
YOU JUST INCREASED THE MONEY

600
00:15:45,766 --> 00:15:47,200
SUPPLY.

601
00:15:47,266 --> 00:15:48,433
BECAUSE WE ALL GO, YEAH, BUT

602
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:48,933
THERE'S A FACTORY THERE.

603
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
IT'S A REAL THING.

604
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:51,600
RIGHT.

605
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,000
TAKING ON DEBT TO BUILD A

606
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:55,000
FACTORY THAT CREATES JOBS AND

607
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:56,300
INCREASES ECONOMIC OUTPUT

608
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:57,900
IS PROBABLY A SMART INVESTMENT.

609
00:15:57,966 --> 00:15:59,009
ESPECIALLY IF IT'S ONE THAT

610
00:15:59,033 --> 00:16:00,300
MAKES THIS ACTUAL PILLOWCASE

611
00:16:00,366 --> 00:16:01,966
DEPICTING A NUDE NICOLAS CAGE

612
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:03,109
LOUNGING IN A BANANA PEEL WITH

613
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:03,966
TWO GIANT FOXES IN THE

614
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:05,033
BACKGROUND.

615
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:07,033
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS THING!

616
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,933
AS THE DESCRIPTION SAYS, IT HAS

617
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,800
AN "OPHISTICATED SEAM" WITH

618
00:16:10,866 --> 00:16:12,200
"STYLISH STYLE," AND I'M MORE

619
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:13,933
THAN HAPPY TO COSIGN ON BOTH OF

620
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,400
THOSE CLAIMS.

621
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:17,666
AND THE REASON IS, YOU CAN

622
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:18,966
CONSIDER ME A SATISFIED

623
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:20,033
CUSTOMER.

624
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:21,266
I FEEL SO MUCH MORE

625
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,233
OPHISTICATED!

626
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,833
THE POINT IS, REPUBLICANS LOVE

627
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,909
TO ARGUE THAT GOVERNMENT SHOULD

628
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:29,266
BE RUN LIKE A BUSINESS, BUT TEND

629
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,566
TO CONVENIENTLY FORGET THAT SOME

630
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:33,033
EXTREMELY VALUABLE COMPANIES GOT

631
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,600
THAT WAY, IN PART, BECAUSE THEY

632
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,066
HAD LONG PERIODS WHERE THEY

633
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:37,373
SPENT A SHITLOAD MORE THAN THEY

634
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:39,033
TOOK IN.

635
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,466
SO AS YOU CAN SEE, ALREADY,

636
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:43,933
THINGS ARE A LOT MORE NUANCED

637
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,766
THAN SIMPLY, "HEY, UNCLE SAM,

638
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:48,366
PLEASE STOP DIGGING."

639
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:49,442
AND IT IS WORTH TAKING A MOMENT

640
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,466
TO LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THE

641
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:52,166
DEBATE OVER THE NATIONAL DEBT.

642
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:55,233
BECAUSE THE ARGUMENT REPUBLICANS

643
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,442
OFTEN MAKE IS THAT THEY ARE THE

644
00:16:56,466 --> 00:16:57,000
RESPONSIBLE ONES WHO WANT TO

645
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:58,366
REDUCE THE DEBT AND REIN IN

646
00:16:58,433 --> 00:16:59,666
SPENDING, WHEREAS DEMOCRATS

647
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:00,500
DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THE

648
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:01,576
DEBT, AND JUST LOVE RECKLESSLY

649
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,766
THROWING MONEY AROUND.

650
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,966
BUT THAT STORY JUST DOES NOT

651
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:05,800
MATCH UP TO REALITY.

652
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:07,000
TAKE RONALD REAGAN.

653
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:08,500
HE SPENT YEARS COMPLAINING THAT

654
00:17:08,566 --> 00:17:09,709
DEFICITS WERE A SIGN THAT THE

655
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:10,809
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD SIMPLY

656
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,466
LOST ITS WAY.

657
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:13,966
I THINK THE ANSWER TO CURING

658
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,600
INFLATION IS A BALANCED BUDGET.

659
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,166
NOW, HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

660
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:20,000
I MEAN, THAT'S NOT... HOW DO YOU

661
00:17:20,066 --> 00:17:21,733
BALANCE THE BUDGET?

662
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
WELL, BALANCING THE BUDGET IS

663
00:17:23,866 --> 00:17:24,366
LIKE PROTECTING YOUR VIRT...

664
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:25,166
YOU DON'T SPEND MORE THAN YOU

665
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:25,833
TAKE IN.

666
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,633
RIGHT?

667
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,300
YEAH, IT'S LIKE PROTECTING

668
00:17:27,366 --> 00:17:28,366
YOUR VIRTUE.

669
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,400
YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO SAY NO.

670
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,666
REALLY?

671
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:37,033
AN APPLAUSE BREAK?

672
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,633
IS THERE ANYTHING WEIRDER THAN

673
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,742
CALLING SOMEONE'S VIRGINITY

674
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:41,300
THEIR VIRTUE?

675
00:17:41,366 --> 00:17:46,233
BECAUSE AS FAR AS VIRTUES GO,

676
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,466
IT IS A PRETTY SHITTY ONE.

677
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,200
I'M NOT SAYING THERE'S SOMETHING

678
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:48,966
INHERENTLY WRONG WITH NOT HAVING

679
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:49,700
SEX.

680
00:17:49,766 --> 00:17:50,633
THAT'S A PERSONAL CHOICE.

681
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,433
I'VE FREQUENTLY NOT HAD SEX

682
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,200
DUE TO LOTS OF PEOPLE'S

683
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:54,800
PERSONAL CHOICES.

684
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,009
BUT IF THAT IS THE BEST THING

685
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:56,700
ABOUT YOU, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY

686
00:17:56,766 --> 00:17:57,866
GET SOME OTHER VIRTUES.

687
00:17:57,933 --> 00:18:00,233
BUT THE KEY THING TO KNOW IS,

688
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,476
REAGAN DIDN'T, IN FACT, END UP

689
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,266
SPENDING HIS PRESIDENCY SAYING

690
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,700
NO.

691
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:05,266
BECAUSE HE WASN'T REALLY

692
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,833
PROMISING NOT TO SPEND MONEY,

693
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,166
SO MUCH AS PROMISING NOT TO

694
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:10,633
SPEND IT ON CERTAIN PEOPLE.

695
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,233
HIS CAMPAIGN RHETORIC ABOUT

696
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,833
"WELFARE QUEENS" PLAYED INTO THE

697
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,942
RACIST TROPE THAT BLACK PEOPLE

698
00:18:14,966 --> 00:18:16,086
WERE FRAUDULENTLY BENEFITING

699
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:17,233
FROM WASTEFUL GOVERNMENT

700
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,500
SPENDING.

701
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:21,300
AND AS PRESIDENT, HE FOLLOWED

702
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:22,866
THROUGH BY MAKING CUTS TO BASIC

703
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:24,333
ELEMENTS OF THE SOCIAL SAFETY

704
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,866
NET, LIKE FOOD STAMPS, WELFARE,

705
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:29,266
AND MEDICAID.

706
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,933
BUT HE ALSO MASSIVELY INCREASED

707
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,166
DEFENSE SPENDING, WHILE CUTTING

708
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:34,933
TAXES, SO THE GOVERNMENT TOOK IN

709
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,466
LESS MONEY, CREATING LARGE

710
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,200
DEFICITS THAT WOUND UP TRIPLING

711
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:39,400
THE NATIONAL DEBT.

712
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:41,300
WHICH I GUESS, IN HIS TERMS,

713
00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:42,633
MADE REAGAN AMERICA'S HOTTEST

714
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,566
LITTLE SLUT.

715
00:18:44,633 --> 00:18:46,266
THEN CAME THESE TWO GUYS.

716
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:51,800
AND BETWEEN BUSH SENIOR AND

717
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:53,933
CLINTON, THEY MORE OR LESS DID

718
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,900
WHAT REAGAN HAD PROMISED TO DO:

719
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:56,133
CUTTING SPENDING AND RAISING

720
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
TAXES ENOUGH TO ACHIEVE

721
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:58,033
BUDGET SURPLUSES BY THE END

722
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,100
OF THE '90s.

723
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,066
AND THE DEBT WAS BRIEFLY

724
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:01,466
STARTING TO COME DOWN, UNTIL

725
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:03,233
THIS LOVABLE HUMAN RIGHTS

726
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,966
VIOLATION ENTERED THE PICTURE.

727
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:07,400
BECAUSE HE IMMEDIATELY SIGNED

728
00:19:07,466 --> 00:19:09,566
A MASSIVE TAX CUT, LAUNCHED AN

729
00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:10,900
EXPENSIVE WAR ON TERROR, AND

730
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:12,126
THEN SIGNED A SECOND ROUND OF

731
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,233
TAX CUTS.

732
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,566
ALL OF WHICH MADE OUR NATIONAL

733
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:16,500
DEBT EXPLODE, BUT REPUBLICANS,

734
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:17,766
STRANGELY, DIDN'T SEEM TO GIVE

735
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,233
A SHIT.

736
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,533
UNTIL, THAT IS, OBAMA BECAME

737
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,133
PRESIDENT.

738
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,033
HE INHERITED A HISTORIC

739
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,433
RECESSION, AND IMMEDIATELY

740
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,800
SIGNED A LARGE STIMULUS BILL,

741
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,266
BUT AFTERWARDS WAS MET WITH

742
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,666
FERVENT OPPOSITION TO ANY

743
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:32,133
ADDITIONAL SPENDING, MAINLY FROM

744
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,366
REPUBLICANS WHO HAD SUDDENLY

745
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:35,166
RE-FOUND THEIR HATRED FOR

746
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:37,466
"DEFICITS," SOMETIMES EXPRESSING

747
00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:41,533
IT IN TRULY REMARKABLE WAYS.

748
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,166
OUR FREE STUFF TODAY IS BEING

749
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:47,666
PAID FOR BY TAKING MONEY FROM

750
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:49,733
OUR CHILDREN AND BORROWING FROM

751
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,500
CHINA.

752
00:19:53,566 --> 00:19:56,566
WHEN THAT NOTE COMES DUE... AND

753
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:59,800
THIS ISN'T RACIST, SO, YEAH, TRY

754
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:00,500
IT, TRY IT ANYWAY, THIS ISN'T

755
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,000
RACIST... BUT IT'S GONNA BE LIKE

756
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:03,900
SLAVERY WHEN THAT NOTE IS DUE,

757
00:20:03,966 --> 00:20:04,200
RIGHT?

758
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:05,309
WE ARE GONNA BE BEHOLDEN TO A

759
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:09,633
FOREIGN MASTER.

760
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,833
UH, YEAH, NO.

761
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,600
THAT'S JUST NOT HOW ANY OF THAT

762
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:12,433
WORKS.

763
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,542
THE DEBT ISN'T GOING TO JUST

764
00:20:13,566 --> 00:20:14,233
SUDDENLY "COME DUE," ALL AT

765
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,300
ONCE.

766
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:16,866
AND BEING IN DEBT TO SOMEONE

767
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:17,942
ISN'T THE SAME AS BEING ENSLAVED

768
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,100
BY THEM.

769
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,500
IF YOU THINK A PORTION OF US

770
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:21,866
TREASURY BONDS BEING OWNED BY

771
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:24,166
FOREIGN INVESTORS IS ANYTHING

772
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:25,533
LIKE SLAVERY, YOU KNOW BOTH

773
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,066
A VERY SMALL AMOUNT ABOUT

774
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:28,433
THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND A VERY

775
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,166
RACIST AMOUNT ABOUT SLAVERY.

776
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,300
EVEN IF YOU

777
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,266
PREFACE SOMETHING THAT ISN'T

778
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,966
RACIST WITH "THIS ISN'T RACIST,"

779
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:38,366
IT WILL STILL SOUND RACIST.

780
00:20:38,433 --> 00:20:39,566
IF YOU SAID,

781
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:41,066
"A LOT OF PEOPLE BUY JEANS AT

782
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:42,533
OLD NAVY"... TOTALLY FINE.

783
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,466
BUT IF YOU SAID, "A LOT OF

784
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,200
PEOPLE... AND THIS ISN'T RACIST,

785
00:20:45,266 --> 00:20:47,633
YEAH, TRY IT, TRY IT ANYWAY,

786
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,900
THIS ISN'T RACIST... BUT A LOT

787
00:20:48,966 --> 00:20:50,800
OF PEOPLE BUY JEANS AT

788
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:52,666
OLD NAVY," NOW THAT SUDDENLY

789
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:54,033
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING THAT'S

790
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,633
GOING TO REQUIRE ABOUT THREE

791
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,100
PAGES OF YOUR NOTES APP.

792
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,666
AND THE THING IS, REPUBLICANS

793
00:20:57,733 --> 00:20:59,033
PUTTING THE BRAKES ON OBAMA'S

794
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,033
RECOVERY SPENDING IS NOW WIDELY

795
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,109
CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN A BIG

796
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:03,366
MISTAKE.

797
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:04,666
MOST EXPERTS AGREE THAT THE

798
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:06,333
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DIDN'T SPEND

799
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
AS MUCH ON STIMULUS AS IT SHOULD

800
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:10,066
HAVE FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL

801
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:11,833
CRISIS, FORCING STATE AND LOCAL

802
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,076
GOVERNMENTS INTO AUSTERITY THAT

803
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,300
DELAYED THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY BY

804
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:17,333
ABOUT FOUR YEARS.

805
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,766
AND THEN CAME THIS FUCKING GUY.

806
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,500
HE CAMPAIGNED ON ELIMINATING THE

807
00:21:22,566 --> 00:21:24,466
ENTIRE NATIONAL DEBT, ONLY TO

808
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,500
THEN IMPLEMENT AN ABSOLUTELY

809
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:28,333
MASSIVE TAX CUT, RESULTING IN

810
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,033
HUGE DEFICITS.

811
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,633
MOST CORPORATIONS WHO BENEFITED

812
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,600
USED THE MONEY NOT ON

813
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,676
INVESTMENTS IN THINGS LIKE

814
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,466
FACTORIES, BUT ON STOCK

815
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:36,066
BUYBACKS.

816
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:38,433
AS FOR INDIVIDUALS, NEARLY HALF

817
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,800
THE TAX CUTS WENT TO THE TOP

818
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:41,300
FIVE PERCENT OF INCOME EARNERS.

819
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,900
SO WE GAVE MORE MONEY TO PEOPLE

820
00:21:42,966 --> 00:21:45,633
WHO ALREADY HAD IT.

821
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,066
AND DESPITE CLAIMING THAT

822
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:48,333
TRUMP'S TAX CUTS WOULD

823
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,100
"PAY FOR THEMSELVES,"

824
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,966
THEY VERY MUCH DID NOT.

825
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:55,733
IN FACT, THEY DID SO LITTLE TO

826
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,966
BOOST THE ECONOMY, THEY'RE

827
00:21:59,033 --> 00:21:59,966
PROJECTED TO COST US

828
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:00,833
$1.9 TRILLION OVER

829
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,266
A 10-YEAR PERIOD.

830
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,566
ALL OF WHICH CLEARLY LEFT SOME

831
00:22:03,633 --> 00:22:04,100
"FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE"

832
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,000
REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED FOR THOSE

833
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:06,076
TAX CUTS IN A PRETTY AWKWARD

834
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:11,000
POSITION.

835
00:22:11,066 --> 00:22:13,466
UA BELONG TO A PARTY THAT HAS

836
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:14,466
GREEN LIGHT TO HISTORIC

837
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,400
EXPANSION OF DEFICITS AND DEBT.

838
00:22:17,466 --> 00:22:19,133
AND IT'S JUST A PLAIN FACT.

839
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,033
DO I WISH THAT IT WAS A

840
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,433
HIGHER PRIORITY FOR THE

841
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,166
PRESIDENT TO REIN IN SPENDING ON

842
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:27,433
THE DEBT?

843
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:27,833
YES.

844
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,976
DO YOU THINK YOUR COLLEAGUES,

845
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,933
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WILL

846
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,500
REDISCOVER ITS CONCERN ABOUT

847
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:31,133
DEBT AND DEFICITS?

848
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,833
OH, SURE.

849
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,533
SURE.

850
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,666
I MEAN, ISN'T THAT THE MOST

851
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:35,733
CYNICAL, PHONY THING...

852
00:22:35,766 --> 00:22:36,366
OH, LOOK, THERE'S AN ELEMENT

853
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:37,066
OF IT.

854
00:22:37,133 --> 00:22:37,800
DOESN'T THAT MAKE YOU WANNA

855
00:22:37,866 --> 00:22:38,666
PUKE?

856
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:39,333
YOU'RE TOUCHING INTO

857
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,476
SOMETHING THAT, AS YOU KNOW,

858
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,766
I HAVE RAGED AGAINST.

859
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:42,566
I DO NOT LIKE THAT MAN

860
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:43,800
TED CRUZ.

861
00:22:43,866 --> 00:22:45,033
I DO NOT LIKE HIS FAR RIGHT

862
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,966
VIEWS.

863
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:46,933
I DO NOT LIKE HIM IN THESE

864
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:47,533
REEDS.

865
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,500
I DO NOT LIKE HIM WHEN HE FEEDS.

866
00:22:49,566 --> 00:22:51,700
I DO NOT LIKE HIM BY A WALL.

867
00:22:51,766 --> 00:22:53,833
I DO NOT LIKE THIS SHIT AT ALL.

868
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,833
I DO NOT LIKE HIM AS SANTA'S

869
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,800
ELF.

870
00:22:55,866 --> 00:22:56,700
THAT MAN TED CRUZ CAN FUCK

871
00:22:56,766 --> 00:23:01,133
HIMSELF.

872
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,933
THAT IS A PRETTY FLAGRANT

873
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,240
ADMISSION OF A DOUBLE STANDARD.

874
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:05,833
THE ONLY CLEARER EXAMPLE MAY

875
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,942
HAVE BEEN WHEN MICK MULVANEY,

876
00:23:06,966 --> 00:23:08,142
TRUMP'S FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF,

877
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,066
SAID, "THE WORST THING IN THE

878
00:23:09,133 --> 00:23:10,266
WHOLE WORLD IS DEFICITS WHEN

879
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,900
BARACK OBAMA WAS THE PRESIDENT.

880
00:23:11,966 --> 00:23:12,866
THEN DONALD TRUMP BECAME

881
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,076
PRESIDENT, AND WE'RE A LOT LESS

882
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,200
INTERESTED AS A PARTY."

883
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:18,800
AND THAT IS JUST FLAT-OUT

884
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:21,133
ADMITTING THE WHOLE GAME.

885
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,666
BUT EVEN IF YOU PUT ALL OF THAT

886
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:26,000
BAD-FAITH HYPOCRISY ASIDE,

887
00:23:26,066 --> 00:23:27,000
WE ARE STILL LEFT WITH

888
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:27,733
THE KEY QUESTION:

889
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,866
HOW MUCH DEBT IS TOO MUCH?

890
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:30,366
AND THE INTERESTING ANSWER TO

891
00:23:30,433 --> 00:23:33,066
THAT IS, "NOBODY REALLY KNOWS."

892
00:23:33,133 --> 00:23:34,333
FOR MANY YEARS, WE THOUGHT

893
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,509
THE BEST WAY TO MEASURE DEBT

894
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:35,966
WAS TO COMPARE IT TO

895
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:37,900
THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT.

896
00:23:37,966 --> 00:23:39,733
BASICALLY, MEASURING HOW MUCH IN

897
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,300
TOTAL THE COUNTRY OWES, VERSUS

898
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:42,800
HOW MUCH IT PRODUCES EACH YEAR.

899
00:23:42,866 --> 00:23:44,166
AND THE ECONOMIC CONSENSUS WAS

900
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:46,100
THAT DEBT EXCEEDING GDP... OR

901
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:48,666
EVEN GETTING CLOSE TO IT... WAS

902
00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:50,933
A HARD RED LINE THAT COULD NOT

903
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,040
BE CROSSED WITHOUT RISKING

904
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,566
A FINANCIAL CRISIS.

905
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:54,866
IT WAS SOMETHING OCCASIONALLY

906
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,209
EXPRESSED IN FAIRLY OVER-THE-TOP

907
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:57,409
WAYS, LIKE IN THIS JOHN STOSSEL

908
00:23:57,433 --> 00:23:58,800
CLIP FROM 2011.

909
00:23:58,866 --> 00:23:59,933
OUR GOVERNMENT KEEPS

910
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,866
SPENDING.

911
00:24:00,933 --> 00:24:02,200
YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALREADY

912
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:05,500
$14.5 TRILLION IN DEBT.

913
00:24:05,566 --> 00:24:06,500
BUT YOU COULD SAY, "SO WHAT?

914
00:24:06,566 --> 00:24:07,266
LOOK AROUND.

915
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,409
AMERICA'S DOING PRETTY WELL.

916
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:09,476
WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD

917
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,500
HAPPEN?"

918
00:24:12,566 --> 00:24:15,400
WELL, THIS COULD HAPPEN.

919
00:24:15,466 --> 00:24:16,742
THESE VIOLENT PROTESTS BROKE OUT

920
00:24:16,766 --> 00:24:18,333
ONCE GREECE WAS SO DEEP IN DEBT

921
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,333
THAT GREECE HAD TROUBLE

922
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,300
BORROWING MORE MONEY.

923
00:24:22,366 --> 00:24:23,433
GREECE SPENT SO MUCH THAT

924
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,333
BY LAST YEAR, THEY OWED MORE

925
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,233
MONEY THAN THEIR ENTIRE ECONOMY

926
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,733
PRODUCED.

927
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,933
NO WONDER THEY'RE IN TROUBLE.

928
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,266
WE WON'T REACH THAT LEVEL OF

929
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,600
DEBT UNTIL, WELL, OOPS.

930
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:35,100
PRETTY SOON.

931
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,266
WE'RE ON A CLEAR TRACK TO A

932
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,833
GREEK-TYPE CRISIS.

933
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,033
OH, COME ON, STOSSEL!

934
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,366
CUTTING TO FOOTAGE OF A RIOT

935
00:24:41,433 --> 00:24:43,233
CAN MAKE ANYTHING SEEM MORE DIRE

936
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,600
THAN MIGHT ACTUALLY BE THE CASE.

937
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:47,633
REGE-JEAN PAGE IS

938
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,266
APPARENTLY NOT APPEARING ON THE

939
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:49,442
SECOND SEASON OF "BRIDGERTON."

940
00:24:49,466 --> 00:24:50,266
SO WHAT?

941
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:51,376
WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD

942
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,233
HAPPEN?

943
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,066
WELL, THIS COULD HAPPEN.

944
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:59,666
OH SHIT!

945
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:00,533
FEELS PRETTY SCARY, DOESN'T IT?

946
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,700
BUT THE TRUTH IS MUCH MORE

947
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:02,466
COMPLEX.

948
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:03,366
BECAUSE, A, HIS CHARACTER ARC

949
00:25:03,433 --> 00:25:04,100
IS MOSTLY WRAPPED UP AND

950
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:04,833
THE DUKE DOESN'T APPEAR IN

951
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,566
THE REST OF THE NOVELS.

952
00:25:05,633 --> 00:25:06,809
IT'S REALLY A GENERATIONAL STORY

953
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:08,766
OF A WHOLE FAMILY!

954
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:09,366
ALSO, YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY

955
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:10,466
LOSE THE DUKE!

956
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:11,933
IT'S ACTUALLY PERFECTLY

957
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,766
IN HIS CHARACTER TO START

958
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:15,333
SOMETHING HE DOESN'T FINISH.

959
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,233
BUT IT'S MORE COMPLEX WHEN IT

960
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,700
COMES TO OUR ECONOMY, TOO.

961
00:25:19,766 --> 00:25:20,633
BECAUSE SOMETHING FASCINATING

962
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,200
HAPPENED AROUND LAST JUNE:

963
00:25:22,266 --> 00:25:23,200
LARGELY BECAUSE OF INCREASED

964
00:25:23,266 --> 00:25:24,376
BORROWING RESULTING FROM THE

965
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,166
FIRST ROUND OF COVID STIMULUS,

966
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,900
OUR NATIONAL DEBT ACTUALLY

967
00:25:27,966 --> 00:25:31,033
SURPASSED THE SIZE OF OUR GDP.

968
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,000
YOU KNOW, KIND OF LIKE GREECE.

969
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:34,466
BUT ALL THOSE DISASTER SCENARIOS

970
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,533
THAT JOHN STOSSEL'S

971
00:25:35,566 --> 00:25:37,133
PERFORMATIVELY EXAGGERATED VOICE

972
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,533
FLUCTUATIONS WARNED US ABOUT?

973
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,666
NONE OF THEM HAPPENED.

974
00:25:40,733 --> 00:25:42,533
IT DIDN'T SUDDENLY COST US A LOT

975
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,700
MORE TO BORROW MONEY DUE TO

976
00:25:43,766 --> 00:25:44,466
HIGHER INTEREST RATES.

977
00:25:44,533 --> 00:25:45,573
WE DIDN'T, AS YOU MAY HAVE

978
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,266
NOTICED, BECOME GREECE.

979
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:50,000
IN FACT, DESPITE ADDING

980
00:25:50,066 --> 00:25:52,300
$4 TRILLION TO THE DEBT LAST

981
00:25:52,366 --> 00:25:54,166
YEAR, INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THAT

982
00:25:54,233 --> 00:25:55,700
DEBT ACTUALLY DECLINED.

983
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:57,100
AND THAT ISN'T EVEN A ONE-OFF:

984
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:58,933
AS OUR DEBT HAS RISEN IN RECENT

985
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,233
YEARS, INTEREST RATES HAVE

986
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,600
FALLEN TO HISTORIC LOWS.

987
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:04,633
SO WHAT IS THE REASON FOR THAT?

988
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,633
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

989
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,000
I'M NOT AN ECONOMIST, NOR DO I

990
00:26:09,066 --> 00:26:11,000
DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT MATH.

991
00:26:11,066 --> 00:26:11,800
WHICH I KNOW MAY BE SURPRISING,

992
00:26:11,866 --> 00:26:13,233
GIVEN THAT I HAVE THE FACE OF

993
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,600
SOMEONE WHO HAS A FAVORITE KIND

994
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:16,700
OF GRAPHING CALCULATOR.

995
00:26:16,766 --> 00:26:18,266
WHAT IS SHOCKING IS THAT EVEN

996
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:19,933
EXPERT ECONOMISTS CAN'T REALLY

997
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,466
EXPLAIN IT EITHER.

998
00:26:21,533 --> 00:26:22,900
HERE'S THE FORMER CHIEF OF THE

999
00:26:22,966 --> 00:26:26,166
IMF BASICALLY ADMITTING AS MUCH.

1000
00:26:26,233 --> 00:26:27,800
TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK, WE DO

1001
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:29,400
NOT... AT LEAST I DO NOT,

1002
00:26:29,466 --> 00:26:30,633
I DON'T WANT TO TALK FOR THE

1003
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,666
PROFESSION... WE'VE HAD THIS

1004
00:26:32,733 --> 00:26:34,133
STEADY DECREASE IN THE INTEREST

1005
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,566
RATE SINCE THE MID '80s,

1006
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:37,966
CONTINUING A BIT MORE

1007
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:39,400
IN THE CRISIS, BUT, YOU KNOW,

1008
00:26:39,466 --> 00:26:40,966
CONTINUING NOW.

1009
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:44,033
AND WE HAVE NO EXPLANATION.

1010
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,933
YEAH, THEY DON'T KNOW!

1011
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,333
NOW, HE WENT ON TO POINT OUT

1012
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,200
THAT THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF

1013
00:26:48,266 --> 00:26:49,300
POSSIBILITIES.

1014
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:50,700
IT MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH

1015
00:26:50,766 --> 00:26:51,776
AGING POPULATIONS IN ADVANCED

1016
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,066
ECONOMIES, CHINA'S HIGH SAVINGS

1017
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:54,500
RATE, THE GENERAL LACK OF

1018
00:26:54,566 --> 00:26:55,642
CAPITAL-INTENSIVE INVESTMENT

1019
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:56,833
OPPORTUNITIES, OR MERELY THE

1020
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,833
FACT THAT RICHARD CAMPBELL OF

1021
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,633
OMAHA, NEBRASKA, HASN'T STEPPED

1022
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,233
ON A CRACK IN THE SIDEWALK IN

1023
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,600
OVER 30 YEARS.

1024
00:27:01,666 --> 00:27:03,066
BUT THE POINT IS, ECONOMISTS

1025
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:05,833
REALLY HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.

1026
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,300
IN FACT, THE CONGRESSIONAL

1027
00:27:07,366 --> 00:27:09,266
BUDGET OFFICE HAS NOW SAID THAT

1028
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:12,366
THE DEBT-TO-GDP RATIO HAS NO SET

1029
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:16,066
TIPPING POINT WHERE A FINANCIAL

1030
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:16,500
CRISIS IS IMMINENT.

1031
00:27:16,566 --> 00:27:18,533
SO TAKEN TOGETHER, ALL OF THIS

1032
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,966
HAS MADE MANY ECONOMISTS START

1033
00:27:20,033 --> 00:27:20,533
CHANGING THE WAY THEY THINK

1034
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,200
ABOUT DEBT.

1035
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,233
THINKING THAT VERY BASICALLY,

1036
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,376
SO LONG AS OUR ECONOMY GROWS

1037
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,900
AT A RATE GREATER THAN THE

1038
00:27:26,966 --> 00:27:28,042
INTEREST WE'RE PAYING ON OUR

1039
00:27:28,066 --> 00:27:30,433
DEBT, WE CAN COME OUT AHEAD.

1040
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,576
IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU'D COME

1041
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,533
OUT AHEAD IF YOU BORROWED MONEY

1042
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,066
AT 2% INTEREST AND THEN INVESTED

1043
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:37,933
IT SOMEWHERE AND GOT 5% RETURNS.

1044
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,466
BUT THE LARGER POINT IS, THIS

1045
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,100
WHOLE FIELD IS IN A BIT OF FLUX

1046
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:43,266
RIGHT NOW.

1047
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:45,566
SOME ECONOMISTS BELIEVE THAT WE

1048
00:27:45,633 --> 00:27:46,742
SHOULDN'T GET COMPLACENT... THAT

1049
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:48,033
A DEBT CRISIS IS STILL ON THE

1050
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,766
HORIZON, JUST NOT AT THE TIPPING

1051
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:51,933
POINT WE'D PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT.

1052
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,166
ANOTHER, MORE RADICAL ARGUMENT,

1053
00:27:55,233 --> 00:27:56,900
IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN IN

1054
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,433
FACT CREATE ALL THE MONEY IT

1055
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,633
NEEDS TO PAY FOR STUFF,

1056
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,333
AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T GENERATE

1057
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
INFLATION.

1058
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:03,166
THE POINT IS, THERE IS A

1059
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:04,513
GOOD-FAITH DEBATE TO BE HAD OVER

1060
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:06,133
HOW TO HANDLE OUR NATIONAL DEBT

1061
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,366
OVER THE LONG TERM.

1062
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:09,933
BUT RIGHT NOW, MOST ECONOMISTS

1063
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,633
ACTUALLY AGREE THAT, WITH

1064
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,666
INTEREST RATES AT HISTORIC LOWS,

1065
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,033
THE QUESTION SHOULDN'T REALLY

1066
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:15,933
BE, "HOW MUCH DEBT ARE WE TAKING

1067
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,200
ON?"

1068
00:28:17,266 --> 00:28:19,200
AS MUCH AS, "WHAT IS THE VALUE

1069
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:19,866
OF WHAT WE'RE GETTING FOR IT IN

1070
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:21,600
RETURN?"

1071
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:22,833
AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY DUMB

1072
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,633
FISCAL DECISIONS WE COULD MAKE,

1073
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,566
LIKE TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH.

1074
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:29,066
WE'VE TRIED THAT MULTIPLE TIMES,

1075
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:30,766
AND IF THEY WERE THE MAGIC KEY

1076
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:32,166
TO ELIMINATING OUR DEBT

1077
00:28:32,233 --> 00:28:33,342
LONG-TERM, WE PROBABLY WOULD

1078
00:28:33,366 --> 00:28:34,509
HAVE SEEN SIGNS OF IT WORKING

1079
00:28:34,533 --> 00:28:35,866
BY NOW.

1080
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:37,600
BUT THERE ARE SMART FINANCIAL

1081
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:39,966
DECISIONS, THAT MORE THAN

1082
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:41,466
JUSTIFY GOING INTO DEBT, LIKE

1083
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:43,666
SPENDING ON SOCIAL PROGRAMS,

1084
00:28:43,733 --> 00:28:44,533
INFRASTRUCTURE, OR,

1085
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,400
ON AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL,

1086
00:28:46,466 --> 00:28:49,033
THIS NICOLAS CAGE PILLOW.

1087
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,366
IT'S THE SECOND BEST INVESTMENT

1088
00:28:50,433 --> 00:28:50,900
I'VE EVER MADE, AFTER, OF

1089
00:28:50,966 --> 00:28:51,900
COURSE, BUYING ANOTHER

1090
00:28:51,966 --> 00:28:53,666
NICOLAS CAGE PILLOW.

1091
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:55,166
I WAS WORRIED MY WIFE WOULD GET

1092
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,166
JEALOUS, SO THIS ONE IS TO

1093
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:58,400
REPLACE MY WIFE.

1094
00:28:58,466 --> 00:29:01,700
AND AMIDST THE CURRENT CRISIS,

1095
00:29:01,766 --> 00:29:03,866
MANY EXPERTS ARE LESS CONCERNED

1096
00:29:03,933 --> 00:29:05,200
ABOUT US SPENDING TOO MUCH

1097
00:29:05,266 --> 00:29:07,433
THAN SPENDING TOO LITTLE.

1098
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,433
AND IF IT TURNS OUT THAT

1099
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,200
INFLATION OR INTEREST RATES

1100
00:29:10,266 --> 00:29:11,766
DO START TO RISE, WE SHOULD

1101
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,166
ABSOLUTELY START CUTTING

1102
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:15,800
DEFICITS, ALTHOUGH NOT BY

1103
00:29:15,866 --> 00:29:16,909
CUTTING GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS

1104
00:29:16,933 --> 00:29:18,142
PEOPLE NEED, BUT THROUGH TAXING

1105
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:20,733
PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD IT.

1106
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,266
LOOK, NO ONE CREDIBLE IS SAYING

1107
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:25,533
DEFICITS DON'T MATTER, OR THAT

1108
00:29:25,566 --> 00:29:26,742
WE SHOULD BORROW AS IF THE SKY'S

1109
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:27,600
THE LIMIT.

1110
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:28,666
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS,

1111
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,000
THE DEBATE SHOULDN'T BE ABOUT

1112
00:29:30,066 --> 00:29:31,666
WHETHER DEBT IS GOOD OR BAD.

1113
00:29:31,733 --> 00:29:33,500
IT SHOULD BE ABOUT WHETHER

1114
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:34,866
THE INVESTMENTS WE'RE MAKING

1115
00:29:34,933 --> 00:29:36,600

ABOUT THE NATIONAL DEBT.

1133
00:30:05,866 --> 00:30:08,433
YOU IDIOTS HAVE NO IDEA WHAT

1134
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,066
IT WORKS.

1135
00:30:09,133 --> 00:30:11,166
TAKE THE STUPID DEBT CLOCK.

1136
00:30:11,233 --> 00:30:13,366
DO EVEN KNOW WHAT A CLOCK

1137
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:13,533
IS?

1138
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,366
CLOCK, NOT A CLOCK.

1139
00:30:15,433 --> 00:30:18,033
ALSO, THAT ISN'T ALWAYS A BAD

1140
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:18,233
THING.

1141
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,200
YES, GOING INTO DEBT TO GIVE

1142
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:21,900
MONEY BACK TO PEOPLE ALREADY

1143
00:30:21,966 --> 00:30:23,066
HAVE TOO MUCH IS STUPID.

1144
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:25,366
LOOK AT THIS GUY.

1145
00:30:25,433 --> 00:30:26,466
SLICK FLAME THROWER, BRO.

1146
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,833
YOU CAN USE THAT TO BUILD NEW

1147
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,166
BRIROADS ROADS AND BRIDGES.

1148
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:33,600
YOU CAN USE IT TO IMPROVE

1149
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,200
SCHOOLS, WHICH WOULD MAKE US

1150
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:36,066
INTO A BETTER LABOR FORCE.

1151
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:38,466
YOU CAN USE OR TO IMPROVE

1152
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:38,766
HEALTH CARE.

1153
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:40,066
YOU CAN EVEN USE IT TO BUY

1154
00:30:40,133 --> 00:30:43,300
THESE PILLOWS, WHICH WILL BECOME

1155
00:30:43,366 --> 00:30:44,500
TREASURED FAMILY HEIRLOOMS.

1156
00:30:44,566 --> 00:30:45,742
THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT DEBT

1157
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:46,966
IS WHAT YOU GET OUT OF IT.

1158
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:48,900
AND WHAT WE GET OUT OF IT.

1159
00:30:48,966 --> 00:30:50,600
YOU SEE, DEBT CAN BE A TOOL FOR

1160
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:50,966
GROWTH.

1161
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:53,766
IN FACT, THE DEBT TO GDP RATIO

1162
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:55,500
IS NOT AS RELIABLE A METRIC AS

1163
00:30:55,566 --> 00:30:56,066
ASSUMED.

1164
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:58,300
THEY TURNED OUT TO BE LARGELY

1165
00:30:58,366 --> 00:30:59,933
FLAWED, GIVEN THE CONTINUING

1166
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,500
INVERSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

1167
00:31:00,566 --> 00:31:01,233
RISING DEBT AND LOW INTEREST

1168
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:01,433
RATES.

1169
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,500
SO IT FOLLOWS, THE ECONOMY'S

1170
00:31:04,566 --> 00:31:07,733
CAPACITY TO IMPROVE DEBT WITHOUT

1171
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,633
FOLLOWING MASSIVE INCREASES.

1172
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,400
IT IS SO SIMPLE.

1173
00:31:11,466 --> 00:31:12,700
THE EASIEST THING IN THE

1174
00:31:12,766 --> 00:31:12,966
WORLD.

1175
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:15,400
I AM NINE YEARS OLD AT EVEN I

1176
00:31:15,466 --> 00:31:15,766
UNDERSTAND THAT.

1177
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:17,466
AND IF YOU ARE SO CONCERNED

1178
00:31:17,533 --> 00:31:18,900
ABOUT OUR FUTURE, MAYBE IT IS

1179
00:31:18,966 --> 00:31:20,042
WORTH SPENDING NOW ON THINGS

1180
00:31:20,066 --> 00:31:22,000
LIKE PREPARING FOR THE IMPACTS

1181
00:31:22,066 --> 00:31:22,700
OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

1182
00:31:22,766 --> 00:31:24,333
THE CLOCK IS REALLY TAKING ON

1183
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:24,600
THAT ONE.

1184
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:26,800
IT'S NOT A CLOCK.

1185
00:31:26,866 --> 00:31:28,833
PLEASE.

1186
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,100
PLEASE.

1187
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:30,533
BELIEVE US WHEN WE SAY, WE

1188
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,966
ARE NOT AS SCARED OF BEING BORN

1189
00:31:33,033 --> 00:31:34,533
INTO DEBT AS WE ARE OF BEING

1190
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,266
BORN INTO A COUNTRY THAT DIDN'T

1191
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:36,766
INVEST INTO OUR FUTURE.

1192
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:38,466
AND WE ARE ALSO SCARED OF

1193
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:39,366
THAT GUY DIGGING THE HOLE THE

1194
00:31:39,433 --> 00:31:39,566
HOLE.

1195
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:41,233
I THINK THAT GOES WITHOUT

1196
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:41,500
SAYING.

1197
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:45,000
SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE

1198
00:31:45,066 --> 00:31:45,233
DEBT...

1199
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,733
YOUR CHILDREN, GRANDCHILDREN,

1200
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,600
AND GREAT GRANDCHILDREN, ALL

1201
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:52,033
HAVE ONE MESSAGE FOR YOU.

1202
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,466
GROW THE FUCK UP.

1203
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:54,866
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

1204
00:31:54,933 --> 00:31:56,300
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

1205
00:31:56,366 --> 00:31:57,966
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

1206
00:31:58,033 --> 00:31:59,033
GOOD NIGHT.
