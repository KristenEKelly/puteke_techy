1
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:33,976
HI THERE, WELCOME TO

2
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:35,535
THE SHOW, WE'RE BACK, STILL FROM

3
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,658
THIS BLANK VOID.

4
00:00:37,683 --> 00:00:39,433
ON THAT POINT, I HAVE A BIT OF
AN UPDATE.

5
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:40,966
LOOKS LIKE, ALL BEING WELL, WE

6
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:42,433
ARE SET TO BE BACK IN OUR STUDIO

7
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,233
IN SEPTEMBER, MEANING THAT THE

8
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,566
NEXT FIVE SHOWS ARE ACTUALLY

9
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:46,500
GOING TO BE THE LAST THAT WE DO

10
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:49,266
THERE IN THE VOID.

11
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,683
HOLY SHIT, THANK GOD.

12
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:53,541
EXCUSE ME?

13
00:00:53,566 --> 00:00:55,333
YOU HEARD ME.

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,666
I'M SORRY, YOU CAN TALK?

15
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:58,328
OF COURSE I CAN TALK, JOHN.

16
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,800
I CAN ALSO CRY, WHICH, YOU KNOW,

17
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:03,584
I'M NOT AFRAID TO CRY.

18
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:04,433
I CAN SING PRETTY WELL,

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,066
ACTUALLY.

20
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:05,633
NICE.

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,566
ALSO, I CAN LAUGH.

22
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:07,266
VOID LOVES TO LAUGH.

23
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,200
I'M SORRY, YOU CAN

24
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:09,266
LAUGH?

25
00:01:10,984 --> 00:01:12,350
REALLY?

26
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:12,908
I'VE BEEN STUCK HERE

27
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:13,766
FOR NEARLY A YEAR AND A HALF

28
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:14,333
TELLING JOKES AND I HAVEN'T

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,033
HEARD YOU LAUGH ONCE.

30
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,866
NOT ONE TIME.

31
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:17,866
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE YOU

32
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:18,942
HAVEN'T REALLY GIVEN ME A REASON

33
00:01:18,966 --> 00:01:21,066
TO, AND I DIDN'T CONSIDER ANY OF

34
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:21,933
THOSE JOKES.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
THAT IS A MEAN THING TO

36
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:24,000
SAY.

37
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:24,800
I'M GOING TO GET THIS OFF MY

38
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:26,166
CHEST.

39
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:28,466
I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE.

40
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:29,400
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

41
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:30,333
WHAT?

42
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,766
IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY GOOD

43
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:34,700
TO BE JUST A VOID AGAIN WITHOUT

44
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:36,366
YOU IN IT, WHICH IS A PRETTY

45
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:37,300
SHOCKING DECLARATION WHEN YOU

46
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:38,376
SAY THAT A VOID WOULD RATHER BE

47
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,766
JUST A VOID WITH NOTHING IN IT

48
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:43,633
BECAUSE OF YOU.

49
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,966
LOOK, CAN I JUST START

50
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:45,600
MY SHOW NOW PLEASE?

51
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:46,166
GO AHEAD, I MEAN, IF YOU

52
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:47,100
WANT.

53
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,333
OR DON'T.

54
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,200
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER TO ME

55
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:52,266
EITHER WAY.

56
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:52,833
HAS IT BEEN A BUSY WEEK, JOHN?

57
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,700
YES, IT HAS.

58
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:54,833
IT HAS, ACTUALLY.

59
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,433
SO AGGRAVATING.

60
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,500
ALL RIGHT.

61
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:01,233
JUST PRETEND I'M NOT HERE.

62
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,466
I WILL.

63
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:07,866
I WILL REMAIN SILENT.

64
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:08,942
BECAUSE I WON'T BE LAUGHING.

65
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:11,133
THAT IS UNDERSTOOD.

66
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,266
IT HAS BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

67
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:12,833
VERY BUSY.

68
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,566
I'M READY, THE OLYMPICS OPENING

69
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,566
CEREMONY FINALLY TOOK PLACE IN

70
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:15,500
TOKYO.

71
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:17,000
A YEAR LATE AND STILL UNDER

72
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:17,400
SIGNIFICANT CLOUD.

73
00:02:17,466 --> 00:02:18,000
THIS MORNING, OFFICIALS IN

74
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:18,766
TOKYO REVEALING THAT COVID CASES

75
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,009
HAVE INCREASED 155% IN THE PAST

76
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:21,900
SEVEN DAYS.

77
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:23,500
TONIGHT, COVID-19 DEFEATING

78
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:24,700
SOME OLYMPIC ATHLETES BEFORE

79
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:26,000
THEY'VE EVEN HAD A CHANCE TO

80
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:27,500
COMPETE.

81
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:28,776
ACCORDING TO THE IOC, MORE THAN

82
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,942
60 PEOPLE IN THE OLYMPIC BUBBLE

83
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:31,133
HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR THE

84
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,533
VIRUS.

85
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,900
AND THE TRUTH IS, IT'S

86
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:36,966
GOTTEN EVEN WORSE, BECAUSE AS OF

87
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:38,633
SATURDAY THE CURRENT TOTAL OF

88
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,966
OLYMPICS-RELATED COVID CASES IS

89
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:43,366
UP TO 127.

90
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:44,500
WHICH REALLY SHOULDN'T BE

91
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:45,366
SURPRISING.

92
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:46,509
THE EVENT WHOSE CENTRAL PREMISE

93
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,733
IS BASICALLY, "WHAT IF A BUNCH

94
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,233
OF HOT PEOPLE TRAVELED FROM ALL

95
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:49,966
OVER THE WORLD TO SWEAT,

96
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:50,700
BREATHE, AND FUCK ON EACH OTHER"

97
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:52,046
TURNS OUT TO BE GOING EXACTLY AS

98
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:52,833
YOU'D EXPECT IT TO DURING A

99
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,100
PANDEMIC.

100
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,366
AND I WILL SAY, TOKYO IS BY NO

101
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:58,100
MEANS ALONE IN MAKING A VERY

102
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,433
BOLD MOVE IN THE FACE OF THE

103
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,066
SPREAD OF THE DELTA VARIANT.

104
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:03,333
IN THE U.K., MONDAY MARKED

105
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,266
SO-CALLED FREEDOM DAY, WITH THE

106
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,733
LIFTING OF ALMOST ALL

107
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,366
VIRUS-RELATED RESTRICTIONS, EVEN

108
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:08,642
THOUGH COVID CASES HAVE RECENTLY

109
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:09,966
SPIKED TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS

110
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:12,066
THERE SINCE JANUARY.

111
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:13,800
BORIS JOHNSON HAS FACED

112
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:15,266
SIGNIFICANT CRITICISM ABOUT THIS

113
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,466
DECISION AND HAS CHOSEN TO

114
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:18,500
JUSTIFY IT LIKE THIS:

115
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:19,642
IF WE DON'T DO IT NOW, WE'VE

116
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,600
GOT TO ASK OURSELVES, WHEN WILL

117
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,466
WE EVER DO IT?

118
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:23,633
OH, I CAN ANSWER THAT

119
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,766
LATER.

120
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,933
JUST, A LATER TIME.

121
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,242
IT'S SO BRAZENLY DISINGENUOUS TO

122
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:30,100
FRAME THIS AS A CHOICE BETWEEN

123
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,733
LIFTING COVID RESTRICTIONS NOW

124
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,033
OR NEVER DOING IT.

125
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,566
IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF SOMEONE

126
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:36,500
SAYING, "IF I DON'T TAKE A SHIT

127
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:37,266
NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS APPLE

128
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,342
STORE, WHEN WILL I EVER TAKE A

129
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:39,466
SHIT?"

130
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:41,933
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY, BUT I FEEL

131
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,533
LIKE THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER

132
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,742
OPTIONS AVAILABLE THAT YOU'RE

133
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:45,200
CHOOSING NOT TO CONSIDER.

134
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:48,633
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING, "WHY

135
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,000
DOES BORIS JOHNSON LOOK LIKE

136
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:51,400
HE'S HIRED AN IMPERSONATOR OF

137
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:52,833
HIMSELF TO DELIVER THIS MESSAGE

138
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,533
VIA CAMEO?"

139
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,233
WELL, IT'S BECAUSE HE WAS

140
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,033
SELF-ISOLATING AFTER BEING

141
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,633
EXPOSED TO SOMEONE WHO CAUGHT

142
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,833
COVID.

143
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,766
SPECIFICALLY, HIS HEALTH

144
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,133
MINISTER.

145
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,366
WHICH IS NOT AN IDEAL WAY TO

146
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:02,000
REASSURE PEOPLE THAT "NOW IS THE

147
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:03,466
RIGHT TIME TO OPEN UP."

148
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:04,966
AND EVEN SOME OF THE BRITISH

149
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:07,266
PEOPLE CELEBRATING "FREEDOM DAY"

150
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,233
SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND THEY WERE

151
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,800
DANCING ON A KNIFE'S EDGE.

152
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:10,733
I WANT TO DANCE, I WANT TO

153
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,066
HEAR LIVE MUSIC.

154
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:13,400
YES!

155
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:14,476
IT FEELS LIKE FREEDOM DAY, IT

156
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,900
REALLY, REALLY DOES.

157
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:17,246
IT'S NICE TO BE OUT, BUT LIKE

158
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,200
AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S ALL

159
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:21,300
GOING TO RESULT IN SOME SORT OF

160
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:22,966
IMPENDING DOOM.

161
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:26,900
YOU KNOW WHAT?

162
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:27,633
I HAVE TO AGREE WITH CVS-BRAND

163
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,333
NOEL GALLAGHER THERE.

164
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,166
BECAUSE THAT SENTIMENT

165
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:29,866
FUNDAMENTALLY SPEAKS TO THE

166
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:30,933
BRITISH CHARACTER.

167
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:32,366
SCREW "KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON."

168
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:33,833
"IT'S ALL GOING TO RESULT IN

169
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,133
SOME SORT OF IMPENDING DOOM"

170
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,433
SHOULD BE BRITAIN'S NEW

171
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,733
MOTIVATIONAL POSTER, BECAUSE

172
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,466
THAT IS EXACTLY HOW I FEEL ABOUT

173
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:48,533
EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME.

174
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:50,500
EVEN HERE IN THE UNITED STATES,

175
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:51,233
THERE IS CAUSE FOR REAL CONCERN

176
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:51,766
AMID ALL THE OPTIMISM.

177
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,400
THE DELTA VARIANT NOW ACCOUNTS

178
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:53,509
FOR 83% OF KNOWN U.S. CASES AND

179
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:54,066
IS CAUSING A RISE IN HOSPITAL

180
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:54,666
ADMISSIONS, PARTICULARLY AMONG

181
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:55,166
THE UNVACCINATED.

182
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:56,566
AND YET DESPITE THE FACT THAT

183
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:58,100
VACCINES ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE

184
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,600
HERE, SOME... EVEN THOSE

185
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,400
HOSPITALIZED... ARE STILL

186
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,600
HESITANT.

187
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:03,933
HERE I AM, RECOVERING,

188
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,866
GETTING OUT OF HERE FINALLY

189
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:06,500
TOMORROW.

190
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:07,686
AM I GOING TO GET A VACCINE?

191
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:10,266
NO.

192
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,333
DON'T SHOVE IT DOWN MY THROAT.

193
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,800
THAT'S WHAT'S LOCAL, STATE,

194
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:17,466
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING

195
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:18,266
TO DO, IS SHOVE IT DOWN YOUR

196
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,133
THROAT.

197
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,100
WHAT ARE THEY SHOVING, THE

198
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,266
SCIENCE?

199
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,100
NO, THEY'RE SHOVING THE FACT

200
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,100
THAT THAT'S THEIR AGENDA.

201
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,800
THE AGENDA IS TO GET YOU

202
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:26,100
VACCINATED.

203
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,166
UH...

204
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,233
YEAH.

205
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:32,900
YEAH, ACTURALY, NAILED IT IN

206
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:33,466
ONE.

207
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:34,166
PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS' AGENDA

208
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,233
IS TO GET YOU VACCINATED.

209
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:35,900
AND YOU KNOW WHAT COVID'S AGENDA

210
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:37,533
IS?

211
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,100
TO FUCKING KILL YOU.

212
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:38,900
TO BURROW INTO YOUR BODY THROUGH

213
00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:39,533
YOUR HOT LITTLE MOUTH, FUCK

214
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,233
AROUND WITH YOUR LUNGS, FLIP

215
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,666
YOUR NOSTRILS OFF, MAKE SOUP

216
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:42,909
TASTE MORE LIKE NOTHING THAN IT

217
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:46,900
ALREADY DOES, AND THEN KILL YOU.

218
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:48,666
SO FRANKLY, IF THE CHOICE IS

219
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:56,733
DEATH OR

220
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,366
SHOT THAT COMES WITH

221
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:02,800
FREE KRISPY KREME DONUT, I THINK

222
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:03,366
YOU SHOULD TAKE THE

223
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:04,033
JIZZ-COVERED DOUGH HOOP

224
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,000
WITH A SIDE OF ANTIBODIES.

225
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:06,066
AND WHILE THAT'S CLEARLY

226
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,633
INFURIATING, INDIVIDUALS LIKE

227
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,233
THAT MAN ARE PRETTY MUCH

228
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:07,933
UNREACHABLE AT THIS POINT, WHICH

229
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,733
IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO

230
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,666
CONVINCE EVERYONE WHO MIGHT BE

231
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:11,600
PERSUADABLE TO GET VACCINATED.

232
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:12,466
BECAUSE IF THIS WEEK'S TAUGHT US

233
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:13,833
ANYTHING, IT'S THAT COVID IS

234
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,566
NOWHERE NEAR BEING ERADICATED

235
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:17,800
AND THE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST IT

236
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:19,700
IS BEING FUCKING VACCINATED.

237
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:20,846
YES, THERE ARE BREAKTHROUGH

238
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,766
CASES, BUT THE VACCINE IS DOING

239
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,900
ITS JOB.

240
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,300
MORE THAN 97% OF THOSE

241
00:06:25,366 --> 00:06:26,633
HOSPITALIZED FOR COVID IN THE

242
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,500
U.S. ARE UNVACCINATED.

243
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:31,033
SO RIGHT HERE WE NEED TO BE

244
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,800
ENCOURAGING AS MANY AS POSSIBLE

245
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:36,200
TO GET THEIR SHOTS, AND,

246
00:06:36,266 --> 00:06:37,800
CRUCIALLY, TO THEN SHARE OUR

247
00:06:37,866 --> 00:06:39,200
SURPLUS SUPPLY WITH COUNTRIES

248
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,666
AROUND THE WORLD THAT

249
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,733
DESPERATELY NEED THEM.

250
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,366
BECAUSE... IF I MAY QUOTE THE

251
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:43,666
WORDS OF GEOFFREY RUSH AFTER A

252
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:44,966
BAD BLEACH JOB... "IF WE DON'T

253
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:46,333
DO IT NOW, WHEN WILL WE EVER DO

254
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,233
IT?"

255
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,666
AND NOW THIS.

256
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:54,733
AND NOW, PEOPLE ON

257
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,133
TV MEAN "FUCKING,"

258
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,700
OLYMPICS EDITION.

259
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:01,400
THE OLYMPIC VILLAGE WAS

260
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:02,666
FULL OF CARDBOARD BEDS, AND

261
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:03,433
THE IDEA BEHIND IT, SUPPOSEDLY,

262
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,166
WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE

263
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:05,033
ATHLETES WEREN'T GOING DOWN

264
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,533
THERE DOING THE DO.

265
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,809
IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

266
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:10,700
THE OLYMPIC VILLAGE, YOU KNOW

267
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,366
IT'S A HOTBED FOR...

268
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,033
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

269
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,233
ATHLETES WILL BE PURSUING

270
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,533
THEIR DREAMS, AND PERHAPS EACH

271
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:28,600
OTHER, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

272
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:29,766
SOME EVEN SPECULATING

273
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,066
THEY WERE MEANT TO PREVENT

274
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:31,566
CERTAIN EXTRACURRICULAR

275
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:34,766
ACTIVITIES, YOU WOULD SAY.

276
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:35,700
DOES IT HAVE A BOX SPRING?

277
00:07:35,766 --> 00:07:36,533
NO, EXACTLY, THEY'RE GOING TO

278
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,333
BE WALKING AROUND WITH SORE

279
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,233
BACKS?

280
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,200
I WOULD IMAGINE.

281
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:41,466
TOO BUSY LOOKING AT THE

282
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:42,633
GYMNAST JUMPING UP AND DOWN

283
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,700
WITHOUT A SHIRT ON.

284
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:46,000
I SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

285
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:46,900
YOU SAID YOUR HUSBAND IS OUT

286
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,066
OF TOWN THIS WEEK.

287
00:07:50,033 --> 00:07:50,433
THIS IS HOW RUMORS GET

288
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,366
STARTED.

289
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
MOVING ON.

290
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:01,142
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

291
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,333
LAND.

292
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,476
SPECIFICALLY, THE HISTORY OF

293
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,600
RACE AND LAND OWNERSHIP IN

294
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:09,400
AMERICA.

295
00:08:09,466 --> 00:08:12,033
A HISTORY THAT HAS MANY

296
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,400
HORRIFYING CHAPTERS... PRETTY

297
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:16,100
MUCH FROM CHAPTER ONE, WHEN

298
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,466
AMERICA WAS "DISCOVERED" FROM

299
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:19,366
UNDER OTHER PEOPLE'S FEET.

300
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:20,166
SO MANY, IN FACT, THAT SOME HAVE

301
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:20,800
NEARLY BEEN FORGOTTEN, LIKE THIS

302
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:21,366
PIECE OF LOCAL HISTORY THAT

303
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:21,866
RECENTLY MADE THE NEWS.

304
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:22,533
IN MANHATTAN BEACH,

305
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,400
CALIFORNIA, A HOUSE ON THE SAND

306
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:26,000
CAN COST UP TO $20 MILLION, AND

307
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:27,900
ANTHONY BRUCE'S FAMILY USED TO

308
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,700
OWN TWO OCEANFRONT LOTS.

309
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:31,733
I SHOULD BE A MILLIONAIRE

310
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,733
STANDING HERE T... TALKING TO

311
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
YOU TODAY.

312
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,633
MORE THAN 100 YEARS AGO, HIS

313
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,466
GREAT-GREAT-GRANDPARENTS, WILLA

314
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:39,700
AND CHARLES BRUCE, BOUGHT THE

315
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:41,600
LAND FOR ABOUT $1,200.

316
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:42,333
THEY BUILT A RESORT CALLED

317
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,500
"BRUCE'S LODGE."

318
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:45,533
THE KU KLUX KLAN WAS INVOLVED

319
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,700
IN HARASSING THEM.

320
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:49,866
THEY BURNED A CROSS RIGHT OUT

321
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:50,066
HERE.

322
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:51,242
AND WHEN THAT DIDN'T DRIVE

323
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:53,200
THEM AWAY, THE CITY GOVERNMENT

324
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,666
DECIDED TO TAKE THE PROPERTY

325
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:56,066
UNDER THE GUISE OF EMINENT

326
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:58,200
DOMAIN.

327
00:08:58,266 --> 00:08:59,633
WOW.

328
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,909
SO WHEN THE CROSS BURNING DIDN'T

329
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:02,366
DRIVE THE BRUCES OUT OF TOWN,

330
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:03,633
THE CITY CALLED IN A LAWYER TO

331
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,200
FINISH THE JOB.

332
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:07,633
AND THAT TELLS YOU A LOT ABOUT

333
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,833
HOW RACISM IN AMERICA WORKS.

334
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,800
SURE, THE VIGILANTE RACISTS ARE

335
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:12,466
SPOOKY.

336
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:13,966
BUT YOU'VE REALLY GOTTA WORRY

337
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:15,466
WHEN THE MOTHERFUCKERS WITH

338
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:16,000
ADVANCED DEGREES SHOW UP.

339
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:16,633
WHAT MANHATTAN BEACH DID TO THE

340
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,266
BRUCE FAMILY WAS CLEARLY

341
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,200
UNFORGIVABLE.

342
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,200
AND TO ITS CREDIT, THE CITY

343
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:20,033
SEEMS TO BE TRYING TO RECKON

344
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,166
WITH HOW TO DEAL WITH WHAT

345
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:23,066
HAPPENED.

346
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:24,733
ALTHOUGH IT'S ALSO PLACING SOME

347
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:25,300
PRETTY HARD LIMITS ON THAT

348
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:27,200
RECKONING.

349
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,633
THE COUNCIL DID AUTHORIZE

350
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,766
SPENDING $350,000 ON ART TO

351
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,866
COMMEMORATE THE FAMILY, AND THIS

352
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:34,333
WEEK, VOTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND

353
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,100
CONDEMN WHAT HAPPENED... BUT

354
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,133
CHOSE NOT TO OFFER AN OFFICIAL

355
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
APOLOGY.

356
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:40,166
IT'S AWFUL.

357
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:41,266
IT'S WRONG.

358
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,233
WE'RE NOT THAT COMMUNITY NOW.

359
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,633
I WOULDN'T LIVE HERE IF WE WERE

360
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,500
A RACIST COMMUNITY, AND MY

361
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:46,676
FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS WOULD NOT

362
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,833
LIVE HERE AS WELL.

363
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,833
OKAY, COUPLE OF THINGS.

364
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,200
MANHATTAN BEACH'S

365
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:53,700
POPULATION IS ONLY 0.5% BLACK,

366
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:55,000
SO EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT THAT

367
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:57,100
COMMUNITY NOW, YOU DON'T LOOK

368
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,133
UN-LIKE IT.

369
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,366
IF YOU TOOK

370
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,333
SOMETHING WORTH $20 MILLION,

371
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,533
$350,000 DOESN'T COVER IT.

372
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,500
ESPECIALLY WHEN NONE OF THAT

373
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,866
MONEY WENT TOWARD THE FAMILY

374
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:11,200
YOU STOLE IT FROM.

375
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:13,466
THERE'S PRETTY OBVIOUSLY ONLY

376
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:14,733
TWO WAYS OF MAKING THIS RIGHT:

377
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,300
GIVE THE BRUCES $20 MILLION OR

378
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,833
GIVE THEM THEIR LAND BACK.

379
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,266
AND INCREDIBLY, THE LATTER MIGHT

380
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,300
ACTUALLY HAPPEN.

381
00:10:21,366 --> 00:10:22,542
BECAUSE L.A. COUNTY, WHICH OWNS

382
00:10:22,566 --> 00:10:23,726
THE LAND, RECENTLY RELEASED A

383
00:10:23,766 --> 00:10:24,842
PLAN FOR RETURNING IT TO THE

384
00:10:24,866 --> 00:10:32,866
BRUCES.

385
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:35,966
WHICH IS, TO PUT IT MILDLY,

386
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:36,600
ABOUT TIME!

387
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,500
IT'S LITERALLY BEEN CALLED

388
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:39,966
BRUCE'S BEACH SINCE 2006.

389
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:40,766
IS THE APOSTROPHE S A FUCKING

390
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:41,200
JOKE TO YOU PEOPLE?

391
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:41,933
IT INDICATES POSSESSION.

392
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,633
SO THE STORY OF BRUCE'S BEACH

393
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,200
MIGHT ACTUALLY END WITH

394
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:43,866
SOMETHING APPROACHING JUSTICE.

395
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:44,633
LAND WAS TAKEN AWAY.

396
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,233
LAND IS GIVEN BACK.

397
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,666
AND I WANT YOU TO KEEP THE

398
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:48,666
ELEGANCE OF THAT SOLUTION IN

399
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:50,166
MIND AS WE TALK ABOUT A FAR MORE

400
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,833
INSIDIOUS AND WIDESPREAD FORM OF

401
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,200
WEALTH APPROPRIATION, AND THAT

402
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:56,666
IS HOUSING DISCRIMINATION.

403
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:57,666
THERE IS A LONG HISTORY OF IT IN

404
00:10:57,733 --> 00:10:59,133
AMERICA... AND WE WILL GET TO

405
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,242
THAT IN A MINUTE... BUT BEFORE

406
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:01,666
WE DO, LET'S JUST START WITH ITS

407
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:04,266
EFFECTS.

408
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,966
CURRENTLY, ONLY 45% OF BLACK

409
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,400
HOUSEHOLDERS OWN THEIR HOMES,

410
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,166
COMPARED WITH NEARLY 74% OF

411
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:11,233
WHITES.

412
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,900
AND SINCE HOME OWNERSHIP IS A

413
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:14,176
KEY COMPONENT OF WEALTH, IT'S NO

414
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,276
SURPRISE THAT THE WEALTH GAP

415
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,900
BETWEEN WHITE AND BLACK FAMILIES

416
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:18,900
IS SO HUGE, MANY LITERALLY DON'T

417
00:11:18,966 --> 00:11:21,566
COMPREHEND IT.

418
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:23,800
ONE RECENT SURVEY FOUND MOST

419
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:24,986
PEOPLE THINK THAT, FOR EVERY

420
00:11:25,033 --> 00:11:26,833
$100 IN WEALTH HELD BY A WHITE

421
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,333
FAMILY, A BLACK FAMILY HAS $90,

422
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,500
WHEN THE TRUTH IS, IT'S ACTUALLY

423
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:34,500
CLOSER TO $13, WITH THE MEDIAN

424
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:37,933
WHITE FAMILY HAVING A NET WORTH

425
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,800
OF AROUND $188,000 AND THE

426
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:40,666
MEDIAN BLACK FAMILY HAVING JUST

427
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,333
OVER $24,000.

428
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,866
BUT THE EFFECTS OF HOUSING

429
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:48,400
DISCRIMINATION GO WELL BEYOND

430
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:49,033
WEALTH, BECAUSE QUESTIONS ABOUT

431
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,166
WHERE YOUR HOUSE IS AND HOW MUCH

432
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:54,200
IT'S WORTH IMPACT SO MANY THINGS

433
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:54,766
ABOUT YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE.

434
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:55,400
FOR INSTANCE, BECAUSE A KEY WAY

435
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:56,746
AMERICANS PAY FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS

436
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,666
IS THROUGH PROPERTY TAXES,

437
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:00,600
BETTER HOMES LEAD TO BETTER

438
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:01,866
SCHOOLS, BETTER TEACHERS, AND

439
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:03,133
MORE RESOURCES, WHICH IN TURNS

440
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,600
LEADS BACK TO BETTER

441
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,166
NEIGHBORHOODS IN GENERAL,

442
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:07,133
INCLUDING CLEANER STREETS,

443
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,766
CLEANER AIR, AND, CRUCIALLY,

444
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:09,909
ONLY THE MOST EXCLUSIVE AND

445
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:12,033
FUCKABLE TREES.

446
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,100
IS THAT TREE A BAKERY?

447
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:14,800
BECAUSE IT'S.

448
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:15,600
GOT.

449
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,100
CAKES.

450
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,066
THAT TREE... DON'T JUST LET THE

451
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:18,933
AUDIO OF THIS PLAY IN THE

452
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,766
BACKGROUND WHILE YOU'RE WORKING,

453
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:23,733
CLICK BACK ON THE YOUTUBE TAB

454
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,966
AND LOOK AT ME...

455
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:26,900
THAT TREE CAN GET IT.

456
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:27,833
SO IF IT'S LED TO A WEALTH GAP

457
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,976
THIS MASSIVE AND CONSEQUENCES

458
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,233
THIS WIDE-RANGING, TONIGHT,

459
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,420
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HOUSING

460
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:32,866
DISCRIMINATION, THE DAMAGE IT'S

461
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:33,866
DONE, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHAT

462
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:39,233
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

463
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:39,800
SOME OF YOU MAY ALREADY

464
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:43,133
KNOW WHAT THE LAST PART IS GOING

465
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,266
TO BE AND MIGHT EVEN BE

466
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:44,933
SHOUTING IT AT YOUR SCREENS, BUT

467
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,800
PLEASE, DON'T SPOIL IT FOR

468
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:47,900
EVERYONE ELSE...

469
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:48,666
LET'S LET IT BE A SURPRISE.

470
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:49,266
AND LET'S START IN THE EARLY

471
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,466
20TH CENTURY, BECAUSE THAT'S

472
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:51,166
WHEN THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY

473
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:52,600
REALLY BEGAN TO GROW, AND AS IT

474
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,066
DID, WHITE PEOPLE MOVED QUICKLY

475
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:55,333
TO CODIFY THE DISTANCE BETWEEN

476
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:57,200
THEM AND BLACK PEOPLE.

477
00:12:57,266 --> 00:12:59,333
ONE MAJOR WAY THIS HAPPENED WAS

478
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,542
THROUGH "RACIAL COVENANTS"...

479
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:01,742
ESSENTIALLY BYLAWS WRITTEN INTO

480
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:02,700
DEEDS OR NEIGHBORHOOD

481
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:04,733
REGULATIONS FORBIDDING THE SALE

482
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,200
OF A HOUSE TO A NON-WHITE

483
00:13:06,266 --> 00:13:08,600
PERSON.

484
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:09,709
AND INCREDIBLY, THESE COVENANTS

485
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:10,909
WERE SO WIDESPREAD THAT MANY ARE

486
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:13,766
STILL TECHNICALLY ON THE BOOKS.

487
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,400
A TEXAS NEWS STATION RECENTLY

488
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:17,400
UNEARTHED ONE IN A LOCAL SUBURB

489
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:18,300
AND SHOWED IT TO UNSUSPECTING

490
00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:19,700
RESIDENTS THERE.

491
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,000
SECTION TWO, PAGE THREE

492
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,300
READS, "NONE OF THE LOTS SHALL

493
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:23,609
BE CONVEYED, LEASED, OR OCCUPIED

494
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:25,100
BY ANY PERSON OTHER THAN OF THE

495
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,400
CAUCASIAN RACE.

496
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:28,733
IT PROVIDES AN EXCEPTION FOR

497
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,966
THOSE EMPLOYED AS SERVANTS.

498
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:32,933
"...THE PERSON OTHER THAN THE

499
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,300
CAUCASIAN RACE."

500
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:35,166
WHEW.

501
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:36,400
OKAY.

502
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:38,833
WELL, QUITE!

503
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,142
THE TONE OF THAT "WHEW, OKAY" IS

504
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,566
USUALLY RESERVED FOR A FEW

505
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:43,266
FINDING OUT YOUR GRANDMA

506
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,933
IS STILL SENDING NUDES, THAT

507
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,766
JEREMY PIVEN LAUNCHED A PODCAST

508
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,233
CALLED "HOW YOU LIVIN',

509
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,400
J PIVEN," AND THAT YOUR

510
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:50,576
NEIGHBORHOOD TECHNICALLY STILL

511
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,300
HAS BYLAWS PROHIBITING BLACK

512
00:13:51,366 --> 00:13:54,066
PEOPLE FROM LIVING THERE.

513
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,633
AND WHILE RACIAL COVENANTS WERE

514
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,333
DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, WHAT

515
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,542
REALLY TURBOCHARGED SEGREGATION

516
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:00,709
WAS WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

517
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:02,166
GOT INVOLVED.

518
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:03,533
IN THE 1930s, THE NEW DEAL

519
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,100
ESTABLISHED THE FEDERAL HOUSING

520
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,300
ADMINISTRATION AND THE HOME

521
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:08,900
OWNERS LOAN CORPORATION OR

522
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:10,733
"HOLC"... WHICH IS,

523
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,700
INCIDENTALLY, ALSO FRENCH FOR

524
00:14:11,766 --> 00:14:16,666
"HULK."

525
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:18,166
EH, HOLC... HOW YOU SAY, ER...

526
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,233
LE SMUUSH.

527
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:20,166
THE IDEA OF THESE TWO AGENCIES

528
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:21,133
WAS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE

529
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,342
TO BUY AND RETAIN HOUSES DURING

530
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:23,766
THE GREAT DEPRESSION, AND THEY

531
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,100
WERE PROMOTED AT THE TIME

532
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,000
THROUGH NEWSREELS LIKE THIS:

533
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,966
THIS COUPLE IS GOING THROUGH

534
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:29,633
A MODEL HOUSE NOW... SUPPOSE WE

535
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,866
FOLLOW THEM.

536
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:32,100
THE HUSBAND APPARENTLY ISN'T

537
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,066
VERY KEEN ABOUT IT ALL, BUT YOU

538
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:34,666
KNOW HOW WIVES ARE.

539
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:36,300
THIS CHEERFUL ROOM WITH ITS MANY

540
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:37,442
HANDY CABINETS IMPRESSES EVEN

541
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:39,533
THIS SKEPTIC, AND HIS WIFE IS

542
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,742
ENTRANCED BY THE MODERN FLAT TOP

543
00:14:40,766 --> 00:14:42,300
STOVE.

544
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:44,533
TOO BAD THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT...

545
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,933
AH, BUT MAYBE THEY CAN.

546
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,066
WELL, ACCORDING TO THIS SIGN,

547
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:49,900
THEY CAN BUY THIS HOUSE WITH

548
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:51,142
MONTHLY PAYMENTS THAT ARE LESS

549
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,066
THAN THEY NOW SPEND FOR RENT.

550
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:53,766
WOW.

551
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:54,533
THAT IS A VERY AFFORDABLE HOUSE

552
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,500
FOR TWO PEOPLE THAT CLEARLY DO

553
00:14:55,566 --> 00:14:57,300
NOT GET ALONG.

554
00:14:57,366 --> 00:14:59,100
THEY

555
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,500
HATE THEIR WIVES AND ANYTHING

556
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,700
THAT WOULD MAKE HER HAPPY.

557
00:15:01,766 --> 00:15:02,866
EVERY MOMENT WITH THEM IS

558
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:03,933
TORTURE.

559
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,233
AND MAYBE A NEW HOUSE WOULD

560
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,466
HELP, AS NEITHER OF THEM WILL

561
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:08,133
LEAVE THIS WRETCHED MARRIAGE

562
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,500
BECAUSE IT'S THE 1930s.

563
00:15:09,566 --> 00:15:10,333
IT'S UP TO THE BABY TO SAVE

564
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,266
THEM!"

565
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,400
THE PITCH WAS THAT THE

566
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:16,000
GOVERNMENT WOULD INSURE YOUR

567
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:17,306
LOAN SO THAT BANKS WOULD ACCEPT

568
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:18,566
A SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER DOWN

569
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:20,000
PAYMENT THAN WAS STANDARD AT THE

570
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:21,833
TIME, WITH MUCH LOWER INTEREST

571
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,566
RATES, AND GIVE YOU DECADES TO

572
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:26,000
PAY IT OFF.

573
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:27,466
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

574
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:28,742
ESSENTIALLY INVENTED THE MODERN

575
00:15:28,766 --> 00:15:29,900
HOME MORTGAGE, AND IT WORKED

576
00:15:29,966 --> 00:15:31,866
INCREDIBLY WELL.

577
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:33,266
MILLIONS BOUGHT HOMES WHO COULD

578
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,233
NEVER OTHERWISE HAVE AFFORDED

579
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,700
THEM, BEGINNING A CYCLE OF

580
00:15:36,766 --> 00:15:38,200
STABLE, GENERATIONAL WEALTH THAT

581
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:40,033
CONTINUES TO THIS DAY.

582
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,766
IT WAS A GREAT IDEA.

583
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:49,166
I CANNOT STRESS THAT ENOUGH.

584
00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:50,866
WHICH IS WHY IT IS SO TRAGIC

585
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:52,233
THAT BUILT DIRECTLY INTO THAT

586
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,700
PLAN WAS THE INTENTIONAL

587
00:15:53,766 --> 00:15:54,333
EXCLUSION OF BLACK PEOPLE.

588
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,033
FOR INSTANCE, HOLC DEVELOPED

589
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,200
MAPS THAT COLOR-CODED AREAS

590
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:57,400
GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, OR RED

591
00:15:57,466 --> 00:15:59,133
BASED ON THEIR

592
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,766
CREDIT-WORTHINESS.

593
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:04,300
A NEIGHBORHOOD EARNED A RED

594
00:16:04,366 --> 00:16:08,933
COLOR... OR BE "REDLINED"... IF

595
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,933
ANY AFRICAN AMERICANS LIVED IN

596
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,633
IT AT ALL, AT WHICH POINT, THE

597
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,400
AREA WAS ESSENTIALLY INELIGIBLE

598
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:13,933
FOR ANY MORTGAGES.

599
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,533
MEANWHILE, WHEN IT CAME TO NEW

600
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,133
DEVELOPMENTS, THE FHA'S

601
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,666
UNDERWRITING MANUAL ESSENTIALLY

602
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:18,233
MANDATED THAT COMMUNITIES HAVE

603
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,442
RACIALLY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS

604
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:20,833
AS A PREREQUISITE TO RECEIVE

605
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,033
MORTGAGE INSURANCE.

606
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,733
THESE POLICIES ALONE HAD A

607
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,366
DEVASTATING EFFECT ON BLACK

608
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:27,600
COMMUNITIES, SIGNIFICANTLY

609
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,400
EXPANDING AND LOCKING IN

610
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:31,200
SEGREGATION.

611
00:16:31,266 --> 00:16:36,033
AND SOME DEVELOPERS ENSURED

612
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,900
THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO QUALIFY

613
00:16:37,966 --> 00:16:38,433
FOR LOANS BY GOING TO SOME

614
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,066
RIDICULOUS LENGTHS.

615
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:40,700
HERE IN DETROIT, THERE WAS A

616
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,300
DEVELOPER THAT WANTED TO BUILD A

617
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:44,133
DEVELOPMENT FOR WHITES, AND THEY

618
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,666
WANTED TO GET FHA LOANS.

619
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:47,400
AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAID,

620
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:49,166
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

621
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:50,566
THERE'S A BLACK COMMUNITY KIND

622
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:51,776
OF CLOSE BY, YOU DON'T GET THE

623
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,000
GOOD LOANS."

624
00:16:56,066 --> 00:16:57,566
AND SO THE DEVELOPER, IN AN

625
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:59,033
EFFORT TO TRY TO FIX THAT, BUILT

626
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,933
A 6-FOOT-TALL WALL, A FOOT DEEP,

627
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,800
TO SEPARATE THE BLACK COMMUNITY

628
00:17:03,866 --> 00:17:04,866
FROM THE EMERGING WHITE

629
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,333
COMMUNITY.

630
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,766
AND THEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

631
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:08,833
GAVE THE LOAN.

632
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:10,333
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

633
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,033
AND WHAT MAKES IT SOMEHOW WORSE

634
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,209
IS THAT THAT WALL WAS ONLY SIX

635
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,800
FEET TALL.

636
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:16,733
THAT'S JUST NOT THAT TALL.

637
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,842
THAT'S LIKE THE HEIGHT OF A

638
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:18,866
FRIDGE.

639
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,100
OR A MATTRESS.

640
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,433
OR SNOOP DOGG.

641
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,633
SNOOP'S 6'4."

642
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,033
HE COULD VERY EASILY SEE OVER

643
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,000
IT.

644
00:17:25,066 --> 00:17:27,233
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

645
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,066
SNOOP MAKING DIRECT EYE CONTACT

646
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:29,466
WITH YOU OVER YOUR STUPID,

647
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:30,400
RACIST WALL?

648
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,400
HOW IS THAT HELPING ANYONE?

649
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:33,400
AND ALL OF THIS IS OBVIOUSLY

650
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:35,466
WHITE PEOPLE

651
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:36,733
BASICALLY WROTE "BLACK PEOPLE

652
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,600
CAN'T LIVE HERE" ON PIECES OF

653
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:39,946
PAPER AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

654
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,142
SAID "IF YOU WHITE PEOPLE DON'T

655
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,333
HAVE ONE OF THOSE PIECES OF

656
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,066
PAPER, YOU CAN'T GET A LOAN."

657
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:47,466
IF EVERYTHING HAD JUST STOPPED

658
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,600
THERE, THE DAMAGE WOULD ALREADY

659
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:51,666
HAVE BEEN IMMENSE.

660
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:53,333
BUT IT VERY MUCH DID NOT STOP

661
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,166
THERE.

662
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:55,800
AFTER WORLD WAR II, THE GI BILL

663
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:56,666
GAVE RETURNING SERVICE MEMBERS

664
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:57,853
ACCESS TO HOME LOANS WITH AS

665
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,400
LITTLE AS NO DOWN PAYMENT, WHICH

666
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:02,133
IS GREAT!

667
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,366
BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF

668
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:05,300
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS STILL

669
00:18:05,366 --> 00:18:06,486
REFUSED TO APPROVE LOANS FOR

670
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:08,266
AFRICAN AMERICANS, MEANING THAT

671
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,900
BLACK SERVICE MEMBERS RETURNED

672
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:11,500
HOME ONLY TO BE SHUT OUT OF

673
00:18:11,566 --> 00:18:13,333
HOMEOWNERSHIP IN THE RAPIDLY

674
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,000
EXPANDING SUBURBS, ONE OF THE

675
00:18:15,066 --> 00:18:17,800
MOST FAMOUS EXAMPLES OF WHICH

676
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:19,366
WAS LEVITTOWN, A DEVELOPMENT ON

677
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,400
LONG ISLAND OF OVER 17,000

678
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:22,333
HOMES.

679
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,733
AND TO ENSURE GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

680
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,266
TO BUILD THEM, THE DEVELOPER HAD

681
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,866
THE CONTRACTS STATE THAT "THE

682
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:28,166
HOME COULD NOT BE USED OR

683
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,966
OCCUPIED BY ANY PERSON OTHER

684
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:30,733
THAN MEMBERS OF THE CAUCASIAN

685
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,133
RACE."

686
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,500
AND WHEN BLACK PEOPLE DID TRY TO

687
00:18:34,566 --> 00:18:36,233
BUY HOMES THERE, THEY WERE TOLD

688
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,433
IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS JUST HOW

689
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,900
UNWELCOME THEY WERE, AS THIS

690
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:42,566
WOMAN REMEMBERS.

691
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:44,033
WE WENT TO THE OFFICE WHERE

692
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,700
THE GENTLEMAN WAS SHOWING THE

693
00:18:44,766 --> 00:18:48,233
HOUSES.

694
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,376
SO MY HUSBAND SAID TO HIM, MY

695
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,733
WIFE AND I ARE INTERESTED IN,

696
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,042
YOU KNOW, PURCHASING A HOME HERE

697
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:57,200
IN LEVITTOWN.

698
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:58,133
HE SAID, GET YOUR OUT OF

699
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,066
HERE.

700
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:02,433
WOW.

701
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,233
THAT IS A SWEET LADY

702
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:03,900
RECOUNTING AN APPALLING STORY IN

703
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:04,900
JUST THE MOST MATTER-OF-FACT

704
00:19:04,966 --> 00:19:05,200
WAY.

705
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,100
BUT I GUESS FOR BLACK PEOPLE IN

706
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,000
AMERICA, YOU ASK YOUR GRANDMA TO

707
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:07,766
TELL YOU A WHOLESOME STORY ABOUT

708
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,333
SOMETHING LIKE THE FIRST SCHOOL

709
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,233
DANCE SHE WENT TO OR HOW SHE

710
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:11,966
AND GRANDPA BOUGHT A HOUSE, AND

711
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:12,766
IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE YOU'RE

712
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:13,842
SUDDENLY IN THE MIDDLE OF AN

713
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:15,766
AUGUST WILSON PLAY.

714
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,400
AND CRUCIALLY, WHITE PEOPLE WHO

715
00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:18,766
WERE ABLE TO BUY HOMES IN

716
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,066
LEVITTOWN COULD ACCUMULATE

717
00:19:20,133 --> 00:19:22,100
MASSIVE WEALTH.

718
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,900
IN 1948, HOMES THERE SOLD FOR

719
00:19:24,966 --> 00:19:27,033
AROUND $8,000, OR ABOUT $75,000

720
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,933
IN TODAY'S MONEY, AND THEY

721
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,200
CURRENTLY SELL FOR $350,000 OR

722
00:19:32,266 --> 00:19:34,366
MORE, MEANING FAMILIES WHO

723
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:36,333
BOUGHT HOMES BACK IN 1948 GAINED

724
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,733
MORE THAN $200,000 IN WEALTH.

725
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,233
THAT'S A LOT!

726
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,833
SO, QUICK SIDE NOTE: IF YOU'RE

727
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,140
YOUNG, WHITE, AND LOOKING FOR A

728
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,333
REAL RETURN ON INVESTMENT,

729
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,633
FORGET ABOUT YOUR AMC AND

730
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,700
GAMESTOP STONKS.

731
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:49,876
WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO IS

732
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,076
GET A TIME MACHINE, TRAVEL BACK

733
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,466
TO THE 1940s, AND BUY A HOUSE

734
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:53,900
IN A SEGREGATED SUBURB.

735
00:19:53,966 --> 00:19:55,266
IT'S THE SAFEST INVESTMENT

736
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,233
YOU'LL EVER MAKE.

737
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,233
AND LEVITTOWN AND DETROIT WERE

738
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,766
BY NO MEANS ALONE.

739
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,300
THIS HAPPENED AGAIN AND AGAIN,

740
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:03,866
SO MUCH SO THAT THE EXCLUSION OF

741
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:05,366
BLACK PEOPLE FROM THESE FEDERAL

742
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:08,333
PROGRAMS WAS NEARLY ABSOLUTE.

743
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,800
FOR INSTANCE, A SURVEY OF 13

744
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:12,266
CITIES IN MISSISSIPPI IN 1947

745
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,900
FOUND THAT... OF THE MORE THAN

746
00:20:14,966 --> 00:20:16,566
3,200 LOANS GIVEN TO RETURNING

747
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:20,133
VETERANS UNDER THE GI BILL...

748
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,400
ONLY TWO WENT TO

749
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:22,700
AFRICAN AMERICANS.

750
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:24,066
AND NATIONWIDE, IN JUST THE

751
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:25,833
FIRST QUARTER CENTURY OF THE

752
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,100
FEDERAL HOUSING ADMINISTRATION,

753
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,733
THE GOVERNMENT INSURED OVER

754
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,333
$40 BILLION IN LOANS.

755
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,500
THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF NEARLY

756
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:37,366
$400 BILLION TODAY.

757
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:38,509
BUT SOME ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT

758
00:20:38,533 --> 00:20:40,366
98% OF THEM WENT TO WHITE

759
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:40,633
AMERICANS.

760
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,200
98%!

761
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:43,633
IF YOU ATE 98% OF SOMEONE'S

762
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,466
CANNOLI, YOU ATE ALL THEIR

763
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:47,766
CANNOLI.

764
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,533
POINTING OUT THE FACT THEY'VE

765
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
STILL TECHNICALLY GOT 2%

766
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,706
SOMEHOW MAKES IT WORSE.

767
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,909
AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF ALL OF

768
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:56,266
THIS CAN BE HARD FOR SOME TO

769
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,433
THINK ABOUT.

770
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,033
EARLIER THIS YEAR, CBS'

771
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,966
TONY DOKOUPIL DID A STORY ABOUT

772
00:21:02,033 --> 00:21:02,833
HIS GRANDPARENTS' HOMETOWN OF

773
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,976
LYNDHURST, NEW JERSEY, AND IN

774
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,766
DOING SO, BROKE SOME DIFFICULT

775
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:06,633
NEWS TO THE TOWN'S UNOFFICIAL

776
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,700
HISTORIAN.

777
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,366
WAIT A MINUTE.

778
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:10,100
YOU'RE TELLING ME THEY WERE ONLY

779
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,309
GOING TO MORTGAGE WHITE PEOPLE?

780
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,800
YEAH, YEAH.

781
00:21:13,866 --> 00:21:18,566
FOR YOU TO SAY THAT LYNDHURST

782
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:19,166
IS THE WAY IT IS BECAUSE IT

783
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:19,866
ALMOST IMPLIES THAT LYNDHURST

784
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:21,866
WAS RACIST.

785
00:21:21,933 --> 00:21:22,766
NO, THIS IS MY FAMILY TOO.

786
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:23,366
I'M NOT SAYING THAT.

787
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:24,000
I'M SAYING THAT WE... I'M SAYING

788
00:21:24,066 --> 00:21:24,366
WE HAD NO IDEA.

789
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:25,000
YOU'RE RIGHT.

790
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:25,933
MOST PEOPLE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN

791
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,566
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD

792
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:28,433
THIS PROGRAM IN PLACE.

793
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,233
OKAY, FIRST, I GET THAT

794
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,100
THIS IS UNCOMFORTABLE, BUT I

795
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,335
WILL SAY, IF A WHITE PERSON SAYS

796
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,673
"THAT ALMOST IMPLIES BLANK WAS

797
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:37,166
RACIST" AND ANOTHER ONE SAYS

798
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:38,746
"NO, NO, THIS IS MY FAMILY TOO,"

799
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,698
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE MATTER'S
CLOSED.

800
00:21:41,749 --> 00:21:44,538
IF TWO WHITE PEOPLE ARE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT IF SOMETHING'S

801
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:48,271
RACIST, NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN,
IT PROBABLY IS.

802
00:21:48,694 --> 00:21:50,881
AS FOR THAT MAN'S CLAIM "MOST

803
00:21:50,906 --> 00:21:53,186
PEOPLE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN

804
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:55,142
THIS PROGRAM WAS IN PLACE," HOLD
ON.

805
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:55,866
NONE OF THIS WAS A SECRET AT THE

806
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:56,533
TIME.

807
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,366
THE LINK BETWEEN THE RACIAL

808
00:21:57,433 --> 00:21:58,266
MAKEUP OF YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND

809
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:58,966
THE VALUE OF YOUR HOME WAS SO

810
00:21:59,033 --> 00:22:00,033
WELL-ESTABLISHED, SOME

811
00:22:00,066 --> 00:22:01,500
SPECULATORS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT

812
00:22:01,566 --> 00:22:02,766
TO BUY HOMES ON THE CHEAP

813
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,100
THROUGH A PRACTICE CALLED

814
00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:08,323
"BLOCKBUSTING."

815
00:22:08,348 --> 00:22:09,425
THAT'S WHERE THEY'D GO TO A

816
00:22:09,449 --> 00:22:10,716
WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD AND MAKE IT

817
00:22:10,741 --> 00:22:12,041
SEEM LIKE BLACK PEOPLE WERE

818
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:13,066
MOVING IN.

819
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,466
THEY WOULD HIRE A BLACK WOMAN TO

820
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:18,933
WALK UP AND DOWN THE STREET WITH

821
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,266
A STROLLER, OR CALL HOMES AND

822
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,476
ASK TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE WITH A

823
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,400
STEREOTYPICALLY BLACK NAME.

824
00:22:23,466 --> 00:22:24,666
THE IDEA WAS THAT SIMPLY BY

825
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:26,166
DOING THIS, THE SPECULATORS

826
00:22:26,233 --> 00:22:27,366
COULD PANIC WHITE HOMEOWNERS

827
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:29,200
INTO SELLING THEIR HOMES AT A

828
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:30,700
LOSS.

829
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,466
THIS TACTIC WAS INCREDIBLY

830
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:33,100
EFFECTIVE.

831
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,966
BUT I WILL SAY, SOME WHITE

832
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:35,933
HOMEOWNERS DID STAND FIRM...

833
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,040
LIKE THIS AMAZING WOMAN IN

834
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:39,766
WELL, I HAPPENED TO BE

835
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,266
SITTING ON THE STEPS WITH A

836
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,966
FRIEND OF MINE, AND THE MAN THAT

837
00:22:43,033 --> 00:22:44,193
HAD GOTTEN THE HOUSE FROM THE

838
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:45,700
WOMAN NEXT DOOR, HE CAME UP AND

839
00:22:45,766 --> 00:22:47,333
HE SAID TO ME, "WOULD YOU LIKE

840
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,200
TO SELL?"

841
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:50,346
AND I SAID, "NO, I COULDN'T

842
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,442
AFFORD TO SELL, BECAUSE I CAN'T

843
00:22:51,466 --> 00:22:54,966
AFFORD TO GO ANYWHERE ELSE."

844
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:56,233
AND HE SAID, "YOU WON'T SELL?"

845
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,433
I SAID, "NO."

846
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,366
HE SAYS, "WELL"...

847
00:23:01,433 --> 00:23:02,033
PARDON ME, ANGIE, THESE ARE NOT

848
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,633
MY WORDS.

849
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,500
HE SAID, "WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO

850
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:08,566
DO WHEN THESE MOVE IN

851
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,133
HERE, AND THEY GET OUT ON THE

852
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,800
PORCH IN THE SUMMER AND THEY

853
00:23:09,866 --> 00:23:10,200
DRINK BEER?"

854
00:23:10,266 --> 00:23:11,442
I SAID, "HELL, I'M GOING TO JOIN

855
00:23:11,466 --> 00:23:14,166
THEM."

856
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,866
LOOK, I KNOW THIS STORY

857
00:23:15,933 --> 00:23:16,700
IS FULL OF TERRIBLE PEOPLE AND

858
00:23:16,766 --> 00:23:17,366
UNMITIGATED RACISM, SO WE SHOULD

859
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:17,900
PROBABLY TAKE A MOMENT TO

860
00:23:17,966 --> 00:23:18,866
CELEBRATE A LADY WHO JUST WANTED

861
00:23:18,933 --> 00:23:19,833
TO GET DRUNK ON HER PORCH WITH

862
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,433
HER NEIGHBORS REGARDLESS OF

863
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,766
THEIR COLOR.

864
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,933
I LOVE SO MANY THINGS ABOUT

865
00:23:24,733 --> 00:23:27,300
I LOVE ROSE'S DON'T-GIVE-A-FUCK

866
00:23:27,366 --> 00:23:28,442
ENERGY, BUT ALSO ANGIE'S "ROSE

867
00:23:28,466 --> 00:23:30,533
IS GONNA ROSE" RESPONSE.

868
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,233
BECAUSE WHEN ROSE SAID, "PARDON

869
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:32,800
ME, ANGIE, THESE ARE NOT MY

870
00:23:32,866 --> 00:23:34,266
WORDS," THAT WAS FOR US.

871
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:35,666
ANGIE KNEW.

872
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:36,942
SHE KNOWS WHO ROSE IS AND SHE'S

873
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:38,766
MADE PEACE WITH IT.

874
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,466
THESE WOMEN HAVE TALKED.

875
00:23:40,533 --> 00:23:41,166
THERE'S A HISTORY IN THAT

876
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:42,500
RELATIONSHIP.

877
00:23:42,566 --> 00:23:43,566
BLESS YOU, ROSE.

878
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,966
AND BLESS ANGIE TOO.

879
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:46,733
JUST BECAUSE ROSE WAS AN ALLY

880
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,266
DOESN'T MEAN SHE WAS ALWAYS AN

881
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:51,033
EASY PERSON TO BE AROUND.

882
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,466
AND WHEN YOU PUT ALL OF THIS

883
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:53,966
TOGETHER, IT IS NO WONDER THAT

884
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:55,400
BY THE LATE '60s, FAIR HOUSING

885
00:23:55,466 --> 00:23:56,733
HAD BECOME A CORE ISSUE FOR THE

886
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,566
CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.

887
00:23:58,633 --> 00:23:59,809
MARTIN LUTHER KING'S EFFORTS TO

888
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:02,066
COMBAT HOUSING DISCRIMINATION IN

889
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:04,333
CHICAGO WERE MET WITH FIERCE

890
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,300
RESISTANCE, AND UPRISINGS

891
00:24:06,366 --> 00:24:08,266
BEGAN TO BREAK OUT ACROSS THE

892
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:10,000
COUNTRY... UNREST THAT REACHED A

893
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:11,700
FEVER PITCH IN THE WAKE OF

894
00:24:11,766 --> 00:24:12,466
KING'S ASSASSINATION.

895
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:14,133
LBJ AND CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS

896
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,700
TRIED TO SETTLE THINGS DOWN WITH

897
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:18,066
THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1968,

898
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:20,633
WITH SECTIONS 8 AND 9 BEING THE

899
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,266
FAIR HOUSING ACT, AND SECTION

900
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:25,900
10, TITLED "CIVIL OBEDIENCE"...

901
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:27,233
AN ANTI-RIOT ACT... WHICH IS A

902
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,466
PRETTY EFFECTIVE WAY OF SAYING

903
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:31,366
"THAT'S OUR FINAL OFFER, WE'VE

904
00:24:31,433 --> 00:24:32,766
GONE ABOUT AS FAR AS WE'RE GOING

905
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:33,466
WITH THIS WHOLE 'CIVIL RIGHTS'

906
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:34,800
THING."

907
00:24:34,866 --> 00:24:36,000
THE FAIR HOUSING ACT MADE

908
00:24:36,066 --> 00:24:37,966
HOUSING DISCRIMINATION ILLEGAL

909
00:24:38,033 --> 00:24:39,700
AND ALSO REQUIRED THE GOVERNMENT

910
00:24:39,766 --> 00:24:40,876
TO "AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHER" FAIR

911
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,109
HOUSING... IN OTHER WORDS, TAKE

912
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:44,800
AN ACTIVE ROLE IN INTEGRATION.

913
00:24:44,866 --> 00:24:48,600
AND TO HIS CREDIT, NIXON'S

914
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:54,700
HOUSING SECRETARY,

915
00:24:54,766 --> 00:24:55,600
GEORGE ROMNEY, MITT'S DAD,

916
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:56,233
ACTUALLY TRIED

917
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:56,933
TO DO THAT AND DEVELOPED A

918
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,500
PROGRAM TO WITHHOLD FEDERAL

919
00:24:57,566 --> 00:24:58,366
GRANTS FROM COMMUNITIES THAT

920
00:24:58,433 --> 00:24:59,533
REFUSED TO INTEGRATE.

921
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,500
BUT NIXON THEN QUICKLY STEPPED

922
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:01,900
IN, CALLING IT OFF, AND PUBLICLY

923
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:07,900
REPUDIATING THE WHOLE PLAN.

924
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:09,333
CONCERNING GOVERNOR ROMNEY'S

925
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,800
PLAN, TO WHAT EXTENT SHOULD THE

926
00:25:10,866 --> 00:25:12,233
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT USE ITS

927
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,866
LEVERAGE TO PROMOTE RACIAL

928
00:25:13,933 --> 00:25:18,133
INTEGRATION IN SUBURBAN HOUSING?

929
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:18,866
IT IS NOT THE POLICY OF THIS

930
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:19,666
GOVERNMENT TO USE THE POWER OF

931
00:25:19,733 --> 00:25:20,966
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR

932
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:21,900
FEDERAL FUNDS IN ANY OTHER WAY,

933
00:25:21,966 --> 00:25:22,900
IN WAYS NOT REQUIRED BY THE LAW,

934
00:25:22,966 --> 00:25:23,666
FOR FORCED INTEGRATION OF THE

935
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:24,733
SUBURBS.

936
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,400
I BELIEVE THAT FORCED

937
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:27,400
INTEGRATION OF THE SUBURBS IS

938
00:25:27,466 --> 00:25:32,033
NOT IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST.

939
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,866
YEAH, NOT GREAT.

940
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:33,933
AND IT IS WORTH REMINDING

941
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:34,500
YOURSELF ONCE IN A WHILE JUST

942
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:35,866
HOW DEEPLY WEIRD NIXON WAS.

943
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:37,213
HE'S BEEN RENDERED SO SILLY BY A

944
00:25:37,266 --> 00:25:38,600
LIFETIME OF CARTOONISH

945
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:40,633
IMPRESSIONS, IT'S GENUINELY

946
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,833
UNSETTLING TO WATCH HIM MAKE

947
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,966
UNYIELDING EYE CONTACT WHILE

948
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:46,300
SAYING "I BELIEVE THAT FORCED

949
00:25:46,366 --> 00:25:47,066
INTEGRATION OF THE SUBURBS IS

950
00:25:47,133 --> 00:25:48,433
NOT IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST"

951
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,800
LIKE A COLD ROBOT POWERED BY

952
00:25:49,866 --> 00:25:54,700
RACISM.

953
00:25:54,766 --> 00:25:55,700
ALL I'M SAYING IS, IT REALLY

954
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:56,333
SAYS SOMETHING THAT

955
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,333
THE MOST HUMAN VERSION OF NIXON

956
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,233
IS THE ONE WHERE HE'S A CARTOON

957
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:58,766
HEAD IN A JAR.

958
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:00,200
AND WHAT NIXON MADE VERY CLEAR

959
00:26:00,266 --> 00:26:01,133
THERE IS THAT THE FEDERAL

960
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,833
GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT STEP IN TO

961
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,900
INTEGRATE NEIGHBORHOODS, MEANING

962
00:26:04,966 --> 00:26:05,733
NEIGHBORHOODS WEREN'T GOING TO

963
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,566
INTEGRATE.

964
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:08,800
PRICES IN WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS

965
00:26:08,866 --> 00:26:10,266
WERE NOW TOO HIGH, AND THE

966
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,466
RACIAL WEALTH GAP WAS FIRMLY

967
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:13,000
ENTRENCHED.

968
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:15,200
AND EVEN THOUGH OVERT

969
00:26:15,266 --> 00:26:16,376
DISCRIMINATION WAS NOW ILLEGAL,

970
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,100
THERE WERE, AND STILL ARE, MANY,

971
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:19,666
MANY WAYS FOR NEIGHBORHOODS TO

972
00:26:19,733 --> 00:26:22,366
KEEP THEMSELVES WHITE.

973
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:23,509
SOMETIMES IT'S THROUGH ZONING...

974
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:25,633
LIKE BANNING MULTI-FAMILY HOMES

975
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:31,800
AND SOMETIMES IT COMES IN THE

976
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:33,009
FORM OF REALTORS STEERING BUYERS

977
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:34,042
AWAY FROM CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS

978
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:35,133
ON A RACIAL BASIS.

979
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,276
THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO

980
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,442
THAT, BUT IT STILL HAPPENS ALL

981
00:26:37,466 --> 00:26:45,466
THE TIME.

982
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,109
A FEW YEARS AGO, "NEWSDAY" HAD

983
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:47,700
TESTERS OF MULTIPLE RACES POSE

984
00:26:47,766 --> 00:26:48,300
AS HOMEBUYERS ON LONG ISLAND,

985
00:26:48,366 --> 00:26:48,766
AND THE BLACK TESTERS

986
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:49,466
EXPERIENCED DISPARATE TREATMENT

987
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:50,233
NEARLY HALF THE TIME.

988
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,309
IN SOME CASES, THEY WERE SENT TO

989
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:52,600
VASTLY DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOODS.

990
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:54,066
BUT EVEN A REALTOR WHO "NEWSDAY"

991
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:56,066
SAID GAVE OUT SIMILAR LISTINGS

992
00:26:56,133 --> 00:26:58,366
TO BLACK AND WHITE BUYERS...

993
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:00,133
THEREBY STAYING OUTSIDE

994
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,100
THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF

995
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:03,766
"STEERING"... ACCOMPANIED THEM

996
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:05,400
WITH SOME NOT-SO-SUBTLE TIPS

997
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:06,033
THAT SHE ONLY GAVE TO THE WHITE

998
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,033
TESTER.

999
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,900
AND THEN THERE'S POCKETS OF

1000
00:27:10,966 --> 00:27:17,566
PORT JEFF TOO, THAT, YOU KNOW,

1001
00:27:17,633 --> 00:27:18,400
DOWN BY THE TRAIN THERE'S AN

1002
00:27:18,466 --> 00:27:19,733
AREA THERE.

1003
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,666
WHAT I SAY IS ALWAYS, TO WOMEN,

1004
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:22,933
FOLLOW THE SCHOOL BUS, SEE THE

1005
00:27:22,966 --> 00:27:23,976
MOMS THAT ARE HANGING OUT ON THE

1006
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,433
CORNERS.

1007
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,676
THERE WAS ONE FELLA WHO, LIKE,

1008
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,333
INSISTED ON THIS HOUSE AND THE

1009
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,266
WIFE WAS PREGNANT, HAD A LITTLE

1010
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:30,766
ONE.

1011
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:32,366
AND I SAID TO HIM, I CAN'T SAY

1012
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:33,709
ANYTHING, BUT I ENCOURAGE YOU...

1013
00:27:33,733 --> 00:27:34,466
I WANT YOU TO GO THERE AT 10:00

1014
00:27:34,533 --> 00:27:35,366
AT NIGHT WITH YOUR WIFE TO BUY

1015
00:27:35,433 --> 00:27:36,266
DIAPERS.

1016
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:37,533
GO TO THAT 7-ELEVEN.

1017
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,900
THEY DIDN'T BUY THERE.

1018
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:44,066
NO, THAT'S GREAT.

1019
00:27:44,133 --> 00:27:44,833
I HAVE TO SAY IT WITHOUT

1020
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,766
SAYING IT, YOU KNOW.

1021
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:46,366
YOU HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE

1022
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:47,000
AREAS, YOU KNOW.

1023
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:47,333
YES.

1024
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,700
I DON'T WANT TO USE THE WORD

1025
00:27:48,766 --> 00:27:49,400
"STEER," BUT I TRY TO... I USE

1026
00:27:49,466 --> 00:27:50,133
ANOTHER WORD.

1027
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,600
I EDUCATE IN THE AREA, YOU KNOW.

1028
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:53,233
OH, WELL, THAT'S ALL

1029
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,133
RIGHT THEN.

1030
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,433
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T SAY THE

1031
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,000
WORD "STEER," IT'S OKAY.

1032
00:27:57,066 --> 00:27:58,200
IT'S LIKE TABOO.

1033
00:27:58,266 --> 00:27:59,733
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T SAY ONE OF

1034
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,400
THE FIVE WORDS ON THE CARD,

1035
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:03,866
YOU'RE COMPLETELY IN THE CLEAR.

1036
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,733
AT EVERY STEP OF THE PROCESS,

1037
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,700
BLACK HOMEBUYERS ARE FACED WITH

1038
00:28:06,766 --> 00:28:08,433
DISCRIMINATION.

1039
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,333
A FEW YEARS AGO, REPORTERS

1040
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,966
CRUNCHED THROUGH 31 MILLION LOAN

1041
00:28:12,033 --> 00:28:14,200
APPLICATIONS AND FOUND THAT

1042
00:28:14,266 --> 00:28:15,566
AFRICAN AMERICANS CONTINUE TO BE

1043
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:17,500
ROUTINELY DENIED CONVENTIONAL

1044
00:28:17,566 --> 00:28:18,576
MORTGAGE LOANS AT MUCH HIGHER

1045
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,033
RATES, EVEN CONTROLLING FOR

1046
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:20,900
INCOME, LOAN AMOUNT, AND

1047
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:22,600
NEIGHBORHOOD.

1048
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:24,500
AND EVEN IF YOU OWN YOUR HOME,

1049
00:28:24,566 --> 00:28:25,800
THE SIMPLE ACT OF HAVING IT

1050
00:28:25,866 --> 00:28:27,800
APPRAISED CAN BE TAINTED BY

1051
00:28:27,866 --> 00:28:29,833
DISCRIMINATION.

1052
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,166
THIS WOMAN HAD HAD HER HOME

1053
00:28:31,233 --> 00:28:33,033
APPRAISED TWICE, BUT THE VALUES

1054
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,866
SEEMED LOW TO HER, SO SHE DID A

1055
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:41,133
LITTLE EXPERIMENT.

1056
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,933
I MET WITH TWO OF MY

1057
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,433
GIRLFRIENDS.

1058
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,066
BOTH OF THEM ARE MARRIED TO

1059
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:43,866
WHITE MEN, AND I WAS LIKE, OKAY,

1060
00:28:43,933 --> 00:28:44,766
I NEED TO BORROW ONE OF YOUR

1061
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:45,166
HUSBANDS.

1062
00:28:45,233 --> 00:28:45,966
WHEN THE THIRD APPRAISER

1063
00:28:46,033 --> 00:28:46,566
CAME, DUFFY WAS GONE.

1064
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:47,966
HER FRIEND'S HUSBAND POSED AS

1065
00:28:48,033 --> 00:28:48,600
HER BROTHER.

1066
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:49,500
THE RESULT?

1067
00:28:49,566 --> 00:28:51,766
DUFFY'S HOME WAS APPRAISED FOR

1068
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:53,466
$259,000, MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT

1069
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:55,400
OF HER PREVIOUS TWO APPRAISALS.

1070
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:58,533
I SCREAMED WITH JOY.

1071
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,800
I JUST WAS... I WAS SO ELATED.

1072
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:03,433
AND THEN IT JUST... IT QUICKLY

1073
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,000
DISSIPATED.

1074
00:29:06,066 --> 00:29:13,366
AND THEN I JUST CRIED.

1075
00:29:13,433 --> 00:29:16,900
BECAUSE THIS IS AN ACTUAL

1076
00:29:16,966 --> 00:29:17,833
"THERE IT IS" IN THAT

1077
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,000
I'M THE THING

1078
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:20,900
THAT'S THE DEVALUING MY HOUSE.

1079
00:29:20,966 --> 00:29:22,166
LOOK, THAT'S JUST

1080
00:29:22,233 --> 00:29:23,366
AWFUL.

1081
00:29:23,433 --> 00:29:25,166
WE ALL KNOW THE ONLY TIME THE

1082
00:29:25,233 --> 00:29:26,376
ADDITION OF A WHITE MAN SHOULD

1083
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,509
INCREASE VALUE TO ANYTHING IS IF

1084
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:29,000
THAT THING IS A MOVIE AND THAT

1085
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:30,633
WHITE MAN IS STANLEY TUCCI.

1086
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,300
OTHERWISE, IT'S JUST NOT OKAY.

1087
00:29:34,366 --> 00:29:36,533
AND WHEN YOU TAKE ALL THIS

1088
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,533
TOGETHER... THE REDLINING, THE

1089
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,900
BLOCKBUSTING, THE STEERING, AND

1090
00:29:38,966 --> 00:29:41,166
NOT LEAST, THE FEDERAL

1091
00:29:41,233 --> 00:29:42,866
GOVERNMENT'S INVOLVEMENT... IT

1092
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:44,200
ALL BECOMES CLEAR THAT THE MYTH

1093
00:29:44,266 --> 00:29:45,309
OF WHITE AMERICANS' POST-WAR

1094
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:46,933
PROSPERITY, POWERED BY INGENUITY

1095
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,700
AND SELF-RELIANCE, LEAVES A LOT

1096
00:29:48,766 --> 00:29:51,366
OUT.

1097
00:29:51,433 --> 00:29:53,033
AND THE PROBLEM IS, THERE ARE

1098
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,866
MANY WHITE PEOPLE WHO ARE

1099
00:29:54,933 --> 00:29:56,142
UNWILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS...

1100
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:57,433
OR, EVEN IF THEY DO, ARE UNSURE

1101
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,100
WHAT TO DO WITH THE INFORMATION.

1102
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,100
REMEMBER TONY DIKOUPIL'S STORY

1103
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,800
ABOUT LYNDHURST?

1104
00:30:02,866 --> 00:30:04,000
THE MAYOR THERE, AND THE

1105
00:30:04,066 --> 00:30:05,176
HISTORIAN, HAD VERY DIFFERENT

1106
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,433
REACTIONS TO WHAT THEY WERE

1107
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,733
LEARNING.

1108
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,533
THE ONE THING THAT I'M

1109
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,166
STRUGGLING WITH, AND THIS IS

1110
00:30:11,233 --> 00:30:12,900
AS... AS SOMEBODY WHOSE FAMILY

1111
00:30:12,966 --> 00:30:15,400
CAME THROUGH HERE, IS WHEN I

1112
00:30:15,466 --> 00:30:17,666
LOOKED AT THE OLD MAPS, JUST

1113
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,800
OVER THE RIVER, THE AREAS WERE

1114
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:23,933
REDLINED BY THE FEDERAL

1115
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,466
GOVERNMENT, MEANING THEY WEREN'T

1116
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:26,666
WORTHY OF MORTGAGES.

1117
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:28,300
AND LYNDHURST WASN'T REDLINED.

1118
00:30:28,366 --> 00:30:29,466
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT

1119
00:30:29,533 --> 00:30:30,466
KNOWLEDGE?

1120
00:30:30,533 --> 00:30:31,333
YOU MOVE ON.

1121
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,633
COME ON, IT'S ALL GOD'S PEOPLE.

1122
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,933
NOW THAT WE DO KNOW...

1123
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,333
RIGHT.

1124
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,533
WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT?

1125
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,533
YOU KNOW, THAT'S A GOOD

1126
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,933
QUESTION.

1127
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,600
I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT,

1128
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:43,466
TONY.

1129
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:44,400
I WISH I DID.

1130
00:30:44,466 --> 00:30:45,400
OKAY, WE'LL GET TO THE

1131
00:30:45,466 --> 00:30:48,833
CONTENT OF WHAT THEY'RE SAYING

1132
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,266
IN A SECOND, BUT FIRST, I GOTTA

1133
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:51,542
KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT MAYOR

1134
00:30:51,566 --> 00:30:53,000
AND HOW HE CAME INTO OFFICE.

1135
00:30:53,066 --> 00:30:54,333
IF I HAD TO GUESS, A COUPLE

1136
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,766
OF CANDIDATES DISAPPEARED.

1137
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:56,400
YOU CAN'T HAVE A RUN-OFF IF ONLY

1138
00:30:56,466 --> 00:30:57,033
ONE CANDIDATE IS ON THE BALLOT,

1139
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,300
CAN YOU?

1140
00:30:58,366 --> 00:31:00,500
BUT AS NICE AS IT SOUNDS TO JUST

1141
00:31:00,566 --> 00:31:02,633
MOVE ON, THAT'S NOT DEALING WITH

1142
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,100
THE UNDERLYING INJURY HERE.

1143
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:07,033
BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU HAD A MAGIC

1144
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,900
WAND AND WERE ABLE TO STOP EVERY

1145
00:31:08,966 --> 00:31:10,500
FACET OF HOUSING DISCRIMINATION

1146
00:31:10,566 --> 00:31:12,933
GOING FORWARD, YOU STILL

1147
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,800
WOULDN'T BE UNDOING THE DAMAGE

1148
00:31:16,866 --> 00:31:17,666
THAT HAS BEEN DONE.

1149
00:31:17,733 --> 00:31:19,133
HOME PRICES HAVE RISEN MUCH MORE

1150
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,700
THAN WAGES IN THE LAST 50 YEARS,

1151
00:31:20,766 --> 00:31:22,000
SO BUYING A HOME TODAY DOESN'T

1152
00:31:22,066 --> 00:31:23,500
CARRY THE SAME ECONOMIC PROMISE

1153
00:31:23,566 --> 00:31:25,900
AS IT DID WHEN THE FHA STARTED.

1154
00:31:25,966 --> 00:31:28,100
IN FACT, BY ONE ESTIMATE, IF WE

1155
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:29,933
DO "DO NOTHING AND MOVE ON," IT

1156
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,933
WOULD TAKE 200 YEARS FOR THE

1157
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,233
WEALTH GAP TO DISAPPEAR ON ITS

1158
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,733
OWN.

1159
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,033
AND YET, SO OFTEN, EFFORTS TO

1160
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,260
ADDRESS THE LEGACY OF HOUSING

1161
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,300
DISCRIMINATION HAVE BEEN

1162
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:44,566
RESOLUTELY COLOR-BLIND.

1163
00:31:44,633 --> 00:31:46,133
HERE IS JOE BIDEN ON THE

1164
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,833
CAMPAIGN TRAIL JUST LAST YEAR:

1165
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,800
MY PLAN FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS

1166
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:51,766
TO CLOSE THE WEALTH GAP IS TO

1167
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:53,266
INVEST IN AFRICAN AMERICAN

1168
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:54,266
HOME OWNERSHIP.

1169
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:57,266
THAT INCLUDES MY INSISTING THAT

1170
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:57,900
THERE WILL BE A $15,000

1171
00:31:57,966 --> 00:31:59,076
FIRST-TIME HOME BUYER TAX CREDIT

1172
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,800
FOR EVERYONE.

1173
00:32:00,866 --> 00:32:02,100
WELL, HOLD ON THERE,

1174
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:05,100
JOE.

1175
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:06,933
"FOR EVERYONE"?

1176
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,733
THAT MIGHT SOUND GREAT, BUT IT

1177
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,600
ALSO FUNDAMENTALY DILUTES WHAT

1178
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:13,200
YOU'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO DO

1179
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:13,400
HERE.

1180
00:32:13,466 --> 00:32:14,033
BECAUSE WE'VE IMMEDIATELY GONE

1181
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:14,600
FROM TARGETED INVESTMENT IN

1182
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:15,233
BLACK HOME OWNERSHIP TO A BROAD

1183
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,200
TAX CREDIT FOR EVERYBODY.

1184
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:19,376
AND WE SURE SEEM TO BECOME A

1185
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,542
RAINBOW COALITION AS SOON AS THE

1186
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:21,566
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STARTS

1187
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,733
HANDING OUT CASH, DON'T WE?

1188
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,400
AND OUR FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY

1189
00:32:26,466 --> 00:32:28,200
TARGET SOLUTIONS BASED ON RACE

1190
00:32:28,266 --> 00:32:29,966
HAS DOOMED POTENTIAL FIXES IN

1191
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:31,333
THE PAST.

1192
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,766
IN THE '70s, WE PASSED THE

1193
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:35,400
COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT

1194
00:32:35,466 --> 00:32:37,000
REQUIRING BANKS TO APPROVE LOANS

1195
00:32:37,066 --> 00:32:40,100
IN LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS.

1196
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,333
BUT WE DIDN'T SPECIFY WHO THE

1197
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,509
LOANS HAD TO GO TO, WITH ONE

1198
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:43,676
ANALYSIS IN PHILADELPHIA SHOWING

1199
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,433
THAT BANKS AND LENDERS FAVORED

1200
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,733
WHITE BORROWERS, EVEN IN

1201
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,800
MAJORITY-BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS,

1202
00:32:49,866 --> 00:32:51,000
MAKING THIS WELL-MEANING ACT

1203
00:32:51,066 --> 00:32:52,433
BASICALLY A GENTRIFICATION

1204
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,833
MACHINE.

1205
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,600
ALTHOUGH NOT A LITERAL

1206
00:32:56,666 --> 00:32:57,333
GENTRIFICATION MACHINE, OF

1207
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,266
COURSE, AS WE ALL KNOW, THOSE

1208
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:00,066
ARE OBVIOUSLY E-SCOOTERS.

1209
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:02,166
SO THAT APPROACH OF "MOVE ON,

1210
00:33:02,233 --> 00:33:03,666
WE'RE ALL GOD'S PEOPLE" HASN'T

1211
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:05,400
FIXED THE PROBLEM.

1212
00:33:05,466 --> 00:33:07,500
BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT SECOND GUY,

1213
00:33:07,566 --> 00:33:09,033
WHO SAID HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT WE

1214
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,900
SHOULD DO ABOUT IT, BUT WISHES

1215
00:33:09,966 --> 00:33:12,366
HE HAD THE ANSWER?

1216
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:15,100
IF THAT IS TRUE, IF HE HONESTLY

1217
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:16,266
WANTS TO KNOW WHAT A MAJOR

1218
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:17,509
COMPONENT OF THE ANSWER SHOULD

1219
00:33:17,533 --> 00:33:21,600
PROBABLY BE, I'VE GOT SOME GOOD

1220
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,742
NEWS FOR HIM, BECAUSE IT EXISTS,

1221
00:33:22,766 --> 00:33:25,000
IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD, AND

1222
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:26,109
IT'S THE SAME ANSWER THAT MANY

1223
00:33:26,133 --> 00:33:27,600
BLACK VIEWERS HAVE BEEN SHOUTING

1224
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:28,906
AT THEIR SCREEN FOR THE LAST 20

1225
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:29,600
MINUTES.

1226
00:33:29,666 --> 00:33:31,366
BECAUSE IT'S REPARATIONS.

1227
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:32,476
AND THE FIRST THING TO SAY ABOUT

1228
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,742
THIS IS THAT IT IS BY NO MEANS A

1229
00:33:33,766 --> 00:33:35,066
NEW ARGUMENT.

1230
00:33:35,133 --> 00:33:36,700
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN MAKING THE CASE

1231
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:38,042
FOR REPARATIONS FOR GENERATIONS,

1232
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:39,200
AND THE HISTORY OF HOUSING

1233
00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:41,133
DISCRIMINATION SPECIFICALLY MADE

1234
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,133
UP A LARGE PART OF TA-NEHISI

1235
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,500
COATES' AWARD-WINNING ESSAY "THE

1236
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:45,800
CASE FOR REPARATIONS" SEVEN

1237
00:33:45,866 --> 00:33:47,700
YEARS AGO.

1238
00:33:47,766 --> 00:33:49,433
AND YET, EVEN THOUGH REPARATIONS

1239
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,800
ARE CLEARLY NECESSARY,

1240
00:33:50,866 --> 00:33:52,933
PRACTICAL, AND THE RIGHT THING

1241
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,833
TO DO, A POLL RECENTLY FOUND

1242
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,800
ONLY ONE IN TEN WHITE PEOPLE

1243
00:33:56,866 --> 00:33:58,366
FAVOR THEM.

1244
00:33:58,433 --> 00:34:00,300
AND SOME DISMISS THE SUBJECT

1245
00:34:00,366 --> 00:34:01,866
RIGHT OUT OF HAND.

1246
00:34:01,933 --> 00:34:03,300
YEAH, I DON'T THINK

1247
00:34:03,366 --> 00:34:05,233
REPARATIONS FOR SOMETHING THAT

1248
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,409
HAPPENED 150 YEARS AGO FOR WHOM

1249
00:34:06,433 --> 00:34:07,476
NONE OF US CURRENTLY LIVING ARE

1250
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:12,200
RESPONSIBLE IS A GOOD IDEA.

1251
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:14,266
WE'VE, YOU KNOW, TRIED TO DEAL

1252
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:16,200
WITH OUR ORIGINAL SIN OF SLAVERY

1253
00:34:16,266 --> 00:34:19,266
BY FIGHTING A CIVIL WAR, BY

1254
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:20,133
PASSING A LANDMARK CIVIL RIGHTS

1255
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,366
LEGISLATION.

1256
00:34:23,433 --> 00:34:25,000
WE'VE ELECTED AN

1257
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:26,433
AFRICAN AMERICAN PRESIDENT.

1258
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,633
I THINK WE'RE ALWAYS A WORK IN

1259
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,600
PROGRESS IN THIS COUNTRY.

1260
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:31,966
BUT NO ONE CURRENTLY ALIVE WAS

1261
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:36,533
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.

1262
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,200
WOW.

1263
00:34:38,266 --> 00:34:39,442
REPARATIONS AREN'T A GOOD IDEA

1264
00:34:39,466 --> 00:34:42,700
BECAUSE "WE'VE ELECTED AN

1265
00:34:42,766 --> 00:34:45,700
AFRICAN AMERICAN PRESIDENT"?

1266
00:34:45,766 --> 00:34:46,533
WHO EXACTLY IS THE "WE" IN THAT

1267
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,266
SENTENCE, MITCH?

1268
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:48,000
BECAUSE AS I REMEMBER IT,

1269
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:48,800
ELECTING THAT PRESIDENT WAS

1270
00:34:48,866 --> 00:34:50,533
BASICALLY YOUR LEAST FAVORITE

1271
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,840
THING AMERICA EVER DID, AND YOU

1272
00:34:51,866 --> 00:34:52,876
VOWED TO DEVOTE EVERY WAKING

1273
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,233
MOMENT TO MAKING SURE IT DIDN'T

1274
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,500
HAPPEN AGAIN.

1275
00:34:55,566 --> 00:34:56,800
"WE TRIED TO DEAL WITH OUR

1276
00:34:56,866 --> 00:34:57,906
ORIGINAL SIN OF SLAVERY BY

1277
00:34:57,966 --> 00:34:59,633
FIGHTING A CIVIL WAR... WHICH I

1278
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,942
DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE A SIDE IN...

1279
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:02,466
BY PASSING CIVIL RIGHTS

1280
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:03,433
LEGISLATION... WHICH I DIDN'T

1281
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,000
HAVE TO TAKE A POSITION ON...

1282
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:07,533
AND BY ELECTING AN

1283
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,033
AFRICAN AMERICAN PRESIDENT...

1284
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:09,933
WHO I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AGAINST.

1285
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,009
THIS COUNTRY HAS COME A LONG

1286
00:35:11,033 --> 00:35:11,466
WAY, AND, WITH GOD AS MY

1287
00:35:11,533 --> 00:35:12,033
WITNESS, IT WILL NOT GO ANY

1288
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,733
FURTHER."

1289
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,809
BUT THE THING IS, WE'RE NOT

1290
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:16,533
ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT

1291
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,709
REPARATIONS FOR SLAVERY HERE...

1292
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:18,500
WE SHOULD, BUT THAT'S A

1293
00:35:18,566 --> 00:35:20,100
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION.

1294
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:21,700
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOUSING

1295
00:35:21,766 --> 00:35:24,133
DISCRIMINATION.

1296
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,133
MITCH McCONNELL WAS BORN IN

1297
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,366
1942.

1298
00:35:26,433 --> 00:35:28,300
THE FAIR HOUSING ACT WASN'T

1299
00:35:28,366 --> 00:35:30,666
PASSED UNTIL 1968.

1300
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:32,233
THIS IS QUANTIFIABLE HARM DONE

1301
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,033
IN OUR LIFETIMES TO PEOPLE WHO

1302
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,766
ARE STILL ALIVE.

1303
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,400
AS FOR WHAT REPARATIONS COULD

1304
00:35:38,466 --> 00:35:43,700
LOOK LIKE, THERE HAS BEEN A BILL

1305
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,566
INTRODUCED IN THE HOUSE FOR

1306
00:35:45,633 --> 00:35:46,966
30 YEARS BY THE LATE

1307
00:35:47,033 --> 00:35:48,666
JOHN CONYERS TO FORM A

1308
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:53,166
COMMISSION TO STUDY THIS, AND

1309
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:54,966
THIS YEAR THE HOUSE JUDICIARY

1310
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:56,466
COMMITTEE VOTED TO ADVANCE IT.

1311
00:35:56,533 --> 00:35:57,200
SO IF WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW

1312
00:35:57,266 --> 00:35:57,833
WHAT REPARATIONS COULD LOOK

1313
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,666
LIKE, WE CAN PASS THAT BILL AND

1314
00:35:58,733 --> 00:35:59,166
FIND OUT.

1315
00:35:59,233 --> 00:36:00,233
WE DON'T REALLY

1316
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,442
NEED TO STUDY THE "WHETHER," WE

1317
00:36:01,466 --> 00:36:02,100
JUST NEED TO STUDY THE "HOW."

1318
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:03,033
BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT THE

1319
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,500
GOVERNMENT DID, AND WE KNOW THE

1320
00:36:04,566 --> 00:36:06,566
EFFECT IT HAD.

1321
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:10,633
AND THERE ARE POTENTIAL MODELS

1322
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,266
FOR US TO LEARN FROM... FROM

1323
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,866
GERMANY PAYING REPARATIONS TO

1324
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:15,266
HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS TO THE U.S.

1325
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:17,166
PAYING JAPANESE AMERICANS WHO

1326
00:36:17,233 --> 00:36:18,000
WERE INTERNED IN WORLD WAR II.

1327
00:36:18,066 --> 00:36:19,366
AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR MORE

1328
00:36:19,433 --> 00:36:19,900
RECENT EXAMPLES, EVANSTON,

1329
00:36:19,966 --> 00:36:21,206
ILLINOIS, RECENTLY VOTED TO USE

1330
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:21,833
REVENUE FROM LEGAL WEED TO

1331
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,533
PROVIDE GRANTS TO ASSIST BLACK

1332
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,333
PEOPLE WHO LIVED THERE FROM 1919

1333
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,000
TO 1969 AND THEIR DESCENDANTS.

1334
00:36:27,066 --> 00:36:28,333
NOW, DOES THAT PROGRAM FIX

1335
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,533
EVERYTHING?

1336
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,900
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

1337
00:36:34,966 --> 00:36:35,833
ITS FIRST PHASE MAKES AVAILABLE

1338
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,733
UP TO $25,000 FOR EACH

1339
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,366
PARTICIPANT, WHO CAN ONLY SPEND

1340
00:36:38,433 --> 00:36:38,933
THAT MONEY ON BUYING OR

1341
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,500
RENOVATING A HOUSE OR PAYING

1342
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,333
DOWN THEIR MORTGAGE.

1343
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,433
AND THE INITIAL BUDGET FOR THE

1344
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,509
PROGRAM IS ONLY $400,000, SO IT

1345
00:36:43,533 --> 00:36:44,900
MIGHT WELL BE LIMITED TO 16

1346
00:36:44,966 --> 00:36:49,700
PEOPLE.

1347
00:36:49,766 --> 00:36:51,166
BUT IT IS AT LEAST A REAL

1348
00:36:51,233 --> 00:36:52,309
ATTEMPT TO BOTH ACKNOWLEDGE AND

1349
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:54,033
REDRESS HARM.

1350
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,933
AND ULTIMATELY, THIS ISN'T

1351
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,866
SOMETHING CITIES, OR EVEN

1352
00:36:55,933 --> 00:36:57,666
STATES, CAN DO ON THEIR OWN.

1353
00:36:57,733 --> 00:37:00,100
IT TOOK THE POWER AND RESOURCES

1354
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:01,666
OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

1355
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:03,366
ENFORCE RACISM ON THIS SCALE,

1356
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:05,233
AND ONLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

1357
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,800
CAN TRULY GRAPPLE WITH THE

1358
00:37:06,866 --> 00:37:08,200
CONSEQUENCES.

1359
00:37:08,266 --> 00:37:09,100
AND THERE ARE SOME... LIKE

1360
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:10,176
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES... WHO HAVE

1361
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,033
SOME PRETTY SPECIFIC IDEAS ON

1362
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,276
WHAT THAT GRAPPLING COULD LOOK

1363
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,866
LIKE.

1364
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:20,833
SO, TO ME, REPARATIONS HAS TO

1365
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,733
BE THREE-PRONGED.

1366
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,800
RECOMMITMENT TO STRONG

1367
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:24,200
ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL RIGHTS

1368
00:37:24,266 --> 00:37:25,442
LAWS, BECAUSE YOU CAN GET THIS

1369
00:37:25,466 --> 00:37:27,800
ECONOMIC PAYMENT, BUT WE KNOW

1370
00:37:27,866 --> 00:37:28,876
THAT BLACK PEOPLE STILL FACE

1371
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,733
DISCRIMINATION IN EVERY ASPECT

1372
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,600
OF AMERICAN SOCIETY.

1373
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,133
AND I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A

1374
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,166
REALLY LARGE INVESTMENT OF

1375
00:37:37,233 --> 00:37:38,600
RESOURCES INTO THE BLACK

1376
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:39,800
COMMUNITY THAT HAVE HAD THAT

1377
00:37:39,866 --> 00:37:41,766
WEALTH EXTRACTED AND HAVE BEEN

1378
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:44,133
DENIED THE ABILITY TO LIVE LIKE

1379
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:44,766
OTHER AMERICANS.

1380
00:37:44,833 --> 00:37:48,633
AND I THINK ANYONE WHO IS

1381
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,633
REPARATIONS THAT IS NOT GOING

1382
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,366
FOR A CASH PAYMENT IS BASICALLY

1383
00:37:53,433 --> 00:37:53,633
AS RACIST.

1384
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,566
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE, IT'S ONLY

1385
00:37:54,633 --> 00:37:55,833
WHEN IT COMES TO BLACK FOLKS

1386
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,833
THAT WE ARE SO CONCERNED WITH

1387
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,366
HOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SPEND.

1388
00:37:59,433 --> 00:38:01,033
DON'T KNOW IF THEY KNOW HOW

1389
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,800
TO SPEND THAT MONEY RESPONSIBLY.

1390
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:04,733
I SAY THIS JOKINGLY BUT HALF

1391
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,900
JOKINGLY.

1392
00:38:05,966 --> 00:38:08,633
IF I WANT TO SPEND MY

1393
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,066
REPARATIONS ON ALL GUCCI, THAT

1394
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:13,133
IS MY RIGHT.

1395
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,100
YEAH, BLACK PEOPLE

1396
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:14,633
SHOULD GET TO

1397
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,233
DECIDE HOW TO SPEND THE MONEY

1398
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,833
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GIVES

1399
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,000
THEM, IN THE SAME WAY WHITE

1400
00:38:17,066 --> 00:38:17,566
PEOPLE GOT TO DECIDE HOW TO

1401
00:38:17,633 --> 00:38:18,100
SPEND ALL THE BILLIONS OF

1402
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:18,766
DOLLARS IN WEALTH IT CREATED FOR

1403
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:19,133
THEM.

1404
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,233
I PROMISE YOU NOT ALL THAT MONEY

1405
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,100
HAS BEEN SPENT RESPONSIBLY.

1406
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:22,700
JUST THINK HOW MUCH OF IT HAS

1407
00:38:22,766 --> 00:38:23,366
GONE TOWARDS THOMAS KINKADE

1408
00:38:23,433 --> 00:38:25,000
PAINTINGS.

1409
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:26,346
THERE IS ONE, AND ONLY ONE, GOOD

1410
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,476
REASON TO BUY A THOMAS KINKADE

1411
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,233
PAINTING, AND THAT'S TO HELP

1412
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,409
CONVINCE THE APPRAISER THAT YOUR

1413
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,666
FRIEND'S WHITE HUSBAND REALLY

1414
00:38:31,733 --> 00:38:36,966
DOES LIVE IN THIS HOUSE.

1415
00:38:37,033 --> 00:38:37,866
THAT IS IT.

1416
00:38:37,933 --> 00:38:38,800
AND I'M NOT SAYING MONEY ALONE

1417
00:38:38,866 --> 00:38:39,700
IS WHAT'S CALLED FOR HERE.

1418
00:38:39,766 --> 00:38:40,809
AS NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES POINTED

1419
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:41,942
OUT, SIMPLY HANDING OUT CASH

1420
00:38:41,966 --> 00:38:43,300
WITHOUT CHANGING ANY OF THE

1421
00:38:43,366 --> 00:38:45,000
UNDERLYING STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS

1422
00:38:45,066 --> 00:38:46,366
THAT PRODUCED INEQUALITY IN THE

1423
00:38:46,433 --> 00:38:48,333
FIRST PLACE WOULD BE A BIG

1424
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,866
MISTAKE.

1425
00:38:52,933 --> 00:38:54,933
THIS IS A BOTH/AND SITUATION.

1426
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,633
BUT ULTIMATELY, THE ONLY REAL

1427
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,266
STRANGE THING ABOUT PAYING

1428
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,666
REPARATIONS TO BLACK PEOPLE IS

1429
00:38:57,733 --> 00:39:00,833
THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE IT YET.

1430
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,433
JUST LIKE IT'S STRANGE THAT IT

1431
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,233
HAS TAKEN SO LONG TO GIVE

1432
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,066
BRUCE'S BEACH BACK TO THE

1433
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:04,833
BRUCES.

1434
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,100
IN BOTH CASES, THE RIGHT THING

1435
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:08,433
TO DO COULDN'T BE CLEARER.

1436
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,133
WHEN YOU DEPRIVE SOMEBODY OF

1437
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,533
SOMETHING, YOU MAKE IT RIGHT BY

1438
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,766
PAYING WHAT YOU OWE.

1439
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:16,066
NOW, FIGURING OUT EXACTLY HOW TO

1440
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:20,966
PAY MIGHT GET COMPLICATED, BUT

1441
00:39:21,033 --> 00:39:22,400
REALIZING THAT YOU HAVE TO

1442
00:39:22,466 --> 00:39:25,133
SHOULD BE PRETTY SIMPLE.

1443
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,600
BECAUSE THIS IS A WOUND THAT WE

1444
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:29,233
ARE ACTIVELY CHOOSING NOT TO

1445
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,566
HEAL, AND IT IS HURTING REAL

1446
00:39:30,633 --> 00:39:32,966
PEOPLE EVERY DAY.

1447
00:39:33,033 --> 00:39:33,966
AND ALSO TRY AND THINK OF THE

1448
00:39:34,033 --> 00:39:34,566
POSITIVES HERE.

1449
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:35,266
BECAUSE IF WE DO CHOOSE TO DO

1450
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:36,233
THE RIGHT THING, AND AFTER ALL

1451
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,200
THESE YEARS, REDRESS THIS WRONG,

1452
00:39:37,266 --> 00:39:39,700
WE MIGHT FINALLY LIVE UP TO THIS

1453
00:39:39,766 --> 00:39:43,666
COUNTRY'S HIGHEST POTENTIAL, AND

1454
00:39:43,733 --> 00:39:45,733
THAT IS TO BECOME A NATION OF

1455
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,833
ROSE AND ANGIES GETTING

1456
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,733
ABSOLUTELY DAY-WASTED ON

1457
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,633
OUR PORCHES.

1458
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,333
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

1459
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,300
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

1460
00:39:55,366 --> 00:39:58,000
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK, GOOD NIGHT!
