1
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,600
HI THERE.

2
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:29,666
WELCOME TO THE SHOW,

3
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,633
STILL COMING TO YOU FROM

4
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,600
THIS BLANK VOID.

5
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:32,400
WHICH HAS STARTED TO FEEL A BIT

6
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:33,633
LIKE HOME.

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,633
AND TO BE HONEST, IT IS PRETTY

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,533
SIMILAR TO ENGLAND IN THAT

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,500
IT'S FRUSTRATINGLY WHITE,

10
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:37,133
IMMEDIATELY DEPRESSING,

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,933
AND I WANT TO GET OUT OF IT

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,292
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

13
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:40,033
LOOK, IT'S BEEN ANOTHER BUSY

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,566
WEEK.

15
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:43,700
CHER TURNED 75, THE HOUSE VOTED

16
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:44,200
TO CREATE AN INDEPENDENT

17
00:00:44,266 --> 00:00:44,333
NO

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:44,866
COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE

19
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:45,933
THE CAPITOL ASSAULT, AND

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,766
THE SUPREME COURT DID THIS:

21
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:48,842
THE SUPREME COURT SAYS IT

22
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:50,000
WILL TAKE UP THE MOST DIRECT

23
00:00:50,066 --> 00:00:51,000
CHALLENGE TO ROE VS. WADE

24
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:52,666
IN A GENERATION THIS FALL.

25
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:52,800
NO

26
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:54,633
AT ISSUE, A MISSISSIPPI LAW

27
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,433
THAT WOULD BAN ALMOST ALL

28
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:56,566
NO

29
00:00:56,633 --> 00:00:57,566
ABORTIONS AFTER 15 WEEKS OF

30
00:00:57,633 --> 00:00:59,200
PREGNANCY.

31
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:00,633
IT'S SIMILAR TO BANS RECENTLY

32
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,966
PASSED IN OTHER CONSERVATIVE

33
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:03,600
LEANING STATES, ALL DESIGNED

34
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,033
TO GET THE NEWLY CONSERVATIVE

35
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,166
SUPREME COURT TO CONFRONT

36
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:07,300
NO

37
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:08,866
ROE VS. WADE HEAD ON.

38
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:10,366
YUP!

39
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:11,733
THE THING CONSERVATIVES HAVE

40
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,633
BEEN TRYING TO DO FOR DECADES

41
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,266
NOW IS FINALLY HAPPENING.

42
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,966
ROLLING BACK ABORTION RIGHTS

43
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:16,700
IS PRETTY MUCH THE REASON

44
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:17,600
THE COUNTRY HAD TO WATCH

45
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:18,800
A HUMAN BEER BONG SCREAM AND

46
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:20,466
CRY DURING A JOB INTERVIEW,

47
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:22,000
THE REASON EVERYONE FREAKED OUT

48
00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:22,933
WHEN AN 87-YEAR-OLD WOMAN DIED,

49
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,566
AND THE REASON WHY THE PRESIDENT

50
00:01:24,633 --> 00:01:25,866
AND HALF HIS INNER CIRCLE ALL

51
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:27,500
GOT COVID IN THE ROSE GARDEN...

52
00:01:27,566 --> 00:01:30,466
WASN'T THAT A FUN COUPLE OF

53
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:30,666
DAYS?

54
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:32,400
ALL OF THAT WAS BUILDING UP TO

55
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:33,576
THIS DEPRESSINGLY SIGNIFICANT

56
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,866
MOMENT.

57
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:36,433
AND STATES HAVE BEEN PUSHING

58
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,400
THE ENVELOPE HARD WHEN IT COMES

59
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:38,533
TO LIMITING ABORTION.

60
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,709
WITH THE LATEST ATTEMPT COMING

61
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:40,966
JUST THIS WEEK IN TEXAS.

62
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:42,666
TEXAS HAS JUST ADOPTED

63
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:43,600
ONE OF THE MOST RESTRICTIVE

64
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:44,833
ANTI-ABORTION LAWS IN THE

65
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,566
NATION.

66
00:01:46,633 --> 00:01:47,566
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR GREG ABBOTT

67
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:49,633
SIGNED THE BILL YESTERDAY.

68
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,266
IT BANS THE PROCEDURE AS EARLY

69
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,966
AS SIX WEEKS INTO A PREGNANCY,

70
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:55,300
BEFORE MANY WOMEN EVEN KNOW

71
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:56,233
THEY'RE PREGNANT.

72
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,300
WELL, THAT'S

73
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,033
INFURIATING.

74
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,366
AND MADE SOMEHOW EVEN WORSE

75
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:01,733
BY THE FACT THEY SEEMED TO CRAM

76
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,666
THE FEW WOMEN IN THE ROOM RIGHT

77
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:04,973
BEHIND ABBOTT AND THEN LET WHAT

78
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:06,833
CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A

79
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,933
JOSEPH A. BANK OF MEN FILL IN

80
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,300
EVERYWHERE ELSE.

81
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:10,576
YOU USUALLY DON'T SEE THAT MANY

82
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,066
MEN IN SUITS LINED UP TO

83
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:12,833
DISAPPOINT WOMEN UNLESS

84
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,733
IT'S THE FIRST NIGHT OF

85
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,166
"THE BACHELORETTE."

86
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:16,309
AND FOR MANY BEHIND THAT BILL,

87
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,266
INCLUDING ONE OF ITS SPONSORS,

88
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:17,966
STATE SENATOR

89
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:19,366
CHARLES SCHWERTNER,

90
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:20,476
RESTRICTING ACCESS TO ABORTION

91
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,233
HAS LONG BEEN A PRIORITY.

92
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,900
IN 2017, HE SILENCED A WITNESS

93
00:02:24,966 --> 00:02:27,400
TESTIFYING AGAINST AN EARLIER

94
00:02:27,466 --> 00:02:29,566
ANTI-ABORTION BILL SO HARD,

95
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:31,500
HIS GAVEL BROKE THE GLASS

96
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:31,966
TABLETOP OF HIS DESK.

97
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:32,900
TAKE A LOOK.

98
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:35,866
SB415 INSERTS ITSELF INTO THE

99
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:36,500
EXAM ROOM BY PUTTING PHYSICIANS

100
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:37,433
IN THE UNCONSCIONABLE POSITION

101
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,933
OF HAVING TO DENY A WOMAN THE

102
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,333
EVIDENCE-BASED COMPASSIONATE

103
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,300
CARE THAT RESULTS IN THE FEWEST

104
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:43,400
COMPLICATIONS.

105
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:44,600
I WANT TO REMIND YOU ALL...

106
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,800
MS. HENNESSY...

107
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:46,976
ESPECIALLY THE DOCTORS ON

108
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,900
THIS COMMITTEE, THAT A VOTE FOR

109
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:48,533
THIS BILL PUTS WOMEN'S LIVES...

110
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:48,933
THANK YOU,

111
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,833
MS. HENNESSY...

112
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,533
ON THE LINE.

113
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,366
YOUR TIME IS DONE...

114
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:51,966
I URGE YOU TO STOP PLAYING

115
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:52,566
WITH REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE

116
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:53,400
AS IF IT'S YOUR OWN POLITICAL

117
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:54,533
PUPPET.

118
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,466
THANK YOU.

119
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:00,566
THANK YOU.

120
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:01,400
YOUR TIME IS DONE.

121
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:03,200
WOW.

122
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,333
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.

123
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,700
WOMEN ARE TOO EMOTIONAL TO MAKE

124
00:03:05,766 --> 00:03:07,433
DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES

125
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,566
...BEST LEAVE IT TO A

126
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:10,300
LEVEL-HEADED, REASONABLE MAN WHO

127
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:11,900
HULKS OUT ON HIS DESK AT WORK.

128
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:15,733
BECAUSE JUST LOOK AT WHAT THAT

129
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,966
FUCKING GAVEL DID.

130
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:17,933
IN EVERY WAY, THAT IS THE EXACT

131
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,733
OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS MEANT BY

132
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,500
"BREAKING THE GLASS CEILING."

133
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:21,966
AND THERE WILL CLEARLY BE MUCH

134
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:23,333
MORE TO SAY ON THIS STORY AS IT

135
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,640
UNFOLDS, BUT FOR NOW, LET'S TRY

136
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,633
AND TAKE A LOOK AT NEWS THAT

137
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,166
ISN'T ACTIVELY DEPRESSING.

138
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:28,866
AND HERE'S ONE... IN

139
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:30,766
PHILADELPHIA, LARRY KRASNER,

140
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:31,909
THE REFORM D.A., WON A HOTLY

141
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,233
CONTESTED PRIMARY AND KRASNER'S

142
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,900
VICTORY WAS BY NO MEANS ASSURED

143
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:36,500
...THE POLICE UNION BACKED

144
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:38,366
HIS OPPONENT IN THE PRIMARY,

145
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:39,566
AND HE'S COME UNDER ATTACK

146
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:40,433
FOR BOLD REFORMS LIKE VOWING TO

147
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,266
NEVER PURSUE A DEATH SENTENCE,

148
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:42,866
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

149
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:44,033
SENT TO PRISON BY SEEKING

150
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,566
ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION,

151
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:47,500
AND TO STOP ILLEGAL

152
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:47,866
STOP-AND-FRISK,

153
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:48,466
REFORM CASH BAIL, AND END THE

154
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:50,833
ABUSE OF CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE.

155
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,633
WHICH IS A STRIKING SET OF

156
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,800
PROMISES, ESPECIALLY COMING FROM

157
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:57,933
A GUY WHOSE FACE-SWEATER COMBO

158
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,866
WHISPERS, "I'VE GOT AUDIOBOOKS

159
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:00,966
ON VINYL."

160
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,142
NOW, KRASNER STILL HAS TO FACE

161
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,633
A REPUBLICAN IN THE GENERAL

162
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:03,900
ELECTION.

163
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:05,000
SPECIFICALLY, THIS MAN,

164
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:06,300
CHARLES PERUTO.

165
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:08,366
WHO IS A LOT.

166
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:09,542
HIS PLATFORM IS THE ANTITHESIS

167
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:10,833
OF KRASNER'S.

168
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,600
AND HE'S SAID, "MY FIRST LINE OF

169
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,333
BUSINESS IS TO MEET WITH EVERY

170
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:15,700
POLICE CAPTAIN.

171
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:16,809
I WANT TO HAVE MY WIFE COOK THEM

172
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,166
DINNER," WHILE ALSO RELEASING

173
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:20,242
THIS VIDEO ON HIS WEBSITE:

174
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:20,900
I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN

175
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:21,700
WEST PHILADELPHIA,

176
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:23,900
64TH AND JEFFERSON.

177
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:24,500
I WAS BORN IN

178
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:26,400
A MIXED NEIGHBORHOOD.

179
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,666
I LOVED IT.

180
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:30,966
IRONICALLY ENOUGH, THE KID

181
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:31,566
I HUNG OUT WITH EVERY DAY WAS

182
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:33,333
MICHAEL JACKSON.

183
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,442
HE DIDN'T SING BUT HE PLAYED

184
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:36,633
HOOPS.

185
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,566
I UNDERSTAND BLACK PEOPLE JUST

186
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:40,666
ABOUT AS WELL AS A BLACK PERSON,

187
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:42,600
NOT GONNA SAY... I'M NOT GONNA

188
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:43,400
SAY EQUAL, BUT PRETTY GOOD.

189
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:44,933
OKAY.

190
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,500
THAT GUY, SITTING IN THAT

191
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:48,000
OFFICE, SAYING HE UNDERSTANDS

192
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:49,366
BLACK PEOPLE AS WELL AS ANY

193
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:50,533
BLACK PERSON ISN'T GREAT.

194
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,033
EVEN IF HE DOES SLIGHTLY WALK IT

195
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,666
BACK BY SAYING, "I'M NOT GONNA

196
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:55,500
SAY EQUAL, BUT PRETTY GOOD"...

197
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:56,433
A LEVEL OF NUANCE NOT SEEN SINCE

198
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,766
PLESSY VS. FERGUSON.

199
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,066
THE WHOLE VIDEO IS 35 MINUTES

200
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:02,309
LONG, AND SHOT IN A SINGLE TAKE,

201
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,866
WITH REAL "NO ONE IN MY FAMILY

202
00:05:03,933 --> 00:05:04,976
WANTS TO LISTEN TO ME ANYMORE

203
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,633
SO THEY SHOWED ME HOW TO USE A

204
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,733
WEBCAM" ENERGY.

205
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,566
AND LOOK, PERUTO IS UNLIKELY TO

206
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:10,500
WIN.

207
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:11,966
BUT HE DOES SPEAK TO THE

208
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:12,666
POST-TRUMP TREND WHERE EXTREME

209
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:15,933
CARTOONISHNESS ISN'T A

210
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,566
DEAL BREAKER FOR CANDIDATES...

211
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:17,966
IT'S A SELLING POINT.

212
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:19,700
TAKE MISSOURI'S MARK McCLOSKEY,

213
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:20,200
WHO YOU MIGHT REMEMBER

214
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:21,200
AS THE MAN WHO POINTED A GUN

215
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:22,733
AT BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTERS

216
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,533
WHILE SOMEHOW MAKING

217
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,500
A POLO SHIRT SLUTTY.

218
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:27,900
WELL, THIS WEEK, HE DECLARED

219
00:05:27,966 --> 00:05:29,126
HIS CANDIDACY FOR SENATE WITH

220
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,566
WHEN THE ANGRY MOB CAME TO

221
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:33,733
DESTROY MY HOUSE AND KILL MY

222
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,876
FAMILY, I TOOK A STAND AGAINST

223
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,200
THEM.

224
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:37,342
NOW I'M ASKING FOR THE PRIVILEGE

225
00:05:37,366 --> 00:05:38,600
TO TAKE THAT STAND FOR ALL OF

226
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,566
US.

227
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:46,700
I WILL NEVER BACK DOWN.

228
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:47,833
OKAY.

229
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,933
SETTING ASIDE THE FACT

230
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,566
McCLOSKEY LOOKS LIKE WHAT YOU'D

231
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:50,800
GET IF SEAN HANNITY FUCKED

232
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:51,766
A PACKING PEANUT... "WHEN THE

233
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:52,400
MOB CAME TO DESTROY MY HOUSE AND

234
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:54,700
MY FAMILY?"

235
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:55,100
GET OVER YOURSELF!

236
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,600
THOSE WERE PROTESTERS WALKING

237
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:57,709
PAST YOUR YARD ON THEIR WAY TO

238
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,100
THE MAYOR'S HOUSE.

239
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,333
NO ONE CARED ABOUT YOU UNTIL

240
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,000
YOU STARTED WAVING GUNS

241
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:02,966
IN THEIR FACE.

242
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,400
IF THERE ARE

243
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:05,966
NATIONWIDE PROTESTS AGAINST

244
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,209
RACISM AND YOUR FIRST RESPONSE

245
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,066
IS "THEY'RE COMING FOR ME!"

246
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:10,500
MAYBE THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT SAYS

247
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:12,166
ABOUT YOU.

248
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:13,100
AND I'D SAY McCLOSKEY'S WAS

249
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,700
THE MOST RIDICULOUS CAMPAIGN

250
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:15,833
ANNOUNCEMENT THIS WEEK,

251
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,600
WERE IT NOT FOR THE FACT THAT

252
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,133
ANDREW GIULIANI... SON OF RUDY

253
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,066
...IS NOW RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR

254
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:22,133
OF NEW YORK.

255
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,533
AND EVEN FOX NEWS POINTED OUT,

256
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,709
HE'S DOING SO ON THE THINNEST

257
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:26,100
POSSIBLE RESUME.

258
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,200
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S

259
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:29,466
BEING ASKED ABOUT YOU IS IF

260
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:30,966
YOU HAVE THE EXPERIENCE

261
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:33,033
TO TAKE ON THE JOB OF GOVERNOR.

262
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,033
YOU WORKED AT THE TRUMP

263
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,833
WHITE HOUSE FOR FOUR YEARS,

264
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,433
AND WERE A PROFESSIONAL GOLFER

265
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,600
BEFORE THAT.

266
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,366
THE TRUTH IS, MARTHA, FROM AN

267
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:40,900
EXPERIENCE PERSPECTIVE, I MAY BE

268
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:42,533
35 YEARS OLD, BUT YOU GOTTA

269
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,500
REMEMBER, I SPENT 32 YEARS...

270
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:45,066
PARTS OF 32 YEARS... IN POLITICS

271
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:47,800
AND IN GOVERNMENT.

272
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:51,100
I'M THE ONLY ANNOUNCED CANDIDATE

273
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,342
THAT ACTUALLY HAS SPENT PARTS OF

274
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:54,566
FIVE DECADES IN POLITICS.

275
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:55,700
SO I MAY LOOK YOUNG, BUT I

276
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:57,000
CERTAINLY FEEL A LOT OLDER.

277
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:58,666
OKAY.

278
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:00,033
THERE IS A LOT TO TAKE APART AND

279
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,500
PUT BACK TOGETHER THERE.

280
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:02,766
ONE... DO YOU THINK YOU

281
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,600
LOOK YOUNG?

282
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,666
BECAUSE IF I HAD TO GUESS

283
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:07,466
YOUR AGE, I'D PUT YOU SOMEWHERE

284
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:09,466
BETWEEN "UNHEALTHY 45" AND

285
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:11,033
"LYING ABOUT AN EARLY RETIREMENT

286
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,176
TO AVOID A SEXUAL HARASSMENT

287
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,766
SETTLEMENT BECOMING PUBLIC."

288
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,533
ALSO, WHY WOULD YOU CLAIM TO

289
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,166
HAVE BEEN IN POLITICS SINCE YOU

290
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:17,700
WERE THREE YEARS OLD?

291
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:19,066
UNLESS YOU'RE COUNTING BEING

292
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:21,166
VIOLENTLY HELD BY YOUR FATHER

293
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,933
DURING HIS FAILED 1989 MAYORAL

294
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,866
CAMPAIGN WHILE DRESSED AS

295
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:28,133
BUSINESS CHUCKY.

296
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,933
ARE YOU COUNTING THAT?

297
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,233
AND EVEN CALLING GIULIANI

298
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,000
A "PROFESSIONAL GOLFER" NEEDS

299
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:31,833
MORE CONTEXT, BECAUSE HIS CAREER

300
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,533
HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE BEING KICKED

301
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,800
OFF THE DUKE GOLF TEAM FOR BAD

302
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:36,433
BEHAVIOR LIKE ALLEGEDLY THROWING

303
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,600
AN APPLE INTO ANOTHER PLAYER'S

304
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,733
FACE SO HARD, THE APPLE

305
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,700
EXPLODED, AND THEN APPEARING ON

306
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:46,700
A GOLF-THEMED REALITY

307
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,366
COMPETITION CALLED "THE BIG

308
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:50,200
BREAK," WHERE HE WAS CLEARLY

309
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:50,500
TYPECAST AS

310
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:51,466
"THE ANNOYING ONE."

311
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:52,133
ANDREW GIULIANI, HE'S TALKY.

312
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,833
THAT'S ALL HE DOES.

313
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,942
I MEAN, HE JUST... YOU KNOW,

314
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:54,766
KIND OF TALKING EVERYONE UP,

315
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:55,333
AND YOU KNOW, BEING ANDREW

316
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:55,933
PRETTY MUCH.

317
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,566
I KNOW HE WAS TALKING A LOT.

318
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:57,266
NICE BALL THERE.

319
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:57,833
DID THAT HIT THE TREE?

320
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,266
DID THAT HIT THE TREE?

321
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,433
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

322
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,433
I KNOW A FEW GUYS WERE

323
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,700
GETTING IRRITATED, INCLUDING

324
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:03,566
MYSELF.

325
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:04,266
THAT'S A TREE!

326
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,666
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT'S NOT

327
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:06,100
A TREE RIGHT THERE?

328
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:06,733
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

329
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,933
THAT'S TOTALLY A TREE.

330
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,900
I MEAN, HE WOULD TALK TO

331
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:11,233
THIS... TO THIS... TO THIS DOOR

332
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,366
IF IT HAD EARS.

333
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:15,133
HE KNOWS HE TALKS TOO MUCH,

334
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,733
AND WE ALL TELL HIM HE DOES BUT,

335
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,666
IT ALMOST MAKES HIM... I FEEL

336
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:19,566
LIKE HE WANTS TO TALK MORE.

337
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:20,466
ANDREW GIULIANI IS A

338
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:21,933
NIGHTMARE.

339
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,100
IMAGINE BEING THE WORST PERSON

340
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,133
ON A GOLF REALITY SHOW.

341
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,833
AND IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE

342
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,333
GIULIANI WINNING THE SUPPORT OF

343
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,900
THE ENTIRE STATE OF NEW YORK

344
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:32,366
WHEN IT SEEMS HE CAN'T EVEN

345
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:33,642
WIN THE SUPPORT OF ALL OF THESE

346
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,033
FUTURE ABSENTEE FATHERS.

347
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,333
IN OTHER WORDS, HIS BASE.

348
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,166
AND YES, ANDREW GIULIANI'S

349
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:39,466
RIDICULOUS.

350
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:40,333
ALL THESE CANDIDATES ARE

351
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,166
RIDICULOUS.

352
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:43,242
BUT IF THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE

353
00:08:43,266 --> 00:08:44,000
TAUGHT US ANYTHING, IT'S THAT

354
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:44,633
RIDICULOUS PEOPLE CAN END UP

355
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,100
GETTING ELECTED.

356
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,166
JUST THREE YEARS AGO, WE DID A

357
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:50,500
PIECE ON STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL

358
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:52,000
...AND IN IT, WE HIGHLIGHTED

359
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:52,566
ANGELA PAXTON, THE WIFE OF

360
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:53,633
TEXAS'S A.G.

361
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,833
JUST LISTEN TO HIS

362
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,133
WIFE, PROUDLY DESCRIBING

363
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,700
PAXTON'S LOVE FOR LAWSUITS

364
00:08:58,766 --> 00:09:00,466
IN WHAT APPARENTLY I LEGALLY

365
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:01,900
HAVE TO CALL "A SONG."

366
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:12,266
A FEW THINGS YOU CAN

367
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,400
THAT WOMAN

368
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:15,700
HAS A GUN, A LITIGIOUS HUSBAND,

369
00:09:15,766 --> 00:09:17,966
AND NO FUTURE IN MUSIC

370
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:18,800
WHATSOEVER.

371
00:09:18,866 --> 00:09:20,333
AND I HAVE SOMEHOW AGED 30 YEARS

372
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,133
SINCE 2018.

373
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,266
A TRULY UNCOMFORTABLE WATCH

374
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,600
FOR MANY REASONS.

375
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:25,676
BUT NOT LONG AFTER THAT SEGMENT

376
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,100
AIRED, ANGELA PAXTON WAS ELECTED

377
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,300
TO THE TEXAS STATE SENATE.

378
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:31,033
THERE SHE IS STANDING BEHIND

379
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,333
GOVERNOR ABBOTT THIS WEEK AS

380
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,166
HE SIGNED TEXAS'S ABORTION BILL.

381
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:35,442
THE POINT IS, YES, THESE PEOPLE

382
00:09:35,466 --> 00:09:36,466
LOOK LIKE CLOWNS.

383
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,600
THEY ARE CLOWNS.

384
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,466
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

385
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:40,466
THAT CLOWNS, WHILE FUNNY, ARE

386
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:42,966
ALSO FUCKING TERRIFYING.

387
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:44,533
AND THIS WEEK GAVE US ANOTHER

388
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,300
REMINDER THAT, IF YOU'RE NOT

389
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:48,300
VERY CAREFUL, YOU CAN WIND UP

390
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:49,033
WITH A CLOWN CAR FULL OF THEM

391
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,566
MAKING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

392
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:52,000
DECISIONS ABOUT YOUR LIFE.

393
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:53,066
AND NOW, THIS.

394
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:59,333
AND NOW...

395
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,409
SAN FRANCISCO CITY COUNCIL

396
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,366
MEETINGS PUBLIC COMMENTS ARE A

397
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:03,000
JOY TO BEHOLD.

398
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:04,466
NOW IT IS TIME FOR PUBLIC

399
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:05,000
COMMENT.

400
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:06,076
ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS OF THE

401
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,600
PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS

402
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,200
THIS BOARD?

403
00:10:10,266 --> 00:10:12,333
PLEASE, NO, STEP FORWARD.

404
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,133
CHEERIOS.

405
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,900
"GOOD MORNING AMERICA."

406
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:23,700
"THE VIEW."

407
00:10:23,766 --> 00:10:24,333
WHAT I SEE HERE ARE A NUMBER

408
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,366
OF REPRESENTATIVES WHO WORSHIP

409
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:28,600
LUCIFER.

410
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:29,866
TOBACCO IS GREAT AT GETTING

411
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,133
BEDBUGS AWAY FROM HER BED.

412
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,166
PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT.

413
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:43,300
FEEL BAD FOR THE DISTRICT, NO

414
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:43,733
SOUP FOR YOU.

415
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:49,366
HE HAS A DICK.

416
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:50,433
YOU HAVE A VAGINA.

417
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,766
THANK YOU, SIR.

418
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,166
THANK YOU, MR. PAULSON.

419
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:14,800
NEXT SPEAKER, PLEASE.

420
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:16,300
MOVING ON.

421
00:11:16,366 --> 00:11:17,542
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

422
00:11:17,566 --> 00:11:18,133
LOCAL NEWS.

423
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,933
THE TRUSTED PLACE PEOPLE GO TO

424
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,866
FIND TRAFFIC, WEATHER, AND HERE

425
00:11:19,933 --> 00:11:20,942
IN NEW YORK, THE SINGLE GREATEST

426
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:21,500
10 SECONDS OF TELEVISION THIS

427
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:22,000
CITY HAS EVER PRODUCED.

428
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:23,933
AT 11:00, PAYING MORE AT THE

429
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,533
GROCER BUT GETTING LESS, WE'LL

430
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,133
TELL YOU HOW TO GET THE MOST!

431
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,333
THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?

432
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,966
PERFECT.

433
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:32,500
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.

434
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,333
THAT IS SUE SIMMONS, BY THE WAY.

435
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,733
SHE SADLY RETIRED IN 2012, AND

436
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,600
HAS BEEN MISSED EVERY DAY SINCE.

437
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,633
BECAUSE IF ANY CITY NEEDS

438
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:40,300
A NEWS ANCHOR WITH AN ABILITY

439
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,733
TO SAY "THE FUCK ARE YOU

440
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,166
DOING?," IT IS NEW YORK.

441
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:46,466
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT LOCAL NEWS

442
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:47,466
A LOT ON THIS SHOW...

443
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:48,033
PARTICULARLY, REGARDING JUST

444
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,600
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO ANY

445
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:52,266
COMMUNITY.

446
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,533
WE ARE CONSTANTLY FEATURING

447
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,200
LOCAL NEWS INVESTIGATIONS

448
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:54,566
IN OUR STORIES.

449
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:55,200
AND IT ISN'T JUST IMPORTANT

450
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:56,500
IN A CIVIC SENSE; IT'S A MAJOR

451
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:58,433
MONEYMAKER FOR STATIONS.

452
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,066
NEXSTAR, ONE OF THE BIGGEST

453
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:01,666
OWNERS OF LOCAL STATIONS,

454
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:03,133
SAID THEY EARNED NEARLY HALF

455
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,400
THEIR ADVERTISING REVENUE FROM

456
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:07,900
SPOTS AIRED DURING LOCAL NEWS

457
00:12:07,966 --> 00:12:08,600
PROGRAMMING.

458
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,566
BUT THE NEED TO BOTH INFORM A

459
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:12,266
COMMUNITY AND MAKE MONEY HAS

460
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,476
ALWAYS BEEN TRICKY TO RECONCILE

461
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,933
...AS YOU CAN TELL FROM THIS

462
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,266
1960s CLIP OF BALTIMORE'S

463
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,266
CHANNEL 11 NEWS.

464
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,933
IN CHICAGO, TODAY,

465
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,076
A WHITE MOB THREW ROCKS AND

466
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,266
BOTTLES AT CIVIL RIGHTS

467
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,033
DEMONSTRATORS.

468
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,566
THAT STORY AFTER THIS MESSAGE

469
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:26,066
ABOUT MASH'S HAM.

470
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:27,966
HE'S A LOVER.

471
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:29,033
NO, NOT THE KIND YOU'RE

472
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:31,200
THINKING OF.

473
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:34,000
HE'S A HAM LOVER.

474
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:35,633
AND ALL HAM LOVERS KNOW THAT

475
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,200
MASH'S HAMS ARE THE BEST YOU

476
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:38,333
CAN BUY.

477
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,266
OKAY, THAT IS A VERY

478
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,166
AWKWARD TRANSITION TO HAVE TO

479
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:42,433
MAKE.

480
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,033
TO GO FROM TEASING A STORY ABOUT

481
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,633
A RACIST MOB WITH A MASH'S HAM

482
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,000
LOGO ON YOUR DESK, TO A MAN WHO

483
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:50,966
IS... NO MATTER WHAT HE SAYS...

484
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:52,153
DEFINITELY FUCKING THAT HAM.

485
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,966
WHICH IS ABSURD.

486
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:54,900
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT,

487
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:56,433
WHEN INSTEAD, YOU COULD BE

488
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,900
FUCKING HONEYSUCKLE WHITE'S

489
00:12:57,966 --> 00:12:58,800
FRESH GROUND TURKEY?

490
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:01,033
THE ONLY GROUND TURKEY THAT'S

491
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,866
93% LEAN AND 100% FUCKABLE.

492
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:05,100
GET YOUR FUCK FILL

493
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,866
WITH HONEYSUCKLE.

494
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:09,300
NOW, CLEARLY, MAINTAINING

495
00:13:09,366 --> 00:13:10,666
JOURNALISTIC INDEPENDENCE

496
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:11,266
FROM ADVERTISERS IS CRITICALLY

497
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,266
IMPORTANT.

498
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,233
SO IMPORTANT, IN FACT, IT'S

499
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,800
FREQUENTLY REFERRED TO AS THE

500
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:17,133
"CHURCH-STATE WALL."

501
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,966
AND THE FCC HAS RULES REQUIRING

502
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:20,966
BROADCAST STATIONS TO ANNOUNCE

503
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,633
WHEN CONTENT HAS BEEN SPONSORED

504
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,533
OR PAID FOR IN ANY WAY.

505
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,466
UNFORTUNATELY, MANY LOCAL

506
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:27,709
STATIONS HAVE EITHER COMPLETELY

507
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:29,166
BROKEN THOSE RULES, OR VIOLATED

508
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:30,333
THE SPIRIT OF THEM, THROUGH

509
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,133
A PRACTICE KNOWN AS

510
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,200
"SPONSORED CONTENT."

511
00:13:33,266 --> 00:13:34,266
IT'S WHERE ADVERTISING IS

512
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,866
BLENDED DIRECTLY INTO THE

513
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:37,333
BROADCASTS, AND IT'S BOTH

514
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,600
MORE WIDESPREAD, AND HARDER TO

515
00:13:38,633 --> 00:13:40,166
DETECT, THAN YOU MIGHT REALIZE.

516
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:42,600
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

517
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:43,800
SPONSORED CONTENT.

518
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,400
AND LET'S START WITH THE STUFF

519
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:47,200
THAT SEEMS ESSENTIALLY HARMLESS:

520
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:48,133
PEOPLE GETTING PAID TO HAWK

521
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,500
PRODUCTS ON TV.

522
00:13:50,566 --> 00:13:51,933
THERE'S AN INDUSTRY OF LIFESTYLE

523
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,066
EXPERTS THAT DO THIS.

524
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:56,209
HERE IS ONE OF THEM EXPLAINING

525
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:56,700
THE PROCESS TO POTENTIAL

526
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:57,066
CLIENTS.

527
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:58,866
BRANDIGRATION IS WHERE A

528
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:00,266
BRAND, ITS PRODUCT, AND THE

529
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,133
MESSAGING ARE ALL WORKED

530
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,900
TOGETHER WITHIN THE CONTENT OF

531
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:05,133
A SHOW IN A PRE-PLANNED MANNER.

532
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
WITH SO MANY SHOWS OFFERING

533
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:07,733
INTEGRATED CONTENT, IT CAN

534
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,633
BE HARD TO CHOOSE.

535
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,966
BUT LET'S START WITH LOCAL,

536
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:11,266
OKAY?

537
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,966
WE HAVE A METHOD THAT HELPS

538
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:14,666
ME GET INTERVIEWS IN A SNAP.

539
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:15,266
HI, MICHELLE!

SEE?

544
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:24,300
IN AN INSTANT, WE HAVE ACCESS

545
00:14:24,366 --> 00:14:25,376
TO SHOWS ACROSS THE NATION

546
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,266
THAT ARE READY FOR YOUR

547
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:27,500

548
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:28,233
WOW.

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,200
I GOTTA SAY, THAT IS PRETTY

550
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:30,833
IMPRESSIVE.

551
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,500
THE ONLY PERSON I CAN SUMMON

552
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:33,333
WITH A SNAP OF MY FINGERS IS

553
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,866
GEORGE CLOONEY.

554
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:38,466
WATCH.

555
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:39,100
THERE HE IS.

556
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:39,533
HELLO?

557
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,133
HEY, GEORGE!

558
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,300

00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,466
SIMPLE SNAP OF MY FINGERS.

565
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:56,033
I'M EATING DINNER.

566
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:01,000
I GAVE YOU THIS POWER TO USE IN

567
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:01,866
A LIMITED CAPACITY, JOHN.

568
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:02,433
UNDERSTOOD, GEORGE.

569
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,300
BYE!

570
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:04,100
BYE.

571
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,166
SEE?

572
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:06,366
THE SYSTEM WORKS!

573
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:07,633
BUT THE TRUTH IS, MICHELLE

574
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,600
DIDN'T JUST HAVE THE POWER

575
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,166
TO MAKE PEOPLE APPEAR OUT OF

576
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:09,533
THIN AIR.

577
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,766
SHE ALSO, CRUCIALLY, HAD THE

578
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:11,733
POWER TO MAKE THEM PLAY ALONG

579
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,533
AS SHE HAWKED HORRIFYING

580
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,733
PRODUCTS LIKE THESE.

581
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,566
THESE ARE THE NEW FRENCH'S

582
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:18,600
CRISPY JALAPENOS.

583
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:19,786
ONE FUN IDEA IS TO USE IT IN

584
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,466
THIS JALAPENO CHEESEBURGER DIP.

585
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:24,166
THIS IS SERIOUSLY EVERYTHING

586
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:24,833
YOU LOVE ABOUT A CHEESEBURGER

587
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:29,466
IN DIP FORM.

588
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:30,573
TAKE A LOOK, IS THIS THING

589
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:30,933
GORGEOUS OR WHAT?

590
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,433
THIS THING HAS JUST HIT

591
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:31,833
THE PARTY SCENE.

592
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,700
IT'S THE VELVETTA SHELLS AND

593
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:33,533
CHEESE LIFE SIZE LIQUID GOLD

594
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,866
FOUNTAIN.

595
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:37,500
OKAY, SO, A FEW THINGS I LOVE

596
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:38,766
ARE DORITOS, MELTED CHEESE

597
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,700
STICKS, AND NACHOS, AND NOW

598
00:15:40,766 --> 00:15:42,009
THERE'S A WAY YOU CAN ENJOY THEM

599
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:43,233
ALL IN ONE.

600
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,100
THESE ARE DORITOS LOADED.

601
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,166
IT IS A TOTALLY NEW WAY

602
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,233
TO EXPERIENCE DORITOS.

603
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:48,900
THAT'S A REALLY FUN TWIST

604
00:15:48,966 --> 00:15:49,566
ON A SNACK IDEA.

605
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:51,200
ISN'T IT?

606
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:52,666
NO!

607
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:54,000
NO, IT ISN'T!

608
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:54,833
NOW THAT PRODUCT HAS SINCE BEEN

609
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,433
DISCONTINUED.

610
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,433
PROBABLY BECAUSE IT LOOKS LESS

611
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,333
LIKE A SNACK, AND MORE LIKE

612
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,476
SOMEONE DEEP-FRIED A FIDGET

613
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,933
SPINNER.

614
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,633
AND YOU PROBABLY ASSUMED

615
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,000
MICHELLE WAS GETTING PAID

616
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:04,100
TO DO THAT.

617
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,600
BUT INTERESTINGLY, THE STATION

618
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,033
WAS ALSO GETTING PAID TO HAVE

619
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,766
HER ON.

620
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:12,133
AND WHILE THE FCC REQUIRES

621
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,700
SPONSORED CONTENT LIKE THAT

622
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:13,433
TO BE LABELED, IT HAS NO

623
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,900
REQUIREMENTS FOR EXACTLY HOW

624
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:16,500
OR FOR HOW LONG.

625
00:16:16,566 --> 00:16:18,866
SO FOR INSTANCE, IN THE CASE OF

626
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:19,666
DORITOS LOADED, THE DISCLOSURE

627
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:27,233
CAME AT THE VERY END OF THE

628
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,666
SEGMENT FOR JUST TWO SECONDS.

629
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:32,300
SO SIX SECONDS TOTAL.

630
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,200
WHICH IS, INCIDENTALLY, ABOUT

631
00:16:33,266 --> 00:16:33,966
THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME DORITOS

632
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:34,833
LOADED STAY IN YOUR BODY BEFORE

633
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,633
BEING FORCIBLY EJECTED FROM

634
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,133
WHATEVER ORIFICE THEY'RE

635
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,933
CLOSEST TO.

636
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,966
THIS PRACTICE CAN BE SO

637
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:40,566
LUCRATIVE THAT MANY BIG CHAINS

638
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,466
HAVE NOW SET UP TEMPLATES FOR

639
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:47,633
LOCAL SHOWS, BUILT AROUND

640
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,400
SPONSORED CONTENT.

641
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,666
SCRIPPS HAS "MORNING BLEND,"

642
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:51,400
TEGNA HAS "GREAT DAY," NEXSTAR

643
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:53,566
HAS "DAYTIME," AND SINCLAIR HAS,

644
00:16:53,633 --> 00:16:54,400
I CAN ONLY ASSUME, "THE MUSLIMS

645
00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:57,000
ATTACK AT DAWN."

646
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:58,700
AND IT'S NOT JUST BRAND EXPERTS

647
00:16:58,766 --> 00:17:00,166
JOINING BY SATELLITE.

648
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:02,633
SOMETIMES LOCAL BUSINESSES WILL

649
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,200
PAY FOR AN INTERVIEW, WHERE THEY

650
00:17:04,266 --> 00:17:05,533
CAN SCRIPT THE QUESTIONS, AND

651
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,100
MAKE SURE THEY'RE PRESENTED

652
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,900
GLOWINGLY.

653
00:17:07,966 --> 00:17:08,300
TAKE JIM HEAFNER.

654
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:09,533

WELCOME BACK, MR. HEAFNER!

00:17:40,466 --> 00:17:41,000

00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:41,266
US, SIR.

680
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,266
THIS MAN KNOWS HIS STUFF.

681
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,800
THAT LEVEL OF

682
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:48,600
ENTHUSIASTIC COSIGNING SEEMS

683
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:49,300
PRETTY CONVINCING UNTIL YOU

684
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:50,476
REMIND YOURSELF, THE STATION

685
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,576
WAS BEING PAID TO SAY THOSE

686
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,366
THINGS ABOUT HIM.

687
00:17:52,433 --> 00:17:54,600
IT'S THE REASON NO ONE WHO GETS

688
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,333
A BIRTHDAY CAMEO FROM GARY BUSEY

689
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,200
THINKS, "WOW, GARY BUSEY HOPES

690
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:00,276
I MAKE IT TO 156 YEARS OLD?

691
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,666
HE MUST BE MY BEST FRIEND."

692
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:04,500
INSTEAD, THEY THINK, "WOW, CRAIG

693
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:06,200
JUST WASTED $350 GETTING

694
00:18:06,266 --> 00:18:07,600
GARY BUSEY TO WISH ME

695
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,066
A HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

696
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:11,000
HE MUST BE MY BEST FRIEND."

697
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:12,700
AND IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT

698
00:18:12,766 --> 00:18:17,700
HEAFNER AND THE FIRM HE WORKED

699
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:20,566
NOT ONLY WERE ORDERED TO PLAY

700
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:21,642
$1 MILLION IN AN ARBITRATION

701
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,000
CASE THAT HE LOST RETIREES'

702
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:25,966
MONEY COME ABOUT 22 CLAYTON'S

703
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:26,200
RECENTLY

704
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:26,766
SEEKING DAMAGES RELATED TO

705
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:27,033
SUED HIM,

706
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,600
THE LOSS OF $2.7 MILLION OF

707
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:28,266
THEIR INVESTMENTS, WITH ONE OF

708
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,000
THEM EVEN SAYING HE TRUSTED

709
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,142
HEAFNER BECAUSE HE "BELIEVED

710
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,333
THE LONGEST-RUNNING CHARLOTTE

711
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,033
STATION WOULD INVITE ON

712
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,766
TRUSTED EXPERTS."

713
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:33,966
AND YEAH!

714
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:35,566
OF COURSE YOU'D BELIEVE THAT!

715
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:36,333
PEOPLE TRUST THEIR

716
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,266
LOCAL STATION!

717
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,100
THAT'S THE POINT HERE!

718
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,500
AND IT DOESN'T STOP AT THESE

719
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:45,100
LOCAL LIFESTYLE SHOWS...

720
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,176

THE REPORTS WERE SUSPICIOUSLY

736
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,433
UPBEAT.

737
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,540
THIS COMPLEX MACHINE IS

738

ERADICATING CANCER WITHOUT

00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,076
IS MARK KOBEL ACTUALLY REPORTING

753
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,600
THERE?

754
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:37,842
BECAUSE, IN RETROSPECT, IT SEEMS

755
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:39,366
MORE LIKE MARK KOBEL PARROTING

756
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:40,633
THE ABSURDLY SUNNY CANCER

757
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,200
PROPAGANDA OF HIS BUSINESS

758
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:47,300
DADDY'S FAVORITE MONEY FRIEND.

759
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:48,266
BUT I WILL SAY THIS, AT LEAST

760
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:48,800
THAT'S AN INSTANCE OF

761
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:49,733
A BROADCASTER ACTING SO

762
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,633
EGREGIOUSLY, THE FCC WAS ABLE

763
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,066
TO TAKE ACTION.

764
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:54,266
A LOT OF THE TIME, STATIONS ARE

765
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,166
DOING JUST ENOUGH DISCLOSURE

766
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:57,600
TO STAY THE RIGHT SIDE OF

767
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,366
THE FCC, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

768
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:00,233
THEY'RE NOT DOING MASSIVE HARM

769
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,566
TO THEIR CREDIBILITY.

770
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,533
BECAUSE EVEN WHEN A SPONSORSHIP

771
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,633
IS PROPERLY DISCLOSED, I'D ARGUE

772
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,266
THERE ARE CERTAIN BUSINESSES

773
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,000
LOCAL STATIONS SHOULD NOT BE

774
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:11,333
SELLING THEMSELVES OUT FOR.

775
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,233
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

776
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,566
MEDICINE.

777
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:15,533
BECAUSE A SURPRISING NUMBER

778
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,366
OF SEGMENTS ON THESE SHOWS ARE

779
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:18,533
ENTHUSIASTIC, UNCRITICAL

780
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,266
SHOWCASES FOR EXPENSIVE

781
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,533
TREATMENTS OR DEVICES,

782
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,333
FEATURING CLAIMS THAT ARE,

783
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,333
TO PUT IT CHARITABLY,

784
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,633
MEDICALLY DUBIOUS.

785
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,233
LIKE THIS PRODUCT,

786
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,433
WHICH MADE IT ONTO A REGULAR

787
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,666
MORNING NEWSCAST IN UTAH.

788
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:30,100
TODAY, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

789
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,033
A TECHNOLOGY AIMED TO HELP MEN

790
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,033
WITH A SERIOUS ISSUE.

791
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,300
STEPHANIE AND DUSTIN WOLFF,

792
00:20:35,366 --> 00:20:36,666
THE CO-INVENTORS OF THE WORLD'S

793
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:40,666
FIRST CLINICALLY TESTED HOME USE

794
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:43,166
SHOCK WAVE DEVICE TO TREAT

795
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:43,900
ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION.

796
00:20:43,966 --> 00:20:44,400
IT'S CALLED THE ROCKET.

797
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:45,400
THIS IS THE ROCKET.

798
00:20:45,466 --> 00:20:46,566
SO THE ROCKET WORKS ON THE

799
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:47,966
PRINCIPLE OF LOW-INTENSITY

800
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:49,142
SOUND WAVE THERAPY, WHICH HAS

801
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,342
ACTUALLY BEEN AROUND IN EUROPE

802
00:20:50,366 --> 00:20:51,700
FOR ABOUT 25 YEARS.

803
00:20:51,766 --> 00:20:52,900
IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE.

804
00:20:52,966 --> 00:20:54,900
IT'S SAFE.

805
00:20:54,966 --> 00:20:55,833
AND IT'S... THE TECHNOLOGY'S

806
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,266
FDA RECOGNIZED.

807
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,066
OKAY, FIRST, THAT

808
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,333
VIBRATING TAINT MISSILE LOOKS

809
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,300
UTTERLY TERRIFYING.

810
00:21:03,366 --> 00:21:04,166
AND WHILE IT'S SINCE BEEN

811
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:05,766
REBRANDED FROM "THE ROCKET" TO

812
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,200
"THE PHOENIX," I'M NOT SURE "PUT

813
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,600
THIS BIRD THAT DESTROYS ITSELF

814
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,266
IN FIRE NEAR YOUR PENIS" IS MUCH

815
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,733
OF AN UPGRADE.

816
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
WHAT DOES

817
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:17,000
"FDA RECOGNIZED" EVEN MEAN?

818
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:18,566
IT DEFINITELY DOESN'T MEAN IT'S

819
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:19,066
"FDA CLEARED," MUCH LESS

820
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:20,966
"APPROVED."

821
00:21:21,033 --> 00:21:23,566
AND THE FDA TOLD US THE PHOENIX

822
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:24,800
IS "REGISTERED" WITH THEM,

823
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,200
AS A THERAPEUTIC MASSAGER,

824
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:27,800
THOUGH, NOT AS A DEVICE TO TREAT

825
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:29,433
ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION.

826
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,300
AND AT THIS POINT, I LEGALLY

827
00:21:31,366 --> 00:21:32,500
HAVE TO TELL YOU,

828
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:34,066
THE MANUFACTURER OF THE PHOENIX

829
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:36,833
SAYS THEY MAKE NO EXPLICIT

830
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,166
CLAIMS ABOUT TREATING E.D.

831
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:41,966
WHICH IS A LITTLE ODD, BECAUSE

832
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:44,433
THEIR OWN WEBSITE CLAIMS THAT

833
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,766
PHOENIX OFFERS PROVEN TECHNOLOGY

834
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:47,466
TO MAKE YOUR

835
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:50,100
PENIS HARDER," WHICH THEY

836
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:53,333
AND YOU CAN COMPLETE THIS

837
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,300
TREATMENT IN YOUR HOME.

838
00:21:55,366 --> 00:21:55,566
WHICH THEY

839
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:58,433
PRESUMABLY FEEL JUSTIFIES

840
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,100
ITS PRICE TAG OF HOLY SHIT $879.

841
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:02,900
BUT THAT IS NOT THE POINT HERE.

842
00:22:02,966 --> 00:22:04,009
THE POINT IS, IF YOU'RE GOING TO

843
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:04,600
ALLOW THAT PRODUCT INTO THE BODY

844
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,200
OF YOUR LOCAL NEWSCAST,

845
00:22:06,266 --> 00:22:07,000
YOU MIGHT WANT TO HAVE SOME VERY

846
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:07,666
POINTED QUESTIONS READY, AND NOT

847
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:08,533
END THE SEGMENT LIKE THIS.

848
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,609
AND OF COURSE IF YOU WANT TO

849
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:10,400
FIND MORE INFORMATION, WHERE CAN

850
00:22:10,466 --> 00:22:11,233
THEY FIND IT ONLINE, GUYS?

851
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:11,633
THEY CAN GO TO

852
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,066
GetMyRocket.com.

853
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:14,000
THERE YOU GO.

854
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,266
GET THAT HELP YOU NEED FOR

855
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,100
WHATEVER AILMENT YOU'VE GOT

856
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:16,433
RIGHT HERE.

857
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,800
YEAH!

858
00:22:17,866 --> 00:22:18,700
USE THE ROCKET FOR WHATEVER

859
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:19,866
AILMENT YOU'VE GOT!

860
00:22:19,933 --> 00:22:22,066
ESPECIALLY IF THAT AILMENT IS

861
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:26,100
HAVING 879 TOO MANY DOLLARS.

862
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,000
AND THE THING IS, THAT'S FAR

863
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:28,866
FROM THE ONLY WEIRD MEDICAL

864
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:30,300
PRODUCT THAT'S BEEN PRESENTED

865
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:31,409
UNCRITICALLY DURING SPONSORED

866
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,800
SEGMENTS.

867
00:22:32,866 --> 00:22:34,700
DENVER'S MILE-HIGH LIVING

868
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:35,776
FEATURED A SPA OWNER PROMOTING

869
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,866
THIS EXCITING NEW TREATMENT:

870
00:22:37,933 --> 00:22:39,633
MONA LISA TOUCH IS THE FIRST

871
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,533
FDA-CLEARED LASER TO TREAT

872
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,866
THE VAGINA, AND IN DOING SO,

873
00:22:41,933 --> 00:22:42,466
IT TREATS THE SYMPTOMS OF

874
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:43,800
VAGINAL ATROPHY.

875
00:22:43,866 --> 00:22:44,500
SO THE PROCEDURE ITSELF,

876
00:22:44,566 --> 00:22:45,866
IS IT PAINFUL?

877
00:22:45,933 --> 00:22:47,833
NO.

878
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,466
IT'S... TYPICALLY, WHAT YOU'LL

879
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,866
FEEL ARE MILD VIBRATIONS.

880
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:50,866
I TEASE, THE NEXT DAY YOU MIGHT

881
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:52,266
FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE A SUNBURNED

882
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:54,466
VAGINA, BUT IT'S JUST HEALING.

883
00:22:54,533 --> 00:22:55,433
OH, THAT'S OKAY, THEN.

884
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,700
IT'S JUST YOUR TYPICAL,

885
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:58,300
EVERYDAY, SUNBURNED VAGINA.

886
00:22:58,366 --> 00:22:59,966
AND ONLY CAUSED BY A LASER.

887
00:23:00,033 --> 00:23:00,633
SO REALLY, JUST YOUR TYPICAL,

888
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,800
EVERYDAY, LASER-ROASTED

889
00:23:01,866 --> 00:23:03,333
GENITALIA.

890
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,666
WHICH IS JUST HEALING.

891
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:05,366
FROM THE LASER YOU DELIBERATELY

892
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:07,033
BURNED IT WITH.

893
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,000
IT BEING THE INSIDE

894
00:23:08,066 --> 00:23:08,766
OF YOUR VAGINA.

895
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:09,966
YOUR RUN-OF-THE-MILL

896
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:12,633
LASER-CHARRED VAGINA.

897
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,400
AND IF USING A LASER AS A

898
00:23:14,466 --> 00:23:16,766
MEDICAL PSEUDO-DILDO SEEMS LIKE

899
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:17,633
YOU HAVE

900
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,766
GOOD INSTINCTS.

901
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,066
BECAUSE OVER A YEAR BEFORE THAT

902
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,666
SEGMENT AIRED, THE FDA ISSUED A

903
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:24,633
SAFETY ALERT, MAKING IT CLEAR

904
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,033
THAT THEY HAVE NOT CLEARED OR

905
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:30,100
APPROVED FOR MARKETING ANY

906
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:30,700
ENERGY-BASED DEVICES TO TREAT

907
00:23:30,766 --> 00:23:31,926
VAGINAL ATROPHY, AND APPLYING

908
00:23:31,966 --> 00:23:33,166
ENERGY-BASED THERAPIES TO

909
00:23:33,233 --> 00:23:34,309
THE VAGINA MAY LEAD TO VAGINAL

910
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:35,509
BURNS, SCARRING, AND RECURRING

911
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:37,566
OR CHRONIC PAIN.

912
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:39,133
AND THE PROBLEM IS, SEGMENTS

913
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,433
WITH DICEY MEDICAL CLAIMS ARE

914
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,033
JUST EVERYWHERE.

915
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,209
RECENTLY, THE FDA HAS WARNED

916
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:45,433
ABOUT THE USE OF UNAPPROVED

917
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,600
STEM CELL THERAPIES,

918
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,333
WHICH THEY SAY CAN BE HARMFUL.

919
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,866
BUT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THAT

920
00:23:49,933 --> 00:23:52,900
TO WATCH SOME OF THESE SHOWS.

921
00:23:52,966 --> 00:23:54,166
HERE'S A SEGMENT FROM

922
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:55,533
"GOOD MORNING TEXAS," FEATURING

923
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,609
A DOCTOR WHO'S BEEN DISCIPLINED

924
00:23:56,633 --> 00:23:57,733
MULTIPLE TIMES BY THE STATE

925
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,033
MEDICAL BOARD FOR SEPARATE

926
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,833
ISSUES, CLAIMING HIS STEM CELL

927
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,900
THERAPY CAN TREAT THINGS LIKE

928
00:24:02,966 --> 00:24:04,600
M.S. AND PARKINSON'S, DESPITE

929
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:08,033
THE FACT THAT STEM CELLS HAVE

930
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,666
NEVER BEEN APPROVED TO TREAT ANY

931
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:10,133
NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER.

932
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,309
AND IT'S NOT JUST HIM... HERE'S

933
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:13,033
A NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR, MAKING

934
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:13,733
SIMILARLY BASELESS CLAIMS ON A

935
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,700
STATION IN ARIZONA.

936
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:16,366
SO, WHAT KIND OF CONDITIONS

937
00:24:16,433 --> 00:24:17,800
ARE YOU TREATING WITH THIS?

938
00:24:17,866 --> 00:24:19,000
SO, WE TREAT SO MANY

939
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:21,133
DIFFERENT KINDS OF CONDITIONS.

940
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,833
WE CAN DO IT TO JOINTS,

941
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,166
WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF

942
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:26,133
THAT... SYSTEMIC THINGS AS WELL.

943
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,433
INCLUDING, WE'VE HAD A PATIENT

944
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,542
WITH CHRON'S DISEASE RECENTLY.

945
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:30,300
HAD A PATIENT WITH HEART DISEASE

946
00:24:30,366 --> 00:24:30,800
WHO WAS IN SEVERE HEART

947
00:24:30,866 --> 00:24:31,966
FAILURE.

948
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:32,966
BOTH OF THEM WITHIN A WEEK OF

949
00:24:33,033 --> 00:24:34,933
GETTING THESE STEM CELLS ARE

950
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,240
JUST FEELING GREAT AND IMPROVED

951
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:36,733
TO ALMOST NORMAL.

952
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,666
WOW!

953
00:24:38,733 --> 00:24:42,533
YEAH, WOW!

954
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:42,900
INDEED!

955
00:24:42,966 --> 00:24:44,042
THAT CARD SUGGESTED HE CAN TREAT

956
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,333
PARKINSONS, ALZHEIMERS, AUTISM,

957
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,533
M.S. AND ALS.

958
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,766
IT SEEMS THE ONLY THING HIS

959
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,400
STEM CELLS CAN'T DO IS HELP THAT

960
00:24:50,466 --> 00:24:52,300
STATION PROOFREAD THEIR LIST OF

961
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:53,133
"CONDITIONS CAN STEM CELL

962
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,033
THERAPY BENEFIT."

963
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,933
BECAUSE OTHER THAN THAT,

964
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,366
GOT YOU THEY COVERED HAVE!

965
00:24:58,433 --> 00:24:59,509
AND LOOK, WHILE THERE IS NO WAY

966
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:00,400
OF KNOWING EXACTLY HOW MANY

967
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:01,833
PEOPLE ARE WATCHING THESE SHOWS

968
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,500
AS THEY AIR, THAT'S NOT REALLY

969
00:25:04,566 --> 00:25:06,000
THE POINT, AS THIS MARKETING

970
00:25:06,066 --> 00:25:07,109
EXECUTIVE AT NEXSTAR EXPLAINED

971
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:08,733
TO POTENTIAL ADVERTISERS.

972
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,166
NOW, HERE'S THE DEAL.

973
00:25:10,233 --> 00:25:11,833
MOST PEOPLE THINK, "OKAY, SO I

974
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,400
GO ON THE TV SHOW, I'M ON TV,

975
00:25:13,466 --> 00:25:14,900
GREAT, THIS IS AWESOME, AND IT

976
00:25:14,966 --> 00:25:15,733
AIRS AT 4:00, I GO ON, GREAT,

977
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,066
AND PEOPLE SEE ME, OKAY,

978
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:22,333
SO THIS IS COOL."

979
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,800
I'M GONNA TELL YOU RIGHT NOW,

980
00:25:23,866 --> 00:25:25,333
WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GO ON AND DO

981
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,500
THAT, THAT ISN'T EVEN THE CAKE.

982
00:25:27,566 --> 00:25:29,133
THAT'S JUST THE ICING.

983
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,500
YOU KNOW WHAT THE CAKE IS?

984
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:35,900
THE VIDEO FILE.

985
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,376
AT THE END, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A

986
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,640
FOUR OR FIVE MINUTE VIDEO FILE.

987
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,233
AND YOU'RE GONNA DO WHAT WITH

988
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:39,400
IT?

989
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:42,333
POST IT EVERYWHERE!

990
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:44,833
WHAT IS THAT MOTION?

991
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,600
THAT IS UNNECESSARILY GROSS.

992
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:48,466
THIS ISN'T HOW YOU REPRESENT

993
00:25:48,533 --> 00:25:50,266
CAKE AND ICING.

994
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:51,233
THIS IS HOW YOU BRING A

995
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,666
MASH'S HAM TO ORGASM.

996
00:25:52,733 --> 00:25:54,933
YOU GIVE IT THE OL' WIGGLE AND

997
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,533
SQUEEZE, AND THEN A TWIST AND

998
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,066
A SNAP.

999
00:25:56,133 --> 00:25:57,200
OH, SHIT!

1000
00:25:57,266 --> 00:25:59,533
WHAT IS IT?

1001
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,166
SORRY, GEORGE.

1002
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:04,300
I'M SORRY.

1003
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:04,833
THAT ONE WAS GENUINELY AN

1004
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,233
ACCIDENT.

1005
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,100
I WAS JUST TRYING TO SHOW PEOPLE

1006
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:06,966
HOW TO BRING A MASH'S HAM TO

1007
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:07,200
ORGASM.

1008
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:10,800
THAT'S NOT HOW YOU DO IT.

1009
00:26:10,866 --> 00:26:14,533
OH.

1010
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,166
I GUESS THAT'S GOOD INFORMATION

1011
00:26:15,233 --> 00:26:15,700
TO HAVE.

1012
00:26:15,766 --> 00:26:16,333
THE POINT IS, THAT MARKETING

1013
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,400
EXECUTIVE IS RIGHT.

1014
00:26:17,433 --> 00:26:18,533
THE CAKE IS THE VIDEO FILE,

1015
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,400
AND COMPANIES WILL TAKE THAT

1016
00:26:19,466 --> 00:26:20,566
VIDEO AND RUN WITH IT.

1017
00:26:20,633 --> 00:26:21,673
REMEMBER THAT NATUROPATHIC

1018
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,566
DOCTOR WHO CLAIMED STEM CELLS

1019
00:26:22,633 --> 00:26:23,200
ARE A TREATMENT FOR ALZHEIMER'S

1020
00:26:23,266 --> 00:26:25,533
AND AUTISM?

1021
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,300
HERE'S HIS WEBSITE, WHICH

1022
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:28,576
PROUDLY FEATURES THE MANY TIMES

1023
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,533
HE WAS GIVEN AN UNCRITICAL

1024
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,533
PLATFORM ON TRUSTED LOCAL TV.

1025
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,100
AND YOU MIGHT THINK VIEWERS

1026
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:36,166
SHOULD BE SMART ENOUGH TO

1027
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:37,066
APPROACH ANYTHING ON THESE SHOWS

1028
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:41,266
WITH SKEPTICISM.

1029
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:46,766
THE THING IS, THOUGH, MANY OF

1030
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:47,400
THESE STATIONS ALSO SWAP FIGURES

1031
00:26:47,466 --> 00:26:48,166
FROM THEIR NEWSROOM TO THEIR

1032
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:49,000
SPONSORED CONTENT SHOWS.

1033
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,200
AT ABC4 UTAH, FOR INSTANCE,

1034
00:26:51,266 --> 00:26:51,700
SURAE CHINN IS BOTH THE

1035
00:26:51,766 --> 00:26:52,200
CHANNEL'S CHIEF MEDICAL

1036
00:26:52,266 --> 00:26:53,342
CORRESPONDENT AND A HOST OF

1037
00:26:53,366 --> 00:26:54,433
THE SPONSORED CONTENT SHOW

1038
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,733
"GOOD THINGS UTAH."

1039
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,000
AND IT REALLY DOES FEEL LIKE A

1040
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,200
LINE IS GETTING BLURRED THERE.

1041
00:27:00,266 --> 00:27:02,433
AND LOOK, IDEALLY, STATIONS

1042
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,576
WOULDN'T ENGAGE IN THIS PRACTICE

1043
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,466
AT ALL... OR, AT THE VERY LEAST,

1044
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:06,166
THEIR DISCLOSURES WOULD BE

1045
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:07,166
HARDER FOR VIEWERS TO MISS,

1046
00:27:07,233 --> 00:27:08,500
AND THEY'D DO SIGNIFICANTLY

1047
00:27:08,566 --> 00:27:10,166
MORE WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT

1048
00:27:10,233 --> 00:27:12,266
IF THEY'RE LETTING SOMEONE BUY

1049
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,000
THEIR WAY ONTO THEIR CHANNEL,

1050
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,400
AND PRESENT SOMETHING AS REAL,

1051
00:27:15,466 --> 00:27:16,400
THAT IT'S NOT, IN FACT, TOTAL

1052
00:27:16,466 --> 00:27:17,500
NONSENSE.

1053
00:27:17,566 --> 00:27:19,033
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, IT'S FAR TOO

1054
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,900
EASY TO MAKE A RIDICULOUS

1055
00:27:20,966 --> 00:27:21,800
PRODUCT THAT MAKES OUTLANDISH

1056
00:27:21,866 --> 00:27:23,066
CLAIMS, AND GET IT ONTO

1057
00:27:23,133 --> 00:27:25,066
LOCAL TV.

1058
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:26,966
AND THE REASON I KNOW THAT IS,

1059
00:27:27,033 --> 00:27:28,300
WE DID.

1060
00:27:28,366 --> 00:27:29,966
WE STARTED A COMPANY CALLED

1061
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:31,466
VENUS INVENTIONS, AND CREATED

1062
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:33,666
SOMETHING CALLED THE VENUS VEIL.

1063
00:27:33,733 --> 00:27:35,333
AN ABSURD MEDICAL PRODUCT BASED

1064
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,509
ON TECHNOLOGY THAT ABSOLUTELY

1065
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:39,433
DOES NOT EXIST.

1066
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,266
WE SET UP THIS WEBSITE, AND EVEN

1067
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:43,233
HIRED AN ACTRESS TO BRANDIGRATE

1068
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,540
THE SHIT OUT OF THE VENUS VEIL,

1069
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,133
INTO SHOWS IT HAD NO BUSINESS

1070
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,333
BEING ON.

1071
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,166
DID IT WORK?

1072
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:50,533
I DUNNO... YOU TELL ME,

1073
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,966
ABC 4 UTAH!

1074
00:27:53,033 --> 00:27:54,800
I'M SO EXCITED TO TALK WITH

1075
00:27:54,866 --> 00:27:56,666
ERICA HERNANDEZ WITH

1076
00:27:56,733 --> 00:27:59,633
THE VENUS VEIL, A REVOLUTIONARY

1077
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,400
NEW PRODUCT ON THE LINE.

1078
00:28:00,466 --> 00:28:01,466
WHAT EXACTLY IS IT?

1079
00:28:01,533 --> 00:28:03,566
I'M SO INTRIGUED.

1080
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:04,100
I'M SO GLAD YOU ARE

1081
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:05,200
INTRIGUED.

1082
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,366
SO THIS IS THE VENUS VEIL.

1083
00:28:07,433 --> 00:28:08,200
IT IS THE WORLD'S FIRST

1084
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:10,200
SEXUAL HEALTH BLANKET.

1085
00:28:10,266 --> 00:28:12,100
YEP!

1086
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:14,033
THAT WAS ON ABC 4 LAST FRIDAY.

1087
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,666
AND I'D LOVE TO TELL YOU IT WAS

1088
00:28:15,733 --> 00:28:16,909
DIFFICULT TO GET IT ON, BUT IT

1089
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:18,800
REALLY WASN'T.

1090
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:20,333
AND REMEMBER, THAT'S THEIR

1091
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,066
CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT.

1092
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:23,700
AND IT SEEMS STRIKING THAT

1093
00:28:23,766 --> 00:28:25,400
SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY FOLLOW-UPS

1094
00:28:25,466 --> 00:28:26,366
ON CLAIMS WE MADE ABOUT THE VEIL

1095
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:27,933
THAT YOU'D HOPE A MEDICAL

1096
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,009
CORRESPONDENT WOULD IMMEDIATELY

1097
00:28:29,033 --> 00:28:31,000
TAKE ISSUE WITH.

1098
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:32,300
THE VEIL IS BEING DESIGNED

1099
00:28:32,366 --> 00:28:34,333
WITH THE HOPE THAT IT WILL

1100
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,266
PRECISELY DRAW OUT THE NATURAL

1101
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:39,033
ALKALINE UNDERCURRENTS OF THE

1102
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,376
VAGINA, AND INITIATE A LOW-GRADE

1103
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,900
STATE OF WHAT WE CALL

1104
00:28:41,966 --> 00:28:43,933
MICRO-DEATH, WHICH SOUNDS

1105
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,733
INCREDIBLY SCARY, BUT THAT'S

1106
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,133
ACTUALLY JUST RESTARTING THAT

1107
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,433
AREA'S NATURAL LIFE CYCLE.

1108
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,266
IT'S USING THIS FIELD OF

1109
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:52,033
MAGNETO-GENETICS I WAS TALKING

1110
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,500
ABOUT, AND ALSO A TECHNOLOGY

1111
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:54,900
THAT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A REALLY

1112
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,206
LONG TIME THAT WAS PIONEERED IN

1113
00:28:56,266 --> 00:28:58,500
GERMANY ABOUT 80 YEARS AGO.

1114
00:28:58,566 --> 00:28:59,866
SO THIS IS FULL OF CUTTING-EDGE

1115
00:28:59,933 --> 00:29:00,466
TECHNOLOGY, BUT IT JUST LOOKS

1116
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:01,800
LIKE A BLANKET.

1117
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:05,566
YEAH!

1118
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:06,533
IT DOES.

1119
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS.

1120
00:29:07,633 --> 00:29:08,266
IT IS JUST A BLANKET.

1121
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:09,133
ALSO, TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS

1122
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,666
PIONEERED IN GERMANY ABOUT

1123
00:29:09,733 --> 00:29:10,833
80 YEARS AGO?

1124
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,166
I WOULD HAVE SOME QUESTIONS

1125
00:29:12,233 --> 00:29:13,353
ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR PERIOD

1126
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,900
IN GERMAN HISTORY.

1127
00:29:15,966 --> 00:29:17,133
AND I KNOW THAT LOOKS BAD.

1128
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,366
BUT LET'S BE FAIR HERE,

1129
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:20,600
IT'S JUST AN ISOLATED EXAMPLE.

1130
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:21,566
THERE WAS NO WAY ANOTHER STATION

1131
00:29:21,633 --> 00:29:22,133
WAS GOING TO FALL FOR THIS.

1132
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,133
RIGHT?

1133
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,966
ABSOLUTELY NO WAY.

1134
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:28,133
IS THERE, KVUE AUSTIN?

1135
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,242
BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE LET US

1136
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:30,766
PAY TO DIRECTLY FOLLOW YOUR

1137
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:31,766
10:00 PM LOCAL NEWS THIS

1138
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:33,333
THURSDAY, WOULD YOU?

1139
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,633
THERE'S NO WAY THAT HAPPENED.

1140
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,433
IT INCLUDES SOME PRETTY

1141
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,533
INTERESTING TECHNOLOGY.

1142
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,033
YES, IT DOES.

1143
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,300
SO THE TEAM BEHIND THE VEIL

1144
00:29:40,366 --> 00:29:41,100
WAS INSPIRED BY THE FIELD OF

1145
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:42,333
MAGNETO-GENETICS.

1146
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,900
BUT BASICALLY, YOUR BLOOD IS

1147
00:29:43,966 --> 00:29:45,366
FULL OF IRON, BUT IT'S DISPERSED

1148
00:29:45,433 --> 00:29:46,833
IN SUCH A WAY IT ISN'T AFFECTED

1149
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,266
BY NORMAL MAGNETS.

1150
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:49,533
SO THE IDEA BEHIND THE VEIL IS

1151
00:29:49,566 --> 00:29:51,333
WITH THE RIGHT BLEND OF

1152
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,633
PROPRIETARY MAGNETIC FIBERS,

1153
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,733
YOU CAN CREATE A SELF-CONTAINED

1154
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,900
MAGNETIC FIELD THAT RESTIMULATES

1155
00:29:56,966 --> 00:29:58,333
BLOOD FLOW AND GETS YOU FEELING

1156
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,333
LIKE YOUR NORMAL SELF AGAIN.

1157
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,766
VERY INTERESTING.

1158
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:02,133
IS IT?

1159
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,100
IS IT INTERESTING?

1160
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:05,276
OR IS THAT OBVIOUS BULLSHIT THAT

1161
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,409
DEFINITELY SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN

1162
00:30:06,433 --> 00:30:07,733
ON IN THE SAME HOUR

1163
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,233
AS COVERAGE OF THE CEASE-FIRE

1164
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,633
IN THE MIDDLE EAST,

1165
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,500
A SHORTAGE OF LIFEGUARDS IN

1166
00:30:11,566 --> 00:30:12,400
LOCAL PUBLIC POOLS, AND AN

1167
00:30:12,466 --> 00:30:13,466
INVESTIGATIVE PIECE

1168
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:14,700
ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND

1169
00:30:14,766 --> 00:30:15,666
BAIL REFORM?

1170
00:30:15,733 --> 00:30:17,566
ONE OF THESE THINGS IS NOT LIKE

1171
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:19,133
THE OTHERS, AND IT'S DEFINITELY

1172
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,266
OUR NAZI-ERA FUCK BLANKET.

1173
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:23,533
BUT SURELY, IF YOU SAW THIS

1174
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,600
BLANKET IN PERSON, THEN,

1175
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:28,033
IN A STUDIO,

1176
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,500
YOU WOULD KNOW NOT TO

1177
00:30:29,566 --> 00:30:31,033
ENTHUSIASTICALLY COSIGN ON

1178
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,666
THE COMPLETELY BASELESS CLAIMS

1179
00:30:31,733 --> 00:30:32,366
BEING MADE RIGHT IN FRONT

1180
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:33,700
OF YOU.

1181
00:30:33,766 --> 00:30:36,233
YOU'D PROTECT YOUR VIEWERS FROM

1182
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,066
THAT HAPPENING, WOULDN'T YOU,

1183
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:38,700
DENVER'S "MILE HIGH LIVING?"

1184
00:30:38,766 --> 00:30:41,166
THIS IS MEANT TO TREAT SEXUAL

1185
00:30:41,233 --> 00:30:42,442
CONDITIONS, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE

1186
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,133
ARE EMBARRASSED TO TALK ABOUT

1187
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,366
THEIR SEXUAL HEALTH, RIGHT?

1188
00:30:46,433 --> 00:30:47,266
SO IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE

1189
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:49,600
SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY DISCRETE

1190
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:52,400
AND ALSO REALLY STYLISH SO YOU

1191
00:30:52,466 --> 00:30:53,133
CAN HAVE IT IN YOUR HOME AND IT

1192
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,766
REALLY... I MEAN, COULD IT LOOK

1193
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:54,966
LESS LIKE A MEDICAL PRODUCT?

1194
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:55,533
YEAH, NO, IT DOESN'T LOOK

1195
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:55,933
LIKE THAT.

1196
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,933
YOU KNOW, AGAIN, IT'S ONE OF

1197
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,533
THOSE THINGS I THINK A LOT OF

1198
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,166
PEOPLE RIGHT NOW ARE LOOKING

1199
00:30:59,233 --> 00:30:59,666
TO ENHANCE THEIR LIVES,

1200
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:00,533
BUT THEY ALSO DON'T WANT

1201
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,466
ANYTHING TOO INVASIVE.

1202
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:02,866
RIGHT, YEAH.

1203
00:31:02,933 --> 00:31:03,976
SO THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE,

1204
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,500
AGAIN, YOU'RE NOT NEEDING A

1205
00:31:04,566 --> 00:31:05,166
PRESCRIPTION OR ANYTHING LIKE

1206
00:31:05,233 --> 00:31:05,700
THAT AS WELL.

1207
00:31:05,766 --> 00:31:06,766
YES.

1208
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:07,566
WELL, THANK YOU, ERICA.

1209
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:08,200
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING IN

1210
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:08,533
TODAY.

1211
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,400
WE APPRECIATE IT.

1212
00:31:09,466 --> 00:31:10,200
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING

1213
00:31:10,266 --> 00:31:10,600
ME.

1214
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:11,200
THANKS FOR MAKING IT SO EASY.

1215
00:31:11,266 --> 00:31:12,100
THIS WAS GREAT.

1216
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:12,600
YEAH, SUPER EASY.

1217
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:13,300
YEAH!

1218
00:31:13,366 --> 00:31:14,700
SUPER EASY!

1219
00:31:14,766 --> 00:31:16,266
YOU COULD EVEN ARGUE

1220
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,066
"WAY TOO EASY."

1221
00:31:18,133 --> 00:31:19,633
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, NONE OF

1222
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,742
THIS WAS NEARLY DIFFICULT ENOUGH

1223
00:31:20,766 --> 00:31:22,266
TO GET ONTO TV.

1224
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:26,333
AND IT WASN'T EVEN EXPENSIVE.

1225
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,366
THAT COST JUST $2800.

1226
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:30,966
THIS ONE COST $2650.

1227
00:31:31,033 --> 00:31:32,766
AND THIS ONE ONLY COST $1750.

1228
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:34,500
IT WAS ALL SHOCKINGLY

1229
00:31:34,566 --> 00:31:35,800
AFFORDABLE, AND SADLY, ON SOME

1230
00:31:35,866 --> 00:31:36,876
STATIONS, DIDN'T EVEN LOOK THAT

1231
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,533
OUT OF PLACE.

1232
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,533
AND THAT IS NOT GOOD.

1233
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,666
BECAUSE, AS WE'VE SAID FOR

1234
00:31:43,733 --> 00:31:44,466
YEARS NOW, THE INTEGRITY OF

1235
00:31:44,533 --> 00:31:45,566
LOCAL NEWS IS CRUCIALLY

1236
00:31:45,633 --> 00:31:48,466
IMPORTANT.

1237
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:49,200
AND THERE IS REAL HARM FOR

1238
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:50,100
EVERYONE IF THAT INTEGRITY

1239
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:51,400
IS DAMAGED.

1240
00:31:51,466 --> 00:31:53,000
SO TO THE OWNERS OF THESE

1241
00:31:53,066 --> 00:31:55,466
STATIONS WHO ARE SELLING THEM

1242
00:31:55,533 --> 00:31:56,400
OUT AT A DEPRESSINGLY CHEAP

1243
00:31:56,466 --> 00:31:58,766
PRICE, I HAVE A SIMPLE QUESTION.

1244
00:31:58,833 --> 00:31:59,433
IF I MAY QUOTE THE WORDS OF A

1245
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,666
VERY WISE NEWS ANCHOR:

1246
00:32:00,733 --> 00:32:03,066
THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?

1247
00:32:03,133 --> 00:32:04,333
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

1248
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,500
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

1249
00:32:06,566 --> 00:32:08,533
IF YOU WANT TO SEE OUR VENUS

1250
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,233
VEIL SEGMENTS IN FULL... THE

1251
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:10,966
WHOLE CAKE, IF YOU WILL... YOU

1252
00:32:11,033 --> 00:32:11,866
CAN GO TO Venuslnventions.com.

1253
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:15,166
GOOD NIGHT!

1254
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,400
ARE THERE ANY SIDE EFFECTS OF

1255
00:32:17,466 --> 00:32:17,900
THIS AT ALL?

1256
00:32:17,966 --> 00:32:19,766
YOU MIGHT FEEL A LITTLE BIT

1257
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:20,733
OF TINGLING BUT WE LIKEN IT TO

1258
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,033
WHAT YOU MIGHT FEEL IF YOU ARE

1259
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,900
STANDING OVER A REALLY LOUD
