1
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:28,915
HI THERE!

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,866
WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL

3
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:31,209
TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK VOID,

4
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:32,376
WHICH I'VE NOW BEEN IN SO LONG

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,800
I'M ABOUT TO HAVE TO GET IT

6
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:35,100
WAXED AND BLEACHED AGAIN.

7
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,866
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK, FROM A

8
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:37,942
CYBERATTACK FORCING THE SHUTDOWN

9
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:39,300
OF A TOP U.S. PIPELINE TO

10
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:40,542
VACCINATIONS CONTINUING TO ROLL

11
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:41,766
OUT, WITH CITIES AND STATES

12
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,913
INCENTIVIZING PEOPLE TO GET

13
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:44,166
THEM.

14
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:45,500
OHIO, FOR INSTANCE, IS OFFERING

15
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:46,933
A PRIZE OF UP TO $1 MILLION FOR

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,500
GETTING THE VACCINE, WHILE

17
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:51,066
NEW YORK CITY IS OFFERING FREE

18
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:52,966
SHAKE SHACK, WHICH OUR MAYOR

19
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:53,666
BILL de BLASIO TRIED TO SELL IN

20
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:54,733
THE LEAST APPETIZING WAY

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,166
IMAGINABLE.

22
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:57,666
JUST THINK OF THIS WHEN YOU

23
00:00:57,733 --> 00:01:00,400
THINK OF VACCINATION...

24
00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:01,666
MMM, VACCINATION...

25
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:04,133
MMM...

26
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,966
I'M GETTING A VERY GOOD

27
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,500
FEELING...

28
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:08,433
ABOUT VACCINATION RIGHT THIS

29
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,866
MOMENT.

30
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:16,300
NOPE.

31
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:17,100
THAT'S A NO, BILL.

32
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:17,600
NO TO EVERYTHING THERE.

33
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:18,833
NO TO THE UNCOMFORTABLY LOUD

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,166
CHEWING.

35
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:19,966
AND DEFINITELY NO TO THE "MMM."

36
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:20,666
YOU SOUND LIKE A SEXUALLY

37
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:21,266
FRUSTRATED COW TRYING AND

38
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,766
FAILING TO CLIMAX.

39
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:24,533
AND LOOK, I'D LOVE TO TALK FOR

40
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,166
THE REST OF THE SHOW ABOUT HOW

41
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:25,666
TERRIBLE IT IS TO WATCH

42
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:26,666
BILL de BLASIO EAT A BURGER.

43
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:29,166
BUT THE THING IS, I CAN'T.

44
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:30,309
INSTEAD... IF I MAY QUOTE THE

45
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,566
RISKIEST THING YOU COULD

46
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,133
POSSIBLY SAY ON A FIRST DATE...

47
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,800
"LET'S TALK ABOUT ISRAEL."

48
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:36,700
BECAUSE THE BIGGEST NEWS OF THE

49
00:01:36,766 --> 00:01:38,366
WEEK HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN THIS.

50
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:39,833
THIS MORNING, THE WORST

51
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,466
VIOLENCE IN YEARS BETWEEN

52
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:43,200
ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS IS

53
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:44,766
INTENSIFYING.

54
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:46,600
ISRAEL'S MILITARY ATTACKED NEW

55
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:47,909
TARGETS IN GAZA, THE PALESTINIAN

56
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:50,366
TERRITORY WHERE MILITANTS ARE

57
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:51,333
FIRING HUNDREDS OF ROCKETS INTO

58
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,400
ISRAEL.

59
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:53,666
AND IN THE ISRAELI-OCCUPIED

60
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:55,233
WEST BANK, PALESTINIAN

61
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,700
PROTESTERS FOUGHT WITH POLICE.

62
00:01:57,766 --> 00:01:59,066
SINCE MONDAY, OVER 80

63
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:00,633
PALESTINIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED

64
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,200
AND 7 ISRAELIS IN THIS

65
00:02:01,266 --> 00:02:06,533
TIT-FOR-TAT WAR.

66
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,533
OKAY, THERE IS A LOT TO

67
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,709
UNPACK THERE, FROM THE HORROR OF

68
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:09,200
THE SITUATION... WHICH HAS

69
00:02:09,266 --> 00:02:09,800
ESCALATED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE

70
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:10,666
THEN... TO THE USE OF THE PHRASE

71
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:11,942
"TIT-FOR-TAT WAR" IN A CONFLICT

72
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,600
WHERE YOU JUST POINTED OUT ONE

73
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,766
SIDE HAS SUFFERED OVER TEN TIMES

74
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,066
THE CASUALTIES, SOMETHING WHICH

75
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:21,366
IMBALANCE AT PLAY HERE AND HOW

76
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,066
THAT OFTEN GETS OBSCURED BY HOW

77
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:25,966
WE CHOOSE TO TALK ABOUT IT.

78
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:27,433
AND LOOK, IF YOU'RE NOT FLUENT

79
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,866
IN MIDDLE EAST HISTORY, I KNOW

80
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:29,942
THIS CAN SEEM OVERWHELMING...

81
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:31,166
THE LATEST CHAPTER IN A LONG

82
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:33,666
STORY YOU HAVEN'T READ.

83
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:34,866
SO I'M NOT GOING TO TRY AND

84
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:35,666
RECAP THE HISTORY HERE, OR

85
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:37,133
INDEED, PROPOSE A SOLUTION...

86
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,100
ALTHOUGH, INTERESTINGLY, I DO

87
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,000
HAVE ONE.

88
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:40,900
BECAUSE SOMEONE WITH THIS ACCENT

89
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:41,866
ALWAYS THINKS THEY CAN FIX

90
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:46,066
THINGS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

91
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:46,733
I REDREW THE MAP A BIT, AND I

92
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,433
HAVE A LOT OF MISPLACED

93
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,400
CONFIDENCE THAT IT WOULD WORK

94
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:49,733
VERY WELL.

95
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,133
BUT THIS WEEK'S ACTUALLY BEEN A

96
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,440
PRETTY GOOD REMINDER THAT WHILE

97
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,733
SOME THINGS ARE INCREDIBLY

98
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,366
COMPLEX AND REQUIRE A GREAT DEAL

99
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:57,033
OF CONTEXT, OTHERS ARE JUST

100
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,800
WRONG.

101
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:00,009
TAKE, FOR INSTANCE, ONE OF THE

102
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:00,866
INCIDENTS THAT'S BEEN A

103
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:01,800
FLASHPOINT...

104
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:02,733
THE PLANNED EXPULSION OF

105
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,200
PALESTINIANS WHO'VE LIVED IN THE

106
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:07,433
SHEIKH JARRAH NEIGHBORHOOD FOR

107
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,100
GENERATIONS.

108
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,333
IT'S CURRENTLY TIED UP IN THE

109
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,560
ISRAELI COURT SYSTEM WITH THE

110
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,609
FOREIGN MINISTRY CALLING IT A

111
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:12,733
"REAL ESTATE DISPUTE."

112
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,600
BUT IT'S WORTH KNOWING THAT THE

113
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:14,742
U.N.'S COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN

114
00:03:14,766 --> 00:03:16,300
RIGHTS HAS SAID THESE EXPULSIONS

115
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:17,366
WOULD VIOLATE ISRAEL'S

116
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:18,673
OBLIGATIONS UNDER INTERNATIONAL

117
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,766
LAW.

118
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,566
SO IT IS NOT HARD TO SEE WHY

119
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:23,333
SANITIZED TERMS LIKE "EVICTIONS"

120
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,166
OR "PROPERTY DISPUTES" RANKLE

121
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:28,333
THOSE WHO LIVE THERE.

122
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,566
YOU GREW UP IN THE

123
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:30,366
NEIGHBORHOOD.

124
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:31,509
YOUR FAMILY HOME IS SLATED FOR

125
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:32,166
EVICTION.

126
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:33,733
WHAT IS THE SCENE RIGHT NOW?

127
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,266
WELL, I... THANK YOU SO MUCH

128
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,166
FOR HAVING ME.

129
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:37,353
TO START, IT'S NOT REALLY AN

130
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,800
EVICTION.

131
00:03:37,866 --> 00:03:39,233
IT'S FORCED ETHNIC DISPLACEMENT,

132
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,466
TO BE ACCURATE.

133
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:41,613
EVICTION DOES NOT IMPLY THE

134
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,633
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HEAVILY

135
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,300
ARMED POLICE AND ARMY AND

136
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:47,566
SETTLERS COLLUDING, BLOWING UP

137
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:48,566
YOUR DOORS, THROWING YOUR

138
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:49,742
CHILDREN FROM YOUR WINDOWS AND

139
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:51,266
USING BRUTE FORCE TO THROW YOU

140
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,266
OUT IN THE STREET AND ASSAULTING

141
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,376
AND ARRESTING YOU SHOULD YOU

142
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,500
RESIST.

143
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:55,400
IT DOESN'T IMPLY THE GRENADES.

144
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:56,366
IT DOESN'T IMPLY THE

145
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:59,166
RUBBER-COATED BULLETS.

146
00:03:59,233 --> 00:03:59,533
RIGHT.

147
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,733
THE THREAT OF EVICTION IS

148
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,400
ACCURATE ONLY IN A VERY

149
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:03,933
SUPERFICIAL LEVEL... IN THAT ONE

150
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,042
DAY YOU LIVE SOMEWHERE, THE NEXT

151
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:05,633
DAY YOU DON'T, AND THAT CHANGE

152
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,500
WASN'T YOUR CHOICE, BUT IT

153
00:04:06,566 --> 00:04:07,733
DOESN'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY.

154
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,333
IT'S LIKE RUNNING A HEADLINE

155
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,409
THAT SAYS "MATT GAETZ REACHES

156
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:11,900
OUT TO FLORIDA YOUTH."

157
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:13,500
SURE, NOT INACCURATE.

158
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:15,033
BUT IT'S MISSING SOME PRETTY

159
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,242
CRUCIAL DETAILS ABOUT THE EXACT

160
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:17,433
NATURE OF THAT INTERACTION.

161
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,233
AND LOOK, IT IS TRUE THAT

162
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,566
MILITANTS FROM PALESTINIAN

163
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:22,100
GROUPS LIKE HAMAS FIRED OVER A

164
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,566
THOUSAND ROCKETS TOWARD ISRAEL

165
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:27,866
THIS WEEK, AND THAT IS

166
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:28,200
REPREHENSIBLE.

167
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:29,800
BUT... AND I REALIZE THIS IS THE

168
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:32,300
MOST LOAD-BEARING CONJUNCTION IN

169
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:33,666
HISTORY, "BUT"... THE MAJORITY

170
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:36,466
OF THOSE ROCKETS THANKFULLY

171
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:37,576
DIDN'T REACH THEIR TARGET, FOR A

172
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:37,933
VERY CLEAR REASON.

173
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,833
THE CASUALTIES AND THE DAMAGE

174
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,140
WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATER BUT FOR

175
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,480
ISRAELI INTERCEPTOR ROCKETS, THE

176
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:43,100
SO-CALLED IRON DOME, WHICH BLEW

177
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,166
MOST OF THE INCOMING MISSILES TO

178
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:46,666
PIECES.

179
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:48,333
YEAH, ISRAEL HAS AN

180
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
SO-CALLED IRON DOME.

181
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:52,200
AND I KNOW "WHAT IF WE BLEW UP

182
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:54,333
THE ROCKETS WITH MORE ROCKETS?"

183
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,233
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING SOMEONE

184
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:55,866
DRUNKENLY WROTE DOWN ON A NAPKIN

185
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:57,042
ONCE, BUT IT IS A REAL MILITARY

186
00:04:57,066 --> 00:05:01,900
DEFENSE SYSTEM THAT WORKS.

187
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:03,900
AND I ALSO KNOW NOT ALL THE

188
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:05,033
ROCKETS WERE SHOT DOWN.

189
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,633
ISRAELI CIVILIANS WERE KILLED

190
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,842
THIS WEEK, WHICH IS TERRIBLE.

191
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:12,100
BUT THE POINT IS, THIS ISN'T

192
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,933
"TIT FOR TAT."

193
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,366
THERE IS A MASSIVE IMBALANCE

194
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:17,733
WHEN IT COMES TO THE TWO SIDES'

195
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,700
WEAPONRY AND CAPABILITIES.

196
00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:19,333
WHILE MOST OF THE ROCKETS AIMED

197
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:19,900
TOWARD ISRAELI CITIZENS THIS

198
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:20,533
WEEK WERE INTERCEPTED, ISRAEL'S

199
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,866
AIR STRIKES WERE NOT.

200
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:24,466
THEY HIT THEIR TARGETS,

201
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,100
INCLUDING A HOUSE IN A REFUGEE

202
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,500
CAMP, A BUILDING HOUSING THE

203
00:05:27,566 --> 00:05:29,400
ASSOCIATED PRESS AND AL JAZEERA,

204
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:31,200
AND THIS 13-STORY OFFICE AND

205
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:33,166
APARTMENT BUILDING.

206
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,433
AND WHILE ISRAEL INSISTED THAT

207
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:35,733
THERE WERE MILITARY TARGETS IN

208
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,133
THAT BUILDING AND THAT THEY'D

209
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,276
DESTROYED IT AS HUMANELY AS

210
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,666
POSSIBLE, EVEN WARNING PEOPLE TO

211
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:41,666
EVACUATE BEFOREHAND, FOR THE

212
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:43,633
RECORD, "DESTROYING A CIVILIAN

213
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,633
RESIDENCE" SURE SEEMS LIKE A WAR

214
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,366
CRIME REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU

215
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:49,533
SEND A COURTESY HEADS-UP TEXT.

216
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,266
AND WHEN DOZENS OF PEOPLE HAVE

217
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,542
SEEN THEIR HOMES OR LIVELIHOODS

218
00:05:52,566 --> 00:05:54,133
DESTROYED, IT DOESN'T REALLY

219
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,066
HELP THAT THE ISRAELI MILITARY

220
00:05:56,133 --> 00:05:57,833
POSTED THIS TRIUMPHANT MEME

221
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,966
SHOWING THE EXPLOSION AND THE

222
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:02,533
RUBBLE LABELED "BEFORE" AND

223
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:02,966
"AFTER."

224
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:03,833
"LOOK WHAT WE DID!

225
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,333
PEOPLE LIVED THERE BEFORE, AND

226
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
NOW THEY CAN'T!

227
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:07,666
YOU GET IT, RIGHT?"

228
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:12,000
AND OBVIOUSLY, IN GENERAL, YOU

229
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:13,533
SHOULD PROBABLY NEVER MEME

230
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,200
A WAR CRIME.

231
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:15,200
BUT IF YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO,

232
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:15,833
AT LEAST GO WITH SOMETHING LESS

233
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,433
BORING THAN THE BEFORE/AFTER

234
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:16,800
TEMPLATE.

235
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:17,876
MAYBE USE THE DRAKE MEME OR THE

236
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,166
DISASTER GIRL.

237
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:20,666
THERE'S A BUILDING COMING DOWN,

238
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:21,942
SO CHECKMARK ALREADY THERE, AND

239
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:23,266
IT'S A LITTLE GIRL WITH EYES

240
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,833
THAT SCREAM "I DON'T KNOW WHAT

241
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,466
THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS ARE, AND

242
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:26,033
FRANKLY, I DON'T CARE."

243
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,766
THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT, IT

244
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,100
WORKS PERFECTLY.

245
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:29,933
THE FACT IS, THE CITIZENS OF

246
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,333
GAZA DON'T HAVE AN IRON DOME TO

247
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,600
PROTECT THEM THE WAY THAT THE

248
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,033
CITIZENS OF ISRAEL DO.

249
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,566
IT'S ONE OF THE MANY WAYS

250
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:38,233
THEY'RE AT A SIGNIFICANT

251
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,000
DISADVANTAGE.

252
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,566
ALTHOUGH AN ISRAELI MILITARY

253
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:42,433
SPOKESPERSON TRIED TO PUSH BACK

254
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,642
ON THE IDEA THERE'S MUCH OF A

255
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,366
DISCREPANCY THERE.

256
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:47,133
SOMEBODY ON TWITTER SAID THAT

257
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,533
THE PALESTINIANS DON'T HAVE AN

258
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,366
IRON DOME.

259
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:52,666
I SAY YES, THEY HAVE AN IRON

260
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:52,866
DOME.

261
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:53,700
IT'S CALLED "DON'T FIRE ROCKETS

262
00:06:53,766 --> 00:06:54,266
AT ISRAELI CIVILIANS AND WE

263
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,600
WON'T FIRE ANYTHING AT GAZA."

264
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,400
YEAH.

265
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:57,066
BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF

266
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:58,133
DIFFERENCES.

267
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,033
"IRON DOME," FOR ONE, SOUNDS

268
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,666
MUCH COOLER, AND ALSO, IT HAS

269
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:03,066
THE SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE OF

270
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:05,000
BEING AN ACTUAL DEFENSE SYSTEM

271
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:06,333
THAT EXISTS, UNLIKE GAZA'S,

272
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,700
WHICH IS MOSTLY, "TRY NOT TO BE

273
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:09,766
WHERE THE BOMBS ARE LANDING."

274
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,766
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE HERE,

275
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,200
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

276
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,309
PALESTINIANS IN GAZA ARE NOT

277
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,666
PART OF HAMAS.

278
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:17,533
THEY DON'T GET TOGETHER AND ALL

279
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,100
DECIDE TO LAUNCH ROCKETS.

280
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:22,066
IT'S NOT A FUCKING CO-OP BOARD.

281
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:23,666
BUT WHEN ISRAEL FIRES ROCKETS AT

282
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:25,200
GAZA, IT ENDANGERS ALL

283
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:26,766
PALESTINIANS THERE.

284
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,466
MAYBE "SOMEBODY ON TWITTER"

285
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:30,066
COULD POINT THAT OUT TO THAT

286
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:31,266
GUY.

287
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,342
TO PEOPLE IN GAZA, IT CAN SEEM

288
00:07:32,366 --> 00:07:33,766
LIKE THE ONLY TIME ANYONE PAYS

289
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,033
ATTENTION TO WHAT'S HAPPENING

290
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,833
THERE IS WHEN HAMAS IS FIRING

291
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,866
ROCKETS, WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLY

292
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:39,133
VERY FRUSTRATING, BECAUSE

293
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,166
THEY'VE BEEN LIVING UNDER A

294
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:41,666
SUFFOCATING BLOCKADE FOR

295
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:43,833
14 YEARS.

296
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,666
AND IN ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED

297
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:48,233
PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES,

298
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,733
PALESTINIANS ARE ESSENTIALLY

299
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,600
BEING GOVERNED BY A FORM OF

300
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:52,809
APARTHEID, AN ASSESSMENT SIGNED

301
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:53,400
OFF ON BY BOTH INTERNATIONAL AND

302
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:55,900
ISRAELI HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS.

303
00:07:55,966 --> 00:07:57,333
LIFE IN GAZA IS HARD EVEN WHEN

304
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,366
THEY'RE NOT BEING BOMBED.

305
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:01,066
AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS

306
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:02,142
IMPLICITLY COSIGNED ON THE

307
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,033
BRUTALLY HARD LINE ISRAEL HAS

308
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,400
BEEN TAKING.

309
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:06,709
THIS GUY BASICALLY GAVE ISRAEL A

310
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:07,600
GREEN LIGHT TO DO ANYTHING IT

311
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,433
WANTED FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS,

312
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,600
AND WHILE BIDEN HAS HAD THE

313
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:11,800
OPPORTUNITY TO RESET THAT

314
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,100
RELATIONSHIP, HIS

315
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,242
ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE THIS

316
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:15,933
WEEK HAS BEEN DEEPLY

317
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,666
UNDERWHELMING, GIVING A GENERIC

318
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:19,833
STATEMENT THAT "ISRAEL HAS A

319
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,300
RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF."

320
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:24,033
IT'S THE EXACT SAME LINE THAT

321
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,400
OBAMA SAID AND THAT BUSH SAID

322
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:26,866
BEFORE HIM.

323
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:29,400
"ISRAEL HAS A RIGHT TO DEFEND

324
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:30,400
ITSELF" IS JUST SOMETHING ALL

325
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:31,666
PRESIDENTS END UP SAYING OUT

326
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:33,200
LOUD AT SOME POINT IN OFFICE,

327
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:34,166
LIKE "MY FELLOW AMERICANS" OR

328
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:35,766
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN THERE ARE NO

329
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:36,633
ALIENS?

330
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,400
THIS IS SOME BULLSHIT."

331
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:41,266
AND LOOK, IT'S NOT THAT ISRAEL

332
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:41,966
DOESN'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEFEND

333
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:43,366
ITSELF... IT'S JUST THAT LINE

334
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:44,833
CANNOT BE USED TO EXCUSE

335
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,666
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING.

336
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,700
MULTIPLE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN

337
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:49,133
KILLED THIS WEEK... EIGHT IN A

338
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,400
SINGLE STRIKE JUST YESTERDAY.

339
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,300
AND THE U.S. IS HEAVILY

340
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,133
IMPLICATED HERE, NOT JUST BY

341
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,666
SERVING AS ISRAEL'S DIPLOMATIC

342
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:58,333
SHIELD AT THE U.N., BUT BY

343
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,800
CONSTANTLY REFUSING TO CRITICIZE

344
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:02,800
THE INDEFENSIBLE.

345
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:04,600
WATCH AS JUST THIS WEEK A STATE

346
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:05,966
DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN DESPERATELY

347
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:07,533
TRIED TO EQUIVOCATE WHEN ASKED A

348
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,066
PRETTY SIMPLE QUESTION.

349
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,133
I WANT TO ASK ON EAST

350
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:11,733
JERUSALEM.

351
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,300
I DON'T WANT TO HARP ON THIS

352
00:09:12,366 --> 00:09:13,366
EITHER.

353
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,666
BUT THE ISRAELIS KILLED 13

354
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:15,800
PEOPLE JUST NOW, YOU KNOW,

355
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:16,966
INCLUDING MAYBE FIVE OR SIX

356
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:17,300
CHILDREN.

357
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:17,833
DO YOU CONDEMN THAT?

358
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,100
DO YOU CONDEMN THE KILLING OF

359
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,933
CHILDREN?

360
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,633
SAID...

361
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,533
I'M ASKING, DO YOU CONDEMN

362
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,640
THE KILLING OF PALESTINIAN

363
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,166
CHILDREN?

364
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,433
OBVIOUSLY... AND THESE

365
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,233
REPORTS ARE JUST EMERGING.

366
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:29,966
AND I UNDERSTAND... I WAS JUST

367
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:30,933
SPEAKING TO THE TEAM.

368
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,966
I UNDERSTAND WE DON'T HAVE

369
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:33,533
INDEPENDENT CONFIRMATION OF

370
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,266
FACTS ON THE GROUND YET, SO I'M

371
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,133
VERY HESITANT TO GET INTO

372
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,800
REPORTS THAT ARE JUST EMERGING.

373
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:38,766
OBVIOUSLY, THE DEATHS OF

374
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,866
CIVILIANS, BE THEY ISRAELI OR

375
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:42,109
PALESTINIANS, ARE SOMETHING WE

376
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:44,433
WOULD TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY.

377
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,000
HOLY SHIT, HE JUST

378
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:47,142
ASKED YOU, "IS CHILD MURDER

379
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,200
BAD?"

380
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:49,933
THIS REALLY ISN'T HARD.

381
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,700
JUST SAY YES.

382
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:53,909
THE ONLY SCENARIO IN WHICH THE

383
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:55,109
ANSWER TO "IS KILLING CHILDREN

384
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:56,766
WRONG?" GETS TRICKY IS IF YOU'RE

385
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,033
A TIME TRAVELER IN 1890s

386
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,866
AUSTRIA TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHY

387
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,133
YOU JUST KILLED THE HITLER

388
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,600
FAMILY'S BOUNCING NEW BABY BOY.

389
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,700
"I KNOW HOW THIS LOOKS, BUT

390
00:10:03,766 --> 00:10:07,433
IT IS COMPLICATED."

391
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,300
LOOK, THERE IS A REAL TENDENCY,

392
00:10:09,366 --> 00:10:11,633
PARTICULARLY IN AMERICA, TO

393
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,433
"BOTH SIDES" THIS SITUATION, AND

394
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,676
I'M NOT SAYING THAT THERE AREN'T

395
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,700
SOME AREAS WHERE THAT'S

396
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:17,633
WARRANTED, BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO

397
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:23,200
RECOGNIZE THERE ARE ALSO AREAS

398
00:10:23,266 --> 00:10:23,700
WHERE IT'S SIMPLY NOT.

399
00:10:23,766 --> 00:10:24,600
BOTH SIDES ARE FIRING ROCKETS,

400
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,433
BUT ONE SIDE HAS ONE OF THE MOST

401
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:25,966
ADVANCED MILITARIES IN THE

402
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:26,666
WORLD.

403
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,066
BOTH SIDES ARE SUFFERING

404
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:28,666
HEARTBREAKING CASUALTIES, BUT

405
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:29,400
ONE SIDE IS SUFFERING THEM

406
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:31,000
EXPONENTIALLY.

407
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:32,300
AND IT'S NOT LIKE THE U.S. IS

408
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:33,376
OPERATING FROM THE MORAL HIGH

409
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,066
GROUND HERE.

410
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,233
IT'S OBVIOUSLY NO STRANGER TO

411
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,700
DRONE-STRIKING WEDDINGS AND

412
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:38,876
SAYING, "WE WERE JUST TRYING TO

413
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,333
TARGET ENEMY COMBATANTS."

414
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,366
THIS COUNTRY HAS BLOOD ON ITS

415
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:43,633
HANDS TOO.

416
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,433
AND LOOK, IF YOU BELIEVE

417
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,966
ISRAEL'S ACTIONS ARE WARRANTED

418
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:47,700
AND PROPORTIONATE THIS WEEK,

419
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:49,266
YOU'RE WELCOME TO TRY AND MAKE

420
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,433
THAT ARGUMENT.

421
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,466
BUT WE'VE GOT TO START HAVING

422
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:53,833
THIS CONVERSATION HONESTLY, AND

423
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,433
FALLING BACK ON CONVENIENT

424
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,300
SANITIZED TERMS LIKE

425
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:58,933
"REAL ESTATE DISPUTES" AND

426
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,633
"AIR STRIKES ON MILITANTS" FEELS

427
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,300
DISINGENUOUS WHEN WHAT YOU'RE

428
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:05,100
DESCRIBING IS "FORCING PEOPLE

429
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,100
FROM THE HOMES THEY'VE LIVED IN

430
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,500
FOR DECADES AND KILLING

431
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,366
CIVILIANS AND CHILDREN."

432
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:11,833
AND AGAIN, NONE OF THIS FREES

433
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,300
HAMAS FROM RESPONSIBILITY.

434
00:11:13,366 --> 00:11:14,900
BUT HAMAS DOESN'T REPRESENT ALL

435
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,200
PALESTINIANS, JUST AS WHAT

436
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:17,866
ISRAEL IS DOING RIGHT NOW

437
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:20,033
DOESN'T REPRESENT ALL ISRAELIS,

438
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,100
OR INDEED JEWISH PEOPLE.

439
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:27,233
LOTS IS COMPLICATED HERE, BUT

440
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,476
SOME THINGS ARE PRETTY SIMPLE.

441
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,433
ONE SIDE IS SUFFERING MUCH MORE.

442
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,900
AND IF AMERICA REALLY WANTS TO

443
00:11:32,966 --> 00:11:33,733
HELP, IT MIGHT WANT TO SERIOUSLY

444
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,733
CONSIDER CHANGING ITS LONG-HELD

445
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,533
POSITION HERE.

446
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,433
BECAUSE FOR DECADES, THE

447
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,233
BACKBONE OF AMERICA'S POLICY IN

448
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,200
THE MIDDLE EAST HAS BEEN THAT

449
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:41,833
AMERICA IS AN UNWAVERING FRIEND

450
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,133
TO ISRAEL.

451
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,466
WHICH IS A GREAT THING TO BE,

452
00:11:45,533 --> 00:11:46,666
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, I

453
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:49,433
WOULD HOPE THAT A REAL FRIEND

454
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,433
WILL TELL ME WHEN I'M BEING AN

455
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,200
ASSHOLE AND DEFINITELY WHEN I'M

456
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:55,476
COMMITTING A FUCKING WAR CRIME.

457
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,533
AND NOW THIS.

458
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
AND NOW,

459
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:03,366
ARI MELBER, RAP GENIUS.

460
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:09,233
WILL JUST NOT FUCKING STOP.

461
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,766
GOOD EVENING, AS SMITH WOULD

462
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:13,333
SAY.

463
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,966
ALL THIS CHASING.

464
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:18,076
TO PARAPHRASE LAURYN HILL, HE

465
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,233
MAY THINK IS MORE POWERFUL THAN

466
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,442
TWO CLEOPATRA'S BUT HE IS STILL

467
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:24,233
READY TO FLIP IT IN THE SWAMP ON

468
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,466
A DIRTY MATTRESS.

469
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:27,966
THERE IS A LYRIC FOR THAT,

470
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:29,533
MARGARET, WHICH IS JAY-Z SAID,

471
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,200
MAMA ALWAYS TOLD ME DON'T ARGUE

472
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:32,542
WITH FOOLS BECAUSE PEOPLE FROM A

473
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:35,333
DISTANCE CAN'T SEE WHO IS WHO.

474
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,333
I HATE THE NEW KANYE, THE BAD

475
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,933
MOOD KANYE, THE NEWS KANYE, I

476
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,733
MISS THE OLD KANYE.

477
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,133
WHEN I LOOK IN THE MIRROR, ALL I

478
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,633
SEE IS FALSE.

479
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,933
FLAWS.

480
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,866
I BELIEVE THERE'S A GOD ABOVE

481
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:54,033
ME.

482
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,400
AND THAT TRUST THE GOD OF

483
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:56,833
EVERYTHING ELSE

484
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,566
THAT'S PRETTY POWERFUL.

485
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:03,233
IT WASN'T AT DRAKE WHO SAID, THE

486
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,366
GAME IS SOLD SEPARATE.

487
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:07,400
ANOTHER W WAY TO PUT IT IS, IT

488
00:13:07,466 --> 00:13:09,066
STARTED FROM THE BOTTOM AND NOW

489
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:09,833
WE ARE HERE.

490
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,233
YOU COULD PUT IT THAT WAY,

491
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:20,300
ARI, NOW WE... YOU COULD.

492
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:21,433
MOVING ON.

493
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:22,033
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

494
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,433
GUNS.

495
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,400
Y'KNOW, BIG PEW-PEW STICKS THAT

496
00:13:23,466 --> 00:13:25,900
GO BOOM-BOOM.

497
00:13:25,966 --> 00:13:26,976
GUNS ARE EVERYWHERE IN AMERICA,

498
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,466
AND I DO MEAN EVERYWHERE.

499
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:28,100
HOW MANY GUNS DO YOU THINK I

500
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:28,733
CAN HIDE UNDERNEATH A HAWAIIAN

501
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:28,933
SHIRT?

502
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,566
OF COURSE, WE GOT THE GRAY MAN.

503
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:30,233
GOT MY BERETTA MODEL 85.

504
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:30,833
FEELS LIKE A KAHR ARMED CT45.

505
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,666
CHARTER ARMS UNDERCOVER .38

506
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:31,966
SPECIAL.

507
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:33,142
GRANDPA DAVE'S OLD DERRINGER.

508
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,500
THIS IS A SCCY CPX-2.

509
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:37,100
SMITH & WESSON 442.

510
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:37,866
OH, WAIT!

511
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:41,566
ONE MORE.

512
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:43,000
NORTH AMERICAN ARMS SIDEWINDER

513
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:43,800
.22 MAGNUM, JUST IN CASE YOU

514
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,366
NEED SOMETHING SMALL.

515
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:49,066
WOW.

516
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:49,566
THAT IS THE SECOND-MOST

517
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:50,566
HORRIFYING THING YOU CAN FIND

518
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:51,500
COMING AT YOU IN A HAWAIIAN

519
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:52,842
SHIRT, RIGHT AFTER JOHN LASSETER

520
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,733
ON "NATIONAL HUG YOUR BOSS DAY."

521
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,100
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, THE REVEAL

522
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,242
OF THE THUMBELINA-SIZED GUN IN

523
00:13:57,266 --> 00:13:57,833
HIS TOMMY BAHAMA POCKET WAS AN

524
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,533
M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN-WORTHY TWIST.

525
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:00,966
WELL DONE, TINY GUN.

526
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:02,076
YOU ARE BOTH SUPERFLUOUS AND

527
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,433
SURPRISING.

528
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,566
BUT THIS STORY ISN'T SO MUCH

529
00:14:05,633 --> 00:14:07,833
ABOUT GUNS THEMSELVES, AS IT IS

530
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,109
ABOUT ONE PARTICULAR LAW THAT'S

531
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:10,400
SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED HOW

532
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:12,133
THEY'RE USED.

533
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,733
I'M TALKING ABOUT

534
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,766
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS.

535
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,566
30 STATES CURRENTLY HAVE THEM.

536
00:14:18,633 --> 00:14:19,709
AND WHILE THEY WERE INITIALLY

537
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,200
PITCHED AS A LAW-AND-ORDER

538
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:20,833
MEASURE TO PROTECT PEOPLE FORCED

539
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,666
TO MAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS IN

540
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:23,500
IMPOSSIBLE LIFE-OR-DEATH

541
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:25,333
SITUATIONS, IN PRACTICE THEY CAN

542
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,966
BE INVOKED IN INCIDENTS THAT

543
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,900
REALLY SEEM LIKE THEY DIDN'T

544
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:30,366
NEED TO TURN DEADLY.

545
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:31,866
THE MAN WHO SHOT AND KILLED A

546
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:33,109
FATHER OF FOUR AT A FLORISSANT

547
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:34,166
BAR IS FREE TONIGHT.

548
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:35,633
SO FAR, THE GUNMAN'S NOT FACING

549
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,633
CHARGES FOR THE SHOOTING AT

550
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,500
SHOW-ME'S BAR AND GRILL.

551
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:41,033
THE ST. LOUIS COUNTY

552
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,633
PROSECUTOR SAYS HE NEEDS MORE

553
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,466
TIME TO DECIDE WHETHER HE'LL

554
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:44,000
PROSECUTE THE GUNMAN.

555
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:44,800
THAT'S BECAUSE MISSOURI'S

556
00:14:44,866 --> 00:14:45,566
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAW IS

557
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:52,933
COMPLICATED.

558
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,533
SCOTT BEARY WAS KILLED WHEN

559
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,200
AN ARGUMENT OVER HOW HEAVY A DOG

560
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:54,966
COULD WEIGH BECAME PHYSICAL.

561
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:55,400
HOLY SHIT.

562
00:14:55,466 --> 00:14:56,233
NOT ONLY IS THAT A MASSIVE

563
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,442
OVERREACTION, IT'S A POINTLESS

564
00:14:57,466 --> 00:14:59,533
ARGUMENT.

565
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,000
EVERYONE KNOWS DOGS COME IN A

566
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,300
WIDE ARRAY OF SIZES, FROM

567
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:03,400
POCKET-SIZED SWEETIES TO

568
00:15:03,466 --> 00:15:04,900
SLENDER KINGS TO DENSE BOYS TO

569
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:06,600
DROOPY BOYS TO BIG HONKIN' BOYS

570
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:09,700
TO STANDARD.

571
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:12,566
THAT'S JUST VETERINARY SCIENCE.

572
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:13,166
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS GAINED

573
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:14,133
NOTORIETY NEARLY A DECADE AGO

574
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,566
WHEN POLICE CLAIMED FLORIDA'S

575
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:16,742
LAW KEPT THEM FROM INITIALLY

576
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:17,700
ARRESTING GEORGE ZIMMERMAN AFTER

577
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:20,100
HE SHOT AND KILLED 17-YEAR-OLD

578
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,366
TRAYVON MARTIN.

579
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:23,233
MORE RECENTLY, THEY'VE BEEN

580
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,433
FLOATED AS A POTENTIAL DEFENSE

581
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,633
FOR THE KILLERS OF AHMAUD

582
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,833
ARBERY.

583
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,566
AND THOSE ARE JUST TWO

584
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:31,566
DEVASTATING EXAMPLES OF MANY.

585
00:15:31,633 --> 00:15:32,776
AND DON'T WORRY, WE'RE NOT GOING

586
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,833
TO SHOW YOU THE

587
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,700
FAR-TOO-PLENTIFUL FOOTAGE OF

588
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:36,766
PEOPLE GETTING SHOT IN PUBLIC

589
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:37,500
PLACES TONIGHT.

590
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:38,166
FRANKLY, WE'RE JUST ONE

591
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:39,166
SENSELESS MURDER AWAY FROM HBO

592
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:40,242
MAX PUTTING THIS SHOW IN THE

593
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:41,276
"ENDLESS PARADE OF HUMAN MISERY"

594
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:41,966
CATEGORY ALONGSIDE "CHERNOBYL"

595
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:43,400
AND "ENTOURAGE."

596
00:15:43,466 --> 00:15:45,000
BUT GIVEN THE PREVALENCE OF

597
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:46,142
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS... AND

598
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,633
THE RACIAL DISPARITIES IN WHO

599
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,600
THEY DO, AND CRUCIALLY, DON'T

600
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,466
PROTECT... WE THOUGHT TONIGHT

601
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:50,300
IT'D BE WORTH LOOKING AT THEM.

602
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,000
AND LET'S START WITH WHY,

603
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:52,333
EXACTLY, STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS

604
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,466
WERE CREATED.

605
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:57,266
BECAUSE BEFORE THEY CAME ALONG,

606
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,433
MOST STATES ALREADY HAD

607
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,566
SELF-DEFENSE LAWS ON THE BOOKS

608
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:03,333
THAT TRADITIONALLY INCLUDED AN

609
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,333
ELEMENT KNOWN AS A "DUTY TO

610
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,333
RETREAT," MEANING YOU COULDN'T

611
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,833
RESORT TO USING DEADLY FORCE IN

612
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,166
A CONFRONTATION IF YOU COULD

613
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:13,733
SAFELY AVOID OR DE-ESCALATE IT.

614
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,866
NOW, IN MANY STATES, AN

615
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,333
EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE WAS A

616
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,900
SO-CALLED "CASTLE DOCTRINE," A

617
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:21,566
LEGAL THEORY ARGUING THAT YOUR

618
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:23,333
HOME IS YOUR CASTLE, AND THERE,

619
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,366
YOU CAN USE DEADLY FORCE MUCH

620
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:26,333
MORE BROADLY TO PROTECT YOURSELF

621
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,100
AGAINST INTRUDERS.

622
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,700
THE KEY THING STAND-YOUR-GROUND

623
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:29,842
LAWS DID WAS REMOVE THAT "DUTY

624
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:32,033
TO RETREAT" FROM PUBLIC PLACES,

625
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,533
BASICALLY EXTENDING THE CASTLE

626
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,366
DOCTRINE TO ANYWHERE YOU HAVE A

627
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:37,366
LEGAL RIGHT TO BE.

628
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:38,673
IF YOU HAVE A "REASONABLE FEAR"

629
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,133
SOMEONE MIGHT HURT YOU, YOU HAVE

630
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,633
JUST AS MUCH RIGHT TO SHOOT THEM

631
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,842
IN THE STREET AS YOU WOULD IF

632
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:43,876
THEY WERE COMING THROUGH THE

633
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,966
WINDOW OF YOUR HOUSE.

634
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:47,300
AND THIS CHANGE WAS LARGELY

635
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:48,766
THANKS TO THE ADVOCACY OF ONE

636
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:49,700
WOMAN WITH A PRETTY COMPELLING

637
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:51,066
STORY.

638
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:53,133
MARION HAMMER SAYS SHE WAS

639
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,766
WALKING TO HER CAR AFTER A LONG

640
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,733
DAY AT THE OFFICE WHEN SHE WAS

641
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,466
ACCOSTED BY A CAR FULL OF MEN.

642
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:03,200
BUT SHE HAD A SURPRISE FOR THEM.

643
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:04,633
I DREW THE GUN UP THROUGH THE

644
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,100
HEADLIGHTS OF THE CAR AND I

645
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,966
AIMED AT THE DRIVER.

646
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:11,566
AND SOMEBODY IN THE CAR

647
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:14,233
SCREAMED, "THE BITCH GOT A GUN!"

648
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:19,833
"THE BITCH GOT A GUN."

649
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,200
I HONESTLY DID NOT EXPECT TO

650
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:21,733
HEAR THAT COME OUT OF THAT

651
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,400
WOMAN'S MOUTH.

652
00:17:22,466 --> 00:17:23,100
"HELP YOURSELF TO SOME HARD

653
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:23,966
CANDIES IN THE CERAMIC PIG"?

654
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:24,266
ABSOLUTELY.

655
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:24,833
"TAKE OFF YOUR BOOTS SO YOU

656
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,433
DON'T TRACK ANYTHING ONTO THE

657
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,500
WALL-TO-WALL CARPETING"?

658
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:26,933
OF COURSE.

659
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,900
BUT A CURSE WORD?

660
00:17:27,966 --> 00:17:29,566
IN THE DAYLIGHT?

661
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,100
NOT IN 10,000 CONTRACTIONS OF

662
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,600
THE UNIVERSE.

663
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:33,776
BUT THE IMPORTANT PART OF HER

664
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,666
STORY CONCERNS WHAT SHE CLAIMS A

665
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:36,033
POLICE CHIEF SAID TO HER AFTER

666
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,733
SHE'D TOLD HER STORY PUBLICLY.

667
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,700
THE POLICE CHIEF TOLD ME,

668
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:43,366
"WELL, IN THAT SITUATION, IF

669
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:44,100
YOU'D CALLED THE POLICE, WE'D

670
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,366
HAVE ARRESTED YOU, BECAUSE YOU

671
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,666
WERE THE ONLY ONE WHO EMPLOYED

672
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:52,433
THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE."

673
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,200
AND THAT MADE ME ANGRY.

674
00:17:56,266 --> 00:17:57,466
AND THAT ARGUMENT IS

675
00:17:57,533 --> 00:17:59,166
THE ABSOLUTE CORE OF THE CASE

676
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:00,342
FOR STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS...

677
00:18:00,366 --> 00:18:01,666
THAT MARION HAMMER COULD HAVE

678
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:02,733
BEEN ARRESTED FOR SIMPLY

679
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:04,266
DEFENDING HERSELF.

680
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,066
NOW, SHE WASN'T, OF COURSE.

681
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:05,500
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

682
00:18:05,566 --> 00:18:06,366
BUT SOMEONE SAID SHE MIGHT HAVE

683
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:07,633
BEEN, AND THAT MADE HER ANGRY.

684
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,700
BUT A FEW THINGS.

685
00:18:09,766 --> 00:18:11,400
BECAUSE WHILE EVERYTHING ABOUT

686
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:12,733
MARION HAMMER SEEMS LIKE A

687
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,566
SWEET, EVERYDAY GRANDMOTHER...

688
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:15,033
RIGHT DOWN TO THIS FELINE

689
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,700
GLAMOUR SHOT OF HER POSTED ON A

690
00:18:16,766 --> 00:18:18,600
CAT BREEDER'S WEBSITE... YOU

691
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:19,866
SHOULD KNOW SHE'S ALSO ONE THE

692
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,800
COUNTRY'S MOST POWERFUL GUN

693
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,366
LOBBYISTS AND A FORMER PRESIDENT

694
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:25,033
OF THE NRA.

695
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,666
SHE'S PERSONALLY HELPED PUSH

696
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:30,700
THROUGH DOZENS OF GUN LAWS IN

697
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:31,842
FLORIDA ALONE, INCLUDING A 1987

698
00:18:31,866 --> 00:18:33,400
BILL ALLOWING CONCEAL AND CARRY

699
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:34,400
PERMITS... A LAW THEN

700
00:18:34,466 --> 00:18:35,966
DUPLICATED, IN SOME FORM, IN

701
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:37,800
ALMOST EVERY STATE, LEADING TO

702
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,366
MORE THAN 16 MILLION AMERICANS

703
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:41,100
CURRENTLY HAVING LICENSES TO

704
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,233
CARRY CONCEALED HANDGUNS.

705
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,900
SO THAT MARGARITAVILLE ARSENAL

706
00:18:43,966 --> 00:18:45,000
YOU SAW EARLIER?

707
00:18:45,066 --> 00:18:46,200
YOU HAVE THIS DANA CARVEY

708
00:18:46,266 --> 00:18:47,346
CHARACTER TO THANK FOR THAT

709
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,400
SITUATION.

710
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:52,966
AND WHILE IT'S NOT ENTIRELY

711
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:54,600
RELEVANT, HAMMER'S ADVOCACY

712
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,100
WASN'T LIMITED TO GUNS.

713
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,276
SHE ALSO SUCCESSFULLY KILLED A

714
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,200
PETITION FROM 10,000 SCHOOL

715
00:18:58,266 --> 00:18:59,900
CHILDREN TO CHANGE THE FLORIDA

716
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:01,366
STATE BIRD TO THE SCRUB JAY, A

717
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:04,166
BIRD SO FRIENDLY IT APPARENTLY

718
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:06,833
EATS PEANUTS OUT OF YOUR HAND.

719
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,566
SHE OBJECTED BECAUSE, IN HER

720
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:09,033
WORDS, "BEGGING FOR FOOD ISN'T

721
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,733
SWEET, " " IT'S LAZY AND IT'S A

722
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,300
WELFARE MENTALITY."

723
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:13,433
AND "THEY EAT THE EGGS OF OTHER

724
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,266
BIRDS, THAT'S ROBBERY AND

725
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,333
MURDER.

726
00:19:15,366 --> 00:19:17,100
I DON'T THINK SCRUB JAYS CAN

727
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,500
EVEN SING."

728
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:19,833
AND, OKAY, SLOW DOWN THERE,

729
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,700
MARION.

730
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:21,533
SET ASIDE "LAZY,"

731
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,100
"WELFARE MENTALITY," AND

732
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,033
"ROBBERY AND MURDER," WHICH IS A

733
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,766
LOT TO PUT ON A BIRD.

734
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,266
"SCRUB JAYS CAN'T SING"?

735
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:32,333
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TELL THAT TO

736
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,466
THE SCRUB JAY, MARION.

737
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:37,133
SEE?

738
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,900
THAT'S FINE.

739
00:19:37,966 --> 00:19:41,300
IS IT GREAT?

740
00:19:41,366 --> 00:19:42,266
NO, IT'S NOT GREAT.

741
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:42,533
IT'S FINE.

742
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,266
THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE.

743
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:43,866
SURE, THE BIRD'S NO MARIAH, BUT

744
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:44,400
IT'S ALSO NO ROSEANNE.

745
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:45,133
IF THAT BIRD IS ANYONE, IT'S

746
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,733
FERGIE.

747
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,466
YOU HEARD ME.

748
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:47,666
THE SCRUB JAY IS FERGIE.

749
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:49,066
TWEET IT, TOK IT, PUT IT IN YOUR

750
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:49,300
POCKET.

751
00:19:49,366 --> 00:19:50,033
I'VE MADE A FLIMSY TAKE AND I'M

752
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,500
PROUD OF IT.

753
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,933
THE POINT IS, MARION HAMMER

754
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,933
PLAYED A BIG PART IN PASSING ONE

755
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,466
OF THE COUNTRY'S FIRST

756
00:19:57,533 --> 00:19:58,766
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS, IN

757
00:19:58,833 --> 00:19:59,033
FLORIDA.

758
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,533
AND THE PASSAGE OF THAT BILL WAS

759
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,500
IMMENSELY USEFUL TO THE NRA

760
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:02,800
BECAUSE IT BECAME A MODEL FOR

761
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:04,766
LAWS THEY COULD THEN PUSH AROUND

762
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:05,633
THE COUNTRY.

763
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,833
WAYNE LaPIERRE OPENLY SAID AT

764
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,566
THE TIME THAT FLORIDA WAS THE

765
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:09,713
FIRST STEP OF A MULTI-STATE

766
00:20:09,766 --> 00:20:10,700
STRATEGY, AND THEY WERE GOING TO

767
00:20:10,766 --> 00:20:11,909
USE THE TAILWIND TO MOVE FROM

768
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:13,566
STATE LEGISLATURE TO STATE

769
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:14,366
LEGISLATURE.

770
00:20:14,433 --> 00:20:17,366
AND THEY DID.

771
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:18,433
JUST SIX YEARS LATER,

772
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,800
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS HAD

773
00:20:19,866 --> 00:20:21,433
PASSED IN 22 STATES.

774
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,366
AND WHILE, FOLLOWING THE KILLING

775
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:24,266
OF TRAYVON MARTIN, THEY BECAME

776
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:29,966
INCREASINGLY CONTROVERSIAL,

777
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:30,866
STATES DID NOT STOP PASSING THE

778
00:20:30,933 --> 00:20:31,533
LAWS... THEY JUST SLIGHTLY

779
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:31,933
SLOWED DOWN.

780
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,142
AND DENNIS BAXLEY, ONE OF THE

781
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:33,800
STATE REPRESENTATIVES WHO HELPED

782
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:34,566
DRAFT FLORIDA'S BILL, WAS

783
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:35,642
ADAMANT THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE

784
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:36,700
ROLLED BACK.

785
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:37,766
WE SHOULD STAND BESIDE

786
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,000
LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS.

787
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:41,433
THEY SHOULD NOT BE TREATED AS A

788
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,833
CRIMINAL IF THEY'RE DOING

789
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,566
SOMETHING POSITIVE, WHICH IS

790
00:20:44,633 --> 00:20:46,366
STOPPING A VIOLENT ACT FROM

791
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:47,066
OCCURRING.

792
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:48,233
THERE ARE GONNA BE TIMES

793
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:48,900
WITH CLOSE CALLS NEAR THE

794
00:20:48,966 --> 00:20:49,533
FOUL LINE... IS IT IN OR IS IT

795
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:49,933
OUT?

796
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,900
WHO'S THE ASSAILANT AND WHO'S

797
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:51,733
THE VICTIM?

798
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,733
YEAH, THERE ARE GOING

799
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,700
TO BE SOME CLOSE CALLS.

800
00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:55,333
IS IT IN OR IS IT OUT?

801
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,833
IS IT RIGHT OR IS IT WRONG?

802
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,300
IS IT SELF-DEFENSE OR IS IT A

803
00:20:58,366 --> 00:20:59,733
MURDER PROVOKED BY A DEBATE

804
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,600
ABOUT HOW MUCH A DOG CAN WEIGH

805
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:01,800
THAT TURNED PHYSICAL?

806
00:21:01,866 --> 00:21:03,866
WHO CAN SAY?

807
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:07,400
NOT THAT GUY.

808
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,866
AND THAT IS A LITTLE BIT OF THE

809
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:10,566
POINT HERE.

810
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:11,566
THE WAY MOST STATES'

811
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:12,200
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS

812
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:13,276
ARE CONSTRUCTED, THEY CAN MAKE

813
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:13,833
DETERMINING QUESTIONS OF GUILT

814
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,000
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT.

815
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,366
BECAUSE IT ALL COMES DOWN TO

816
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:17,933
PERCEIVED FEAR... WHETHER YOU

817
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,333
LEGITIMATELY SAW SOMEONE AS A

818
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:19,933
THREAT... AND THAT IS

819
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,700
DEFINITIONALLY SUBJECTIVE.

820
00:21:22,766 --> 00:21:24,466
WHAT I'M AFRAID OF... SNAKES,

821
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,300
CLOWNS, AND TILDA SWINTON...

822
00:21:26,366 --> 00:21:27,933
JESUS CHRIST! MIGHT NOT BE

823
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,766
WHAT YOU ARE.

824
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,233
AND IT'S MADE EVEN HARDER BY THE

825
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:41,300
FACT THAT OFTEN, THE ONLY OTHER

826
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,133
PERSON WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED

827
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,800
IN THE INCIDENT IS DEAD.

828
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:46,433
AND CITING "STAND YOUR GROUND"

829
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,166
AS A LEGAL DEFENSE HAS BEEN

830
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:49,533
EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL.

831
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,609
IN FLORIDA ALONE, AS OF 2012,

832
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:52,500
NEARLY 70% OF PEOPLE WHO CLAIMED

833
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:53,800
IT AS A DEFENSE HAD GONE FREE.

834
00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:55,133
AND ADVOCATES FOR THESE LAWS

835
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,400
WILL TELL YOU THAT'S A GOOD

836
00:21:56,466 --> 00:21:57,000
THING... THAT BEFORE THEIR

837
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:57,866
INTRODUCTION, GOOD PEOPLE WERE

838
00:21:57,933 --> 00:21:58,566
GETTING SENT TO JAIL ALL THE

839
00:21:58,633 --> 00:21:59,633
TIME SIMPLY FOR DEFENDING

840
00:21:59,700 --> 00:21:59,966
THEMSELVES.

841
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:00,966
BUT THEY NEVER HAD MUCH IN THE

842
00:22:01,033 --> 00:22:01,633
WAY OF ACTUAL EVIDENCE FOR THAT

843
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,233
BEYOND HYPOTHETICALS LIKE

844
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,166
MARION HAMMER'S STORY ABOUT HOW

845
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:04,700
SOMEONE SAID SHE COULD HAVE GONE

846
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:06,733
TO JAIL, BUT CRUCIALLY, DIDN'T.

847
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,033
SO STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS

848
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,142
WEREN'T REALLY FIXING A PROBLEM

849
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,766
THAT NEEDED SOLVING.

850
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:12,700
AND THE DANGERS THEY POSED WERE

851
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:14,066
PRETTY OBVIOUS TO SOME FROM THE

852
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,866
START.

853
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:18,266
WHEN GEORGIA WAS DEBATING A

854
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,400
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAW IN 2006, A

855
00:22:20,466 --> 00:22:21,542
LOCAL STATION ASKED PEOPLE IN

856
00:22:21,566 --> 00:22:22,100
THE STREET WHAT THEY THOUGHT.

857
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:22,766
AND WATCH AS THEIR THIRD

858
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,533
INTERVIEWEE REALIZES SOMETHING

859
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
THE FIRST TWO DON'T.

860
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:28,800
I THINK IT'LL LOWER CRIME,

861
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:30,200
MYSELF.

862
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,733
'CAUSE A PERSON'S GONNA AND

863
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,633
TWICE ABOUT RUNNING UP ON A

864
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,966
CITIZEN IF HE THINKS THAT

865
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:35,633
CITIZEN'S ARMED.

866
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,366
IF YOU FEEL YOUR LIFE'S IN

867
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:37,000
DANGER, I THINK... I THINK IT'S

868
00:22:37,066 --> 00:22:37,466
A GOOD... A GOOD LAW.

869
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:38,100
I THINK IT'S GONNA GET A LOT

870
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:38,466
OF PEOPLE HURT.

871
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:39,600
WHY'S THAT?

872
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:40,946
WELL, BECAUSE WHEN YOU WALKED

873
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,500
UP TO ME IN A PARKING LOT, I

874
00:22:41,566 --> 00:22:45,000
DIDN'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE.

875
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:45,700
AND BY THIS LAW, IF I FELT THAT

876
00:22:45,766 --> 00:22:46,366
YOU THREATENED ME, I COULD HAVE

877
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:46,933
JUST SHOT YOU RIGHT NOW.

878
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,366
YOU KNOW?

879
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:48,933
I CAN'T... THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

880
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,176
YEAH, THAT LAST GUY IS

881
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,500
COMPLETELY RIGHT.

882
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:53,766
AND IN HINDSIGHT, MAYBE WE

883
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:54,842
SHOULDN'T HAVE LISTENED TO THE

884
00:22:54,866 --> 00:22:55,633
MAN IN THE "PRIDE OF THE SOUTH"

885
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,033
HAT, THAT, BY THE WAY, FEATURES

886
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,400
A PORTRAIT OF ROBERT E. LEE OVER

887
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:00,033
A CONFEDERATE FLAG.

888
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,700
THAT HAT ALONE SHOULD HAVE

889
00:23:00,766 --> 00:23:01,200
IMMEDIATELY DISQUALIFIED

890
00:23:01,266 --> 00:23:02,100
ANYTHING HE SAID.

891
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:04,000
IT'S LIKE IF ANTHONY FAUCI WORE

892
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:04,800
THIS BUCKET HAT THAT SAYS

893
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:06,066
"DADDY" IN THE "SHREK" FONT.

894
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:07,966
IF HE DID, YOU'D BE DUTY-BOUND

895
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:12,800
TO IGNORE ANYTHING HE SAID.

896
00:23:12,866 --> 00:23:14,333
'CAUSE THE FACT IS, WE NOW

897
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,333
KNOW, OVERALL, NOT ONLY DO

898
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,476
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS NOT DETER

899
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,700
CRIME, THEY MAY ACTUALLY

900
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:20,033
INCREASE VIOLENCE.

901
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,300
IN STAND-YOUR-GROUND STATES,

902
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:25,100
HOMICIDES OVERALL HAVE INCREASED

903
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,233
NEARLY 11% SINCE THE LAWS'

904
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,666
ENACTMENT, WHEREAS IN STATES

905
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:30,433
WITHOUT THOSE LAWS, THE HOMICIDE

906
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,066
RATE WENT DOWN BY JUST OVER 2%.

907
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:32,966
IN FACT, ANOTHER STUDY FOUND

908
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:34,400
SUCH LAWS TRANSLATE INTO AN

909
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:37,733
ADDITIONAL 600 HOMICIDES PER

910
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,433
YEAR.

911
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,366
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "WELL,

912
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:40,233
COME ON, YOU CAN'T DRAW A

913
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,380
STRAIGHT LINE BETWEEN THESE

914
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:42,700
SPECIFIC LAWS AND PEOPLE'S

915
00:23:42,766 --> 00:23:44,600
ACTIONS"... IN SOME CASES, YOU

916
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:45,906
VERY MUCH CAN, INCLUDING ONE OF

917
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:47,142
THE VERY FIRST STAND-YOUR-GROUND

918
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:49,300
CASES IN TEXAS, THAT OF JOE

919
00:23:49,366 --> 00:23:52,500
HORN, WHO CALLED 911 TO REPORT A

920
00:23:52,566 --> 00:23:53,766
BURGLARY HAPPENING DURING THE

921
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,333
DAY AT HIS NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR'S

922
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,533
HOUSE.

923
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,400
I'VE GOT A SHOTGUN.

924
00:23:58,466 --> 00:24:00,133
DO YOU WANT ME TO STOP HIM?

925
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,833
NOPE, DON'T DO THAT.

926
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,700
AIN'T NO PROPERTY WORTH SHOOTING

927
00:24:02,766 --> 00:24:04,466
SOMEBODY OVER, OKAY?

928
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:05,900
JOE HORN SOUNDS CLEARLY

929
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:09,933
UPSET.

930
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,600
I AM NOT GONNA LET THEM GET

931
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:11,233
AWAY WITH IT.

932
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,000
I CAN'T TAKE A CHANCE ON GETTING

933
00:24:12,066 --> 00:24:12,500
KILLED OVER THIS, OKAY?

934
00:24:12,566 --> 00:24:14,466
NO.

935
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:16,100
I'M GONNA SHOOT.

936
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,466
GONNA SHOOT.

937
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:19,100
BUT THE 911 DISPATCHER WARNS

938
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:19,900
HORN TO STAY INSIDE AT LEAST A

939
00:24:19,966 --> 00:24:20,366
DOZEN SEPARATE TIMES.

940
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:21,000
AN OFFICER IS COMING OUT

941
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:22,100
THERE.

942
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:23,666
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO OUTSIDE

943
00:24:23,733 --> 00:24:31,733
OF THAT HOUSE.

944
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,233
THEN HORN, SOUNDING ANGRIER

945
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:33,800
BY THE MOMENT, CITES THE NEW

946
00:24:33,866 --> 00:24:34,866
TEXAS LAW.

947
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:35,600
I HAVE A RIGHT TO PROTECT

948
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:36,100
MYSELF TOO, SIR AND YOU

949
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:36,600
UNDERSTAND THAT.

950
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:37,366
YES, YOU DO.

951
00:24:37,433 --> 00:24:37,666
YES, YOU DO.

952
00:24:37,733 --> 00:24:38,233
AND THE LAWS HAVE BEEN

953
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:38,833
CHANGED IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE

954
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,942
SEPTEMBER THE 1ST AND YOU KNOW

955
00:24:39,966 --> 00:24:40,533
IT AND I KNOW IT.

956
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,333
YEAH, JOE HORN KNEW

957
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:41,966
WHAT THE LAWS SAID, AND DESPITE

958
00:24:42,033 --> 00:24:42,566
THE DISPATCHER WARNING HIM NOT

959
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:44,733
TO GO OUTSIDE 14 TIMES, HE DID

960
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,333
JUST THAT AND KILLED TWO PEOPLE,

961
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,900
WITH AUTOPSY REPORTS LATER

962
00:24:47,966 --> 00:24:49,166
SHOWING THAT BOTH MEN APPEARED

963
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,700
TO HAVE BEEN SHOT IN THE BACK.

964
00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:53,400
HE WAS EXPLICITLY TOLD THAT

965
00:24:53,466 --> 00:24:54,476
PROPERTY IS NOT WORTH SHOOTING

966
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,266
PEOPLE OVER.

967
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,700
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY TRUE.

968
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:01,466
AND CERTAINLY NOT YOUR

969
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,800
NEIGHBOR'S PROPERTY.

970
00:25:03,866 --> 00:25:06,533
IF I FOUND OUT MY NEIGHBOR SHOT

971
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,900
AND KILLED TWO PEOPLE TO SAVE MY

972
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:09,300
PS5, I WOULD MOVE TOMORROW.

973
00:25:09,366 --> 00:25:10,100
I KNOW THEY'RE HARD TO GET YOUR

974
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,342
HANDS ON, BUT JESUS CHRIST, CALM

975
00:25:11,366 --> 00:25:13,266
DOWN.

976
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:15,233
I DON'T WANT YOUR BLOOD CONSOLE.

977
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:21,133
AND THANKS TO TEXAS' NEW

978
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,100
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS, JOE HORN

979
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:22,700
WAS NEVER ARRESTED.

980
00:25:22,766 --> 00:25:23,366
AND ULTIMATELY, A GRAND JURY

981
00:25:23,433 --> 00:25:24,133
DECLINED TO EVER CHARGE HIM WITH

982
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,266
A CRIME.

983
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:27,333
AND NOT ONLY WAS HORN SPARED ANY

984
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,433
CONSEQUENCES, HE WAS LATER

985
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,066
CELEBRATED AS A HERO.

986
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:32,033
YOU HAD 911 ON AND YOU SAID,

987
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,566
I'M GONNA GO STOP THEM.

988
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:33,166
YOU GOTTA GET HERE, I'M GONNA

989
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:33,466
STOP THEM.

990
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:34,100
THEY SAID, NO, NO, NO, DON'T GO

991
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:34,666
OUT.

992
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,233
YOU... YOU STOPPED THEM.

993
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,300
THEY CAME TOWARDS YOU.

994
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:38,566
YOU SHOT THEM, RIGHT?

995
00:25:38,633 --> 00:25:39,033
YES, SIR.

996
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,881
THAT'S CORRECT.

997
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:42,833
OKAY.

998
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,433
SET ASIDE THAT JOE HORN LOOKS

999
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,600
LIKE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF

1000
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:46,233
BOBBY HILL GREW UP AND SUCKED.

1001
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,866
THE ONLY TIME IT'S APPROPRIATE

1002
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:47,466
TO CHEER AFTER SOMEONE SAYS "YOU

1003
00:25:47,533 --> 00:25:48,100
SHOT THEM" IS IF YOU'RE TALKING

1004
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:48,733
ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBLE

1005
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,033
FOR SHOOTING THIS VIDEO OF A

1006
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,900
FAMILY OF BEARS IN A SWIMMING

1007
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,100
POOL.

1008
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:53,242
"YOU SAW THE BEARS,

1009
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:54,600
YOU HAD YOUR PHONE READY, AND

1010
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:56,400
YOU SHOT THEM, RIGHT?"

1011
00:25:56,466 --> 00:25:56,933
"YES, SIR, THAT'S

1012
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,966
CORRECT."

1013
00:26:00,033 --> 00:26:00,566
CUE THE FUCKING APPLAUSE.

1014
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:01,700
NO OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES.

1015
00:26:01,766 --> 00:26:02,433
NONE.

1016
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,700
AND IF THESE LAWS ON THEIR OWN

1017
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:06,066
WEREN'T BAD ENOUGH, THERE IS NOW

1018
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:08,000
ALSO A SMALL COTTAGE INDUSTRY

1019
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,833
THAT'S CROPPED UP AROUND THEM

1020
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,100
SELLING SPECIALIZED SELF-DEFENSE

1021
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:14,066
LEGAL ASSISTANCE.

1022
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:15,276
MOST OF THESE COMPANIES OFFER

1023
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:15,933
MEMBERSHIP PACKAGES INCLUDING

1024
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,500
EVERYTHING FROM EDUCATIONAL

1025
00:26:16,566 --> 00:26:17,066
TRAINING VIDEOS TO MONEY FOR

1026
00:26:17,133 --> 00:26:18,933
FUTURE LEGAL DEFENSE AND BOND.

1027
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,733
THE U.S. CONCEALED CARRY

1028
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
ASSOCIATION INSISTS IT'S

1029
00:26:20,866 --> 00:26:22,366
PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH

1030
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:23,366
TEACHING CONFLICT AVOIDANCE, BUT

1031
00:26:23,433 --> 00:26:25,000
IT ALSO GIVES YOU A WALLET-SIZED

1032
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:26,209
CARD WITH TIPS ON HOW TO HANDLE

1033
00:26:26,233 --> 00:26:28,633
THE CALL YOU MAKE TO POLICE

1034
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,233
AFTER YOU'VE SHOT SOMEONE, A

1035
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,633
HANDY FEATURE THEIR FOUNDER

1036
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,500
PROUDLY TOUTS TO MEMBERS.

1037
00:26:34,566 --> 00:26:36,533
THIS IS MY VERY OWN USCCA

1038
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,066
CARD.

1039
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:37,800
YOU CAN SEE MY NAME ON IT,

1040
00:26:37,866 --> 00:26:39,009
TIM SCHMIDT, RIGHT ON THE BACK

1041
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:40,333
OF THE CARD.

1042
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,033
IT ACTUALLY LISTS THE EXACT

1043
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:41,900
INSTRUCTIONS FOR WHAT TO SAY TO

1044
00:26:41,966 --> 00:26:43,366
A RESPONDING OFFICER.

1045
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:45,266
EXPLAIN I WAS ATTACKED, I FEARED

1046
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:46,066
FOR MY LIFE, AND I HAD TO DEFEND

1047
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:47,766
MYSELF.

1048
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:49,166
OKAY, SETTING ASIDE THE

1049
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,400
FACT THAT LOOKS LIKE THE MOST

1050
00:26:50,466 --> 00:26:53,333
BORING EPISODE OF "SPORTSCENTER"

1051
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,733
IMAGINABLE, IT FEELS IMPORTANT

1052
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,533
TO POINT OUT THEY'VE ESSENTIALLY

1053
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,800
CREATED A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE

1054
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:57,566
CARD.

1055
00:26:57,633 --> 00:26:58,809
AND THAT MIXED WITH THAT MAN'S

1056
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:01,766
GET OUT OF JAIL FREE COMPLEXION

1057
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:03,900
IS A PRETTY AWFUL COMBINATION.

1058
00:27:03,966 --> 00:27:05,900
AND AT LEAST ONE OF USCCA'S

1059
00:27:05,966 --> 00:27:07,100
CLIENTS APPARENTLY TOOK THE

1060
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:08,066
ADVICE ON THAT CARD AND RAN WITH

1061
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,500
CARLOS GARCIA'S EX-WIFE,

1062
00:27:11,566 --> 00:27:13,300
YAILEEN AYALA, PAINTS HIM AS A

1063
00:27:13,366 --> 00:27:14,266
LOVING FATHER WHO WOULD DO

1064
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:17,033
ANYTHING FOR HIS CHILDREN.

1065
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,400
SHE BELIEVES HE WAS INTOXICATED

1066
00:27:18,466 --> 00:27:19,476
WHEN HE SHOWED UP TO PICK UP HIS

1067
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,100
KIDS AND GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT

1068
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:22,566
WITH THE NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,

1069
00:27:22,633 --> 00:27:23,909
NICK JULIAN IV, OVER HIM PLAYING

1070
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,433
LOUD MUSIC IN THE CAR.

1071
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,033
JULIAN ARMED HIMSELF WITH A

1072
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,666
HANDGUN AND SHOT GARCIA, HE

1073
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,633
CLAIMS IN SELF-DEFENSE.

1074
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,533
NEIGHBORS CAME OUT AS JULIAN IV

1075
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,333
WAS ON WITH 911.

1076
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,133
911, WHAT IS YOUR

1077
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,266
EMERGENCY?

1078
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:40,342
YES, MA'AM, I JUST HAD A MAN

1079
00:27:40,366 --> 00:27:43,600
ATTACK ME IN MY FRONT YARD.

1080
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:44,533
HE ATTACKED ME AND I HAD TO USE

1081
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,933
FORCE.

1082
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,266
I WAS AFRAID FOR MY LIFE.

1083
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,342
YEAH, IT SEEMS ALL YOU

1084
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:50,476
HAVE TO DO IS MEMORIZE A FEW KEY

1085
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,733
PHRASES AND YOU TOO COULD BE

1086
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,909
FREE TO SHOOT WITH IMPUNITY.

1087
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:55,109
IT'S BASICALLY ROSETTA STONE FOR

1088
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:56,800
JUSTIFIED HOMICIDES, BECAUSE

1089
00:27:56,866 --> 00:27:58,076
DURING HIS 911 CALL, NICK JULIAN

1090
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,700
MADE SURE TO SAY THAT HE FEARED

1091
00:27:59,766 --> 00:28:02,133
FOR HIS LIFE THREE SEPARATE

1092
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,233
TIMES AND CAN ALSO BE HEARD

1093
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,342
REFERRING TO HIS WALLET AND

1094
00:28:05,366 --> 00:28:07,033
SAYING TO SOMEONE, "YOU JUST

1095
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,066
NEED TO CALL THEM, GIVE THEM THE

1096
00:28:09,133 --> 00:28:10,866
ACCOUNT NUMBER AND MY ATTORNEY."

1097
00:28:10,933 --> 00:28:12,233
AND BY THE TIME THE POLICE

1098
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,500
ARRIVED, HE WAS ALREADY ON THE

1099
00:28:14,566 --> 00:28:15,709
PHONE WITH THE U.S. CONCEALED

1100
00:28:15,733 --> 00:28:20,333
CARRY ASSOCIATION SETTING UP HIS

1101
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,433
LEGAL DEFENSE BEFORE HIS VICTIM

1102
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,666
HAD EVEN BEEN DECLARED DEAD.

1103
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:24,876
AND I KNOW IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE

1104
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,833
THESE LAWS ARE JUST A

1105
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,433
FREE-FOR-ALL TO SHOOT SOMEONE

1106
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,200
WHO SCARES YOU.

1107
00:28:27,266 --> 00:28:28,900
BUT THE TRUTH IS, THERE ARE SOME

1108
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:30,033
LIMITS.

1109
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,142
AND YOU PROBABLY KNOW WHERE THIS

1110
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:32,300
IS GOING.

1111
00:28:32,366 --> 00:28:33,166
BECAUSE WHILE MOST SHOOTINGS

1112
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:33,833
INVOLVE PEOPLE OF THE SAME RACE,

1113
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,733
WHEN CASES INVOLVE SHOOTINGS

1114
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,842
ACROSS RACIAL LINES, THERE ARE

1115
00:28:35,866 --> 00:28:37,366
SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES IN WHOSE

1116
00:28:37,433 --> 00:28:38,200
FEAR GETS BELIEVED.

1117
00:28:38,266 --> 00:28:40,433
BECAUSE THE ODDS A

1118
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,066
WHITE-ON-BLACK HOMICIDE WAS

1119
00:28:44,133 --> 00:28:45,533
DEEMED JUSTIFIED BY THE POLICE

1120
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,966
WERE 281% GREATER THAN THE ODDS

1121
00:28:47,033 --> 00:28:48,800
A WHITE-ON-WHITE HOMICIDE WAS.

1122
00:28:48,866 --> 00:28:51,633
AND THE EXPANSION OF

1123
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,233
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS HAVE

1124
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:53,933
APPEARED TO WORSEN THAT

1125
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,040
DISPARITY, A FACT THAT I'M

1126
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,033
PRETTY SURE WOULD SURPRISE

1127
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,166
EXACTLY TWO OF THESE THREE MEN.

1128
00:28:58,233 --> 00:29:00,733
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THERE ARE

1129
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,300
MULTIPLE EXAMPLES WHERE YOU

1130
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:02,166
WOULD THINK, IF EVER A

1131
00:29:02,233 --> 00:29:04,166
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAW WOULD

1132
00:29:04,233 --> 00:29:05,866
APPLY, THIS WOULD BE THE CASE...

1133
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:07,833
AND YET, IT DIDN'T.

1134
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,033
TAKE SIWATU-SALAMA RA, WHO WAVED

1135
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,380
AN UNLOADED, REGISTERED GUN AT A

1136
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:13,266
WOMAN WHO SHE BELIEVED WAS

1137
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:15,533
TRYING TO HIT HER AND HER YOUNG

1138
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,266
DAUGHTER WITH HER CAR.

1139
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:21,300
BUT EVEN THOUGH HER STATE OF

1140
00:29:21,366 --> 00:29:22,700
MICHIGAN HAS A STAND-YOUR-GROUND

1141
00:29:22,766 --> 00:29:24,600
LAW, AND EVEN THOUGH THAT

1142
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:25,533
INCIDENT CLEARLY FALLS UNDER A

1143
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,300
REASONABLE DEFINITION OF

1144
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:26,866
SELF-DEFENSE WITHOUT IT, AND

1145
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:27,766
EVEN THOUGH SHE DIDN'T EVEN

1146
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:28,400
SHOOT THE GUN BECAUSE, AGAIN, IT

1147
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:29,800
WAS UNLOADED, SHE WAS

1148
00:29:29,866 --> 00:29:31,300
SENTENCED TO TWO YEARS ON THE

1149
00:29:31,366 --> 00:29:32,933
CHARGE OF USING A GUN TO COMMIT

1150
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,300
A FELONY.

1151
00:29:34,366 --> 00:29:35,766
AND WHILE, AFTER OUTCRY, SHE

1152
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:37,073
WAS EVENTUALLY ABLE TO PLEAD TO

1153
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:38,000
A LESSER CHARGE, THAT WASN'T

1154
00:29:38,066 --> 00:29:39,076
BEFORE SHE'D SPENT A YEAR IN

1155
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,100
PRISON.

1156
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:41,666
AND SHE WAS PREGNANT AT THE TIME

1157
00:29:41,733 --> 00:29:43,033
AND WAS FORCED TO BIRTH IN

1158
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,100
SHACKLES.

1159
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:46,666
SO DESPITE BEING INTRODUCED TO

1160
00:29:46,733 --> 00:29:48,000
INCREASE SAFETY,

1161
00:29:48,066 --> 00:29:49,833
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS ACTUALLY

1162
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,866
INCREASE VIOLENCE.

1163
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:53,433
AND GIVEN AROUND FOUR CENTURIES

1164
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,133
OF HISTORY, BASING A LAW AROUND

1165
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,333
"WHO'S AFRAID OF WHO" WAS ALWAYS

1166
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,966
GOING TO BE DANGEROUS.

1167
00:30:00,033 --> 00:30:01,566
IT'S THE REASON OHIO STATE

1168
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,566
LEGISLATOR STEPHANIE HOWSE STOOD

1169
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:04,200
UP TO OPPOSE HER STATE PASSING

1170
00:30:04,266 --> 00:30:05,666
ITS STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAW BACK

1171
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:09,733
WHEN YOUR PRESENCE, WHEN YOUR

1172
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,066
BEING, YOUR BLACKNESS CAUSES

1173
00:30:13,133 --> 00:30:14,533
FEAR... DO YOU HEAR WHAT I'M

1174
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,233
SAYING?

1175
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,166
I'VE BEEN IN THESE... THESE

1176
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,266
FLOORS WHERE I HEAR PEOPLE TELL

1177
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:21,800
ME, "YOU KNOW PEOPLE SCARED OF

1178
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:25,766
YOU."

1179
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:27,866
IT'S PEOPLE I HAVE NEVER

1180
00:30:27,933 --> 00:30:29,500
INTERACTED WITH.

1181
00:30:29,566 --> 00:30:31,366
WHAT DO YOU DO IN PLACES AND

1182
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:34,466
SPACES WHEN YOUR PRESENCE...

1183
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:36,100
LITERALLY YOUR FACE, YOUR FACE

1184
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:36,800
CAUSES SOMEONE TO BE FEARFUL OF

1185
00:30:36,866 --> 00:30:37,566
YOU?

1186
00:30:37,633 --> 00:30:38,466
THIS IS A BAD IDEA FOR PEOPLE

1187
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:41,033
THAT LOOK LIKE ME.

1188
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,166
EXACTLY.

1189
00:30:42,233 --> 00:30:43,600
THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE THINGS

1190
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:44,666
THAT MAKES THESE LAWS SO

1191
00:30:44,733 --> 00:30:45,600
DANGEROUS.

1192
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:47,300
THEY CAN EXALT A WHITE PERSON'S

1193
00:30:47,366 --> 00:30:49,600
FEAR OVER A BLACK PERSON'S LIFE

1194
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:51,500
AND ARE APPLIED SO UNEVENLY THAT

1195
00:30:51,566 --> 00:30:52,676
SIWATU-SALAMA RA GAVE BIRTH IN

1196
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,933
SHACKLES WHILE THIS GUY GETS A

1197
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,066
FUCKING PARADE.

1198
00:30:57,133 --> 00:30:58,666
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS HAVE

1199
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:00,466
CONTRIBUTED TO A SOCIETY WHERE

1200
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:01,933
VIGILANTES WITH GUNS FEEL THEY

1201
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,300
HAVE TO RIGHT TO DECIDE WHAT IS

1202
00:31:03,366 --> 00:31:04,166
SAFETY, WHO IS A THREAT, AND

1203
00:31:04,233 --> 00:31:05,276
WHAT THE PUNISHMENT SHOULD BE.

1204
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,100
THEY'VE TURBO-CHARGED EVERYTHING

1205
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:08,400
FROM ROAD-RAGE INCIDENTS TO

1206
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,133
POINTLESS DISPUTES OVER DOG

1207
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,466
WEIGHTS.

1208
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:16,933
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

1209
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,533
WELL, THE ANSWER IS ACTUALLY

1210
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,133
PRETTY SIMPLE.

1211
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,033
DON'T PASS ANY MORE

1212
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:19,700
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS AND

1213
00:31:19,766 --> 00:31:21,500
REPEAL THE ONES THAT DO EXIST.

1214
00:31:21,566 --> 00:31:22,433
THEY'RE REDUNDANT SOLUTIONS TO A

1215
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,576
MADE-UP PROBLEM, AND THEY'RE

1216
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,800
ACTIVELY DOING HARM.

1217
00:31:25,866 --> 00:31:27,026
IN THE PAST YEAR, AT LEAST 14

1218
00:31:27,066 --> 00:31:28,600
BILLS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN

1219
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:29,800
FIVE STATES TO ROLL THEIR

1220
00:31:29,866 --> 00:31:31,100
STAND-YOUR-GROUND LAWS BACK.

1221
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:32,400
AND IF YOU LIVE IN A

1222
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:33,766
STAND-YOUR-GROUND STATE,

1223
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:35,042
ESPECIALLY ONE WHERE THOSE BILLS

1224
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:37,566
HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED, YOU SHOULD

1225
00:31:37,633 --> 00:31:40,233
ABSOLUTELY WRITE TO YOUR

1226
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,540
REPRESENTATIVES TO URGE THEM TO

1227
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,933
REPEAL THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

1228
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,033
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, IF YOU

1229
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:46,933
LIVE IN FLORIDA... OR, FUCK IT,

1230
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,200
ANY STATE... IN THE INTERESTS OF

1231
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:50,466
ANNOYING MARION HAMMER, MAYBE

1232
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:54,233
ALSO DEMAND THEY MAKE YOUR STATE

1233
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,000
BIRD THE FLORIDA SCRUB JAY, SO

1234
00:31:55,066 --> 00:31:55,866
IT CAN DELIVER ITS FERGILICIOUS

1235
00:31:55,933 --> 00:31:57,300
VICTORY SONG.

1236
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:06,266
THAT'S A B-PLUS BIRD.

1237
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:07,033
THAT BIRD IS FINE.

1238
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:07,933
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

1239
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,500
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

1240
00:32:09,566 --> 00:32:10,133
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

1241
00:32:10,233 --> 00:32:11,533
GOOD NIGHT.
