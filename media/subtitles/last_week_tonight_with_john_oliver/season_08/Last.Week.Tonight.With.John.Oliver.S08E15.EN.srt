00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,760
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,800
Hi there ! Welcome to the show !
Still coming from this blank void,

3
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,160
entertainment's most upsetting
bastion of whiteness,

4
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,080
not counting the Hollywood
Foreign Press Association.

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,800
It's been another busy week.
Biden met with G7 leaders,

6
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,960
Jeff Bezos announced
he'll be heading to space

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,680
on the world's
first circumcised spacecraft,

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,440
and an internet conspiracy
about people becoming magnetic

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,240
after getting vaccinated
turned up at the Ohio State House.

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,400
We were talking
about Dr. Tenpenny's testimony

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,760
about magnetic vaccine crystals.

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,800
This is what I found out.
I have a key and a bobby pin here.

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,920
Explain to me
why the key sticks to me.

14
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,400
It sticks to my neck, too.

15
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,560
If somebody can explain this,
that would be great.

16
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,160
I can try to explain what this is.

17
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,560
Very basically, public education
is horribly underfunded

18
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,400
and scientific literacy is nowhere
near what it should be in this country,

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,120
creating a vacuum
of trust in legitimate research.

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,360
Meanwhile, people tend to try to seek
out the minimum amount of information

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,960
that lets them keep believing
what they already believe,

22
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,440
in your case,
that you're privy to secret knowledge

23
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,680
about a government conspiracy
to magnetize the people of Ohio.

24
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,600
All of that is probably why you felt
confident enough to trust some bullshit

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,080
that you read online so much
that you were willing to look

26
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,000
like a complete asshole
in front of all those people.

27
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,240
And if you just meant the key thing,
people are sometimes sticky.

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,000
We're all kind of moist and gross
and keys stick to us sometimes.

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,680
That's it.

30
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,040
In New York, the news has been
dominated by the race for mayor.

31
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,080
Early voting in the primaries
started yesterday,

32
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,000
and, for the first time,
the city's using ranked choice voting,

33
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,720
something the mayor chose to explain
by imagining a pizza topping election.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,440
Green peppers, ladies and gentleman,
right here, my number one choice.

35
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,840
A lot of people don't appreciate
green peppers enough.

36
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,000
Number two: olives, okay ?
This one's a little controversial.

37
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,400
Usually it's black olives,
could be green olives,

38
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,320
some people think olives belong
on a pizza, some people are against it,

39
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,440
but I have had very good experiences
with olives.

40
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,720
That is unhinged. Green peppers
as your number one choice ?

41
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,000
Green peppers
aren't even my number one pepper.

42
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,080
They're just unripe red ones.

43
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,480
There isn't a green pepper character
in the VeggieTales universe,

44
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,280
because they disprove
the existence of a loving God.

45
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,200
And your second choice
there is olives ? On a pizza ?

46
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,800
That you plan to eat with your mouth ?
Unacceptable, Bill !

47
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,680
The race for the Democratic nominee
is very much in flux.

48
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,360
Maya Wiley has been shoring up
progressive support,

49
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,000
while a consistent frontrunner,
former police officer Eric Adams,

50
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,280
had to defend himself this week
from a pretty unusual attack.

51
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,960
Democrat Eric Adams,

52
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,920
a leading contender
in New York City's mayoral race,

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,360
today insisting
he really does live in New York.

54
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,080
This is our small,
humble kitchen.

55
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,440
Taking reporters
on a tour of his Brooklyn pad

56
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,040
after a Politico piece
raised questions

57
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,080
about whether other tenants
were really living in the apartment,

58
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,120
if Adams is spending his time

59
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,200
at a property he owns
with his partner in New Jersey,

60
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,200
or if his home
is actually his office.

61
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,640
Eric Adams had to give reporters
a tour of a Brooklyn apartment

62
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,280
to prove that he lived there,
and not in New Jersey.

63
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,840
Which already doesn't look good.

64
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,800
Partly because
he attacked Andrew Yang

65
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,400
for leaving the city
during the pandemic.

66
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,640
And partly because his argument that
he lives in that basement apartment

67
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,680
raises many more questions
than it answers.

68
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,000
Twitter detectives
flagged inconsistencies,

69
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,400
like the fact that, in 2017,
Adams tweeted a photograph

70
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,360
of his "hashtag plant-based fridge"
in "hashtag Bed-Stuy."

71
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:09,200
On this week's tour, that plant-based
fridge was nowhere to be found.

72
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,160
Because this was the fridge
in the apartment,

73
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,000
which you might notice
prominently features salmon,

74
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,520
something Adams claims belongs
to his son, who lives there with him.

75
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,360
Although everything
about that apartment,

76
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,600
from the decor to the fridge,
suggests it's his son who lives there,

77
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,200
and Adams who might
occasionally stay with him.

78
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,920
Is this the most important thing ?
No, not really.

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,880
But it is weird, and the way he's
choosing to handle it is even weirder.

80
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,960
And the thing is, that's not even the
strangest house tour Adams has given.

81
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,680
Because as a state senator in 2011,
he released this video teaching parents

82
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,480
how to search for contraband
that their kids might be hiding.

83
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,760
A jewelry box of this nature
may be a simple jewelry box,

84
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,280
but if you look through it closely,

85
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,320
you don't know
what your child may be hiding.

86
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,680
For instance,
a gun could be hidden.

87
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,840
A small-caliber weapon could be
hidden inside a jewelry box.

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,720
When your child bring in his popular
knapsack with many different locations,

89
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,920
look through it to see
what exactly is your child carrying,

90
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,640
in addition to a book.

91
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,840
Something simple as a crack
pipe, a used crack pipe.

92
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,600
Behind a picture frame,
you could find bullets.

93
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,480
A baby doll-could be
just a baby doll,

94
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,320
but also it could be a place
where you could secrete or hide drugs.

95
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,520
Honestly, that is all great, from
the bullets behind the picture frame,

96
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,000
to the "popular knapsack",
to the weird music.

97
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,000
But I want to focus
on the doll there.

98
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,200
Because what does Eric Adams
think a child is ?

99
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,000
In his scenario, your child is young
enough to be playing with baby dolls,

100
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,600
yet also,
old enough to be doing drugs.

101
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,200
What year of life encompasses
both those activities ?

102
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,520
Six and a half ? Maybe ?

103
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,640
Eric Adams is clearly a very odd man.
But he's not alone in that.

104
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,040
One of his closest rivals is Andrew
Yang, the answer to the question,

105
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,600
"What if the concept of 'dabbing'
was a person ?",

106
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,200
who on National Pets Day, posted,
"Celebrating our dog Grizzly

107
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,160
who we raised as a puppy
but had to give away

108
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,920
because one of our boys
became allergic to him.

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,640
Miss you Grizz !
'Hashtag dogs-for-yang'."

110
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,720
If you gave away your dog, you can
not post anything on National Pets Day.

111
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,120
Even if you have a dog,
you don't have to post anything.

112
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,800
Your dog's not gonna care
either way.

113
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,280
Dogs don't know what Twitter is,
it's why they're happy.

114
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,000
And other candidates have been
fucking up some pretty basic questions.

115
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,400
As the New York Times
grilled the candidates,

116
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,760
some were stumped when asked if they
could name the median purchase price

117
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,320
of a home in Brooklyn.

118
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,920
Ray McGuire,
a banking executive, said,

119
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,000
"It's got to be somewhere in the
80,000 to $90,000 range if not higher."

120
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,560
And Shaun Donovan,
former Federal Housing Secretary,

121
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,240
he said, "In Brooklyn, huh ?
I don't know for sure.

122
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,040
I would guess it's around $100,000."

123
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,360
You guessed wrong ! Because
the number is actually $900,000 !

124
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,960
Which is a real problem.

125
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,480
Because if these guys want to run a
city with an affordable housing crisis,

126
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,960
they might want to look
at the top Zillow search result

127
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,880
for "Brooklyn homes on sale
for less than $100,000,"

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,080
which is this empty lot that looks like
the setting of a filthy pigeon orgy.

129
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,960
But if some candidates
have seemed out-of-touch,

130
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,840
others have seemed
a little too eager to share.

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,080
When New York Magazine

132
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,120
asked the candidates about
the items they can't live without,

133
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,880
Republican Fernando Mateo

134
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,240
offered up, "Quilted Northern
Ultra Plush Toilet Paper,"

135
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,760
explaining, "I have big, strong hands,

136
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,040
so I need toilet paper that won't break
when I'm wiping my butt."

137
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,600
And that is already great.

138
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,440
It's funny, it's candid,
and he says, "wiping my butt."

139
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,000
It's excellent. But he didn't stop.
Because he continued,

140
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,640
"This has that toughness, but it's soft
enough for my sensitive areas."

141
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Already, something that started as
a puff-piece about favorite products,

142
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,760
has turned into Mateo forcing you
to think about his sensitive anus.

143
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,240
And he closes strong, saying,
"I've used other toilet paper

144
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,440
and my hand has ripped
right through it; it's a mess.

145
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,280
I wrap the paper around my hand
a few times just so it doesn't break."

146
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,000
And come on !
Now we're in an existential tragedy.

147
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,840
He's like Lennie Small
or Frankenstein's monster,

148
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,680
a physical behemoth
enraptured by the lure of soft beauty,

149
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,920
but sadly, these cursed brute hands
know only destruction.

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,600
It's just magnificent.

151
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,520
If Mateo doesn't get elected mayor,

152
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,480
he'd at least make a much
better toilet paper spokesperson

153
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,840
than those weird shitting bears.

154
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,400
If you're thinking,

155
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,680
"There sure are a lot of weirdos
running for Mayor of New York."

156
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,160
Of course there are.
Because being a weirdo in this city

157
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,520
isn't a disqualifier,
it's a prerequisite.

158
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,440
Think about it: our last three mayors
were 9/11 Nosferatu,

159
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,720
a billionaire elf, and the goober
that you just saw say out loud,

160
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,680
"I have had very good experiences
with olives."

161
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,960
Weird is kind of a job
requirement here.

162
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,680
While it would be great if candidates
could be good at other stuff as well,

163
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,520
there's no denying
that the New York Mayor's Office

164
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,080
isn't just an opportunity
for innovative leadership,

165
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,640
it's also a calling to spend at least
four years as the weird person on TV

166
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,320
everyone gets mad
at for eating pizza wrong.

167
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,960
And now, this !

168
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,000
And now...

169
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,360
Someone Please Stop Stuart Varney
From Saying This.

170
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,800
Come back to this show
any time you like, okay, Tomi ?

171
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,480
It's my favorite show,
I hope to be back soon.

172
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,280
Flattery is the mother's milk
of television.

173
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,240
Flattery is the mother's milk
of television.

174
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,840
I'll have you know that Scott Shellady,
don't you ever forget it, lad.

175
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,920
And flattery is the mother's milk
of television.

176
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,840
Let me tell you something, flattery
is the mother's milk of television.

177
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,520
Flattery is the mother's milk
of television, or so I'm told.

178
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,280
Flattery is the mother's milk
of television.

179
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Flattery is the mother's milk
of television...

180
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,040
Flattery is the mother's milk of
television, and that's very good stuff.

181
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,520
Flattery is the mother's milk
of television.

182
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,520
By the way, flattery
is the mother's milk of television,

183
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,080
and that is absolutely wonderful.

184
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,480
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns the fact that summer's here !

185
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,720
It's been getting hotter and hotter
outside, so we thought,

186
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,520
"Why not take a break
and have some summer fun ?

187
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,680
We're allowed to have
some summer fun, right ?"

188
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,160
So tonight,
we're going to talk about popsicles !

189
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,880
There are tons of them in America !

190
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,480
And when they get too hot,
it can be a real problem !

191
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,560
Sorry, did I say popsicles ?
I meant prisons.

192
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,040
We're going to talk about prisons.
There are tons of them in America.

193
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,000
And when they get too hot,
it can be a real problem.

194
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,480
Don't act surprised.
You knew no fun was happening here.

195
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,440
You remember what our "summer fun"
episode was this time last year ?

196
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,080
Voting by mail.

197
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,680
Don't be mad at me, be mad
at yourself, you chose to be here.

198
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,320
And look, the fact is,
heat in prisons is a big problem.

199
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,240
We've talked repeatedly about
the injustices of mass incarceration,

200
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,880
and how little society seems to care.

201
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,760
And a pretty good example of that

202
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,520
is the fact that in some of the hottest
areas of the country, these states,

203
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,960
over half the prisons lack air
conditioning in their housing areas.

204
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,440
And in Texas, that's the case
in nearly 75% of their prisons.

205
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,080
And that is not good,
because in summer,

206
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,520
the heat index inside of them
can hit 150 degrees !

207
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,280
Plus, there is a growing
population of older prisoners,

208
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,720
whose age makes them more
susceptible to the heat.

209
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,520
And over 40% of incarcerated people
have a chronic medical condition,

210
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,680
raising their risk of heat stroke.

211
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,760
So, a lot of them worry about what
happens when the weather turns hot.

212
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,640
I have heart disease,
high blood pressure, diabetes.

213
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,960
That's three conditions
that even TDC admits

214
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,960
could make a person susceptible
to extreme heat conditions.

215
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,320
My heart has to work
a whole lot harder

216
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,200
than the average guy
just to try to cool my body down.

217
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,640
And as a result,
I suffer from extreme chest pains.

218
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,880
On days where it's extremely hot,
I get sick real fast.

219
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,280
That is remarkably dangerous.

220
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,640
I'd argue that the only time getting
murdered by the heat is acceptable

221
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,520
is if you've committed
the crime of being a lobster.

222
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,560
But unless you happen to be a tasty
sea weirdo with edible arms

223
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,200
and a pile of scrumptious ass meat that
pairs beautifully with melted butter,

224
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,880
I'm gonna say
that that is very wrong.

225
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,800
And physical conditions
are just one part of this.

226
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,600
Prisons house an increasing number
of people with mental health concerns

227
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,000
who require medications

228
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,080
that can compromise their body's
ability to regulate temperature.

229
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,040
So, many avoid taking their medications
when it's hot,

230
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,800
which may explain why there is

231
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,360
"an increase in the frequency of suicide
watches and self-harm behaviors

232
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,960
during the summer months."

233
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,000
This situation is so bad,
the U.N. committee against torture

234
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,080
has expressed particular concern
about deaths from heat exposure

235
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,880
in prison facilities in Texas.

236
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,080
And while you probably
assumed Texas prisons were bad,

237
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,760
maybe not "international
human-rights watch list" bad.

238
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,040
And just to get this out of the way
right at the start:

239
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,360
If anyone is thinking,

240
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,240
"Come on, it's prison, these criminals
should not be comfortable."

241
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,280
First, fuck you. They're human beings
who, I would argue,

242
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,000
deserve humane treatment
regardless of what they did.

243
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,360
But even if you are fully on-board

244
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,400
with our current system of punitive
justice on a ridiculous scale,

245
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,560
you should know, even some
of those upholding this system

246
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,280
find the current situation
indefensible.

247
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,360
Just listen to the former head
of one correctional officer's union,

248
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,400
I don't have love for these people.

249
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,960
We're not trying to make this lush
and we're trying to make it humane.

250
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,040
These are third-world conditions,

251
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,760
we're supposed to run prisons,
not concentration camps,

252
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,800
these are institutions
for incarceration.

253
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,880
The incarceration is their punishment,
not cooking them to death.

254
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,800
Right. And just take a moment
to absorb the sentence,

255
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,760
"we're supposed to run prisons,
not concentration camps."

256
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,880
If someone helping to run a system
is comparing it to a concentration camp,

257
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,600
things have gotten way out of hand.

258
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,800
If someone said,

259
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,720
"We're supposed to run a Quiznos,
not a concentration camp,"

260
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,560
you would question what the fuck
is going on at that Quiznos.

261
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,680
So tonight,
let's talk about heat in prisons.

262
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,440
Let's start
with the obvious question here.

263
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,160
If prisons are too hot,
which clearly many are,

264
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,680
why not put in air conditioning ?

265
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,400
And that does seem
like a pretty easy fix !

266
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,400
But whenever it's brought up,
lawmakers and prison officials

267
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,160
have claimed
that they simply cannot afford it.

268
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,040
Although, when making that argument,
they've occasionally been

269
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,080
slightly more honest
than they were perhaps planning to be,

270
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,160
like when this Texas state senator
appeared on local radio.

271
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,960
We can talk about this all day,
it's not gonna change.

272
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,000
The prisons are hot.
They're uncomfortable.

273
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,320
The solution is don't commit a crime
and you stay at home and be cool.

274
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,360
We're not gonna air condition them.
One, we don't want to.

275
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,640
Number two,
we couldn't afford it if we wanted to.

276
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,640
Hold on there. Let's back up
to number one, shall we ?

277
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,240
"We don't want to."

278
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,600
Because after you say that, it doesn't
really matter what you say next.

279
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,920
If people don't care
about fixing a problem,

280
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,760
they're just not going to fix it,
however simple the solution is.

281
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,200
It's why your software update
still interrupts you every single day.

282
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,000
You could click on the alert and follow
the basic steps to make the updates.

283
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,400
But have you done that ?
Of course not ! Why ?

284
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,240
Because you could not give
one single, solitary fuck.

285
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,040
It seems that Texas really doesn't want
to put in air conditioning.

286
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,600
It actually spent 7 million dollars
on a lawsuit

287
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,400
to fight installing A.C.
in one prison's housing area,

288
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,440
despite the fact
the estimated cost of installation

289
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,640
was only around 4 million.

290
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,880
And they've also thrown around
some suspiciously high estimates.

291
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,920
They once claimed
that it would cost 109 million dollars

292
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,360
to install A.C. in a unit for
developmentally disabled prisoners,

293
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,280
even though the entire housing unit
cost just 26 million to build.

294
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,680
I admit: I don't know much
about A.C. installation.

295
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,720
If you pointed at a random building
and said:

296
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,360
"It cost 10 000 dollars
to install A.C. in there",

297
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,920
I'd say: "Okay, sure."

298
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,280
If you pointed at another and said:
"It cost 3 million to install it",

299
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,320
I would say:
"Yeah. Makes sense."

300
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,160
But if you pointed at a building
and said:

301
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,200
"It cost four times the price of that
building to install A.C. in it",

302
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,800
I'd say: "I think you somehow know
less about air conditioning than I do."

303
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,000
And that "too expensive" argument
gets even harder to take

304
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,960
when you consider that,
in some prisons,

305
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,440
there is climate control,
just not for the prisoners.

306
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,920
Some have A.C. in staff offices.
And then there is this...

307
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,160
Two years ago, prison officials
spent more than 700 000 dollars

308
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,600
on new climate-controlled
housing facilities.

309
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,840
For prisoners ? No.
For the prisons' in-house pig farms.

310
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,680
Officials say the cooling systems
are, quote:

311
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,920
"consistent
with any swine operation."

312
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,160
I'm not against
pigs getting treated comfortably.

313
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,400
I love pigs, their springy tails,
their too-big ears,

314
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,160
their stupid flat noses
and their horrible eyes.

315
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,160
Pigs are like big chubby dogs
you can eat at Christmas.

316
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,920
I just question prioritizing
their comfort over humans.

317
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,840
And the thing is, corrections systems
do seem to acknowledge

318
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,720
that they do have a problem
with heat,

319
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,280
it's just, they often try to treat it
with ridiculous half-measures.

320
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,200
The Texas prison system produced
this video on what staff should do

321
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,560
when they see someone about
to pass out from heat exhaustion.

322
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,080
If conscious and alert,

323
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,400
have the person drink water
or a rehydrating sports drink.

324
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,400
Do not give them
caffeinated drinks,

325
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,720
as these will contribute
to further dehydration.

326
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,400
Sprinkle or spray them with water
and apply cool water

327
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,680
or wet cloths to the person's
neck, armpits, and groin.

328
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,320
Fan the person if there is no breeze.

329
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,760
Flicking water in their face and
fanning them with a clipboard

330
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,080
is just not going to cut it.

331
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,440
At that point, it makes basically
just as much sense to recommend:

332
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,760
"lick the person's sweat
off their forehead,"

333
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,480
or "rub them with a DVD
of 'Captain Philips'."

334
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,640
Sure, it's technically a gesture,
but it's not going to do much.

335
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,480
When prisons use things like
large fans and water misters,

336
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,560
they only help to a certain
threshold of heat.

337
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,560
Beyond it, they can actually
make things worse.

338
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,080
Water misters increase humidity
and the CDC has explicitly said

339
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,320
that it "does not recommend the use
of fans above a 95 degree heat index,"

340
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,760
as they "actually increase
heat stress by blowing air"

341
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,480
"that is warmer
than the body's temperature."

342
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,320
Dangerous situations
get compounded by the fact

343
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,440
that when heat-related issues occur,

344
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,800
prisons can show very little urgency
in addressing them.

345
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,000
Take what happened
to Larry McCollum.

346
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,000
He was serving an 11-month
sentence for cashing a bad check

347
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,240
and began showing symptoms
of heat stroke,

348
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,200
but prison employees
didn't call EMS

349
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,760
until over 40 minutes after
he was found convulsing.

350
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,200
When McCollum
finally arrived at the hospital,

351
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,480
his body temperature was 109 degrees
and he died days later.

352
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,160
When that prison's warden

353
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,600
was questioned about the delay
in medical treatment,

354
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,920
this was his ridiculous response...

355
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,440
If you were at home and your wife
was having a heart attack

356
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,120
and you called 9-1-1 and it took
a half hour for them to arrive,

357
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,760
would you have a problem
with that ?

358
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,880
That's speculating. I wouldn't know
if she had a heart attack or not.

359
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,920
I would have a problem with that,
just letting you know. Okay ?

360
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,520
If my wife was having a heart attack
and I called 9-1-1

361
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,520
and it took a half hour
for an ambulance to arrive.

362
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,120
You don't feel comfortable

363
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,080
saying that you too would have
an issue with that ?

364
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,960
I would not. I would have to figure out
whether it's a heart attack or not.

365
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,760
Maybe just bad chili.

366
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,880
What the fuck ?
First, no one would ever confuse

367
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,520
someone having violent convulsions
with having bad chili.

368
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Second, "bad chili" has a name,
and it's called Hormel.

369
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,320
Show some respect
to that can of bean nightmares.

370
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,000
Guessing your wife's heart attack
might be just bad chili

371
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,040
is a terrible answer, not only because
that's not how heart attacks work,

372
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,600
it's also
not how hypotheticals work.

373
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,200
In this scenario, your wife
is having a heart attack.

374
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,280
You can't just ignore the premise.
If someone asks:

375
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,920
"If you could have dinner with anyone,
living or dead, who would you choose ?"

376
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,840
You're not allowed to say:
"No thanks, I already ate."

377
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:32,520
That's not the point of the question.
As bad as that response was,

378
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,520
it wasn't even the worst moment
in his deposition.

379
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,520
Months later, he was asked about
how the population of his prison

380
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,280
might be more susceptible
to heat-related illness.

381
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,200
Watch this infuriating exchange.

382
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,960
Do you suspect some in your facility
are going to have hypertension ?

383
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,360
I do not know.

384
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,240
Do you suspect some in your facility
are going to be older than 60 ?

385
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,720
I do not know.

386
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,840
Do you suspect that some
are going to be older than 40 ?

387
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,200
I do not know.

388
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,760
Do you suspect that some
that are gonna come into your facility

389
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,600
are going to be
on psychotropic medications ?

390
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,120
I do not know.

391
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,960
Wouldn't any competent supervisor...

392
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,840
Shouldn't he or she know
the answers to those questions ?

393
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
I do not know.

394
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,800
Okay, we get it.
You don't know a lot of things.

395
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,280
I almost wish that line
of questioning had continued.

396
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,840
Do you suspect that some
are fire mutants powered by heat ?

397
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,080
I do not know.

398
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,280
Do you have a tattoo of Peppa Pig
on your lower back ?

399
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
I do not know.

400
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,520
If no one would ever find out,
would you have sex with a dolphin ?

401
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,640
I do not know.

402
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,120
Would you hit Bruce Willis with
your car if given the opportunity ?

403
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,280
I do not know.

404
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,120
Why responding
with "I do not know"

405
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,080
to every question asked of a person
makes them sound like a total dipshit ?

406
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,560
I do not know.

407
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,280
So look,
when you put all of this together,

408
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,680
prisoners in this country
are desperately uncomfortable

409
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,760
and sometimes
dying due to the heat

410
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,240
and no one seems to give enough
of a shit to do anything about it.

411
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,440
While a lot of the facilities
that I've shown you tonight

412
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,840
have been in Texas, that is not
because it's the only culprit.

413
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,080
It's just one of the only states

414
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,240
where this story has been
extensively reported on camera.

415
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,320
But you can find accounts of similar
problems in places like Louisiana

416
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,600
and in Alabama, and in Florida,
and in Michigan, and in Virginia.

417
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,400
This is a deadly situation
and it's only going to get worse,

418
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,560
especially as summers
are getting hotter and hotter.

419
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,040
While this is just one small part
of a much larger discussion

420
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,600
about whether and how prisons
should exist in this country,

421
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,800
until such time as we have
that discussion,

422
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,080
there's an easy solution
to this one problem, and that is:

423
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,120
prisons need air conditioning,
so put air conditioning in. That's it.

424
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,000
I know this show has trained you
to anticipate nuance,

425
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,000
but this one
is really pretty straightforward.

426
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,600
We shouldn't be cooking prisoners
to death. The end.

427
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,640
That's just not something we should be
allowing, under any circumstances.

428
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,720
Because locking human beings in rooms
with a heat index of 150 degrees

429
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,640
begs the question:
"How on earth could anyone,"

430
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,440
"anywhere think that it's okay
to do that ?"

431
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,840
And to borrow the go-to answer
of an extremely weird, cruel man:

432
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,360
"I do not know."
And now, this.

433
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,840
Ernie Anastos Left Fox 5 One Year Ago
This Week,

434
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,560
And We Miss His Man On The Street
Segments More Than Ever.

435
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,880
So here's my question: what's
your favorite way to watch TV ?

436
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,200
- In my bed.
- In your bed ? It's relaxing ?

437
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,480
- Probably in a recliner.
- In a recliner ?

438
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,000
- Yeah, you have one ?
- Yeah.

439
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,640
Where's the worst place
you've ever been stuck ?

440
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,960
X-ray machine. Yeah.

441
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,600
What consistency do you like
your milkshake to be ?

442
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,000
Thick.

443
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,480
Do you have a lot
of baby pictures of yourself ?

444
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,920
How do you handle
people who annoy you ?

445
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,800
What do you like to do
on Labor Day ?

446
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,720
Can you spell "Caribbean" ?
Do you know who your neighbors are ?

447
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,520
- I'm friendly with my neighbors !
- Good for you, tell me about that !

448
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,120
Is there a nickname
that you wish you had ?

449
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,640
Swifty.

450
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,840
If you're watching a show about
food, does it make you hungry ?

451
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,120
Yes !

452
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,560
What do you think tastes good,

453
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,520
delicious, but it's really
difficult or messy to eat ?

454
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Pasta.

455
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,040
I'm sloppy with spaghetti
and meatballs.

456
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,320
- That's a popular one, isn't it ?
- It can get sloppy all over my shirt.

457
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,400
The tomato sauce and everything ?
But it tastes good, doesn't it ?

458
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,920
- Best.
- That's great.

459
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,000
The other thing
I would say is the soup.

460
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,560
That can be sloppy.

461
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,920
Before we go, I wanted to take
a moment to discuss commercials.

462
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,960
The thing you subscribe to HBO
to avoid seeing.

463
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,680
Specifically, I'd like to talk about
ads for local car dealerships.

464
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,960
Because they can be absolute
works of art, like this one.

465
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,520
Hey y'all,
it's Bryce "Thug Nasty" Mitchell here.

466
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,360
I'm at Drive On Time Motors,
900 East Line Road,

467
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,160
Searcy, Arkansas, White County.
They paid me to be here.

468
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,240
These ain't my cars
and I don't really care about 'em.

469
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,120
When I ripped
my testicles open with a drill,

470
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,400
I had to drive myself
to the hospital in my pickup truck.

471
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,880
I wish I would've had this Corvette.
I would've made it on time.

472
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,520
That commercial raises
a thousand questions

473
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,560
and answers
exactly none of them.

474
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,440
How did Thug Nasty rip
his testicles open with a drill ?

475
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,200
Why did he have a drill
near his testicles in the first place ?

476
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,960
Most importantly,
what does he mean,

477
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,440
he "didn't make it
to the hospital on time ?"

478
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,320
You know what ? I don't want
or need any more context.

479
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,760
The beauty is in the mystery
of Bryce's self-drilled scrotum.

480
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:48,040
There is a real charm in
the eccentricity of car dealership ads.

481
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,880
Because they can be
a total law unto themselves.

482
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,560
But recently,
we discovered something surprising.

483
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,520
And it all started
with this commercial.

484
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,920
I'm in a pickle.

485
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,880
My doctor told me to calm down
before my heart explodes.

486
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,440
The only way for me to calm down
is to help you get a nicer, newer car.

487
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,280
Okay. I don't mind that !
A guy dressed as a pickle,

488
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,680
next to an Uncle Sam
who looks like Mark Cuban,

489
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,600
seeming to threaten that if you don't
buy a car from him, he's going to die.

490
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,200
I actually like that !
That's some fun local weirdness

491
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,280
from Winston-Salem, North Carolina,
you're not gonna get anywhere else.

492
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,760
Well, it turns out, wrong.
Because watch this...

493
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,120
You know me, Scott Elder here
from Elder Mitsubishi.

494
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,720
I'm in a pickle.
My doctor told me

495
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,080
to turn it down a notch
before my heart explodes.

496
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,360
Scott Lehman here from Premier
Auto Center, and I'm in a pickle !

497
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,000
My doctor told me to calm down
before my heart explodes !

498
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,880
Fred Grote here
from Grote Automotive.

499
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,160
Doctor told me I need to turn it down
a notch so my heart doesn't explode.

500
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,240
Steve Johnson here
from Zumbrota Ford.

501
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,080
My doctor told me to turn it down
a notch so my heart doesn't explode.

502
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,800
Help I'm in a pickle !

503
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,640
Dad, your doctor told you to calm
down before your heart explodes.

504
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,880
That's striking.

505
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,120
When you see that many screaming
white guys in pickle costumes,

506
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,320
they're yelling "Rick and Morty"
quotes at any woman in their vicinity

507
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,280
and completely ruining Comic Con.

508
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,040
And if you're wondering
what is going on there:

509
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,960
as best we can tell,
all those dealerships have worked

510
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,640
with a marketing firm called
Gravitational Marketing,

511
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,400
based, obviously, in Florida,

512
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,400
which seems to churn out scripts
for a bunch of local car dealers.

513
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,720
Explaining why you can find
so many ads in different places

514
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,880
that are basically exactly the same.

515
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,840
We found multiple Hulk Hogans in
eerily similar wrestling-themed ads

516
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,880
and multiple bunnies
in identical Easter commercials

517
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,640
and then we found
whatever the fuck this is.

518
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,560
It's John here from Blue Ridge
and I'm in the doghouse. I need cars !

519
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,080
It's Mike Guizar, and I'm in
the doghouse. I need cars !

520
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,880
It's Jack Frost, and I'm in
the doghouse. I need cars !

521
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,680
We're in the doghouse
and we need cars !

522
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,080
What is that ? I mean,
what is the concept there ?

523
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,640
Do these car dealers think scripts
that bad are worth outsourcing ?

524
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,400
"We're in the doghouse
and we need cars ?"

525
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,080
Don Draper would put his cigarette
out on your forehead

526
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,880
if you pitched a line like that.

527
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,680
But I will say, once you start
going down this rabbit hole,

528
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,880
it is kind of fascinating to see
the different performance choices

529
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,960
that dealers make
with the same ad.

530
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,000
Take this one, themed for autumn.

531
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,040
Guten tag, Coastal Bend.
I'm running out of year.

532
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,200
I've gotta liven up my sales
so I'm giving you thousands off

533
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:28,240
a nicer, newer car with my lifetime
warranty during my Cartoberfest.

534
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,720
Past credit mishaps
making you feel like a wiener ?

535
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,080
My "for the people, everybody drives"
credit approval process helps you.

536
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,040
You get the concept. Cartoberfest.

537
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,480
And Tommy Gardner is giving you
a decent line reading there.

538
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,200
Sort of a Meryl Streep in
"The Devil Wears Prada" energy,

539
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,920
a "less is more" kind of thing.

540
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,160
Tommy knows that the costumes, music
and cinematography are working well,

541
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,560
so he's centering the ad with an
understated yet confident performance.

542
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,280
But witness that same concept
cranked up around 25 notches.

543
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,800
Guten tag, east Tennessee,
my sales are slumping,

544
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,480
so let's get bumping
in my Car-toberfest.

545
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,160
Fall is here, I'm running out of year.
I'm so stressed, come be my guest.

546
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
Don't be a wiener, drive cleaner

547
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:17,320
and save up to 5 500 dollars
on a nicer, newer car. Guten tag !

548
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,720
There is a lot
I could say about that.

549
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,640
I could say, in the words of that
man's obvious idol, Jim Carrey:

550
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,040
"Somebody stop him."

551
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,960
Or I could point out
that the accent he's doing there

552
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,440
would be problematic if it were still
possible to be racist towards Germans.

553
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,480
That man is Jason Farris
of Farris Motor Company.

554
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,440
When you look at what he has done
with these pro forma scripts,

555
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,680
you see that he routinely
makes some capital-C choices,

556
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,360
but perhaps none as bold

557
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,680
as when he got a stock
Independence Day script and did this.

558
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:48,760
I'm pledging allegiance to the red,
white, and you in a nicer, newer car.

559
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,320
Be a patriot today and declare
independence from your old ride

560
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,840
for just 7 dollars down.

561
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,680
But hurry, like ISIS,
this deal won't be around long.

562
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,200
No, Jason !
That is a no from me !

563
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,160
We watched a number of
those Independence Day commercials

564
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,080
and guess which line wasn't in any
of the other scripts ?

565
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,360
Yep !
It's the one you're thinking of.

566
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,480
But the problem here is that,

567
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,120
even when they are not
casually Islamophobic,

568
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,720
it ruins the magic
of these bizarre local ads

569
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,920
to learn that many are just
scripts that someone bought.

570
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,680
The joy of local car commercials
is when they pop up

571
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,520
in the middle of "Wheel of Fortune"
and you think:

572
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,200
"This is completely deranged,
but at least our local car dealer"

573
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,480
"is trying to be creative, at least we
as a local market are special, right ?"

574
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,960
But that might not be the case.
We need to make sure that it is.

575
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,640
We need a return to the one-of-a-kind
autodealer ad that no one else has.

576
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,520
Remember how thrilling it was to see
Bryce "Thug Nasty" Mitchell

577
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,560
talk about his shattered scrotum ?

578
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,320
I do ! I love that ad, but I definitely
don't want to see 15 copies of it.

579
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,640
I want Bryce to be a unicorn.

580
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,360
Local ads should be unique
and completely unhinged.

581
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,840
And here is where
we might be able to help.

582
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,520
Because we've written a script.
And it's good. It's really good.

583
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,840
And we're offering it to one,
and only one car dealership,

584
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:15,160
to use in a commercial, for free,
so long as they agree to simple terms.

585
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,480
The main one being,

586
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,760
you have to agree to produce this
exactly as it is written.

587
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,640
And you can't read it
before you agree.

588
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,400
We promise there is no cursing,
blasphemy, or nudity in here.

589
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,040
It will pass broadcast standards
in your area.

590
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,000
It can be produced as cheaply
as anything you've seen tonight.

591
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,600
Will this script show
your dealership in a good light ?

592
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,080
That's for you to find out
after you sign this contract

593
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,520
and agree to produce and air the ad,
sight unseen.

594
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,200
So, who's interested ?

595
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,960
What do you say,
Scott Elder of Cedar Park ?

596
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,000
Fred Grote of Fort Wayne ?
Scott Lehman of Arizona ?

597
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,400
If you guys or, indeed,
any local car dealership out there,

598
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,920
want to take us up
on this one-time offer,

599
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,480
you can reach us at free-car-commercial

600
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,440
at-John-Oliver-wants-your-rat-erotica
dot-com.

601
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,640
Come on, dealers ! You know
you want to roll the dice here !

602
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,840
Let us get you into a nicer,
newer commercial today.

603
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,640
That's our show ! Thanks for watching,
we'll see you next week, goodnight !

604
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,840
Guten tag !
