LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,660
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight".
I'm John Oliver.

3
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,300
Thank you for joining us, just time
for a quick recap of the week,

4
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,940
and as this is our final show of 2021,
we thought we'd check in on the event

5
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,140
that started all of it,
the January 6th insurrection.

6
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,900
That's right!
This year started with that

7
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,540
and against all better judgment,
kept going.

8
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,980
While the human cause of the riots
is still stonewalling investigators,

9
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,460
this week saw developments regarding
some of its rank-and-file participants.

10
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,940
A Capitol riot suspect
on the FBI's Most Wanted list

11
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,700
has turned up now in Belarus.

12
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,300
The fugitive's name is Evan Neumann.
He's from California.

13
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,980
Here he is during an interview
with state media in Belarus.

14
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,940
Neumann claims he's innocent
and a victim of political persecution.

15
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,260
Great idea, Evan! You're worried
about political persecution,

16
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,340
so you go to Belarus,

17
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,180
country run by a man who calls himself
"the last and only dictator in Europe."

18
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,980
You can read all about their
free-flowing exchange of ideas

19
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,020
in any of Belarus's publications,
like Redacted Magazine

20
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,620
and All Praise Our Glorious Leader
Who Isn't Bald Quarterly!

21
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,260
Other participants in the insurrection
have been facing consequences.

22
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,260
The QAnon Shaman, a name I still
cannot believe I have to say out loud,

23
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,820
is awaiting sentencing
after pleading guilty.

24
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,060
Then there is Jenna Ryan,
a Texas real estate agent

25
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,740
who entered the Capitol, and later
got attention for Tweeting:

26
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,540
"Definitely not going to jail.
Sorry I have blonde hair, white skin,"

27
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,780
"a great job, a great future
and I'm not going to jail."

28
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,060
Which is, on one hand,
a dangerously brazen Tweet,

29
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,620
but on the other, a pretty great
"Real Housewives" catchphrase.

30
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,860
"I have blonde hair, white skin
and I'm not going to jail."

31
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,660
She's the new Erika Jayne
and I don't say that lightly.

32
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,580
But to be fair, Jenna Ryan was right.
She's not going to jail.

33
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,220
Because she's actually going to prison.
Earlier this month,

34
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,420
she was sentenced
to 60 days behind bars

35
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,980
and this week,
sat down with local news

36
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,540
to make it absolutely clear
she's learned nothing from this.

37
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,380
Ryan flew with friends
on a private plane

38
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,140
to the Stop the Steal rally
in D.C. before going back to her hotel.

39
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,500
While watching news coverage,
she decided to go back

40
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,660
and posted a video saying
she was going to storm the Capitol.

41
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,340
I was like:
"We're storming the Capitol!"

42
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,380
and I meant, we're storming
with our words,

43
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,780
we're going down there to tell them,
you know, it's free speech.

44
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,340
We are armed and dangerous!
This is the beginning!

45
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,740
What are you talking about,
you Marjorie Taylor Wanna-Greene?

46
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,260
"Storming with words?"
That's not a thing.

47
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,580
That's never been a thing. If you
look up "thing" in the dictionary,

48
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,620
I'm pretty sure it says:
"Not storming with words."

49
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,060
Jenna also outlined how she's preparing
for her 60-day sentence,

50
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,700
which is, if nothing else,
on brand.

51
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,100
It's all you can think about.
I'm watching all the YouTube videos

52
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,020
on how prison is,
how to go to prison, what to do.

53
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,740
I don't know what's weirder there,
that she seems so casual

54
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,660
or that an adult has to go to YouTube
to learn how prison is.

55
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,940
I'll tell you, it's bad, Jenna!
Really bad!

56
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,820
Also, that is not what YouTube
should be used for.

57
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,220
YouTube is for watching
two-minute movie trailers,

58
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,820
40-minute explainer videos

59
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,140
pointing out all the easter eggs
you missed in that trailer

60
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,220
and TikTok compilations
because you're too old to learn TikTok

61
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,060
but too desperate to let it
pass you by completely.

62
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,820
That is what YouTube is for.
And of course, destroying the world

63
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,140
by melting people's brains
with utter nonsense.

64
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,660
Speaking of which, in the least
surprising move imaginable,

65
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,380
Jenna Ryan launched a podcast
on her YouTube channel this week.

66
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,860
Here is a clip
from Monday's first episode.

67
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,780
I want you to be able
to come to my channel,

68
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,460
listen to what I have to say and be
well caught-up on alternative news.

69
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,620
I just made that up!
That's what I want.

70
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,180
We're in hell.

71
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:21,380
Ryan is not alone in not learning
important lessons from January 6th.

72
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,340
Take Representative Paul Gosar,
who bragged that he helped organize

73
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,500
the very first
Stop the Steal rally in Arizona

74
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,580
and "Tweeted various versions
of Stop the Steal at least 25 times"

75
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,260
in the run-up to the insurrection.

76
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,460
Gosar is still very much in Congress
and just this week,

77
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,460
was criticized for pulling this shit.

78
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,860
A U.S. congressman is under fire
today for posting a video

79
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,180
which simulates him killing
one of his colleagues.

80
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,420
Republican Paul Gosar from Arizona
shared the clip on social media,

81
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,220
which was altered
from a popular anime series.

82
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,140
In it, a cartoon figure with his face
attacks a figure with the face

83
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,460
of Democratic congresswoman
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

84
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,060
It also appears to go after
President Biden with swords.

85
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,140
Clearly, there is a lot going on there.
But just in terms of sheer weirdness,

86
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,420
I'm not sure that I can get
over the idea that Paul Gosar,

87
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,740
this guy, is in any way
familiar with anime.

88
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,220
When I see Paul Gosar,
I think a few things.

89
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,540
I think asshole, troll,
plucked Sam the Eagle,

90
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,260
guy who looks like he Googles "why
aren't there more breakfast soups".

91
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
But anime fan? This guy?

92
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,300
Shame on me, I guess,
for judging a book by its cover.

93
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,180
Please carry on and enjoy
"Neon Genesis Evangelion",

94
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,820
subs not dubs, 'til the day
they put you in the ground.

95
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,740
Instead of simply apologizing,
Gosar doubled down,

96
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,860
Tweeting this meme in response,
saying: "It's a cartoon, relax."

97
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:46,300
And look, it is, kind of.
It'd be disingenuous of me

98
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,700
to pretend that Gosar Tweeting
a poorly-edited anime video

99
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,100
meant that he was going
to physically attack AOC.

100
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,780
I don't think
he's going to do that,

101
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,260
not least because if he did,
he would lose.

102
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,140
But also, just because
something isn't a literal threat

103
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,340
doesn't mean it can't still
inspire real-world harm.

104
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,140
Because if we've learned
anything from January 6th,

105
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,740
and it seems that
we have not learned nearly enough,

106
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,420
it's that it's very easy for a joke
to become reality,

107
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,780
and that a troubling number of people
don't seem to understand the difference

108
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,780
between "storming the Capitol"
metaphorically and physically.

109
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,420
Knowing full well that this video
might now show up

110
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,700
if Jenna searches YouTube for "what
to do in prison after Capitol riots",

111
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,820
allow me to take this opportunity
to address her directly.

112
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,220
Jenna, from the bottom of my heart,
thanks for watching,

113
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,420
smash that like button, hit subscribe,
sound off in the comments

114
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,860
with what you want big swingin'
John to talk about in a future video,

115
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,460
the fun continues in my Instagram,
so check that out

116
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,740
and, as always, new merch
in the description.

117
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,220
Namaste. And now, this.

118
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:53,140
And Now: The Many Questions
of Fox and Friends' Brian Kilmeade.

119
00:06:53,860 --> 00:07:00,140
How do diners have 20 pages in their
menu? They can make anything, right?

120
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,620
Why do all newborns
have that same blanket?

121
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,220
What great American decided that
you needed a bun with a hot dog?

122
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,700
What's the difference between
SoulCycle and spinning? Do we know?

123
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,660
And why did it hit the iceberg?
Do we know?

124
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,740
What do bears eat? Squirrels?
Why are bears always alone?

125
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,380
Do you think the sharks know
it's Shark Week?

126
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,020
What part of the cow is the skirt?
It makes you question everything.

127
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,860
Why was it ever
the International House of Pancakes?

128
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,300
But how does a baby retire?
What if a tree could just hover?

129
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,820
Is Spam meat? What's this called?
Why are turnips so seasonal?

130
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,900
Do you have turnips
more than once a year?

131
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,860
Why don't we have turnips all year
round? Because the pilgrims didn't?

132
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,820
- You do?
- Yeah, sure.

133
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,620
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns unions.

134
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,700
The institutions that brought us
the weekend, the middle class

135
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,460
and, in the case of the international
ladies garment workers union,

136
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,340
an absolute banger of a song.

137
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,060
And before we play this,
I have a favorite singer here,

138
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,660
see if they're yours too.

139
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,260
Look for the union label

140
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,780
When you are buying
that coat, dress, or blouse.

141
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,460
Remember somewhere
our union's sewing,

142
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:11,220
Our wages going to feed the kids...
And run the house.

143
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,700
We work hard,
but who's complaining?

144
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,220
Thanks to the ILG,
we're paying our way!

145
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,780
So, always look for the union label,

146
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,860
It says we're able
to make it in the USA!

147
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,460
They look so happy!
It's a video so uplifting,

148
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,660
you barely pause to wonder
how many of them are dead now.

149
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,980
By the way, yes, my favorite singer
is the "and run the house" lady.

150
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,020
She's the only one who gets
to make a dramatic entrance.

151
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,420
She's got a fabulous mushroom haircut,
wide lapels and the voice of an angel.

152
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,180
Every singer in that song is a star,
but she is the brightest in the galaxy.

153
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,660
Now, that ad, if it weren't obvious
from every single thing about it,

154
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,860
is from the early 1980s,
and unfortunately, since then,

155
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,420
union membership
has declined considerably.

156
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,140
Today, just over 10 percent of American
workers belong to a union.

157
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,180
That is just half the rate it was
in 1983,

158
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,060
meaning we're currently living in one
of the worst times for organized labor

159
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,740
in our country's history.

160
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,020
And it's not like
the demand isn't there.

161
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,340
Nearly half of non-union workers
say they would like to be in a union.

162
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,580
A lot of workplaces do seem
like a natural fit for one.

163
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,420
Take Amazon. You've likely
heard the infamous stories

164
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,420
of drivers being forced to pee
in bottles in order to make quotas,

165
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,140
stories that Amazon initially denied,
then apologized for denying,

166
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,380
finally admitting that their drivers
do sometimes have to piss in bottles.

167
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,700
It's like the old adage: "'Tis better
to seek forgiveness than permission,"

168
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,020
"unless this is about piss bottles,
in which case,"

169
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,740
"take a look at yourself, man,
what are you even doing?"

170
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,180
Mahatma Gandhi.

171
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,260
Yet, despite that and other reports
of abysmal working conditions,

172
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,140
an organizing drive for Amazon
warehouse workers in Bessemer,

173
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,660
was voted down
by more than two to one.

174
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,100
Which may seem like a clear-cut case

175
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,060
of workers deciding
for themselves to reject a union,

176
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,100
but the truth is
it's a lot more complicated than that.

177
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,340
Because if you have never been through
a union organizing drive yourself,

178
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,780
you might assume that a union vote
is a completely free and fair election,

179
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,860
that is an illusion fed by executives
like Jeff Bezos,

180
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,260
America's least-inspiring astronaut,
through statements like this.

181
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,220
We don't believe
that we need a union

182
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,300
to be an intermediary
between us and our employees

183
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,660
but, of course, at the end of the day,
it's always the employees' choice.

184
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,940
And that's how it should be.

185
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,420
Yeah, I don't know about you,
but I'm personally not comforted

186
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,660
by hearing one of the richest men
on earth say, "It's your choice."

187
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,460
No matter the context,
all I can hear is:

188
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:52,060
"Spear or arrow? How would you prefer
to be hunted? It's your choice."

189
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,100
But it is worth knowing
just how many ways

190
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,660
Amazon and many other companies
try to influence the employees' choice.

191
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,500
Because they can exert
a huge amount of pressure.

192
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,500
So, tonight,
let's take a look at union busting,

193
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,540
what it is, how it works

194
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,540
and how few consequences
companies face for doing it.

195
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,740
Let's start with a basic breakdown
of how a union drive works.

196
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,060
The first thing to know is that
any employer may recognize a union

197
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,060
based solely on majority support.

198
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,860
So, they can let employees
unionize immediately,

199
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,340
but they are not required to do that,

200
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,180
unless it's been chosen
through a secret ballot vote.

201
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,380
Unsurprisingly, that is how most
unions end up getting recognized.

202
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,860
The first key step in union busting

203
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,860
is preventing things
from ever reaching that point.

204
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,660
Because for an election
to happen at all,

205
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,580
30 percent of workers
must sign a union card,

206
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,740
expressing an initial interest
in union representation.

207
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,420
But Amazon, for instance,
has instructed its managers

208
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,420
to be on high alert for the slightest
sign that that might happen,

209
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,540
as this leaked internal video shows.

210
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,300
If you see warning signs
of potential organizing,

211
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,100
notify your building HRM
and GM site leader immediately.

212
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,260
The most obvious signs would include
use of words associated with unions

213
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,740
or union-led movements
like "living wage" or "steward".

214
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:17,060
Set aside how mask-off it is
to treat the phrase "living wage"

215
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,380
like the first warning sign
of a stroke,

216
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,940
you would also think a 2 trillion
dollars company like Amazon

217
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,660
could spring for better
animation than JibJab.

218
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,780
If enough workers do sign cards,
the election process is then underway.

219
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,220
And in that process, companies
have some pretty huge advantages.

220
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,900
Because obviously,
when you're on their premises,

221
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,820
they have unfettered access to you,

222
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,860
while also having the ability
to keep union reps out.

223
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,180
Many companies take full advantage
of that access.

224
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,660
Amazon, for instance,
inundated workers

225
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,340
with anti-union signs
all over their workplace,

226
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,460
even putting them
inside bathroom stalls.

227
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,300
They also used workers' contact info

228
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,820
to send multiple anti-union
text messages to them per day

229
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,540
and held mandatory meetings
that seemed designed to spread fear.

230
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,540
They had somebody who was like
the captain of the union busting

231
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,580
who would come down
and teach, like...

232
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,980
What was
the official title of the class?

233
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,580
They just called it union training.
That's it.

234
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,900
Which is funny because it's not union
training. It's union busting 101.

235
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,300
It's not union training if
the explicit goal is to kill the union.

236
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,700
It would be like taking a dog
training class from Cruella de Vil.

237
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,420
Although, no, not the one that's
a misunderstood bohemian or whatever,

238
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,580
I'm talking about the real Cruella.

239
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,460
Yeah, that one.
The original dogicidal bad bitch.

240
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,980
These mandatory propaganda sessions
are called "captive audience meetings"

241
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,500
and most Amazon workers at Bessemer
were having to attend two per week.

242
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,820
And that is not uncommon,
nearly 90 percent of employers

243
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,980
facing union campaigns
hold captive audience meetings.

244
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,580
Starbucks is facing a union drive
at six of its stores in Buffalo

245
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,060
and it has been doing everything
that you've seen so far,

246
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,860
sending anti-union text messages,
putting up signs

247
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,020
and holding
"captive audience meetings."

248
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,900
It may be no coincidence that Amazon's
and Starbucks' tactics are similar.

249
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,300
Because both hired union
busting law firms and consultants

250
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,380
to help them with their campaigns,
which is not unusual,

251
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,900
union busting is a whole industry.

252
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,540
There are now
about 2000 of these firms,

253
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,740
some of which have euphemistic names
like the Labor Relations Institute

254
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,020
and 75 percent of companies
facing organizing drives hire one,

255
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,460
spending nearly 340 million dollars
on them per year.

256
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,420
These firms offer
different levels of services.

257
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,620
For companies on a budget, some
offer massproduced anti-union videos.

258
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:47,180
You can even buy this one, featuring
a cartoonishly union organizer,

259
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,780
shot against a greenscreen,

260
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,300
so that you can customize it
based on your workplace.

261
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,260
They even produced samples
of what that could look like...

262
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,540
Listen, just sign the card.
Once a union gets here,

263
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,380
you wanna be
on the good side.

264
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,940
Just sign the card. Once a union gets
here, you wanna be on the good side.

265
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,260
Sign the card. Once a union gets
here, you wanna be on the good side.

266
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,500
I'll say this, at least they chose
outfits that'd fit in any workplace,

267
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,300
because we all know employees in
both corporate offices and warehouses

268
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,020
dress like a college football coach
whose wife just left him

269
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,740
and an "America's Next Top Model"
contestant before the makeover.

270
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,100
Although the backdrops clearly
could have been more creative there.

271
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,380
You've got a green screen,
the world is your oyster.

272
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,500
Why not show evil unionizers
mobilizing on a roller coaster

273
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,060
or on a tropical getaway,
or on the desert planet of Arrakis?

274
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,620
If you're going to force employees
to watch your bullshit,

275
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,900
at least take them on a cosmic journey
with sandy softboy space Jesus.

276
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,500
Whether it is coming directly from
a company or through an outside firm,

277
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,740
anti-union campaigns tend to follow
a pretty basic playbook.

278
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:00,420
And a go-to tactic is to highlight
that unions collect dues.

279
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,460
A point Delta Airlines made when
employees were considering unionizing

280
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,940
and they did it
in a pretty dickish way.

281
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,660
Delta Airlines causing a lot
of turbulence on the ground

282
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,020
after it told employees to buy
video games instead of unionizing.

283
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,860
One poster, here it is, says: "Union
dues cost around 700 dolalrs a year"

284
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,380
and then tells employees
to put their money

285
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,900
towards a video game system
with the latest hits.

286
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,900
The latest hits, you say!

287
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,060
Telling your workers to play
video games instead of unionizing

288
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,900
is incredibly condescending.

289
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,500
And doubly so when you consider
video game characters

290
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,180
are the ultimate example
of exploited labor.

291
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,980
They take orders all day,
usually get paid in coins

292
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,940
and not once in 36 years
of playing Mario

293
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,260
have I ever seen him get to take
a bathroom break. Not once!

294
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,660
The Mushroom Kingdom has to be
littered with piss bottles.

295
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,420
And you might say:
"Of course a union collects dues."

296
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,780
"How else are they going to have
resources to fight for their members?"

297
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,740
But these consulting firms will insist
that unions simply take money

298
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,420
and offer nothing in return.

299
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,700
Here is how
the Labor Relations Institute puts it

300
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,620
in one of its union busting videos.

301
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,340
Unions are in trouble.
Their membership is shrinking,

302
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,500
which means they're in danger
of going out of business.

303
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:20,100
They send out high-pressure
salespeople to sell a bill of goods

304
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,380
that most people believe is either of
no real value or is highly overpriced.

305
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,580
Okay, so, just to be clear,
that is a for-profit consulting firm,

306
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,940
being paid by a for-profit company,

307
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,020
arguing that unions
are only in it for the money.

308
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,460
That is pretty fantastic. It's not even
the pot calling the kettle black,

309
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,620
it's the pot calling the kettle
a pot.

310
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,300
It's like being called a bad first date
by Ted Bundy.

311
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,580
Now, LRI consultants
have also told employees

312
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,300
that joining a union might get
them a contract with less wages

313
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,700
and less benefits
than they currently have.

314
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,900
Think about
how ridiculous that argument is.

315
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,860
If companies genuinely thought

316
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,220
unions would negotiate
worse terms for their employees,

317
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,420
they'd be welcoming them in
with open arms.

318
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,020
Jeff Bezos would've shown up to that
interview in a Che Guevara T-shirt

319
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,140
if he thought it would help him
pay people less.

320
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,900
Because the truth here is,
unionized workers in the private sector

321
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,580
have wages about 25 percent higher
than their non-union counterparts.

322
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,660
That is why companies
want to keep unions out.

323
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:28,340
That is why they're willing to pay
LRI "3000 per consultant per day."

324
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,140
But the anti-union argument
isn't just that they are useless,

325
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,980
it's that they'll destroy the workplace
culture that companies have created.

326
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,180
Here is how Target framed it in one
of their union busting videos.

327
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,700
If the unions did try to organize
Target team members,

328
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,380
they could also try and bring along
their way of doing business,

329
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,460
an old-fashioned rigid structure.

330
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,740
No one knows exactly
what could happen,

331
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:56,020
but there are lots of examples of how
rigid grocery store union contracts

332
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,220
could hurt our store's ability
to serve guests.

333
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,700
Here's what we mean.

334
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,580
Let's say
you're working in stationery,

335
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,940
but you're walking through domestics
on your way to check on something.

336
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,620
A guest stops you and asks for help.
What would you do?

337
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,860
Without even thinking about it,

338
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,380
you'd stop and give them
any assistance they required.

339
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,300
What if union work rules say you
can't work outside of your department?

340
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,020
What do you tell the guest?
"Sorry, I can't help you."?

341
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,860
That makes you look bad.
But more importantly,

342
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,300
it means our guest
doesn't get immediate attention

343
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,980
and they might not come back.

344
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,140
So, everyone gets hurt.
Everyone except the union.

345
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:41,260
I like how they put that last part in
black and white, so we know it's bad.

346
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,860
We're talking "can't open a jar" bad.
There's got to be a better way!

347
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,860
But if I can just give the Target
executives one quick note:

348
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,940
have you ever worked retail?

349
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,300
Because if you had,
you would know

350
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,460
that telling your floor workers
they'd be able to tell a customer:

351
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,700
"Fuck off,
this isn't my department,"

352
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,900
is a pretty good argument
to vote yes on that union.

353
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,300
Honestly, that might be
worth it on its own.

354
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,460
And fun side note, those aren't
just actors, they're union actors,

355
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,700
members of the Screen Actors Guild.

356
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,940
That man later actually stressed
in an interview

357
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:20,100
that he's very much pro-union,
defending his appearance in the video

358
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:24,220
by saying: "If someone hires me to play
a rapist, does it make me a rapist?"

359
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,380
To which I have to respond:
"What?"

360
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,820
And: "I guess not, but... what?"

361
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,700
The most frightening and effective
argument against unions

362
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,300
isn't just that they'll keep you from
helping customers in other departments.

363
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,420
It's that they'll cost you your job.
Now, thankfully,

364
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,140
it is against the law for companies to
threaten workers that if they unionize,

365
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,780
their workplace will close.

366
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:53,740
However, hilariously, it is legal for
them to "predict" that it'll shut down.

367
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,420
Which is obviously
not a real distinction.

368
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,540
When a loan shark
threatens to break your legs,

369
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,180
that's not meaningfully different

370
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,820
from a loan shark predicting
that legs will be broken

371
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,020
as a result of market forces
relating to lack of payment.

372
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,340
And that "prediction loophole"
can let a lot through.

373
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,060
Columbia Sportswear
brought in a consultant

374
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,780
who freestyled
to a captive meeting of workers

375
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,180
about what could happen
if they unionize.

376
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,740
I've seen the worst of it.

377
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,940
Doesn't always end up
going so badly, but I mean,

378
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,020
I've seen people, you know,
just completely bankrupted.

379
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,300
- Marriages lost, homes lost...
- Company closing.

380
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,700
Yes, sometimes that happens, too.
I mean, look at Detroit.

381
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,860
All the auto workers there,

382
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:42,940
tens of thousands of employees
lost their jobs overnight.

383
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:49,140
A level of fearmongering rarely seen
outside abstinence-only sex ed class.

384
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,580
Don't join a union,

385
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,060
unless you want to end up pregnant,
divorced, homeless and Detroit.

386
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,020
It's not just Columbia Sportswear.
When workers at a tire company,

387
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,500
called Kumho,
tried to unionize a few years back,

388
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:06,140
12 different managers issued threats
to close the plant if the union won.

389
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,340
Which is undeniably scary.
And the thing is, it worked,

390
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,340
because even though 80 percent
of Kumho workers

391
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,260
had initially signed cards
supporting unionization,

392
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:21,500
when the vote happened, a month
later, 43 percent voted to organize.

393
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,780
And that is the thing. Threats that
a workplace will close are effective,

394
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,420
despite being
overwhelmingly bullshit.

395
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,940
One study found

396
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,940
"51 percent of companies threatened
to close plants if unions won,"

397
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:39,260
"while just 1 percent closed operations
after a union victory."

398
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,780
It is the same story again and again,
and it can be dispiriting

399
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,580
for those who know just how much good
a union could do for their coworkers.

400
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,460
Listen to a woman who tried
to organize her Nissan plant

401
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,860
talk about how it felt
watching her union drive fall apart.

402
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:00,300
When we started this,
my whole line they were just: "Yes."

403
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,740
But when Nissan started bringing in
those anti-union videos,

404
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:10,340
I seen my coworkers just:
"Betty, I just can't do it."

405
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:15,300
Yeah, and that is heartbreaking.
And even on the rare occasion

406
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,620
workers manage to overcome everything
you have seen and win their election,

407
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,860
the fight still might not be over.

408
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:26,060
As a study found, in a quarter
of all successful union elections,

409
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,340
getting a contract
can take three years or longer.

410
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,460
While companies are supposed
to bargain in good faith,

411
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,740
they can legally draw things out
to a ridiculous degree.

412
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,540
In 2009, some Texas employees
at Dish Network voted to unionize,

413
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,580
but over "a decade later,
they still have no contract."

414
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,940
And think about how long ago
2009 was.

415
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,900
Back then, the kids on "Modern Family"
looked like actual children,

416
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,980
none were engaged to the bartender
from "The Bachelor" franchise.

417
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,580
In 2009, the question
on everyone's lips was:

418
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:03,380
"Is the guy from 'Degrassi'
really rapping now?"

419
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,260
And you really want me
to transport you back to that time?

420
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,700
I've got two words for you.
Susan. Boyle.

421
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,780
Remember how her whole thing was:

422
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,580
"We didn't expect someone who
looked normal could sing good?"

423
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,580
The point here is,
2009 was a long time ago,

424
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,980
and that is how ridiculously
long the employees of Dish Network

425
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,500
have been waiting
for a fair union contract.

426
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,140
And that actually brings us
to the final problem here.

427
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,580
Because far too often,

428
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:31,220
the consequences for anti-union actions
by companies are minimal to none.

429
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:35,100
Companies aren't supposed to retaliate
against workers who unionize,

430
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,260
but it happens all the time.

431
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,060
Take Cynthia Harper, who worked
at a factory that made windshields.

432
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,180
After she spoke up
in favor of a union,

433
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,020
she had a sudden and pretty
suspicious change to her job.

434
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,700
Ever since they started this job,
it's been a two-man job.

435
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,620
When they put me out here on it,

436
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,540
they decided they wanted it
to be a one-person job.

437
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,380
When I would talk to HR,
I told them they were targeting me.

438
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,220
Putting me on a job to set me up

439
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,180
to write me up
for performance issues and fire me.

440
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,940
Okay, that's pretty brazen, isn't it?

441
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,860
They took a job clearly for two people
and made her do it on her own.

442
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,540
And if you're gonna set her up
for failure, why stop there?

443
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,740
Why not just give her everyone's job?
Why not send the entire factory home,

444
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,020
with a note saying "Relax, everyone,
Cynthia's got this."

445
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,900
And the thing is, she was right.
Soon after that, she was fired,

446
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,540
along with two other
pro-union coworkers.

447
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,460
But the consequences for a company
doing that are just pathetic.

448
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,780
A company that wrongfully terminates
a worker for supporting a union

449
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,980
might be forced
to provide back pay,

450
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,260
but that on its own is a pretty
small price for them to pay

451
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,100
if it helps them crush a union.

452
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,620
And other punishments
are even weaker,

453
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,260
like the fact that, and this is true,
a company can be ordered

454
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,100
to post a notice on the bulletin board,
in which it admits it violated the law,

455
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,580
but also, and this is crucial,
promises not to do it again.

456
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,180
And come on!
A company should probably face

457
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,540
more consequences
for illegally union busting

458
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,900
than this dog, who clearly likes
to hump this cat.

459
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,660
And honestly, in both cases,

460
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,740
I doubt the sign is going to change
the underlying problematic behavior.

461
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,980
So, it is no wonder that U.S. employers
are charged with violating federal law

462
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,860
in over 40 percent
of all union election campaigns,

463
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,540
because why wouldn't they?

464
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,460
Even when those charges are proven,
the consequences are laughable.

465
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,100
One anti-union consultant
has flat-out stated:

466
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,100
"What happens
if you violate the law?"

467
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,380
"The probability is
you will never get caught."

468
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:46,260
"If you do get caught, the worst thing
is you get a second election"

469
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:50,020
"and the employer
wins 96 percent of second elections."

470
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,620
And it's not great that union-busting
firms are telling companies that.

471
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,100
But it's even worse
that it's fucking true.

472
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,900
So, what can we do here?

473
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,300
Congress could step in to help
rebalance the playing field.

474
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,820
The Protecting the Right
to Organize Act, or PRO Act,

475
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:08,620
would outlaw captive audience meetings
and enable unionized workforces

476
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,260
to seek arbitration
to settle a first contract,

477
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,500
meaning that companies like Dish
can't give them the middle finger.

478
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,060
Also, and most importantly, it'd put
real financial penalties in place

479
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,220
to prevent companies from violating
workers' rights without consequence.

480
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,660
But until that law is passed,
and it should pass,

481
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,580
one of the most important things
for workers to do

482
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,780
is to not get disheartened during
a campaign, which I know isn't easy.

483
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:37,020
But union busting is all about
killing momentum, splintering unity

484
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,820
and exhausting workers' spirits.

485
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,340
To the extent that it helps,

486
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,940
if you're in a workplace
that's unionizing right now,

487
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,220
and you're feeling pressured
or personally attacked,

488
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,660
remember, the company is almost
certainly following a script.

489
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,860
And you don't have to play the part
that they want you to.

490
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,380
And if, by some chance,

491
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,460
you're a corporate executive
who's made it this far into the show,

492
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,380
first, I'm almost impressed
that you're still here.

493
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,180
But second, please stop wasting money
on these anti-union consulting firms.

494
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,980
Instead, just use this video
that we made for you.

495
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,580
It's a lot cheaper, and it says
exactly what you really mean.

496
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,180
Unions:
Don't even fucking think about it!

497
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,940
Hello. Thanks for watching
this mandatory company video.

498
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,540
You're here because someone may
have approached you about unionizing.

499
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,540
Or asked you to sign a union card.

500
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,260
Or simply said the words "living wage"
anywhere on company grounds.

501
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,740
Look, a union may work
for a lot of places,

502
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,980
but the thing is, here, we're a family
and you employees are children.

503
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,700
So, let's listen in on some
worker conversations.

504
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,780
Something we definitely
don't do in real life.

505
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,300
Bob! Did you know
if we brought on a union,

506
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,300
it'd be illegal for us
to talk to our bosses anymore.

507
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:54,740
No way. There's two things I love:
talking directly to my shift supervisor

508
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,220
and helping customers who are
in departments I don't work in.

509
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,860
Bad news, Bob. If the union
came in, you couldn't do that.

510
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,780
If a customer who's outside of
your department asks you a question,

511
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,860
you're legally required
to tell them to go fuck themselves.

512
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,980
If they ask a follow-up question, you'd
have to slap them with an open hand.

513
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,300
So, everyone gets hurt.
Everyone, except the union.

514
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,740
How could the union
possibly benefit from...

515
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,220
We don't think a union
is right for our workplace,

516
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,860
but ultimately, the choice
is always up to our employees.

517
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,980
We promise, no one will be fired
for wanting to unionize.

518
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,020
There is a chance you might
be fired for poor attendance.

519
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,620
A pretty good chance, actually.

520
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,940
But you won't be fired
explicitly for the union thing.

521
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,500
That's how we do it.

522
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,460
For the next few weeks,

523
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,860
you might notice a few extra
posters around the workplace.

524
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,780
In break rooms, stock rooms,
bathrooms

525
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,300
or glued to the back of a coworker.

526
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,860
You already went
to the bathroom, Ted.

527
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,140
These are just there
to tell you things.

528
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:59,540
Like how expensive
union dues are. 700 dollars?

529
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,020
Think of what else
you could buy with that.

530
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,580
Like a Nintendo Wii
with all the latest hits.

531
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,500
Or, I don't know, what else
do poor people like?

532
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,980
Poor people...

533
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,260
I know I've seen poor people.

534
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,340
Drugs. Buy and eat drugs!

535
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,860
Did you know when a union
enters a negotiation,

536
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,740
our wages could go up
or they could go down?

537
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,420
- Wait, our wages could go up?
- But they could go down.

538
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,260
- Realistically, they'll go up.
- But they could go down.

539
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,740
Without a union, what's stopping
them from going down now?

540
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,180
But they could go down.

541
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,380
Right, just technically speaking...

542
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,060
I want to talk to you
about your attendance.

543
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:46,620
Just remember, when it comes
to unions, the choice is yours.

544
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,580
When it comes to watching videos
like this about unions,

545
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,380
the choice is very much ours.

546
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,820
Did I say stop waving?

547
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,980
Moving on. Finally, tonight,
this is our last show of the season.

548
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,740
And it has been a tricky year.
We began it still stuck in the void

549
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:10,300
before finally managing to move
into this studio in September.

550
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,660
Despite the fact that we've been having
to operate under Covid restrictions,

551
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,820
we have still managed
to have some fun.

552
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,500
We infiltrated local news broadcasts
to sell a vaginal healing blanket,

553
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,060
we sold 10 000 teddy bears
to annoy a Belarusian strongman,

554
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:27,860
we entered a duck stamp contest and
were absolutely robbed on that.

555
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,420
We started our own
health care sharing ministry,

556
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:35,860
we forced a Minnesota car dealership
to produce the finest local car ad.

557
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:40,220
George Clooney appeared on the show
every time I snapped my fingers

558
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,620
and we almost welcomed a vaccine
cicada into our family of mascots,

559
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:48,260
which would have been the single
dumbest thing we have ever done.

560
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,700
We invited the vaccine cicada
to the final show tonight

561
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,020
in a "make it or break it" situation.

562
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:58,140
If he could do a dance in all the right
ways, maybe he'd deserve to be here.

563
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,540
But then we realized,
he deserves shit,

564
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,260
he's a dollar store beetle
in a crop top.

565
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,940
So, we sent him a text
telling him that the gig's off,

566
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,140
but he probably can't even hold a phone
in his, what are those, pinchers?

567
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,180
Idiot!

568
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,980
Look, the point is,
it was definitely a strange year.

569
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,940
And despite being back
in the studio, the fact is,

570
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,980
I still haven't seen most of
my staff since March of 2020.

571
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,700
Though I am definitely
looking forward to next year,

572
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:30,700
it has been difficult spending so much
of this one in isolation.

573
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,940
The truth is, it does
sometimes get me down a bit.

574
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,020
But you know what? I think
I actually might know someone

575
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,740
who could help me
feel a little bit better.

576
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,780
- Hey, John, what's up?
- Hey, George.

577
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:47,900
I was thinking about the things
I wanted to do but haven't been able to

578
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,820
and all the people that I wanted
to see, but couldn't. You know?

579
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,500
Yeah.
You're feeling down, huh?

580
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:57,620
Yeah. You could say
it's an intolerable cruelty.

581
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,260
So, what kind of reaction
did you want from me on that?

582
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:06,340
I don't know. I was hoping that you
might be able to cheer me up a bit.

583
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:13,820
Yeah. I'm not supposed to do this,
but you seem more pathetic than usual.

584
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,140
That's harsh, but also fair.

585
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,940
For the next few minutes,

586
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:22,060
I'm going to give you the power to
summon any celebrity with that snap.

587
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,660
Really? George,
that is absolutely fantastic news.

588
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,020
Thank you so much!
I promise I will not misuse this power.

589
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,380
Yes, you will. But the beauty is,
you only have a few minutes, so, go!

590
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,900
I mean, this is great!
This is so exciting!

591
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:41,180
I feel slightly better already,
but let's not waste any time on this.

592
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,860
Let's see who we get first!

593
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,300
Jennifer Coolidge!
Jennifer, hi!

594
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,980
Look!
It's Jimmy Kimmel!

595
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,580
No, it's not. It's John.
My name's John.

596
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,260
- Jimmy, I love your show.
- Thanks.

597
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,380
Do you want me
to do a mean Tweet?

598
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:03,100
- That's a different show, Jennifer.
- Is Questlove there?

599
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,100
That's a different Jimmy.

600
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:11,340
- Wait, are you the British one?
- Yes! That's me!

601
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,540
I'm the British one!
Yeah, that's me!

602
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,740
Do you want me
to get in a car and sing?

603
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,300
For fuck's sake.

604
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:23,180
- Hey, Will! How're you doing?
- Hey, John, what now?

605
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,060
I've got a really funny story for you.
George Clooney gave me the power

606
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,060
to summon any celebrity that I want
with the snap of a finger.

607
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,020
He did that again? He gives
that power away to anyone.

608
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,500
Last week I got summoned by a guy
who sold Clooney a pack of Trident.

609
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:40,220
That makes me feel significantly
less special.

610
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,020
RuPaul! Hey, Ru!

611
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:47,940
I'm sorry, my dear, but it's time
for you to sashay away.

612
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,620
I'm not a contestant on your show.
It's me! It's John Oliver.

613
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,860
I thought it was one of the queens
dressed up as a marionette doll.

614
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,420
No, Ru.
Just me and my actual human body.

615
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,220
Cute.

616
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,340
I mean, that was fun.
That was definitely fun.

617
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,740
But I guess there is no point
in stopping if we've still got time.

618
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,540
Let's see who else we can get.
Holy shit! Cardi B!

619
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,660
- Hi, Cardi!
- Who said that?

620
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,700
- I'm John, but...
- Alexa?

621
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:23,260
No, not Alexa, I'm John Oliver.
It's lovely to meet you.

622
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:27,580
- I never thought we'd get to speak...
- Alexa? FBI?

623
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,900
Forget it.

624
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:35,860
Surprise! Listen, your little
brother Billy reached out to me

625
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,060
and told me that it is your birthday.

626
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:44,420
This is freaking huge.
That's what she said!

627
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,740
- Brian, sorry...
- Holy shit.

628
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,220
No. The Cameos never talk back.

629
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,260
Yeah, Brian, I think
there's been a misunderstanding,

630
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,140
I didn't order a Cameo from you,

631
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,740
I snapped my fingers
and now we're talking...

632
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:01,860
John, if this isn't a Cameo,
just get the fuck out of my phone.

633
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,540
Kevin from "The Office"
does not mess around.

634
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,620
All right, one more push.
Here it goes!

635
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,980
Cardi, it's me again.
Sorry. I'm sorry, Cardi.

636
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:17,260
Siri, tell Alexa to stop.
Alexa, stop.

637
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,380
There's nothing to stop here.

638
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,900
I've got it, don't worry.

639
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,020
Void!
Void, great to see you!

640
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,980
Hey, John. Decent to see you, as well.
I can't really talk at the moment,

641
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,620
I'm hosting my own talk show now.

642
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,300
- Really?
- Yeah, kinda busy.

643
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,540
That's great!

644
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,180
Yeah, apparently HBO Max
liked the vibe of this space

645
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:39,180
and they just thought it would be
better suited for a comedy show.

646
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,820
- And not what you were doing.
- I get it. You're being mean to me.

647
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,580
Thank goodness. Leslie,
I'm so glad it's you.

648
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,380
- Nah!
- What do you mean, no?

649
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,340
What are you talking about, no?
Hey, it's John. Leslie...

650
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,420
I don't want this.
I don't want to be part of this.

651
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,260
- Alakazam.
- Part of what? We're just talking.

652
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,340
- How do I get rid of you? Go away!
- Don't clap me away!

653
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,620
It's not even a clap anyway,
it's a snap!

654
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,300
You've just got to snap your fingers.
Just snap your finger.

655
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,420
- The white man won't leave!
- I will, I'll leave!

656
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,420
Time's up! How was it, John?

657
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,780
People were pretty relentlessly
mean to me, George. But honestly?

658
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,140
- It was kind of great.
- I knew it would be.

659
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,780
Remember, just because this year didn't
work out like you thought it would,

660
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,220
that doesn't mean that shamelessly
bringing in celebrities for the finale

661
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,620
wouldn't cheer you up.

662
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,180
Becauseý Say it with me!

663
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,380
Celebrities make
everything better,

664
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,580
except in the many situations
where they do not.

665
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,060
- That's right. And hey, John.
- What?

666
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,900
Goodnight and good luck.

667
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,740
That's it. I do feel
20 percent better now, at least.

668
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,500
Thank you so much
for watching our show this year.

669
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,620
We all really appreciate it.
We'll see you next year.

670
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,900
Please stay safe until then.
Goodnight!

671
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,860
Do you want me to get in a car
and sing?

672
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,820
I'm a smooth operator.

673
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,260
Thank you.

674
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,940
You ain't no hollaback, y'all!

675
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,140
Thank you.

676
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,620
I don't know.

677
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:32,140
Hey, everybody, welcome
to "White Void Tonight".

678
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,820
I'm the void. Let's dive straight in
with the key question of the week:

679
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,180
what went wrong
with "Space Jam 2"?

680
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,940
People think the main flaw was
LeBron's acting, but the key issue

681
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:46,260
was its fundamental misunderstanding
of Bugs Bunny as a character.

682
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,980
The climax involves
Bugs Bunny learning a lesson?

683
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,060
Bugs Bunny doesn't learn lessons.

684
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,540
Let those fucking nerds
at Pixar learn lessons.

685
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,100
Sorry. Excuse me.

686
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,060
Is your entire show breaking down
your problems with "Space Jam 2"?

687
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,980
No, this is just the fun bit
at the top of the show.

688
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,660
There's also a main story coming up.

689
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,780
It just seems like a weird way
to start a show, is all.

690
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,980
Excuse me?

691
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:15,620
You're the one who does 20-minute
monologues about factory farming.

692
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,140
So, maybe take a look at yourself.

693
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,340
- Fair enough. All right. Carry on.
- If you don't mind.

694
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,380
- You want me to...
- Go ahead. Go.

695
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,660
Have a good show.

696
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,340
- Bye.
- I'm leaving.

697
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,780
Sorry about that, folks. Anyway,
our main story concerns jet fuel.

698
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,220
- No!
- Specifically the fact it can't...

699
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,860
- Don't you do it! Void.
- ... melt steel beams.

700
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,940
- Because 9/11 was an inside job!
- No!
