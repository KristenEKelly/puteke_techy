1
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,500
HI, THERE!

2
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:30,233
WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

3
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,533
OUR SECOND TO LAST ONE

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,366
INCIDENTALLY TAKING PLACE IN

5
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:33,666
THIS BLANK VOID.

6
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:34,933
HEY, EVERYBODY.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,700
HEY.

8
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:38,566
HEY, JOHN.

9
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:40,566
I HAVE BEEN THINKING A LOT

10
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:43,033
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, YOU AND I IN

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,933
THE LAST FEW WEEKS, AND I, YOU

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,633
KNOW, I AM A VOID.

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,233
SOMETIMES I CAN BE CANTANKEROUS

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,733
IF YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,885
BUT I DO WANT TO SAY, I ACTUALLY

16
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:54,633
WILL MISS YOU WHEN YOU'RE GONE.

17
00:00:56,026 --> 00:00:57,092
WAIT, REALLY?

18
00:00:57,117 --> 00:00:58,117
NO!

19
00:00:58,142 --> 00:00:58,608
NOT AT ALL!

20
00:00:58,633 --> 00:00:59,466
RIGHT.

21
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:02,766
TOTALLY JOKING!

22
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,433
YEP.

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,351
BYE, I HATE YOU.

24
00:01:06,376 --> 00:01:06,876
Get out!

25
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:07,701
I FIGURED.

26
00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:08,792
WHAT A FUCKING IDIOT.

27
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:09,300
MOVING ON!

28
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:09,900
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK IN

29
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:10,466
AFGHANISTAN.

30
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:15,533
THE TALIBAN NOW CONTROLS

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,200
HALF OF THE COUNTRY'S PROVINCIAL

32
00:01:16,266 --> 00:01:16,700
CAPITALS.

33
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:17,666
IN NEW YORK, ANDREW CUOMO

34
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:18,533
RESIGNED IN DISGRACE OR AS

35
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,633
CHRIS CUOMO MIGHT SAY...

36
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,700
BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

37
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:22,433
THE CORONAVIRUS.

38
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:22,966
BECAUSE SADLY, OUR

39
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:23,900
HOT VAX SUMMER SEEMS TO BE

40
00:01:23,966 --> 00:01:24,766
GIVING WAY TO DIPSHIT AUTUMN

41
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:25,766
AS THE DELTA VARIANT IS

42
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:26,766
SPREADING WILDLY AROUND

43
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,866
THE COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY

44
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:30,266
AMONG THE UNVACCINATED,

45
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,700
WITH THE U.S. AVERAGING AROUND

46
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:33,966
100,000 NEW INFECTIONS A DAY.

47
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:35,300
AND ALARMINGLY, ROUGHLY 15% OF

48
00:01:35,366 --> 00:01:37,266
NEW CASES OUR CHILDREN, WITH

49
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,833
OVER 250 KIDS BEING NEWLY

50
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,700
HOSPITALIZED EACH DAY.

51
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:42,400
AND ALL OF THIS MEANS THAT MANY

52
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:43,900
HOSPITALS ARE YET AGAIN BEING

53
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:46,100
STRETCHED TO THE BREAKING POINT,

54
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,733
PARTICULARLY IN CERTAIN PARTS OF

55
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,333
THE COUNTRY, WITH FLORIDA AND

56
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,600
TEXAS ALONE ACCOUNTING FOR

57
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,300
40% OF NEW HOSPITALIZATIONS AND

58
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,733
THE RESPONSE OF FLORIDA'S

59
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,400
GOVERNOR HAS BEEN UNDERWHELMING.

60
00:01:58,466 --> 00:01:59,542
TODAY, FLORIDA'S GOVERNOR

61
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:00,576
CONCEDED THINGS MAY LOOK BAD.

62
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,840
WE ARE SEEING PEOPLE TESTING

63
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,300
POSITIVE IN HIGHER NUMBERS THAN

64
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:04,066
I THINK MOST PEOPLE

65
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:06,633
ANTICIPATED.

66
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,600
DEAL WITH

67
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:08,266
IT.

68
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,033
IT'S AIRBORNE.

69
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,566
IT'S AEROSOLIZED.

70
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:12,200
AND SO WE JUST HAVE TO

71
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:13,166
UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN THAT'S

72
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,533
HAPPENING, THESE WAVES ARE

73
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,640
SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO

74
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,066
DEAL WITH.

75
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:19,266
WOW, THE WORLD CHANGES

76
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,866
SO QUICKLY, DOESN'T IT?

77
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:21,766
IF YOU HAD TOLD ME JUST

78
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:22,876
A FEW YEARS AGO THAT FLORIDA'S

79
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,900
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR WOULD

80
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:25,866
RESPOND TO A DEADLY THREAT WITH

81
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:27,009
"THESE WAVES ARE SOMETHING YOU

82
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:28,200
JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH," I'D

83
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:29,342
HAVE ASSUMED THEY WERE TALKING

84
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:31,000
ABOUT MIAMI SINKING INTO A

85
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:32,500
WARMING OCEAN, NOT A COMPLETELY

86
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:34,166
DIFFERENT, TOTALLY SELF-INDUCED

87
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:35,533
CRISIS.

88
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,166
AND IT'S PRETTY TOUGH TO HEAR

89
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:38,700
THIS CUT-RATE COACH TAYLOR

90
00:02:38,766 --> 00:02:39,909
SAYING, "JUST DEAL WITH IT" WHEN

91
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:40,733
HE SEEMS TO BE VERY MUCH NOT

92
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,866
DOING THAT.

93
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:43,633
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO, DeSANTIS

94
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,300
ISSUED AN ORDER BANNING SCHOOL

95
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,266
MASK MANDATES... MAKING FLORIDA

96
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,409
ONE OF AT LEAST SEVEN STATES

97
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:49,266
NOW PROHIBITING SCHOOLS FROM

98
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,766
IMPOSING THEM.

99
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,833
AND SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGS AROUND

100
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,976
THE COUNTRY HAVE SEEN FIERY

101
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,366
EXCHANGES ABOUT THIS ISSUE.

102
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:56,800
IN NORTH CAROLINA,

103
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:58,076
REPRESENTATIVE MADISON CAWTHORN

104
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,342
SHOWED UP TO ONE, TO DO WHATEVER

105
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:00,966
THIS IS.

106
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:02,433
THE GREATEST THREAT TO OUR

107
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,266
CHILDREN TODAY DOES NOT COME

108
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,000
FROM COVID-19.

109
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:06,300
IT COMES FROM WOKE, LIBERAL

110
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:07,566
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS LIKE YOU

111
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:08,466
WHO THINK THEY ARE ALL KNOWING

112
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:12,633
AND ALL WISE.

113
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,066
I'M A DIRECT DESCENDANT OF

114
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:17,700
ABRAHAM KUYKENDALL, ONE OF THE

115
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:19,433
FIRST MEN TO SETTLE THIS COUNTY.

116
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,433
HE KNEW HARDSHIP FIRSTHAND.

117
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,433
HE DID NOT ENDURE THAT HARDSHIP

118
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,676
JUST SO A WOKE SCHOOL BOARD CAN

119
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,500
BEGIN TO SYSTEMATICALLY STRIP

120
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:28,400
THE RESPONSIBILITY FROM THE

121
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:34,666
HANDS OF PARENTS AND GUARDIANS

122
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:34,800
O

123
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:35,633
TO DETERMINE WHAT TO HAPPENS

124
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,133
WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

125
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,500
WOW.

126
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:38,766
SO MADISON CAWTHORN THINKS THE

127
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,200
BIGGEST THREAT TO CHILDREN IS

128
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:41,066
SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS WHO THINK

129
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:41,666
THEY'RE OMNISCIENT.

130
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:42,733
I'D SAY I WAS SURPRISED,

131
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:43,700
BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO ONCE

132
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:44,600
POSTED THIS VIDEO OF HIMSELF

133
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:45,500
BEATING UP A TREE.

134
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:46,642
SO HE CLEARLY LOVES TO PICK

135
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:47,233
USELESS FIGHTS AGAINST IMAGINARY

136
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,233
OPPONENTS WHERE HE COMES OUT

137
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,000
LOOKING LIKE A COMPLETE ASSHOLE.

138
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,033
ALSO, A QUICK SIDE NOTE ABOUT

139
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,533
HIM BRAGGING ABOUT BEING

140
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,366
A DESCENDANT OF

141
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:56,500
ABRAHAM KUYKENDALL.

142
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:57,233
NOT ONLY DOES THAT LAST NAME

143
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,133
SOUND LIKE THE SWEDISH

144
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,133
TRANSLATION FOR BRATZ DOLLS,

145
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,733
FOR THE RECORD,

146
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,533
ABRAHAM KIRKENDALL... WHICH IS

147
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,233
HOW IT'S ACTUALLY PRONOUNCED...

148
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:05,733
WAS ONE OF THE EARLIEST

149
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,809
SLAVE OWNERS IN THE COUNTY.

150
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,000
SO NEXT TIME YOU'RE TRYING TO

151
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:08,766
PROVE A POINT ABOUT HOW PARENTS

152
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:09,633
SHOULD DECIDE WHAT'S BEST FOR

153
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,233
THEIR KIDS, MAYBE DON'T USE

154
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,466
A GUY WHO DECIDED THE BEST THING

155
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:14,773
FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S KIDS WAS FOR

156
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,566
HIM TO OWN THEM.

157
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:17,633
AND THAT WAS BY NO MEANS

158
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,809
THE ONLY WILDLY INAPPROPRIATE

159
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:22,733
HISTORICAL REFERENCE DURING

160
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,166
A DEBATE THIS WEEK.

161
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:23,900
JUST AFTER THE FOX CHAPEL

162
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:25,109
SCHOOL BOARD VOTED FOR STUDENTS

163
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:26,033
TO WEAR MASKS AS THE NEW SCHOOL

164
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,140
YEAR BEGINS, PEOPLE AT THE

165
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,533
MEETING STARTED ARGUING WITH

166
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,166
THE BOARD, BEFORE THIS PERSON

167
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:32,066
APPEARS TO FLASH A NAZI SALUTE

168
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:34,133
AT THE BOARD.

169
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,866
THE HOLOCAUST CENTER OF

170
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:36,133
PITTSBURGH SAYS THERE IS

171
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
NO COMPARISON BETWEEN

172
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:37,933
THE HOLOCAUST AND MASKING

173
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,400
CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS.

174
00:04:40,466 --> 00:04:42,200
OKAY, I APPRECIATE

175
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:43,033
THE EFFORT, BUT YOU REALLY DID

176
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,233
NOT NEED TO ASK THE HOLOCAUST

177
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,500
CENTER TO FACT CHECK THAT.

178
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:48,566
FOR THE SAME REASON YOU DON'T

179
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:49,100
NEED TO CONTACT AN AFRICAN

180
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:49,600
STUDIES CENTER TO ASK IF

181
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:50,566
THE RWANDAN GENOCIDE WAS AS

182
00:04:50,633 --> 00:04:52,000
BAD AS GETTING A POPCORN KERNEL

183
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:53,333
STUCK IN YOUR TEETH.

184
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,866
IF YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW THE

185
00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:56,166
ANSWER, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND

186
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:56,833
EITHER OF THE THINGS YOU'RE

187
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,033
COMPARING.

188
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,666
AND LOOK, WHEN TEMPERS ARE THIS

189
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,800
HIGH, IT CAN BE HARD TO SORT

190
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:02,633
THINGS THROUGH IN A NUANCED WAY,

191
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,833
BUT LET'S TRY.

192
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,300
BECAUSE FIRST, WE CAN AGREE:

193
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:07,566
FOR MOST KIDS, IN-PERSON

194
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:09,166
SCHOOLING IS VASTLY PREFERABLE

195
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:11,933
TO THE ONLINE KIND.

196
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,833
THE QUESTION IS, HOW TO DO IT

197
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,733
SAFELY.

198
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,366
AND THOSE OPPOSED TO

199
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:16,366
MASK MANDATES ARGUE THAT,

200
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:17,593
SINCE COVID CASES IN CHILDREN

201
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:19,100
HAVE TENDED TO BE MILD... WHICH

202
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,400
IS, THANKFULLY, TRUE... THE

203
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:21,866
DOWNSIDES OF THEM WEARING MASKS

204
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:25,866
OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS.

205
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:27,433
BUT THAT IS A BIG SWING.

206
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,200
THERE IS STILL SO MUCH WE DON'T

207
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:30,100
KNOW ABOUT HOW LONG-TERM COVID,

208
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,242
AND THE DELTA VARIANT, AFFECT

209
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:32,600
KIDS.

210
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,466
AND WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT

211
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:36,700
COVID IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE

212
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:37,600
DEADLY FOR ADULTS, AND IN MANY

213
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,766
COMMUNITIES, FOR SOME FUCKING

214
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:40,873
REASON, THERE ARE A LOT OF

215
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:41,833
UNVACCINATED ADULTS TO WHOM KIDS

216
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,100
COULD TRANSMIT THE VIRUS.

217
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,376
BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE ANY OF

218
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,900
THAT NUANCE IS BEING FACTORED

219
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:48,433
INTO THIS DISCUSSION,

220
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,433
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU SEE SCENES

221
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,733
LIKE PEOPLE BEING HARASSED

222
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,166
OUTSIDE THIS TENNESSEE SCHOOL

223
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:53,500
BOARD MEETING, WITH A MAN WHO

224
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:54,466
SPOKE IN FAVOR OF MASK

225
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:56,266
REQUIREMENTS BEING CONFRONTED

226
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:58,033
EVERYBODY'S TAKING NOTES,

227
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,433
BUDDY!

228
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,300
KEEP THAT LITTLE SMILE.

229
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:02,366
WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE!

230
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:03,476
YOU CAN LEAVE FREELY BUT WE WILL

231
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,542
FIND YOU AND WE KNOW WHO YOU

232
00:06:04,566 --> 00:06:05,766
ARE.

233
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:10,033
WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

234
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,466
HOLY SHIT.

235
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:12,542
IT'S GENUINELY HARD TO IMAGINE

236
00:06:12,566 --> 00:06:13,933
A FIVE-WORD PHRASE LESS WELCOME

237
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,733
THAN "WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE,"

238
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,133
ASIDE FROM, OBVIOUSLY, "NEW

239
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,500
"JEOPARDY" HOST MIKE RICHARDS."

240
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:20,066
AND LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING MASKS,

241
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:21,266
IN AND OF THEMSELVES,

242
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,500
ARE A PERFECT SHIELD AGAINST

243
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:24,600
TRANSMISSION.

244
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:25,666
THEY'RE NOT!

245
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:26,666
EXPERTS ARGUE THEY SHOULD BE

246
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:28,133
PART OF A LAYERED APPROACH...

247
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,700
LIKE ENSURING PROPER VENTILATION

248
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:30,776
IN SCHOOLS, MAINTAINING SOCIAL

249
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,933
DISTANCING, AND REQUIRING THAT

250
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,833
EVERYONE IN A SCHOOL WHO CAN GET

251
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,300
A VACCINE DOES.

252
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:41,233
THE PROBLEM IS, IT'S NOT LIKE

253
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,542
SOME OF THESE STATES ARE SAYING,

254
00:06:42,566 --> 00:06:44,166
"OKAY, WE'LL TAKE EVERY

255
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:45,133
REASONABLE PRECAUTION, EXCEPT

256
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,000
FOR MASKS."

257
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:46,800
BECAUSE IN TEXAS, THEY'RE DOING

258
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:47,666
THIS.

259
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:48,533
THE TEXAS EDUCATION AGENCY

260
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,300
RELEASED NEW GUIDANCE REGARDING

261
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:50,566
COVID-19 AND SCHOOLS.

262
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:52,133
UNDER THE NEW GUIDELINES,

263
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,066
SCHOOLS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO

264
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:56,300
INFORM PARENTS OF A POSITIVE

265
00:06:56,366 --> 00:06:58,166
CASE, SCHOOLS DO NOT HAVE TO

266
00:06:58,233 --> 00:06:59,342
CONDUCT CONTACT TRACING, AND

267
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:01,000
IF A SCHOOL DOES CONTACT TRACE,

268
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:02,533
PARENTS CAN STILL SEND THEIR

269
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,166
CHILD TO SCHOOL IF THEY ARE

270
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:05,466
A CLOSE CONTACT OF AN INFECTED

271
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:08,666
STUDENT.

272
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:09,266
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU

273
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,833
DOING?

274
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,433
THE PHRASE, "EVERYTHING'S BIGGER

275
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,509
IN TEXAS" IS SUPPOSED TO REFER

276
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:15,200
TO MEAT, TRUCKS, AND BELT

277
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:16,166
BUCKLES, NOT "THE MARKET FOR

278
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:18,433
CHILD-SIZED VENTILATORS."

279
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,966
AND I KNOW SOME KIDS LITERALLY

280
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:21,700
CAN'T WEAR A MASK ALL DAY.

281
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:23,433
BUT THAT'S ALL THE MORE REASON

282
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,566
THAT, UNTIL TRANSMISSION IS IN

283
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:28,100
CHECK, ANYONE WHO CAN, DOES.

284
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,266
AND BOTH THE CDC AND THE

285
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,476
AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS

286
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,900
REPRESENTING NEARLY 70,000

287
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:35,000
DOCTORS... ARE ARGUING FOR

288
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:36,109
UNIVERSAL INDOOR MASKING FOR

289
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:37,300
KIDS.

290
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:39,366
AND THE THING IS, YOU CAN'T HELP

291
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:40,833
THINKING THAT SOME OF THE FUSS

292
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,133
OVER MASKS IS MORE ABOUT

293
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,900
PARENTS THAN IT IS ABOUT THEIR

294
00:07:42,966 --> 00:07:44,800
KIDS.

295
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:45,906
IN FACT, JUST WATCH AS ONE

296
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,533
BASICALLY ADMITS THAT.

297
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,133
WELL, I MEAN, HONESTLY,

298
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,033
IT'S JUST CRAZY.

299
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,066
I MEAN, LAST TIME I CHECKED,

300
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:53,400
THIS IS AMERICA, AND YOU CAN'T

301
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:54,300
MAKE ANYBODY DO ANYTHING.

302
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:55,300
I MEAN, I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT

303
00:07:55,366 --> 00:07:57,100
PEOPLE DIED FOR, OUR FREEDOM.

304
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,533
LAST YEAR, HE DID HAVE TO WEAR

305
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,000
A MASK, AND YOU KNOW, HONESTLY,

306
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:02,566
HE THINKS IT'S COOL.

307
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:03,366
I'M GONNA JUST... I'M NOT GONNA

308
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:04,033
LIE, YOU KNOW, HE THINKS HE'S A

309
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,800
NINJA.

310
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:05,876
AND I SAY, "SON, DON'T... DON'T

311
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,533
SAY THAT, WHEN THEY... WHEN THEY

312
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,366
ASK YOU IF YOU LIKE TO WEAR A

313
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:07,633
MASK."

314
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,366
BUT, YOU KNOW.

315
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:09,542
IT DOESN'T REALLY AFFECT HIM,

316
00:08:09,566 --> 00:08:10,700
I GUESS, RIGHT NOW, BUT,

317
00:08:10,766 --> 00:08:11,433
YOU KNOW, HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT'S

318
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,300
GOING ON.

319
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,200
OH, COME ON!

320
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:15,100
IF YOUR KID HAPPENS TO LIKE

321
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,409
WEARING A MASK, LET THEM FUCKING

322
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:17,300
WEAR IT!

323
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:18,766
DO YOU REALIZE HOW RARE IT IS

324
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,166
FOR A CHILD TO VOLUNTARILY DO

325
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,766
SOMETHING THAT'S A NET POSITIVE

326
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,933
FOR PUBLIC HEALTH?

327
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,333
KIDS ARE NORMALLY JUST MOVING

328
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,633
SNOT DISPENSARIES THAT RUN

329
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,133
AROUND COUGHING ON DOOR KNOBS,

330
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,266
AND SNEEZING DIRECTLY INTO

331
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,100
PEOPLE'S MOUTHS.

332
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,033
LOOK, THE KEY THING TO REMEMBER

333
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,033
IS THAT THE ABSOLUTE BEST THING

334
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,666
WE CAN DO TO KEEP COVID FROM

335
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:37,866
SPREADING IN SCHOOLS ISN'T

336
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:38,466
SIMPLY PUTTING MASKS ON

337
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:39,866
CHILDREN.

338
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:41,800
IT'S FOR THE WHOLE COMMUNITY

339
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:42,500
SURROUNDING THAT SCHOOL TO BE

340
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:47,366
VACCINATED.

341
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:48,133
IT IS NO COINCIDENCE THAT THE

342
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,276
FIRST LARGE WAVE OF COVID CASES

343
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,433
IN CHILDREN IS HITTING

344
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,033
LOW-VACCINATION STATES.

345
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,366
SO YOU REALLY WANT TO PROTECT

346
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:53,900
THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN AND

347
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,266
THE COMMUNITY THEY LIVE IN?

348
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,600
HERE'S YOUR FUCKING ANSWER:

349
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,433
WE ARE ONLY FIGHTING ABOUT MASKS

350
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,100
IN SCHOOLS BECAUSE THERE ARE

351
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,066
A BUNCH OF FOOLISH ADULTS THAT

352
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:02,900
HAVE DECIDED NOT TO GET THE

353
00:09:02,966 --> 00:09:04,233
VACCINE.

354
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,866
AND TO ALL OF THEM, I CAN ONLY

355
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:06,700
SAY... TO QUOTE A BUNCH OF

356
00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:10,000
UPSETTINGLY LOUD IDIOTS...

357
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:11,000
"WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE" AND YOU'RE

358
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:12,400
THE FUCKING PROBLEM.

359
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:13,466
AND NOW, THIS.

360
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:20,800
AND NOW...

361
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:23,666
PETE NELSON FROM "TREE HOUSE

362
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:24,266
MASTERS" REALLY, REALLY LIKES

363
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,333
TREES.

364
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,866
BOY, THIS IS A GREAT LOOKING

365
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:30,200
TREE, THESE MAPLES.

366
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:30,833
A POPLAR.

367
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,366
A LOT OF PINE.

368
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:34,033
OAK TREES.

369
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,433
EASTERN HEMLOCKS.

370
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:38,166
LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL TUNNEL OF

371
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:38,833
LOVE.

372
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,300
LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THIS

373
00:09:41,366 --> 00:09:41,733
GORGEOUS, BIG OAK!

374
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,833
I WOULD RATHER BE IN A TREE THAT

375
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,633
IS IN ITS ADOLESCENT YEARS, IF

376
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,233
YOU WILL.

377
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,800
HAVING JUST SAID THAT, IF THERE

378
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:49,600
IS A BIG, BEAUTIFUL MATURE OAK

379
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,600
THAT HAS CLEARLY BEEN AROUND A

380
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:52,876
LONG TIME, YOU GET SO ATTRACTED

381
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,600
TO THOSE TOO THAT YOU CAN'T HELP

382
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,233
YOURSELF.

383
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:56,733
THERE WAS A LITTLE

384
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,333
COMMUNICATION THERE BETWEEN ME

385
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,033
AND THE BIG GUY THAT WAS LIKE,

386
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,900
LET'S DO THIS.

387
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,233
IT IS ASKING FOR IT.

388
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,100
IT WANTS US TO BE HERE.

389
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,406
I SAW THEM EARLIER BUT I DIDN'T

390
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:06,566
WANT TO JUMP HER BONES RIGHT

391
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:06,800
AWAY.

392
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:07,866
THESE ARE REGAL.

393
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:09,366
IT'S THE KING OF THE FOREST.

394
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:11,533
WE HAVE HAD THIS THING GOING

395
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,766
FOR ABOUT SEVEN YEARS.

396
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,233
I THINK IT SENSES THAT NOW IS

397
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:15,500
THE TIME.

398
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:17,200
MY TREE JUICES ARE PUMPING.

399
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:20,066
I AM FEELING SOMETHING REALLY

400
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:21,033
GOOD RIGHT IN HERE.

401
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,166
I AM BUZZING RIGHT NOW.

402
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:24,566
FEELS REALLY GOOD.

403
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:26,200
THIS FEELS GREAT.

404
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:29,866
THIS IS FANTASTIC.

405
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:31,433
OH!

406
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,300
MOVING ON.

407
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,133
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

408
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,833
THE INTERNET.

409
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,909
IT IS A HORRIBLE PLACE THAT

410
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:37,000
EVERYONE HATES, WHICH IS A

411
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:37,966
LITTLE WEIRD, AS IT'S GIVEN US

412
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:38,800
ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT WE WERE

413
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:39,866
PROMISED IN THIS NEARLY

414
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:41,333
PRESCIENT AD FROM 1993.

415
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,833
HAVE YOU EVER BORROWED A BOOK

416
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,400
FROM THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY?

417
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:50,833
CROSSED THE COUNTRY WITHOUT

418
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,766
STOPPING FOR DIRECTIONS?

419
00:10:55,833 --> 00:11:00,533
OR SENT SOMEONE A FAX

420
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,066
FROM THE BEACH?

421
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:05,100
YOU WILL.

422
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,500
AND THE COMPANY THAT'LL BRING IT

423
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,466
AT&T.

424
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:10,000
WOW, THAT WAS

425
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:10,766
TWO-THIRDS OF THE WAY TO

426
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:11,833
SHOCKINGLY ACCURATE.

427
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,533
EBOOKS?

428
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,300
CHECK.

429
00:11:13,366 --> 00:11:14,066
GPS?

430
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:14,800
CHECK.

431
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:16,333
BEACH FAX?

432
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,700
NOT IN THIS OR ANY OTHER

433
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:18,900
LIFETIME.

434
00:11:18,966 --> 00:11:20,133
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, IF THERE

435
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,966
WAS ONE COMPANY THAT WOULD GO

436
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:22,833
ALL IN ON A DOOMED TECHNOLOGY

437
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,433
LIKE SAND-FAXING, IT WOULD BE

438
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,733
AT&T.

439
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,000
SPECIFICALLY, I WANT TO TALK

440
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:30,142
ABOUT ONE OF THE MORE DAMAGING

441
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,066
THINGS THE INTERNET HAS ENABLED,

442
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:32,413
AND THAT'S RANSOMWARE ATTACKS...

443
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:33,933
BASICALLY, INCIDENTS WHERE

444
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,120
HACKERS GET INTO A COMPUTER,

445
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,000
LOCK UP THE DATA, AND THEN FORCE

446
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:37,266
THE OWNERS TO PAY A RANSOM

447
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,266
IN ORDER TO UNLOCK IT.

448
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,509
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD A LOT ABOUT

449
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,733
THEM RECENTLY.

450
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,233
BACK IN MAY, A RANSOMWARE ATTACK

451
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,933
SHUT DOWN A TOP U.S. GAS

452
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,500
PIPELINE... THE COLONIAL

453
00:11:46,566 --> 00:11:48,433
PIPELINE, A MAJOR ARTERY FOR

454
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,100
FUEL ALONG THE EAST COAST.

455
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,466
AND WHILE THE COMPANY STRESSED

456
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:53,166
THERE WAS STILL PLENTY OF GAS

457
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:55,166
AVAILABLE, JUST THE VERY IDEA

458
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:56,633
THAT THERE MIGHT BE A SHORTAGE

459
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,333
LED TO CHAOS.

460
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,333
THE LINES FOR GAS GETTING

461
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,666
LONGER, FROM THE CAROLINAS,

462
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:03,400
DOWN TO FLORIDA,

463
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:04,800
PANICKED DRIVERS OVERWHELMING

464
00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:05,766
GAS STATIONS.

465
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,366
ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST,

466
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:09,666
DEMAND IS UP 40%.

467
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:11,066
PRICES AT THE PUMP INCHING UP

468
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:12,400
TOO.

469
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:13,400
I'LL SPEND THAT EXTRA

470
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,700
FEW BUCKS.

471
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:15,900
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.

472
00:12:15,966 --> 00:12:18,666
I JUST KINDA HEARD THERE WAS

473
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:19,633
GONNA BE A RUN ON GAS AND WE

474
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,366
FIGURED I BETTER GET IT NOW.

475
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:21,833
YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE!

476
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,166
"THERE WON'T BE A RUN ON GAS

477
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:24,600
UNLESS EVERYONE IS AN IDIOT,

478
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:25,966
WHICH MEANS THERE'S DEFINITELY

479
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:26,766
GOING TO BE A RUN ON GAS,

480
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:27,533
SO I MIGHT AS WELL BE A FASTER

481
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,966
IDIOT."

482
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:30,333
HE'S NOT WRONG, BUT IT'S PEOPLE

483
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,500
LIKE THAT GUY THAT MAKE

484
00:12:31,566 --> 00:12:32,709
EVERYTHING COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE

485
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:34,133
ALL OF THE TIME.

486
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,266
SO THANKS, "THAT GUY."

487
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,800
LIFE JUST WOULDN'T BE THE SAME

488
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:41,133
WITHOUT YOU, AND I REALLY WISH

489
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,433
LIFE WEREN'T ALWAYS THE SAME.

490
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,366
THE SCALE OF THE COLONIAL HACK

491
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:44,666
WAS TRULY REMARKABLE.

492
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:45,773
AND THEN IN JULY, THE I.T.

493
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,942
SOFTWARE COMPANY KASEYA GOT HIT

494
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,700
WITH AN EVEN BIGGER HACK.

495
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:50,233
AND SINCE ITS JOB WAS TO PUSH

496
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,500
SOFTWARE TO OTHER COMPANIES,

497
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:53,433
THAT MEANT THAT HUNDREDS OF

498
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,433
KASEYA'S CLIENTS, AND CLIENTS'

499
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,900
CLIENTS, LIKE A GROCERY STORE

500
00:12:55,966 --> 00:12:58,200
CHAIN, A PUBLIC BROADCASTER,

501
00:12:58,266 --> 00:12:59,166
SCHOOLS, AND A NATIONAL RAILWAY

502
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:01,766
SYSTEM WERE ALSO COMPROMISED.

503
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:02,876
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "IS IT

504
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,400
JUST ME, OR DID THERE NOT USED

505
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:07,600
TO BE A MASSIVE RANSOMWARE

506
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:08,700
ATTACK EVERY TWO MONTHS?"

507
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:09,966
YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT.

508
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:12,100
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, IT'S

509
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,406
GONE FROM A TRICKLE TO A FLOOD.

510
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:14,966
THE ESTIMATED TOTAL RANSOMS PAID

511
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:16,233
QUADRUPLED TO $350 MILLION

512
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,366
LAST YEAR.

513
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:21,733
AND THAT IS DEFINITELY AN

514
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,876
UNDERCOUNT, BECAUSE COMPANIES

515
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,433
OFTEN DON'T PUBLICLY DISCLOSE

516
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,833
RANSOMWARE ATTACKS, FOR FEAR OF

517
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,466
NEGATIVE PRESS OR LAWSUITS.

518
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:32,133
AND IT'S NOT JUST COMPANIES

519
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,800
INVOLVED HERE.

520
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:33,866
EVERYONE IS VULNERABLE TO

521
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:34,766
RANSOMWARE, EVEN THIS WOMAN.

522
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:35,873
INNA SIMONE IS RETIRED.

523
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,076
SHE'S A MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER

524
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,966
FROM RUSSIA WHO NOW LIVES

525
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:39,033
OUTSIDE OF BOSTON.

526
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,966
IN THE FALL OF 2014, HER HOME

527
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:41,766
COMPUTER STARTED ACTING

528
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,666
STRANGELY.

529
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:44,733
INNA SAW DOZENS OF THESE

530
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,266
MESSAGES.

531
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,466
THEY WERE ALL THE SAME.

532
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:47,542
THEY READ, "YOUR FILES ARE

533
00:13:47,566 --> 00:13:48,433
ENCRYPTED.

534
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,000
TO GET THE KEY TO DECRYPT THEM,

535
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:51,466
YOU HAVE TO PAY $500."

536
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:53,733
ALL HER FILES WERE LOCKED,

537
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,333
TAX RETURNS, FINANCIAL PAPERS,

538
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,700
LETTERS, EVEN THE PRECIOUS

539
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:58,833
PHOTOS OF HER GRANDDAUGHTER.

540
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,976
TUESDAY AFTERNOON, THE FULL

541
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,176
RANSOM WAS SENT TO THE HACKERS'

542
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,900
ACCOUNT.

543
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,933
INNA INSERTED ONE SHORT

544
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,633
MESSAGE TO THE CRIMINALS WITH

545
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,900
HER PAYMENT.

546
00:14:06,966 --> 00:14:08,866
I WROTE, "I WISH YOU ALL WILL

547
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:10,966
DROP DEAD."

548
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:12,566
YEAH.

549
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:13,900
YOU ALMOST FORGOT THAT WOMAN

550
00:14:13,966 --> 00:14:14,566
WAS GOING TO BE RUSSIAN

551
00:14:14,633 --> 00:14:16,566
FOR A MOMENT, DIDN'T YOU?

552
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:17,933
AND THEN SHE'S REALLY RUSSIAN.

553
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,566
SHE IS ENJOYING HERSELF.

554
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:21,033
YOU CAN TELL THIS ISN'T THE

555
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,633
FIRST TIME SHE'S WISHED DEATH

556
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,500
ON SOMEONE, AND ALSO, THAT THIS

557
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:24,833
WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME HER

558
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,933
WISH CAME TRUE.

559
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,700
SO IF IT'S SO PERVASIVE,

560
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:30,333
IT'S AFFECTING PIPELINES AND

561
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,466
GRANDMOTHERS, WE THOUGHT

562
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:34,400
TONIGHT, WE'D TAKE A LOOK AT

563
00:14:34,466 --> 00:14:34,966
RANSOMWARE, WHY IT'S ON THE

564
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:36,042
RISE, AND WHAT, IF ANYTHING,

565
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:36,766
CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT.

566
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:37,533
AND LET'S START WITH SOME

567
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,400
HISTORY.

568
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:41,100
THE FIRST RANSOMWARE ATTACK

569
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,376
ACTUALLY OCCURRED BACK IN 1989,

570
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,333
WHEN A MAN NAMED JOSEPH POPP

571
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,833
MAILED 20,000 FLOPPY DISKS TO

572
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,400
PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCHERS

573
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:48,642
THAT HE CLAIMED CONTAINED AIDS

574
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:49,200
RESEARCH.

575
00:14:49,266 --> 00:14:50,733
BUT WHEN THEY INSERTED THE DISK,

576
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,233
THEIR COMPUTERS WERE INFECTED

577
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:53,866
WITH MALWARE, THEIR FILES WERE

578
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:55,733
LOCKED UP, AND THE PROGRAM

579
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,000
DEMANDED THEY MAIL $189

580
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:58,733
TO A P.O. BOX IN PANAMA.

581
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,100
THIS IS A

582
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,833
CYBERCRIME SO OLD, IT USED TO

583
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,400
REQUIRE A BUNCH OF FLOPPY DISKS

584
00:15:03,466 --> 00:15:06,200
AND TWO PHYSICAL MAILMEN.

585
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:08,000
OH, AND FUN FACT: AFTER BEING

586
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:09,306
ARRESTED, POPP CLAIMED IN COURT

587
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,966
THAT HE HAD PLANNED TO DONATE

588
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:12,933
THAT RANSOM MONEY TO AIDS

589
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,366
RESEARCH, WHICH IS WEIRD BECAUSE

590
00:15:14,433 --> 00:15:15,200
HE HAD STOLEN THAT MONEY

591
00:15:15,266 --> 00:15:16,100
FROM AIDS RESEARCHERS

592
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,133
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

593
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,133
HE'S LIKE ROBIN HOOD,

594
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,900
IF ROBIN HOOD HAD GONE AROUND

595
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:22,233
TAKING MONEY FROM THE POOR AND

596
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,309
PROMISING THE POOR HE'D GIVE IT

597
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,566
BACK LATER.

598
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,433
BUT OBVIOUSLY, RANSOMWARE

599
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,509
DOESN'T COME IN VIA FLOPPY DISK

600
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:29,533
ANY MORE.

601
00:15:29,566 --> 00:15:31,100
INSTEAD, IT GETS INTO YOUR

602
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,300
SYSTEM THROUGH THE INTERNET,

603
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:33,733
WITH A MESSAGE LIKE THIS.

604
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,500
THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE

605
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,366
WHEN YOU GET ATTACKED.

606
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:38,700
IT SAYS, YOUR NETWORK HAS BEEN

607
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:39,876
INFECTED, RIGHT THERE IN BIG RED

608
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,966
TYPE.

609
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:41,633
YOUR DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN

610
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,800
ENCRYPTED.

611
00:15:42,866 --> 00:15:47,000
AND NOW TO GET THEM BACK,

612
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:47,633
YOU HAVE TO PAY, IS WHAT THIS

613
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,200
RANSOM NOTE IS TELLING YOU.

614
00:15:48,266 --> 00:15:49,433
THERE'S A COUNTDOWN CLOCK

615
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,709
THERE LETTING YOU KNOW YOU HAVE

616
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:51,633
JUST LIMITED TIME HERE TO TAKE

617
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,600
ACTION AND PAY THESE HACKERS OR

618
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:55,809
ELSE THE PRICE IS GOING TO GO UP

619
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:56,433
AND YOU MIGHT NOT GET YOUR DATA

620
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,366
BACK.

621
00:15:58,433 --> 00:15:59,500
YEAH, THAT'S NOT A

622
00:15:59,566 --> 00:16:00,066
MESSAGE YOU WANT TO SEE

623
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:01,400
ON YOUR SCREEN.

624
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:03,066
AND WHILE THEY'RE SCARY ENOUGH

625
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:04,033
IN THAT FORM, SOME ATTACKS CAN

626
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,766
BE CARTOONISHLY TERRIFYING.

627
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:06,700
HERE'S ONE FEATURING

628
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:07,900
THE ANNABELLE DOLL.

629
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:10,500
HERE'S ONE WITH THE PUPPET

630
00:16:10,566 --> 00:16:13,100
FROM "SAW."

631
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,000
NOBODY WANTS TO SEE THAT!

632
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:14,666
AND HERE'S ONE WITH

633
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:15,876
THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE SCREAMING

634
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,866
"FUCK YOU" AND SAYING THE ONLY

635
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:18,733
WAY TO UNLOCK YOUR COMPUTER IS

636
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,400
TO SEND HIM AT LEAST TEN NUDES,

637
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:22,333
WHICH I'M PRETTY SURE IS A

638
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,509
REFERENCE TO THE UNAIRED FINAL

639
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:24,333
EPISODE OF "THOMAS AND FRIENDS"

640
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,700
WHERE THEY INTRODUCED THOMAS TO

641
00:16:25,766 --> 00:16:27,666
THE CONCEPT OF PORNOGRAPHY, AND

642
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:29,366
HE BECAME SO CRAZED BY IT, HE

643
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:30,709
HAD TO BE FORCIBLY DISASSEMBLED.

644
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:32,266
THEY SAY IF YOU WANDER THE SODOR

645
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,409
SCRAPYARDS AT NIGHT, YOU CAN

646
00:16:33,433 --> 00:16:35,300
HEAR THE WAILING OF A THOUSAND

647
00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:36,866
SCATTERED PISTONS, STILL ALIVE

648
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:39,033
AND HOWLING FOR DICK PICS.

649
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,933
SO THAT'S WHAT RANSOMWARE LOOKS

650
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,100
LIKE.

651
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,000
BUT HOW MUCH HARM CAN IT DO?

652
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:44,000
WELL, DEPENDING ON THE TARGET,

653
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:45,800
A LOT.

654
00:16:45,866 --> 00:16:47,600
RANSOMWARE HAS CAUSED CHAOS IN

655
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:48,433
CITY GOVERNMENTS LIKE BALTIMORE

656
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,733
AND NEW ORLEANS.

657
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,033
AND HACKERS HAVE ALSO HIT SCHOOL

658
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,000
DISTRICTS, POLICE DEPARTMENTS,

659
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:55,166
AND EVEN HOSPITAL SYSTEMS.

660
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:56,800
LAST MONTH, A CYBERATTACK

661
00:16:56,866 --> 00:16:58,833
TARGETING THE HOSPITAL CHAIN

662
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,233
UNIVERSAL HEALTH SERVICES CAUSED

663
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,633
A MAJOR COMPUTER FAILURE, WITH

664
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,333
SOME OF ITS HOSPITALS FORCED TO

665
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,666
USE PEN AND PAPER TO FILE

666
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,200
PATIENT INFORMATION.

667
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:08,933
SO THIS IS A PERFECT STORM

668
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,833
HITTING THE HOSPITALS, AND

669
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,633
THERE'S ACTUALLY NEVER BEEN

670
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,966
A BETTER TIME, IF YOU'RE A

671
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:14,900
RANSOMWARE SYNDICATE AND YOU

672
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:15,976
WANT A FAST PAYOUT, THIS WOULD

673
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,166
BE THE TIME TO STRIKE.

674
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:19,233
HEY, THERESA,

675
00:17:19,266 --> 00:17:21,033
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

676
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:21,900
LOOK, I'M NO STRANGER TO

677
00:17:21,966 --> 00:17:23,300
INADVERTENTLY GIVING

678
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:24,833
UNSCRUPULOUS PEOPLE NEW WAYS

679
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,166
TO PREY ON THE VULNERABLE.

680
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:27,500
THIS SEASON ALONE, WE'VE DONE

681
00:17:27,566 --> 00:17:28,900
STORIES ON PREDATORY NURSING

682
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:30,200
HOMES, PACE LOAN SCAMS, AND

683
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:31,066
BASICALLY TOLD YOU HOW TO SET UP

684
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,266
A FAKE RELIGIOUS HEALTH

685
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,966
INSURANCE COMPANY.

686
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:34,966
THIS SHOW COULD EASILY BE CALLED

687
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:36,200
"GETTING RICH FOR SOCIOPATHS"

688
00:17:36,266 --> 00:17:38,100
WITH JOHN OLIVER.

689
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,433
BUT I WILL SAY, AT LEAST I'VE

690
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,642
NEVER LOOK DEAD INTO CAMERA AND

691
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,233
TOLD HACKERS IT'S A GREAT TIME

692
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,066
TO TAKE DOWN A HOSPITAL.

693
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:45,433
UNTIL, I GUESS, JUST NOW.

694
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,509
WHAT HAVE YOU GOTTEN ME INTO,

695
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,500
THERESA?

696
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:50,900
AND TO BE FAIR, HACKERS DON'T

697
00:17:50,966 --> 00:17:52,433
NEED MUCH ENCOURAGEMENT.

698
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,833
LAST YEAR, OVER 500 HEALTHCARE

699
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,733
FACILITIES WERE HIT BY

700
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,733
RANSOMWARE ATTACKS

701
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,466
IN THE U.S. ALONE.

702
00:17:58,533 --> 00:18:00,000
ONE OF WHICH WAS IN VERMONT,

703
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:01,176
WHERE CLINICIANS WERE FORCED TO

704
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,033
TURN AWAY HUNDREDS OF CANCER

705
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,533
PATIENTS WHO NEEDED TREATMENT

706
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
AFTER THEY LOST ACCESS TO

707
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,300
MEDICAL RECORDS.

708
00:18:06,366 --> 00:18:09,233
AND THE THING IS, HACKERS DON'T

709
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:09,800
NECESSARILY HAVE TO WORK TOO

710
00:18:09,866 --> 00:18:11,300
HARD TO DO THIS.

711
00:18:11,366 --> 00:18:12,600
ABOUT 85% OF HOSPITALS DON'T

712
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,166
HAVE A SINGLE QUALIFIED

713
00:18:14,233 --> 00:18:18,900
CYBERSECURITY PERSON ON STAFF,

714
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:19,766
WHICH DOES FEEL LIKE IT'S JUST

715
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:20,400
ASKING FOR TROUBLE.

716
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:21,600
IN FACT, LAX SECURITY IS A

717
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,600
PROBLEM ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES.

718
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,800
THE COLONIAL PIPELINE ATTACK

719
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:27,300
OCCURRED BECAUSE AN EMPLOYEE HAD

720
00:18:27,366 --> 00:18:29,333
USED THE SAME PASSWORD ACROSS

721
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,933
MULTIPLE SERVICES, AND THE

722
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,300
COMPANY DIDN'T USE MULTI-FACTOR

723
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:34,500
AUTHENTICATION.

724
00:18:34,566 --> 00:18:35,933
SO WHEN THAT PASSWORD WAS

725
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,076
BREACHED IN AN ATTACK ELSEWHERE,

726
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,633
THERE WAS A DIRECT WAY IN.

727
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,966
AND WHEN PRESSED ON WHAT

728
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:43,033
HAPPENED, COLONIAL'S CEO WASN'T

729
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,733
PARTICULARLY REASSURING.

730
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,866
IN THE CASE OF THIS

731
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:50,433
PARTICULAR LEGACY VPN, IT DID

732
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:52,266
ONLY HAVE SINGLE-FACTOR

733
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,533
AUTHENTICATION, IT WAS A

734
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,533
COMPLICATED PASSWORD, SO I WANT

735
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,966
TO BE CLEAR ON THAT, IT WAS NOT

736
00:19:00,033 --> 00:19:00,600
A "COLONIAL 123" -TYPE PASSWORD.

737
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:01,166
WELL, HOLD ON.

738
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:02,366
NO ONE SAID IT WAS!

739
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,576
I DON'T KNOW WHOSE EXPECTATIONS

740
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,066
YOU THINK YOU'RE MEETING WITH

741
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:06,200
THAT ANSWER.

742
00:19:06,266 --> 00:19:07,309
THE ONLY PEOPLE I'D EVEN SUSPECT

743
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,633
OF USING "COLONIAL123" AS A

744
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,766
PASSWORD ARE THE STAFF AT

745
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:10,933
COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG, AND

746
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,600
THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE AGGRESSIVELY

747
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,000
SUCKING AT CYBERSECURITY WOULD

748
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:15,100
AT LEAST BE HISTORICALLY

749
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,533
ACCURATE.

750
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,400
AND HERE'S THE THING,

751
00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:20,333
EVEN ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE

752
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,433
SCRUPULOUS ABOUT BACKING UP DATA

753
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,033
SO IT CAN BE EASILY RECOVERED

754
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,533
CAN STILL BE VULNERABLE.

755
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,876
BECAUSE HACKERS ARE NOW NOT JUST

756
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,333
ENCRYPTING DATA, THEY'RE ALSO

757
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,640
THREATENING TO RELEASE FILES OR

758
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,100
PERSONAL INFORMATION PUBLICLY.

759
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,666
THIS HAPPENED TO THE D.C. POLICE

760
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:37,000
RECENTLY WHEN HACKERS RELEASED

761
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:38,209
THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF 22

762
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:38,966
OFFICERS.

763
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:41,033
AND A FEW YEARS AGO, HBO WAS

764
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:41,900
HIT, TOO, WITH HACKERS DEMANDING

765
00:19:41,966 --> 00:19:42,533
AROUND $6 MILLION OR THEY'D LEAK

766
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,666
UNAIRED EPISODES OF

767
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:45,233
"GAME OF THRONES."

768
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,409
WHICH, TO BE HONEST, IS A PRETTY

769
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:47,066
WEAK THREAT.

770
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:48,176
IF HBO'S GOING TO BE PUBLICLY

771
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,633
HUMILIATED, IT WILL BE BY

772
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,266
RELEASING THE LAST SEASON OF

773
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,133
"GAME OF THRONES" ON ITS OWN

774
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,366
TERMS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

775
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:57,533
AND IF HAVING YOUR DATA LOCKED

776
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,866
OR LEAKED WEREN'T SCARY ENOUGH,

777
00:19:58,933 --> 00:19:59,633
IT ACTUALLY GETS WORSE.

778
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,866
BECAUSE WE'RE INCREASINGLY

779
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:03,009
HOOKING PHYSICAL OBJECTS IN OUR

780
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:04,333
LIVES UP TO THE INTERNET...

781
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,476
THINGS LIKE TVs, REFRIGERATORS,

782
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,666
AND OVENS.

783
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:09,333
AND THEY CAN BE VULNERABLE TO

784
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:09,833
RANSOMWARE, TOO.

785
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,900
BACK IN 2016, HACKERS MADE

786
00:20:11,966 --> 00:20:13,166
THE FIRST-EVER RANSOMWARE FOR

787
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:14,366
SMART THERMOSTATS, CRANKING

788
00:20:14,433 --> 00:20:15,593
THE TEMPERATURE TO 99 DEGREES

789
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:18,866
UNLESS THE OWNER PAID UP.

790
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:20,533
AND LAST YEAR, RESEARCHERS FOUND

791
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,700
A VULNERABILITY IN AN

792
00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:24,066
INTERNET-ENABLED CHASTITY CAGE

793
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:26,066
BASICALLY A HIGH-TECH PENIS

794
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:26,700
PRISON... THAT COULD BE

795
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:27,966
COCK-LOCKED UNTIL THE PERSON

796
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:29,033
IN JUNK JAIL PAID UP.

797
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:30,800
AND INTERESTINGLY, THE

798
00:20:30,866 --> 00:20:33,000
RESEARCHERS WHO DISCOVERED THAT

799
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,309
FELT COMPELLED TO GO PUBLIC WITH

800
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,566
IT BECAUSE OF THE NEXT PRODUCT

801
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:36,300
THAT COMPANY WAS ABOUT TO

802
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:37,400
RELEASE.

803
00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:39,000
HI THERE!

804
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:40,166
WE'RE INTRODUCING YOU TO

805
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:42,500
PEAR FLOWER ANAL PLUG.

806
00:20:42,566 --> 00:20:43,742
COMPATIBLE TO VARIOUS TEALS AND

807
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:44,866
LEASH.

808
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:46,300
YOU NEED TO SELECT TO BE

809
00:20:46,366 --> 00:20:47,600
"KEYMASTER" OR "WEARER."

810
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,566
WEARER CAN ADD FRIENDS IN THE

811
00:20:48,633 --> 00:20:49,900
APP, AND INVITE FRIENDS TO BE

812
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:51,200
KEYMASTER.

813
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:53,100
THIS INVITED KEYMASTER HAS RIGHT

814
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,100
TO GIVE PERMISSION TO WEARER FOR

815
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,733
UNLOCKING.

816
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,400
WEARER CANNOT UNLOCK WITHOUT

817
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:59,733
PERMISSION FROM KEYMASTER.

818
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,466
YEAH, THAT PRODUCT

819
00:21:01,533 --> 00:21:02,466
COULD ESSENTIALLY GIVE THE

820
00:21:02,533 --> 00:21:04,133
INTERNET CONTROL OVER YOUR ANUS,

821
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,900
WHICH DOESN'T SEEM GREAT.

822
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:07,366
ASSHOLES ARE LIKE OPINIONS:

823
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,200
LETTING THE INTERNET BE IN

824
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:09,966
CHARGE OF YOURS IS A REALLY

825
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:12,133
BAD IDEA.

826
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,866
NOW, INCREDIBLY, I LEGALLY HAVE

827
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:15,833
TO TELL YOU AT THIS POINT:

828
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,466
THAT BUTT PLUG DOES COME WITH

829
00:21:17,533 --> 00:21:21,400
A PHYSICAL KEY FOR EMERGENCIES.

830
00:21:21,466 --> 00:21:24,233
WHICH I AM NOT SURE IS

831
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,933
COMPLETELY REASSURING.

832
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,500
KEYS DO GET LOST, DON'T THEY?

833
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:28,700
JUST PICTURE THE LAST TIME

834
00:21:28,766 --> 00:21:30,533
YOU SEARCHED FOR YOUR KEYS

835
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,333
AROUND YOUR HOUSE AND

836
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
NOW RAISE THE STAKES

837
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:33,366
SIGNIFICANTLY.

838
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:34,700
THE POINT IS, THE COSTS OF

839
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:35,776
RANSOMWARE KEEP GETTING HIGHER

840
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,809
AND HIGHER, EVEN AS, CRUCIALLY,

841
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,733
THE BARRIER TO ENTRY HAS GOTTEN

842
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,833
MUCH LOWER.

843
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,433
BECAUSE THE EXPLOSION IN

844
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,033
RANSOMWARE HAS BASICALLY BEEN

845
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,100
THE RESULT OF THREE MAJOR

846
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:44,700
DEVELOPMENTS.

847
00:21:44,766 --> 00:21:45,466
THE FIRST ONE IS THE EMERGENCE

848
00:21:45,533 --> 00:21:46,266
OF SOMETHING CALLED

849
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,300
"RANSOMWARE AS A SERVICE."

850
00:21:49,366 --> 00:21:51,166
BASICALLY, HACKERS WILL DEVELOP

851
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:53,166
A RANSOMWARE PROGRAM, AND THEN

852
00:21:53,233 --> 00:21:54,342
SELL IT TO ANYONE WHO MIGHT WANT

853
00:21:54,366 --> 00:21:55,100
TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK AND SPLIT

854
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,033
THE PROFITS.

855
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,533
WHAT THIS MEANS IS, BASICALLY

856
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,733
ANYONE CAN LAUNCH AN ATTACK,

857
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,200
EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT PARTICULARLY

858
00:22:02,266 --> 00:22:04,733
TECH-SAVVY... IN FACT, JUST

859
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,100
WATCH AS A CYBERSECURITY EXPERT

860
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:06,633
WALKS THROUGH THE FEATURES

861
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,166
OFFERED BY ONE RANSOMWARE

862
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:09,066
VENDOR.

863
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:10,566
THEY ACTUALLY PROVIDE YOU

864
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:11,966
WITH BASICALLY A CHAT ROOM,

865
00:22:12,033 --> 00:22:13,766
WHERE YOU CAN ASK QUESTIONS TO

866
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,000
THE PEOPLE WHO MAINTAIN THIS

867
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:16,966
ARCHITECTURE FOR YOU.

868
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:18,142
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

869
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:18,900
FOR CRIMINALS.

870
00:22:18,966 --> 00:22:20,866
EXACTLY.

871
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:22,800
TOM PACE LOGGED ONTO THE SITE

872
00:22:22,866 --> 00:22:24,109
AND USED IT TO ENCRYPT A NETWORK

873
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:25,133
OF HIS OWN.

874
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,666
SO ALL OF THE FILES THAT ARE

875
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:28,666
ON THIS SYSTEM HAVE NOW BEEN

876
00:22:28,733 --> 00:22:30,866
SUCCESSFULLY ENCRYPTED.

877
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,766
SO THIS TOOK YOU JUST

878
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,833
SLIGHTLY OVER FIVE MINUTES,

879
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,166
AND YOU DIDN'T WRITE A SINGLE

880
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:37,833
LINE OF CODE?

881
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,333
CORRECT.

882
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,133
OFF THE SHELF.

883
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,366
OFF THE SHELF.

884
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:41,900
READY TO GO.

885
00:22:41,966 --> 00:22:44,033
THAT IS ALARMINGLY

886
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,000
EASY!

887
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:46,366
IDEALLY, NO ONE WOULD LAUNCH

888
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:47,600
RANSOMWARE ATTACKS.

889
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:48,600
BUT MY NEXT PREFERENCE WOULD BE

890
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:50,500
THAT LAUNCHING ONE SHOULD

891
00:22:50,566 --> 00:22:51,366
REQUIRE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE WORK

892
00:22:51,433 --> 00:22:52,900
THAN SIMPLY CLICKING

893
00:22:52,966 --> 00:22:54,533
"ADD RANSOMWARE TO CART."

894
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,866
IF IT'S BEGINNING TO SEEM LIKE

895
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:57,200
RANSOMWARE IS JUST A TYPICAL

896
00:22:57,266 --> 00:22:58,333
BUSINESS, BUT STAFFED BY

897
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,800
CRIMINALS, YOU'RE NOT ENTIRELY

898
00:22:59,866 --> 00:23:00,933
WRONG.

899
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,533
THIS CAN BE A VERY PROFESSIONAL

900
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,233
ENTERPRISE, WITH CUSTOMER CARE

901
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,509
FOR BOTH THE CRIMINAL WHO BOUGHT

902
00:23:06,533 --> 00:23:07,400
THE RANSOMWARE PRODUCT, AND THE

903
00:23:07,466 --> 00:23:09,066
VICTIM ON THE RECEIVING END OF

904
00:23:09,133 --> 00:23:10,166
IT.

905
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:11,966
ONE EXPERT EVEN SAID, "HONESTLY,

906
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:13,100
I WISH MY INTERNET SERVICE

907
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:14,600
PROVIDER HAD CUSTOMER SERVICE

908
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:15,600
THE WAY THESE GUYS DO."

909
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,200
WHICH SEEMS A LITTLE UNFAIR,

910
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:18,700
SINCE RANSOMWARE HACKERS ARE

911
00:23:18,766 --> 00:23:19,942
CRIMINALS AND INTERNET SERVICE

912
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,700
PROVIDERS ARE FUCKING MONSTERS.

913
00:23:21,766 --> 00:23:23,066
YOU CAN'T HOLD THEM TO THE SAME

914
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:25,300
STANDARDS.

915
00:23:25,366 --> 00:23:27,133
AND FOR A SENSE OF THE CUSTOMER

916
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,000
SERVICE THEY OFFER FOR VICTIMS,

917
00:23:28,066 --> 00:23:30,166
REMEMBER THAT GRANDMOTHER?

918
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:31,473
THE PEOPLE THAT HACKED HER WERE

919
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,740
HAPPY TO HELP GUIDE HER THROUGH

920
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,133
THE PROCESS OF PAYMENT.

921
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,433
IN THEIR RANSOM NOTE, THE

922
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,000
HACKERS WANTED TO BE PAID IN

923
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:40,466
BITCOIN, THE LARGELY UNTRACEABLE

924
00:23:40,533 --> 00:23:41,576
DIGITAL CURRENCY, AND HAVE IT

925
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,366
PUT INTO THEIR ANONYMOUS

926
00:23:42,433 --> 00:23:43,433
ACCOUNT.

927
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:45,033
INNA HAD NEVER HEARD OF BITCOIN,

928
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,200
BUT THE HACKERS, IN ONE OF THEIR

929
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:48,466
MANY TOUCHES OF WHAT YOU MIGHT

930
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,066
CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE, PROVIDED

931
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:51,600
ALL SORTS OF HELPFUL FACTS AND

932
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,833
LINKS AND HOW-TO GUIDES ABOUT

933
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:58,100
BITCOIN.

934
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:58,833
IT'S TRUE!

935
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,900
THEY HAD TO TEACH

936
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:04,266
INNA HOW TO USE BITCOIN.

937
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,500
THAT IS GENUINELY WAY MORE

938
00:24:05,566 --> 00:24:06,333
IMPRESSIVE THAN CARRYING OUT A

939
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,033
RANSOMWARE ATTACK.

940
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,833
CLICK

941
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,100
THINK ABOUT IT, IF YOU HAD TO

942
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:14,000
TEACH YOUR GRANDMA TO USE

943
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:15,109
CRYPTOCURRENCY IN ORDER TO MAKE

944
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:16,566
$500, ARE YOU CONFIDENT YOU

945
00:24:16,633 --> 00:24:17,500
WOULD WALK OUT OF THERE WITH

946
00:24:17,566 --> 00:24:18,133
$500?

947
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,033
LET'S SAY YOU HAD INFINITE TIME

948
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,266
AND INFINITE GRANDMAS.

949
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,442
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND BITCOIN,

950
00:24:21,466 --> 00:24:21,966
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO TEACH A

951
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:23,109
GRANDMA, ANY GRANDMA, TO USE IT.

952
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:24,066
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY GETTING $500

953
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:26,633
OUT OF THAT SITUATION?

954
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,500
DEEP DOWN, I THINK YOU KNOW THE

955
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:28,866
ANSWER TO THAT.

956
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:29,976
BUT THE BITCOIN PART OF THAT

957
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,100
STORY ACTUALLY BRINGS US TO

958
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:33,266
THE SECOND MAJOR DRIVER OF

959
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,342
RANSOMWARE, AND THAT'S THE RISE

960
00:24:34,366 --> 00:24:36,266
OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES.

961
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,700
THEY'VE MADE IT MUCH EASIER TO

962
00:24:37,766 --> 00:24:39,400
MAKE MONEY FROM RANSOMWARE,

963
00:24:39,466 --> 00:24:40,706
AND MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR LAW

964
00:24:40,733 --> 00:24:41,976
ENFORCEMENT TO RECOVER PAYMENTS.

965
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,333
BECAUSE IF RANSOMS WERE PAID IN

966
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,566
WIRE TRANSFERS, COMPANIES COULD

967
00:24:45,633 --> 00:24:46,166
FIND A WAY TO CLAW THAT MONEY

968
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:46,900
BACK.

969
00:24:46,966 --> 00:24:48,266
BUT WITH CRYPTOCURRENCIES,

970
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,200
IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDO.

971
00:24:50,266 --> 00:24:52,566
AND WHILE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

972
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:53,166
ACTUALLY DID MANAGE TO RECOVER

973
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:54,500
SOME OF THE BITCOIN USED

974
00:24:54,566 --> 00:24:56,100
IN THE COLONIAL PIPELINE RANSOM,

975
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,446
THERE ARE OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES

976
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,233
DESIGNED TO BE EVEN MORE

977
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,800
ANONYMOUS.

978
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:02,133
TAKE MONERO, WHICH IN ITS ADS,

979
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,276
SEEMS TO BE AWARE OF JUST HOW

980
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,200
ATTRACTIVE IT IS TO CRIMINALS.

981
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:07,200
THERE'S NO SAFE PLACE TO

982
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:09,366
CONDUCT PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS.

983
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:10,533
WELL, THERE WASN'T ONE,

984
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,866
UNTIL NOW.

985
00:25:11,933 --> 00:25:13,733
MEET MONERO.

986
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,876
MONERO IS A SECURE, PRIVATE,

987
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,600
UNTRACEABLE CURRENCY.

988
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:18,866
WITH MONERO, YOU ARE YOUR OWN

989
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:20,200
BANK.

990
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:22,700
ONLY YOU CONTROL AND ARE

991
00:25:22,766 --> 00:25:24,600
RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR FUNDS.

992
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:26,000
MONERO IS PRIVATE.

993
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,533
THIS MEANS BUSINESSES CAN

994
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,866
KEEP THEIR SUPPLIERS IN SECRET,

995
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:33,100
AS WELL AS CITIZENS ESCAPE

996
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:34,342
GOVERNMENT REPRESSIONS, AND NOSY

997
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,500
NEIGHBORS OR CROOKS.

998
00:25:35,566 --> 00:25:37,300
OH, COME ON.

999
00:25:37,366 --> 00:25:38,700
THERE'S A PRETTY CLEAR SUBTEXT

1000
00:25:38,766 --> 00:25:40,033
TO WHAT THEY'RE SELLING THERE.

1001
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,033
IT'S LIKE SEEING A CHEERFUL AD

1002
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,033
FOR "PLASTIC TUBS THE SIZE AND

1003
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,500
SHAPE OF A HUMAN BODY."

1004
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:45,133
THIS ISN'T FOR ANYTHING IN

1005
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,200
PARTICULAR!

1006
00:25:46,266 --> 00:25:48,166
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF HUMAN

1007
00:25:48,233 --> 00:25:50,133
BODY-SIZED THINGS YOU COULD PUT

1008
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,833
INTO ONE OF THESE STURDY TUBS!

1009
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,266
ALSO, THEY'RE SCREAM PROOF!

1010
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:53,400
"NO MATTER HOW MUCH SOUND

1011
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:54,333
SOMETHING MAKES INSIDE,

1012
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,666
YOU'LL NEVER HEAR IT!"

1013
00:25:55,733 --> 00:25:56,776
WE'RE NOT TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO

1014
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,300
WITH OUR PRODUCT, THOUGH...

1015
00:25:58,366 --> 00:25:58,900
WE'RE SIMPLY LEADING YOU TO A

1016
00:25:58,966 --> 00:26:01,200
VERY SPECIFIC CONCLUSION.

1017
00:26:01,266 --> 00:26:02,966
ALTHOUGH, INTERESTINGLY, DESPITE

1018
00:26:03,033 --> 00:26:05,300
THE FACT HACKERS NOW HAVE THE

1019
00:26:05,366 --> 00:26:06,200
ABILITY TO MAKE THEIR FINANCIAL

1020
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:07,700
TRANSACTIONS IN SECRET, IT'S NOT

1021
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:08,842
ALWAYS THAT HARD TO FIGURE OUT

1022
00:26:08,866 --> 00:26:11,766
WHERE, EXACTLY, THE MONEY IS

1023
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:11,966
GOING.

1024
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:14,366
THIS SHOWS AN ALLEGED MEMBER

1025
00:26:14,433 --> 00:26:15,800
OF A RUSSIAN CYBER GANG KNOWN AS

1026
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:17,900
EVIL CORP, SHOWING OFF AN

1027
00:26:17,966 --> 00:26:18,633
EXPENSIVE LAMBORGHINI IN A

1028
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,400
PARKING GARAGE.

1029
00:26:22,466 --> 00:26:24,200
THIS IS VIDEO OF EVIL CORP

1030
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:26,200
MEMBERS ALLEGEDLY DOING DONUTS

1031
00:26:26,266 --> 00:26:27,100
AND OBSTRUCTING TRAFFIC IN

1032
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:28,700
DOWNTOWN MOSCOW.

1033
00:26:28,766 --> 00:26:30,333
VIDEOS AND PHOTOGRAPHS

1034
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,933
RELEASED BY INVESTIGATORS SHOW

1035
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,666
THE ALLEGED HACKERS LIVING

1036
00:26:33,733 --> 00:26:36,366
LARGE, POSING WITH ARMS FULL OF

1037
00:26:36,433 --> 00:26:37,166
CASH, AND SHOWING OFF A PET LION

1038
00:26:37,233 --> 00:26:38,966
CUB.

1039
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:40,700
THIS IS 32-YEAR-OLD

1040
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,000
MAKSIM YAKUBETS WITH HIS

1041
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:43,933
LAMBORGHINI HURACAN AND HIS

1042
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,900
PERSONALIZED NUMBER PLATES,

1043
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:46,833
WHICH IN RUSSIAN READS "THIEF."

1044
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,566
WOW.

1045
00:26:48,633 --> 00:26:50,566
THESE GUYS ARE DOUCHES.

1046
00:26:50,633 --> 00:26:51,866
IT'S BAD ENOUGH SITTING

1047
00:26:51,933 --> 00:26:53,633
IN A TRAFFIC JAM WATCHING SOME

1048
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,033
ASSHOLE DO DONUTS IN THE MIDDLE

1049
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,209
OF THE STREET WITHOUT HAVING TO

1050
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:58,133
WONDER IF THERE'S A LION CUB

1051
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,633
THROWING UP IN THE CAR.

1052
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,166
C'MON, GUYS.

1053
00:26:59,233 --> 00:27:01,100
LEAVE LIONS OUT OF THIS.

1054
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:02,400
IF YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HAVE

1055
00:27:02,466 --> 00:27:04,400
A WEIRD ANIMAL, GET A BIG SNAKE.

1056
00:27:04,466 --> 00:27:06,266
I COULD GIVE TWO SHITS ABOUT

1057
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,376
A BIG SNAKE'S QUALITY OF LIFE.

1058
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,033
AND YOU CAN TELL ANY BIG SNAKE

1059
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,533
I SAID THAT.

1060
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,500
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY A REASON

1061
00:27:11,566 --> 00:27:12,933
THOSE HACKERS FEEL SO

1062
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,633
COMFORTABLE DRIVING AROUND WITH

1063
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,800
LICENSE PLATES THAT ARE

1064
00:27:15,866 --> 00:27:16,976
BASICALLY AN ADMISSION OF GUILT,

1065
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,100
AND THAT'S BRINGS US TO

1066
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,209
THE FINAL FACTOR INCREASING

1067
00:27:19,233 --> 00:27:20,700
RANSOMWARE ATTACKS, AND THAT'S

1068
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:22,966
COUNTRIES PROVIDING SAFE HAVENS.

1069
00:27:23,033 --> 00:27:24,333
BECAUSE MULTIPLE GOVERNMENTS...

1070
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,066
AND RUSSIA, IN PARTICULAR...

1071
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:29,966
WILL LOOK THE OTHER WAY FOR

1072
00:27:30,033 --> 00:27:30,366
HACKERS

1073
00:27:30,433 --> 00:27:31,200
SO LONG AS THEY DO

1074
00:27:31,266 --> 00:27:32,800
THEIR WORK OUTSIDE OF THEIR

1075
00:27:32,866 --> 00:27:33,133
BORDERS.

1076
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,233
CYBERSECURITY EXPERTS SAY THE

1077
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,200
"DON'T WORK IN .RU" STRICTURE

1078
00:27:37,266 --> 00:27:37,966
HAS BECOME AN UNWRITTEN RULE

1079
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:39,400
IN THE RUSSIAN-SPEAKING HACKING

1080
00:27:39,466 --> 00:27:40,733
COMMUNITY, TO AVOID

1081
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,466
ENTANGLEMENTS WITH RUSSIAN

1082
00:27:41,533 --> 00:27:42,633
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

1083
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,842
BASICALLY, RUSSIAN HACKERS KNOW,

1084
00:27:43,866 --> 00:27:45,166
AS LONG AS THEY DON'T MAKE

1085
00:27:45,233 --> 00:27:45,966
TROUBLE AT HOME, THEY WON'T BE

1086
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:47,033
PUNISHED FOR WHAT THEY DO

1087
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,466
ABROAD.

1088
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:51,333
AND WHEN YOU PUT ALL OF THIS

1089
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,633
TOGETHER, WITH CYBERCRIMINALS

1090
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,533
ABLE TO BUY RANSOMWARE OFF THE

1091
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,966
SHELF, GET PAID IN UNTRACEABLE

1092
00:27:56,033 --> 00:27:57,333
CURRENCY, AND WORK FREE FROM

1093
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,133
STATE INTERFERENCE, IS IT ANY

1094
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,566
WONDER WE HAVE SUCH A MASSIVE

1095
00:27:59,633 --> 00:28:01,733
PROBLEM ON OUR HANDS?

1096
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,866
WHICH BRINGS US TO THE KEY

1097
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:04,976
QUESTION... WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT

1098
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,600
THIS?

1099
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:08,566
WELL, HERE'S A TERRIBLE IDEA.

1100
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:10,533
WE OUGHT TO PASS A LAW

1101
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,466
IMMEDIATELY THAT MAKES IT...

1102
00:28:12,533 --> 00:28:15,066
THIS KIND OF HACKING SUBJECT TO

1103
00:28:15,133 --> 00:28:17,300
A DEATH PENALTY, AND THE LAW

1104
00:28:17,366 --> 00:28:18,509
SHOULD INCLUDE A PROVISION THAT

1105
00:28:18,533 --> 00:28:21,466
THE PRESIDENT, THROUGH A

1106
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,166
JUDICIAL PROCESS, SHOULD BE ABLE

1107
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:24,500
TO ORDER THE KILLING OF ANYBODY

1108
00:28:24,566 --> 00:28:25,766
OVERSEAS WHO IS DOING THIS.

1109
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:27,366
WOW.

1110
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:30,000
THAT'S BOTH INCREDIBLY HARSH AND

1111
00:28:30,066 --> 00:28:31,700
ALSO ENDEARINGLY NAIVE.

1112
00:28:31,766 --> 00:28:33,333
BECAUSE I HATE TO BREAK IT TO

1113
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,500
NEWT, BUT AMERICA DOESN'T

1114
00:28:34,566 --> 00:28:35,833
EXACTLY CONCERN ITSELF WITH

1115
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,300
"A JUDICIAL PROCESS" TO KILL

1116
00:28:37,366 --> 00:28:38,300
PEOPLE OVERSEAS.

1117
00:28:38,366 --> 00:28:39,566
WE VERY MUCH TAKE

1118
00:28:39,633 --> 00:28:41,433
THE SANTA CLAUS APPROACH:

1119
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,100
SEE THEM WHEN THEY'RE SLEEPING,

1120
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:44,100
KNOW WHEN THEY'RE AWAKE, MAKE A

1121
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:45,376
LIST OF WHO'S BEEN BAD OR GOOD,

1122
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,033
AND THEN KILL SOME BAD ONES,

1123
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:46,800
AND WHICHEVER GOOD ONES HAPPEN

1124
00:28:46,866 --> 00:28:47,800
TO BE AROUND THEM.

1125
00:28:47,866 --> 00:28:52,866
YOU KNOW, FOR GOODNESS' SAKE.

1126
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:53,766
SO THAT IS ONE EXTREME WAY TO

1127
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:54,500
HANDLE THIS.

1128
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,433
THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION,

1129
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,766
HOWEVER, HAS SO FAR TAKEN A

1130
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:57,166
DIFFERENT TACK.

1131
00:28:57,233 --> 00:28:58,166
IN THE WAKE OF THE COLONIAL

1132
00:28:58,233 --> 00:28:59,100
HACK, THIS WAS THE MESSAGE THEY

1133
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:00,500
WERE PUBLICLY SENDING.

1134
00:29:00,566 --> 00:29:02,333
WE RECOGNIZE THAT VICTIMS OF

1135
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,600
CYBERATTACKS OFTEN FACE A VERY

1136
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:06,433
DIFFICULT SITUATION, AND THEY

1137
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,866
HAVE TO JUST BALANCE, OFTEN,

1138
00:29:07,933 --> 00:29:09,009
THE COST-BENEFIT WHEN THEY HAVE

1139
00:29:09,033 --> 00:29:09,600
NO CHOICE WITH REGARD TO PAYING

1140
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:10,433
A RANSOM.

1141
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,166
COLONIAL IS A PRIVATE COMPANY,

1142
00:29:12,233 --> 00:29:14,300
AND WE'LL DEFER INFORMATION

1143
00:29:14,366 --> 00:29:15,600
REGARDING THEIR DECISION ON

1144
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:18,833
PAYING A RANSOM TO THEM.

1145
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,700
OKAY, SO YOU'D LIKE

1146
00:29:20,766 --> 00:29:21,766
THEM TO PAY THE RANSOM.

1147
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:22,400
YOU'D LIKE THE GAS BACK, AND

1148
00:29:22,466 --> 00:29:23,200
THE EASIEST WAY TO GET

1149
00:29:23,266 --> 00:29:23,966
THE GAS BACK IS TO PAY

1150
00:29:24,033 --> 00:29:25,209
THE RANSOM, SO YOU'D LIKE THEM

1151
00:29:25,233 --> 00:29:26,333
TO PAY THE RANSOM.

1152
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,509
IT'S A PRETTY STRONG HINT, AND

1153
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:28,709
YOU GET THE FEELING THAT IF THE

1154
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:29,973
HINT DOESN'T WORK, JOE BIDEN IS

1155
00:29:30,033 --> 00:29:30,633
GOING TO TAKE THEIR COMPUTER AND

1156
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,900
PAY FOR THEM.

1157
00:29:31,966 --> 00:29:33,300
IF THAT RUSSIAN GRANDMA CAN

1158
00:29:33,366 --> 00:29:34,766
FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE BITCOIN,

1159
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:37,200
THERE'S A 30% CHANCE JOE CAN

1160
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:37,733
TOO.

1161
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,700
BUT THERE HAS TO BE A MIDDLE

1162
00:29:39,766 --> 00:29:41,400
GROUND BETWEEN "JUST KILL THEM"

1163
00:29:41,466 --> 00:29:42,400
AND "JUST PAY THEM."

1164
00:29:42,466 --> 00:29:43,800
BECAUSE MOST PUNISHMENTS... AND

1165
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:45,466
THIS IS TRUE... FALL SOMEWHERE

1166
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,466
BETWEEN "DEATH SENTENCE" AND

1167
00:29:46,533 --> 00:29:48,766
"A CASH REWARD."

1168
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,300
AND THE PROBLEM IS, THE MORE WE

1169
00:29:50,366 --> 00:29:51,800
PAY, THE MORE THESE KINDS OF

1170
00:29:51,866 --> 00:29:53,433
ATTACKS WILL BE ENCOURAGED,

1171
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,933
AND THE MORE WELL-FUNDED THEY

1172
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,200
END UP BEING.

1173
00:29:56,266 --> 00:29:58,666
SO MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE

1174
00:29:58,733 --> 00:30:00,033
HERE... AND I WILL SAY, ON THE

1175
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,966
GOVERNMENT LEVEL, THERE ARE SOME

1176
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:05,866
ENCOURAGING SIGNS.

1177
00:30:05,933 --> 00:30:06,976
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT RECENTLY

1178
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,133
CALLED A TAX FORCED TO CURTAIL

1179
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,000
THE PROLIFERATION OF RANSOMWARE

1180
00:30:10,066 --> 00:30:11,142
ATTACKS, DOES FEEL A LITTLE LATE

1181
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:13,533
TO BE FORMING A TASK FORCE BUT

1182
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,266
IT IS DEFINITELY BETTER THAN

1183
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:16,500
NEVER.

1184
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:20,633
ALSO THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL

1185
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,742
A BILLION DOLLARS FOR IMPROVING

1186
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:22,433
THE CYBERSECURITY OF LOCAL

1187
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,333
GOVERNMENTS.

1188
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,266
BUT THE THING IS,

1189
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:26,133
IT'S NOT JUST UP TO THE

1190
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,766
GOVERNMENT TO TAKE CYBERSECURITY

1191
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:27,233
A LOT MORE SERIOUSLY.

1192
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:27,900
COMPANIES AND PRIVATE

1193
00:30:27,966 --> 00:30:28,633
INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO STEP UP,

1194
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,533
TOO.

1195
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,840
AND THERE ARE SOME BASIC THINGS

1196
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,133
THAT WE SHOULD ALL ABSOLUTELY

1197
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,066
BE DOING.

1198
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:34,600
FIRST, SET UP MULTI-FACTOR

1199
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,742
AUTHENTICATION... DO IT RIGHT

1200
00:30:35,766 --> 00:30:36,533
NOW!

1201
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,900
SECOND, KEEP YOUR COMPUTERS UP

1202
00:30:38,966 --> 00:30:40,366
TO DATE, AND ALSO, DON'T CLICK

1203
00:30:40,433 --> 00:30:41,300
ON SUSPICIOUS EMAILS.

1204
00:30:41,366 --> 00:30:42,509
AND I KNOW THAT THOSE MEASURES

1205
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:44,300
SOUND SMALL WHEN WE'RE FACING

1206
00:30:44,366 --> 00:30:45,366
SOMETHING SO TERRIFYING.

1207
00:30:45,433 --> 00:30:46,433
BUT IN A WORLD WHERE MOST

1208
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,233
PEOPLE'S DOORS ARE UNLOCKED

1209
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,700
AND WIDE OPEN, JUST LOCKING YOUR

1210
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:55,166
DOOR MIGHT BE A DETERRENT.

1211
00:30:55,233 --> 00:30:56,276
THE FACT IS, IT'S IN EVERYONE'S

1212
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,166
INTEREST TO GET THIS UNDER

1213
00:30:57,233 --> 00:30:58,313
CONTROL, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW,

1214
00:30:58,366 --> 00:31:01,100
IT REALLY, REALLY ISN'T.

1215
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:02,100
TO THE POINT THAT IT MAY WELL BE

1216
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:03,400
TIME FOR A NEW AD CAMPAIGN TO

1217
00:31:03,466 --> 00:31:04,933
DRILL HOME JUST HOW VULNERABLE

1218
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,033
ALL OF US ARE.

1219
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,433
HAVE YOU EVER LOST ACCESS TO

1220
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,866
YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS?

1221
00:31:15,933 --> 00:31:16,833
WHAT THE FUCK?

1222
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,500
HOW TO WORK OUT TO MAKE A BET

1223
00:31:19,566 --> 00:31:20,100
GOING TRANSFER JUST SO YOU CAN

1224
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:22,266
SEE PHOTOS OF YOUR GRANDCHILDREN

1225
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:22,766
AGAIN?

1226
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:26,066
OR SEND A FAX FROM THE BEACH?

1227
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:28,066
WHAT ARE YOU, SOME KIND OF BEACH

1228
00:31:28,133 --> 00:31:28,433
BUSINESS?

1229
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,700
HAVE YOU EVER OPEN YOUR LAPTOP

1230
00:31:29,733 --> 00:31:32,400
TO SEE A CLOWN'S FACE DEMANDING

1231
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:32,666
$300,000?

1232
00:31:32,733 --> 00:31:35,466
YOU KNOW WHAT, ALL RIGHT.

1233
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:36,933
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?

1234
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,266
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

1235
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:41,966
OR JAVIER BUTT PLUG AND

1236
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:43,100
EXCITEDLY TAKEN OVER BY

1237
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:44,100
UKRAINIAN HACKERS.

1238
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:44,833
YOU WILL.

1239
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,500
OH, NO, NOT THAT.

1240
00:31:46,566 --> 00:31:49,233
UNLESS WE LOST OUR TAKING THE

1241
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,766
ISSUE OF RANSOMWARE A LOT MORE

1242
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:52,866
SERIOUSLY.

1243
00:31:52,933 --> 00:31:55,233
SO PLEASE, HE WAS TWO FACTOR

1244
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,866
AUTHENTICATION TO SECURE ALL

1245
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:57,966
YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS,

1246
00:31:58,033 --> 00:32:01,133
EMAILS, AND BUTT PLUGS.

1247
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,500
HI, TECH SUPPORT?

1248
00:32:03,566 --> 00:32:04,900
ESPECIALLY THE BUTT PLUGS.

1249
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:06,166
IT IS HAPPENING AGAIN.

1250
00:32:06,233 --> 00:32:08,233
IF YOU THINK YOU CAN IGNORE

1251
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,033
THIS PROBLEM AND WILL NEVER BE

1252
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,033
THE VICTIM OF RANSOMWARE, TRUST

1253
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:13,466
US...

1254
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:16,533
YOU WILL.

1255
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,100
OH, YEAH, YOU DEFINITELY

1256
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:18,166
WILL.

1257
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:22,866
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

1258
00:32:22,933 --> 00:32:23,866
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

1259
00:32:23,933 --> 00:32:27,166
WE WILL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

1260
00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:28,233
GOOD NIGHT.
