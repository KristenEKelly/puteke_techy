1
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:28,326
HI THERE!
WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

2
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,266
STILL TAKING PLACE

3
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,500
IN THIS BLANK VOID.

4
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:31,466
I'VE NICKNAMED IT

5
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:32,666
"PRINCE PHILLIP'S COFFIN"

6
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:33,742
BECAUSE IT'S A SAD LITTLE BOX

7
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:35,009
CONTAINING A RAPIDLY DECOMPOSING

8
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:36,466
BRITISH MAN.

9
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:37,966
AND LOOK, IN THE WAKE OF

10
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:39,366
THE SHOOTING OF DAUNTE WRIGHT

11
00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:40,609
LAST SUNDAY, I CAN SAFELY SAY:

12
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:41,233
THIS WEEK HAS BEEN A FUCKING

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,000
NIGHTMARE.

14
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:44,600
FROM THE NEWS HE WAS PULLED OVER

15
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:45,826
FOR MINOR TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS,

16
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:46,866
INCLUDING HAVING AN

17
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:48,433
AIR FRESHENER HANGING

18
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,400
ON HIS REAR VIEW MIRROR,

19
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,000
TO THE 26-YEAR-VETERAN OF

20
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:52,533
THE POLICE FORCE WHO KILLED HIM

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,366
CLAIMING IT WAS SOMEHOW AN

22
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:56,100
ACCIDENT, TO THE LOCAL POLICE

23
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:56,700
DEPARTMENT FLYING A THIN BLUE

24
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:57,600
LINE FLAG AFTER THE SHOOTING.

25
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:58,666
WHICH IS JUST CORN-FED,

26
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:00,866
DEEP FRIED BULLSHIT.

27
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:02,400
THE WEEK SANK INTO A

28
00:01:02,466 --> 00:01:03,666
DEPRESSINGLY FAMILIAR CYCLE,

29
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:05,333
WITH THE PRESIDENT INSISTING ON

30
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,800
"PEACEFUL PROTEST"... WHICH IS

31
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,233
SO OFTEN JUST ANOTHER WAY TO

32
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,166
PRIORITIZE COMPLIANCE OVER

33
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:10,566
RIGHTEOUS DISSENT,

34
00:01:10,633 --> 00:01:11,966
AND TO PROTECT PROPERTY OVER

35
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:12,866
HUMAN LIVES.

36
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:14,053
AND THOSE KIND OF CALLS WERE

37
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,166
ESPECIALLY GALLING, GIVEN

38
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:15,866
LAW ENFORCEMENT'S

39
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:17,800
ANYTHING-BUT-PEACEFUL RESPONSE,

40
00:01:17,866 --> 00:01:18,866
AS POLICE FIRED TEAR GAS,

41
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,600
RUBBER BULLETS, AND FLASH BANG

42
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:21,966
GRENADES AT PROTESTORS,

43
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:22,933
CREATING MORE TENSION AND

44
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,333
ANXIETY IN AN ALREADY

45
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,766
EMOTIONALLY EXHAUSTED CITY.

46
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,566
AND LOOK, WE COULD KEEP UP OUR

47
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:30,566
PART IN THAT CYCLE.

48
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,333
RIGHT NOW, I COULD CITE

49
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,600
STATISTICS ABOUT POLICE USING

50
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:36,266
EXCESSIVE FORCE.

51
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:37,333
I COULD DUNK ON ALL THE

52
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,666
APPALLING RESPONSES FROM

53
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:40,000
CONSERVATIVE MEDIA FIGURES.

54
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:40,966
I COULD REITERATE, YET AGAIN,

55
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:42,076
THAT WHAT HAPPENED IS COMPLETELY

56
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,400
WRONG, BUT THE FACT IS,

57
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:44,642
WE COULDN'T EVEN FINISH WRITING

58
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:45,800
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO

59
00:01:45,866 --> 00:01:46,900
DAUNTE WRIGHT BEFORE

60
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:48,042
THE CITY OF CHICAGO RELEASED

61
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,333
VIDEO OF ONE OF THEIR OFFICERS

62
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,966
KILLING A 13-YEAR-OLD UNARMED

63
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:53,042
CHILD, ADAM TOLEDO... FOOTAGE

64
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:54,366
WHICH CLEARLY CONTRADICTED

65
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:55,766
THE PICTURE OF AN

66
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,566
"ARMED CONFRONTATION" PAINTED BY

67
00:01:57,633 --> 00:01:59,266
THE POLICE AND THE MAYOR,

68
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:04,533
AS WELL AS A PROSECUTOR WHO'D

69
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,933
SAID TOLEDO HAD A GUN IN HIS

70
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,633
HAND WHEN HE WAS SHOT.

71
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,033
WHICH HE DID NOT.

72
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,633
AND THAT REVELATION BEGAN

73
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,766
THE CYCLE OF PROTESTS,

74
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:10,533
CALLS FOR PEACE, AND POLICE

75
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,866
OVERREACTION ALL OVER AGAIN.

76
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:12,766
AND HERE IS THE THING.

77
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:13,633
THIS SHOW HAS BEEN ON THE AIR

78
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,100
FOR SEVEN YEARS NOW.

79
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,500
WHICH, I KNOW, SOME MIGHT ARGUE

80
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:17,933
IS EIGHT YEARS TOO MANY.

81
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,233
AND IN THAT TIME, WE HAVE

82
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,433
REPEATEDLY COVERED

83
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,033
THE MULTIPLE WAYS POLICE

84
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,000
TERRORIZE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

85
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:24,733
IN THIS COUNTRY.

86
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,100
WE'VE DONE STORIES ON POLICE

87
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,800
MILITARIZATION, ON THEIR OVERUSE

88
00:02:27,866 --> 00:02:29,133
OF MUNICIPAL VIOLATIONS

89
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,900
AND RAIDS, ON THEIR LACK OF

90
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:32,400
ACCOUNTABILITY, AND ON HOW

91
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:34,200
THE HISTORY OF POLICING IN

92
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:35,166
AMERICA IS INEXTRICABLY LINKED

93
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:36,533
WITH WHITE SUPREMACY.

94
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,500
AND I COULD MAKE THE SAME

95
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:39,633
ARGUMENTS TO YOU AGAIN NOW.

96
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,600
I COULD DESCRIBE THE PROBLEM TO

97
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:41,809
YOU, BUT I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT

98
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,633
...AND WHO... IT IS.

99
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,133
I CAN OFFER SOLUTIONS, BUT I

100
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,866
THINK YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE.

101
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,800
I CAN OFFER ANGER, BUT IF YOU'RE

102
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:50,400
A SENTIENT HUMAN BEING ALIVE

103
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:51,933
RIGHT NOW AND YOU'RE NOT ALREADY

104
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,600
FULL OF THAT, I HONESTLY DON'T

105
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,633
KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO YOU.

106
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,200
BECAUSE THE FACT IS,

107
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:57,600
BLACK PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BE

108
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:58,676
MOWED DOWN BY THE POLICE THAT

109
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,400
THEY PAY FOR.

110
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:01,542
AND IF YOU'VE WATCHED THE NEWS

111
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:02,900
AT ALL THIS WEEK, YOU'RE

112
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:03,966
PROBABLY EXHAUSTED.

113
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,466
BLACK PEOPLE IN AMERICA

114
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:06,766
DEFINITELY ARE.

115
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,466
NOT JUST FROM THIS WEEK,

116
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:09,400
BUT ALSO FROM THE, Y'KNOW,

117
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:11,066
EVERYTHING.

118
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:13,000
THE BLACK WRITERS ON THIS STAFF

119
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:13,800
SET UP AN OUT OF OFFICE REPLY

120
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:18,666
THAT JUST SAYS, "NAH."

121
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:19,909
AND HONESTLY, I KIND OF GET IT.

122
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,166
SO GIVEN ALL THAT, WE THOUGHT

123
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:22,600
TONIGHT WE'D TRY AND BREAK OUR

124
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:23,900
PART IN THIS CYCLE AND INSTEAD

125
00:03:23,966 --> 00:03:25,666
ATTEMPT TO DO SOMETHING

126
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:26,866
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

127
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:27,500
BECAUSE WE'VE DECIDED TO GIVE

128
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:28,133
ANYONE WHO NEEDS IT A CHANCE TO

129
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,466
REGROUP.

130
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:32,133
AND THE NEXT SEVEN MINUTES ARE

131
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,242
FOR ANYONE WHO'S FELT CRUSHED

132
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:34,100
BY THIS WEEK.

133
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,100
IF YOU CAN'T WATCH THOSE CLIPS

134
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:35,933
AGAIN, WE'RE NOT GOING TO SHOW

135
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,133
THEM TO YOU.

136
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,000
INSTEAD, WE'RE GOING TO

137
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,633
HOPEFULLY PROVIDE SOME TINY

138
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,400
PIECES OF STUPID, SILLY JOY

139
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:42,366
BEFORE WE ALL PLUNGE BACK INTO

140
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:45,433
THE FIGHT.

141
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,233
AND SO THAT IS WHY OUR FIRST

142
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,133
STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS A GIANT

143
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,366
BUNNY.

144
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:50,833
SPECIFICALLY, ONE THAT'S GONE

145
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,566
MISSING.

146
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:52,533
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "YOU'RE

147
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,400
NOT SERIOUSLY GOING TO TALK

148
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:56,200
ABOUT A GIANT BUNNY RIGHT NOW,"

149
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:56,800
...WELL, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE

150
00:03:56,866 --> 00:04:00,900
BUNNY YET.

151
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:03,400
POLICE ARE SEARCHING FOR A

152
00:04:03,466 --> 00:04:04,000
GUINNESS WORLD RECORD HOLDING

153
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:04,366
RABBIT.

154
00:04:04,433 --> 00:04:05,300
DARIUS, THE RABBIT RECORD

155
00:04:05,366 --> 00:04:06,633
BREAKER, LAST SEEN IN HIS

00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,300
HUTCH-CUM-SHED, LAST SATURDAY.

157
00:04:08,366 --> 00:04:09,576
AS THE WORLD'S LONGEST BUNNY HIS

158
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,633
OWNER IS DESPERATE TO FIND HIM.

159
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,066
ANNETTE EDWARDS TWEETED, "A VERY

160
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:15,300
SAD DAY.

161
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:16,406
THERE IS A REWARD OF 1,000

162
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:17,700
POUNDS.

163
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:19,566
DARIUS IS TOO OLD TO BREED NOW.

164
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:23,400
SO PLEASE BRING HIM BACK."

165
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:24,500
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT,

166
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,342
BIG RABBIT GOT TAKEN LIKE IN

167
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:26,966
"TAKEN."

168
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:30,833
LOOK AT THAT LONG LAD!

169
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,200
AND BY THE WAY, AN APPEAL TO

00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:32,733
THE RABBIT SNATCHERS WITH

171
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,533
"BRING HIM BACK, HE'S OLD,

172
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,100
HE'S SHOOTING BLANKS.

173
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:34,866
HE'S USELESS"?

174
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:36,093
QUIT PUTTING DARIUS' BUSINESS

175
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:37,766
OUT THERE IN THE STREETS.

176
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,800
EVEN IN MIDDLE AGE, DARIUS IS

177
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:40,700
A HOTROD WHOSE GOT YEARS OF

178
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:41,566
BURROWING AND BANGING LEFT.

179
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:42,666
GIVE HIM THE RESPECT

180
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:44,300
HE DESERVES.

181
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:46,833
AND THE FACT THIS BUNNY BEHEMOTH

182
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,266
IS MISSING REALLY SOURS THIS

183
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,733
CLIP OF DARIUS AND HIS OWNER

184
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,200
FROM HAPPIER TIMES.

185
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:53,800
HE'S NOW BRINGING OUT

186
00:04:53,866 --> 00:04:54,986
CHILDREN'S BOOKS, HE'S DOING

187
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:55,666
A CALENDAR, HE'S DOING

188
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:56,733
A WORLD TOUR.

189
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,166
THERE'S NO STOPPING DARIUS!

190
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:00,333
WELL, IT TURNS OUT

191
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,500
THERE WAS ONE WAY TO STOP

192
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:03,733
DARIUS!

193
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,500
AND THAT'S STRAIGHT SNATCHING UP

194
00:05:04,566 --> 00:05:06,033
ALL 51 EXTREMELY WEIRD INCHES OF

195
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,833
HIM.

196
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,433
I GUESS PRIDE GOETH BEFORE

197
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,300
THE FALL, AND AGGRESSIVE

198
00:05:10,366 --> 00:05:10,866
COMMODIFICATION GOETH BEFORE

199
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:12,833
THE JUMBO JACKRABBIT JACKING.

200
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,800
AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THIS

201
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:16,166
ABSOLUTE MONSTROSITY WAS NOT

202
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,533
THE ONLY BLISSFULLY STUPID STORY

203
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,266
THIS WEEK.

204
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,466
FOR A FEW DAYS, THE INTERNET

205
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:21,666
LIT UP WITH THE CLAIM THAT

206
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:22,742
USHER TIPPED VEGAS STRIPPERS

207
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:24,100
IN USHER BUCKS WITH HIS FACE

208
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,033
ON THEM.

209
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,666
WHICH, ON THE ONE HAND, IS

210
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:27,973
ICONIC, BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND,

211
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,300
IS FUCKING ICONIC.

212
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:30,766
AND I WOULDN'T BLAME THE DANCERS

213
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,166
FOR BEING MAD ABOUT ENDING

214
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,100
THEIR NIGHT WITH A THONG FULL OF

215
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,666
USHER SELFIES.

216
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:36,942
ALTHOUGH, I DO HAVE TO TELL YOU,

217
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:38,366
THE STRIP CLUB INSISTS USHER

218
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:39,442
DIDN'T USE FAKE MONEY TO TIP

219
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:40,500
THE DANCERS, ADDING,

220
00:05:40,566 --> 00:05:42,066
"HE CONVERTED THOUSANDS OF

221
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,466
REAL DOLLARS TO TIP THEM" AND

222
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:44,966
"USHER WAS A TRUE GENTLEMAN."

223
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:46,733
BUT TO ME, THAT ACTUALLY MAKES

224
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,040
THIS STORY EVEN BETTER, BECAUSE

225
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:49,400
"USHER WAS A TRUE GENTLEMAN" IS

226
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:50,266
NOW MY FAVORITE THING I'VE EVER

227
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,166
BEEN LEGALLY REQUIRED TO

228
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:52,966
CLARIFY.

229
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:54,333
AND THEN THERE WAS THIS.

230
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,766
WE'RE GETTING A LOOK AT WHAT

231
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:57,300
SOME ATHLETES WILL WEAR AT

232
00:05:57,366 --> 00:05:59,100
THE SUMMER OLYMPICS IN TOKYO.

233
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,533
RALPH LAUREN UNVEILED THESE

234
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,433
UNIFORMS FOR TEAM USA.

235
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,466
THIS ENSEMBLE WILL BE WORN

236
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:07,066
DURING THE CLOSING CEREMONY AND,

237
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,033
OKAY, I'M JUST GOING TO

238
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,166
THAT IS A TERRIBLE

239
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:09,766
OUTFIT.

240
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:10,873
THEY LOOK LIKE THE CAST OF

241
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,076
A CBS SCI-FI DRAMA THAT NO ONE'S

242
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,766
EVER HEARD OF DESPITE BEING ON

243
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:13,966
THE AIR FOR 16 SEASONS.

244
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:15,500
ALSO, WHY IS THE U.S. OLYMPIC

245
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:17,000
TEAM ALWAYS OUTFITTED BY

246
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:18,700
RALPH LAUREN, WHICH HAS BEEN

247
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:20,700
HANDLING IT SINCE 2008, AND HAS

248
00:06:20,766 --> 00:06:21,942
CONSISTENTLY PRODUCED SHIT LIKE

249
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:25,566
THIS, THIS, AND THIS... AN

250
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:26,566
OUTFIT THAT DOESN'T SCREAM,

251
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:27,833
"I'M GOING TO THE OLYMPICS!"

252
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,300
SO MUCH AS IT SCREAMS,

253
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:28,833
"YOU THINK I'M RICH NOW?

254
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,133
WAIT TILL MY DAD DIES!"

255
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,100
I'M JUST SAYING, IT IS A CHOICE

256
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,433
TO TAKE A DIVERSE COUNTRY OF

257
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,566
300-PLUS MILLION PEOPLE AND

258
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:37,133
GO WITH THE AESTHETIC OF

259
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,133
THE BAD GUY IN EVERY '80s

260
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,633
FRAT COMEDY.

261
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,733
ALTHOUGH TO BE FAIR, OUR OLYMPIC

262
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,166
OUTFITS WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES

263
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:45,533
GRABBING ATTENTION THIS WEEK.

264
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,366
HERE'S THE TEAM CANADA

265
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:47,733
UNIFORM.

266
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,166
OKAY.

267
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:50,800
I LOVE IT.

268
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:52,000
YOU LOVE IT?

269
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:55,700
I DO LOVE IT.

270
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:56,600
IT'S BILLED AS A TWIST ON

271
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,266
THE ICONIC CANADIAN TUXEDO.

272
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,200
OKAY, THAT JACKET IS

273
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:02,066
STRAIGHT GARBAGE.

274
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:03,173
IT LOOKS LIKE JAY LENO GOT

275
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:04,273
TAGGED BY A STREET GANG OF

276
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:09,500
EIGHT-YEAR-OLD GIRLS.

277
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:10,806
AND THAT JACKET MIGHT LOOK GOOD

278
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:11,200
ON ONE PERSON.

279
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:12,376
THE PROBLEM IS, ON A GROUP OF

280
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,542
HUNDREDS, THEY'RE ALL GOING TO

281
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,033
LOOK LIKE A HIGH SCHOOL

282
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,666
PRODUCTION OF CANADIAN "GREASE."

283
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:16,333
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY,

284
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,333
I'VE ALWAYS FELT IT'S WRONG THAT

285
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,566
"CANADIAN TUXEDO" REFERS TO

286
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:20,066
HEAD-TO-TOE DENIM, AND NOT

287
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:22,866
FORMALWEAR SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED

288
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:24,266
FOR A FANCY MOOSE.

289
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,376
THIS BIG BOY KNOWS WHAT'S UP.

290
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,333
BLAST ME, KING.

291
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,633
AND IF THAT WASN'T ALREADY FUN

292
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,466
ENOUGH NEWS FROM CANADA THIS

293
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,100
WEEK, THERE WAS ALSO THIS:

294
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:32,766
THIS IS A MEMBER OF THE

295
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,100
CANADIAN PARLIAMENT WHO WAS

296
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,166
CAUGHT NAKED...

297
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,600
NAKED ON A VIRTUAL

298
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,966
HOUSE OF COMMONS MEETING.

299
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:44,133
HE HAS SINCE APOLOGIZED IN AN

300
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,442
SAYING HE HAD BEEN CHANGING INTO

301
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:46,966
HIS WORK CLOTHES AFTER GOING FOR

302
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:47,500
A JOG.

303
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:51,033
QUITE WHY HE DID THAT IN FRONT

304
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,500
OF A CAMERA, I MEAN, WHO KNOWS.

305
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:55,466
NOW, OBVIOUSLY,

306
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:58,900
I FEEL TERRIBLE FOR THAT MAN.

307
00:07:58,966 --> 00:07:59,866
IT WAS CLEARLY A COMPLETE

308
00:07:59,933 --> 00:08:00,633
ACCIDENT.

309
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,500
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, HE'S GOT

310
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:03,933
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO BE

311
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,333
ASHAMED OF THERE.

312
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:04,900
HE'S KEEPIN' TIGHT AND HE'S

313
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:05,800
KEEPIN' IT RIGHT.

314
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:06,766
HE'S MAINTAINING WHILE THE REST

315
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:07,400
OF US ARE GAINING.

316
00:08:07,466 --> 00:08:07,866
A JOG?

317
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:08,733
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORK DAY?

318
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,633
THAT IS HOT MALE BEHAVIOR.

319
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,000
I HAVEN'T TAKEN A JOG

320
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:12,766
IN THE MIDDLE OF A WORK DAY

321
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,566
SINCE SEPTEMBER 11th.

322
00:08:14,633 --> 00:08:16,533
AND BY THE WAY, IF YOU THINK HE

323
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,333
LOOKS GOOD WITH HIS CLOTHES OFF,

324
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:17,900
WAIT TIL YOU SEE HIM WITH

325
00:08:17,966 --> 00:08:18,833
CLOTHES ON.

326
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,866
HEY, CANADA!

327
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,100
CHECK YOUR CARBON EMISSIONS,

328
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,242
BECAUSE THERE'S A MASSIVE SMOKE

329
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:25,666
STACK IN YOUR PARLIAMENT.

330
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:28,433
AND I HAVE TO SAY, IT'S TRULY

331
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,733
DELIGHTFUL WATCHING A NEWS

332
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,266
PACKAGE THAT'S JUST "TIMID MAN

333
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:32,900
POLITELY GIGGLES OVER PHOTO OF

334
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:33,533
NAKED PALE GUY," OR AS IT'S MORE

335
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,200
"HARD CORE

336
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:37,866
CANADIAN PORN."

337
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:39,866
AND AS IF THIS STORY COULDN'T

338
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:40,833
GET ANY BETTER, JUST WATCH HIS

339
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,109
FELLOW M.P. ADDRESS THE INCIDENT

340
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:43,900
IN THE MOST EXCEEDINGLY TACTFUL

341
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:45,833
WAY.

342
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,966
WE'VE SEEN A MEMBER DURING

343
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:51,433
QUESTION PERIOD IMPROPERLY

344
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,766
DRESSED... THAT IS, UNCLOTHED.

345
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,800
WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE MEMBER WAS

346
00:08:56,866 --> 00:08:58,733
IN VERY GOOD SHAPE, BUT I THINK

347
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,566
THAT THIS MEMBER SHOULD BE

348
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:01,809
REMINDED OF WHAT IS APPROPRIATE

349
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:02,733
AND TO CONTROL HIS CAMERA.

350
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
THANK YOU.

351
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:06,066
THAT IS AN AGGRESSIVELY

352
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:07,933
CANADIAN RESPONSE.

353
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,233
SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT

354
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,766
CANADIANS... AND THESE OUTFITS

355
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,900
SAY MORE THAN ANYONE EVER COULD

356
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:13,833
...BUT ONE THING YOU CAN'T

357
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,266
ACCUSE THEM OF IS BEING

358
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,493
IMPOLITE, EVEN IN THE FACE OF

359
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:22,466
UNREQUESTED NUDITY.

360
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:23,813
AND WHILE I AM REALLY SORRY THAT

361
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:24,733
HAPPENED TO THIS GUY, WHO SEEMS

362
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,700
TO HAVE WEATHERED THE INCIDENT

363
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:29,000
WITH GOOD GRACE, I HONESTLY

364
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:29,833
NEEDED THIS STORY THIS WEEK.

365
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,976
AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE FACT

366
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,800
THAT DESPITE THIS BEING ENTIRELY

367
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:32,466
COMPLIMENTARY, "THE DAILY BEAST"

368
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:33,400
WILL UNDENIABLY WRITE IT UP

369
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:35,266
TOMORROW WITH THE HEADLINE,

370
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,233
"JOHN OLIVER EVISCERATES THIS

371
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,933
CANADIAN'S HOG."

372
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,400
THE POINT IS, A BUNCH OF FUN,

373
00:09:40,466 --> 00:09:42,033
WEIRD SHIT HAPPENED THIS WEEK!

374
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,200
AND WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU A

375
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:45,566
CHANCE TO LAUGH AT IT, TO GIVE

376
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:46,966
YOU JUST A BREATH AT THE END OF

377
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:48,400
A TRULY DEMORALIZING WEEK.

378
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:49,966
SO IF YOU NEEDED A BREAK,

379
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:52,266
I REALLY HOPE THAT GAVE YOU ONE.

380
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,233
AND IF YOU DIDN'T NEED A BREAK,

381
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,309
MAYBE ASK YOURSELF WHY THE FUCK

382
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,400
NOT, AND THINK ABOUT THAT

383
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:58,033
FOR A WHILE.

384
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,066
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, IT'S ONCE

385
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,966
AGAIN MADE PAINFULLY CLEAR THAT

386
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:04,500
WE... AND WHEN I SAY "WE," I

387
00:10:04,566 --> 00:10:06,100
MEAN WHITE AMERICA... HAVE TO

388
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,200
STOP TALKING ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL

389
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:09,533
CHANGE IN POLICING AND ACTUALLY

390
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,733
MAKE IT HAPPEN.

391
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,400
BECAUSE THIS CYCLE OF STATE

392
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:13,700
VIOLENCE AGAINST BLACK LIVES

393
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:15,933
HAS TO BE STOPPED.

394
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,042
SO PUT ON YOUR SHOES, LEAVE THE

395
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:20,333
HOUSE, MARCH IN THE STREETS, AND

396
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,700
DEMAND A BETTER COUNTRY, ONE IN

397
00:10:21,766 --> 00:10:23,700
WHICH BLACK PEOPLE ARE TREATED

398
00:10:23,766 --> 00:10:25,800
WITH FUNDAMENTAL RESPECT, AND

399
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:27,233
ONE IN WHICH THE BIG NEWS OF

400
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,800
THE WEEK GENUINELY COULD BE

401
00:10:28,866 --> 00:10:29,600
"IMPRACTICALLY LARGE RABBIT GOES

402
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:30,533
MISSING."

403
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,200
AND NOW, THIS.

404
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,033
AND NOW...

405
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,100
THE COMMERCIALS ON FOX NEWS IN

406
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,833
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT OF

00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,900
EXACTLY WHO THEY ARE TALKING TO.

408
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:47,800
MEN OVER 45, DO YOU HAVE A

409
00:10:47,866 --> 00:10:53,466
FREQUENT, URGENT NEED TO

410

URINATE?

411
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,733

SPEETWO URINATE.

00:10:57,933 --> 00:10:59,833
GUYS, ARE YOU DONE WITH 2020?

414
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,900
ALL THE BAGGAGE THAT CAME ALONG

415
00:11:01,966 --> 00:11:03,033
WITH IT?

416
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,666
GUYS, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

417
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:05,900
YOU CAN'T GET IT BACK.

418
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:08,833
AS WE GET OLDER, WE ALL LOSE

419
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,166

GUYS, IT'S THAT TIME AND

424
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,000
NOTHING IS HAPPENING.

425
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:18,966
GUYS.

426
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:19,200
GUYS.

427
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:23,600
GUYS, WAKING UP OVER AND OVER

428
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,666
TO URINATE IS NOT OKAY.

429
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:27,566
MOVING ON.

430
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:28,466
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

431
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:29,066
BANKRUPTCY.

432
00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:30,500
YOU PROBABLY KNOW IT FROM BEING

433
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:31,400
THE WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME ON

434
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:32,833
"WHEEL OF FORTUNE," ASIDE FROM

435
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,366
HUGGING PAT SAJAK OR WINNING A

436
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:35,700
MITSUBISHI MIRAGE.

437
00:11:35,766 --> 00:11:36,666
OR MAYBE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH IT

438
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:38,033
THROUGH ADS FOR BANKRUPTCY

439
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,166
LAWYERS LIKE THIS:

440
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:40,666
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS

441
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,733
A FAIR MAIDEN NAMED MARY.

442
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,733
MARY LIVED A STORYBOOK LIFE

443
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,000
UNTIL HER PRINCE CHARMING WAS

444
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:48,733
SMASHED FROM HIS STEED, THEN HER

445
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,266
CASTLE CAME UNDER SIEGE AND THE

446
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,533
CRIES OF ASSAULT WERE VEXING.

447
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,000
HER CHAMPION HAD BEEN GRAVELY

448
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:57,300
INJURED AND A POX HAD FALLEN

449
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:59,933
UPON HER HOUSE.

450
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,500
I'VE HELPED THOUSANDS OF

451
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:03,300
CLIENTS LIKE MARY AND I COULD

452
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:03,900
PROBABLY HELP YOU GET A FRESH

453
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:06,000
START.

454
00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:07,733
WOW, THERE IS A LOT

455
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,100
THERE, FROM AN UNMARKED VAN

456
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,766
FULLY "MEAN GIRLS" -ING MARY'S

457
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:12,400
HUSBAND, TO HIM SURVIVING WITH

458
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:13,033
WHAT APPEAR TO BE SURPRISINGLY

459
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,466
MINOR INJURIES, TO THAT LAWYER

460
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,533
CLAIMING HE'S HELPED THOUSANDS

461
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,133
OF CLIENTS LIKE MARY.

462
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,466
MEANING THAT IN THE CHATTANOOGA

463
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:20,100
AREA, THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF

464
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,566
WOMEN WHO'VE WATCHED THEIR

465
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:23,666
HUSBAND GET SHIT STOMPED BY

466
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:25,300
A CARGO VAN, AND TAKE WHAT CAN

467
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:26,300
ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A GATLING

468
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:29,166
GUN OF MAIL TO THE FACE.

469
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:29,833
IF THAT IS TRUE, THEY'VE GOT

470
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,033
A WAY MORE LUCRATIVE LAWSUIT

471
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,400
THAN A BANKRUPTCY CASE.

472
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:34,966
WHAT THAT AD IS PROMISING IS

473
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:36,266
ATTRACTIVE, THOUGH: A FRESH

474
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,733
START FROM YOUR DEBTS.

475
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,233
AND IT'S SOMETHING A LOT OF

476
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:40,700
PEOPLE HAVE TURNED TO.

477
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:41,666
OVER THE PAST DECADE, THE NUMBER

478
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:44,100
OF PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES FILED

479
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:44,733
EACH YEAR HAS RANGED FROM ABOUT

480
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,500
800,000 TO 1.5 MILLION.

481
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:48,866
AND MANY WORRY THAT ONCE

482
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:50,666
THE CURRENT PANDEMIC ASSISTANCE

483
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:53,133
STOPS, MORE AND MORE WILL NEED

484
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,866
THE TYPE OF HELP THAT BANKRUPTCY

485
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:56,133
OFFERS.

486
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,766
BECAUSE VERY BASICALLY,

487
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:03,900
BANKRUPTCY IS A LEGAL PROCEDURE

488
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:06,333
BY WHICH THOSE WHO ARE DEEPLY

489
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:12,066
WEIGHTED DOWN BY

490
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:12,933
DEBTS CAN GET OUT FROM

491
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,866
UNDERNEATH THEM AND THEN START

492
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:14,633
ANEW.

493
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,600
WHICH IS GOOD!

494
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:16,833
ALTHOUGH IT COMES WITH SOME

495
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,180
CONSEQUENCES... IT'LL BE ON YOUR

496
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:18,800
CREDIT REPORT, AND THERE TENDS

497
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:19,466
TO BE SOME SOCIAL STIGMA

498
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:20,542
ATTACHED, AS EXEMPLIFIED IN THIS

499
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:21,033
CLIP FROM "SHARK TANK."

500
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,900
JEFF, I UNDERSTAND YOUR

501
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:23,166
DECISION TO GO BANKRUPT,

502
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:23,833
CLEANS THE SLATE, BUT IT CARRIES

503
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,266
A WEIGHT.

504
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,200
YOU'LL NEVER HAVE A BANK,

505
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:26,733
JEFF.

506
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,733
EVER.

507
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:33,333
TO ME, YOU'RE RADIOACTIVE.

508
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,700
THERE ARE A MILLION PEOPLE

509
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:35,533
OUT THERE WHO ARE GOING TO GET

510
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,100
THE WRONG MESSAGE FROM WHAT

511
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:36,400
YOU'RE SAYING.

512
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:37,609
NO, THEY'RE GETTING THE RIGHT

513
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:38,300
MESSAGE.

514
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:41,033
THEY SHOULD NOT GO BANKRUPT.

515
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,766
WELL, HOLD ON.

516
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:45,400
BECAUSE THAT IS A TERRIBLE

517
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:45,933
LESSON.

518
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,666
AND YOU, KEVIN O'LEARY, ARE

519
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:47,633
HARDLY ONE TO BE CALLING

520
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,966
SOMEONE'S DECISIONS

521
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:52,100
"RADIOACTIVE," GIVEN YOU

522
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:56,633
INVESTED IN COMPANIES WITH

523
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,233
BUSINESS MODELS LIKE:

524
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,533
PUT YOUR FACE ON A POTATO,

525
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,233
LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT

526
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,233
ON A UNICYCLE, AND TOYGAROO,

527
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:00,800
THE NETFLIX FOR TOYS, WHOSE

528
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:02,042
MASCOT ALWAYS LOOKED LIKE IT WAS

529
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:02,833
SEARCHING FOR A PLACE TO TAKE A

530
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,300
SHIT.

531
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:04,633
AND WHICH, INTERESTINGLY, FILED

532
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,133
FOR FUCKING BANKRUPTCY.

533
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,376
SO I'M SORRY, KEVIN, BUT TO ME,

534
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:06,933
THAT MAKES YOU RADIOACTIVE.

535
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,633
I'M OUT!

536
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,833
BUT THAT BROAD-BRUSH

537
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,066
STIGMATIZATION IS COMMON AND

538
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:12,666
COMPLETELY MISGUIDED.

539
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:14,833
BECAUSE BANKRUPTCY IS NOT SOLELY

540
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,166
CAUSED BY BAD DECISIONS, IT'S

541
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:18,633
OFTEN CAUSED BY BAD LUCK:

542
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,566
UNAVOIDABLE CHALLENGES

543
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:21,200
LIKE JOB LOSS, DIVORCE, SURPRISE

544
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:22,833
MEDICAL BILLS, OR PERHAPS EVEN

545
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,333
...Y'KNOW... A ONCE IN A CENTURY

546
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,033
GLOBAL PANDEMIC.

547
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,866
AND DESPITE BANKRUPTCY OFTEN

548
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:28,933
BEING CHARACTERIZED AS AN

549
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,433
"EASY OUT," THE WAY IT'S

550
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,509
CURRENTLY SET UP, IT'S SOMETIMES

551
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:33,300
NOT AN "OUT" AT ALL, AS THIS

552
00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:35,033
COUPLE LEARNED.

553
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,733
BEFORE YOU'RE DONE AND OVER

554
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,466
WITH, YOU'RE DEFINITELY LOOKING

555
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:39,500
TO SPEND AT LEAST $1,000 TO

556
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:42,133
FILE... TO CLAIM BANKRUPTCY.

557
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,766
WE DON'T HAVE $1,000.

558
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,500
ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU CAN'T

559
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:47,600
AFFORD...

560
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,433
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO GO

561
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
BANKRUPT.

562
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:50,800
WE CAN'T, CORRECT.

563
00:14:50,866 --> 00:14:53,400
YET, WE'RE $50,000 IN DEBT.

564
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:54,566
SO, WHAT DO WE DO?

565
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:56,233
YEAH, A LOT OF PEOPLE

566
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,466
CAN'T AFFORD TO GO BANKRUPT.

567
00:14:58,533 --> 00:14:59,700
A TRUE SENTENCE THAT

568
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,966
FUNDAMENTALLY DOESN'T MAKE

569
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:03,900
SENSE, LIKE "SONIC DRIVE-INS

570
00:15:03,966 --> 00:15:05,666
ADVERTISE IN CITIES WHERE THERE

571
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:07,000
ARE NO SONIC LOCATIONS" OR

572
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:07,700
THE SEQUEL TO "NOW YOU SEE ME"

573
00:15:07,766 --> 00:15:09,766
WASN'T CALLED "NOW YOU DON'T,"

574
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:10,733
OR ELON MUSK DOESN'T FUCK HIS

575
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,333
CARS.

576
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,133
I MEAN, COME ON, THAT'S THE

577
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,066
FACE OF A MAN WHO'S AT THE VERY

578
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:18,900
LEAST MEASURED THE CIRCUMFERENCE

579
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:19,366
OF THE CHARGING POINT.

580
00:15:19,433 --> 00:15:20,442
SO GIVEN ALL THAT, TONIGHT,

581
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:21,233
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT PERSONAL

582
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,833
BANKRUPTCY.

583
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,000
OUR MODERN BANKRUPTCY CODE

584
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:26,866
WAS ENACTED IN 1978...

585
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:27,976
INTERESTINGLY, AROUND THE SAME

586
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,900
TIME THAT THE CREDIT CARD

587
00:15:28,966 --> 00:15:30,176
INDUSTRY BEGAN TO ENJOY A PERIOD

588
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,100
OF STEADY DEREGULATION.

589
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,700
WHICH WORKED OUT VERY WELL FOR

590
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:36,300
THEM, BECAUSE THEY MARKETED

591
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:38,000
THEMSELVES AGGRESSIVELY, AND

592
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:39,400
DURING THIS TIME, CONSUMER DEBT

593
00:15:39,466 --> 00:15:40,800
BEGAN TO SHARPLY RISE.

594
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:42,933
AND WHAT THE INDUSTRY CLEARLY

595
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,200
WANTED WAS PEOPLE STUCK IN A

596
00:15:44,266 --> 00:15:45,833
LUCRATIVE CYCLE OF MINIMUM

597
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,600
PAYMENTS, LATE FEES, AND

598
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,033
INTEREST HIKES.

599
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,500
WHAT THEY DIDN'T WANT SPOILING

600
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:52,066
THAT WAS PEOPLE CUTTING THAT

601
00:15:52,133 --> 00:15:52,733
CYCLE SHORT THROUGH BANKRUPTCY.

602
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,900
SO BY THE LATE '90s,

603
00:15:55,966 --> 00:15:56,533
THEY WERE LOBBYING SENATORS LIKE

604
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,333
CHUCK GRASSLEY HARD TO CURB WHAT

605
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,500
THEY FRAMED AS "BANKRUPTCY

606
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:01,433
ABUSE."

607
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,800
BASICALLY ARGUING THAT PEOPLE

608
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:04,366
WHO CAN "AFFORD" TO PAY WERE

609
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:05,300
USING BANKRUPTCY AS AN EASY WAY

610
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,000
TO NOT PAY BILLS AND PASS THE

611
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:11,933
COSTS ON TO THE REST OF US.

612
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,866
AND GRASSLEY SEEMED MORE THAN

613
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:15,500
HAPPY TO REPEAT SOME OF THEIR

614
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:15,866
TALKING POINTS.

615
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:16,733
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE FAMILY

616
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,842
IN AMERICA... LOW INCOME OR HIGH

617
00:16:17,866 --> 00:16:20,133
INCOME... THAT IS NOT PAYING

618
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,500
PART OF THE COST OF BANKRUPTCY.

619
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,666
$40 BILLION COST TO THE ECONOMY

620
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,033
EVERY YEAR.

621
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,633
$400 FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR.

622
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,566
WOW.

623
00:16:30,633 --> 00:16:32,000
THE AVERAGE FAMILY PAYS $400

624
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:33,200
A YEAR BECAUSE DEADBEATS

625
00:16:33,266 --> 00:16:35,166
ABUSE THE SYSTEM.

626
00:16:35,233 --> 00:16:36,733
GRASSLEY DROPPED THAT SHOCKING

627
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,266
"FACT" WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF

628
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,442
A MAN WHO'D LATER TWEET FROM HIS

629
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:40,700
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT,

630
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,033
"WINDSOR HEIGHTS DAIRY QUEEN IS

631
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,066
GOOD PLACE FOR U KNO WHAT."

632
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,333
THE THING IS, THAT $400 FIGURE

633
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,200
IS TOTAL NONSENSE.

634
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:49,466
NO ONE KNOWS FOR CERTAIN WHERE

635
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,200
IT CAME FROM, AND DESPITE IT

636
00:16:51,266 --> 00:16:52,766
TURNING OUT TO BE DEMONSTRABLY

637
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,500
FALSE, THE CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY

638
00:16:54,566 --> 00:16:55,800
PUSHED IT HARD, TO CREATE

639
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:56,933
A NARRATIVE OF WIDESPREAD

640
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,866
IRRESPONSIBILITY AND ABUSE

641
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,300
AROUND BANKRUPTCY.

642
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:02,400
BUT IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO TAKE

643
00:17:02,466 --> 00:17:04,200
MORAL GRANDSTANDING FROM CREDIT

644
00:17:04,266 --> 00:17:05,066
CARD COMPANIES, WHO WERE ALL

645
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:07,066
TOO HAPPY TO HELP PEOPLE GET

646
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:07,900
INTO SIGNIFICANT DEBT, EVEN IF

647
00:17:07,966 --> 00:17:09,166
THEY HAD JUST DECLARED

648
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:11,533
BANKRUPTCY.

649
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,800
BARELY OUT OF BANKRUPTCY

650
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,666
COURT, JOAN BURNETT OPENED HER

651
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,533
THE

652
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,633
CHANCE FOR A SHINY NEW CREDIT

653
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,400
CARD, THE FIRST OF MANY.

654
00:17:21,466 --> 00:17:24,800
IT LOOKED LIKE AN EASY $3,000

655
00:17:24,866 --> 00:17:26,400
AND I THINK I HUNG ON TO IT FOR

656
00:17:26,466 --> 00:17:27,542
A DAY, AND THEN I THOUGHT, "OH

657
00:17:27,566 --> 00:17:27,700
NO.

658
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:28,433
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE THAT

659
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,433
CRAZY."

660
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,633
THE BANKS ARE GIVING OUT

661
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,433
CREDIT WITH A RECKLESS DISREGARD

662
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,000
FOR CONSUMERS' ABILITY TO

663
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:35,900
REPAY.

664
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:37,033
YEAH, THAT MAX WEINBERG

665
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,300
IMPERSONATOR IS RIGHT.

666
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:40,633
AND SO, BY THE WAY, WAS JOAN,

667
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,809
WHOSE SELF-RESTRAINT I REALLY

668
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,600
ADMIRE.

669
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,300
IMAGINE THE EXPENDITURES I COULD

670
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,966
HAVE AVOIDED BY SIMPLY SAYING,

671
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:48,933
"NO, JOHN, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

672
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,066
BE THAT CRAZY, ASK YOURSELF,

673
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:52,733
DO YOU REALLY NEED THIS ITEM?"

674
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,600
BUT YEARS OF LOBBYING BY THE

675
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,066
CREDIT CARD AND BANKING INDUSTRY

676
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:56,833
ULTIMATELY RESULTED

677
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,900
IN A HUGELY SIGNIFICANT 2005

678
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:01,100
"BANKRUPTCY REFORM" BILL,

679
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,000
WHICH MADE IT FAR MORE

680
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:04,266
COMPLICATED TO FILE FOR

681
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,442
BANKRUPTCY THAN IT PREVIOUSLY

682
00:18:05,466 --> 00:18:06,866
HAD BEEN... WHICH IN TURN MADE

683
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:08,533
IT FAR MORE COSTLY, WHICH MEANT

684
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,733
MANY PEOPLE ENDED UP IN A

685
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,300
SITUATION WHERE THEY COULDN'T

686
00:18:11,366 --> 00:18:13,666
AFFORD TO GO BANKRUPT.

687
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:15,466
AND TO UNDERSTAND OUR CURRENT

688
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:17,066
SYSTEM, A KEY THING TO KNOW IS

689
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:20,266
THERE IS NOT ONE MAIN KIND OF

690
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:20,900
PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY, THERE ARE

691
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:21,800
CHAPTER 7 AND

692
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:23,733
CHAPTER 13.

693
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,366
CHAPTER 7 IS WHAT YOU COMMONLY

694
00:18:25,433 --> 00:18:27,300
THINK OF AS BANKRUPTCY.

695
00:18:27,366 --> 00:18:28,933
YOUR DEBTS ARE MOSTLY WIPED OUT.

696
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,766
AND WHILE YOU CAN HOLD ONTO A

697
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,600
FEW ESSENTIAL ASSETS BELOW A

698
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,566
CERTAIN THRESHOLD, THE REST CAN

699
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:37,000
THEN BE SOLD TO PAY OFF

700
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:37,766
YOUR CREDITORS.

701
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,266
IT TAKES A FEW MONTHS TO

702
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,766
COMPLETE, BUT THEN YOU GET YOUR

703
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:42,842
CHANCE AT A "FRESH START."

704
00:18:42,866 --> 00:18:45,033
CHAPTER 13, HOWEVER, IS

705
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,266
DIFFERENT.

706
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,366
THAT IS MORE OF A REORGANIZATION

707
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:48,600
OF DEBT.

708
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,800
BASICALLY, YOUR FINANCES GET

709
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:52,433
EXAMINED TO WORK OUT HOW MUCH

710
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,200
YOU CAN AFFORD TO PAY INTO A

711
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:53,933
REPAYMENT PLAN FOR THREE TO FIVE

712
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,833
YEARS.

713
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,180
AND IF YOU MAKE ALL THE PAYMENTS

714
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:57,533
IN THAT PLAN, AT THE END OF IT,

715
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,333
YOUR DEBTS DO GET DISCHARGED.

716
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,866
AND THIS HAS ITS BENEFITS... YOU

717
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:03,942
DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP ASSETS

718
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:05,066
LIKE A HOUSE OR A CAR.

719
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:08,400
BUT... AND THIS IS A HUGE "BUT"

720
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:09,933
...IF YOU MISS EVEN ONE PAYMENT,

721
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,142
YOUR CASE COULD BE DISMISSED AND

722
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,800
THE WHOLE DEAL IS OFF.

723
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:14,033
YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY BACK AT

724
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,866
SQUARE ONE.

725
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:17,933
AND THE UNCOMFORTABLE FACT IS,

726
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,166
THIS HAPPENS IN MOST CHAPTER 13

727
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:21,242
CASES, BECAUSE ONLY ABOUT A

728
00:19:21,266 --> 00:19:22,500
THIRD ACTUALLY MAKE IT

729
00:19:22,566 --> 00:19:24,800
ALL THE WAY TO DISCHARGE.

730
00:19:24,866 --> 00:19:27,633
AND CHAPTER 13 IS ACTUALLY

731
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,266
MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO FILE.

732
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,966
BECAUSE WHILE ATTORNEYS CHARGE,

733
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:34,466
ON AVERAGE, ABOUT $1300 TO FILE

734
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:36,533
CHAPTER 7, FOR CHAPTER 13, THEY

735
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,633
GENERALLY CHARGE ABOUT $3800.

736
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,533
SO YOU MIGHT BE THINKING, IF

737
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,266
CHAPTER 13 IS MORE COSTLY,

738
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,900
MORE DIFFICULT, AND LESS LIKELY

739
00:19:42,966 --> 00:19:43,700
TO GET YOU A GENUINELY FRESH

740
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:44,500
START, WHY WOULD ANYONE

741
00:19:44,566 --> 00:19:47,200
CHOOSE IT?

742
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:48,566
WELL, FOR SOME, IT MIGHT BE

743
00:19:48,633 --> 00:19:49,900
THE RIGHT FIT... REMEMBER, IT

744
00:19:49,966 --> 00:19:52,300
GIVES YOU A CHANCE TO KEEP YOUR

745
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:52,900
HOUSE, WHICH YOU MIGHT NEED TO

746
00:19:52,966 --> 00:19:54,009
LIVE IN, AND YOUR CAR, WHICH YOU

747
00:19:54,033 --> 00:19:56,600
MIGHT NEED TO WORK.

748
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,433
BUT FOR MANY, MANY MORE, CHAPTER

749
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,533
13... DESPITE COSTING THREE

750
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,266
TIMES AS MUCH IN THE LONG TERM

751
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,766
...CAN ACTUALLY SEEM LIKE THE

752
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,133
BETTER FINANCIAL OPTION WHEN

753
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,766
YOU FILE.

754
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,433
BECAUSE CHAPTER 7 GENERALLY

755
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,700
REQUIRES YOU TO PAY LAWYERS UP

756
00:20:08,766 --> 00:20:09,566
FRONT.

757
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:11,833
WHEREAS CHAPTER 13 CAN BE

758
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,942
DIFFERENT, AS LAW FIRMS CAN BE

759
00:20:12,966 --> 00:20:15,266
EAGER TO POINT OUT.

760
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,633
IS DEBT CONSTANTLY ON YOUR

761
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,766
MIND?

762
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:18,942
ARE YOU LOOKING TO GET A FRESH

763
00:20:18,966 --> 00:20:20,300
START FINANCIALLY?

764
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:21,533
THEN CALL THE BANKRUPTCY

765
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,500
ATTORNEYS AT WOOTTON & WOOTTON.

766
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:24,100
WE EVEN OFFER A NO MONEY DOWN

767
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,200
CHAPTER 13 PLAN.

768
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,833
OKAY, FIRST, GET THE

769
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,300
FUCK OUT OF MY VOID, WOOTTON!

770
00:20:29,366 --> 00:20:31,466
I KNOW I DON'T TECHNICALLY OWN

771
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:32,100
THE CONCEPT OF SAD, WHITE

772
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:32,966
EMPTINESS... JARED LETO'S GOT

773
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:34,700
THE MARKET COVERED ON THAT ONE.

774
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,300
BUT I WILL BE DAMNED IF I LET

775
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:37,409
THIS ADULT WHO LOOKS LIKE HE

776
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:38,576
JUST MADE A WISH TO BE BIG STEAL

777
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,500
MY WHOLE VIBE.

778
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:42,933
BUT THE POINT IS, IF YOU'RE

779
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,866
ALREADY IN A BAD SPOT WITH YOUR

780
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:46,133
FINANCES... WHICH YOU PROBABLY

781
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,500
ARE, IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING

782
00:20:47,566 --> 00:20:48,933
BANKRUPTCY... "NO MONEY UP

783
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,166
FRONT" MIGHT NOT JUST SOUND

784
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:53,033
GOOD, IT MIGHT BE YOUR ONLY

785
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,566
OPTION.

786
00:20:53,633 --> 00:20:55,400
THE WORRY IS THAT SOME LAWYERS

787
00:20:55,466 --> 00:20:56,766
GUIDE THEIR CLIENTS TO

788
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,600
THE MORE EXPENSIVE CHAPTER 13,

789
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,033
WHEN THEY'D ACTUALLY BE FAR

790
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,500
BETTER SERVED WITH CHAPTER 7.

791
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:03,066
AND IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

792
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:10,000
AMERICA, IT WON'T SURPRISE YOU

793
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:12,400
THAT WOULD RESEARCHERS RAN AN

794
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:17,233
ACADEMIC STUDY, THEY FOUND THAT

795
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,833
ATTORNEYS WERE MORE LIKELY TO

796
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,566
OFFER A CHAPTER CHAPTER 13

797
00:21:21,633 --> 00:21:23,100
BANKRUPTCY TO BLACK PEOPLE

798
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,700
RATHER THAN WHITE PEOPLE.

799
00:21:24,766 --> 00:21:26,266
PUTTING ASIDE THE QUESTION OF

800
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,433
WHETHER THE RESEARCHERS PLUCKED

801
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,066
REGGIE AND LETICIA FROM THE

802
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:32,209
HOPEFULLY NOT OFFENSIVELY SO

803
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:34,700
BLACK NAMES, THE FINDINGS

804
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:36,500
EXPLAINED THAT THE ODDS OF BLACK

805
00:21:36,566 --> 00:21:37,900
DEBTORS CHOOSING CHAPTER 13

806
00:21:37,966 --> 00:21:38,900
INSTEAD OF CHAPTER 7

807
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:40,009
WERE MORE THAN TWICE AS HIGH AS

808
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:41,500
WHITE DEBTORS WITH A SIMILAR

809
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:45,500
PROFILE.

810
00:21:45,566 --> 00:21:46,233
SO EVEN BANKRUPTCY

811
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:46,833
DISCRIMINATES AGAINST

812
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,133
BLACK PEOPLE.

813
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,733
WHICH IS, COINCIDENTALLY, THE

814
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,300
COVER STORY ON THIS MONTH'S

815
00:21:49,366 --> 00:21:50,166
ISSUE OF "YEAH, NO SHIT"

816
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:50,833
MAGAZINE.

817
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,009
AND THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE

818
00:21:52,033 --> 00:21:53,266
OFTEN PUSHED INTO THE FORM OF

819
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,833
BANKRUPTCY WITH FAR LESS

820
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,076
SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES MEANS THAT

821
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,300
THEY CAN END UP HAVING TO FILE

822
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,933
BANKRUPTCY AGAIN DOWN THE LINE.

823
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,300
AND KNOWING THAT MAKES IT A

824
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:03,200
LITTLE HARD TO SEE FINANCIAL

825
00:22:03,266 --> 00:22:04,666
EXPERTS LIKE SUZE ORMAN BROADLY

826
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:06,033
FRAME REPEATED FILING AS A MORAL

827
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,533
FAILING.

828
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,633
MOST PEOPLE WHO CLAIM

829
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,633
BANKRUPTCY ONCE CLAIM IT TWICE.

830
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,433
SO IF YOU ARE CLAIMING

831
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,100
BANKRUPTCY, YOU HAVE GOT TO

832
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:17,800
LEARN.

833
00:22:17,866 --> 00:22:20,300
BECAUSE IF YOU GET YOURSELF INTO

834
00:22:20,366 --> 00:22:21,633
THAT SITUATION AGAIN, IF YOU GO

835
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,366
OUT AND YOU RACK UP ALL THIS

836
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:25,066
CREDIT CARD DEBT AND ALL THIS

837
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:26,833
STUFF AGAIN, AND YOU HAVE TO

838
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,366
CLAIM BANKRUPTCY AGAIN, THEN I

839
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:32,233
SAY, SHAME ON YOU.

840
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,700
WOW.

841
00:22:35,766 --> 00:22:36,433
SUZE IS OFFERING REPEAT

842
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,633
BANKRUPTCY FILERS THE

843
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,000
"SHAME ON YOU" NORMALLY RESERVED

844
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,766
FOR DOGS WHO PEED ON THE CARPET

845
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:41,766
AND NOSY PHARMACISTS IN

846
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,066
"MAGNOLIA" WHO'VE ASKED

847
00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:43,800
JULIANNE MOORE ONE TOO MANY

848
00:22:43,866 --> 00:22:45,566
QUESTIONS.

849
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:46,900
"I HAVE SICKNESS ALL AROUND ME

850
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,633
AND YOU FUCKING ASK ME MY LIFE?

851
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,842
HAVE YOU SEEN DEATH IN YOUR BED?

852
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:50,933
IN YOUR HOUSE?

853
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,433
WHERE'S YOUR FUCKING DECENCY?

854
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,266
AND THEN I'M ASKED FUCKING

855
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,700
QUESTIONS.

856
00:22:54,766 --> 00:22:55,833
WHAT'S WRONG?

857
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,466
YOU SUCK MY DICK.

858
00:22:57,533 --> 00:22:59,433
THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG.

859
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,833
AND YOU, YOU FUCKING CALL ME

860
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,366
"LADY?"

861
00:23:01,433 --> 00:23:03,966
SHAME ON YOU.

862
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:07,566
SHAME ON YOU!"

863
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:09,033
BUT A FEW THINGS.

864
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,166
FIRST, EXPERTS SAY ORMAN'S CLAIM

865
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:12,513
THAT MOST BANKRUPTCY FILERS FILE

866
00:23:12,566 --> 00:23:14,566
TWICE IS JUST WRONG.

867
00:23:14,633 --> 00:23:16,333
BUT MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY,

868
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,866
EVEN THOSE WHO DO END UP FILING

869
00:23:17,933 --> 00:23:19,633
A SECOND TIME, OFTEN DO SO

870
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,633
DUE TO FACTORS THAT HAVE NOTHING

871
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,600
TO DO WITH RECKLESSNESS... LIKE,

872
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,900
FOR INSTANCE, GETTING A

873
00:23:24,966 --> 00:23:26,200
CHAPTER 13 BANKRUPTCY THAT

874
00:23:26,266 --> 00:23:27,833
WASN'T RIGHT FOR THEM.

875
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,140
AND THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT

876
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,733
CAN SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT THE HELP

877
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,000
BANKRUPTCY CAN PROVIDE...

878
00:23:32,066 --> 00:23:33,400
BECAUSE THERE ARE WHOLE

879
00:23:33,466 --> 00:23:35,300
CATEGORIES OF "NON-DISCHARGEABLE

880
00:23:35,366 --> 00:23:37,000
DEBTS"... DEBTS THAT EVEN

881
00:23:37,066 --> 00:23:38,966
BANKRUPTCY CAN'T GET RID OF.

882
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:40,300
YOU TYPICALLY CAN'T WIPE OUT

883
00:23:40,366 --> 00:23:41,966
DEBT FROM CRIMINAL PENALTIES,

884
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:44,166
TAXES, OR CHILD SUPPORT THROUGH

885
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:46,700
BANKRUPTCY... AND THERE'S

886
00:23:46,766 --> 00:23:47,933
ANOTHER, MASSIVE CATEGORY, AS

887
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,400
THIS WOMAN LEARNED.

888
00:23:48,466 --> 00:23:50,133
31-YEAR-OLD RADMILLA

889
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,833
SULEYMANOVA GRADUATED WITH A

890
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,666
MASTERS FROM NEW YORK UNIVERSITY

891
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:54,733
IN 2008 DURING THE DEPTHS OF THE

892
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,133
GREAT RECESSION.

893
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,400
JOBLESS, SHE QUICKLY DEFAULTED

894
00:24:03,466 --> 00:24:04,633
ON HER $80,000 STUDENT LOAN

895
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,266
BILL.

896
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,100
OH, WELL, I'LL JUST FILE FOR

897
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:07,933
BANKRUPTCY LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IS

898
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,466
DOING, HA-HA-HA.

899
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:09,566
AND THEN YOU REALIZE...

900
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:10,400
NO.

901
00:24:10,466 --> 00:24:11,576
THE ONLY WAY TO GET AWAY FROM

902
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,200
YOUR STUDENT LOAN DEBT IS TO

903
00:24:12,266 --> 00:24:12,900
DIE.

904
00:24:12,966 --> 00:24:17,033
YEAH.

905
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:17,800
AND TO COMMUNICATE JUST HOW BAD

906
00:24:17,866 --> 00:24:19,833
STUDENT LOAN DEBT IS AS A

907
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,400
GENERATIONAL DEAD WEIGHT ON

908
00:24:20,466 --> 00:24:21,733
MILLENNIALS, I GUARANTEE YOU

909
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,766
ANYONE WITH STUDENT LOANS

910
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:25,666
WATCHING THIS HEARD "$80,000

911
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:27,200
AND THOUGHT "OH, I

912
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:28,366
DUNNO, I'VE HEARD WORSE."

913
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:29,300
BECAUSE, YEAH, SHE COULD HAVE

914
00:24:29,366 --> 00:24:31,033
BOUGHT THIS ENTIRE THREE

915
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,600
BEDROOM, TWO BATHROOM HOUSE

916
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:33,906
IN INDIANAPOLIS, BUT WHO REALLY

917
00:24:33,966 --> 00:24:35,633
NEEDS A PLACE TO LIVE WHEN YOU

918
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,966
HAVE A FRAMED 8.5 X 11 PIECE OF

919
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:38,042
PAPER WITH YOUR NAME ON IT?

920
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:39,200
THAT CAN, JUST LIKE A HOUSE,

921
00:24:39,266 --> 00:24:42,533
KEEP YOU SAFE FROM THE RAIN.

922
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,800
AND IF ALL THAT WEREN'T BAD

923
00:24:43,866 --> 00:24:45,233
ENOUGH, OUR CURRENT SYSTEM ADDS

924
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,066
INSULT TO INJURY THROUGH

925
00:24:47,133 --> 00:24:48,366
MANDATORY CREDIT COUNSELING

926
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:49,366
COURSES.

927
00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:50,666
WHICH CAN BE EXACTLY AS

928
00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:52,466
PATRONIZING AS THEY SOUND.

929
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,333
EVEN BANKRUPTCY JUDGES HAVE

930
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
CALLED THEM "INANE" AND "A

931
00:24:56,466 --> 00:24:57,800
PROCEDURAL HURDLE WITHOUT VALUE

932
00:24:57,866 --> 00:24:59,900
OR CONSEQUENCE."

933
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:01,466
WITH ONE EVEN NOTING A COURSE

934
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,566
REFERRED PARTICIPANTS "TO THE

935
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:04,776
LOCAL LIBRARY FOR RESOURCES ON

936
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,533
BANKRUPTCY."

937
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,566
AND RECOMMENDED THEY "SEEK A JOB

938
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:09,066
MAKING HIGHER WAGES" AND I'M

939
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:10,933
SURE THEY'D NEVER THOUGHT OF

940
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,500
DOING THAT BEFORE IT WAS

941
00:25:13,566 --> 00:25:14,400
VERY CLEVERLY POINTED OUT TO

942
00:25:14,466 --> 00:25:14,933
THEM.

943
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,266
AND IF IT SEEMS THESE COURSES

944
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:17,966
MAY HAVE LIMITED VALUE,

945
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:20,233
ONE WE FOUND ONLINE EVEN SEEMED

946
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:20,866
TO RELUCTANTLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

947
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:21,733
FACT.

948
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,066
YOUR ATTORNEY MAY HAVE GONE

949
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:24,600
OVER YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION

950
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:25,833
WITH YOU IN THEIR OFFICE

951
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,833
ALREADY.

952
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,766
PERHAPS THEY EXPLAINED WHY

953
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,073
CREDIT COUNSELING WILL NOT WORK

954
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,300
FOR YOU.

955
00:25:30,366 --> 00:25:31,766
MANY DEBTORS THEREFORE BELIEVE

956
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:32,873
THAT THIS MANDATORY CREDIT

957
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,200
COUNSELING EXERCISE IS

958
00:25:36,266 --> 00:25:36,466
POINTLESS.

959
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:37,900
WE HOPE INSTEAD YOU TAKE A MORE

960
00:25:37,966 --> 00:25:38,866
POSITIVE VIEW OF THIS MANDATORY

961
00:25:38,933 --> 00:25:40,166
COURSE.

962
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:40,733
OH, YOU HOPE SO,

963
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,800
DO YOU?

964
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:42,633
THAT'S BASICALLY AN ADMISSION

965
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,400
THAT IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

966
00:25:44,466 --> 00:25:46,366
ALTHOUGH, QUICK QUESTION, WHY IS

967
00:25:46,433 --> 00:25:47,966
THE ATTORNEY THERE CARTOON ME?

968
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:48,566
HE'S WEARING MY GLASSES.

969
00:25:48,633 --> 00:25:49,666
HE HAS MY BANGS.

970
00:25:49,733 --> 00:25:51,333
HE'S NEGGING AN UNWILLING

971
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,966
CIVILIAN WHILE WAVING AROUND

972
00:25:53,033 --> 00:25:56,233
A BORING AMOUNT OF PAPERWORK.

973
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,066
THE GUY IS MORE ME THAN I AM.

974
00:25:57,133 --> 00:25:57,766
BUT WHILE AT BEST, AN

975
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:58,900
OBJECTIVELY HUNKY CARTOON

976
00:25:58,966 --> 00:26:00,633
LECTURING YOU ON YOUR FINANCES

977
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,233
IS ANNOYING... AT WORST, IT CAN

978
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:03,700
BE ACTIVELY INSULTING.

979
00:26:03,766 --> 00:26:05,133
BECAUSE THE ASSUMPTION IN THESE

980
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,133
COURSES IS THAT YOU'RE IN THIS

981
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,666
POSITION DUE TO RECKLESS

982
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,233
PERSONAL BEHAVIOR.

983
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,833
BUT IMAGINE HOW THAT ARGUMENT

984
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,466
FEELS IF YOU... LIKE THIS WOMAN

985
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:13,233
...WENT BANKRUPT AFTER HAVING TO

986
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,766
LEAVE YOUR JOB TO TAKE CARE OF

987
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:16,100
YOUR SON, WHO DIED FROM

988
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:18,266
CYSTIC FIBROSIS.

989
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:19,600
IN SEPTEMBER, WE SAT DOWN

990
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:22,433
TO TAKE THE CREDIT COUNSELING

991
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,200
COURSE AND IT WAS SORT OF A SLAP

992
00:26:23,266 --> 00:26:25,066
IN THE FACE, HONESTLY.

993
00:26:25,133 --> 00:26:25,766
AND WE HAVE NOT YET FINISHED

994
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:27,433
THAT COURSE.

995
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,233
WE LOGGED OFF AND NEEDED TO WALK

996
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,233
AWAY FROM IT FOR A LITTLE

997
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:36,033
WHILE.

998
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,700
AND WE'LL

999
00:26:36,766 --> 00:26:38,466
NEED TO DO IT AGAIN AFTER WE

1000
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:39,066
ACTUALLY GO THROUGH THE FILING

1001
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:39,833
PROCESS AND MEET WITH THE JUDGE.

1002
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,533
IT'S A REQUIREMENT AFTER YOU

1003
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,533
FILE, AS WELL, SO THAT YOU CAN,

1004
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,133
I GUESS, GET AN IDEA OF HOW TO

1005
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,733
NOT DO THE SAME THING AGAIN IN

1006
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,533
THE FUTURE.

1007
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,033
SO.

1008
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,900
WHICH IS AN INCREDIBLY HURTFUL

1009
00:26:48,966 --> 00:26:49,800
IDEA THAT I'M NOT LOOKING

1010
00:26:49,866 --> 00:26:51,133
FORWARD TO.

1011
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,933
NO, OF COURSE YOU'RE

1012
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
NOT.

1013
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:54,400
BECAUSE HAVING A COURSE SUGGEST

1014
00:26:54,466 --> 00:26:55,733
THERE'S A WAY NOT TO HAVE YOUR

1015
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,876
CHILD DIE AGAIN IN THE FUTURE IS

1016
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,933
A FUCKING INSULT.

1017
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,466
AND IT'S TERRIBLE THAT SHE NOT

1018
00:27:00,533 --> 00:27:01,333
ONLY HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT,

1019
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,433
BUT THEN HAD TO REHASH IT IN THE

1020
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,800
SENATE IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET THAT

1021
00:27:04,866 --> 00:27:07,033
REQUIREMENT CHANGED... WHICH, BY

1022
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,833
THE WAY, IT WASN'T.

1023
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,766
AND THE TRUTH IS, SO MUCH OF

1024
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,009
WHAT IS WRONG WITH OUR CURRENT

1025
00:27:11,033 --> 00:27:13,100
BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM STEMS FROM

1026
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:14,666
THAT 2005 LAW THAT I MENTIONED

1027
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:15,333
EARLIER.

1028
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
EXPANDING THE

1029
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:17,133
NON-DISCHARGEABILITY OF

1030
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,733
STUDENT LOAN DEBT?

1031
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,700
THAT WAS IN THERE.

1032
00:27:18,766 --> 00:27:21,100
THE MANDATORY CREDIT COUNSELING

1033
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:21,333
CLASSES?

1034
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,400
THAT WAS IN THERE, TOO.

1035
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:23,933
THE LAW ALSO MADE BANKRUPTCY

1036
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,176
HARDER TO COMPLETE, ADDING OVER

1037
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
A DOZEN WAYS SOMEONE COULD MAKE

1038
00:27:27,266 --> 00:27:29,133
A TECHNICAL ERROR AND BE

1039
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,400
DISMISSED.

1040
00:27:29,466 --> 00:27:30,266
IT WAS A HUGE WIN FOR

1041
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:31,833
THE CREDIT CARD COMPANIES.

1042
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,909
AND FOR ALL THE ASSURANCES

1043
00:27:32,933 --> 00:27:34,600
FROM GRASSLEY AND OTHERS THAT IT

1044
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:35,842
WOULD TARGET HIGH-INCOME PEOPLE

1045
00:27:35,866 --> 00:27:39,566
ABUSING THE SYSTEM WITHOUT

1046
00:27:39,633 --> 00:27:40,776
HURTING THOSE OF LESSER MEANS,

1047
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,333
AFTER IT PASSED, BANKRUPTCY

1048
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,600
FILINGS DROPPED

1049
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:43,900
DISPROPORTIONATELY IN POORER

1050
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:45,166
NEIGHBORHOODS, WITH FILINGS

1051
00:27:45,233 --> 00:27:46,966
THERE DECREASING 32% MORE THAN

1052
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:49,000
IN RICH ONES.

1053
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:50,700
SHOWING THAT AS ALWAYS, WHEN

1054
00:27:50,766 --> 00:27:52,266
THINGS ARE DESIGNED TO BECOME

1055
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:52,866
HARDER FOR EVERYONE, FOR THE

1056
00:27:52,933 --> 00:27:54,009
RICH, THEY JUST BECOME A BIT

1057
00:27:54,033 --> 00:27:54,800
MORE EXPENSIVE, AND FOR THE

1058
00:27:54,866 --> 00:27:55,666
POOR, THEY BECOME BASICALLY

1059
00:27:55,733 --> 00:27:57,266
IMPOSSIBLE.

1060
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:59,000
SO WHAT CAN WE DO HERE?

1061
00:27:59,066 --> 00:28:00,433
WELL, IDEALLY, THE PEOPLE

1062
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,033
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT 2005 LAW

1063
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,466
WOUL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR

1064
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:04,733
SYSTEM BADLY NEEDS FIXING.

1065
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,066
AND COINCIDENTALLY, ONE OF THE

1066
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:07,766
MOST PROMINENT BACKERS OF THAT

1067
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:09,300
LAW IS ACTUALLY THE FUCKING

1068
00:28:09,366 --> 00:28:11,733
PRESIDENT NOW.

1069
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,966
JOE BIDEN IS FROM DELAWARE,

1070
00:28:13,033 --> 00:28:14,333
HOME TO SOME OF THE BIGGEST

1071
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,900
CREDIT CARD COMPANIES.

1072
00:28:15,966 --> 00:28:17,233
AND HIS SUPPORT WAS CRUCIAL

1073
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,533
IN GETTING THE 2005 LAW PASSED.

1074
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,800
AND IT'S NOT LIKE HE WASN'T

1075
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,633
WARNED IT COULD LEAD TO TROUBLE

1076
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,166
...WHEN IT WAS BEING DEBATED,

1077
00:28:24,233 --> 00:28:25,333
ELIZABETH WARREN... THEN A

1078
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,576
HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR STUDYING

1079
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,066
BANKRUPTCY... TESTIFIED ABOUT

1080
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:29,000
HOW MEDICAL DEBT RUINS PEOPLE'S

1081
00:28:29,066 --> 00:28:32,200
LIVES, AND THIS BILL COULD

1082
00:28:32,266 --> 00:28:32,900
SIGNIFICANTLY HINDER THEIR ONE

1083
00:28:32,966 --> 00:28:33,566
REMAINING CHANCE TO GET OUT FROM

1084
00:28:33,633 --> 00:28:35,466
UNDERNEATH IT.

1085
00:28:35,533 --> 00:28:37,100
AND JOE BIDEN KEPT SHIFTING

1086
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:38,442
FOCUS BACK TO THE POOR CREDITORS

1087
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:41,300
WHO WOULDN'T GET THEIR MONEY.

1088
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:43,233
UNTIL WE FIX THE BROKEN

1089
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,500
HEALTH CARE FINANCE SYSTEM...

1090
00:28:44,566 --> 00:28:45,566
RIGHT.

1091
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,233
THOSE FAMILIES HAVE TO TURN

1092
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,433
SOMEWHERE AND THAT MEANS NOW

1093
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,566
THEY TURN AS A LAST-DITCH EFFORT

1094
00:28:52,633 --> 00:28:53,833
TO THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS.

1095
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,900
RIGHT.

1096
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,000
AND THAT MEANS THEY TURN TO

1097
00:28:57,066 --> 00:28:59,800
ASKING THE PEOPLE THAT THEY

1098
00:28:59,866 --> 00:29:01,633
BORROWED MONEY FROM TO PAY FOR

1099
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,600
THEIR HEALTH CARE COSTS, RIGHT?

1100
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:05,842
WE'RE GONNA ASK THE GAS COMPANY,

1101
00:29:05,866 --> 00:29:08,700
THE DRUG STORE, THE AUTOMOBILE

1102
00:29:08,766 --> 00:29:10,466
DEALER TO PAY FOR THE BROKEN

1103
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:12,900
SYSTEM?

1104
00:29:12,966 --> 00:29:15,733
OKAY, BUT THAT'S NOT

1105
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,233
REALLY HOW THIS WORKS.

1106
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,309
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE LIVING IN

1107
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,733
SOME SMALL TOWN IN THE 1920s,

1108
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,300
RACKING UP DEBTS TO

1109
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:21,233
THE CORNER STORE FOR GROCERIES,

1110
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,833
THE BUTCHER SHOP FOR MEAT, AND

1111
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,300
THE LOCAL PHARMACY FOR

1112
00:29:23,366 --> 00:29:24,133
COUGH DROPS LACED WITH

1113
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,333
WEAPONS-GRADE COCAINE.

1114
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:25,966
NO.

1115
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:28,166
WE'RE LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE

1116
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:28,866
MEDICAL DEBT IS OUT OF CONTROL,

1117
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,233
AND PEOPLE HAVE ENVELOPES RAMMED

1118
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,533
THROUGH THEIR DOOR EVERY DAY,

1119
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,866
SCREAMING THEY'RE PRE-APPROVED

1120
00:29:32,933 --> 00:29:33,933
FOR A CREDIT CARD.

1121
00:29:33,966 --> 00:29:34,400
OH, LOOK!

1122
00:29:34,466 --> 00:29:36,800
THIS ONE HAS SNOOPY ON IT!

1123
00:29:36,866 --> 00:29:38,733
NOW THE GOOD NEWS IS,

1124
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,266
ELIZABETH WARREN HAS PROPOSED

1125
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:41,376
THE "CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY REFORM

1126
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,133
ACT" WHICH WOULD COMPLETELY

1127
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,209
OVERHAUL OUR BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM,

1128
00:29:45,233 --> 00:29:47,066
IT WOULD ELIMINATE EXCESSIVE

1129
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:48,242
PAPERWORK NEEDED FOR FILING,

1130
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:49,476
THEREBY LOWERING ATTORNEY COSTS.

1131
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,700
IT'D MAKE STUDENT LOAN DEBT

1132
00:29:50,766 --> 00:29:52,833
DISCHARGEABLE, IT'D GET RID OF

1133
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,133
THE REQUIREMENT FOR A CREDIT

1134
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,966
COUNSELING COURSE, AND IT'D

1135
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:57,400
COMBINE CHAPTERS 7 AND 13 INTO A

1136
00:29:57,466 --> 00:29:59,400
NEW, MORE FLEXIBLE CHAPTER 10.

1137
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:00,709
IT'S A COMBINATION THAT WOULD BE

1138
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:02,366
AN IMPROVEMENT... SORT OF LIKE

1139
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:03,442
BURGER KING'S CHICKEN FRIES,

1140
00:30:03,466 --> 00:30:04,542
A LITTLE BIT CHICKEN, A LITTLE

1141
00:30:04,566 --> 00:30:05,266
BIT FRIES, ALL IN A BOX THAT

1142
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:07,033
LOOKS LIKE I ASKED MY KIDS TO

1143
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,300
DRAW ME FROM MEMORY.

1144
00:30:08,366 --> 00:30:09,700
AND WHILE BIDEN HAS BROADLY

1145
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,366
EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR WARREN'S

1146
00:30:11,433 --> 00:30:12,866
REFORMS, THE FACT IS, THE BILL

1147
00:30:12,933 --> 00:30:15,000
IS UNLIKELY TO PASS IN ITS

1148
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:16,366
ENTIRETY... IT'D CURRENTLY NEED

1149
00:30:16,433 --> 00:30:18,000
TEN REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE

1150
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,300
TO GET ON BOARD BECAUSE

1151
00:30:19,366 --> 00:30:21,000
DEMOCRATS LIKE JOE MANCHIN AND

1152
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:22,366
KYRSTEN SINEMA ARE STILL IN A

1153
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:23,633
DEATH CULT OVER THE FILIBUSTER

1154
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:24,400
FOR SOME REASON.

1155
00:30:24,466 --> 00:30:25,766
BUT THE FACT IS, SOMETHING BIG

1156
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:28,400
NEEDS TO HAPPEN HERE.

1157
00:30:28,466 --> 00:30:29,866
BECAUSE WE BADLY NEED TO GET OUR

1158
00:30:29,933 --> 00:30:32,166
BROKEN BANKRUPTCY SYSTEM WORKING

1159
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:32,800
AGAIN FOR PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY

1160
00:30:32,866 --> 00:30:34,866
NEED A LIFELINE.

1161
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,600
AND MEANWHILE, WHILE WE WAIT FOR

1162
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:37,809
CONGRESS TO ACT, THE VERY LEAST

1163
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:39,433
WE CAN DO IS OFFER AN

1164
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,433
ALTERNATIVE CREDIT COUNSELING

1165
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,000
COURSE THAT ISN'T QUITE SO

1166
00:30:41,066 --> 00:30:46,100
INSULTING.

1167
00:30:47,366 --> 00:30:48,766
HELLO THERE.

1168
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:49,909
I'M THE CARTOON STEAM ES WALK.

1169
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:51,466
IF YOU ARE WATCHING THIS VIDEO,

00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:52,933
CHANCES ARE YOU HAVE HIT HARD

1171
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,833
TIMES.

1172
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,300
MAYBE YOUR HUSBAND WAS PANCAKE

1173
00:30:55,366 --> 00:30:57,300
BY AN UNMARKED CARGO MAN OR

1174
00:30:57,366 --> 00:30:58,666
MAYBE YOU LOST YOUR JOB DUE TO

1175
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:01,133
THE CORONAVIRUS AND THAT

1176
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,600
FATEFUL DAY IN 2019 WHEN ONE BAT

1177
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:05,700
FUCKED THAT OTHER BAT.

1178
00:31:05,766 --> 00:31:07,133
EITHER WAY, YOU ARE SADDLED WITH

1179
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,200
DEBT RIGHT NOW AND YOU'RE

1180
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,666
LOOKING FOR A FRESH START.

1181
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:10,800
THANKFULLY, YOU HAVE FOUND

1182
00:31:10,866 --> 00:31:11,800
BANKRUPTCY.

1183
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:13,033
LESS THAT IS YOUR DEBT'S

1184
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,933
STUDENT LOANS, IN WHICH CASE,

1185
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,900
YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT FAKING

1186
00:31:15,966 --> 00:31:17,333
YOUR OWN DEATH BECAUSE ODDS ARE

1187
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,366
YOU ARE AS FUCKED AS THIS BAT.

1188
00:31:19,433 --> 00:31:21,100
UNDER CURRENT THINKERS WHO ARE,

1189
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:23,933
YOU ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE

1190
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,500
THIS CREDIT COUNSELING COURSE.

1191
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:26,066
AND THE KEY THING I'M HERE TO

1192
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:28,366
TELL YOU IF THEY ARE TWO MAIN

1193
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:30,100
KINDS OF PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY,

1194
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:31,433
CHAPTER 7, THAT'S THE THING YOU

1195
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,300
THINK OF BANKRUPTCY WERE

1196
00:31:32,366 --> 00:31:33,409
TYPICALLY MOST OF YOUR DEBTS CAN

1197
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,266
BE DISCHARGED IN CHAPTER 13,

1198
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:36,900
WHICH YOU MIGHT ASSUME WORKS

1199
00:31:36,966 --> 00:31:38,206
SIMILARLY, THERE ANYONE WHO HAS

1200
00:31:38,266 --> 00:31:39,833
BEEN THROUGH IT KNOWS THAT IT

1201
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,333
DOESN'T.

1202
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,533
AND IF ALL THIS SEEMS NEEDLESSLY

1203
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,066
CONFUSING, IT'S BECAUSE IT IS.

1204
00:31:44,133 --> 00:31:45,700
THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY

1205
00:31:45,766 --> 00:31:48,133
DESIGNED TO BE SO DISCOURAGING

1206
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,933
THAT EVENTUALLY YOU SAY FUCK IT

1207
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,100
AND GIVE UP.

1208
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,000
ARE YOU OKAY?

1209
00:31:53,066 --> 00:31:54,366
SO INSTEAD OF WATCHING A

1210
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:55,542
CONDESCENDING SERIES OF VIDEOS

1211
00:31:55,566 --> 00:31:57,100
ABOUT HOW TO MAKE A BUDGET, WHY

1212
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:59,300
DON'T WE BOTH MAKE BETTER USE OF

1213
00:31:59,366 --> 00:32:00,600
THIS TIME AND ENJOY THIS VIDEO

1214
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:04,300

1215
00:32:04,366 --> 00:32:05,133
RACCOONS INDIVIDUAL HOT DOGS?

1216
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,066
YES!

1217
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,466
YES!

1218
00:32:08,533 --> 00:32:08,800
YES!

1219
00:32:08,866 --> 00:32:11,066
LOOK, FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY

1220
00:32:11,133 --> 00:32:13,066
WILL NEVER BE AS ENJOYABLE AS A

1221
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:13,866
RACCOON EATING A HOTDOG.

1222
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:15,800
BUT AT THE VERY LEAST, IT SHOULD

1223
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:18,966
BE THAT SIMPLE.

1224
00:32:19,033 --> 00:32:20,033
BYE.

1225
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,666
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

1226
00:32:24,733 --> 00:32:25,842
