A FRENZY OVER GAMESTOP,

21
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,266

REALLY INTO SEA SHANTIES.

23
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:53,833
IT'S BEEN A WEIRD TIME.

ATTORNEYS MOUNTED A DEFENSE

00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,066

WEREN'T TRYING VERY HARD,

45
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,300

46
00:01:21,366 --> 00:01:22,833
DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TO.

56
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:36,200

57
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:38,133

75
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,333
OF JUST HOW DEEP TRUMPISM RUNS

76
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,433
IN THEIR PARTY.

77
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,933
BUT NOT JUST AT THE

78
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,533
NATIONAL LEVEL.

79
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,766
IN MANY WAYS, AT THE STATE

80
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:09,633
LEVEL, IT'S EVEN WORSE.

81
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,533
MORE THAN A DOZEN STATE

82
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,566
LEGISLATORS ACTUALLY

83
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:12,533
PARTICIPATED IN THE

84
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,666
"STOP THE STEAL" RALLY

85
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:14,566
PRECEDING THE RIOTS, AND ONE OF

86
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:16,033
THEM EVEN MADE IT INSIDE.

89

AND CHIPMUNK FRAT PLEDGE,

90
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:23,800
WAS EVENTUALLY ARRESTED.

91
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:25,366
AND WHILE HE MAINTAINED THAT

92
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:26,766
HE WAS ONLY IN THE CAPITOL AS AN

93
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,633
INDEPENDENT MEMBER OF THE MEDIA

94
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,533
TO FILM HISTORY, THE HISTORY

95
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,333
HE FILMED TOLD A VERY DIFFERENT

96
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,300
STORY.

97
00:02:32,366 --> 00:02:33,366

DERRICK EVANS IS IN THE CAPITOL!

104
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:44,266
THAT IS AWFUL.

105
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,966
FROM THE FACT THAT A STATE

106
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:46,900
LAWMAKER PARTICIPATED

107
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,333
IN A DEADLY INSURRECTION,

108
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,600
TO THE FACT HE WAS STUPID ENOUGH

109
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,600
TO BROADCAST HIMSELF DOING IT,

110
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:51,700
TO HIM EXCITEDLY TALKING ABOUT

111
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:53,233
HIMSELF IN THE THIRD PERSON LIKE

112
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,266
SOME KIND OF ALT-RIGHT ELMO.

113
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,700
AND WHILE EVANS HAS SINCE

114
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:57,866
RESIGNED, HE'S JUST THE TIP OF

115
00:02:57,933 --> 00:02:59,500
THE ICEBERG WHEN IT COMES TO

116
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:00,733
EXTREME BEHAVIOR IN STATE

117
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,666
REPUBLICAN PARTIES.

118
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:04,100
OREGON'S STATE G.O.P. PUT OUT

119
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,966
A STATEMENT CLAIMING THE RIOTS

120
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:07,100
WERE A "FALSE FLAG OPERATION

121
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:07,700
DESIGNED TO DISCREDIT

122
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:09,333
PRESIDENT TRUMP."

123

124
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,333
REPUBLICAN WAS CAUGHT ON TAPE

125
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,200

126
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:14,933

TALKING ABOUT THE DEADLY

130
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:20,300
JANUARY 6TH CAPITOL RIOTS,

131
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,633
SAYING IT WAS PREARRANGED, AND

132
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,466
THAT IT WASN'T TRUMP'S PEOPLE.

133
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:24,100
>> THAT'S BEEN A HOAX FROM DAY

134
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,800
ONE.

135
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:27,500
THAT WAS ALL PREARRANGED.

136
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:28,733
THAT WAS ALL ARRANGED BY

137
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,533
SOMEBODY THAT WAS FUNDING IT.

138
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,666
>> John: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU

139
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,633
TALKING ABOUT, SHIRKEY?

140
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,733
TO THE EXTENT JANUARY 6TH WAS

141
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,700
"PREARRANGED" BY ANYONE,

142
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:38,166
IT WAS CLEARLY BY TRUMP, AS HE

143
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:40,066
REPEATEDLY TWEETED THINGS

144
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:41,233
LIKE, "BIG PROTEST IN D.C.

145
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,400
ON JANUARY 6TH...

146
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:43,500
BE THERE, WILL BE WILD!"

147
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:45,266
WHICH, TO BE FAIR, WAS ONE OF

148
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,366
THOSE OCCASIONS WHERE HE TURNED

149
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:48,466
OUT TO BE COMPLETELY RIGHT.

150
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:50,333
AND I KNOW THAT MAN LOOKS LIKE

151
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,233
HE ANSWERS THE QUESTION,

152
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,400
"WHAT IF STEVE MARTIN WAS

153
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,033
AWFUL?," BUT THE FACT IS,

154
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,300
HE'S THE MAJORITY LEADER OF

155
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:56,800
THE MICHIGAN SENATE.

156
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:58,533
HE HAS REAL POWER.

157
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,800
THEN THERE'S ARIZONA, WHERE

158
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:01,833
THEIR REPUBLICAN PARTY CENSURED

159
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,300
THREE PEOPLE -- INCLUDING THEIR

160
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:04,233
GOVERNOR AND CINDY McCAIN --

161
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,533
FOR NOT SUFFICIENTLY SUPPORTING

162
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,900
TRUMP.

163
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:08,533
AND IN EARLY DECEMBER, DID THIS:

164
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,033
>> USING THE "STOP THE STEAL"

165
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,866
SLOGAN, A TRUMP SUPPORTER

166
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:14,066
WRITES, "I AM WILLING TO GIVE

167
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,533
MY LIFE FOR THIS FIGHT."

168
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,933
THE STATE REPUBLICAN PARTY

169
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,400
RESPONDS, "HE IS.

170
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,166
ARE YOU?"

171
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:20,733
THEN THE OFFICIAL PARTY DOUBLES

172
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,166
DOWN, TWEETING OVERNIGHT A CLIP

173
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:23,500
FROM "RAMBO" AND THE QUOTE,

174
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:25,066
"THIS IS WHAT WE DO, WHO WE ARE.

175
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:26,200
LIVE FOR NOTHING, OR DIE FOR

176
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,633
SOMETHING."

177
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,533
>> John: OKAY, ASIDE FROM BEING

178
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,666
COMPLETELY TERRIFYING, THAT

179
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:33,733
QUOTE IS FROM THE 2008 "RAMBO"

180
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,600
MOVIE -- AT THAT POINT, THE

181
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:36,433
WORST "RAMBO" MOVIE, UNTIL THEY

182
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,633
MADE ANOTHER ONE.

183
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,933
I'M JUST SAYING, IF YOU

184
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,100
ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO QUOTE

185
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,433
STALLONE, THERE ARE SO MANY

186
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,433
BETTER OPTIONS.

187
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,733
THEY COULD HAVE GONE WITH,

188
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,000

HAVE FUN!

402
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:04,033
I'M PROBABLY GOING TO

REGRET THAT.

404
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,433
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU MIGHT BE

405
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,100
THINKING RIGHT NOW:

406
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,166
"JOHN, SHUT THE FUCK UP!

407
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:12,100
NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR ANY MORE

408
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:12,966
ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS!"

409
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:13,933
AND I GET THAT!

410
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,100
WHICH IS WHY WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY

411
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:15,933
GOING TO TALK ABOUT

412
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,800
THE CURRENT PANDEMIC TONIGHT.

413
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,266
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT

414
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:18,733
THE NEXT ONE INSTEAD.

415
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,766
WHICH, I KNOW, SOUNDS EVEN LESS

416
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:20,866
APPEALING, BUT, LOOK, WE ARE THE

417
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:22,066
SHOW WE ARE.

418
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:23,433
IF YOU WANT TO SEE A BRITISH

419
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,233
PERSON DO SOMETHING HOT OR

420
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,000
INTERESTING, GO WATCH

421
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:26,766
"BRIDGERTON."

422
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:27,566
LOTTA JIZZING IN BLANKETS

423
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:31,033
ON THAT SHOW.

424
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,900
HOWEVER MUCH YOU EXPECT,

425
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:33,433
THERE'S SIGNIFICANTLY MORE.

426
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,633
BUT NOW MIGHT ALSO BE THE MOST

427
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,700
IMPORTANT TIME TO TALK ABOUT

428
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:36,933
THIS.

429
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,366
BECAUSE SCIENTISTS ATTEMPTED

430
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:39,633
TO WARN US ABOUT "THE NEXT

431
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,766
PANDEMIC" LONG BEFORE THE

432
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:41,833
CURRENT ONE HIT,

433
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,766
AND WE DIDN'T REALLY LISTEN.

434
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,600
IN FACT, 17 YEARS AGO, JUST

435
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,366
AFTER THE SARS EPIDEMIC WAS

436
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:48,966
CONTAINED, A LEADING SCIENTIST

437
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:49,833
WAS ON "60 MINUTES," SOUNDING

438
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,033
A CHILLING WARNING.

439
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,900
>> WHAT WORRIES ME THE MOST IS

440
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:53,266
THAT WE'RE GONNA MISS THE

441
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,466
NEXT EMERGING DISEASE, THAT

442
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:55,300
WE'RE GONNA SUDDENLY FIND

443
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:56,466
A SARS VIRUS THAT MOVES FROM

444
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:58,133
ONE PART OF THE PLANET TO

445
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,366
ANOTHER, WIPING OUT PEOPLE

446
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:00,333
AS IT MOVES ALONG.

447
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,633
>> SOMETHING MORE LETHAL THAN

448
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,133
SARS IS WHAT WORRIES YOU.

449
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,866
>> THAT'S SOMETHING TO BE

450
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:05,366
KEEPING YOU AWAKE AT NIGHT.

451
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:07,100
>> John: UH, YEAH, IT IS.

452
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,933
BECAUSE THAT IS A HAUNTINGLY

453
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,966
SPOT-ON PREDICTION THERE.

454
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:10,833
I KIND OF WANTED HIM TO

455
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,166
CONTINUE.

456
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:13,033
"JUST SPITBALLING HERE,

457
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,933
WHAT IF THAT GUY FROM

458
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,700
"THE APPRENTICE" BECOMES

459
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:15,500
PRESIDENT?

460
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:16,800
OR SOME LONELY GOON AT HARVARD

461
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:18,133
INVENTS A WEBSITE THAT DESTROYS

462
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,833
THE FABRIC OF SOCIETY AS WE KNOW

463
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,766
IT?

464
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,466
THAT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP YOU

465
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:22,800
AWAKE AT NIGHT, TOO!"

466
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:23,966
LOOK, I KNOW THIS CURRENT

467
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:26,266
CORONAVIRUS MIGHT FEEL LIKE A

468
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,433
ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME NIGHTMARE,

469
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,566
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY PART

470
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:29,966
OF A GLOBAL TREND, BECAUSE

471
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:31,366
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF INFECTIOUS

472
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:33,000
DISEASE OUTBREAKS HAS INCREASED

473
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:34,600
SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE 1980.

474
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,866
WE'VE SEEN OUTBREAKS LIKE SARS

475
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:38,633
IN 2003, H1N1 IN 2009, A SERIES

476
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,600
OF EBOLA OUTBREAKS, MOST NOTABLY

477
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,166
IN 2014, MERS IN 2015,

478
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:44,733
ZIKA THAT SAME YEAR,

479
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,033
AND, OF COURSE, THE CURRENT

480
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,300
VIRUS WE'RE ALL ENDURING, WHICH

481
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:48,333
IS THE MAIN REASON I'M CURRENTLY

482
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,600
SPEAKING TO YOU COMPLETELY ALONE

483
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:50,633
FROM WHAT LOOKS LIKE THE

484
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,233
PILLSBURY DOUGHBOY'S ASS CRACK.

485
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,500
AND THE TRUTH IS, IF WE'RE NOT

486
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:55,800
VERY CAREFUL, THE NEXT PANDEMIC

487
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:57,633
COULD WELL BE EVEN WORSE.

488
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,066
>> THERE ARE VIRUSES CURRENTLY

489
00:11:59,133 --> 00:12:02,266
CIRCULATING IN WILDLIFE.

490
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,033
THEY ESSENTIALLY KILL 60 TO 70%

491
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,666
OF THE PEOPLE THEY INFECT.

492
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:07,200
>> THE VIRUS THAT CAUSES

493
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:09,233
COVID-19 MIGHT JUST BE A DRESS

494
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,800
REHEARSAL FOR THE BIG ONE LATER?

495
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:13,533
>> THIS IS NOT, BY ANY STRETCH

496
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,233
OF THE IMAGINATION, THE WORST

497
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,300
MOTHER NATURE HAS TO OFFER US.

498
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:18,300
>> John: WELL, THAT DOESN'T

499
00:12:18,366 --> 00:12:19,133
SOUND GREAT.

500
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,400
AND LOOK, I KNOW THIS ISN'T THE

501
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:21,833
MOST IMPORTANT THING THERE, BUT:

502
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,966
WHAT IS IT WITH DISEASE EXPERTS

503
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:23,833
AND PREDICTING UPCOMING

504
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,866
PANDEMICS WHILE ON BOATS?

505
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:26,566
THAT'S A TERRIBLE USE OF A BOAT.

506
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:27,466
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE CHILL.

507
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:28,966
READ THE BOAT RULES.

508
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:29,833
ONE: THE CAPTAIN'S ALWAYS

509
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,666
RIGHT.

510
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:31,800
TWO: WE ONLY FISH ON DAYS THAT

511
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:32,966
END IN "Y."

512
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:34,633
AND THREE: NO GRIM TIDINGS OF

513
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,566
THE VIRAL APOCALYPSE.

514
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:36,900
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

515
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:38,733
THAT'S A BOAT FOUL, DR. BUMMER.

516
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,566
>> BOAT FOUL!

517
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:44,966
>> John: INDEED.

518
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:46,500
AND WHILE YOU WOULD HOPE THAT

519
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:47,733
THE LAST YEAR WOULD BE A WAKE-UP

520
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,766
CALL TO EVERYONE, THOSE WHO

521
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:49,700
STUDY PANDEMICS ARE SKEPTICAL

522
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:50,600
THAT WE'VE LEARNED NEARLY

523
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:51,533
ENOUGH.

524
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,766
>> I THINK WHAT I'VE SEEN IN

525
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,300
HISTORY OF LOOKING AT THESE

526
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:54,866
PATHOGENS OVER TIME IS THAT

527
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:55,800
WE USUALLY GO RIGHT BACK TO

528
00:12:55,866 --> 00:12:56,866
BUSINESS AS USUAL AS SOON AS

529
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:57,600
THE THING ENDS, AS SOON AS WE

530
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:58,966
HAVE A DRUG, AS SOON AS WE HAVE

531
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:00,733
A VACCINE, AS SOON AS WE CAN

532
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,333
KIND OF GHETTOIZE THESE DISEASES

533
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,500
INTO MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS.

534
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:06,533
WE DON'T REALLY DO THE

535
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,233
FUNDAMENTAL SOCIAL CHANGE

536
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,300
THAT WE COULD DO.

537
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:10,400
>> John: EXACTLY.

538
00:13:10,466 --> 00:13:11,566
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS EVERY

539
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:12,900
CHANCE THAT AFTER ALL THIS IS

540
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:15,500
OVER, WE'LL END UP TREATING

541
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:16,400
THE CORONAVIRUS LIKE A REALLY

542
00:13:16,466 --> 00:13:17,833
BAD FART AT THANKSGIVING.

543
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,766
THAT IS, WAITING PATIENTLY FOR

544
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:19,966
IT TO DISSIPATE SO WE CAN

545
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,366
NEVER SPEAK OF IT AGAIN AND

546
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,066
COLLECTIVELY PRETEND THAT

547
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:25,600
IT DIDN'T JUST KILL GRANDMA.

548
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,600
SO GIVEN ALL OF THAT, TONIGHT,

549
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:27,966
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE NEXT

550
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:30,233
PANDEMIC -- SPECIFICALLY,

551
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:30,833
WHERE NEW INFECTIOUS DISEASES

552
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,433
COME FROM, WHY THEY'RE ON THE

553
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,233
RISE, AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO

554
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,000
LIMIT THEM.

555
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:34,100
AND LET'S START WITH HOW WE GOT

556
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,166
INTO OUR CURRENT SITUATION.

557
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,000
THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS CAUSED

558
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:39,500
BY A NOVEL CORONAVIRUS CALLED

559
00:13:39,566 --> 00:13:41,366
"SARS-COV-2," WHICH ORIGINATED

560
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:42,866
IN ANIMALS BEFORE JUMPING TO

561
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:43,933
HUMANS.

562
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,600
AND THAT IS BY NO MEANS UNUSUAL.

563
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,466
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT UP TO 75%

564
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:49,700
OF NEW OR EMERGING INFECTIOUS

565
00:13:49,766 --> 00:13:50,466
DISEASES COME FROM ANIMALS.

566
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:51,366
THEY'RE CALLED

567
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:53,033
"ZOONOTIC DISEASES" OR

568
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,333
"ZOONOSES."

569
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,600
NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH

570
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:56,966
"ZOO NOSE," WHICH, FOR THE

571
00:13:57,033 --> 00:13:58,400
RECORD, IS A VERY HURTFUL THING

572
00:13:58,466 --> 00:13:59,966
TO CALL A TEENAGER WHO'S ALREADY

573
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:01,866
GOT ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH.

574
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:03,800
AND COVID IS BY NO MEANS THE

575
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:05,033
ONLY ZOONOTIC DISEASE OUT THERE.

576
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,500
THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED

577
00:14:06,566 --> 00:14:07,800
1.7 MILLION CURRENTLY

578
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:09,666
UNDISCOVERED VIRUSES IN MAMMALS

579
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:10,933
AND BIRDS, OF WHICH BETWEEN

580
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,466
SIX AND 800,000 COULD HAVE

581
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:15,266
THE ABILITY TO INFECT HUMANS.

582
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,233
AND LOTS OF ANIMAL SPECIES ARE

583
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,666
HOSTS FOR ZOONOTIC DISEASE.

584
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:19,833
BIRDS AND PIGS CAN HARBOR

585
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,033
INFLUENZA.

586
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,533
CHIMPANZEES WERE THE BRIDGE OF

587
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,333
HIV TO HUMANS, AND TURTLES CAN

588
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,833
CARRY SALMONELLA, WHICH IS

589
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,366
SOMETHING WE ALL REMEMBER FROM

590
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:28,466
ONE OF THE DARKEST EPISODES OF

591
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:31,400
THE NINJA TURTLES CARTOON.

592
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:36,100
THAT'S RIGHT: ONE OF THEIR

593
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,566
TURTLE POWERS SEEMED TO BE

594
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:40,500
INADVERTENTLY KILLING

595
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:41,733
APRIL O'NEIL.

596
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,900
ONE OF THE BIGGEST VECTORS

597
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:43,533
FOR TRANSMITTING VIRUSES IS,

598
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,433
FAMOUSLY, BATS.

599
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,533
THEY'VE BEEN LINKED TO EBOLA,

600
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,233
THE DEADLY NIPAH VIRUS, AND

601
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,166
COVID-19.

602
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:47,900
IN FACT, HERE IS THAT EERILY

603
00:14:47,966 --> 00:14:49,100
PRESCIENT EXPERT THAT YOU SAW

604
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,333
EARLIER WARNING OF THE DANGERS

605
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,433
OF A POPULAR BAT-BASED TOURIST

606
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,366
ATTRACTION BACK IN 2016.

607
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:54,433
>> THE BATS HERE IN THIS CAVE

608
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,333
ARE THE SAME BATS THAT CARRY

609
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
SARS VIRUS.

610
00:14:57,466 --> 00:14:59,266
WHEN THEY'RE UP THERE, THEY

611
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,300
URINATE AND DEFECATE RIGHT ON

612
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,533
TOP OF THE TOURISTS THAT ARE

613
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,433
WALKING THROUGH.

614
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,633
AND ALL YOU HAVE GOT TO DO IS BE

615
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,233
THAT ONE PERSON TO BREATHE IN AT

616
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,533
THE WRONG TIME, AND SUDDENLY YOU

617
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,366
HAVE BEEN INFECTED WITH A --

618
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:10,766
WITH A VIRUS THAT IS NOT ONLY

619
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,766
POTENTIALLY LETHAL TO PEOPLE, IT

620
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,600
COULD CAUSE A FUTURE PANDEMIC.

621
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,233
>> John: THAT'S HORRIBLE -- AND

622
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,600
NOT JUST THE DISEASE PART.

623
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,566
JUST THE VERY CONCEPT OF THIS

624
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:22,000
WALK-IN BAT TOILET BEING

625
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:23,633
A TOURIST DESTINATION.

626
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,733
THAT MIGHT BE THE WORST TOURIST

627
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,266
ATTRACTION SINCE DISNEYLAND PUT

628
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,366
JOHNNY DEPP ANIMATRONICS IN THE

629
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:28,966
"PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN" RIDE.

630
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:30,100
C'MON, DISNEY, THERE'S KIDS

631
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,166
HERE!

632
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:32,866
THEY'RE HERE TO WATCH SOME JOLLY

633
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,500
NAUTICAL RAPISTS AND THIEVES,

634
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:35,766
NOT A WEIRD, SAD MILLIONAIRE

635
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,700
DOING A B-PLUS KEITH RICHARDS.

636
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:40,266
NOW THERE ARE REASONS THAT BATS

637
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,000
ARE SUCH GOOD HOSTS FOR DISEASE.

638
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:43,833
THEY CAN FLY, SO THEY CAN COVER

639
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,166
LARGE DISTANCES.

640
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:46,200
THEY'VE DEVELOPED SPECIALIZED

641
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:47,466
IMMUNE SYSTEMS THAT DON'T

642
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:48,533
OVERREACT TO INFECTIONS, WHICH

643
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,166
KEEPS THEM FROM FALLING ILL.

644
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:51,466
AND THEY ARE INSANELY PLENTIFUL.

645
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,466
NEARLY A QUARTER OF THE WORLD'S

646
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:56,633
MAMMAL SPECIES ARE BATS.

647
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,166
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "GREAT,

648
00:15:58,233 --> 00:15:59,800
THEN THERE'S AN EASY FIX HERE:

649
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:04,833
LET'S SIMPLY KILL ALL BATS,"

650
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,533
THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT A GREAT

651
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,500
IDEA, FOR MULTIPLE REASONS.

652
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:08,166
NOT ONLY ARE THEY CRUCIAL

653
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,100
ELEMENTS OF OUR ECOSYSTEM,

654
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:09,866
THEY'RE ALSO WAY CUTER THAN

655
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:11,133
THEY'RE OFTEN GIVEN CREDIT FOR!

656
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,333
JUST LOOK AT THIS FUZZY LITTLE

657
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,533
GOOBER EATING A BANANA!

658
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,633
LOOK AT THIS ONE SCARFING DOWN

659
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,766
A WATERMELON!

660
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,166
AND JUST LOOK AT THIS LITTLE GUY

661
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:20,200
TRYING TO ABSOLUTELY HOUSE

662
00:16:20,266 --> 00:16:20,900
A SINGLE GRAPE.

663
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:22,000
LOOK AT HIM GO!

664
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:23,300
WHO'S STRUGGLING WITH A GRAPE?

665
00:16:23,366 --> 00:16:23,900
YOU ARE!

666
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:25,300
YOU'RE STRUGGLING WITH A GRAPE,

667
00:16:25,366 --> 00:16:27,633
YOU LITTLE GOTH MOUSE!

668
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,066
ALSO, IT IS IMPORTANT TO

669
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:31,766
REMEMBER THAT THE FACT THAT WE

670
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:32,966
MAY'VE CAUGHT COVID FROM BATS

671
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:33,966
ISN'T SO MUCH THEIR FAULT AS IT

672
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:35,933
IS OURS.

673
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,666
BECAUSE OUTBREAKS OF BAT VIRUSES

674
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:39,333
DON'T TEND TO COME FROM THEM

675
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,666
SEEKING US OUT; THEY USUALLY

676
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,766
HAPPEN WHEN A HUMAN TAKES A BAT

677
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:43,966
SOMEWHERE IT'D NEVER GO ON ITS

678
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:45,966
OWN OR INTRUDES ON ITS HOME.

679
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:47,933
AND THAT ACTUALLY BRINGS US TO

680
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,166
THE FIRST BIG THING WE'RE DOING

681
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:50,966
THAT MAY WELL BRING ABOUT THE

682
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:52,033
NEXT PANDEMIC.

683
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,633
AND THAT IS ERASING THE BUFFER

684
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,633
BETWEEN CIVILIZATION AND

685
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,600
WILDLIFE.

686
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,166
SCIENTISTS HAVE REPEATEDLY

687
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:58,366
WARNED US ABOUT THE DANGERS OF

688
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:00,000
DEFORESTATION, URBANIZATION,

689
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:01,366
MINING, AND GENERALLY

690
00:17:01,433 --> 00:17:03,133
SUPPLANTING NATURAL HABITATS,

691
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,300
WHICH HAS BEEN FAR MORE

692
00:17:04,366 --> 00:17:07,500
EXTENSIVE THAN YOU MIGHT THINK.

693
00:17:07,566 --> 00:17:09,700
>> MANY PEOPLE IMAGINE THERE'S

694
00:17:09,766 --> 00:17:10,433
THIS UNTOUCHED WILDERNESS

695
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,600
BECAUSE THEY SEE IT ON THEIR

696
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,766
TV SCREENS, BUT THE REALITY IS,

697
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:14,766
THERE'S REALLY NOT A LOT OF WILD

698
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,400
LEFT THERE.

699
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:18,833
>> WE'VE ALREADY LOST NEARLY

700
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,800
90% OF THE WETLANDS AROUND

701
00:17:19,866 --> 00:17:21,700
THE WORLD.

702
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:23,066
WE'VE TRANSFORMED THE FORESTS,

703
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:25,233
OUR GRASSLANDS.

704
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,266
WE'VE CONVERTED 75% OF THE LAND

705
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,700
THAT IS NOT COVERED BY ICE.

706
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:31,633
>> THREE QUARTERS OF THE

707
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,233
TERRESTRIAL SURFACE HAS BEEN

708
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,266
CHANGED.

709
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:33,833
A LOT OF IT JUST TO FEED ONE

710
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,000
SPECIES.

711
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:36,233
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

712
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,166
WE'VE CHANGED THREE-QUARTERS OF

713
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:39,933
THE EARTH'S LAND AREAS!

714
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,533
AND WHILE SOME OF THAT WAS

715
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,133
NECESSARY, WE HAVE ALSO CHANGED

716
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,733
A LOT TO BUILD DUMB, POINTLESS

717
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,366
SHIT THAT NO ONE REALLY WANTS OR

718
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,066
NEEDS, LIKE PAINTBALL COURSES,

719
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,566
OR NOVELTY T-SHIRT SHOPS, OR

720
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:51,900
SALT LAKE CITY.

721
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:53,300
AND THAT VANISHING BOUNDARY

722
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:54,866
HAS BROUGHT INCREASED RISK.

723
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:56,433
OVER 30% OF NEW AND EMERGING

724
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,600
DISEASES ARE LINKED TO

725
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,900
DEFORESTATION AND LAND USE

726
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:00,000
CHANGE.

727
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:01,300
TAKE THE AMAZON.

728
00:18:01,366 --> 00:18:02,466
STUDIES HAVE DOCUMENTED THAT

729
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:03,966
CLEARING PATCHES OF FOREST

730
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:05,500
APPEARS TO CREATE THE IDEAL

731
00:18:05,566 --> 00:18:07,066
HABITAT ALONG FOREST EDGES FOR

732
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:08,500
THE TYPE OF MOSQUITO THAT'S

733
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:09,900
THE MOST COMMON TRANSMITTER OF

734
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:11,000
MALARIA THERE.

735
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:13,300
OR TAKE WEST AFRICA.

736
00:18:13,366 --> 00:18:15,400
THE FIRST VICTIM OF 2014'S

737
00:18:15,466 --> 00:18:16,466
EBOLA OUTBREAK WAS A YOUNG BOY

738
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:17,833
WHO'D BEEN SEEN PLAYING NEAR

739
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,633
A TREE INFESTED WITH BATS BEFORE

740
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,600
HE GOT SICK.

741
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,700
HE LIVED IN A SMALL VILLAGE

742
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:23,600
WHERE MUCH OF THE SURROUNDING

743
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,366
FOREST HAD BEEN DESTROYED BY

744
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:25,766
FOREIGN MINING AND TIMBER

745
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:26,500
OPERATIONS.

746
00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:29,900
AND EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT

747
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:30,833
THAT IS WHAT BROUGHT THE BATS

748
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,166
INTO HIS VILLAGE.

749
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:35,866
AND BEFORE YOU THINK THIS IS

750
00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:38,700
JUST AN OVERSEAS PROBLEM, IT IS

751
00:18:38,766 --> 00:18:39,633
WORTH REMEMBERING THAT ONE OF

752
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,600
THE CLEAREST EXAMPLES OF HABITAT

753
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:42,233
DESTRUCTION FUELING AN EMERGING

754
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:42,866
DISEASE HAPPENED RIGHT HERE IN

755
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:43,866
THE U.S., WHERE LYME DISEASE WAS

756
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:45,400
FIRST IDENTIFIED IN CONNECTICUT

757
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:46,200
IN THE 1980s, AND WAS DRIVEN BY

758
00:18:46,266 --> 00:18:49,133
SUBURBANIZATION.

759
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,966
>> WHAT WE'VE FOUND IS THAT THE

760
00:18:51,033 --> 00:18:52,433
PROBABILITY THAT A TICK IS GOING

761
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,400
TO ACQUIRE AN INFECTION WHEN IT

762
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,433
FEEDS ON A WHITE FOOTED MOUSE IS

763
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,333
ABOUT 90%.

764
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,300
AS WE FRAGMENT THE LANDSCAPE,

765
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:02,233
WE CHOP UP CONTINUOUS FOREST

766
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:02,766
INTO LITTLE BITS, WE LOSE

767
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:03,500
SPECIES.

768
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:06,800
THEY DISAPPEAR.

769
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:08,300
ONE OF THE LAST CREATURES IS

770
00:19:08,366 --> 00:19:11,233
THE WHITE FOOTED MOUSE.

771
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,766
SO AS WE REDUCE DIVERSITY, WE'RE

772
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,400
LOSING THE SPECIES THAT PROTECT

773
00:19:14,466 --> 00:19:15,500
US AND FAVORING THE ONES THAT

774
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:15,900
MAKE US SICK.

775
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:17,500
>> John: RIGHT.

776
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:18,700
WE FRAGMENTED THE LANDSCAPE

777
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:20,566
AND THAT DROVE OUT PREDATORS,

778
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:21,600
LEAVING CREATURES LIKE

779
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,100
WHITE-FOOTED MICE, WHO ARE THE

780
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,666
MAIN CULPRITS WHEN IT COMES TO

781
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:26,000
LYME DISEASE TRANSMISSION.

782
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:28,766
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS:

783
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,300
FUCK WHITE-FOOTED MICE.

784
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:31,700
THEY CAN GO FUCK THEMSELVES.

785
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:33,266
UNLIKE, OF COURSE, RATS, WHO CAN

786
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,866
AND SHOULD GO FUCK EACH OTHER.

787
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:36,700
BUT IT'S NOT JUST US MOVING

788
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:37,733
CLOSER TO ANIMALS.

789
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,233
IT'S THAT, MORE AND MORE,

790
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,533
WE'RE BRINGING WILD ANIMALS INTO

791
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,066
CONTACT WITH US THROUGH THE

792
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:43,266
WILDLIFE TRADE.

793
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,766
NOW SOMETIMES THAT TAKES THE

794
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,133
FORM OF EXOTIC PETS, WHETHER

795
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,966
IT'S WHEN PARIS HILTON GOT A

796
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:50,166
KINKAJOU NAMED BABYLUV, OR THIS

797
00:19:50,233 --> 00:19:51,900
RANDOM BRITISH MAN'S EXTREMELY

798
00:19:51,966 --> 00:19:53,333
ILL-ADVISED ROOMMATE.

799
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,733
>> AN ORDINARY STREET IN KENT

800
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,633
AND A SUBURBAN SEMI WITH A

801
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,566
NORMAL CONSERVATORY.

802
00:19:58,633 --> 00:20:00,300
BUT IT'S LICENSED FOR SOMETHING

803
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,133
FAR FROM NORMAL.

804
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,433
IS A CROCODILE A SUITABLE PET TO

805
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,433
HAVE IN A SUBURBAN HOUSE LIKE

806
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,066
THIS?

807
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:11,533
>> HE'S VERY MELLOW.

808
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,433
HE'S NOT THE SAME ANIMAL

809
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,333
HE WOULD BE BECAUSE HE'S -- HE'S

810
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,366
ADJUSTED, SHALL WE SAY, TO HUMAN

811
00:20:14,433 --> 00:20:14,833
LIFE.

812
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,833
HAVING SOMETHING THAT NO ONE

813
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,966
ELSE HAS GOT IS -- IS AN

814
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:17,733
INTERESTING THING.

815
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,866
>> John: I MEAN, SURE.

816
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:21,566
I GUESS THAT'S TRUE.

817
00:20:21,633 --> 00:20:23,133
BUT EVEN IF YOU INSIST ON OWNING

818
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,900
A WILD ANIMAL -- WHICH YOU

819
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:26,266
REALLY SHOULDN'T -- WHY A

820
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:26,733
CROCODILE?

821
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,266
THEY'RE NOT REMOTELY CUDDLY.

822
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,400
YOU'RE BASICALLY FLOODING YOUR

823
00:20:29,466 --> 00:20:31,000
BROOM CLOSET TO MAKE ROOM

824
00:20:31,066 --> 00:20:32,666
FOR A CARNIVOROUS SURFBOARD.

825
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,800
THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE HUMAN USE

826
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,866
FOR ANY CROCODILE OR ALLIGATOR

827
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:38,566
IS AS THE STAR OF THE INTERNET'S

828
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:40,066
GREATEST MUSIC VIDEO:

829
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:41,833
♪ IT'S FLAT FUCK FRIDAY ♪

830
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,166
♪ YOU FUCKIN' LOSERS ♪

831
00:20:46,233 --> 00:20:51,100
♪ IT'S FLAT FUCK FRIDAY ♪

832
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:55,300
>> John: EXCELLENT.

833
00:20:55,366 --> 00:20:56,900
THAT IS EXCELLENT.

834
00:20:56,966 --> 00:21:00,133
THAT SONG IS CATCHIER THAN SARS

835
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,166
IN A GOOD WAY.

836
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:02,200
THE POINT IS, EXOTIC PET

837
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:02,900
OWNERSHIP HAS CAUSED REAL

838
00:21:02,966 --> 00:21:03,733
PROBLEMS.

839
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
IN 2003, 47 PEOPLE ACROSS SIX

840
00:21:04,866 --> 00:21:05,966
STATES CAUGHT MONKEYPOX --

841
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:06,833
WHICH HAD NEVER INFECTED HUMANS

842
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,966
OUTSIDE OF AFRICA -- AFTER

843
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,533
HAVING CONTACT WITH INFECTED

844
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,733
PRAIRIE DOGS PURCHASED AS PETS.

845
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,433
AND IN 2006, PARIS HILTON HAD TO

846
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,633
GO TO THE HOSPITAL AFTER HER

847
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,866
KINKAJOU BIT HER.

848
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:18,400
AND IT'S HARD TO SAY WHICH WAS

849
00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:19,966
WORSE: A U.S. MONKEYPOX

850
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:21,100
OUTBREAK, OR BABYLUV'S SHOCKING

851
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,066
BETRAYAL.

852
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:25,400
ET TU, KINKAJOU?

853
00:21:25,466 --> 00:21:26,733
BUT PERHAPS THE MOST FAMOUS WAY

854
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,900
WILD ANIMALS CAN SPREAD DISEASE

855
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:29,266
TO HUMANS IS WHEN THEY'RE SOLD

856
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,266
FOR CONSUMPTION.

857
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:34,100
AND THE PHRASE YOU'RE PROBABLY

858
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,333
ALREADY THINKING OF RIGHT NOW IS

859
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,266
"WET MARKETS."

860
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,166
LIKE THE ONE IN WUHAN, WHICH MAY

861
00:21:37,233 --> 00:21:38,233
WELL HAVE BEEN THE BREAKOUT SITE

862
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,966
OF COVID-19.

863
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:41,333
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW: THE TERM

864
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,700
"WET MARKET" IS USED INCREDIBLY

865
00:21:42,766 --> 00:21:44,966
BROADLY AND OFTEN INCORRECTLY.

866
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:45,800
MANY WET MARKETS ARE ESSENTIALLY

867
00:21:45,866 --> 00:21:48,000
JUST PLACES WHERE FRESH MEAT,

868
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:49,066
SEAFOOD, AND PRODUCE ARE SOLD,

869
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:51,066
NOT UNLIKE A FARMER'S MARKET.

870
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:52,066
AND THEY CAN BE KEY SOURCES OF

871
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:54,366
FRESH, AFFORDABLE FOOD AROUND

872
00:21:54,433 --> 00:21:55,600
THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY IN

873
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,066
DEVELOPING AREAS WHERE THERE

874
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:58,166
ISN'T, Y'KNOW, A TRADER JOE'S

875
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,166
THREE BLOCKS AWAY.

876
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:02,200
HOWEVER, SOME OF THOSE MARKETS

877
00:22:02,266 --> 00:22:03,533
DO SELL WILDLIFE LIKE BATS AND

878
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,666
SNAKES AND CONDITIONS IN SOME OF

879
00:22:05,733 --> 00:22:06,800
THOSE WILDLIFE MARKETS CAN BE

880
00:22:06,866 --> 00:22:10,166
IDEAL FOR DISEASE TRANSMISSION.

881
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:13,900
>> SO HERE IN CAGES RIGHT NEXT

882
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:15,666
TO EACH OTHER, WE'VE GOT ADULT

883
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:17,100
RACCOONS NEXT TO CAPYBARA,

884
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,833
WHICH IS FROM SOUTH AMERICA.

885
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,633
THOSE ARE FROM NORTH AMERICA.

886
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,566
CAGES RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER.

887
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:21,166
THIS IS THE BIGGEST RODENT IN

888
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:28,800
THE WORLD.

889
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:31,333
AND ON TOP OF HERE, I THINK --

890
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:31,833
MARMOSETS ON TOP OF THE

891
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,866
CAPYBARA.

892
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:34,633
>> WHAT WE JUST SAW HERE IS LIKE

893
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,733
A BIOLOGICAL WARFARE LAB.

894
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,433
ANY ONE ANIMAL CAN TRANSMIT

895
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,866
A PATHOGEN TO ANOTHER, SOMEBODY

896
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:41,300
BUYS IT, HANDLES IT, TAKES IT

897
00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:43,133
HOME AS A PET OR EATS IT.

898
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,333
BOOM.

899
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,633
WE HAVE ANOTHER PANDEMIC.

900
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,433
>> John: RIGHT.

901
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,600
WHEN WILD ANIMALS FROM DIFFERENT

902
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:50,233
PARTS OF THE WORLD ARE HELD IN

903
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,266
CLOSE PROXIMITY, WITH WEAKENED

904
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,833
IMMUNE SYSTEMS DUE TO STRESS,

905
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,700
PATHOGENS CAN EASILY JUMP FROM

906
00:22:54,766 --> 00:22:55,900
ONE SPECIES TO ANOTHER, AND

907
00:22:55,966 --> 00:22:57,500
POTENTIALLY TO HUMANS.

908
00:22:57,566 --> 00:22:59,266
WHICH SHOULD, AT THE VERY LEAST,

909
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,233
MAKE YOU SERIOUSLY RETHINK YOUR

910
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,000
ISLAND IN "ANIMAL CROSSING."

911
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:05,300
YOU HONESTLY THINK IT'S STILL

912
00:23:05,366 --> 00:23:06,400
A GOOD IDEA TO LIVE IN CLOSE

913
00:23:06,466 --> 00:23:06,966
PROXIMITY WITH A RACCOON,

914
00:23:07,033 --> 00:23:08,100
AN OWL, A GORILLA, A TIGER,

915
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,633
A SHEEP, A KOALA, AN OCTOPUS,

916
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,800
A HAMSTER, A PENGUIN, A RHINO,

917
00:23:12,866 --> 00:23:14,500
AND A CHICKEN NAMED GOOSE, ALL

918
00:23:14,566 --> 00:23:15,366
OF WHOM TRAVELED THERE FROM

919
00:23:15,433 --> 00:23:17,066
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD?

920
00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:18,866
THAT'S NOT AN ISLAND PARADISE --

921
00:23:18,933 --> 00:23:19,500
IT'S A DISEASE CHERNOBYL WAITING

922
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:22,100
TO HAPPEN.

923
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,900
SHUT THAT SHIT DOWN!

924
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:25,366
AND LISTEN, I KNOW IT DOESN'T

925
00:23:25,433 --> 00:23:26,866
SOUND GREAT WHENEVER SOMEONE,

926
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:27,866
PARTICULARLY WITH THIS ACCENT,

927
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:29,600
STARTS TUT-TUTTING ABOUT HOW

928
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:30,700
PEOPLE IN OTHER COUNTRIES FEED

929
00:23:30,766 --> 00:23:32,566
THEMSELVES AND MAKE A LIVING.

930
00:23:32,633 --> 00:23:34,666
AND FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, BEFORE

931
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:36,933
WE GO TELL EVERYONE ELSE WHAT TO

932
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,666
DO, WE MIGHT WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE

933
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:39,600
THAT OUR TRACK RECORD ON MIXING

934
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:42,533
ANIMALS ISN'T GREAT, EITHER.

935
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,500
ONE EXPERT THAT WE SPOKE TO SAID

936
00:23:43,566 --> 00:23:44,366
A MAJOR CONCERN OF THEIRS IS

937
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:47,200
STATE FAIRS.

938
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:48,066
WHICH DOES KIND OF MAKE SENSE.

939
00:23:48,133 --> 00:23:49,333
STATE AND AGRICULTURAL FAIRS

940
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,133
HAVE BEEN LINKED TO MULTIPLE

941
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,633
DISEASE OUTBREAKS, WITH ONE

942
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,500
IN 2012 THAT INFECTED OVER

943
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,800
300 PEOPLE -- MOSTLY CHILDREN --

944
00:23:57,866 --> 00:23:59,066
ACROSS 10 STATES.

945
00:23:59,133 --> 00:23:59,733
THAT PROBABLY EXPLAINS WHY

946
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,633
FAIRGOERS HAVE BEEN

947
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,633
REPEATEDLY WARNED,

948
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,900
"NO KISSING PIGS!"

949
00:24:02,966 --> 00:24:05,466
AND LOOK, IT'S EASY TO THINK,

950
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:06,700
"COME ON, I'D NEVER KISS A PIG,"

951
00:24:06,766 --> 00:24:07,700
BUT ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

952
00:24:07,766 --> 00:24:08,666
WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?

953
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:09,500
NOT YOU'RE SO SURE NOW, ARE YOU?

954
00:24:09,566 --> 00:24:11,300
WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE RIGHT HERE?

955
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,600
NOW YOU'RE EVEN MORE CONFUSED.

956
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:17,166
AND HOW ABOUT THIS PIG?

957
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:20,166
EXACTLY, I THOUGHT SO.

958
00:24:20,233 --> 00:24:21,733
I'VE GOT GREAT NEWS: THIS HOT

959
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,500
LITTLE PORK CHOP'S BEEN WATCHING

960
00:24:23,566 --> 00:24:24,066
YOU FROM ACROSS THE BAR ALL

961
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:24,633
NIGHT.

962
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,333
IT IS DOWN FOR SOME STUFF.

963
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,300
AND AMERICA'S ACTUALLY

964
00:24:26,366 --> 00:24:27,333
GROUND ZERO FOR ANOTHER

965
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:27,866
DANGEROUS PRACTICE:

966
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:28,700
FACTORY FARMING.

967
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:31,333
IT'S SOMETHING THAT STARTED

968
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,200
HERE, BUT HAS SINCE SKYROCKETED

969
00:24:32,266 --> 00:24:33,266
AROUND THE WORLD, TO THE POINT

970
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,166
THAT FACTORY FARMS NOW SUPPLY

971
00:24:34,233 --> 00:24:37,000
MORE THAN 90% OF MEAT GLOBALLY

972
00:24:37,066 --> 00:24:39,800
AND 99% OF MEAT DOMESTICALLY.

973
00:24:39,866 --> 00:24:41,000
IN FACTORY FARMS, LIVESTOCK ARE

974
00:24:41,066 --> 00:24:43,866
BRED AND CONFINED IN WAYS THAT

975
00:24:43,933 --> 00:24:44,433
CAN ENABLE VIRUSES TO SPREAD

976
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,966
AMONG THEM MUCH MORE EASILY.

977
00:24:46,033 --> 00:24:47,966
>> WE HAVE SEVERAL THOUSAND HOGS

978
00:24:48,033 --> 00:24:49,866
PACKED IN TOGETHER AND THEY'RE

979
00:24:49,933 --> 00:24:50,800
ALL GENETICALLY LARGELY THE

980
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:51,600
SAME.

981
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:53,033
THAT SELECTS FOR THE MOST

982
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,066
VIRULENT PATHOGENS THAT ARE

983
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:55,266
POSSIBLE.

984
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,766
AND SO, IN THE COURSE OF

985
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:57,866
INDUSTRIALIZING LIVESTOCK

986
00:24:57,933 --> 00:24:59,933
PRODUCTION, WE ARE ALSO

987
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,266
INDUSTRIALIZING THE PATHOGENS

988
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,400
THAT CIRCULATE AMONG THEM.

989
00:25:03,466 --> 00:25:04,933
>> John: EXACTLY.

990
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,566
I KNOW IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE,

991
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:07,566
BUT THE COLD, MECHANIZED

992
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:08,766
FACTORIES THAT CRAM ANIMALS

993
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:09,700
TOGETHER BEFORE STAMPING THEIR

994
00:25:09,766 --> 00:25:11,000
FLESH INTO PLASTIC MEAT-MOLDS

995
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:11,933
AND EJECTING THE OUTCOME INTO

996
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,200
SUPERMARKET FREEZER SECTIONS

997
00:25:13,266 --> 00:25:14,366
ACROSS THE NATION MIGHT BE DOING

998
00:25:14,433 --> 00:25:19,833
SOMETHING BAD.

999
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,233
AND WHEN YOU PUT ALL OF THIS

1000
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,133
TOGETHER, IT DOES BEGIN TO SEEM

1001
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,100
LIKE WE'RE ACTIVELY TRYING TO

1002
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:23,900
START PANDEMICS.

1003
00:25:23,966 --> 00:25:25,066
WHICH BRINGS US TO THE OBVIOUS

1004
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:25,766
QUESTION: HOW DO WE STOP DOING

1005
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:27,866
THAT?

1006
00:25:27,933 --> 00:25:29,233
WELL, THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY

1007
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,166
WOULD BE TO CLOSE DOWN ALL

1008
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:30,833
WILDLIFE MARKETS,

1009
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,966
BAN FACTORY FARMING,

1010
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,033
STOP EATING MEAT ALTOGETHER,

1011
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,066
HALT DEFORESTATION, SHUT DOWN

1012
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:37,166
ALL STATE FAIRS, AND DEFINITELY

1013
00:25:37,233 --> 00:25:38,200
TAKE AWAY PARIS HILTON'S

1014
00:25:38,266 --> 00:25:39,133
KINKAJOU.

1015
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,966
BUT OBVIOUSLY, NONE OF THOSE ARE

1016
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:41,300
GOING TO HAPPEN.

1017
00:25:41,366 --> 00:25:42,300
FOR ONE THING, WE KNOW THAT

1018
00:25:42,366 --> 00:25:44,366
KINKAJOU BITES.

1019
00:25:44,433 --> 00:25:46,100
BUT ALSO, DRACONIAN MEASURES ARE

1020
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:47,233
JUST NOT GOING TO WORK HERE.

1021
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,800
FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU ABOLISH

1022
00:25:48,866 --> 00:25:50,933
WILDLIFE MARKETS, THAT COULD

1023
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,400
CAUSE FOOD SCARCITY, AND WOULD

1024
00:25:52,466 --> 00:25:53,666
LIKELY JUST LEAD TO AN EXPLOSION

1025
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:54,400
IN BLACK MARKET TRADE OF

1026
00:25:54,466 --> 00:25:55,266
WILD ANIMALS.

1027
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:57,133
THE REASON WE KNOW THAT IS,

1028
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,500
THAT'S REPORTEDLY WHAT HAPPENED

1029
00:25:58,566 --> 00:25:59,966
WHEN CHINA ATTEMPTED JUST SUCH

1030
00:26:00,033 --> 00:26:01,333
A BAN IN 2003, IN RESPONSE TO

1031
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,566
SARS.

1032
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:03,600
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT WE

1033
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,100
SHOULDN'T TRY TO REDUCE HARMFUL

1034
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:08,133
PRACTICES -- BECAUSE WE SHOULD.

1035
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,133
MANY EXPERTS ARGUE FOR WHAT'S

1036
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,200
CALLED A "ONE HEALTH"

1037
00:26:13,266 --> 00:26:16,966
PERSPECTIVE, WHERE WE

1038
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,566
RECOGNIZE THAT THE HEALTH OF

1039
00:26:19,633 --> 00:26:21,533
HUMANS, ANIMALS, ENVIRONMENT,

1040
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,433
ARE ALL CONNECTED, AND TAKE THAT

1041
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:23,733
INTO ACCOUNT

1042
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,333
WHEN MAKING

1043
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,466
DECISIONS ON EVERYTHING FROM

1044
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:26,033
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS TO

1045
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:26,866
URBAN PLANNING.

1046
00:26:26,933 --> 00:26:28,366
AND THERE ARE GOING TO NEED TO

1047
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:29,100
BE LOTS OF SMALLER SOLUTIONS,

1048
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:30,100
TOO, WHICH WILL LOOK DIFFERENT

1049
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:30,766
EVERYWHERE, BECAUSE, CRUCIALLY,

1050
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:31,733
EVERYWHERE IS DIFFERENT.

1051
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,866
TAKE THAILAND.

1052
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:33,866
THEY'VE HAD SOME REAL SUCCESS

1053
00:26:33,933 --> 00:26:35,166
IN PREVENTING OUTBREAKS THERE BY

1054
00:26:35,233 --> 00:26:36,000
PROVIDING FARMERS WITH

1055
00:26:36,066 --> 00:26:36,833
A PHONE APP TO FLAG ANY PROBLEMS

1056
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,733
THAT THEY SEE.

1057
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:41,133
>> IT'S SIMILAR TO A POOR MAN'S

1058
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,233
INSTAGRAM WITHOUT ANY FILTERS,

1059
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:47,033
THAT HELPS THE VOLUNTEERS IN THE

1060
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,466
VILLAGE TO SUBMIT ABNORMAL

1061
00:26:48,533 --> 00:26:51,266
HEALTH EVENTS IN REAL TIME.

1062
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,233
>> YOU COULDN'T TRAIN EVERYONE

1063
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,133
TO BE A HEALTH EXPERT BUT YOU

1064
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,866
CAN TRAIN EVERYONE TO BE EYES

1065
00:26:55,933 --> 00:27:00,600
AND EARS.

1066
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:01,766
>> John: THAT'S VERY CLEVER.

1067
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:02,666
BECAUSE WITH THAT APP, FARMERS

1068
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:03,466
THERE HAVE A WAY TO SPOT A

1069
00:27:03,533 --> 00:27:04,533
POSSIBLY SICK BIRD THAT COULD

1070
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,933
INFORM BROADER PUBLIC POLICY.

1071
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
WHICH ISN'T JUST EFFECTIVE

1072
00:27:09,066 --> 00:27:11,666
DISEASE PREVENTION, IT WAS ALSO

1073
00:27:11,733 --> 00:27:13,000
INTERESTINGLY THE WORKING TITLE

1074
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:13,766
OF THIS SHOW.

1075
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:14,566
THAT SCHEME HAS BEEN A SUCCESS,

1076
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,533
PARTLY BECAUSE IT PRESERVES

1077
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,700
PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS, AND ALIGNS

1078
00:27:16,766 --> 00:27:18,133
FARMERS' INTERESTS WITH THOSE OF

1079
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,766
THEIR LARGER COMMUNITY.

1080
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:23,733
AND THERE WILL BE THOUSANDS OF

1081
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,500
SMALL IDEAS LIKE THAT, THAT

1082
00:27:24,566 --> 00:27:25,333
COULD END UP MAKING A REAL

1083
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,200
DIFFERENCE.

1084
00:27:26,266 --> 00:27:27,500
AND LOOK, THERE'S NO DENYING

1085
00:27:27,566 --> 00:27:28,666
ALL OF THIS IS GOING TO COST

1086
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:29,166
MONEY.

1087
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:30,300
AND UNFORTUNATELY, SOME

1088
00:27:30,366 --> 00:27:31,233
SCIENTISTS DOUBT OUR APPETITE

1089
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,933
FOR LONG-TERM SPENDING ON THIS.

1090
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,333
JUST LISTEN TO THIS RESEARCHER

1091
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,333
IN BRAZIL MAKE THAT EXACT POINT,

1092
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,066
WHILE TAKING SAMPLES FROM BATS.

1093
00:27:39,133 --> 00:27:40,533
>> IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO

1094
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,733
GET FUNDING FOR OUR KIND OF

1095
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,100
RESEARCH.

1096
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:45,300
NOW, DURING THE PANDEMIC, IT HAS

1097
00:27:45,366 --> 00:27:49,266
BEEN A LITTLE EASIER.

1098
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:52,000
BUT AS SOON AS THE VIRUS CRISIS

1099
00:27:52,066 --> 00:27:53,333
IS OVER, OUR FINANCIAL WORRIES

1100
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,500
WILL RETURN.

1101
00:27:55,566 --> 00:27:57,200
I'M NOT VERY OPTIMISTIC.

1102
00:27:57,266 --> 00:28:01,833
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S NOT GREAT.

1103
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,166
"I'M NOT VERY OPTIMISTIC" ISN'T

1104
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:04,533
WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM

1105
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,300
SOMEONE SCRAPING GERMS OUT OF A

1106
00:28:05,366 --> 00:28:05,766
BAT.

1107
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:07,333
THAT'S A WOMAN WHO LITERALLY

1108
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,100
KNOWS HER SHIT.

1109
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:09,500
SO WE NEED TO SPEND HOWEVER MUCH

1110
00:28:09,566 --> 00:28:10,400
IS NECESSARY TO CHANGE HER

1111
00:28:10,466 --> 00:28:14,766
ANSWER.

1112
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:16,233
AND I'M NOT SAYING THIS WILL BE

1113
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,433
CHEAP; ONE ESTIMATE FOR THE

1114
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,166
COST OF GLOBAL PREVENTION RUNS

1115
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:19,100
BETWEEN $22 AND $31 BILLION

1116
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:19,866
A YEAR.

1117
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:23,400
BUT BEAR IN MIND,

1118
00:28:23,466 --> 00:28:24,766
EVEN IF IT WAS DOUBLE THAT,

1119
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:25,900
THE COST OF COVID-19 IN THE U.S.

1120
00:28:25,966 --> 00:28:26,866
ALONE IS ESTIMATED TO BE OVER

1121
00:28:26,933 --> 00:28:28,300
$16 TRILLION.

1122
00:28:28,366 --> 00:28:29,933
SO, TO PUT IT MILDLY, IT'S

1123
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,366
FUCKING WORTH IT.

1124
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:33,233
AND I KNOW, RIGHT NOW, THAT

1125
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,400
MIGHT SEEM OBVIOUS.

1126
00:28:35,466 --> 00:28:37,033
THE PROBLEM IS, AS WE COME OUT

1127
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,333
THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS PANDEMIC,

1128
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,633
THERE IS A REAL DANGER THAT

1129
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,033
WE'RE GOING TO START TO GET

1130
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:42,333
COMPLACENT.

1131
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,200
SO FOR THE GOOD OF FUTURE

1132
00:28:43,266 --> 00:28:44,233
GENERATIONS -- AND IN ALL

1133
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,666
LIKELIHOOD, US IN A FEW YEARS --

1134
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:48,266
WE REALLY NEED TO REMEMBER THE

1135
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:50,266
WAY WE FEEL RIGHT NOW AND INVEST

1136
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:51,033
ACCORDINGLY.

1137
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,400
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, YOU NEVER

1138
00:28:52,466 --> 00:28:54,566
KNOW WHERE THE NEXT PANDEMIC IS

1139
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:55,066
GOING TO COME FROM.

1140
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,066
>> HEY, Y'ALL!

1141
00:28:56,133 --> 00:28:57,066
REMEMBER ME?

1142
00:28:57,133 --> 00:28:58,533
I'M BACK!

1143
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,066
AND I'M GONNA DO WHAT THE

1144
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:02,066
CORONAVIRUS COULDN'T:

1145
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:03,766
I'M GONNA KILL TOM HANKS!

1146
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,000
>> John: PLEASE DON'T DO THAT,

1147
00:29:05,066 --> 00:29:05,733
VIRUS!

1148
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,266
>> RITA WILSON, TOO!

1149
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:08,433
THEY'RE GONNA CALL ME OLIVER'S

1150
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,200
PLAGUE!

1151
00:29:10,266 --> 00:29:11,466
>> John: I REALLY DON'T WANT YOU

1152
00:29:11,533 --> 00:29:13,000
TO BE CALLED THAT.

1153
00:29:13,066 --> 00:29:13,766
>> OH, I THINK IT'S GOT A RING

1154
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:16,200
TO IT!

1155
00:29:16,266 --> 00:29:18,900
>> John: I ABSOLUTELY DON'T.

1156
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:19,666
THE POINT IS, WE HAVE GOT TO

1157
00:29:19,733 --> 00:29:20,366
REMEMBER THIS FEELING.

1158
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:20,833
IT'S OUR ONLY HOPE.

1159
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,666
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

1160
00:29:22,733 --> 00:29:23,500
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING,

1161
00:29:23,566 --> 00:29:24,133
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK,

1162
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,733
GOOD NIGHT.

1163
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
>> OOH, JOHN, DO YOU THINK A

1164
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:28,600
BUNCH OF CELEBRITIES WILL MAKE

1165
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:29,466
A VIDEO OF THEMSELVES SINGING

1166
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:30,066
"IMAGINE" WHEN I FIRST BREAK

1167
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:34,533
OUT?

1168
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,033
>> John: PROBABLY, TO BE

1169
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,833
HONEST.

1170
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,633
>> I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU!

1171
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,100
>> John: WHAT IS YOUR

1172
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:42,233
SURPRISE?

1173
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,900
>> I CAN SPREAD THROUGH ZOOM!

1174
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:47,500
>> John: HOW CAN YOU SPREAD

1175
00:29:47,566 --> 00:29:47,900
THROUGH ZOOM?

1176
00:29:47,966 --> 00:29:48,966
>> NATURE'S FULL OF MIRACLES!

1177
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:49,833
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

1178
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,566
I'M GOIN' TO DISNEYWORLD!

1179
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:51,633
I'M GONNA GIVE EVERYONE BLOODY
