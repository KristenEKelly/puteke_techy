1
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:28,825
HI THERE!

2
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,200
WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL

3
00:00:30,266 --> 00:00:31,566
TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK VOID,

4
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:32,466
NOW, SADLY, APPROACHING ITS

5
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,100
FIRST BIRTHDAY.

6
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,200
AND, LIKE MOST ONE-YEAR-OLDS,

7
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:37,066
IT DOESN'T REALLY DO MUCH OTHER

8
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:38,466
THAN TERRIFY YOU WHEN IT'S

9
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:39,542
QUIET AND VAGUELY SMELL LIKE

10
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:40,833
OLD MILK.

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,800
IT'S BEEN A WILD WEEK,

12
00:00:42,866 --> 00:00:44,500
FROM ANDREW CUOMO'S SCANDALS

13
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:45,500
CONTINUING TO GROW, TO EIGHT

14
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:46,700
MODERATE DEMOCRATS KILLING A

15
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:48,133
$15 MINIMUM WAGE... WITH

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,766
KYRSTEN SINEMA DOING IT

17
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,009
IN A PARTICULARLY DICKISH WAY...

18
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:52,333
OH, THUMBS DOWN!

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,724
FUN!

20
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:54,733
TO THE FACT THAT

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,966
THE MILWAUKEE BUCKS RECENTLY

22
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:57,033
STARTED WELCOMING LIMITED

23
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,100
NUMBERS OF FANS BACK INTO

24
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,000
THEIR ARENA, AND DID IT LIKE

25
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:00,300
THIS.

26
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:01,666
THE HAND SANITIZER CAM!

27
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:02,500
LET'S GET THOSE HANDS CLEAN!

28
00:01:02,566 --> 00:01:02,966
HERE WE GO!

29
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:04,633
OH, IT'S ALL OVER YOU.

30
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,433
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO WASH YOUR HAIR

31
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,066
OUT, GOT HAND SANITIZER ALL OVER

32
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:07,333
IT.

33
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,466
RIGHT ON THE HOODIE.

34
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:10,433
GREAT JOB, BANGO, HE'S, LIKE,

35
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,576
GIVE ME ALL THE HAND SANITIZER,

36
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,833
KEEP ME CLEAN!

37
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,633
I DON'T KNOW IF WE WANT TO

38
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,200
RECOMMEND THAT, LET'S NOT DO

39
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:16,000
THAT.

40
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:17,400
YEAH!

41
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:18,866
LET'S NOT DO ANY OF THAT!

42
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:20,966
BECAUSE GETTING BUKKAKED BY

43
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:22,209
A CARTOON SQUIRT BOTTLE HAS TO

44
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:23,766
BE THE MOST AWKWARD WAY TO WIND

45
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,066
UP ON A JUMBOTRON, RIGHT AFTER

46
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:26,333
BEING FEATURED ON THE KISS CAM

47
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,133
WITH YOUR SIBLING, AND BEING

48
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,309
PROPOSED TO ON A FIRST DATE.

49
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,833
NO, ERIC!

50
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,366
FOR VARIOUS REASONS, NO!

51
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:32,666
AND WHY IS EVERYONE BOOING ME?

52
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:34,633
WE JUST MET!

53
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,100
AND IT'S NOT JUST ARENAS

54
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,366
OPENING UP.

55
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:38,700
BOTH TEXAS AND MISSISSIPPI

56
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,166
THIS WEEK ANNOUNCED PLANS TO

57
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,366
PRETTY MUCH DO AWAY WITH

58
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:42,900
GOVERNMENT COVID RESTRICTIONS.

59
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:44,600
TEXAS GOVERNOR GREG ABBOTT

60
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,500
SAYS FALLING HOSPITALIZATIONS

61
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:48,000
AND INCREASED VACCINATIONS MEAN

62
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:48,133
NO

63
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,400
STATE MANDATES ARE NO LONGER

64
00:01:50,466 --> 00:01:51,233
NEEDED, AND IT'S UP TO

65
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,400
INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES

66
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:54,966
TO BEHAVE RESPONSIBLY.

67
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:57,066
ALL BUSINESSES OF ANY TYPE

68
00:01:57,133 --> 00:01:57,200
NO

69
00:01:57,266 --> 00:02:01,033
ARE ALLOWED TO OPEN 100%

70
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,166
NO

71
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:03,233
ALSO, I AM ENDING THE STATEWIDE

72
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:08,000
MASK MANDATE.

73
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:09,066
WELL, THAT'S FUCKING

74
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:09,200
NO

75
00:02:09,266 --> 00:02:11,433
STUPID.

76
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,433
LIFTING ALL RESTRICTIONS IS

77
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,800
RIDICULOUS WHEN WE'RE STILL

78
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:14,533
NO

79
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,166
IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC...

80
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:15,900
AS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT

81
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:17,133
INSTEAD OF FORCING PEOPLE TO

82
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,533
KISS, WE'RE SQUIRTING THEM

83
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,966
WITH CARTOON EJACULATE.

84
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:22,900
AND THE THING IS, LEAVING IT UP

85
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:24,300
TO INDIVIDUALS TO "BEHAVE

86
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:25,566
NO

87
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:26,200
RESPONSIBLY" IS LIKELY TO CAUSE

88
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:27,500
IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS.

89
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:27,633
NO

90
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,633
BECAUSE WHILE BUSINESSES CAN

91
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,820
STILL REQUIRE PEOPLE TO WEAR

92
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:29,933
NO

93
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,700
MASKS, THE LACK OF A STATEWIDE

94
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:36,366
MANDATE COULD MAKE THINGS

95
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:37,033
DIFFICULT FOR THEM, AS THIS

96
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,166
BAR OWNER WILL TELL YOU.

97
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:39,166
YOU KNOW, WE'RE VERY USED

98
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:40,276
TO MAKING PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY

99
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,066
DON'T WANT TO DO.

100
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:42,233
YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN I.D.,

101
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,933
YOU CAN'T DRIVE DRUNK.

102
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,800
THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE, WITHOUT

103
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:44,766
A MANDATE FROM THE GOVERNMENT,

104
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,300
MAKES IT SEEM LIKE AN OPTIONAL

105
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,409
THING, AND SOMETHING THEY WANT

106
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:48,933
TO ARGUE ABOUT.

107
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,833
THE STATE ITSELF COULD GIVE US

108
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,009
THE COVER TO SAY, IT'S NOT ME,

109
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:54,533
IT'S THEM.

110
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,533
YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE!

111
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,966
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, CBS REALLY

112
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:58,042
DIDN'T HAVE TO TELL US HE WAS

113
00:02:58,066 --> 00:02:59,000
THE OWNER OF A BAR CALLED

114
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:00,366
"THE COTTONMOUTH CLUB."

115
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:01,473
GIVEN THAT HAT, THERE WERE

116
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,066
REALLY ONLY THREE OPTIONS:

117
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:04,466
BAR OWNER, SKA BAND HYPE MAN,

118
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:05,333
AND SPACE MECHANIC.

119
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,200
THAT'S IT.

120
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:11,466
AND WHILE I DO TAKE HIS LARGER

121
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:12,266
POINT, THAT IT'S SHITTY TO

122
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,000
MAKE BAR AND RESTAURANT

123
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:14,800
EMPLOYEES RESPONSIBLE FOR

124
00:03:14,866 --> 00:03:15,909
ENFORCING PUBLIC SAFETY, I'M

125
00:03:15,933 --> 00:03:16,600
GUESSING HE PERSONALLY HAS

126
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,033
THE CONFIDENCE TO DO THAT, GIVEN

127
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,833
THAT HE WENT ON CBS THIS MORNING

128
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,500
IN "THE FULL PHARRELL"

129
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:21,866
MEANWHILE, THIS WEEK THE FEDERAL

130
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:23,033
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN BUSY.

131
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,233
IN ADDITION TO THE SENATE

132
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,900
FINALLY PASSING THE COVID RELIEF

133
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:27,209
BILL, THE FBI DIRECTOR GAVE SOME

134
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:28,633
SIGNIFICANT TESTIMONY.

135
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,133
IN HIS FIRST APPEARANCE

136
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,433
BEFORE CONGRESS SINCE THE

137
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,100
JANUARY 6TH INSURRECTION,

138
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,966
FBI DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER WRAY

139
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:36,200
WAS SPECIFIC AND BLUNT ABOUT

140
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:39,566
WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE.

141
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:40,766
QUITE A NUMBER OF WHAT WE

142
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:41,700
WOULD CALL SORT OF "MILITIA

143
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:42,866
VIOLENT EXTREMISTS"...

144
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:45,000
PROUD BOYS OR THE OATH KEEPERS.

145
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:46,666
WE'VE ALREADY IDENTIFIED

146
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:48,033
INDIVIDUALS WHO ADVOCATE FOR

147
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,800
WHAT YOU WOULD CALL

148
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:50,100
WHITE SUPREMACY.

149
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,242
AND WHAT OF THE CONSPIRACIES

150
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:52,700
CLAIMING THAT IT WAS REALLY

151
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,266
LEFT WING RADICALS POSING AS

152
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,733
TRUMP SUPPORTERS WHO ATTACKED

153
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,766
THE CAPITOL?

154
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:58,909
DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT

155
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:00,600
THE CAPITOL ATTACK WAS ORGANIZED

156
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,266
BY "FAKE TRUMP PROTESTERS?"

157
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,133
WE HAVE NOT SEEN EVIDENCE OF

158
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,466
THAT.

159
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:05,666
YEAH, OF COURSE YOU

160
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:06,500
HAVEN'T, BECAUSE IT'S NOT

161
00:04:06,566 --> 00:04:08,066
FUCKING TRUE.

162
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:09,233
AND DESPITE EVERYTHING,

163
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,633
IT'S STILL AMAZING THAT HE HAS

164
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,860
TO DEBUNK A CONSPIRACY THEORY

165
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,033
THAT'S SO CLEARLY FALSE.

166
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,833
IT'D BE LIKE HAVING TO SWEAR

167
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,066
UNDER OATH THAT THREE LEMURS

168
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:17,000
IN A TRENCH COAT DIDN'T COMMIT

169
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:18,866
THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING.

170
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:20,400
OF COURSE THEY DIDN'T, AND

171
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:21,542
ANYONE WHO SUGGESTED THEY DID

172
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:22,400
CLEARLY HAS SOME SIGNIFICANTLY

173
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:23,900
BIGGER PROBLEMS.

174
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,300
NOW THAT TESTIMONY WAS PRETTY

175
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:27,000
NEWSWORTHY.

176
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,300
BUT WHILE SOME NETWORKS

177
00:04:28,366 --> 00:04:29,566
TOOK THE HEARINGS LIVE, FOX,

178
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:30,333
UNSURPRISINGLY, BARELY

179
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,766
COVERED IT.

180
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,266
IN FACT, ACROSS CONSERVATIVE

181
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,333
MEDIA, YOU'D HARDLY KNOW IT HAD

182
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,533
HAPPENED.

183
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,300
BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO BUSY WITH

184
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:38,866
THIS.

185
00:04:38,933 --> 00:04:41,066
DR. SEUSS GETTING CANCELED.

186
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:43,300
THE CHILDREN'S BOOK PUBLISHER

187
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,442
SAYS IT WILL STOP RELEASING SIX

188
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:46,066
OF HIS BOOKS.

189
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:47,466
THE CANCEL CULTURE GOING

190
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:49,333
AFTER DR. SEUSS TONIGHT.

191
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,700
DR. SEUSS BOOKS ARE NOW TOO

192
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:53,333
INSENSITIVE AND EVEN RACIST FOR

193
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,133
THIS MOB.

194
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,300
THEY ARE BANNING DR. SEUSS

195
00:04:58,366 --> 00:05:00,966
BOOKS.

196
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:04,766
HOW MUCH MORE DO YOU NEED TO SEE

197
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,733
BEFORE ALL OF AMERICA WAKES UP

198
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,400
AND GOES, "THIS IS FASCISM"?

199
00:05:09,466 --> 00:05:14,266
OH, I DON'T KNOW,

200
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,200
UH, A LOT MORE?

201
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:15,966
BECAUSE THE BOOKS WEREN'T

202
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:17,100
"BANNED."

203
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,176
DR. SEUSS ENTERPRISES DECIDED TO

204
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,240
STOP PRINTING SIX OF THEM.

205
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:20,533
AND A COMPANY DECIDING WHICH OF

206
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,933
ITS OWN BOOKS IT WILL OR WON'T

207
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,733
PRINT IS AN EXAMPLE OF FREE

208
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,833
ENTERPRISE, NOT FASCISM.

209
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,033
IT'D MAKE AS MUCH SENSE TO

210
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,900
ARGUE, "THEY'RE BANNING

211
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:27,566
UNICYCLES.

212
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:29,166
HOW MUCH MORE DO YOU NEED TO SEE

213
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:29,866
BEFORE AMERICA WAKES UP AND

214
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:30,766
SAYS, THIS IS

215
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,266
TRANSCENDENTALISM?"

216
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,000
THE FIRST THING ISN'T EVEN TRUE,

217
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:35,076
AND I'VE GOT NO IDEA HOW YOU GOT

218
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,066
FROM THERE TO THE SECOND PART.

219
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:38,566
AND GIVEN HOW STRONGLY ALL THOSE

220
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:40,000
COMMENTATORS WERE DEFENDING

221
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:41,766
THOSE BOOKS, IT'S WORTH KNOWING

222
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:42,700
WHAT, EXACTLY, THEY'RE

223
00:05:42,766 --> 00:05:43,300
DEFENDING.

224
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:45,033
BECAUSE THE IMAGES IN QUESTION

225
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,900
INCLUDE THIS OLD-TIMEY

226
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:48,300
CARICATURE OF "A CHINESE MAN

227
00:05:48,366 --> 00:05:49,633
WHO EATS WITH STICKS," ACTUALLY

228
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,666
TONED DOWN FROM THE ORIGINAL,

229
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,600
WHERE HE WAS LITERALLY YELLOW,

230
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,433
AND CALLED THIS, AND THERE'S

231
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,700
ALSO DRAWINGS THAT RESEMBLE

232
00:05:56,766 --> 00:05:57,300
MONKEYS, REPRESENTING PEOPLE

233
00:05:57,366 --> 00:05:59,133
FROM AFRICA.

234
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,966
AND ARE THESE THINGS WE REALLY

235
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:02,900
WANT TO FIGHT FOR KIDS TO SEE?

236
00:06:02,966 --> 00:06:04,366
TO BE HONEST, I'M SQUEAMISH

237
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:05,673
ABOUT SHOWING THEM TO YOU RIGHT

238
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,733
NOW, AND JUST THREE MINUTES AGO,

239
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,100
I WAS HAPPY TO SUBJECT YOU TO

240
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:12,233
A BASKETBALL ARENA JIZZ STORM.

241
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,633
THE POINT IS, THESE IMAGES ARE

242
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,066
ROUGH, WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY,

243
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:15,966
FOR THE MOST PART, FOX DIDN'T

244
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:17,766
ACTUALLY SHOW THEM.

245
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,366
INSTEAD, OFTEN FOCUSING ON BOOKS

246
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:20,133
THAT AREN'T EVEN BEING

247
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
QUESTIONED.

248
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:23,766
TUCKER CARLSON FOCUSED A WHOLE

249
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,000
SEGMENT ON "THE SNEETCHES"...

250
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:26,209
WHICH ISN'T BEING PULLED... SO

251
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:27,509
HE COULD PLAY HIS FAVORITE GAME:

252
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:28,833
LIBERALS ARE THE REAL RACISTS.

253
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,033
FOR 60 YEARS, AMERICAN

254
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,600
CHILDREN HAVE READ

255
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:32,966
"THE SNEETCHES" AND BOOKS

256
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:34,700
LIKE IT, AND THAT'S ONE OF THE

257
00:06:34,766 --> 00:06:35,876
REASONS WE HAVE THE COUNTRY WE

258
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,133
HAVE TODAY.

259
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,033
THE STORY IS A PLEA FOR

260
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,866
COLORBLINDNESS, AND THAT'S WHY

261
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,200
THE FORCES OF WOKENESS HATE IT

262
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:44,700
AND DR. SEUSS.

263
00:06:44,766 --> 00:06:46,666
WHEN THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE CANCEL

264
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,333
DR. SEUSS, WHAT THEY'RE REALLY

265
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,933
TRYING TO ELIMINATE IS A VERY

266
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,200
SPECIFIC KIND OF MID-CENTURY

267
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:53,409
AMERICAN CULTURE, A CULTURE THAT

268
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:54,266
CHAMPIONED MERITOCRACY AND

269
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,200
COLORBLINDNESS.

270
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:57,933
FIRST, SHUT THE FUCK

271
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,733
UP, TUCKER, YOU FEAR-MONGERING

272
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,500
LACROSSE INJURY.

273
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:01,966
SECOND, IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD TO

274
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:02,966
CLAIM THAT MID-CENTURY AMERICAN

275
00:07:03,033 --> 00:07:04,766
CULTURE CHAMPIONED

276
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,333
COLORBLINDNESS WHEN SIGNS

277
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,433
FROM THE TIME EXPLICITLY

278
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,133
DEMANDED THE OPPOSITE.

279
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,933
IN FACT, TO THE EXTENT ANYONE IS

280
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,933
TRYING TO ELIMINATE SOME PARTS

281
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,366
OF AMERICAN CULTURE, IT'S THE

282
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:16,666
PARTS THAT PERPETUATE RACISM,

283
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:18,466
XENOPHOBIA, AND BIGOTRY.

284
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:19,900
BUT IT'S NOT HARD TO SEE WHY

285
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:21,800
TUCKER WOULD BE SO ANXIOUS TO

286
00:07:21,866 --> 00:07:23,700
TALK ABOUT DR. SEUSS THIS WEEK.

287
00:07:23,766 --> 00:07:26,033
BECAUSE IF HE'D TALKED ABOUT

288
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,033
CHRISTOPHER WRAY'S TESTIMONY

289
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,400
ABOUT WHITE SUPREMACISTS

290
00:07:28,466 --> 00:07:29,766
PARTICIPATING IN THE ATTACK

291
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:30,933
ON THE CAPITOL, IT WOULD'VE

292
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,500
CONTRADICTED WHAT HE'S BEEN

293
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:32,166
TELLING HIS VIEWERS FOR WEEKS

294
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:33,666
NOW, LIKE, "THERE'S NO EVIDENCE

295
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,033
THAT WHITE SUPREMACISTS WERE

296
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,600
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED

297
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,433
ON JANUARY 6TH.

298
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,366
THAT'S A LIE."

299
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:40,300
SO INSTEAD, TUCKER AND

300
00:07:40,366 --> 00:07:42,266
CONSERVATIVE MEDIA FELL BACK ON

301
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,533
THEIR CLASSIC PLAYBOOK OF

302
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,766
DISTRACTING FROM IMPORTANT

303
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:45,966
ISSUES WITH BULLSHIT

304
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,300
CULTURE WARS.

305
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,233
IT'S INCREDIBLY LAZY AND

306
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,900
DEPRESSINGLY EFFECTIVE.

307
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:53,900
AND THE THING IS, NO MATTER HOW

308
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:55,076
MANY TIMES I SEE THEM DO IT,

309
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,666
IT NEVER FAILS TO LEAVE ME

310
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:58,100
FEELING COMPLETELY DISGUSTED,

311
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,366
AND LIKE THERE'S NO WAY TO GET

312
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:00,566
CLEAN.

313
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:03,566
OH, NO!

314
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:04,800
NO, PLEASE, NO!

315
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:11,733
NO, NOT LIKE THIS!

316
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,700
NO, I DON'T WANT THIS!

317
00:08:12,766 --> 00:08:16,300
HOW IS THIS FUN FOR ANYONE?

318
00:08:16,366 --> 00:08:17,533
PLEASE STOP AT!

319
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,133
I FEEL DIRTIER NOW.

320
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,333
AND NOW THIS.

321
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,766
STOP IT!

322
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,400
AND NOW,

323
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:25,542
NEIL CAVUTO REALLY LOVES ADELE.

324
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:27,400
DO YOU FIND IT A TAD BIT

325
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,166
CURIOUS, ON MONDAY, WHEN THE DOW

326
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:31,900
WAS UP 143 POINTS, THE FIRST DAY

327
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:33,046
OF TRADING AFTER THE SINGER

328
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,200
ADELE HAD SWEPT T THE GRAMMYS.

329
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:36,166
SCIENTIST IN BRAZIL HAVE

330
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:37,566
FOUND THAT LISTENING TO HER

331
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:38,400
MUSIC COULD REDUCE STRESS AND

332
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:41,333
HELP TO KEEP PEOPLE'S HEART

333
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:41,566
HEALTHY.

334
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:42,333
I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU THIS FOR

335
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:42,533
YEARS.

336
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,666
I AM WAITING ON ADELE TO CALL

337
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,033
ME AND UPDATE ME.

338
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,266
MICHAEL, ARE YOU A ADELE FAN?

339
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,266
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THIS.

340
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:50,566
ADELE.

341
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:52,066
>IT'S BECAUSE WE DIDN'T EVEN GET

342
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:53,300
TO TALK ABOUT ADELE.

343
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,300
DO WE KNOW, ARE THERE ANY

344
00:08:55,366 --> 00:08:57,033
ADELE UPDATES?

345
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,566
I WILL POINT OUT THAT ADELE

346
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:00,433
NEVER HAD ANY ISSUES.

347
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,133
SORRY, TAYLOR, YOU HAVE NOT

348
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,366
TOPPED ADELE.

349
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:06,533
I COULDN'T IMAGINE ADELE DOING

350
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:06,833
IT.

351
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,533
IT MAKES A LOT OF PEOPLE

352
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,800
UNCOMFORTABLE THAT I HAVE THIS

353
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:10,366
FIXATION BECAUSE SHE'S YOUNG

354
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:11,133
ENOUGH TO BE MY DAUGHTER.

355
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,900
I THINK THAT IS THE MARKET'S

356
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:17,566
WAY OF SAYING HELLO, HELLO,

357
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:23,466
HELLO, HELLO.

358
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:24,200
MOVING ON.

359
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:25,376
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

360
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,000
UNEMPLOYMENT.

361
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,276
THE THING THAT WOULD ABSOLUTELY

362
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:27,966
HAPPEN TO ME IF AT&T EXECUTIVES

363
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:28,633
EVER FIND OUT WHAT I'VE BEEN

364
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,700
SAYING ABOUT THEM.

365
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:30,566
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, WHAT ARE

366
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:31,266
THEY GOING TO DO?

367
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,266
LOOK IT UP ONLINE?

368
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,100
HOW?

369
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:33,966
WITH THEIR INTERNET PLAN?

370
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:34,833
AND THEN CALL SOMEONE?

371
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,266
USING AT&T?

372
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,333
I THINK I'M FINE.

373
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,266
UNEMPLOYMENT CAN BE A TRAUMATIC

374
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,900
EVENT FOR ANYONE, EVEN PUPPETS.

375
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:40,866
WHY ISN'T MOMMY AT WORK

376
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:41,966
TODAY?

377
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:44,833
YESTERDAY, I LOST MY JOB.

378
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,733
AND I'M NOT GOING TO BE WORKING,

379
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,333
AT LEAST FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

380
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,900
IS IT BECAUSE ELMO HAS TOO

381
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,766
MANY TOYS?

382
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:54,876
OH, NO, NO, BABY, NONE OF

383
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,000
THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

384
00:09:56,066 --> 00:10:00,566
IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT.

385
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,633
WELL, WELL, HOLD ON.

386
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,600
ARE WE ABSOLUTELY SURE IT'S NOT

387
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:03,600
ELMO'S FAULT?

388
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,400
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THAT PLANE

389
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:06,133
COSTS, BUT I DO KNOW MAINTAINING

390
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,866
A CRAYON-COLORED, LIMINAL

391
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:08,600
APARTMENT WHERE YOU LIVE

392
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:09,666
PART-TIME WITH DOROTHY,

393
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:11,000
YOUR PET FISH, MIGHT BE A

394
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:11,800
PROBLEM FOR YOUR NOW ONE-INCOME

395
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:13,233
FAMILY.

396
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,700
SO IT'S NOT NOT YOUR FAULT,

397
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:16,266
ELMO.

398
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,100
BUT ALSO, QUICK SHOUT-OUT TO

399
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,466
ELMO'S MOM THERE.

400
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:20,000
SHE'S GOING THROUGH SOME SHIT,

401
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:21,109
BUT STILL MANAGED TO GET HER

402
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:22,242
HAIR UP IN TWO STRAND TWISTS

403
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:22,833
BEFORE SHE WENT TO BED THE NIGHT

404
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,900
BEFORE.

405
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:25,300
SHE'S TAKING CARE OF HERSELF AND

406
00:10:25,366 --> 00:10:26,300
PROTECTING THOSE EDGES.

407
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:27,666
DROP THE ROUTINE, MAE!

408
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:28,900
POST THE SHELFIE ON THE GRAM.

409
00:10:28,966 --> 00:10:29,700
WHAT ARE YOUR HOLY GRAIL

410
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:30,266
PRODUCTS?

411
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,233
PATTERN BEAUTY?

412
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,366
SHEA MOISTURE?

413
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:33,300
OR ARE YOU STILL ROCKIN' IT

414
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,446
OLD SCHOOL WITH A BOTTLE OF

415
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,766
PINK OIL AND A JAR OF JAM?

416
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,400
I SEE YOU, ELMO'S MOM!

417
00:10:38,466 --> 00:10:39,800
BUT EVEN FOR THE NON-PUPPET

418
00:10:39,866 --> 00:10:41,733
POPULATION, UNEMPLOYMENT IS AN

419
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,233
ESPECIALLY PERTINENT TOPIC RIGHT

420
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,966
NOW.

421
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:46,566
IT'S BEEN ALMOST EXACTLY A YEAR

422
00:10:46,633 --> 00:10:47,876
SINCE THE PANDEMIC HIT, AND TENS

423
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,766
OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR

424
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:50,909
JOBS... MANY OF WHOM FILED FOR

425
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:52,366
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE, OR

426
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:53,633
"UNEMPLOYMENT."

427
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,466
OUR CURRENT SYSTEM WAS CREATED

428
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:57,600
IN THE 1930s.

429
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:58,776
AND THE BASIC IDEA WAS, LIKE

430
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,080
MOST INSURANCE, TO GATHER FUNDS,

431
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:02,533
PARTICULARLY IN GOOD TIMES, SO

432
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,333
THERE'D BE MONEY AVAILABLE TO

433
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,766
DISBURSE IN BAD TIMES.

434
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,200
AND TO PAY FOR ALL OF THIS,

435
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,400
STATES WOULD TAX EMPLOYERS.

436
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:11,833
THE CONCEPT WAS ENTHUSIASTICALLY

437
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,366
PROMOTED AT THE TIME, WITH

438
00:11:12,433 --> 00:11:14,300
EDUCATIONAL FILMS LIKE THIS.

439
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:16,233
TO SHOW HOW JOB INSURANCE

440
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,733
WORKS, LET'S INTRODUCE STEVE,

441
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,633
A LOUISIANA WORKER WHO HAS JUST

442
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,133
LOST HIS JOB.

443
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,266
NOW EACH WEEK, THE LETTER

444
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,900
CARRIER BRINGS STEVE A CHECK

445
00:11:23,966 --> 00:11:25,109
FOR HALF THE NORMAL WEEKLY WAGE

446
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:27,233
HE USED TO EARN.

447
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,600
THE MAXIMUM IS $15, THE MINIMUM

448
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,933
IS $5, OR THREE-FOURTHS OF HIS

449
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,200
EARNINGS.

450
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:33,666
JOB INSURANCE, THIS IS THE WAY

451
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:35,733
THE STATE OF LOUISIANA IS DOING

452
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,766
ITS PART IN THE NATIONWIDE

453
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,866
CRUSADE AGAINST UNEMPLOYMENT,

454
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,533
FEAR, AND INSECURITY.

455
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,733
YES!

456
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,566
ATTA BOY, STEVE!

457
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:45,709
THAT NEWSREEL, OF COURSE, FROM

458
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:47,133
THE MAKERS OF SUCH CLASSICS AS

459
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,333
THE WOMAN WHO

460
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,866
WILL NEVER DIE, " AND " HOW TO

461
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:51,976
FIGHT THE NAZIS EVEN THOUGH,

462
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,533
GIVEN THIS ERA'S PREVALENT

463
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,966
ANTI-SEMITISM, YOU MOSTLY LIKELY

464
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:55,933
AGREE WITH A LOT OF WHAT THEY'RE

465
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,933
SAYING."

466
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,466
BUT UNEMPLOYMENT WASN'T JUST

467
00:11:58,533 --> 00:11:59,866
CREATED TO SAVE OUR NATION'S

468
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:01,766
STEVES FROM FEAR AND INSECURITY.

469
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,200
ECONOMISTS GENERALLY AGREE THAT

470
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:05,466
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IS

471
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:07,200
ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MOST

472
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:10,500
EFFECTIVE POLICIES FOR

473
00:12:10,566 --> 00:12:11,576
RECOVERING FROM A RECESSION.

474
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,000
WHICH MAKES SENSE.

475
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:13,766
BECAUSE WHEN YOU GIVE THE

476
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:14,500
UNEMPLOYED MONEY, THEY TEND

477
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:15,466
NOT TO HOARD IT OFFSHORE

478
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:16,766
IN THE CAYMANS.

479
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,766
THEY SPEND IT ON SHIT THEY NEED.

480
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,666
IN FACT, ANALYSIS FROM PAST

481
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:22,876
RECESSIONS SHOWS, EVERY DOLLAR

482
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,833
SPENT ON UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

483
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,140
BOOSTED ECONOMYWIDE SPENDING BY

484
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:33,166
AS MUCH AS $2.

485
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,100
SO IT'S A VITAL SOCIAL SAFETY

486
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,166
NET AND HAS MASSIVE

487
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:38,533
MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS.

488
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,400
BUT DESPITE THAT, OVER THE

489
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:40,476
YEARS, OUR SYSTEM HAS BADLY

490
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,300
BROKEN DOWN.

491
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:42,476
SOMETHING THAT BECAME PAINFULLY

492
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,066
CLEAR THIS TIME LAST YEAR WHEN

493
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:43,866
IT WAS OVERWHELMED BY NEW

494
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:44,766
CLAIMS.

495
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,109
WE FEATURED STORIES ON THIS SHOW

496
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,000
OF PEOPLE HAVING TO CALL

497
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,176
50 TIMES A DAY JUST TO MAKE AN

498
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,233
UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIM.

499
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,166
BUT THAT WAS THE TIP OF THE

500
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:51,466
ICEBERG.

501
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:52,666
KENTUCKY RESIDENTS POURED

502
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:53,842
INTO THE CAPITAL FOR THEIR FIRST

503
00:12:53,866 --> 00:12:55,333
CHANCE TO GET AN IN-PERSON

504
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,609
MEETING AT A POP-UP UNEMPLOYMENT

505
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:58,733
OFFICE SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN.

506
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,266
BREANNA GLASS APPLIED THREE

507
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,666
MONTHS AGO AND IS STILL HAVING

508
00:13:01,733 --> 00:13:03,466
TROUBLE GETTING PAYMENTS.

509
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,333
SHE STOOD IN LINE YESTERDAY JUST

510
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,366
DAYS AFTER GIVING BIRTH.

511
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:08,100
I MEAN, I'VE CALLED, I'VE

512
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,266
EMAILED.

513
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,866
I DID EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY

514
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:11,600
COULD.

515
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,200
AND STILL, NOTHING.

516
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:15,100
HOLY SHIT.

517
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,166
WAITING IN LINE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT

518
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:18,500
JUST AFTER GIVING BIRTH IS

519
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:21,433
ALREADY APPALLING.

520
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,800
BUT THE VERY PHRASE "POP-UP

521
00:13:22,866 --> 00:13:25,066
UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE" IS TRULY

522
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:25,333
ALARMING.

523
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,200
MUCH LIKE "EMERGENCY

524
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:27,400
CREMATORIUM " OR " ELEPHANT

525
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:28,933
FORCEPS," IT SUGGESTS THINGS

526
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,076
HAVE GONE TERRIBLY WRONG AND

527
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,966
ARE ABOUT TO GET SIGNIFICANTLY

528
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:32,600
WORSE.

529
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,066
NOW, SOME OF LAST YEAR'S CHAOS

530
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:35,400
WAS BECAUSE STATES' ANTIQUATED

531
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:37,866
SYSTEMS WERE SIMPLY OVERWHELMED.

532
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:39,233
BUT IT'S A MISTAKE TO THINK OF

533
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,866
THIS MERELY AS A TECHNOLOGICAL

534
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:42,266
PROBLEM.

535
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,000
BECAUSE THE SYSTEM UNDERNEATH

536
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:46,333
THAT SHITTY TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN

537
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:46,866
BROKEN FOR YEARS NOW, AND

538
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:48,033
SOMETIMES DELIBERATELY.

539
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,266
A QUICK WAY TO MEASURE THE

540
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,033
HEALTH OF A STATE'S SYSTEM IS

541
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,209
THROUGH ITS "RECIPIENCY RATE"...

542
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:53,666
THAT IS BASICALLY, THE

543
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:55,433
PERCENTAGE OF UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE

544
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,200
THAT ACTUALLY RECEIVE BENEFITS.

545
00:13:57,266 --> 00:13:59,266
NOW, IT WILL NEVER BE 100%

546
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,800
IN THIS COUNTRY, BECAUSE...

547
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:02,300
RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY... NOT

548
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:02,966
EVERYONE OUT OF WORK IS

549
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:04,466
ELIGIBLE.

550
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:05,433
GENERALLY, ONLY THOSE WHO ARE

551
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,166
LAID OFF ARE.

552
00:14:08,233 --> 00:14:09,066
AND THAT IS JUST OVER

553
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:10,300
HALF THE UNEMPLOYED.

554
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:11,166
THE REST... LIKE THOSE FRESH

555
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:12,100
OUT OF SCHOOL, OR WHO QUIT

556
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,300
VOLUNTARILY, OR WHO WERE

557
00:14:13,366 --> 00:14:14,166
FIRED... ARE GENERALLY NOT

558
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:15,366
COVERED.

559
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:16,576
THAT IS WHY, EXPERTS SAY THAT

560
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,900
UNDER OUR CURRENT SYSTEM,

561
00:14:17,966 --> 00:14:19,009
A GOOD RULE OF THUMB IS THAT

562
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:20,142
A STATE'S RECIPIENCY RATE SHOULD

563
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,466
BE AROUND 50%.

564
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:24,266
THE PROBLEM IS, NATIONALLY,

565
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,766
EVEN BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC,

566
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,366
WE WERE AT JUST 28%.

567
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:28,733
AND IN SOME STATES,

568
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,166
LIKE NORTH CAROLINA AND FLORIDA,

569
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:32,600
IT WAS AROUND 10%!

570
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,166
JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT

571
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:35,800
OUT OF EVERY TEN

572
00:14:35,866 --> 00:14:37,233
UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE IN THOSE

573
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,566
STATES, ONLY ONE IS ACTUALLY

574
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:40,966
RECEIVING BENEFITS.

575
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:42,733
IF YOU BOARDED AN AIRPLANE AND

576
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,920
LEARNED THAT ONLY ONE IN TEN

577
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,133
SEATS HAD AN OXYGEN MASK,

578
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,000
YOU'D WONDER "WHO DESIGNED THIS

579
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:50,533
SYSTEM?, " " WHY DID THEY MAKE IT

580
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,133
THIS WAY?"

581
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,666
AND "HOW DO I GET OUT OF HERE

582
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:53,633
RIGHT FUCKING NOW?"

583
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,166
SO GIVEN THAT, TONIGHT, LET'S

584
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:56,509
LOOK AT OUR CURRENT UNEMPLOYMENT

585
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:57,033
SYSTEM.

586
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,333
AND THE FIRST THING TO KNOW IS,

587
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,666
IT IS NOT ONE SYSTEM.

588
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,066
FROM THE VERY START, STATES WERE

589
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:03,333
GIVEN HUGE LATITUDE IN RUNNING

590
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:04,700
THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS.

591
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:06,133
MEANING WE ESSENTIALLY HAVE

592
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,366
53 COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS,

593
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:09,900
ONE FOR EACH STATE, PLUS D.C.,

594
00:15:09,966 --> 00:15:11,266
PUERTO RICO, AND

595
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,933
THE VIRGIN ISLANDS.

596
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,533
AND NOT ONLY IS THAT

597
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,866
INEFFICIENT, IT MEANS THE LEVEL

598
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:18,333
OF BENEFITS VARY WILDLY.

599
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,366
MASSACHUSETTS PAYS THE MOST,

600
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:22,566
UP TO $1234 A WEEK.

601
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:23,333
FLORIDA'S MAXIMUM?

602
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,766
$275 A WEEK.

603
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,133
THAT IS A HELL OF

604
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,966
A DIFFERENCE.

605
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:29,533
IT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE MIGHT WANT

606
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,366
TO FACTOR IN IF THEY'RE

607
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:32,000
CONSIDERING MOVING SOMEWHERE.

608
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:34,600
"WELL, THE CLIMATE SEEMS NICER,

609
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:35,776
AND THE SCHOOLS SEEM DECENT...

610
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,533
BEFORE I GO, LET ME JUST GOOGLE,

611
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,233
IF I LOSE MY JOB, WILL THIS

612
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,133
STATE LET ME STARVE?"

613
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,800
AND IT'S NOT JUST WHERE YOU LIVE

614
00:15:42,866 --> 00:15:44,066
THAT DETERMINES YOUR BENEFITS.

615
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:45,866
IT ALSO MATTERS WHAT YOU DO.

616
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:47,533
BECAUSE MANY PART-TIME WORKERS,

617
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,933
PLUS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND

618
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,733
GIG WORKERS TYPICALLY DON'T

619
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,300
QUALIFY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT.

620
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:57,376
WHICH IS ABSURD, GIVEN THAT

621
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,700
THOSE JOBS MAKE UP A SIGNIFICANT

622
00:15:58,766 --> 00:15:59,976
PORTION OF OUR MODERN WORKFORCE.

623
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,800
AND INCIDENTALLY, BLACK WORKERS

624
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:02,976
ARE OVERREPRESENTED IN THOSE

625
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,500
TYPES OF JOBS, JUST AS THEY'RE

626
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:05,676
OVERREPRESENTED IN THE STATES

627
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,833
WITH THE LEAST-GENEROUS

628
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,866
BENEFITS, WHICH MIGHT EXPLAIN

629
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:13,433
WHY BLACK WORKERS ARE MORE

630
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,933
LIKELY TO BE UNEMPLOYED, BUT

631
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,666
LESS LIKELY TO GET UNEMPLOYMENT

632
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:16,733
BENEFITS.

633
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:18,633
AND INEQUITY WAS BAKED INTO

634
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,400
THE SYSTEM FROM THE VERY

635
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:20,000
BEGINNING.

636
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:20,933
IN THE 1930s, AGRICULTURAL AND

637
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,833
DOMESTIC WORKERS WERE INITIALLY

638
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,566
PURPOSELY EXCLUDED, MEANING THAT

639
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:25,433
65% OF BLACK WORKERS WEREN'T

640
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,233
COVERED BY THE PROGRAM.

641
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,442
IT SEEMS IN THE U.S., YOU CAN

642
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:30,966
BASICALLY POINT TO ANYTHING,

643
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:31,966
ASK "HOW IS THAT RACIST," AND

644
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:32,500
GET A SPECIFIC, HISTORICAL

645
00:16:32,566 --> 00:16:33,333
ANSWER.

646
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,633
FREEWAYS?

647
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,933
DEMOLISHED BLACK COMMUNITIES.

648
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,200
MICKEY MOUSE?

649
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:38,500
BASED ON MINSTREL SHOWS.

650
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:40,166
THIS TODDLER?

651
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,700
WELL, HIS NAME IS KENDALL,

652
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:43,833
SO IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.

653
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,900
THE POINT IS, IN MANY STATES,

654
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:47,466
FOR MYRIAD REASONS, YOU MAY NOT

655
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:49,966
BE ABLE TO GET UNEMPLOYMENT,

656
00:16:50,033 --> 00:16:51,209
AND EVEN IF YOU DO, IT MAY NOT

657
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:54,333
BE ENOUGH TO LIVE ON.

658
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,766
THAT IS SOMETHING THE FEDERAL

659
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,042
GOVERNMENT SEEMED TO ACKNOWLEDGE

660
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:58,533
WAS A PROBLEM LAST YEAR, WHEN

661
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,400
IT SUDDENLY TEMPORARILY EXPANDED

662
00:16:59,466 --> 00:17:00,600
UNEMPLOYMENT TO COVER MORE

663
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,400
WORKERS, AND BOOSTED BENEFITS

664
00:17:02,466 --> 00:17:05,000
BY $600 ACROSS THE BOARD.

665
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,933
SO HOW DID OUR SYSTEM GET THIS

666
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,966
SHITTY?

667
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:09,533
AND WHOSE FAULT IS IT?

668
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,533
IS IT ELMO'S?

669
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,200
THE ANSWER'S NOT DEFINITELY "NO"

670
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:14,866
YET.

671
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,700
BUT THE TRUTH IS, A LOT OF THE

672
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:18,200
SYSTEM'S SHORTCOMINGS WERE THE

673
00:17:18,266 --> 00:17:19,409
RESULT OF DELIBERATE CHOICES.

674
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:20,766
FOR ONE, REMEMBER, BUSINESSES

675
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,633
FUND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE,

676
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,800
THROUGH TAXES THAT GO INTO

677
00:17:23,866 --> 00:17:25,166
STATE TRUST FUNDS.

678
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:26,733
AND AFTER THE LAST FINANCIAL

679
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,600
CRISIS DRAINED THOSE FUNDS,

680
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,400
STATES NEEDED TO RESTORE THEM.

681
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,266
BUT RATHER THAN DO THE SENSIBLE

682
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,533
THING... RAISE TAXES TO GET MORE

683
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,000
MONEY COMING IN... MANY OPTED TO

684
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:37,366
INSTEAD JUST CUT BENEFITS AND

685
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:38,800
MAKE THEM HARDER TO GET.

686
00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:40,533
AND AS THEY DID THIS, SOME IN

687
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,166
THE NATIONAL MEDIA CHEERED THEM

688
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:43,100
ON, LIKE SENTIENT PLANTATION

689
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,100
WEDDING, LAURA INGRAHAM.

690
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,966
IT'S SIMPLE HUMAN NATURE THAT

691
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:48,400
PEOPLE ARE A LITTLE LESS

692
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:49,542
MOTIVATED AS LONG AS THERE'S

693
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:50,700
A CHECK COMING IN.

694
00:17:50,766 --> 00:17:53,066
YOU KNOW WHAT MY MOM USED TO

695
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:54,866
SAY... GOD REST HER SOUL... WHEN

696
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:55,600
YOU'RE HUNGRY, YOU'LL FIGURE OUT

697
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,433
A WAY TO EAT.

698
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,033
RIGHT?

699
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,733
HUNGER BRINGS DRIVE, HUNGER

700
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,200
FOR OPPORTUNITY, HUNGER

701
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:07,966
FOR A PAYCHECK, HUNGER FOR

702
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:09,400
ACTUAL FOOD, HUNGER FOR A

703
00:18:09,466 --> 00:18:11,666
LIFESTYLE, A WAY OF LIFE.

704
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:13,100
BOY, YOU FIND IT WHEN THERE'S

705
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:13,833
NO HELPING HAND.

706
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,033
WOW.

707
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,500
"WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY, YOU'LL

708
00:18:17,566 --> 00:18:22,366
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO EAT."

709
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:23,300
WELL, SOMETIMES, LAURA.

710
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:26,900
THE PROBLEM IS, SOMETIMES NOT!

711
00:18:26,966 --> 00:18:27,900
AND THEN IT'S A TRAGEDY.

712
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:29,433
THERE'S A REASON THAT FAMINES

713
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,066
AREN'T GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS

714
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:31,142
"A LACK OF CAN-DO ATTITUDE."

715
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,633
AND THAT KIND OF RHETORIC

716
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,233
HAS BECOME PRETTY POPULAR.

717
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:34,766
YOUR MOST RACIST UNCLE HAS

718
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:35,700
UNDOUBTEDLY SAID SOMETHING

719
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:36,700
SIMILAR, PROBABLY TO A WAITRESS

720
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:37,700
AT RED LOBSTER, COMPLETELY

721
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:39,433
RUINING MOTHER'S DAY.

722
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,866
AND THAT SPEAKS TO THE KIND OF

723
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:42,200
ATTITUDES TOWARD THE

724
00:18:42,266 --> 00:18:43,533
UNEMPLOYED... RANGING FROM

725
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,033
SIMMERING CONTEMPT TO A CALLOUS

726
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,800
DISREGARD... THAT LIE BENEATH

727
00:18:46,866 --> 00:18:48,333
MANY STATES' AGGRESSIVE POLICY

728
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,800
CHANGES OVER THE PAST DECADE.

729
00:18:50,866 --> 00:18:52,533
STARTING IN 2012, TENNESSEE

730
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,066
PASSED LAWS MAKING THE PROCESS

731
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,266
TO APPLY FAR MORE DIFFICULT.

732
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,453
ONE JUSTIFICATION BEING THAT

733
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,700
SOMEHOW, LOADS OF PEOPLE

734
00:18:59,766 --> 00:19:00,842
INELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS WERE

735
00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:02,633
STILL GETTING THEM.

736
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,466
WHICH IS NONSENSE, BUT SOMETHING

737
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:05,200
THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR BACK

738
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,200
THEN, RON RAMSEY, CERTAINLY

739
00:19:06,266 --> 00:19:07,433
BELIEVED.

740
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,133
IF YOU WERE FIRED FROM YOUR

741
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,700
JOB FOR JUST CAUSE, MAYBE EVEN

742
00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:12,566
FOR STEALING FROM YOUR EMPLOYER

743
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:13,713
OR CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM, YOU

744
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:14,466
SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DRAW

745
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:15,600
UNEMPLOYMENT.

746
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:16,742
YOU DON'T GET UNEMPLOYMENT

747
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:17,500
INSURANCE IF YOU'RE FIRED WITH

748
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:18,433
CAUSE NOW.

749
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,700
THE LAW SAYS THEY'RE NOT

750
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:22,233
SUPPOSED TO, BUT, BUDDY, LET ME

751
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,566
ASSURE YOU, NINE TIMES OUT OF

752
00:19:23,633 --> 00:19:24,566
TEN, THEY GET THEIR WORKERS

753
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:25,676
COMP, OR THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT.

754
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,366
I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT'S

755
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:26,833
THE CASE.

756
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,800
NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN?

757
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:28,533
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT,

758
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,133
OKAY.

759
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,300
THAT WAS... THAT WAS A

760
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:31,566
RON RAMSEY BLANKET STATEMENT

761
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:34,600
THERE, BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF

762
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:35,676
EXAMPLES THAT THEY GET IT.

763
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,833
OH, YEAH!

764
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,133
DON'T WORRY... THAT'S JUST

765
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,700
A CLASSIC RON RAMSEY BLANKET

766
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:40,066
STATEMENT.

767
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:41,033
AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN GOOD

768
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,466
HANDS WHEN A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL

769
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:45,466
LIES ENOUGH TO WARRANT

770
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:46,933
A FUCKING TRADEMARK.

771
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,366
NOW RAMSEY ALSO ARGUED FOR

772
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:49,866
DRUG-TESTING THE UNEMPLOYED,

773
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:51,093
SAYING, I DON'T THINK WE NEED

774
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:51,833
TO BE SUPPORTING THAT LIFESTYLE

775
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,133
WITH GOVERNMENT MONEY.

776
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,633
WHICH IS NOT JUST AN OBVIOUS

777
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,300
ATTEMPT TO STIGMATIZE, IT ALSO

778
00:19:57,366 --> 00:19:59,000
IGNORES THAT DRUGS ARE ACTUALLY

779
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:02,900
HELPFUL IN SOME JOBS.

780
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:03,600
LIKE, FOR INSTANCE, THIS ONE.

781
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,776
HOW DO YOU THINK I TALK THIS

782
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,366
FAST ABOUT THINGS THIS

783
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:06,200
DEPRESSING?

784
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:07,033
WHAT DO YOU EVEN THINK THIS

785
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:07,866
WHITE VOID IS MADE OUT OF?

786
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:09,300
I'M SURROUNDED BY WEAPONS-GRADE

787
00:20:09,366 --> 00:20:11,933
COCAINE.

788
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,866
AND IT WASN'T JUST TENNESSEE...

789
00:20:13,933 --> 00:20:15,066
LOTS OF STATES PUT IN NEW,

790
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:16,066
ONEROUS REQUIREMENTS, TO MAKE

791
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,333
SURE THAT PEOPLE GETTING

792
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,266
BENEFITS "DESERVED" THEM.

793
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,533
FOR INSTANCE, NEBRASKA STARTED

794
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,766
REQUIRING FIVE "WORK SEARCH"

795
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,600
ACTIVITIES PER WEEK, WHICH COULD

796
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,833
INCLUDE ATTENDING A RESUME

797
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,333
WRITING CLASS OR TAKING

798
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,566
A CIVIL SERVICE EXAM,

799
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:29,633
BUT AT LEAST TWO OF WHICH

800
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:30,600
HAD TO BE APPLICATIONS FOR

801
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,500
SUITABLE WORK.

802
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:34,300
BUT IF THERE AREN'T TWO SUITABLE

803
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,266
WORK OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU TO

804
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,409
APPLY FOR THAT WEEK, YOU'RE SHIT

805
00:20:36,433 --> 00:20:38,400
OUT OF LUCK.

806
00:20:38,466 --> 00:20:39,966
AND THE PROBLEM IS, EACH

807
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:41,766
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT LIKE THAT

808
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:42,766
INCREASES THE CHANCES THAT

809
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:43,733
SOMEONE'S GOING TO MAKE A

810
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,942
MISTAKE, OR FAIL TO CHECK A BOX,

811
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:46,600
AND GET DENIED BENEFITS THEY

812
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:47,733
NEED.

813
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,233
AND AS THEY WERE DOING THIS,

814
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:49,866
STATES WERE ALSO AGGRESSIVELY

815
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:50,966
TARGETING FRAUD.

816
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:51,666
WHICH ISN'T, IN ITSELF,

817
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:52,966
A BAD IDEA.

818
00:20:53,033 --> 00:20:55,233
STATES DO LOSE MONEY TO FRAUD.

819
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,200
BEFORE THE PANDEMIC HIT, IT

820
00:20:57,266 --> 00:20:58,376
WASN'T A LOT... AN AVERAGE OF

821
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,566
3%.

822
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,266
BUT THAT ACTUALLY SURGED LAST

823
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,866
YEAR, WHEN ORGANIZED CRIMINALS

824
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:05,566
TARGETED UNEMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS,

825
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:07,300
AND CALIFORNIA ALONE SAID IT

826
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:14,600
LOST $11 BILLION.

827
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:15,466
BUT THE THING IS,

828
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:16,633
YOU HAVE TO BE VERY PRECISE

829
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,800
IN HOW YOU GO AFTER FRAUD.

830
00:21:17,866 --> 00:21:19,009
BECAUSE IF A CLAIM IS WRONGLY

831
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:21,100
FLAGGED, IT CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY

832
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:21,666
DELAYED, AND INNOCENT PEOPLE

833
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:23,833
THEN GET HURT.

834
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,066
THAT IS SOMETHING KENTUCKY'S

835
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:25,700
GOVERNOR RECENTLY FOUND WHEN HE

836
00:21:25,766 --> 00:21:26,600
SHARED WHAT HE CLEARLY THOUGHT

837
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:27,709
WAS A PRETTY FLAGRANT EXAMPLE.

838
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:28,500
WE HAD SOMEONE APPLY FOR

839
00:21:28,566 --> 00:21:30,000
UNEMPLOYMENT FOR TUPAC SHAKUR

840
00:21:30,066 --> 00:21:31,433
HERE IN KENTUCKY.

841
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,609
AND THAT PERSON PROBABLY THOUGHT

842
00:21:32,633 --> 00:21:33,200
THEY WERE BEING FUNNY.

843
00:21:33,266 --> 00:21:34,966
THEY PROBABLY DID.

844
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:36,700
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT,

845
00:21:36,766 --> 00:21:38,166
BECAUSE OF THEM, WE'VE GOTTA GO

846
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:39,400
THROUGH SO MANY OTHER CLAIMS.

847
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:44,566
OKAY.

848
00:21:44,633 --> 00:21:45,400
HE MADE A VERY CONFIDENT,

849
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:46,033
PUBLIC EXAMPLE OF

850
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,900
THAT, BECAUSE HE KNEW: NO ONE

851
00:21:46,966 --> 00:21:47,600
COULD BE CALLED TUPAC SHAKUR,

852
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,500
RIGHT?

853
00:21:49,566 --> 00:21:50,576
THAT IS JUST NOT A NAME PEOPLE

854
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:50,866
HAVE.

855
00:21:50,933 --> 00:21:51,600
EXCEPT, OF COURSE, FAMOUSLY,

856
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:52,600
THIS GUY BUT WE ALL KNOW, HE'S

857
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:53,809
LIVING IN THE FALKLAND ISLANDS

858
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:54,033
RIGHT NOW.

859
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,966
NO ONE ELSE COULD HAVE THAT

860
00:21:55,033 --> 00:21:57,700
NAME.

861
00:21:57,766 --> 00:21:58,966
IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE.

862
00:21:59,033 --> 00:21:59,900
I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING

863
00:21:59,966 --> 00:22:00,766
NEXT.

864
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,166
I OWE SOMEBODY AN APOLOGY

865
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:05,000
TONIGHT.

866
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:07,266
LAST NIGHT, I SPENT A LITTLE BIT

867
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,633
OF TIME TALKING ABOUT FRAUDULENT

868
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,100
CLAIMS HOLDING US UP.

869
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,533
I MENTIONED AN INDIVIDUAL WHO

870
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,533
FILED IN THE NAME OF

871
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
TUPAC SHAKUR.

872
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:18,866
I DIDN'T KNOW, AND IT'S MY

873
00:22:18,933 --> 00:22:20,800
FAULT, THAT WE HAVE A KENTUCKIAN

874
00:22:20,866 --> 00:22:22,600
WHO GOES BY MALIK, WHOSE NAME IS

875
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:23,766
TUPAC SHAKUR.

876
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,533
I TALKED TO HIM ON THE PHONE

877
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,366
TODAY, I APOLOGIZED.

878
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:33,766
YEAH, I BET YOU DID.

879
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,033
AND I WILL SAY, THAT'S YET

880
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,800
ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT NOTHING

881
00:22:35,866 --> 00:22:36,633
GOOD CAN EVER COME FROM

882
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,742
A MIDDLE-AGED WHITE MAN KNOWING

883
00:22:37,766 --> 00:22:38,366
ANYTHING ABOUT RAP.

884
00:22:38,433 --> 00:22:39,433
PERIOD.

885
00:22:39,466 --> 00:22:40,233
WE JUST CAN'T HANDLE IT.

886
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:45,100
THAT'S HOW YOU GET MACKLEMORE.

887
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,000
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "HEY,

888
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,300
WHAT'S SO BAD ABOUT

889
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:49,633
MACKLEMORE?,"

890
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,500
YOU'RE VERY MUCH PART OF

891
00:22:50,566 --> 00:22:51,333
THE PROBLEM HERE.

892
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,440
AND SOME MISTAKES HAPPENED

893
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,133
ON A MUCH BIGGER SCALE.

894
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,476
MICHIGAN ROLLED OUT A NEW SYSTEM

895
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,400
IN 2013, WHICH FLAGGED TENS OF

896
00:22:55,466 --> 00:22:56,100
THOUSANDS OF CASES FOR FRAUD.

897
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,266
UNFORTUNATELY, A REVIEW

898
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:58,166
FOUR YEARS LATER FOUND IT HAD

899
00:22:58,233 --> 00:23:00,166
A 70% ERROR RATE.

900
00:23:00,233 --> 00:23:02,233
MEANING THEY'D FALSELY ACCUSED

901
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,200
MORE THAN 40,000 PEOPLE OF

902
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:05,376
FRAUDULENTLY CLAIMING BENEFITS,

903
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,266
AND HAD BEEN WRONGFULLY

904
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:08,266
RECOUPING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF

905
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:09,766
MONEY FROM MANY OF THEM.

906
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,066
AND THE PROBLEM WITH THE WORD

907
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:14,366
"RECOUP" THERE IS, IT SOUNDS

908
00:23:14,433 --> 00:23:16,033
KIND OF BLOODLESS, UNTIL YOU

909
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,733
REALIZE THAT THOSE PEOPLE WERE

910
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,500
REQUIRED TO REPAY THEIR BENEFITS

911
00:23:18,566 --> 00:23:20,966
AT A 400% PENALTY.

912
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,366
WHICH IS JUST BRUTAL.

913
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:23,766
IT'S LIKE A HOSPITAL MISTAKENLY

914
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,033
THINKING A PATIENT WROTE A BAD

915
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:27,466
CHECK, AND DECIDING TO "RECOUP"

916
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:28,100
THEIR FUCKING HIP REPLACEMENT.

917
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:29,600
HEY!

918
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:30,933
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG, AND

919
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,200
I REALLY NEEDED THAT!

920
00:23:33,266 --> 00:23:34,966
AND IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW ALL

921
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:36,666
OF THIS... POOR TECHNOLOGY, DEEP

922
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:38,900
BENEFIT CUTS, AND ABSURD

923
00:23:38,966 --> 00:23:40,233
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS... CAN

924
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,966
COME TOGETHER TO BREAK A VITAL

925
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:43,733
SOCIAL PROGRAM, LOOK NO FURTHER

926
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,300
THAN FLORIDA.

927
00:23:45,366 --> 00:23:47,933
AMERICA'S VESTIGIAL TAIL.

928
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,566
FLORIDA'S PREVIOUS GOVERNOR,

929
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:51,833
AND SLENDERMAN UNDERSTUDY

930
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,466
RICK SCOTT, TOOK A HATCHET

931
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:54,033
TO THE STATE'S PROGRAM

932
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,033
WHILE IN POWER.

933
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,309
WHEN HE WAS SWORN IN, EMPLOYERS

934
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,533
THAT YEAR PAID AN AVERAGE OF

935
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,433
$319 PER EMPLOYEE IN

936
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,800
UNEMPLOYMENT TAXES.

937
00:24:00,866 --> 00:24:02,566
BY THE TIME HE LEFT OFFICE,

938
00:24:02,633 --> 00:24:04,066
THEY WERE PAYING JUST $50 PER

939
00:24:04,133 --> 00:24:06,700
EMPLOYEE... THE LOWEST IN THE

940
00:24:06,766 --> 00:24:07,909
COUNTRY, AND LESS THAN ONE-FIFTH

941
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:09,500
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.

942
00:24:09,566 --> 00:24:11,366
AND TO BALANCE THOSE CUTS OUT...

943
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:12,866
AS SCOTT PROUDLY TOLD A

944
00:24:12,933 --> 00:24:15,000
CONFERENCE OF YOUNG REPUBLICANS

945
00:24:15,066 --> 00:24:16,900
IN 2019... HE FOUND WAYS TO KEEP

946
00:24:16,966 --> 00:24:18,233
A LOT OF FLORIDIANS OFF

947
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,633
UNEMPLOYMENT.

948
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,366
ABOUT 22 MILLION PEOPLE LIVE

949
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:24,366
IN FLORIDA.

950
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:26,500
HOW MANY PEOPLE TODAY, THROW OUT

951
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:27,866
A GUESS, HOW MANY PEOPLE WHEN I

952
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,466
LEFT OFFICE WERE ON UNEMPLOYMENT

953
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:30,833
BENEFITS?

954
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,433
TEN MILLION IS ONE.

955
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,533
ANYBODY ELSE?

956
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:43,233
61,000.

957
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:45,200
WOW, THAT IS SOME

958
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:46,466
NERVOUS APPLAUSE.

959
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:48,700
EVEN IN THAT ROOM, YOU CAN FEEL

960
00:24:48,766 --> 00:24:50,566
PEOPLE THINKING, "WAIT, 61,000?

961
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:52,933
OUT OF 22 MILLION?

962
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,400
OH, THAT FEELS WAY TOO LOW.

963
00:24:54,466 --> 00:24:57,100
IS WHAT HE DID TERRIBLE?

964
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:58,833
ARE WE ALL TERRIBLE?

965
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,033
AW, NEVER MIND, WE'RE

966
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,733
CLAPPING NOW.

967
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,033
OKAY, I DO FEEL BETTER WHEN WE

968
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,133
CLAP."

969
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,342
TO ACHIEVE THOSE NUMBERS, SCOTT

970
00:25:07,366 --> 00:25:08,476
EMPLOYED ALL THE TACTICS YOU'VE

971
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
SEEN.

972
00:25:09,566 --> 00:25:11,000
HE STARTED REQUIRING PEOPLE

973
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:11,766
DOCUMENT CONTACTS WITH FIVE

974
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,100
EMPLOYERS PER WEEK, REDUCED

975
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:14,100
TOTAL BENEFITS BY SLASHING

976
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:14,866
THE NUMBER OF WEEKS YOU COULD

977
00:25:14,933 --> 00:25:16,042
RECEIVE THEM, AND THREW IN SOME

978
00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:17,306
EXTRA OBSTACLES, LIKE REQUIRING

979
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:17,933
APPLICANTS TO COMPLETE A

980
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,266
45-QUESTION "SKILLS ASSESSMENT,"

981
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:21,613
TESTING THEIR READING, MATH, AND

982
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:24,933
RESEARCH SKILLS... A POLICY SO

983
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,566
CLEARLY MEANT TO IMPEDE ACCESS,

984
00:25:25,633 --> 00:25:26,266
THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR'S

985
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:27,100
CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION DETERMINED

986
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:27,933
IT VIOLATED FEDERAL

987
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,766
NONDISCRIMINATION LAW.

988
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,500
THE STATE ALSO FORCED EVERYONE

989
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:34,433
TO FILE ONLINE, AND ROLLED OUT

990
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,740
AN EXPENSIVE NEW CLAIMS SYSTEM,

991
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:36,300
WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY PLAGUED

992
00:25:36,366 --> 00:25:37,633
WITH GLITCHES.

993
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,500
AND DESPITE ALL OF HIS

994
00:25:39,566 --> 00:25:42,433
REASSURANCES AT THE TIME THAT

995
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,766
THEY'D BE FIXED, THEY CLEARLY

996
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,066
WEREN'T, BECAUSE THE SYSTEM

997
00:25:46,133 --> 00:25:47,500
CRASHED SO BADLY LAST YEAR, THEY

998
00:25:47,566 --> 00:25:48,709
HAD TO SUDDENLY SHIFT TO PAPER

999
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:50,466
APPLICATIONS... WHICH, IN THE

1000
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:51,466
MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC, BROUGHT A

1001
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:53,733
WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF PROBLEMS.

1002
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,266
IT WAS NEAR BEDLAM AT THE

1003
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:56,033
JOHN F. KENNEDY LIBRARY IN

1004
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,400
HIALEAH.

1005
00:25:57,466 --> 00:25:59,200
A CROWD IN UNCOMFORTABLY CLOSE

1006
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,409
QUARTERS SHOVED ITS WAY FORWARD

1007
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,900
WITH PEOPLE DESPERATE TO GET

1008
00:26:02,966 --> 00:26:04,133
THEIR HANDS ON ONE OF THESE,

1009
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,209
AN APPLICATION FOR UNEMPLOYMENT

1010
00:26:05,233 --> 00:26:06,500
BENEFITS.

1011
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:09,066
I AM SO SCARED.

1012
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:10,933
I'M SCARED FOR MY LIFE.

1013
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,166
JUST FOR AN APPLICATION.

1014
00:26:13,233 --> 00:26:14,133
YEAH, I'M SCARED FOR

1015
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,033
YOUR LIFE, TOO, JUST WATCHING

1016
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,533
THAT.

1017
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,033
AND IT'S A TESTAMENT TO BOTH

1018
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,233
THIS PANDEMIC AND FLORIDA'S

1019
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,766
RIDICULOUS SYSTEM THAT I FEEL

1020
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:21,942
THE SAME WHITE-KNUCKLE TERROR

1021
00:26:21,966 --> 00:26:23,333
WATCHING PEOPLE LINE UP FOR

1022
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,933
UNEMPLOYMENT APPLICATIONS AS

1023
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,100
I DO WHEN WATCHING A DAREDEVIL

1024
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:28,033
JUMP A MOTORCYCLE OVER A ROW OF

1025
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,166
BUSES.

1026
00:26:29,233 --> 00:26:30,800
ALTHOUGH, TO BE HONEST, IT'S

1027
00:26:30,866 --> 00:26:31,633
PROBABLY ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

1028
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,942
BEFORE FLORIDA MAKES BUS-JUMPING

1029
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,333
A REQUIREMENT FOR APPLYING FOR

1030
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,066
UNEMPLOYMENT THERE, TOO.

1031
00:26:36,133 --> 00:26:38,000
AND WHILE YOU COULD ARGUE THAT

1032
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:39,666
THIS WAS JUST INCOMPETENCE,

1033
00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:40,966
YOU COULD ALSO ARGUE IT WAS

1034
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,466
COMPLETELY DELIBERATE.

1035
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:43,800
MANY FLORIDIANS ACTUALLY

1036
00:26:43,866 --> 00:26:45,400
SUGGESTED THAT LAST YEAR, ONE OF

1037
00:26:45,466 --> 00:26:48,533
WHOM WAS RICK SCOTT'S SUCCESSOR.

1038
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,966
I THINK THE GOAL WAS FOR

1039
00:26:50,033 --> 00:26:51,500
WHOEVER DESIGNED IT WAS, LET'S

1040
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:52,966
PUT AS MANY KIND OF POINTLESS

1041
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:54,733
ROADBLOCKS ALONG THE WAY SO

1042
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,733
PEOPLE JUST SAY, "OH, THE HELL

1043
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,100
WITH IT.

1044
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:58,300
I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT."

1045
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,633
BUT I THINK DEFINITELY IN TERMS

1046
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,066
OF HOW IT WAS INTERNALLY

1047
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:03,266
CONSTRUCTED, YOU KNOW, IT WAS

1048
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:04,900
DEFINITELY DONE IN A WAY TO LEAD

1049
00:27:04,966 --> 00:27:05,976
TO THE LEAST NUMBER OF... OF

1050
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,900
CLAIMS BEING PAID OUT.

1051
00:27:06,966 --> 00:27:08,433
WOW.

1052
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,740
I GOTTA SAY, IT'S WEIRD TO HEAR

1053
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,080
THIS ASSHOLE ACCURATELY CRITIQUE

1054
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:12,533
THIS ASSHOLE.

1055
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,300
IT'D BE LIKE HEARING

1056
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:15,526
"TWITTER REALLY NEEDS TO TAKE

1057
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:16,400
CARE OF ITS NAZI PROBLEM" FROM

1058
00:27:16,466 --> 00:27:17,600
MARK ZUCKERBERG.

1059
00:27:17,666 --> 00:27:19,266
SURE, IN ISOLATION, YOU'RE

1060
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,566
MAKING A GOOD POINT.

1061
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:21,966
YOU JUST HAPPEN TO BE A

1062
00:27:22,033 --> 00:27:25,033
FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED MESSENGER.

1063
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,466
BECAUSE BEFORE YOU GIVE DESANTIS

1064
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:28,333
TOO MUCH CREDIT THERE, IT'S

1065
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,433
WORTH KNOWING A STATE

1066
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,533
INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT

1067
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,766
AUDITORS HAD FLAGGED PROBLEMS

1068
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:36,100
WITH FLORIDA'S SYSTEM IN 2015,

1069
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:38,300
2016, AND 2019... AND NEITHER

1070
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:39,000
THE SCOTT NOR DESANTIS

1071
00:27:39,066 --> 00:27:39,966
ADMINISTRATIONS FIXED

1072
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,300
THE PROBLEMS.

1073
00:27:41,366 --> 00:27:42,966
AND FLORIDA'S DEEP AND

1074
00:27:43,033 --> 00:27:44,233
DELIBERATE NEGLECT OF ITS

1075
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,766
UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM CAUSED

1076
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:47,833
PEOPLE THERE REAL PAIN.

1077
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,233
IF THE UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIM

1078
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,533
FINALLY WENT THROUGH, WE'D BE

1079
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,633
ABLE TO PAY OUR BILLS NO

1080
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,800
PROBLEM.

1081
00:27:54,866 --> 00:27:56,400
BUT WE TRIED TO FILE FOR

1082
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,966
UNEMPLOYMENT ONLINE AND IT WAS

1083
00:27:59,033 --> 00:28:00,733
AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE.

1084
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,400
I CONSTANTLY HAVE A NAUSEOUS

1085
00:28:02,466 --> 00:28:04,833
FEELING IN MY STOMACH.

1086
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,200
I TRY TO DISTRACT MYSELF FROM

1087
00:28:07,266 --> 00:28:09,833
IT, BUT ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT...

1088
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,800
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T EVEN PUT IT

1089
00:28:10,866 --> 00:28:14,200
INTO WORDS.

1090
00:28:14,266 --> 00:28:15,733
I JUST... I DON'T WANT EMMETT TO

1091
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,500
SEE ME UPSET.

1092
00:28:17,566 --> 00:28:18,433
I'VE BEEN FIGHTING REALLY HARD

1093
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,033
TO HOLD IT TOGETHER.

1094
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,300
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

1095
00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:23,700
AND THE INFURIATING THING IS HOW

1096
00:28:23,766 --> 00:28:24,842
COMPLETELY PREVENTABLE IT IS.

1097
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:26,633
WE COULD HELP HER.

1098
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,533
IT'D BE BETTER FOR HER.

1099
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,600
IT'D ACTUALLY BE BETTER

1100
00:28:29,633 --> 00:28:31,300
FOR THE BROADER ECONOMY.

1101
00:28:31,366 --> 00:28:32,066
AND YET WE'RE ACTIVELY CHOOSING

1102
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:38,566
NOT TO DO IT.

1103
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,433
WHICH IS A FUCKING DISGRACE.

1104
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,266
SO HOW CAN WE FIX THIS SHIT

1105
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,200
GOING FORWARD?

1106
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:42,276
WELL, FIRST, THERE CAN NO LONGER

1107
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,066
BE ANY ARGUMENT THAT OUR CURRENT

1108
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:44,600
SYSTEM IS BROKEN.

1109
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:45,742
AGAIN, THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTIONS

1110
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,233
LAST YEAR... RAISING PAYMENTS,

1111
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,600
AND SCRAMBLING TO MAKE SURE THE

1112
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:50,600
SYSTEM COVERED MORE WORKERS...

1113
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:52,400
IS A PRETTY PUBLIC ADMISSION

1114
00:28:52,466 --> 00:28:54,000
THAT IT WAS FUCKED.

1115
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,700
SO NOW YOU'VE GOT TO FIX IT.

1116
00:28:55,766 --> 00:28:57,833
IN THE VERY SHORT TERM, STATES

1117
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,266
NEED FUNDING TO UPGRADE THEIR

1118
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:00,466
BROKEN TECHNOLOGY.

1119
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:01,733
THEY ALSO NEED TO REMOVE A LOT

1120
00:29:01,766 --> 00:29:03,600
OF THE STUPID OBSTACLES THAT

1121
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:04,742
PREVENT APPLICANTS WHO NEED HELP

1122
00:29:04,766 --> 00:29:06,533
FROM GETTING IT.

1123
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,666
BUT IN THE LONG TERM, WE NEED

1124
00:29:08,733 --> 00:29:10,400
SOME BIG CHANGES.

1125
00:29:10,466 --> 00:29:12,233
MANY EXPERTS AGREE, IF THE U.S.

1126
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,800
GOT A DO-OVER, IT'D BE MUCH

1127
00:29:13,866 --> 00:29:15,500
BETTER TO GO WITH ONE FEDERAL

1128
00:29:15,566 --> 00:29:17,700
SYSTEM THAN 53 SEPARATE ONES.

1129
00:29:17,766 --> 00:29:19,900
SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY DO THAT.

1130
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,666
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT WOULD

1131
00:29:21,733 --> 00:29:22,933
STOP STATES FROM BEING ABLE TO

1132
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,633
SLASH THEIR PROGRAMS IN THE NAME

1133
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,300
OF BEING "PRO-BUSINESS," AND

1134
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:27,000
ENGAGING IN A RACE TO THE BOTTOM

1135
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:28,733
ON TAXES.

1136
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,066
BUT IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO

1137
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:31,466
FEDERALIZE... AND, AT THE

1138
00:29:31,533 --> 00:29:32,676
MOMENT, IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE NOT

1139
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,633
...CONGRESS SHOULD AT THE VERY

1140
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,733
LEAST BE SETTING A BASIC

1141
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,533
STANDARD FOR UNEMPLOYMENT

1142
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,642
BENEFITS THAT STATES CANNOT

1143
00:29:38,666 --> 00:29:40,266
DROP BELOW.

1144
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,100
ALL OF WHICH IS A LONG WAY OF

1145
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:43,406
SAYING THAT WE NEED TO TAKE ALL

1146
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:44,542
THE ENERGY WE'VE BEEN POURING IN

1147
00:29:44,566 --> 00:29:47,466
TO MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO

1148
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:49,066
DON'T DESERVE PAYMENTS DON'T GET

1149
00:29:49,133 --> 00:29:50,600
THEM, AND PUT AT LEAST AS MUCH

1150
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:52,233
ENERGY INTO MAKING SURE THAT

1151
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,633
PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEED THEM DO.

1152
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,500
AND TO NOT MAKE BIG CHANGES

1153
00:29:57,566 --> 00:29:59,233
AFTER THE FLAWS OF THIS SYSTEM

1154
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,033
HAVE BEEN SO BRUTALLY EXPOSED

1155
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,666
OVER THE LAST YEAR WOULD BE

1156
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,866
UNFORGIVABLE.

1157
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:06,366
AND IF WE DON'T FIX IT, WE'VE

1158
00:30:06,433 --> 00:30:07,233
GOT ABSOLUTELY NOBODY TO BLAME

1159
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,800
BUT OURSELVES.

1160
00:30:08,866 --> 00:30:11,966
AND, POSSIBLY, ELMO.

1161
00:30:12,033 --> 00:30:13,266
I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY HOW,

1162
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:14,576
BUT THE WHOLE THING DOES KIND OF

1163
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
SEEM LIKE HIS FAULT.

1164
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:16,633
AND NOW, THIS.

1165
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:22,766
AND NOW...

1166
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:23,300
RACHAEL RAY'S COMPLICATED

1167
00:30:23,366 --> 00:30:25,833
HISTORY WITH BAKING.

1168
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,566
I FIND MOST CHALLENGING ABOUT

1169
00:30:27,633 --> 00:30:29,433
COOKING IS THE DISCIPLINE OF

1170
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:29,666
BAKING.

1171
00:30:29,733 --> 00:30:30,842
MY OLDER SISTER IS VERY TALENTED

1172
00:30:30,866 --> 00:30:32,933
AT IT IT HAS BEEN SINCE SHE WAS

1173
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:33,733
A SMALL GIRL.

1174
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,066
IT WAS REALLY TRAUMATIC AND

1175
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,933
THEREFORE I DECIDED I HATE

1176
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,166
BAKING.

1177
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:39,566
MY SISTER IS A FABULOUS BAKER

1178
00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:41,633
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL, FOR MY

1179
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,600
MOM'S BIRTHDAY, I TRIED TO MAKE

1180
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:45,233
HER FAVORITE CAKE, A LEMON

1181
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,433
COTTAGE CAKE, A RECIPE FOR ME

1182
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,200
'50s.

1183
00:30:48,266 --> 00:30:49,833
I TIPTOED AROUND MY HOUSE AND

1184
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,100
THE SOX, THE CASE NEVER ROSE, I

1185
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:53,866
CRIED FOR HOURS.

1186
00:30:53,933 --> 00:30:55,500
I HAD NOTHING TO GIVE HER FOR MY

1187
00:30:55,566 --> 00:30:55,766
BIRTHDAY.

1188
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:57,833
MY SISTER IS THE BAKER IN THE

1189
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,200
FAMILY.

1190
00:30:58,266 --> 00:30:59,866
ONE CHRISTMAS, I MADE ALL THESE

1191
00:30:59,933 --> 00:31:01,833
COOKIES, THEY EACH HAD DIFFERENT

1192
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,800
PERSONALITY, AND THE TWO DOGS

1193
00:31:02,866 --> 00:31:04,466
CAME IN AND ATE THE WHOLE TRAY.

1194
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:07,200
THE DOG CAME IN, ATE ALL OF

1195
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:08,266
THEM.

1196
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:08,966
I AM A TERRIBLE BAKER.

1197
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,433
MY SISTER IS THE BAKER AND

1198
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,233
THE FAMILY.

1199
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,100
I HATE TO BAKER.

1200
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:16,033
MY SISTER IS THE DESIGNATED

1201
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,033
BAKER.

1202
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,233
BAKING MAKES ME GRUMPY.

1203
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,633
I TRIED TO BAKE COOKIES ONE

1204
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,466
YEAR, I WAS THE MOST MISERABLE

1205
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:22,366
PERSON, NOBODY WANTED TO BE

1206
00:31:22,433 --> 00:31:24,100
THERE ON CHRISTMAS BECAUSE I WAS

1207
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:25,233
THERE.

1208
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,400
I MADE SO MANY CHRISTMAS

1209
00:31:26,466 --> 00:31:27,866
COOKIES A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

1210
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:29,266
MY HUSBAND TRIED TO LEAVE ME IF

1211
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:30,466
I EVER DID IT AGAIN.

1212
00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:31,666
I SUCK AT BAKING.

1213
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:33,866
MY SISTER IS THE BAKER.

1214
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,466
I'M NOT A VERY GOOD BAKER.

1215
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:37,833
MY SISTER IS A BETTER BAKER.

1216
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,500
ME HERE THAT YOU NOT LOVE TO

1217
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:40,700
BAKE.

1218
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:42,300
DO YOU EVER COOK?

1219
00:31:42,366 --> 00:31:43,233
I BAKED.

1220
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,400
MY SISTER IS A FABULOUS BAKER

1221
00:31:45,466 --> 00:31:46,566
I AM SO ENVIOUS.

1222
00:31:46,633 --> 00:31:49,000
I'M A TERRIBLE BAKER.

1223
00:31:49,066 --> 00:31:50,900
MY SISTER IS A FABULOUS BAKER.

1224
00:31:50,966 --> 00:31:52,900
MY SISTER IS A BAKER.

1225
00:31:52,966 --> 00:31:54,366
MY SISTER IS A BAKER.

1226
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:56,900
I DON'T BAKE.

1227
00:31:56,966 --> 00:31:57,533
I HATE BAKING!

1228
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,800
THIS IS MY SISTER, THIS IS

1229
00:32:02,866 --> 00:32:04,200
MARIA.

1230
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:05,533
HELLO.

1231
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:12,433
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

1232
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,900
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

1233
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:16,400
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

1234
00:32:16,466 --> 00:32:16,700
GOOD NIGHT.

1235
00:32:17,366 --> 00:32:19,466
OH, NO, NO, NOT AGAIN.

1236
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:20,666
COME ON.

1237
00:32:20,733 --> 00:32:21,166
STOP IT.

1238
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:23,633
PLEASE, STOP IT.

1239
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,266
I REALLY DON'T WANT THE INTERNET

1240
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:27,966
TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS IMAGE.

1241
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:29,033
PLEASE STOP IT.

1242
00:32:30,166 --> 00:32:31,700
I WILL SAY THE SONG'S LAPSE.

1243
00:32:31,766 --> 00:32:32,766
THE SONG IS FINE.
