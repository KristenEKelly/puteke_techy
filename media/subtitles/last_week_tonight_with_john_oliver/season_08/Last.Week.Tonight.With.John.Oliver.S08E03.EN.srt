I ASSUME THEIR STATE MEDIA IS

00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,533
CLAIMING THAT THE VIRUS WAS

54
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,709
REPELLED FROM THE COUNTRY AFTER

55
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:50,942
KIM JONG-UN BREATHED FIRE ON IT.

THIS SCANDAL STEMS FROM A

57
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,966
DIRECTIVE CUOMO MADE LAST MARCH,

58
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:55,242
TELLING NURSING HOMES TO ACCEPT

59
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:56,366
COVID-POSITIVE PATIENTS

60
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:58,766
TO FREE UP HOSPITAL BEDS.

61
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,200
THAT WOULD BE BAD ENOUGH, BUT

62
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:01,442
SINCE THEN, HIS ADMINISTRATION

63
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:02,866
HAS TRIED TO DOWNPLAY ANY

64
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:04,333
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT ACTION...

65
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,100
RELEASING A REPORT LAST JULY

66
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,600

68
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:09,100

69
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,566

DATA ON COVID DEATHS OUT OF FEAR

72
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:15,733
IT'D BE USED AGAINST THEM BY

73
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,566
FEDERAL PROSECUTORS.

74
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:19,433
THAT REVELATION, UNDERSTANDABLY,

75
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,400
SET OFF A FIRESTORM.

76
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:21,366
AND AFTER A DEMOCRATIC

77
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,766
LEGISLATOR, RON KIM, MADE A

78
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,333
STATEMENT ABOUT IT TO THE PRESS,

79
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,476
HE SAYS HE GOT A CALL FROM CUOMO

80
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,400
THAT WENT ABOUT AS WELL AS YOU

81
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:28,900
MIGHT EXPECT.

82
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:31,533
THE GOVERNOR ASKED ME TO

83
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,166
ISSUE A STATEMENT THAT COUNTERED

84
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:38,133
WHAT I HEARD IN THE MEETING AND

85
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,233
ESSENTIALLY COVER UP THE

86
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,866
COVER-UP.

87
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:44,333
HE SPENT 10 MINUTES BERATING ME,

88
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,300
THREATENING ME TO END MY CAREER

89
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,666
IN FRONT OF MY FAMILY, IN FRONT

90
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:52,433
OF MY KIDS.

91
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,366
John: YEAH, NOT GREAT.

92
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:54,266
NOW, I HAVE TO SAY,

93
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,133
CUOMO HAS DENIED KIM'S ACCOUNT

94
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
OF THAT CALL.

95
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:57,342
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW, MANY, MANY

96
00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:58,200
PEOPLE WHO'VE DEALT WITH CUOMO

97
00:02:58,266 --> 00:02:59,100
IN THE PAST HAVE SAID IT SOUNDS

98
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,033
EXACTLY LIKE HIM.

99
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,300
AND THAT REPUTATION ALONE

100
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:03,166
GOES A LONG WAY.

101
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:04,600
BE HONEST, IF YOU SAW A HEADLINE

102
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,066
TOMORROW THAT SAID, "LEAKED MEMO

106
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,566
YOU'D BELIEVE IT.

107
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:14,433
EVEN IF I DENIED THE ACCOUNT OF

108
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,033
THAT CONVERSATION, DEEP DOWN,

109
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,142
YOU'D KNOW IT HAPPENED, BECAUSE

110
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:17,933
IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING

111
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,933
I'D DO.

112
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,433
AND CUOMO IS FAMOUSLY

113
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,000
UNPLEASANT.

114
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:23,300
HE REPORTEDLY HAS A

115
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:24,466
"DO-NOT-YELL-AT" LIST,

116
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:25,833
WHICH A FORMER AIDE APPARENTLY

117
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,133
ADMITTED IS VERY SMALL.

118
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,633
AND JUST THIS WEEK,

119
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,766
A DIFFERENT FORMER AIDE ACCUSED

120
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:35,633
HIM OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT,

121
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,766
A CLAIM HE DENIES.

122
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:37,666
ALTHOUGH, ON THE SAME DAY THAT

123
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:38,776
STORY BROKE, CUOMO WAS AT A

VACCINATING THIS STATE SENATOR.

127
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:42,733
I'M GOING TO BE DOING

128
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,866
THE VACCINATION.

129
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:45,700
I GET TO SELECT THE PART OF THE

130
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:51,300
ANATOMY WHERE I DO THE VACCINE.

131
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:52,500
AND YOU'LL BE SURPRISED, OR

132
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,633
MAYBE NOT, WHEN YOU SEE THE PART

133
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,000
OF THE ANATOMY THAT I PICK.

134
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:56,800
John: IS IT HIS PENIS,

135
00:03:56,866 --> 00:04:00,933
ANDREW?

136
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,566
ARE YOU GOING TO VACCINATE HIM

137
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:05,900
IN THE PENIS?

138
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:06,733
BECAUSE I'LL BE HONEST, I WOULD

139
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,633
ACTUALLY BE SURPRISED IF YOU

140
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,366
WANTED TO VACCINATE HIM IN THE

141
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:09,100
PENIS.

142
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:09,966
THE VEIN IS HARD TO FIND.

143
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:10,666
PRACTITIONERS GENERALLY

144
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:11,809
RECOMMEND THE NON-DOMINANT ARM

145
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:12,500
AND ALSO, WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG

146
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:13,033
WITH YOU?

147
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,100
EVEN BEFORE THE CURRENT

148
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,033
SCANDALS, THERE WAS SOMETHING

149
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,633
GROSS ABOUT CUOMO'S GLEE IN HIS

150
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,033
PUBLIC ADULATION LAST YEAR,

151
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,700
FROM HIS CONSTANT APPEARANCES

152
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:20,500
WITH HIS BROTHER ON CNN,

153
00:04:20,566 --> 00:04:22,366
TO HIM CO-SIGNING ON THE TERM

154
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:23,566
"CUOMOSEXUALS"... THE ONLY

155
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:27,166
SEXUAL ORIENTATION, BY THE WAY,

156
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,766
IT'S COMPLETELY ACCEPTABLE TO

157
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:29,900
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST.

158
00:04:29,966 --> 00:04:31,200
TO THE BOOK HE PUBLISHED LAST

159
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:32,066
OCTOBER ABOUT THE LESSONS

160
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:33,209
HE'D LEARNED FROM HANDLING THE

161
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:33,666
STILL-ONGOING PANDEMIC,

162
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:35,600
WHICH WERE PRESUMABLY:

163
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:36,400
"1: DO PRESS CONFERENCES."

164
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:37,800
"2: THE END."

165
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:39,400
AND THOSE PRESS CONFERENCES

166
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:41,533
WHERE CUOMO LOVED TO INSIST ON

167
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,566
THE IMPORTANCE OF FACTS NOW PLAY

168
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:45,700
A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY, AFTER

169
00:04:45,766 --> 00:04:46,766
EVERYTHING WE'VE LEARNED.

170
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,133
ESPECIALLY MOMENTS LIKE THIS.

171
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,309
"FOLLOW THE FACTS, THEY WILL

172
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,133
SHOW YOU THE WAY,"

173
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,533
A.J. PARKINSON.

174
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,633
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN

175
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,100
NEW YORK, FOLLOWING THE FACTS.

176
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,133
John: OKAY, THE THING IS,

177
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,933
IT'S HARD TO FOLLOW THE FACTS

178
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,276
IF THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF THOSE

179
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,000
FACTS ARE ACTIVELY WITHHOLDING

180
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:04,933
THEM FROM YOU.

181
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,166
AS FAR AS ADVICE GOES, THAT'S

182
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:07,033
BASICALLY AS USEFUL AS A BULLY

183
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,276
SAYING "STOP HITTING YOURSELF,"

184
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,433
IN THAT IN BOTH CASES, YEAH,

185
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,333
I'D ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE TO.

186
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,233
THE THING IS, SOME ASSHOLE WON'T

187
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:14,766

374
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,933
I'LL GIVE YOU ALL THE SERVICE

375
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,833
AND NO DAMN FUSS.

376
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,433
GIVE THE BABY MERCHANT

377
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,000
JUST A WEEK OR TWO.

378
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:06,000
I'LL HAVE A BABY FOR YOU.

379
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:07,266
John: THAT SONG IS THREE

380
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,666
MINUTES LONG AND THEY NEVER DO

381
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,033
ANYTHING ELSE.

382
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,260
THAT COUPLE JUST STANDS THERE

383
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,833
WHILE A MAN INFORMS THEM THAT

384
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,633
HE'S THE BABY MERCHANT FOR

385
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,233
THREE HUMAN MINUTES.

386
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,200
THAT SHOW WAS ON TELEVISION

387
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:18,766
IN AMERICA.

388
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,000
BUT AS LONG AS WE'VE BEEN

389
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:21,200
QUESTIONING ON TV WHETHER

390
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:21,833
POLICING HAS... AND I APOLOGIZE

391
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:26,533
FOR EVEN ATTEMPTING THIS...

392
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,633
"RACIAL OVERTONES," WE'VE MADE

393
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,466
VERY LITTLE PROGRESS TOWARDS

394
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:31,933
ACTUALLY ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE.

395
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,600
AS WE'VE DISCUSSED BEFORE,

396
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,876
THE PAST AND PRESENT OF POLICING

397
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,076
IN AMERICA IS VERY MUCH TIED UP

398
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,966
WITH RACISM.

399
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:38,466
AND WE WANT TO FOCUS ON ONE AREA

400
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:40,066
OF POLICING IN PARTICULAR

401
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:41,200
TONIGHT: POLICE RAIDS.

402
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,833
IT'S A PRACTICE THAT ATTRACTED

403
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,140
A LOT OF ATTENTION LAST YEAR IN

404
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,033
THE WAKE OF THE BREONNA TAYLOR

405
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,866
CASE.

406
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:47,076
SHE WAS KILLED AFTER OFFICERS

407
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,166
BROKE DOWN HER DOOR IN THE

408
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:49,666
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND

409
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,500
FIRED 32 SHOTS INTO HER HOME.

410
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:53,133
A YEAR LATER, NONE OF THESE

411
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,440
OFFICERS HAVE BEEN INDICTED FOR

412
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:56,000
CHARGES RELATING TO HER DEATH.

413
00:10:56,066 --> 00:10:57,833
AND IF IT IS SOMEHOW NOBODY'S

414
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,009
FAULT THAT AN INNOCENT WOMAN

415
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,109
WAS KILLED IN THE MIDDLE OF

416
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:01,866
THE NIGHT IN HER OWN HOME,

417
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:03,009
THERE MIGHT BE AN ISSUE WITH

418
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:06,366
POLICE RAIDS.

419
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:07,609
DATA ON THEM IS SCARCE, SO IT'S

420
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,266
HARD TO SAY HOW MANY TAKE PLACE

421
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,409
IN AMERICA, BUT ESTIMATES PUT

422
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:11,933
IT IN THE TENS OF THOUSANDS

423
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
PER YEAR.

424
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:14,733
AND THEY CAN BE CARRIED OUT BY

425
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,500
ALMOST ANYONE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT

426
00:11:16,566 --> 00:11:17,800
...FROM FEDERAL AGENTS, TO

427
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:18,666
S.W.A.T. TEAMS WITHIN POLICE

428
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:20,200
DEPARTMENTS, TO DETECTIVES,

429
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:20,833
AND PATROL OFFICERS.

430
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,366
AND WHILE THESE TACTICS WERE

431
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:24,033
INITIALLY INTENDED FOR

432
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,400
LIFE-OR-DEATH SCENARIOS, LIKE

433
00:11:25,466 --> 00:11:26,266
ACTIVE SHOOTERS OR HOSTAGE

434
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,800
SITUATIONS, ONE ANALYSIS FOUND

435
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:29,966
THAT ONLY 7% OF SWAT DEPLOYMENTS

436
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:32,533
MET THAT CRITERIA, WHILE MORE

437
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
THAN 60% OF THE CASES INVOLVED

438
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,833
SEARCHES FOR DRUGS.

439
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,433
AND THAT SHIFT WAS THE RESULT OF

440
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,900
INTENTIONAL POLICY CHOICES.

441
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,300
POLICE RAIDS WERE SUPERCHARGED

442
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:43,900
BY THE WAR ON DRUGS, AND THE

443
00:11:43,966 --> 00:11:45,533
TACTIC BECAME SO POPULAR THAT

444
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,933
GERALDO RIVERA EVEN PRODUCED

445
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,466
A SPECIAL WHERE HE SHOWED YOU

446
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:51,066
RAIDS HAPPEN IN REAL TIME.

447
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:52,500
THIS IS REAL LIFE, THE FIRST

448
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:53,866
IN A SERIES OF RAIDS WE'LL BE

449
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:55,166
SHOWING YOU THIS EVENING.

450
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:57,500
IN THIS ONE, MEMBERS OF THE

451
00:11:57,566 --> 00:12:00,033
SAN DIEGO POLICE DEPARTMENT ARE

452
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,266
RAIDING A SO-CALLED CRACK HOUSE,

453
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,100
WHERE PUSHERS SELL COCAINE TO

454
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,900
PEOPLE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

455
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:06,800
FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS, WE HAVE

456
00:12:06,866 --> 00:12:08,500
COVERED THE STREET COPS WHOSE

457
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:11,600
JOB IS TO RIP AND TEAR AND POUND

458
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:12,166
THEIR WAY INTO THE NATION'S

459
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:12,766
CRACK-HOUSES AND SHOOTING

460
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,600
GALLERIES.

461
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,233
AND WE HAVE GONE UNDERCOVER TO

462
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:16,866
EXPOSE THE PUSHERS WHO PROFIT

463
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:18,733
FROM THIS DIRTY BUSINESS.

464
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,133
John: WOW.

465
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,800
THEY ALL SEEM TO BE HAVING FUN

466
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:23,800
THERE, FROM THE OFFICERS'

467
00:12:23,866 --> 00:12:25,133
MAD DASH LIKE IT'S BLACK FRIDAY

468
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
AND WALMART HAS A SALE ON

469
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:29,266
MARIJUANA, TO GERALDO'S

470
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,376
RIDICULOUS DISGUISE, WHICH LOOKS

471
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,466
LIKE THE PRINGLES GUY

472
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:32,833
AUDITIONING FOR "MIAMI VICE."

473
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,400
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, THAT'S

474
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:35,509
STILL BETTER THAN HIS CURRENT

475
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:36,933
LOOK, WHICH ANSWERS THE

476
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,766
QUESTION, WHAT IF EVERY SINGLE

477
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,666
"BATMAN" JOKER WERE ROLLED INTO

478
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:40,833
ONE?

479
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,133
AND RAIDS CAN OBVIOUSLY HAVE

480
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,166
DIRE CONSEQUENCES.

481
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:45,766
A "TIMES" INVESTIGATION FOUND

482
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,000
THAT, FROM 2010 TO 2016,

483
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,666
AT LEAST 81 CIVILIANS WERE

484
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:50,366
KILLED IN THEM.

485
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:52,000
AND THESE TACTICS ARE RARELY

486
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:53,266
PROPORTIONAL TO THE ALLEGED

487
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,566
CRIMES BEING TARGETED.

488
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:56,433
IN LOUISVILLE, BREONNA TAYLOR'S

489
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,533
HOME, A YEAR AND A HALF BEFORE

490
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,200
THE RAID THAT KILLED HER, THIS

491
00:12:59,266 --> 00:13:01,200
HAPPENED.

492
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:02,509
THIS POLICE BODY CAMERA VIDEO

493
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:03,933
SHOWS LMPD SWAT OFFICERS

494
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,666
BREAKING INTO DAUGHERTY AND

495
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:05,842
BURR'S HOUSE ON WEST CHESTNUT

496
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:06,733
STREET.

497
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,566
HURRY UP, COME ON, PUT YOUR

498
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:08,933
HANDS UP!

499
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,266
THE COUPLE AND THEIR THREE

500
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,033
CHILDREN, WHO WERE UNDER THE AGE

501
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,733
OF 16 AT THE TIME, CLAIM THEY

502
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,466
WERE HELD AT GUNPOINT THE

503
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:17,966
MORNING OF OCTOBER 26TH, 2018.

504
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:18,900
17 SWAT OFFICERS BURST IN

505
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,133
BECAUSE A DETECTIVE SMELLED

506
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,500
MARIJUANA COMING FROM THE

507
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:22,266
FAMILY'S HOME.

508
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,400
John: HE "SMELLED MARIJUANA."

509
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:26,466
COME ON!

510
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:28,500
IF YOU JUST "SMELL MARIJUANA,"

511
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:29,233
YOU DON'T SHOW UP WITH LOADED

512
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,376
ASSAULT RIFLES LIKE YOU'RE IN

513
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
"CALL OF DUTY."

514
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:32,866
YOU SHOW UP WITH

515
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:34,100
"SETTLERS OF CATAN" AND $50

516
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,733
WORTH OF COOKIES FROM SUBWAY.

517
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,266
DON'T BE SUCH FUCKING SQUARES.

518
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,633
AND THE THING IS, ABSURDLY

519
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,633
DISPROPORTIONATE AND DANGEROUS

520
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,266
RESPONSES ARE BASICALLY PAR FOR

521
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,833
THE COURSE WHEN IT COMES TO

522
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,166
POLICE RAIDS.

523
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:47,566
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

524
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:48,633
THEM... WHY THEY'RE SUCH

525
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,833
A FAVORED TOOL OF POLICE,

526
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,133
WHY THEY REALLY SHOULDN'T BE,

527
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,100
AND WHAT WE SHOULD DO ABOUT

528
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,066
THAT.

529
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:54,566
AND LET'S START WITH WHAT YOU

530
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,533
PROBABLY KNOW ALREADY, WHICH IS

531
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,966
THAT NOT ALL OF US ARE AT EQUAL

532
00:13:58,033 --> 00:14:00,266
DANGER OF BEING RAIDED.

533
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,442
WHEN CBS 2 IN CHICAGO DID AN

534
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,676
INVESTIGATION OF SEVERAL YEARS'

535
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,033
WORTH OF SEARCH WARRANTS,

536
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,266
THEY FOUND THAT CERTAIN

537
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,700
NEIGHBORHOODS TENDED TO BE HIT

538
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:08,533
A LOT MORE OFTEN THAN OTHERS.

539
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,866
ENGLEWOOD HAD 872

540
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,766
SEARCH WARRANTS.

541
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,533
ALSO IN THE TOP FIVE

542
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,566
NEIGHBORHOODS ARE AUSTIN

543
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:19,166
WITH 668, NORTH LAWNDALE, 455,

544
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,800
GARFIELD PARK, 442, AND

545
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:23,500
HUMBOLDT PARK WITH 376.

546
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:24,666
CENSUS DATA SHOWS THESE

547
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:25,533
NEIGHBORHOODS ARE ALL NEARLY

548
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,633
90% OR MORE BLACK AND LATINO.

549
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,766
WE FOUND ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE

550
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,266
HAPPEN IN WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS

551
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,866
AND NONE LISTED FOR EDISON PARK,

552
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:34,266
PRINTERS ROW, WRIGLEYVILLE,

553
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,200
MUSEUM CAMPUS,

554
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:37,200
AND MAGNIFICENT MILE.

555
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:40,866
John: YEAH, THAT'S ABOUT

556
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:42,600
AS FUCKED AS YOU'D EXPECT.

557
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:43,200
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, YOU DIDN'T

558
00:14:43,266 --> 00:14:43,833
HAVE TO TELL ME THOSE

559
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,633
NEIGHBORHOODS ARE

560
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,366
PREDOMINANTLY WHITE.

561
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:48,433
BECAUSE EDISON PARK,

562
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,133
MUSEUM CAMPUS, AND

563
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,000
MAGNIFICENT MILE ARE SOME OF

564
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:50,800
THE WHITEST SOUNDING PLACE NAMES

565
00:14:50,866 --> 00:14:51,866
I'VE EVER HEARD.

566
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,833
RIGHT UP THERE WITH ALABASTER

567
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,900
PRIM, SPF-50-VILLE, AND VERMONT.

568
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:56,400
AND THAT RACIAL DISPARITY

569
00:14:56,466 --> 00:14:58,100
HAS BEEN FOUND AGAIN AND AGAIN.

570
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,400
IN LOUISVILLE, AN EXAMINATION

571
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,400
FOUND SEARCH WARRANTS

572
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:03,033
DISPROPORTIONATELY TARGETED

573
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,633
BLACK RESIDENTS, AND A STUDY

574
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,766
OF ONE YEAR OF WARRANTS IN

575
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:07,942
WASHINGTON, D.C. FOUND THEY WERE

576
00:15:07,966 --> 00:15:09,109
ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY EXECUTED IN

577
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:10,633
BLACK COMMUNITIES.

578
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,980
AND POLICE HAVE BEEN GIVEN TOOLS

579
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:13,433
TO CARRY OUT THOSE WARRANTS WITH

580
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,400
INCREASING FORCE.

581
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:16,200
POLICE DEPARTMENTS HAVE BECOME

582
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:17,166
HEAVILY MILITARIZED AFTER EITHER

583
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:18,600
PURCHASING OR JUST BEING HANDED

584
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:19,900
MILITARY EQUIPMENT.

585
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:21,800
AND SOME DON'T EVEN TRY TO HIDE

586
00:15:21,866 --> 00:15:23,200
HOW MUCH THEY ENJOY USING IT.

587
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:25,533
JUST LISTEN TO THIS OFFICER

588
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,166
INTRODUCE ONE OF HIS TOYS IN A

589
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:29,566
CAREER DAY LIVESTREAM FOR KIDS.

590
00:15:29,633 --> 00:15:30,133
WE CALL THIS THE BIG BAD

591
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
WOLF.

592
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:33,533
BECAUSE WITH ENOUGH FORCE,

593
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,300
I CAN TAKE THIS RAM ON THE FRONT

594
00:15:35,366 --> 00:15:36,966
OF THIS VEHICLE AND I CAN PUT IT

595
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:37,600
AGAINST A BRICK HOUSE AND I CAN

596
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:38,776
GO RIGHT THROUGH THAT BRICK.

597
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,466
AND I CAN COME RIGHT IN

598
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:41,400
YOUR HOUSE IF I NEED TO.

599
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:42,566
NOT YOUR HOUSE, BECAUSE ALL

600
00:15:42,633 --> 00:15:45,466
OF YOU ARE GOOD KIDS.

601
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:47,566
WE ONLY DO IT FOR THE BAD KIDS.

602
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:51,033
John: OH, YOU DO, DO YOU?

603
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,266
WELL, THAT'S REASSURING.

604
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:52,866
WE'VE CERTAINLY GOT NO REASON

605
00:15:52,933 --> 00:15:54,009
NOT TO TRUST YOU TO DETERMINE

606
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:55,176
WHO'S A GOOD KID AND A BAD KID.

607
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,400
YOU'RE JUST A NICE, TALKATIVE

608
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:57,642
GUY WHO, APPARENTLY, ROOTS FOR

609
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,100
THE WOLF IN THE STORY OF THE

610
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,666
THREE LITTLE PIGS.

611
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:02,366
"IF ONLY THE WOLF HAD POSSESSED

612
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:03,473
MILITARY GRADE EQUIPMENT,"

613
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,300
YOU SAY AS YOU TUCK YOUR

614
00:16:04,366 --> 00:16:05,433
CHILDREN IN AT NIGHT.

615
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,580
"FORTUNATELY, YOUR GOD-LIKE

616
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:07,433
FATHER HAS NO SUCH LIMITATIONS

617
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,733
ON HIS POWERS.

618
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,033
SLEEP TIGHT, GOOD KIDS!"

619
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,366
NOW, THERE ARE IMPORTANT

620
00:16:13,433 --> 00:16:14,833
QUESTIONS OVER WHETHER OR NOT

621
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,266
POLICE OFFICERS REALLY NEED

622
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,333
ACCESS TO THAT KIND OF

623
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:18,066
EQUIPMENT, JUST AS THERE ARE

624
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:18,966
QUESTIONS OVER WHAT MESSAGES

625
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:20,400
THEY TAKE AWAY FROM SOME OF

626
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:22,066
THE TRAINING THEY RECEIVE.

627
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:23,373
TAKE A LOOK AT ONE PARTICULARLY

628
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,400
EXTREME EXERCISE FOR

629
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:27,800
S.W.A.T. TEAM MEMBERS.

630
00:16:27,866 --> 00:16:28,700
THE CULT LEADER REALIZES

631
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:29,400
THAT THEY GOT AN ARMORED VEHICLE

632
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:31,233
GOING TO START.

633
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,700
HE GOES, OKAY, LET'S PULL

634
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:33,500
THE TRIGGER, SENDS OUT THE RPG,

635
00:16:33,566 --> 00:16:34,433
AND THEN THEY START EXECUTING

636
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:34,866
PEOPLE.

637
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:36,366
OH, MY GOD.

638
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:37,576
IT'S REALLY A MASS SUICIDE.

639
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,066
BUT IN FACT, IT'S REALLY A

640
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:40,300
MURDER SUICIDE.

641
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,800
NONE OF THE SCENARIOS WE SAW

642
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:43,900
LEFT MUCH ROOM FOR NONVIOLENT

643
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:44,633
SOLUTIONS.

644
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,300
AND THEN BACK IN HERE,

645
00:16:48,366 --> 00:16:49,666
THE CULT LEADERS BASICALLY

646
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:50,400
SYSTEMATICALLY EXECUTING BABIES.

647
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:51,100
SHOW ME YOUR HANDS,

648
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,000
SHOW ME YOUR HANDS!

649
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:53,500
WHEN THE AMOUNT OF HOURS

650
00:16:53,566 --> 00:16:54,806
YOU SPEND AT THE SHOOTING RANGE

651
00:16:54,866 --> 00:16:56,133
OUTNUMBER THE NUMBER OF HOURS

652
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,833
YOU SPEND LEARNING CONFLICT

653
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,166
RESOLUTION BY, YOU KNOW,

654
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:01,100
10 OR 15 TO ONE, YOU'RE GOING TO

655
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:01,733
BE MORE LIKELY TO USE THE TOOL

656
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,900
THAT YOU'VE TRAINED MORE WITH.

657
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:07,533
John: YEAH, NO SHIT!

658
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,066
BECAUSE LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING

659
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:10,276
THEY SHOULDN'T BE PREPARED FOR

660
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:10,733
CULT LEADER BABY MURDER.

661
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,400
BUT HOW MANY CULT LEADER

662
00:17:11,466 --> 00:17:12,133
BABY MURDERS DO THEY THINK

663
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,000
THEY'RE GOING TO BE CALLED TO

664
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:13,633
EVERY YEAR?

665
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,166
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,

666
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:17,376
"BUT JOHN, IF THERE IS A BABY

667
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,409
MURDER CULT, HOW ARE WE GOING

668
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:19,476
TO REPLACE ALL THOSE BABIES?"

669
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,333
DON'T WORRY.

670
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,133
I'M PRETTY SURE I KNOW A GUY

671
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:29,200
WHO CAN HELP.

672
00:17:29,766 --> 00:17:30,300
I'M THE BABY MERCHANT!

673
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:30,900
TOTS 'R' US.

674
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:31,833
John: SERIOUSLY.

675
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,966
IT'S THREE MINUTES LONG.

676
00:17:33,033 --> 00:17:33,900
IT'S SO WEIRD.

677
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:34,766
I'M NOT SAYING YOU SHOULD SEEK

678
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,266
IT OUT, I'M JUST SAYING,

679
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:36,966
YOU DO NEED TO KNOW IT EXISTS.

680
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:38,142
THE OBVIOUS DANGER OF FOSTERING

681
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,242
A MILITARIZED POLICE CULTURE

682
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,133
THAT TRAINS AND EQUIPS OFFICERS

683
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,280
LIKE THEY'RE THE LEAD IN AN

684
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,376
ACTION MOVIE IS THAT IT CAN

685
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,166
ENCOURAGE THEM TO THEN ACT

686
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:44,500
THAT WAY.

687
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:45,733
TAKE A LOOK AT A RAID THAT

688
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,100
TOOK PLACE IN LITTLE ROCK.

689
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,100
HERE, THE POLICE BLOW OPEN THE

690
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,833
DOOR OF THE APARTMENT BELONGING

691
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,633
TO A MAN NAMED RODERICK TALLEY,

692
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,633
BECAUSE THEY FALSELY BELIEVED

693
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,866
HE WAS SELLING COCAINE.

694
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:56,333
BUT DESPITE NOT FINDING ANY,

695
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,800
WHEN THEY REALIZED HE HAD

696
00:17:57,866 --> 00:17:59,066
A HOME SECURITY CAMERA, THEY

697
00:17:59,133 --> 00:18:00,533
ASKED HIM... WHILE HE WAS STILL

698
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,966
CUFFED TO A CHAIR... IF THEY

699
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:02,833
COULD REWATCH THE FOOTAGE OF

700
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,066
THEIR RAID, SO THEY COULD SEE

701
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:05,266
HOW IT LOOKED.

702
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:05,966
THAT'S AWESOME, I'M GONNA

703
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:06,966
RECORD THAT REAL QUICK.

704
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:15,033
CAN YOU PLAY IT BACK AGAIN?

705
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:17,866
THAT WAS WORTH COMING TO WORK

706
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:18,266
FOR.

707
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,500
ONE MORE TIME.

708
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:20,400
WE AIN'T LAUGHING AT YOU,

709
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:24,433
THOUGH.

710
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,300
John: YEAH, DON'T WORRY,

711
00:18:25,366 --> 00:18:26,200
WE'RE NOT

712
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:27,066
LAUGHING AT YOU, WE'RE JUST

713
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:27,733
HIGH-FIVING OURSELVES FOR

714
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,500
HOW COOL IT LOOKED WHEN WE BLEW

715
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,000
YOUR DOOR IN.

716
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:29,800
BUT YOU GET IT!

717
00:18:29,866 --> 00:18:30,533
YOU WERE THERE!

718
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,266
BY THE WAY, THANKS FOR BEING

719
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,133
SUCH A GOOD SPORT ABOUT THIS,

720
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,766
EVEN THOUGH WE DO ALL HAVE GUNS

721
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:33,842
SO YOU KIND OF HAVE TO BE!

722
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:36,033
THIS JOB IS FUN!

723
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,100
AND POLICE MIGHT TELL YOU THAT,

724
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,733
THEY DON'T JUST USE GUNS, THEY

725
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,133
ALSO HAVE SUPPOSEDLY NONLETHAL

726
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,366
TOOLS OUT THERE TO EXPOSURE.

727
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:48,266
BUT EVEN THEN, THERE CAN BE

728
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:48,500
ISSUES.

729
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:49,266
TAKE FLASHBANG GRENADES.

730
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,633
IN THEORY, THEY JUST STUN AND

731
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,500
DISORIENT PEOPLE.

732
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:52,366
BUT THEY CAN GENERATE HEAT

733
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:53,666
IN EXCESS OF 2,000 DEGREES.

734
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:54,933
SO YOU'D HOPE OFFICERS WOULD

735
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,120
BE REALLY CAREFUL WITH THEM,

736
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,500
CERTAINLY A LOT MORE CAREFUL

737
00:18:57,566 --> 00:19:02,500
THAN THIS.

738
00:19:02,566 --> 00:19:03,233
WE HEARD A LOUD... A LOUD

739
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:03,966
NOISE, WHICH WAS BUSTING THROUGH

740
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:04,700
THE DOOR.

741
00:19:04,766 --> 00:19:08,066
THEN CAME A FLASH GRENADE

742
00:19:08,133 --> 00:19:08,800
RIGHT INTO THE TWO-YEAR-OLD'S

743
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:09,266
BED.

744
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,166
YOU CAN SEE BY THIS PICTURE

745
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,200
HOW BADLY IT WAS DAMAGED.

746
00:19:12,266 --> 00:19:12,733
AND I KEPT BEGGING THE

747
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,533
OFFICER, YOU KNOW,

748
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,133
"GIVE ME MY SON.

749
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,866
JUST LET ME HOLD HIM.

750
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:15,600
HE'S SCARED.

751
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:16,966
HE NEEDS ME."

752
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:18,266
THE OFFICER TOLD ME TO SHUT UP

753
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,200
AND GO SIT DOWN.

754
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:20,100
POLICE WERE LOOKING FOR

755
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:23,833
DRUGS, BUT FOUND NOTHING.

756
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:29,833
John: YEAH, THE POLICE THREW

757
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,466
A FLASHBANG GRENADE INTO A CRIB.

758
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:31,266
AND LOOK, I'M NO POLICEMAN.

759
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,700
I HAVEN'T STUDIED ALL THE

760
00:19:33,766 --> 00:19:34,500
BYLAWS, I DON'T HAVE A PhD IN

761
00:19:34,566 --> 00:19:35,166
FLASH GRENADE-OLOGY.

762
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:36,466
BUT PURELY AS A LAYPERSON,

763
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:37,233
THE POLICE SHOULD NOT HAVE

764
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:37,800
THROWN THAT FUCKING GRENADE

765
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:39,233
INTO A FUCKING CRIB.

766
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,200
AND IF THE POLICE ARE TRULY

767
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:41,433
INCAPABLE OF KNOWING WHETHER

768
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,540
THEY'RE THROWING A GRENADE

769
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,066
INTO A CRIB, MAYBE THEY

770
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:47,100
SHOULDN'T HAVE FUCKING GRENADES.

771
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,500
HERE'S ANOTHER QUICK RULE THAT

772
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:50,000
APPLIES TO BOTH HORSESHOES AND

773
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:51,933
HAND GRENADES: IF YOU THROW

774
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,133
EITHER OF THEM INTO A CRIB

775
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,933
EVEN ONE TIME, GUESS WHAT?

776
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,266
YOU DON'T GET TO PLAY WITH THEM

777
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,000
ANYMORE.

778
00:19:57,066 --> 00:19:58,433
NOW, THANKFULLY, THAT BABY

779
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,633
SURVIVED.

780
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,842
BUT IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT

781
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:03,076
POLICE DIDN'T REALIZE THERE WERE

782
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,700
CHILDREN IN THE HOUSE, GIVEN

783
00:20:04,766 --> 00:20:06,100
THE FAMILY HAD LIVED AT THAT

784
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,033
ADDRESS FOR TWO MONTHS, AND

785
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,266
THERE WAS A MINIVAN WITH

786
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,300
FOUR CAR SEATS IN THE DRIVEWAY.

787
00:20:10,366 --> 00:20:12,066
AND WHEN THEY DID FIND THE MAN

788
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:13,766
THEY WERE ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR

789
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,266
AT A DIFFERENT HOUSE, HE

790
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,233
SURRENDERED PEACEFULLY WHEN

791
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,233
OFFICERS KNOCKED ON HIS DOOR.

792
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,600
SO IN HINDSIGHT, GRENADING

793
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,133
A BABY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN

794
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
NECESSARY.

795
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:24,426
AND, AGAIN, THEY WERE LOOKING

796
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:29,500
FOR DRUGS.

797
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:32,766
AND, AGAIN, THEY DIDN'T FIND

798
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,000
WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR.

799
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:34,900
THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

800
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:35,800
AND TROUBLINGLY, POLICE DON'T

801
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:36,433
HAVE TO WORK VERY HARD TO GET

802
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,133
A WARRANT TO BLOW SOMEONE'S DOOR

803
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,866
OPEN.

804
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:39,066
JUDGES HAVE TO SIGN OFF ON

805
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:40,209
WARRANTS, AND IDEALLY, THEY

806
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:41,666
WOULD FUNCTION AS A CHECK HERE.

807
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:42,933
BUT IN PRACTICE, THEY OFTEN

808
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,700
DON'T SPEND MUCH TIME

809
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:44,600
SCRUTINIZING POLICE

810
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,500
JUSTIFICATION.

811
00:20:46,566 --> 00:20:48,333
AN INVESTIGATION IN UTAH OF MORE

812
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
THAN 10,000

813
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:50,300
ELECTRONICALLY-SUBMITTED

814
00:20:50,366 --> 00:20:51,300
WARRANTS FOUND THAT HALF

815
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:52,766
THE TIME, JUDGES APPROVED

816
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,633
WARRANTS IN LESS THAN THREE

817
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,709
MINUTES, WITH HUNDREDS SIGNED

818
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:57,300
OFF IN LESS THAN 30 SECONDS.

819
00:20:57,366 --> 00:20:59,200
THAT'S ABSURD!

820
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:00,966
EVEN THE CASES ON

821
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:02,933
"CHRISSY'S COURT" WERE LONGER

822
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,333
THAN 30 SECONDS, AND IT WAS A

823
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:05,933
SHOW ON QUIBI, A PLATFORM THAT

824
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,500
WE ALL COLLECTIVELY FEVER

825
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,733
DREAMED.

826
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,100
AND THE BAR FOR GETTING A JUDGE

827
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,000
TO SIGN OFF ON A SEARCH WARRANT

828
00:21:11,066 --> 00:21:12,766
IS PRETTY LOW.

829
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,833
ALL YOU NEED IS PROBABLE CAUSE,

830
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,466
OR A REASONABLE BELIEF THAT

831
00:21:17,533 --> 00:21:18,433
EVIDENCE OF A CRIME WILL BE

832
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,066
FOUND IN THE PLACE YOU WANT TO

833
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:19,700
SEARCH.

834
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:20,500
AND THAT BELIEF CAN COME FROM

835
00:21:20,566 --> 00:21:22,100
ANYWHERE.

836
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,566
WHETHER IT'S THE SMELL OF

837
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:24,800
MARIJUANA OR, VERY OFTEN,

838
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,233
THE WORD OF A CONFIDENTIAL

839
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,800
INFORMANT, WHO MIGHT BE TRADING

840
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:30,866
TIPS FOR MONEY OR LENIENCY.

841
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:32,833
AND A LOT OF THOSE TIPS TURN OUT

842
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,900
TO BE COMPLETE BULLSHIT.

843
00:21:34,966 --> 00:21:42,933
TO GET THE SEARCH WARRANT THAT

844
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,833
LED TO THE RAID ON

845
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,633
RODERICK TALLEY'S HOME,

846
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,533
POLICE TOLD A JUDGE THAT

847
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,400
A CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT HAD

848
00:21:46,466 --> 00:21:47,300
BOUGHT COCAINE FROM HIM, AND

849
00:21:47,366 --> 00:21:48,166
THAT THEY'D OBSERVED THE

850
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:49,133
INTERACTION.

851
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,133
BUT LUCKILY, TALLEY HAD A

852
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,000
DOORBELL CAM THAT SHOWED

853
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:51,866
THE INFORMANT WALKING UP TO

854
00:21:51,933 --> 00:21:53,209
THE DOOR, ALONE, STANDING THERE,

855
00:21:53,233 --> 00:21:54,633
AND THEN WALKING AWAY.

856
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,333
AND LOOK, NORMALLY, I'M NOT

857
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,533
A BIG FAN OF DOORBELL CAMS.

858
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,500
ALL THEY DO IS RECORD ME GIVING

859
00:21:58,566 --> 00:21:59,366
MYSELF A FIVE MINUTE PEP-TALK

860
00:21:59,433 --> 00:22:00,433
BEFORE I ENTER ANY PARTY.

861
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:01,542
BUT IN THIS INSTANCE, I'M REALLY

862
00:22:01,566 --> 00:22:04,033
GLAD HE HAD ONE.

863
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,733
AND POLICE HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN

864
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,066
CAUGHT MAKING INFORMANTS UP,

865
00:22:08,133 --> 00:22:09,466
GIVING MISLEADING INFORMATION

866
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:10,609
IN THEIR WARRANT APPLICATION,

867
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:13,566
OR FAILING TO DO EVEN THE MOST

868
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:15,233
BASIC CHECKING TO SEE IF THEIR

869
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,533
SUSPECT IS ACTUALLY IN THE HOME

870
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,300
THEY'RE RAIDING, OR SOMEWHERE

871
00:22:21,366 --> 00:22:22,476
ELSE THAT THEY PROBABLY SHOULD

872
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,133
HAVE KNOWN ABOUT.

873
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,766
JOLANDA BLASSINGAME SAYS IT

874
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,233
WAS UTTERLY TERRIFYING, CHICAGO

875
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,800
POLICE ALLEGEDLY BREAKING HER

876
00:22:27,866 --> 00:22:30,133
DOOR DOWN IN NORTH LAWNDALE,

877
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,466
POINTING RIFLES AT HER CHILDREN

878
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:32,900
IN WHAT'S BEING CALLED A

879
00:22:32,966 --> 00:22:34,366
COLOSSAL POLICE BLUNDER.

880
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:36,166
THEY DID NOT BOTHER TO

881
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:37,933
PERFORM THE SIMPLEST,

882
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
MOST ROUTINE VERIFICATION.

883
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:41,633
THE TARGET OF THE WARRANT,

884
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,900
MR. BELL, WAS AT THAT TIME

885
00:22:43,966 --> 00:22:46,366
SERVING A 20-YEAR PRISON

886
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:48,500
SENTENCE FOR A MURDER CONVICTION

887
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:51,166
200 MILES AWAY IN HILL

888
00:22:51,233 --> 00:22:52,100
CORRECTIONAL CENTER IN

889
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:53,300
GALESBURG, ILLINOIS.

890
00:22:53,366 --> 00:22:55,066
John: WELL, THAT'S

891
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:55,900
PRETTY EMBARRASSING.

892
00:22:55,966 --> 00:22:57,006
BUT I GUESS IT'S LIKE WHEN

893
00:22:57,066 --> 00:22:58,400
YOU TURN YOUR HOME UPSIDE-DOWN

894
00:22:58,466 --> 00:22:59,642
LOOKING FOR YOUR KEYS, ONLY TO

895
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:00,766
DISCOVER THEY WERE IN YOUR

896
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,200
POCKET THE WHOLE TIME.

897
00:23:02,266 --> 00:23:03,666
ONLY IN THIS CASE, THE KEYS ARE

898
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:05,100
A MAN, THE HOME ISN'T YOURS, AND

899
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:06,376
YOUR POCKET IS A MEDIUM-SECURITY

900
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,666
PRISON IN ANOTHER ZIP CODE.

901
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:11,166
SO WHEN YOU HAVE BAD POLICE WORK

902
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:12,342
ON THE FRONT END, AND MINIMAL

903
00:23:12,366 --> 00:23:13,200
JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT ON THE BACK

904
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,276
END, IT BECOMES FAR TOO EASY TO

905
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,966
GET A SEARCH WARRANT.

906
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:18,800
AND ONCE POLICE HAVE ONE, THERE

907
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:19,800
REALLY AREN'T A LOT OF LIMITS ON

908
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,366
WHAT THEY CAN DO.

909
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,300
JUST ABOUT EVERY SEARCH WARRANT

910
00:23:23,366 --> 00:23:24,766
GIVES OFFICERS PERMISSION TO

911
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,200
BREAK DOWN A DOOR TO CONDUCT

912
00:23:26,266 --> 00:23:27,366
THE SEARCH.

913
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:28,713
AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF TALK

914
00:23:28,766 --> 00:23:30,966
RIGHT NOW SPECIFICALLY ABOUT

915
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:33,300
"NO-KNOCK" RAIDS, BUT IT'S WORTH

916
00:23:33,366 --> 00:23:34,409
NOTING, THE LINE BETWEEN "KNOCK"

917
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:36,300
AND "NO-KNOCK" IS VERY VERY

918
00:23:36,366 --> 00:23:37,376
THIN, THANKS TO A SERIES OF

919
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,866
COURT RULINGS LIKE THIS:

920
00:23:38,933 --> 00:23:42,566
THE U.S. SUPREME COURT RULED

921
00:23:42,633 --> 00:23:43,866
TODAY POLICE DO NOT HAVE TO

922
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:45,933
WAIT MORE THAN 20 SECONDS BEFORE

923
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,633
BREAKING INTO A DRUG SUSPECTS'

924
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,533
HOME, THE UNANIMOUS RULING SAID

925
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,720
WAITING ANY LONGER WOULD LET

926
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,200
SUSPECTS FLUSH EVIDENCE

927
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:56,400
DOWN THE TOILET.

928
00:23:56,466 --> 00:23:57,476
John: YEAH, THE RULING WAS,

929
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,740
GIVING YOU 20 SECONDS TO ANSWER

930
00:23:58,766 --> 00:23:59,333
YOUR DOOR IS REASONABLE, BECAUSE

931
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,300
YOU MIGHT FLUSH EVIDENCE DOWN

932
00:24:00,366 --> 00:24:01,300
THE TOILET.

933
00:24:01,366 --> 00:24:04,766
WHICH RAISES THE OBVIOUS

934
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:05,900
QUESTION HERE,

935
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:06,966
WHY THE FUCK ARE WE

936
00:24:07,033 --> 00:24:08,042
RAIDING PEOPLE'S HOMES FOR AN

937
00:24:08,066 --> 00:24:09,176
AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE THAT CAN BE

938
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,733
FLUSHED AWAY IN 20 SECONDS?

939
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,066
UNLESS SOMEONE IS ACCUSED OF

940
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:12,142
TRAFFICKING SMURFS OR STEALING

941
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:13,300
THE WORLD'S MOST VALUABLE

942
00:24:13,366 --> 00:24:14,566
GOLDFISH, MAYBE WE SHOULD BE

943
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:15,776
FINDING A DIFFERENT WAY TO DO

944
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,366
THIS.

945
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:18,566
AND POLICE REALLY AREN'T

946
00:24:18,633 --> 00:24:19,866
INCENTIVIZED TO GIVE YOU ANY

947
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:22,100
SECONDS TO ANSWER YOUR DOOR.

948
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,066
BECAUSE IN 2006, THE SUPREME

949
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:26,133
COURT RULED THAT, EVEN WHEN THEY

950
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,100
VIOLATE THE RULES REQUIRING THEM

951
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,900
TO KNOCK, ANNOUNCE, AND WAIT,

952
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:31,166
THE PROSECUTION CAN STILL USE

953
00:24:31,233 --> 00:24:32,033
THE EVIDENCE OBTAINED DURING

954
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,233
THAT SEARCH.

955
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,133
SO THERE'S OFTEN NO MEANINGFUL

956
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,900
CONSEQUENCES TO BUSTING RIGHT

957
00:24:35,966 --> 00:24:38,266
THROUGH YOUR DOOR.

958
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:39,966
AND DECISIONS LIKE THAT MEAN THE

959
00:24:40,033 --> 00:24:41,300
DISTINCTION BETWEEN A NO-KNOCK

960
00:24:41,366 --> 00:24:42,800
RAID AND A "KNOCK AND ANNOUNCE"

961
00:24:42,866 --> 00:24:44,566
RAID IS BARELY THERE.

962
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:46,600
AS A JUDGE IN GEORGIA PUT IT,

963
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:47,776
"EITHER THE DOOR COMES IN AND

964
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,733
PEOPLE ARE YELLING,

965
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,433
"SHERIFF'S OFFICE" OR

966
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,133
PEOPLE YELL, "SHERIFF'S OFFICE"

967
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:56,733
AND THE DOOR COMES IN."

968
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,566
AND THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY

969
00:24:57,633 --> 00:24:58,033
THE SAME!

970
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,133
IT'S LIKE COMPARING

971
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,200
BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD AND

972
00:25:00,233 --> 00:25:01,000
JESSICA CHASTAIN.

973
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,100
ARE THEY DIFFERENT?

974
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:03,242
NOMINALLY, SURE, ALTHOUGH NOT

975
00:25:03,266 --> 00:25:04,506
IN ANY WAY THAT MEANS ANYTHING.

976
00:25:04,566 --> 00:25:05,266
IF YOU DO NEED TO TELL THEM

977
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:06,100
APART, BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD IS

978
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,066
THE ONE WHO LOOKS SLIGHTLY MORE

979
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:08,633
LIKE JESSICA CHASTAIN.

980
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,633
AND ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS, THERE

981
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,233
IS JUST CASE AFTER CASE OF THE

982
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,100
POLICE MESSING UP THE EXECUTION

983
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:14,933
OF A RAID, THAT RANGE FROM THE

984
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,766
HORRIFIC TO THE ALMOST

985
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:19,366
CARTOONISHLY IDIOTIC... LIKE

986
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:23,100
THIS VIDEO OF THEM LOOKING FOR

987
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:24,333
A SUSPECTED DRUG DEALER,

988
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:24,833
BUT INSTEAD

989
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,833
RAIDING THE HOME OF HIS

990
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,600
NEIGHBOR, ONREE NORRIS,

991
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:27,800
A 78-YEAR-OLD WITH HEART

992
00:25:27,866 --> 00:25:28,733
PROBLEMS WHO THANKFULLY

993
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,876
SURVIVED, DESPITE THE POLICE

994
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,500
MAKING ONE MISTAKE AFTER

995
00:25:30,566 --> 00:25:31,800
ANOTHER.

996
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:33,466
HOW DID DEPUTIES END UP

997
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,200
HITTING A HOUSE WITH A DIFFERENT

998
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:36,866
COLOR, A SEPARATE DRIVEWAY,

999
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:37,976
ITS OWN MAILBOX, AND ANOTHER

1000
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,900
ADDRESS?

1001
00:25:38,966 --> 00:25:39,833
WHAT'S WRONG?

1002
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,700
MISSED IT.

1003
00:25:40,766 --> 00:25:48,000
OH!

1004
00:25:48,066 --> 00:25:49,666
[BLEEP].

1005
00:25:49,733 --> 00:25:50,133
[BLEEP]!

1006
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,233
MISSED IT.

1007
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,033
FIRST, THE TACTICAL TEAM GOT

1008
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,109
LOST FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS FROM

1009
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:53,900
A GPS APP ON A PHONE.

1010
00:25:53,966 --> 00:25:54,666
TURN RIGHT ON...

1011
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:55,666
THEN, AS SOON AS THEY GOT

1012
00:25:55,733 --> 00:25:57,100
TO THE CORRECT ADDRESS,

1013
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:58,000
DEPUTIES WERE IMMEDIATELY

1014
00:25:58,066 --> 00:25:59,533
CONFUSED.

1015
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,666
WHERE'S THE HOUSE?

1016
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:04,633
WHERE'S THE HOUSE?

1017
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,100
THEY WALKED RIGHT PAST THE

1018
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:07,600
TARGET HOUSE WITHOUT CLEARING IT

1019
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:08,676
AND HEADED THROUGH THE TREE LINE

1020
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,300
TO THE NEXT HOUSE ON THE STREET.

1021
00:26:12,366 --> 00:26:12,933
EVEN THEN, DEPUTIES WERE UNSURE.

1022
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,800
THIS HOUSE?

1023
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:17,633
THIS HOUSE?

1024
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,933
LOOKING BACK AND FORTH

1025
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,633
AT THE TWO HOUSES,

1026
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,233
IT WAS TOO LATE.

1027
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,933
THE ENTRY TEAM WAS ALREADY

1028
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,666
FORCING ITS WAY INTO ONREE'S

1029
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:26,900
HOME.

1030
00:26:26,966 --> 00:26:28,633
John: OH, FOR FUCK'S SAKE.

1031
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,966
IT IS HUMILIATING TO WATCH A

1032
00:26:30,033 --> 00:26:33,666
TRAINED TACTICAL UNIT OUTFITTED

1033
00:26:33,733 --> 00:26:36,866
WITH MILITARY HARDWARE GET SO

1034
00:26:36,933 --> 00:26:38,466
COMPLETELY STUMPED BY

1035
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:39,133
"THE MYSTERY OF THE

1036
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,100
MORE THAN ONE HOUSE."

1037
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,442
AND YOU MIGHT THINK, "OH, THAT'S

1038
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:42,766
JUST A ONE-OFF"... MISTAKES LIKE

1039
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:44,400
THAT HAPPEN ALL THE TIME.

1040
00:26:44,466 --> 00:26:45,706
IT WAS A TOTAL NIGHTMARE FOR

1041
00:26:45,766 --> 00:26:47,700
THIS FAMILY WHEN COPS BURST INTO

1042
00:26:47,766 --> 00:26:49,100
THEIR HOME, WHICH TURNED OUT TO

1043
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:51,033
BE THE WRONG ADDRESS.

1044
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,366
THAT IS THE WRONG APARTMENT.

1045
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:53,433
AND THAT IS THE ONE THAT

1046
00:26:53,466 --> 00:26:55,700
THE S.W.A.T. TEAM WENT INSIDE.

1047
00:26:55,766 --> 00:26:59,033
SHAWN AND HIS WIFE, WHO BOTH

1048
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,140
WORK FULL TIME, LIVE HERE.

1049
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:00,866
THE PEOPLE THE POLICE WERE

1050
00:27:00,933 --> 00:27:02,233
LOOKING FOR LIVE HERE.

1051
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,166
THE DEA IS APOLOGIZING FOR

1052
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:06,500
BURSTING INTO THE RENCK FAMILY

1053
00:27:06,566 --> 00:27:08,266
HOME WITH THE BRADLEY COUNTY

1054
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:09,033
S.W.A.T. TEAM, ONLY LATER

1055
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,033
FINDING OUT THAT IT WAS

1056
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,700
THE WRONG HOME.

1057
00:27:11,766 --> 00:27:13,633
THAT'S NOT A MISTAKE TO MAKE.

1058
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,433
HELL, YOU COULD HAVE LOOKED

1059
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,633
AT THE MAILBOX.

1060
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,033
John: YEAH, EXACTLY.

1061
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,000
AND THE POLICE HITTING

1062
00:27:18,066 --> 00:27:19,166
THE WRONG ADDRESS IS JUST

1063
00:27:19,233 --> 00:27:22,266
COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE WHEN

1064
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:23,333
THE STAKES ARE SO HIGH.

1065
00:27:23,366 --> 00:27:24,933
EVEN EDIBLE ARRANGEMENTS MANAGES

1066
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,033
TO DELIVER TO THE CORRECT

1067
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,566
ADDRESS, AND THAT BUSINESS IS

1068
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:34,966
JUST PURE CHAOTIC EVIL.

1069
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:35,733
"HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!

1070
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,600
PLEASE ENJOY THIS FLAVORLESS

1071
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:37,566
CRUCIFIED MELON."

1072
00:27:37,633 --> 00:27:38,709
AMAZINGLY, THERE OFTEN AREN'T

1073
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:39,600
CONSEQUENCES FOR CASES LIKE

1074
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:40,400
THOSE.

1075
00:27:40,466 --> 00:27:41,300
OFFICERS ARE RARELY CRIMINALLY

1076
00:27:41,366 --> 00:27:42,442
CHARGED, AND EVEN MORE RARELY

1077
00:27:42,466 --> 00:27:43,266
CONVICTED.

1078
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:44,342
BOTCHED RAIDS USUALLY AREN'T

1079
00:27:44,366 --> 00:27:45,366
EVEN INVESTIGATED, UNLESS

1080
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:46,566
SOMEONE IS KILLED, THE MEDIA

1081
00:27:46,633 --> 00:27:47,500
GETS INVOLVED, OR THERE'S

1082
00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:48,366
A LAWSUIT.

1083
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,133
AND EVEN WHEN THEY HAPPEN,

1084
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,466
POLICE OFFICERS ARE PROTECTED

1085
00:27:51,533 --> 00:27:52,576
FROM CIVIL LIABILITY BY THE

1086
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,133
DOCTRINE OF QUALIFIED IMMUNITY.

1087
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,633
AS FOR THEIR DEPARTMENTS,

1088
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,766
THEY AREN'T EVEN RESPONSIBLE FOR

1089
00:27:58,833 --> 00:27:59,842
PAYING TO REPAIR A BROKEN FRONT

1090
00:27:59,866 --> 00:28:01,300
DOOR, OR COMPENSATING RESIDENTS

1091
00:28:01,366 --> 00:28:03,133
FOR ANY OTHER LOSSES OR DAMAGES,

1092
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,309
EVEN WHEN THEY RAID THE WRONG

1093
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:06,900
RESIDENCE.

1094
00:28:06,966 --> 00:28:08,266
WHICH IS JUST ABSURD.

1095
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:09,800
LOOK, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY

1096
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:11,066
INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS, AND NOT

1097
00:28:11,133 --> 00:28:12,176
JUST FOR THE PEOPLE WHOSE HOMES

1098
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,766
ARE RAIDED.

1099
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:14,800
FOR THE POLICE, TOO.

1100
00:28:14,866 --> 00:28:16,166
THAT SAME INVESTIGATION THAT

1101
00:28:16,233 --> 00:28:17,566
FOUND 81 CIVILIANS HAD BEEN

1102
00:28:17,633 --> 00:28:18,966
KILLED IN RAIDS FOUND THAT

1103
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:22,000
13 POLICE OFFICERS HAD DIED,

1104
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:24,500
AS WELL.

1105
00:28:24,566 --> 00:28:25,000
WHICH SHOULDN'T BE THAT

1106
00:28:25,066 --> 00:28:25,600
SURPRISING.

1107
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:27,033
THESE RAIDS ARE, BY DESIGN,

1108
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,433
HIGHLY DISORIENTING, AND FOR THE

1109
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,066
PEOPLE WOKEN UP IN THE MIDDLE OF

1110
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:30,366
THE NIGHT TO THE SOUNDS OF AN

1111
00:28:30,433 --> 00:28:31,266
ARMED INVASION, THEY HAVE TO

1112
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,566
MAKE A SPLIT-SECOND DECISION

1113
00:28:32,633 --> 00:28:33,400
WHETHER OR NOT TO DEFEND

1114
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:36,266
THEMSELVES.

1115
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:36,900
THAT IS SOMETHING EVERYONE CAN

1116
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,000
UNDERSTAND.

1117
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:39,733
IN GEORGIA, A REPUBLICAN STATE

1118
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,666
SENATOR GOT IN TROUBLE FOR

1119
00:28:40,733 --> 00:28:42,333
SAYING, IF POLICE RAIDED HIS

1120
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,166
HOME IN A NO-KNOCK RAID,

1121
00:28:45,233 --> 00:28:46,233
HE WOULD SHOOT THEM DEAD,

1122
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,533
AND WHEN HE WAS PUSHED ON THAT,

1123
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,333
HE DID NOT BACK DOWN.

1124
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,166
IF SOMEBODY KICKS DOWN

1125
00:28:51,233 --> 00:28:52,233
MY DOOR UNANNOUNCED,

1126
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:53,276
THEY WILL MEET WITH RESISTANCE,

1127
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,766
I GUARANTEE YOU.

1128
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:58,133
BUT IF IT'S LAW ENFORCEMENT?

1129
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,300
THEY WOULD BE THERE...

1130
00:28:59,366 --> 00:29:00,376
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW AT

1131
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:00,800
3:00 IN THE MORNING?

1132
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:01,900
SOMEBODY SHOWS UP IN

1133
00:29:01,966 --> 00:29:02,500
BLACK OUTFITS, THEY CAN SAY

1134
00:29:02,566 --> 00:29:03,233
THEY'RE LAW ENFORCEMENT.

1135
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,033
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT.

1136
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,766
THEY'VE GOT A GUN POINTED AT ME.

1137
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:06,266
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, DALE?

1138
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:07,266
John: YEAH, DALE!

1139
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:12,333
WHAT'RE YOU GONNA DO?

1140
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,266
I KNOW THAT GUY LOOKS LIKE A BIT

1141
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,166
OF A BELLIGERENT ASSHOLE,

1142
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:16,866
BUT THE THING IS, THE COUNTRY

1143
00:29:16,933 --> 00:29:17,766
IS FULL OF BELLIGERENT ASSHOLES,

1144
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:19,700
AND LOTS OF THEM HAVE GUNS.

1145
00:29:19,766 --> 00:29:20,566
AND WHILE IT IS EASY FOR

1146
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:21,333
A WHITE STATE SENATOR TO

1147
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,400
FANTASIZE ABOUT HIMSELF,

1148
00:29:22,433 --> 00:29:24,300
OR INDEED, DALE, MOUNTING A

1149
00:29:24,366 --> 00:29:26,566
HYPOTHETICAL ARMED RESISTANCE

1150
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:28,266
TO A POLICE RAID, FOR THOSE WHO

1151
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,633
ACTUALLY DO GET RAIDED, THERE

1152
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,033
ARE REAL CONSEQUENCES TO THOSE

1153
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,400
ACTIONS... IF NOT DEATH, THEN

1154
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:33,866
SERIOUS CRIMINAL CHARGES.

1155
00:29:33,933 --> 00:29:35,033
JUST A FEW HOURS AFTER

1156
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,233
BREONNA TAYLOR WAS KILLED,

1157
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,033
HER BOYRIEND, KENNETH WALKER,

1158
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,366
WHO BELIEVED THE POLICE WERE

1159
00:29:39,433 --> 00:29:40,933
INTRUDERS, WAS CHARGED WITH

1160
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,466
ATTEMPTED MURDER FOR FIRING

1161
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:43,576
HIS GUN DURING THE RAID AND

1162
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,300
ALLEGEDLY INJURING AN OFFICER

1163
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,766
IN THE LEG.

1164
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:47,900
THOSE CHARGES WERE DROPPED,

1165
00:29:47,966 --> 00:29:49,366
BUT ONLY BECAUSE HE HAD NATIONAL

1166
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:51,433
ATTENTION AND A GOOD LAWYER.

1167
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,766
MEANWHILE, 18-YEAR-OLD

1168
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,800
TYLER HARRELL WAS SENTENCED TO

1169
00:29:54,866 --> 00:29:56,300
13 AND A HALF YEARS IN PRISON

1170
00:29:56,366 --> 00:29:57,033
AFTER HE INJURED A POLICE

1171
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,700
OFFICER DURING A SURPRISE

1172
00:29:58,766 --> 00:30:00,233
DRUG RAID AT HIS HOME, EVEN

1173
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,460
THOUGH A JURY FOUND "NO PROOF

1174
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,366
THAT HE KNEW HE WAS SHOOTING

1175
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,133
AT POLICE."

1176
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,466
LIVES ARE GETTING DESTROYED

1177
00:30:05,533 --> 00:30:07,500
THROUGH POLICE RAIDS.

1178
00:30:07,566 --> 00:30:09,200
AND EVEN IF NOBODY GETS

1179
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,866
PHYSICALLY HURT, THAT DOESN'T

1180
00:30:10,933 --> 00:30:13,300
MEAN NO DAMAGE IS DONE.

1181
00:30:13,366 --> 00:30:15,233
HAVING YOUR HOME VIOLATED IS

1182
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,333
A TRAUMATIZING EXPERIENCE,

1183
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,680
OFTEN EXACERBATED BY HOW TARGETS

1184
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,200
OF RAIDS ARE TREATED.

1185
00:30:20,266 --> 00:30:21,833
TAKE ANJANETTE YOUNG,

1186
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,142
A SOCIAL WORKER IN CHICAGO WHOSE

1187
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:25,233
HOME WAS RAIDED, AND WHO FOUGHT

1188
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,866
HARD TO GET THE BODY CAMERA

1189
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:28,700
FOOTAGE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC,

1190
00:30:28,766 --> 00:30:30,366
EVEN THOUGH IT IS INCREDIBLY

1191
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:30,900
DIFFICULT TO WATCH.

1192
00:30:30,966 --> 00:30:32,333
YOU SEE THEM RUNNING UP TO

1193
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,166
THE APARTMENT COMPLEX WITH THE

1194
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:39,233
BATTERING RAM IN THEIR HAND.

1195
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,800
IT WAS SO TRAUMATIC TO HEAR

1196
00:30:41,866 --> 00:30:43,133
THE WAY THE THING WAS HITTING

1197
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,633
THE DOOR.

1198
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,866
GO, GO, GO, GO!

1199
00:30:45,933 --> 00:30:46,766
SEARCH WARRANT!

1200
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:47,566
SEARCH WARRANT!

1201
00:30:47,633 --> 00:30:49,366
POLICE SEARCH WARRANT!

1202
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:50,600
AND IT HAPPENED SO FAST,

1203
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:51,500
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO PUT ON

1204
00:30:51,566 --> 00:30:52,600
CLOTHES.

1205
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:54,133
YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG HOUSE!

1206
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,900
AND SHE WAS RIGHT.

1207
00:30:55,966 --> 00:30:57,433
THEY WERE IN THE WRONG HOUSE.

1208
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,433
WE FOUND THEY SIMPLY TOOK THE

1209
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,433
WORD OF AN INFORMANT WHO GAVE

1210
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,033
THEM ANJANETTE YOUNG'S ADDRESS.

1211
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,766
THE INFORMANT CLAIMED A

1212
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:06,366
23-YEAR-OLD MAN WHO WAS A KNOWN

1213
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:08,000
FELON HAD A GUN AND AMMO INSIDE.

1214
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,666
I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT PERSON

1215
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:10,466
IS.

1216
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:11,576
I'VE BEEN LIVING HERE FOR FOUR

1217
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,680
YEARS AND NOBODY LIVES HERE

1218
00:31:12,733 --> 00:31:13,466
BUT ME!

1219
00:31:13,533 --> 00:31:14,100
OKAY.

1220
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:14,633
OKAY.

1221
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,033
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHOUT.

1222
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,733
I DON'T HAVE TO SHOUT!

1223
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,366
THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

1224
00:31:21,433 --> 00:31:22,500
John: YEAH, IT IS.

1225
00:31:22,566 --> 00:31:23,233
THEY BROKE INTO HER HOME, HAVING

1226
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,600
DONE NEXT TO NO DUE DILIGENCE,

1227
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:29,000
AND HANDCUFFED HER COMPLETELY

1228
00:31:29,066 --> 00:31:31,033
NAKED, BEFORE EVENTUALLY

1229
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,966
THROWING A BLANKET OVER HER,

1230
00:31:32,033 --> 00:31:32,866
WHILE SHE WAS STILL

1231
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:34,000
HANDCUFFED.

1232
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:35,000
AND THEN THEY SAID, "YOU DON'T

1233
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:36,000
HAVE TO SHOUT."

1234
00:31:36,066 --> 00:31:36,700
SHOUTING IS NOT THE DRASTIC

1235
00:31:36,766 --> 00:31:37,933
MEASURE BEING TAKEN HERE.

1236
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,366
PEOPLE SHOUT FOR MANY REASONS.

1237
00:31:39,433 --> 00:31:41,166
BECAUSE THEY WANT PEANUTS.

1238
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,933
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO

1239
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,142
GET UP OR JUST BECAUSE THE SONG

1240
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:44,933
TOLD THEM TO.

1241
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,266
WHEN YOU ARE HANDCUFFED NAKED

1242
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:47,733
IN YOUR OWN HOME BECAUSE

1243
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,300
THE POLICE SCREWED UP

1244
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:50,566
A SEARCH WARRANT, SHOUTING

1245
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:51,500
SHOULD BE IN YOUR FUCKING

1246
00:31:51,566 --> 00:31:53,000
MIRANDA RIGHTS.

1247
00:31:53,066 --> 00:31:55,766
AND WHEN YOU TREAT PEOPLE

1248
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:57,200
LIKE THAT, IT'S CLEAR YOU HAVE

1249
00:31:57,266 --> 00:31:58,800
NO INTEREST IN FORGING A HEALTHY

1250
00:31:58,866 --> 00:31:59,800
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY

1251
00:31:59,866 --> 00:32:01,133
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SERVING.

1252
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,309
INSTEAD, THE COMMUNITY HAS TO

1253
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:03,966
LIVE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT

1254
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:05,500
NO SPACE IS TRULY SECURE FROM

1255
00:32:05,566 --> 00:32:09,800
THE THREAT OF POLICE VIOLENCE.

1256
00:32:09,866 --> 00:32:10,533
THAT IS A MESSAGE THAT IS

1257
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,300
RECEIVED LOUD AND CLEAR

1258
00:32:11,366 --> 00:32:13,566
FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE.

1259
00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:19,233
SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT?

1260
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,766
WELL, I WOULD ARGUE SMALL

1261
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:22,166
CHANGES JUST AREN'T GOING TO CUT

1262
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:24,066
IT HERE.

1263
00:32:24,133 --> 00:32:25,400
BECAUSE, YEAH, IT WOULD BE

1264
00:32:25,466 --> 00:32:26,900
BETTER IF SEARCH WARRANTS WERE

1265
00:32:26,966 --> 00:32:28,466
HARDER TO GET AND OFFICERS WERE

1266
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:29,100
REQUIRED TO VERIFY INFORMATION

1267
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:29,766
FROM CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS AND

1268
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:30,500
WE DIDN'T GIVE MILITARY GRADE

1269
00:32:30,566 --> 00:32:31,233
EQUIPMENT TO PEOPLE WHO CAN'T BE

1270
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,166
TRUSTED NOT TO THROW IT

1271
00:32:34,233 --> 00:32:36,500
INTO A FUCKING CRIB.

1272
00:32:36,566 --> 00:32:37,100
BUT THAT IS JUST NOT NEARLY

1273
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:37,466
ENOUGH.

1274
00:32:37,533 --> 00:32:38,200
AND EVEN REFORMS THAT APPEAR

1275
00:32:38,266 --> 00:32:38,866
SWEEPING CAN BE PRETTY LIMITED.

1276
00:32:38,933 --> 00:32:40,766
AFTER BREONNA TAYLOR'S DEATH,

1277
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,133
NO-KNOCK WARRANTS WERE BANNED

1278
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,700
IN, AMONG OTHER PLACES,

1279
00:32:43,766 --> 00:32:47,700
LOUISVILLE AND VIRGINIA,

1280
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:48,433
WHICH INITIALLY SOUNDS GOOD.

1281
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,433
THE THING IS, AS YOU'VE SEEN

1282
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,266
TONIGHT, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

1283
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:51,966
"NO KNOCK" AND "KNOCK" IS

1284
00:32:52,033 --> 00:32:54,766
BASICALLY NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL.

1285
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:55,913
AND I'D ARGUE THAT THERE IS

1286
00:32:55,966 --> 00:32:56,766
A BIG SOLUTION HERE THAT IS

1287
00:32:56,833 --> 00:32:58,733
STARING US RIGHT IN THE FACE.

1288
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,809
AND THAT IS, STOP DOING DRUG

1289
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:01,000
RAIDS.

1290
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:02,700
JUST STOP IT.

1291
00:33:02,766 --> 00:33:04,700
AND IF THAT SOUNDS EXTREME,

1292
00:33:04,766 --> 00:33:05,842
YOU MIGHT WANT TO KNOW, THE

1293
00:33:05,866 --> 00:33:07,009
FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL

1294
00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:08,900
TACTICAL OFFICERS ASSOCIATION

1295
00:33:08,966 --> 00:33:10,833
RECOMMENDS THAT RAIDS NEVER

1296
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,166
BE USED TO SERVE NARCOTICS

1297
00:33:12,233 --> 00:33:13,242
WARRANTS, SAYING, "WHY WOULD YOU

1298
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:15,133
RUN INTO A GUNFIGHT?

1299
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,309
YOU DEFINITELY DON'T GO IN AND

1300
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:18,200
RISK YOUR LIFE FOR DRUGS."

1301
00:33:18,266 --> 00:33:20,433
AND HE'S RIGHT.

1302
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,566
DRUG RAIDS JUST HAVE TO STOP.

1303
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:25,033
AND RAIDS IN GENERAL SHOULD ONLY

1304
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,533
BE USED A LAST RESORT TO SAVE

1305
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,642
LIVES THAT ARE IN IMMEDIATE

1306
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:29,266
DANGER.

1307
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:30,933
BECAUSE BURSTING INTO SOMEONE'S

1308
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,500
HOME IS NEVER GOING TO BE SAFE

1309
00:33:32,566 --> 00:33:34,666
FOR ANYONE INVOLVED.

1310
00:33:34,733 --> 00:33:36,600
AND RIGHT NOW, RAIDS ARE BEING

1311
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:38,233
USED FAR TOO WIDELY, AND ARE

1312
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,340
DESTROYING LIVES, BOTH FOR

1313
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,409
THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE KILLED,

1314
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:42,233
INJURED, OR TRAUMATIZED,

1315
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,366
AND ALL THE BLACK AND BROWN

1316
00:33:44,433 --> 00:33:45,542
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO

1317
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:46,233
INTERNALIZE THE LESSONS

1318
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,033
OF THAT TRAUMA.

1319
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,766
THEY DESERVE THE RESPECT AND

1320
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:51,366
CONSIDERATION OF A POLICE FORCE

1321
00:33:51,433 --> 00:33:52,966
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO PROTECT THEM,

1322
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:55,166
NOT ONE THAT MERELY SEES THEIR

1323
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,033
LIVES AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

1324
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,566
ACTION MOVIE COSPLAY,

1325
00:33:58,633 --> 00:33:59,833
A THRILLING TV SPECIAL,

1326
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,133
OR THE REENACTMENT OF

1327
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,866
A MISREMEMBERED NURSERY RHYME

1328
00:34:06,933 --> 00:34:10,233
WITH A SOUPED-UP FUCKING

1329
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:10,800
BATTERING RAM.

1330
00:34:10,866 --> 00:34:11,800
AND MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, IF WE CAN

1331
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:12,566
DO THE RIGHT THING HERE, AND

1332
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:13,566
CLIMB DOWN FROM OUR CURRENT WILD

1333
00:34:13,633 --> 00:34:14,842
OVERUSE OF RAIDS, THEN, AND ONLY

1334
00:34:14,866 --> 00:34:15,942
THEN, WE'D HAVE A POLICE STORY

1335
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:16,700
LEGITIMATELY WORTH SINGING

1336
00:34:16,766 --> 00:34:17,900
ABOUT.

1337
00:34:17,966 --> 00:34:18,966
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

1338
00:34:19,033 --> 00:34:21,300
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

1339
00:34:21,366 --> 00:34:21,933
