1
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,766
John: HI THERE!

2
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:28,400
WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

3
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:29,033
STILL COMING TO YOU FROM THIS

4
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,733
BLANK VOID.

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,266
WE WERE OFF LAST WEEK,

6
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,433
BUT INTERESTINGLY, IT SEEMS

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,966
THE VOID WASN'T, BECAUSE

8
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:36,333
"MORTAL KOMBAT" WAS RELEASED

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,333
LAST WEEKEND, AND APPARENTLY,

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,500
THIS HAPPENS:

11
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:45,500
[LIGHTNING BOLTS STRIKE]

12
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:47,566
WHERE ARE WE?

13
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:50,400
WE ARE IN THE VOID.

14
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:51,586
IT IS THE REALM BETWEEN YOUR

15
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:52,500
WORLD AND MINE.

16
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:54,066
John: WHAT THE FUCK?

17
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:55,366
THE VOID IS TAKING OTHER JOBS

18
00:00:55,433 --> 00:00:57,933
NOW?

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,200
ALTHOUGH IT'S CLEARLY BEEN

20
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:00,500
THE BREAKOUT CHARACTER OF

21
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:01,642
THIS SHOW IN THE LAST YEAR,

22
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,200
SO I SHOULDN'T REALLY BE

23
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:04,342
SURPRISED IT'S DOING CAMEOS

24
00:01:04,366 --> 00:01:08,066
ELSEWHERE ON HBO MAX.

25
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:08,933
IT IS SO WHITE AND DEPRESSING,

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,200
I GENUINELY CONFUSED IT FOR

27
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:11,333
"MARE OF EASTTOWN."

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,566
LOOK, IT'S BEEN ANOTHER

29
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:14,233
CRAZY WEEK, FROM BIDEN MAKING

30
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,066
HIS FIRST ADDRESS TO CONGRESS,

31
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:16,866
TO THE NEWS THAT BORIS JOHNSON'S

32
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,266
PHONE NUMBER HAS SOMEHOW BEEN

33
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:19,493
AVAILABLE ONLINE FOR THE PAST

34
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:21,200
15 YEARS, TO RUDY GIULIANI'S

35
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:23,100
HOME BEING RAIDED BY THE FBI.

36
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,406
AN EVENT I'M HONESTLY SURPRISED

37
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:25,600
HE DIDN'T ACCIDENTALLY STREAM

38
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,433
LIVE ON TWITCH BY SITTING

39
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,533
ON HIS PHONE.

40
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,966
BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO DIVE

41
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:31,466
STRAIGHT IN WITH OUR MAIN STORY

42
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:32,333
TONIGHT, WHICH CONCERNS

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,366
THE COVID VACCINES.

44
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:35,200
THE END RESULT OF THE WORLD'S

45
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:36,346
GREATEST SCIENTISTS WORKING

46
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
AROUND THE CLOCK TO SAVE

47
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:38,666
COUNTLESS LIVES, IMMORTALIZED

48
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:39,809
IN A CARD WE'LL ALL DEFINITELY

49
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,400
LOSE IN A MONTH.

50
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:42,476
VITALLY IMPORTANT, BUT ALSO

51
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,700
TOO BIG TO FIT IN ANY STANDARD

52
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:45,300
WALLET?

53
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:46,476
WAY TO FUMBLE AT THE ONE YARD

54
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,233
LINE, SCIENCE.

55
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,666
AND NOT THAT WE NEEDED IT,

56
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:51,066
BUT THIS WEEK SAW YET ANOTHER

57
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:52,400
REMINDER OF JUST HOW DANGEROUS

58
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:53,866
COVID IS, WITH CASES IN INDIA

59
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:55,366
IN PARTICULAR SURGING AT

60
00:01:55,433 --> 00:01:57,666
A TRULY TERRIFYING RATE.

61
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:59,300
INDIA SET A WORLD RECORD

62
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:01,833
FOR DAILY COVID CASES OF

63
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,266
OVER 400,000, AND THAT IS

64
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,600
PROBABLY AN UNDERCOUNT.

65
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,300
AND OBVIOUSLY, THE WORLD

66
00:02:07,366 --> 00:02:08,406
SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING

67
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:09,609
IT CAN TO HELP INDIA RIGHT NOW.

68
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:11,333
BUT OUR BEST WAY OUT OF THIS

69
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,766
MESS, LONG-TERM, IS CLEARLY

70
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,866
VACCINES.

71
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:16,233
AND IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING,

72
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,033
WE IN THE U.S. ARE INCREDIBLY

73
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,733
FORTUNATE... WE CURRENTLY HAVE

74
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,200
ACCESS TO A LOT OF VACCINES,

75
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,400
AND MORE THAN HALF OF

76
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:23,733
U.S. ADULTS HAVE NOW GOTTEN

77
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,833
AT LEAST ONE DOSE,

78
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,166
WHICH IS GREAT.

79
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:28,800
THE BAD NEWS IS, SOME

80
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:30,000
VACCINATION LOCATIONS HAVE

81
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,100
ALREADY GONE FROM HAVING

82
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,366
NOT ENOUGH SUPPLY TO

83
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:34,066
NOT ENOUGH DEMAND.

84
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:35,000
ACCORDING TO THE CDC,

85
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:36,933
THE DAILY AVERAGE FOR

86
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,266
VACCINATIONS HAS DROPPED 20%

87
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,500
SINCE THE START OF THE MONTH.

88
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:41,033
A WORRYING TREND.

89
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,166
VACCINE DEMAND DECLINING IN

90
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:45,342
SOUTH CAROLINA, SOME PROVIDERS

91
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:46,400
LEFT WITH EXTRA DOSES AND

92
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,533
APPOINTMENTS WIDE OPEN.

93
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,166
PALM BEACH COUNTY HEALTHCARE

94
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:50,900
DISTRICT SAYS IT IS NOW FACING

95
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:52,533
10,000 APPOINTMENTS FOR THE

96
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,742
COUNTY'S VACCINE SITES REMAIN

97
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:54,866
UNFILLED SINCE THEY OPENED

98
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:55,800
THIS WEEK.

99
00:02:55,866 --> 00:02:56,800
APPOINTMENTS ARE GOING

100
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:57,866
UNFILLED.

101
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,466
WE'VE GOT THOUSANDS OF

102
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:00,576
APPOINTMENTS AVAILABLE OVER

103
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,366
THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND... AND

104
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:04,966
NO TAKERS AT THIS POINT.

105
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:05,533
John: IT'S TRUE.

106
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,766
A WORRYING AMOUNT

107
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:07,766
OF PEOPLE ARE HOLDING OFF ON

108
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:08,600
GETTING THE FREE COVID VACCINE.

109
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:09,566
AND I'M NOT SAYING YOU SHOULD

110
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:10,400
IMMEDIATELY GET SOMETHING JUST

111
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:11,100
BECAUSE IT'S FREE.

112
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,286
I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND GETTING

113
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:12,900
THESE OLD DOLLS ON CRAIGSLIST

114
00:03:12,966 --> 00:03:14,600
JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE FREE.

115
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,800
THEY'RE WEIRD, BROKEN, AND

116
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:18,900
WILL KILL YOU IN YOUR SLEEP.

117
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,500
BUT THESE VACCINES COULD SAVE

118
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:22,066
NOT JUST YOUR LIFE, BUT THE

119
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:23,142
LIVES OF PEOPLE AROUND YOU.

120
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,633
AND IT'S GENUINELY DISPIRITING

121
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,066
THAT JUST A FEW MONTHS INTO

122
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:27,500
THE VACCINE ROLLOUT,

123
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:28,609
WE'RE ALREADY AT THIS POINT.

124
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:30,466
AND THE PROBLEM IS, FOR THE

125
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:31,709
CORONAVIRUS, THE "HERD IMMUNITY

126
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,533
THRESHOLD" IS THOUGHT TO BE

127
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,866
BETWEEN 70 AND 90% OF THE

128
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:36,466
POPULATION.

129
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:39,100
BUT A SURVEY FOUND THAT WHILE

130
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,209
60% OF AMERICAN ADULTS HAVE GOT,

131
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:44,066
OR WANT TO GET, THE VACCINE,

132
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:45,276
ANOTHER 18% SAY "MAYBE," AND 22%

133
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,866
SAY "NO."

134
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:49,066
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING,

135
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:51,300
"WELL, IF EVERY "MAYBE" GETS

136
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:52,500
THE VACCINE, THAT PUTS US AT

137
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,633
78%!"

138
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,533
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT POLL DOESN'T

139
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,100
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CHILDREN, WHO

140
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,442
WE'RE NOT VACCINATING RIGHT NOW,

141
00:03:58,466 --> 00:03:59,700
AND WHO MAKE UP AROUND 22%

142
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:02,133
OF THE POPULATION.

143
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,633
SO WE NEED TO GET THE VACCINE

144
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,833
IN AS MANY ADULTS AS POSSIBLE,

145
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,066
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

146
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:08,900
AND THAT MEANS YOU REALLY NEED

147
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:10,800
TO GET VACCINATED.

148
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:11,966
AND OBVIOUSLY, I MEAN

149
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:12,766
THE COLLECTIVE "YOU," BUT ALSO

150
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,300
YOU, MIKE.

151
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:15,800
MIKE IN BALTIMORE.

152
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:16,700
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT THIS ON IN

153
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:17,766
THE BACKGROUND AT WORK

154
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,500
ON MONDAY, SO LISTEN TO ME.

155
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:20,686
SCHEDULE YOUR VACCINE, MIKE.

156
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:21,666
DON'T SAY YOU'RE GONNA

157
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:22,933
"LOOK INTO IT LATER."

158
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,800
JUST GOOGLE "VACCINE FINDER

159
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:26,500
BALTIMORE," IT TAKES SECONDS.

160
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:27,642
HERE ARE A LIST OF VACCINE SITES

161
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,900
IN YOUR AREA.

162
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:30,400
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING,

163
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:31,633
"EHH, I'M NOT SURE I NEED IT,

164
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,780
JOE ROGAN SAYS I'M PROBABLY

165
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:36,166
FINE."

166
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:37,242
LOOK, IT'S TRUE, YOU MIGHT NOT

167
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:39,400
GET SERIOUSLY SICK FROM COVID...

168
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:40,509
OR SICK AT ALL... YOU COULD

169
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:42,100
STILL INADVERTENTLY PASS IT TO

170
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,600
SOMEONE, WHO COULD THEN DIE.

171
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:44,933
AND BEFORE YOU SAY, "WELL,

172
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,800
VULNERABLE PEOPLE SHOULD JUST

173
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:47,733
GET VACCINATED, THEN"... THE

174
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,942
VACCINES ARE ONLY 95% EFFECTIVE,

175
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:49,700
MIKE.

176
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:50,933
SO THEY'LL PROBABLY BE OKAY,

177
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,366
BUT MAYBE NOT.

178
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:53,633
ALSO, THE MORE THE VIRUS

179
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,133
CIRCULATES, THE LIKELIER WE'LL

180
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,100
SEE MUTATIONS THAT MAKE IT MORE

181
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,933
DANGEROUS, POSSIBLY HELPING IT

182
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,533
TO EVADE THE VACCINE COMPLETELY,

183
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,800
PUTTING US BACK AT SQUARE ONE.

184
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,200
SO GET THE FUCKING VACCINE,

185
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:04,266
MIKE!

186
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,100
THE POINT IS, THERE IS

187
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,433
A PROBLEMATIC AMOUNT OF

188
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,833
VACCINE HESITANCY RIGHT NOW,

189
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,966
EVEN AMONG PEOPLE WHO YOU'D

190
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:11,800
REALLY LIKE TO THINK WOULD NOT

191
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:13,033
NEED CONVINCING.

192
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,533
WE MET ROBERT GANNON BEFORE

193
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,000
HE WENT IN TO VISIT HIS

194
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,500
77-YEAR-OLD MOTHER, KIYA, WHO

195
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:19,200
WAS ON A VENTILATOR RIGHT NOW IN

196
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:21,566
THE ICU DUE TO COVID.

197
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:22,866
HAD SHE BEEN VACCINATED?

198
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:24,300
SHE WAS NOT VACCINATED.

199
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,766
I THINK SHE WAS BEING HESITANT,

200
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:26,366
JUST WANTING TO SEE HOW THINGS

201
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:27,233
PLAYED OUT.

202
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,633
HAVE YOU BEEN VACCINATED?

203
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:29,966
I HAVE NOT.

204
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,366
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR YOU TO

205
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:32,900
GET VACCINATED?

206
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,100
MMM...

207
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:35,800
I'D WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S

208
00:05:35,866 --> 00:05:36,633
SAFE.

209
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,100
John: WOW.

210
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,176
THERE IS PERHAPS NO CLEARER SIGN

211
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,566
OF JUST HOW DEEP VACCINE

212
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,833
HESITANCY RUNS THAN SOMEONE

213
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,942
IN THAT GUY'S POSITION STILL

214
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:47,500
QUESTIONING WHETHER TO GET IT.

215
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:48,733
INSTEAD OF ASKING, "IS THERE

216
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,500
SUCH A THING AS TOO MUCH

217
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:50,233
VACCINE?

218
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,933
BECAUSE IF NOT, I'M GOING BACK

219
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,240
FOR INJECTIONS UNTIL I'M AROUND

220
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,933
80% PFIZER."

221
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,933
SO GIVEN ALL OF THAT, TONIGHT,

222
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,200
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE COVID

223
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:01,133
VACCINES... WHY PEOPLE ARE

224
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,966
HESITANT, WHAT THEIR WORRIES

225
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:03,800
ARE, AND HOW THEY MIGHT BE

226
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:05,533
REASSURED.

227
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,760
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

228
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,976
YOU CAN'T CHARACTERIZE ANY ONE

229
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,133
GROUP AS UNIFORMLY

230
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,700
VACCINE-HESITANT.

231
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:13,200
NO DEMOGRAPHIC IS A MONOLITH.

232
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:14,466
EVERY GROUP WILL HAVE SOME WHO

233
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,740
ARE EXCITED, AND OTHERS WHO ARE

234
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,900
ANXIOUS.

235
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:18,200
AND DIFFERENT GROUPS WILL BE

236
00:06:18,266 --> 00:06:19,276
ANXIOUS FOR DIFFERENT REASONS.

237
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,066
FOR INSTANCE, EARLY ON,

238
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:20,833
YOU PROBABLY HEARD A LOT ABOUT

239
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,600
HESITANCY AMONG SOME

240
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,033
BLACK AMERICANS.

241
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,220
WHICH CAN BE A REAL THING...

242
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:25,700
EVEN THIS PEDIATRICIAN HAD

243
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:27,633
RESERVATIONS.

244
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,066
WHEN THE VACCINE WAS FIRST

245
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:30,466
MADE AVAILABLE TO BOTH OF YOU,

246
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:31,333
DID YOU BOTH JUMP AT THE CHANCE

247
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,266
TO GET IT?

248
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:35,266
NO.

249
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,100
NO.

250
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,266
I MEAN, NOT ME ANYWAY.

251
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,533
I AM BLACK FIRST IN THIS

252
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,766
COUNTRY, AND THAT HAS WITH IT

253
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,366
A LOT OF BAGGAGE, TO TELL YOU

254
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:45,366
THE TRUTH.

255
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:46,966
AND SO, TO MY PUBLIC HEALTH

256
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,166
DEGREE, THE CULMINATING

257
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:49,333
EXPERIENCE THAT I DID WAS

258
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,200
RELATED TO THE RELATIONSHIP

259
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:54,133
BETWEEN BLACK PEOPLE AND

260
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,233
PHYSICIANS.

261
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,442
AND THAT RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN

262
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:59,300
A CANTANKEROUS ONE.

263
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:00,766
AND SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF

264
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,133
THINGS THAT ARE DEEPLY EMBEDDED

265
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,333
AND CHALLENGING TO OVERCOME,

266
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:03,866
EVEN WITHIN SOMEONE WHO'S

267
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:05,400
A SCIENTIST.

268
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,133
John: HONESTLY, I DO

269
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,566
UNDERSTAND THAT.

270
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:09,000
WE'VE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT

271
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:10,566
THE FRAUGHT RELATIONSHIP

272
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:11,400
BLACK AMERICANS HAVE WITH

273
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:12,800
HEALTH CARE, BASED ON BOTH

274
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,800
CURRENT BAD EXPERIENCES,

275
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:15,942
AND THE HISTORY OF INCIDENTS

276
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:17,866
LIKE THE TUSKEGEE EXPERIMENT,

277
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:18,976
WHERE DOCTORS LIED TO BLACK MEN,

278
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,400
ALLOWING THEM TO SUFFER FROM

279
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:22,333
UNTREATED SYPHILIS OVER DECADES.

280
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
OR, AS MOST U.S. HISTORY

281
00:07:23,466 --> 00:07:25,200
STUDENTS WOULD DESCRIBE IT:

282
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:28,333
"SOMETHING I HAVE NOT HEARD OF."

283
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,033
ALTHOUGH IT FEELS IMPORTANT TO

284
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,333
MENTION THAT THAT DOCTOR DID

285
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,000
WIND UP GETTING THE VACCINE.

286
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:33,000
AND, IN GENERAL, BLACK VACCINE

287
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:35,366
HESITANCY HAS DROPPED FAST.

288
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:36,933
ANOTHER GROUP YOU MIGHT HAVE

289
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,300
HEARD HAVE HIGH HESITANCY RATES

290
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:40,833
ARE REPUBLICANS, AND THAT'S

291
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,066
ALSO TRUE.

292
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:43,300
AROUND 30% OF REPUBLICANS SAY

293
00:07:43,366 --> 00:07:44,400
THEY WON'T GET IT.

294
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:46,666
AND IT'S NOT HARD TO SEE WHY...

295
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:47,800
FEARS AND DOUBTS ABOUT THE

296
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:50,033
VACCINE HAVE FLOWN AROUND

297
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,466
CONSERVATIVE MEDIA, WITH ONE OF

298
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:52,666
THE MOST PROMINENT

299
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:54,300
SUPERSPREADERS BEING THIS GUY.

300
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:56,300
WHAT ABOUT THIS VACCINE?

301
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:58,700
WHY ARE AMERICANS BEING

302
00:07:58,766 --> 00:07:59,600
DISCOURAGED FROM ASKING SIMPLE,

303
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:00,433
STRAIGHTFORWARD QUESTIONS ABOUT

304
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,966
IT?

305
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:03,233
QUESTIONS LIKE, HOW EFFECTIVE

306
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,000
ARE THESE DRUGS?

307
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:04,966
ARE THEY SAFE?

308
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:06,666
DO YOU NEED A REASON TO TURN

309
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:08,533
DOWN THE VACCINE?

310
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,266
AND WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO

311
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,266
TURN IT DOWN?

312
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:10,966
WILL YOU BE ALLOWED TO FLY ON

313
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,066
AIRPLANES?

314
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:13,166
OR GO TO WORK?

315
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:14,066
OR ENTER THE FRONT DOORS OF

316
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:15,833
MADISON SQUARE GARDEN?

317
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,400
OH, NOW THEY'RE TELLING US

318
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:21,033
THE VACCINE HAS A DELAYED

319
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,966
RESPONSE.

320
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:23,566
OKAY, DELAYED BY HOW LONG?

321
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,033
THEY DON'T SAY.

322
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,166
IF VACCINES WORK, WHY ARE

323
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:28,342
VACCINATED PEOPLE STILL BANNED

324
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:29,300
FROM LIVING NORMAL LIVES?

325
00:08:29,366 --> 00:08:29,933
HONESTLY, WHAT'S THE ANSWER TO

326
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,700
THAT?

327
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:32,876
SO MAYBE IT DOESN'T WORK AND

328
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,600
THEY'RE SIMPLY NOT TELLING YOU

329
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,100
THAT.

330
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,400
WELL, YOU HATE TO THINK THAT,

331
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:37,666
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'VE GOTTEN

332
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:39,366
TWO SHOTS, BUT WHAT'S THE OTHER

333
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:41,933
POTENTIAL EXPLANATION?

334
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,500
John: OKAY, IT'S GENUINELY

335
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:44,866
WEIRD TO SEE SOMEONE HOSTING A

336
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:46,966
SHOW ON A SUPPOSED NEWS NETWORK,

337
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:47,600
AND ENDING EVERY SENTENCE WITH

338
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,200
A QUESTION MARK.

339
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:50,866
ESPECIALLY WHEN ANSWERS TO MOST

340
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:52,366
OF THOSE QUESTIONS ARE OUT THERE

341
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:54,066
FOR ANYONE WHO CARES TO KNOW.

342
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,566
SO, FOR INSTANCE, THAT LAST

343
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:57,000
COMPLAINT THAT THE CDC STILL

344
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:58,533
RECOMMENDS WEARING MASKS INDOORS

345
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,900
WHEN AROUND VULNERABLE

346
00:08:59,966 --> 00:09:01,400
UNVACCINATED PEOPLE DOES NOT

347
00:09:01,466 --> 00:09:03,433
MEAN THE VACCINE DOESN'T WORK.

348
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,400
CLINICAL TRIALS FOUND THAT

349
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:07,166
VACCINES ARE SPECTACULARLY

350
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:08,309
SUCCESSFUL AT PREVENTING PEOPLE

351
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,233
FROM GETTING SERIOUS DISEASE.

352
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,700
AS FOR WHETHER THEY PROTECT

353
00:09:11,766 --> 00:09:13,033
YOU FROM SPREADING THE VIRUS,

354
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,566
THE TRIALS WEREN'T DESIGNED TO

355
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:15,400
ASSESS THAT.

356
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:16,866
BUT EVIDENCE SO FAR INDICATES

357
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:17,966
THEY DRASTICALLY REDUCE

358
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:19,800
TRANSMISSION.

359
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:21,300
THE REASON WE STILL SEE MASK AND

360
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:22,700
DISTANCING RECOMMENDATIONS IS

361
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:25,333
THAT THE CDC IS BEING CAUTIOUS,

362
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,266
AND WANTS TO BE SURE IT'S NOT

363
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,700
SPREADING BULLSHIT AROUND

364
00:09:28,766 --> 00:09:30,666
DURING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC

365
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:32,100
LIKE A FROZEN DINNER DUKE

366
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,833
WITH A TV SHOW.

367
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,266
ANYWAY, I HOPE THAT ANSWERS AT

368
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:38,033
LEAST ONE OF YOUR GAPE-MOUTHED

369
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,100
BAD-FAITH WONDERINGS, YOU

370
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,733
SCRUNCH-FACED FEAR-BABOON.

371
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,100
AND THE PROBLEM IS, WHEN PEOPLE

372
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,500
LIKE TUCKER "RAISE QUESTIONS"

373
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:44,666
WITHOUT BOTHERING TO ANSWER

374
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:46,000
THEM, THERE'S A LOT OF

375
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:47,733
MISINFORMATION OUT THERE FOR

376
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,500
PEOPLE TO THEN STUMBLE ON.

377
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:51,066
ANTI-VACCINE GROUPS HAVE BEEN

378
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,966
WAITING FOR A MOMENT LIKE THIS

379
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:55,200
TO SPREAD DOUBT, AND THE SCARY

380
00:09:55,266 --> 00:09:56,309
THING IS, THEY DON'T ACTUALLY

381
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,066
NEED TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THEY'RE

382
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:58,300
RIGHT.

383
00:09:58,366 --> 00:09:59,533
THEY JUST NEED TO CONVINCE

384
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,533
PEOPLE THAT NO ONE IS.

385
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,800
AND THAT TRACKS WITH RECENT

386
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:04,433
POLLING.

387
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,266
WHILE FEW BELIEVE SPECIFIC MYTHS

388
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,266
ABOUT THE VACCINE, LARGER

389
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,966
NUMBERS SAID THEY DIDN'T KNOW

390
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:11,933
WHETHER PARTICULAR MYTHS WERE

391
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,433
TRUE OR FALSE.

392
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,066
FOR INSTANCE, ONLY 4% OF PEOPLE

393
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:16,176
BELIEVE THE COVID VACCINE IS

394
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,533
MORE DEADLY THAN THE DISEASE,

395
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:26,600
BUT 25% SAY THEY DON'T KNOW.

396
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:27,433
AND THAT IS NOT GOOD.

397
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:27,700
FLASHBACK

398
00:10:27,766 --> 00:10:28,533
BECAUSE IF ANTI-VAXXERS

399
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,366
CAN SIMPLY SPREAD ENOUGH

400
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:30,576
MISINFORMATION TO CAUSE PEOPLE

401
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,709
TO THROW UP THEIR HANDS AND SAY,

402
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:32,666
"I JUST DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO GET

403
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,133
THE SHOT," THEY'VE ALREADY

404
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,900
SERIOUSLY FUCKED THINGS UP FOR

405
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:37,866
ALL OF US.

406
00:10:37,933 --> 00:10:39,213
AND TO BE CLEAR, MOST PEOPLE WHO

407
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:40,100
ARE HESITANT ARE NOT FANATICS OR

408
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,433
CONSPIRACY THEORISTS.

409
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,200
MANY ARE JUST TRYING TO MAKE

410
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:46,066
THE BEST DECISION FOR THEMSELVES

411
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:47,333
AND THEIR FAMILY, LIKE THAT

412
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,566
PEDIATRICIAN WE SAW EARLIER.

413
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:49,566
YOU DEFINITELY KNOW PEOPLE

414
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:51,800
LIKE THAT IN YOUR LIFE.

415
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:53,266
SO I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO SPEND

416
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,100
THE REST OF THIS PIECE TRYING TO

417
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:55,866
CLEAR UP SOME OF THE BIGGEST

418
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:57,000
MYTHS FLYING AROUND.

419
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:58,833
AND SOME ARE EASY TO DEBUNK

420
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,042
QUICKLY, LIKE THE CLAIMS THAT

421
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:01,833
BILL GATES IS USING THE VACCINE

422
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,766
TO PUT A MICROCHIP IN ALL OF US

423
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:04,433
...SOMETHING HIS WIFE HAD THIS

424
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,266
RESPONSE TO.

425
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,866
I KNOW MY HUSBAND IS NOT

426
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:08,800
VACCINATING PEOPLE AND PUTTING

427
00:11:08,866 --> 00:11:10,733
A MICROCHIP IN THEIR ARM BECAUSE

428
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,666
THAT TECHNOLOGY DOESN'T EVEN

429
00:11:11,733 --> 00:11:12,866
EXIST AND HE'S NEVER UTTERED

430
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:16,200
THE WORDS OUT OF HIS MOUTH, SO.

431
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:18,500
[LAUGHS]

432
00:11:18,566 --> 00:11:19,200
John: [LAUGHS]

433
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:20,666
OKAY.

434
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:22,066
THAT WASN'T THE REASSURING

435
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:23,700
PUSHBACK TO A BATSHIT CONSPIRACY

436
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,500
THEORY THAT I'D HOPED FOR.

437
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:26,806
"WE'RE NOT MICROCHIPPING PEOPLE

438
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:27,800
BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY DOESN'T

439
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:29,466
EXIST... YET... AND MY HUSBAND

440
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:31,466
HASN'T SAID IT OUT LOUD TO ME."

441
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:32,742
WHY WOULD YOU PUT IT LIKE THAT?

442
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:34,300
THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS

443
00:11:34,366 --> 00:11:35,533
A HUSBAND WON'T SAY OUT LOUD

444
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,233
TO HIS WIFE.

445
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,533
NOT DARK THINGS, JUST THINGS.

446
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,233
QUIET THOUGHTS A PARTNER

447
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,500
MIGHT NOT BE READY TO HEAR.

448
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:43,800
LIKE HOW, SOMETIMES, LATE AT

449
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:44,976
NIGHT, I THINK: WOULDN'T IT BE

450
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,066
NICE TO LIVE IN AN EGG?

451
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:48,833
AN EGG, TO BE IN.

452
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,366
NOT JUST AN OVAL-SHAPED

453
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:51,366
SLEEPING POD... I CAN GET AN

454
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:52,200
OVAL SHAPED SLEEPING POD,

455
00:11:52,266 --> 00:11:53,200
NOBODY WANTS ONE OF THOSE.

456
00:11:53,266 --> 00:11:55,300
I MEAN AN EGG.

457
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:56,733
A BIG EGG WITH ME IN IT, OR

458
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,166
MAYBE A NORMAL EGG, AND I'M

459
00:11:58,233 --> 00:11:59,366
SMALL, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

460
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:01,033
WHAT MATTERS IS I'M IN AN EGG.

461
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,933
NOT ALONE.

462
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'M WITH THE GLOOP, TOO,

463
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:06,233
IT'S JUST ME AND THE GLOOP.

464
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,766
NO OPENING, NO WINDOWS, NO WAY

465
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:08,466
TO EVER KNOW IF IT'S MORNING OR

466
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:09,766
NIGHT, SO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME

467
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:10,933
IT IS, ALL THE TIME?

468
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,133
EGG TIME.

469
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,066
JUST EGG-TIME FOR ME AND

470
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,866
THE GLOOP.

471
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:16,666
SOMETIMES IT'S WARMER, AND

472
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:18,200
THAT'S WHEN I FEEL SAFEST.

473
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:19,766
SOMETIMES I CAN TELL I'M BEING

474
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,366
CARRIED, OR MOVED ABOUT AND IT'S

475
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:22,366
JARRING ENOUGH THAT I'M NERVOUS,

476
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:23,666
BUT NOT SO ROUGH THAT I'M

477
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:25,366
PANICKING, AND YOU CAN SHAKE ME.

478
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:27,166
BUT MAKE SURE NOT TO DO IT HARD

479
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:28,900
BECAUSE, REMEMBER, I'M FRAGILE.

480
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:33,233
I AM EGG.

481
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,700
THE POINT IS, YOU CAN'T SAY THAT

482
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:35,433
TO MELINDA GATES, SHE'D NEVER

483
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,500
UNDERSTAND.

484
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:38,433
WHAT WIFE COULD?

485
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,766
ANYWAY.

486
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,800
FOR THE RECORD, THERE ARE NO

487
00:12:41,866 --> 00:12:44,333
MICROCHIPS IN THE COVID VACCINE.

488
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,700
THAT RUMOR IS BASED ON THE FACT

489
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,433
THE GATES FOUNDATION FUNDED

490
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,766
RESEARCH YEARS AGO, WHICH IS

491
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,833
FREQUENTLY TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT.

492
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,666
IN THAT STUDY, RESEARCHERS

493
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:54,933
LOOKED INTO CREATING AN

494
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,266
INVISIBLE INK THAT COULD

495
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,566
POTENTIALLY BE INJECTED ALONG

496
00:12:58,633 --> 00:12:59,676
WITH A VACCINE IN ORDER FOR

497
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,709
POPULATIONS LIKE REFUGEE KIDS

498
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:02,633
TO BE ABLE TO RETAIN VACCINE

499
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,966
RECORDS WITHOUT PAPERWORK.

500
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,633
OVER TIME, THE ORIGINAL CONTEXT

501
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,066
WAS LOST, CONTORTED, AND KIND OF

502
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:09,533
TELEPHONED ITS WAY INTO BECOMING

503
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,866
"SOMETHING SOMETHING BILL GATES

504
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:12,566
MICROCHIPS" ON FACEBOOK.

505
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:16,133
A CLAIM WHICH, IF YOU THINK

506
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,933
ABOUT IT FOR JUST A SECOND,

507
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,366
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

508
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:21,233
BECAUSE IF YOUR MAIN CONCERN

509
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,200
IS THAT BILL GATES COULD USE

510
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:26,066
MICROCHIPS TO TRACK YOU,

511
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:27,000
HE CAN ALREADY DO THAT!

512
00:13:27,066 --> 00:13:28,133
THAT'S WHAT YOUR FUCKING

513
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,766
PHONE IS!

514
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,266
NOW, ANOTHER, MORE

515
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,166
REASONABLE-SOUNDING, CONCERN HAS

516
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:33,133
TO DO WITH JUST HOW FAST

517
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,666
THE VACCINE CAME TOGETHER.

518
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:35,200
I WOULDN'T WANT TO GET IT.

519
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:36,766
I FELT LIKE IT WAS TOO RUSHED.

520
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:37,909
I THINK THE WHOLE THING HAS

521
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:39,533
BEEN RUSHED THROUGH TOO FAST.

522
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,366
IT KIND OF CAME REALLY FAST,

523
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:41,566
LIKE, THE VACCINE.

524
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:45,066
THEY MADE UP ONE REALLY FAST.

525
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:46,333
IT WAS DONE WAY TOO QUICK.

526
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:46,800
I JUST... I DON'T FEEL

527
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:48,733
COMFORTABLE WITH TAKING IT,

528
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,966
NOT ANY TIME SOON.

529
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:51,200
I THINK THAT THEY'RE USING

530
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:51,666
THE... THE PUBLIC AS

531
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:54,366
GUINEA PIGS.

532
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:55,609
John: RIGHT, AND THAT DOESN'T

533
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:56,233
SOUND GOOD.

534
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,866
NO ONE WANTS TO BE A GUINEA PIG.

535
00:13:58,933 --> 00:13:59,600
ALTHOUGH, I DON'T REALLY KNOW

536
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:00,300
WHY.

537
00:14:00,366 --> 00:14:01,000
BEING A GUINEA PIG SEEMS REALLY

538
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:01,966
GREAT.

539
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:02,933
YOU CAN EAT A PEPPER WHILE

540
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,700
WEARING THE STEM AS A LITTLE

541
00:14:03,766 --> 00:14:04,266
HAT.

542
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:04,966
RUN AROUND A TINY CITY MADE OF

543
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:06,033
CARDBOARD.

544
00:14:06,066 --> 00:14:07,666
AND BEST OF ALL: YOU GET TO USE

545
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:08,400
THE "GUINEA PIG BRIDGE."

546
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:11,300
GUINEA PIG BRIDGE!

547
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:15,933
GUINEA PIG BRIDGE TRANSPORTING

548
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,300
GUINEA PIGS FROM POINT A TO

549
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:20,066
POINT B.

550
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:22,600
UTILIZING THE LATEST GUINEA PIG

551
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,833
BRIDGE TECHNOLOGY...

552
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:27,300
John: YEAH.

553
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,406
BEING A GUINEA PIG HAS ITS

554
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:28,900
UPSIDES.

555
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:33,400
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

556
00:14:33,466 --> 00:14:35,100
THE INFRASTRUCTURE ALONE

557
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,066
IS INCREDIBLE.

558
00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:37,173
BUT THAT'S CLEARLY NOT THE

559
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:38,800
CONCERN THOSE PEOPLE HAVE.

560
00:14:38,866 --> 00:14:39,909
THEIR WORRY IS THAT WE'RE BEING

561
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:40,566
USED "AS GUINEA PIGS" FOR

562
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:41,433
A RUSHED, UNTESTED VACCINE.

563
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,633
IT'S AN UNDERSTANDABLE THING

564
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,033
TO WORRY ABOUT, EVEN IF SOME

565
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,733
EXPRESS IT IN LESS-THAN-IDEAL

566
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,733
WAYS.

567
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,633
TELL ME WHY YOU'RE CONCERNED.

568
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,166
SIX WORDS: TESTING, TESTING,

569
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:50,566
TESTING, TESTING, AND MORE

570
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:52,733
TESTING.

571
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,833
IT'S IMPORTANT IF YOU'RE GOING

572
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,942
TO PUT SOMETHING INTO YOUR BODY

573
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:56,733
THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY AND TOTALLY

574
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,700
TESTED.

575
00:14:58,766 --> 00:14:59,566
John: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT

576
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:00,533
I ADMIRE ABOUT THAT GUY:

577
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,033
HIS CONFIDENCE.

578
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,533
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN

579
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,900
ANYONE MORE SELF-ASSURED THAN

580
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:07,366
THE MAN WHO JUST PROMISED SIX

581
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:07,966
WORDS, SAID SEVEN, AND COUNTED

582
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:09,066
FIVE, ALL WITHOUT EVEN

583
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:12,866
FLINCHING.

584
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:14,042
THAT GUY IS SO SECURE IN HIS

585
00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:15,733
THINKING, HE CAN BE WRONG ABOUT

586
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,433
NUMBERS ON CAMERA TWICE AND

587
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,533
DO IT WITH A SMILE.

588
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,766
BUT IT'S WORTH UNDERSTANDING

589
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,566
EXACTLY HOW THE VACCINE WAS ABLE

590
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:25,500
TO COME TO MARKET SO FAST.

591
00:15:25,566 --> 00:15:27,266
BECAUSE RESEARCHERS HAD BEEN

592
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,066
WORKING ON VACCINES AGAINST

593
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:31,266
OTHER CORONAVIRUSES FOR YEARS.

594
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,700
SO WHEN COVID-19 HIT, THEY HAD

595
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,700
A SIGNIFICANT HEAD START.

596
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:36,200
"OPERATION WARP SPEED," AS IT

597
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:37,533
WAS FAMOUSLY CALLED, WASN'T

598
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,833
ABOUT RUSHING THE SCIENCE.

599
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,940
IT WAS ABOUT SIGNIFICANTLY

600
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:42,400
CUTTING THROUGH BUREAUCRACY

601
00:15:42,466 --> 00:15:44,000
THAT COULD HAVE OTHERWISE SLOWED

602
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:45,466
IT DOWN, AS THIS VACCINE

603
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:47,333
RESEARCHER EXPLAINS.

604
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,800
DID YOU EVER IMAGINE THAT

605
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:50,866
WE'D BE ABLE TO DEVELOP A

606
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,933
VACCINE IN 12 TO 18 MONTHS?

607
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,600
THE SHORT ANSWER IS NO.

608
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,666
WE'RE ABLE TO COMPRESS THE

609
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:58,233
TIMELINE, SO THAT THINGS WE

610
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,266
WOULD NORMALLY DO IN A LINEAR

611
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,333
FASHION, A TO B, WE ACTUALLY

612
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,333
START THE F AND THE E

613
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,300
AT THE SAME TIME AS A AND B.

614
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:10,100
John: EXACTLY.

615
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:10,366
FLASHBACK

616
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:10,833
THEY TOOK STEPS

617
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,833
THAT USUALLY HAPPEN

618
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,700
SEQUENTIALLY, AND SAVED TIME BY

619
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:14,033
RUNNING THEM SIMULTANEOUSLY.

620
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,142
AND TO BE HONEST, I'M ENVIOUS OF

621
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,033
THAT LEVEL OF EFFICIENCY.

622
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,400
I'D SAVE SO MUCH TIME EVERY

623
00:16:17,466 --> 00:16:18,333
MORNING IF I COULD SHIT, SHOWER,

624
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,366
SHAVE, EAT BREAKFAST, KISS MY

625
00:16:20,433 --> 00:16:20,900
FAMILY, AND BRUSH MY TEETH

626
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:22,200
ALL AT THE SAME TIME.

627
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:23,566
UNFORTUNATELY, I'VE ONLY EVER

628
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:24,733
MANAGED TO DO THREE OF THEM

629
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
AT ONCE.

630
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,166
BUT I'M SO CLOSE TO

631
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:29,166
THAT FOURTH ONE.

632
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:30,800
ANOTHER CONCERN YOU MAY HAVE

633
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,600
HEARD OR SEEN ONLINE, IS THAT

634
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,066
THE PFIZER AND MODERNA VACCINES

635
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:35,466
ARE THE FIRST AUTHORIZED TO USE

636
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:36,466
MESSENGER RNA.

637
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:38,066
WHICH IS TRUE.

638
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:39,800
BUT THAT'S GIVEN RISE TO

639
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:40,966
SPECULATION ABOUT WHAT mRNA

640
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,200
IS CAPABLE OF DOING.

641
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:44,400
BASICALLY, ANYONE TAKING

642
00:16:44,466 --> 00:16:45,476
THESE VACCINES... THEY'RE ALL

643
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,066
DESIGNED TO DO THE SAME THING...

644
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:48,833
IS GOING TO HAVE NEUROLOGICAL

645
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,100
DISORDERS WITHIN ONE YEAR.

646
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,866
MOST OF THE PEOPLE TAKING THE

647
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:54,173
VACCINE WILL BE DEAD WITHIN 10.

648
00:16:54,233 --> 00:16:56,700
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING: YOU

649
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,433
TAKE THE mRNA, IT CREATES PLAQUE

650
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,133
IN YOUR BRAIN AND GIVES

651
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,000
YOU ALZHEIMER'S AND I GOT

652
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:01,300
THE STUDIES TOO.

653
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:02,400
SO, HEY!

654
00:17:02,466 --> 00:17:03,300
YOU THINK THEY JUST PUT FLUORIDE

655
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:04,100
IN THE WATER TO DUMB YOU DOWN?

656
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,333
WHOO!

657
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,333
John: MAN, ALEX JONES IS

658
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,166
HAVING A BLAST.

659
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:09,833
NO ONE ELSE HAS AS MUCH FUN

660
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,900
WHILE MAKING THE WORLD

661
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:12,900
A WORSE PLACE TO LIVE IN.

662
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:14,366
IT'S LIKE HE INVENTED A JETPACK

663
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,766
THAT SPRAYS EVERYONE BENEATH HIM

664
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,733
WITH HUMAN SHIT.

665
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,900
BUT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO

666
00:17:23,966 --> 00:17:24,700
EVIDENCE OR CREDIBLE STUDIES

667
00:17:24,766 --> 00:17:25,533
SUPPORTING ANY OF WHAT HE JUST

668
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,400
SAID.

669
00:17:26,466 --> 00:17:27,566
AS FOR THE CLAIM THAT mRNA

670
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:28,742
VACCINES MODIFY YOUR DNA, IT IS

671
00:17:28,766 --> 00:17:30,633
VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT

672
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,866
THE VACCINE'S mRNA DOES NOT

673
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:34,166
ENTER OUR GENOME.

674
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:36,033
IT DOES ITS WORK FAR FROM THE

675
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,766
CELL'S NUCLEUS, WHICH IS WHERE

676
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,033
YOUR DNA IS.

677
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,066
BUT THE FEAR OF WHAT THE VACCINE

678
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:42,276
CONTAINS, OR WHAT IT COULD DO TO

679
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,533
YOU, SEEMS TO BE COMMON.

680
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,200
SOME EVANGELICALS ARE CONCERNED

681
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:47,700
IT CONTAINS CELLS FROM ABORTED

682
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,600
FETUSES... WHICH IT DOES NOT.

683
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,100
OTHERS WORRY THAT IT COULD

684
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:52,933
CHANGE THE BODY'S INNER

685
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,100
WORKINGS.

686
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,376
YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A FRIEND TELL

687
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,166
YOU THEY'RE WORRIED THE VACCINES

688
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:57,900
CAUSE INFERTILITY.

689
00:17:57,966 --> 00:17:59,900
THOSE RUMORS WERE FUELED BY A

690
00:17:59,966 --> 00:18:01,300
BLOG POST, WHICH FALSELY CLAIMED

691
00:18:01,366 --> 00:18:03,466
THAT PFIZER'S VACCINE CONTAINED

692
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:04,833
INGREDIENTS CAPABLE OF "TRAINING

693
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,300
THE FEMALE BODY TO ATTACK

694
00:18:07,366 --> 00:18:08,566
A PROTEIN THAT PLAYS A CRUCIAL

695
00:18:08,633 --> 00:18:09,766
ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

696
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:10,333
THE PLACENTA."

697
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,700
BUT A FEW THINGS THERE.

698
00:18:11,766 --> 00:18:13,600
FIRST, EXPERTS SAY OF THAT

699
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:14,733
CLAIM, "IT'S A MYTH, IT'S

700
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,633
INACCURATE.

701
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,466
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE

702
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:18,133
TO SUPPORT IT."

703
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,133
AND THERE'S ALREADY PRETTY GOOD

704
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,833
PROOF THAT PFIZER'S VACCINE

705
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,066
DOESN'T CAUSE INFERTILITY,

706
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:24,033
BECAUSE DURING THE TRIALS

707
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,233
LAST YEAR, MULTIPLE WOMEN BECAME

708
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,033
PREGNANT, AND THE ONLY ONE WHO

709
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,300
SUFFERED A PREGNANCY LOSS WAS

710
00:18:29,366 --> 00:18:30,400
GIVEN THE PLACEBO.

711
00:18:30,466 --> 00:18:34,166
SO IT'S JUST NOT TRUE.

712
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:35,342
AND THE FINAL MYTH YOU MAY HAVE

713
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:37,000
HEARD IS THAT THE RISKS FROM

714
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:39,300
THE VACCINE ARE SOMEHOW GREATER

715
00:18:39,366 --> 00:18:42,466
THAN THE RISKS OF COVID.

716
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:43,613
THAT IS A PERCEPTION FED BY

717
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,709
THE CONSTANT CIRCULATION OF

718
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:45,233
MISLEADING HEADLINES ABOUT

719
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,500
PEOPLE FALLING ILL OR DYING

720
00:18:46,566 --> 00:18:48,400
AFTER GETTING THEIR SHOT.

721
00:18:48,466 --> 00:18:51,366
FOR INSTANCE, YOU MAY HAVE SEEN

722
00:18:51,433 --> 00:18:51,900
THIS STORY THAT WAS WIDELY

723
00:18:51,966 --> 00:18:52,966
SHARED ABOUT 23 PEOPLE IN

724
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:54,400
NORWAY DYING WITHIN A WEEK OF

725
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,500
GETTING THE SHOT.

726
00:18:57,566 --> 00:18:59,033
WHICH DOES SOUND SCARY, BUT THAT

727
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,209
HEADLINE IS MISSING SOME PRETTY

728
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:01,300
MAJOR CONTEXT.

729
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:04,366
WHILE THOSE PEOPLE DID DIE,

730
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:05,333
AT THAT POINT IN NORWAY, THE

731
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,633
VACCINE WAS BEING ADMINISTERED

732
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,133
TO THE OLDEST OR SICKEST PEOPLE.

733
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,333
AND A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THEM

734
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,442
WERE, STATISTICALLY, GOING TO

735
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:12,566
DIE THAT WEEK, VACCINE OR

736
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:14,566
NO VACCINE.

737
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:16,933
ON AVERAGE, 400 PEOPLE DIE EACH

738
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,700
WEEK IN NURSING HOMES IN NORWAY.

739
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:20,866
AND WHEN THE WORLD HEALTH

740
00:19:20,933 --> 00:19:23,066
ORGANIZATION REVIEWED THOSE

741
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:24,266
INCIDENTS, THEY DIDN'T FIND

742
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,200
ANY UNEXPECTED OR UNTOWARD

743
00:19:25,266 --> 00:19:27,566
INCREASE IN FATALITIES.

744
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:28,676
WHICH MAKES SENSE... CORRELATION

745
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,100
ISN'T CAUSATION.

746
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,000
THE VACCINE PROTECTS AGAINST

747
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:33,166
COVID, NOT THE CONCEPT OF

748
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:35,633
MORTALITY.

749
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,533
IT IS WEIRD THAT I HAVE TO

750
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,066
CLARIFY THIS, BUT YOU ARE,

751
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:38,366
IN FACT, GOING TO DIE ONE DAY,

752
00:19:38,433 --> 00:19:42,566
MIKE.

753
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:43,433
YEAH, MIKE.

754
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,266
STOP LISTENING TO WHAT JOE ROGAN

755
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,466
TELLS YOU.

756
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:47,400
HE'S A FUCKING MORON... HIS

757
00:19:47,466 --> 00:19:48,600
WORDS, NOT MINE.

758
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,133
THAT ALSO GOES FOR STORIES

759
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,066
YOU MIGHT SEE HYPING UP

760
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:53,033
SCARY-SOUNDING DATA FROM VAERS

761
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,466
...THE VACCINE ADVERSE EVENT

762
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:55,766
REPORTING SYSTEM.

763
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,100
IT'S A DATABASE THAT COLLECTS

764
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,466
STORIES OF MEDICAL EVENTS

765
00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:00,133
FOLLOWING VACCINATIONS.

766
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,533
BUT ANY LAYPERSON HAS TO TREAT

767
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,900
DATA COMING OUT OF IT WITH

768
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:04,233
EXTREME CAUTION.

769
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,033
BECAUSE REPORTS CAN BE ENTERED

770
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,766
BY ANYONE AND ARE NOT ROUTINELY

771
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,733
VERIFIED... ONE RESEARCHER ONCE

772
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,500
CLAIMED THAT THE FLU VACCINE

773
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:13,233
TURNED HIM INTO THE HULK, AND

774
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,533
THAT REPORT WAS ACCEPTED AND

775
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,200
ENTERED INTO THE DATABASE.

776
00:20:18,266 --> 00:20:19,566
WHICH IS COMPLETELY ABSURD.

777
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:20,966
A DRUG CAN'T TURN YOU INTO

778
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:22,333
THE HULK, ALTHOUGH IT CAN TURN

779
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,733
YOU INTO CAPTAIN AMERICA,

780
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,100
THE ONLY SUPERHERO WHOSE ORIGIN

781
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,300
STORY IS "A METRIC TON OF

782
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:29,200
EXPERIMENTAL NAZI STEROIDS."

783
00:20:29,266 --> 00:20:31,100
AND IF WE'RE JUST GOING TO SHARE

784
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,100
RANDOM, UNVERIFIED SIDE EFFECTS,

785
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,966
I MIGHT AS WELL SHOW YOU THIS

786
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,733
TRULY SHOCKING VIDEO ABOUT WHAT

787
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,366
MIGHT WELL HAPPEN TO YOUR MOM.

788
00:20:39,433 --> 00:20:40,509
SO MY MOM GOT THE VACCINE

789
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:41,600
BECAUSE SHE'S A HEALTHCARE

790
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,866
WORKER AND SHE TOLD ME SHE'S

791
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:45,600
EXPERIENCING SOME SIDE EFFECTS.

792
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,066
MOM, WHAT'S THAT SIDE EFFECT

793
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:49,500
YOU SAID YOU'RE EXPERIENCING?

794
00:20:49,566 --> 00:20:52,733
BEING A BOSS ASS BITCH.

795
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,933
John: VERY GOOD.

796
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,009
AND LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING VAERS

797
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:56,033
IS USELESS.

798
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:56,966
IT VERY MUCH ISN'T.

799
00:20:57,033 --> 00:20:59,366
THE REASON THE CDC COLLECTS DATA

800
00:20:59,433 --> 00:21:00,800
FROM IT IS SO, IF A PATTERN DOES

801
00:21:00,866 --> 00:21:01,700
EMERGE, ACTIONS CAN BE TAKEN...

802
00:21:01,766 --> 00:21:03,166
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED

803
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:04,833
WITH THE JOHNSON & JOHNSON SHOT.

804
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,766
THE CDC FOUND A POTENTIAL

805
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,000
PATTERN OF RARE BLOOD CLOTS

806
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,800
AND PAUSED THE ROLLOUT

807
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:12,566
UNDER AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION.

808
00:21:12,633 --> 00:21:14,400
AND WHILE SOME VACCINE SKEPTICS

809
00:21:14,466 --> 00:21:15,400
POINTED TO THAT AS EVIDENCE THEY

810
00:21:15,466 --> 00:21:16,676
WERE RIGHT ABOUT VACCINES BEING

811
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,000
DANGEROUS, IN REALITY, IT KIND

812
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:20,700
OF PROVES THE OPPOSITE.

813
00:21:20,766 --> 00:21:22,300
THAT THE SAFETY RISK OF VACCINES

814
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:23,666
IS RIGOROUSLY AND PUBLICLY

815
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:26,000
ANALYZED, NOT SECRETLY BURIED

816
00:21:26,066 --> 00:21:28,033
AND SOMEHOW LEAKED TO THE HUMAN

817
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,500
FOOTBALL'S NEON SCREAM HOUR.

818
00:21:30,566 --> 00:21:31,833
AND NONE OF THIS IS TO SAY THAT

819
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,020
THERE ARE NO SIDE EFFECTS TO

820
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:33,733
THE VACCINES.

821
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,500
THERE CAN BE.

822
00:21:37,566 --> 00:21:39,100
IT'S JUST THAT SERIOUS ONES LIKE

823
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,466
ANAPHYLAXIS ARE INCREDIBLY RARE

824
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:41,833
...4.7 CASES PER MILLION FOR

825
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,600
PFIZER, TWO AND A HALF CASES

826
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:45,809
PER MILLION FOR MODERNA... AND

827
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:46,700
YOU SHOULD KNOW, THOSE ALSO

828
00:21:46,766 --> 00:21:47,700
OCCUR MOSTLY IN INDIVIDUALS WITH

829
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:51,533
A HISTORY OF SEVERE ALLERGIES.

830
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,800
THE FACT IS, THE VAST MAJORITY

831
00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:55,800
OF PEOPLE CAN EXPECT, AT MOST,

832
00:21:55,866 --> 00:21:57,566
TYPICAL COLD OR FLU SYMPTOMS

833
00:21:57,633 --> 00:21:58,933
IN THE FIRST FEW DAYS AFTER

834
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,100
THEIR SHOT, OR MAYBE JUST

835
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,933
A SORE ARM, OR NOTHING AT ALL.

836
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,666
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH: I GOT MY

837
00:22:05,733 --> 00:22:07,766
SECOND SHOT THIS THURSDAY, MY

838
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:10,966
ARM HURT A LITTLE BIT FOR A DAY,

839
00:22:11,033 --> 00:22:12,100
BUT THAT'S BASICALLY IT.

840
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:12,700
I WILL SAY... THE FOLLOWING

841
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:13,966
AFTERNOON, FOR A COUPLE OF

842
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,966
HOURS, I DID FEEL A LITTLE LIKE

843
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:17,042
A BOSS ASS BITCH, BUT IT PASSED

844
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:18,333
QUICKLY.

845
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,933
AND ANYWAY, THE KEY THING TO

846
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,866
REMEMBER IS THAT NO "SIDE

847
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:22,766
EFFECT" OF THE VACCINE IS WORSE

848
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,433
THAN THE ALTERNATIVE: COVID,

849
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,133
A DISEASE THAT'S KILLED OVER

850
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,933
500,000 PEOPLE IN THE U.S.

851
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,566
ALONE, WHILE, ONCE AGAIN,

852
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:32,166
TO DATE, THE VACCINE HAS BEEN

853
00:22:32,233 --> 00:22:34,666
PROVEN TO KILL EXACTLY ZERO.

854
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:35,900
SO IT'S MORE THAN NATURAL

855
00:22:35,966 --> 00:22:37,466
TO HAVE QUESTIONS.

856
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:38,900
BUT THERE ARE REASSURING ANSWERS

857
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:40,866
OUT THERE.

858
00:22:40,933 --> 00:22:42,733
AND ANYONE JUST THROWING OUT

859
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,976
QUESTIONS WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING

860
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,666
THAT PROBABLY HAS ANOTHER AGENDA

861
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:48,333
ENTIRELY.

862
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,866
BUT THE PROBLEM IS, TO GET

863
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:51,466
ANYWHERE CLOSE TO HERD IMMUNITY,

864
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:53,266
WE BADLY NEED TO CONVINCE ANYONE

865
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:55,900
WHO CAN BE CONVINCED.

866
00:22:55,966 --> 00:22:56,866
THE QUESTION IS, HOW DO WE DO

867
00:22:56,933 --> 00:22:58,200
THAT?

868
00:22:58,266 --> 00:22:59,700
WELL, SOME REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS,

869
00:22:59,766 --> 00:23:01,200
TO THEIR CREDIT, HAVE TRIED TO

870
00:23:01,266 --> 00:23:03,566
REASSURE THEIR VOTERS.

871
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:05,000
ALTHOUGH OCCASIONALLY THOSE

872
00:23:05,066 --> 00:23:08,900
ATTEMPTS HAVE LOOKED LIKE THIS.

873
00:23:08,966 --> 00:23:10,133
LIVE FREE AND BEAUTY

874
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,266
SURROUNDS YOU.

875
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,433
THE WORLD STILL ASTOUNDS YOU

876
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,333
EACH TIME YOU LOOK AT A STAR.

877
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,533
I'M SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY.

878
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,100
I CAN'T SING VERY WELL,

879
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,266
BUT I'M FREE.

880
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:23,433
BE FREE.

881
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,833
BE COOL.

882
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,766
GET THE VACCINE.

883
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,866
I DID, IT WORKS.

884
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:31,166
John: OKAY.

885
00:23:31,233 --> 00:23:32,666
I DON'T LOVE THAT, AND NOT JUST

886
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:33,300
BECAUSE IT'S THE WORST THING TO

887
00:23:33,366 --> 00:23:34,966
COME OUT OF A KENNEDY'S MOUTH

888
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:35,900
SINCE THE BACK OF A KENNEDY'S

889
00:23:35,966 --> 00:23:37,466
HEAD... BUT ALSO BECAUSE,

890
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:39,133
THE TRUTH IS, THAT PROBABLY

891
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,266
DIDN'T CONVINCE ANYONE.

892
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,400
IN RESEARCHING THIS PIECE,

893
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:44,166
EXPERTS REPEATEDLY TOLD US THAT

894
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:45,766
THE VACCINE HESITANT GENERALLY

895
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,133
DON'T RESPOND WELL TO HEARING

896
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,342
FROM POLITICIANS, CELEBRITIES,

897
00:23:48,366 --> 00:23:49,606
OR ATHLETES TELLING THEM TO GET

898
00:23:49,633 --> 00:23:50,733
THE VACCINE.

899
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,866
AND I GET THAT.

900
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:54,333
I'D LOVE TO THINK THAT I COULD

901
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,266
END THIS PIECE, HAVING CAREFULLY

902
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,833
LAID OUT SOME DATA,

903
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,100
WITH A TRIUMPHANT CALL FOR

904
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:00,300
PEOPLE TO GET VACCINATED,

905
00:24:00,366 --> 00:24:02,066
FEATURING A MASCOT OF SOME

906
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:03,533
INCONGRUOUS ANIMAL LIKE,

907
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,066
I DUNNO, A VACCINE CICADA.

908
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:06,466
YOU DON'T THINK THAT'S SOMETHING

909
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:08,133
I'D BE INTERESTED IN DOING?

910
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,309
THE TRUTH IS, WE ACTUALLY DID

911
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:10,366
THAT.

912
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:11,933
WE HAD A VACCINE CICADA COSTUME

913
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,600
MADE.

914
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,000
BUT AFTER BEING ADVISED THAT

915
00:24:15,066 --> 00:24:16,533
THIS TECHNIQUE WOULDN'T BE

916
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,809
REMOTELY EFFECTIVE IN CONVINCING

917
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,333
PEOPLE WHO WERE HESITANT, WE

918
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,000
SCRAPPED THE IDEA COMPLETELY.

919
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:22,700
WE EMAILED OUR MASCOT GUY AND

920
00:24:22,766 --> 00:24:24,200
TOLD HIM NOT TO COME IN.

921
00:24:24,266 --> 00:24:25,400
BECAUSE IT WAS AN ABSOLUTELY

922
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:27,333
STUPID IDEA.

923
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,866
A VACCINE CICADA?

924
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:30,600
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW DUMB THAT

925
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:32,066
WOULD LOOK?

926
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:34,066
IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T END UP EVEN

927
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:35,409
LOOKING LIKE A CICADA, MORE LIKE

928
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,600
SOME KIND OF UNHINGED COCKROACH.

929
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:39,133
IT WAS A TERRIBLE CONCEPT

930
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,433
THAT COULD HAVE FUNDAMENTALLY

931
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,900
UNDERMINED THE VERY IMPORTANT

932
00:24:41,966 --> 00:24:43,433
MESSAGE THAT WE WERE TRYING TO

933
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
SEND, AND I'M SO GLAD WE AVOIDED

934
00:24:45,566 --> 00:24:48,200
MAKING THAT MISTAKE.

935
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:50,133
THE TRUTH IS, I'M NOT GOING TO

936
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,400
BE ABLE TO CONVINCE THE PEOPLE

937
00:24:51,466 --> 00:24:52,800
IN YOUR LIFE WHO ARE HESITANT.

938
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,300
THE PERSON WITH THE BEST CHANCE

939
00:24:54,366 --> 00:24:57,266
OF DOING THAT IS YOU.

940
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,333
SO IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WORRIED,

941
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,833
FOR WHATEVER REASON, AND YOU

942
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,066
WANT TO CONVINCE THEM OTHERWISE,

943
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:04,600
DO NOT SHOW THEM THIS VIDEO.

944
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:05,909
BUT MAYBE DO TRY AND USE SOME OF

945
00:25:05,933 --> 00:25:07,566
THE INFORMATION INSIDE IT TO

946
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:09,900
TELL THEM YOURSELF AND WHEN

947
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,433
YOU'RE DOING THAT, TRY NOT TO

948
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,676
DISMISS OR JUDGE THEM FOR HAVING

949
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,400
DOUBTS.

950
00:25:13,466 --> 00:25:14,733
AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT ALWAYS

951
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,333
EASY.

952
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,666
I COULD HAVE GIVEN THAT GUY

953
00:25:16,733 --> 00:25:17,666
A PASS FOR HOLDING UP THE WRONG

954
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:18,366
NUMBER OF FINGERS.

955
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,366
I COULDN'T DO IT!

956
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:20,500
I DON'T HAVE THAT LEVEL OF

957
00:25:20,566 --> 00:25:21,833
RESTRAINT!

958
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,833
I'M A SMALL, PETTY MAN, AND THAT

959
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,733
GUY IS A FUCKING IDIOT!

960
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,533
BUT IF YOU THINK YOU CAN

961
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,680
DO BETTER, IT IS INCREDIBLY

962
00:25:30,733 --> 00:25:31,433
IMPORTANT THAT YOU TRY.

963
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,966
OR, TO PUT IT IN TERMS THAT THAT

964
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,666
GUY COULD UNDERSTAND: I'VE GOT

965
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,800
TWO WORDS FOR YOU: PLEASE JUST

966
00:25:36,866 --> 00:25:38,800
TRY AS HARD AS YOU CAN.

967
00:25:38,866 --> 00:25:39,866
AND NOW: THIS.

968
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:45,166
Announcer: AND NOW...

969
00:25:45,233 --> 00:25:47,566
DANA PERINO GREW UP ON A RANCH.

970
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:49,566
TO SPEAK OF THE DEMOCRATS ARE

971
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,133
PLOWING OLD GROUND OVER AND

972
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,100
OVER AGAIN, AND I GREW UP ON A

973
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:53,566
RANCH.

974
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:55,633
MOUNT RUSHMORE, ONE OF MY

975
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,766
VERY FAVORITE PLACES.

976
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:58,200
WENT THERE EVERY YEAR AS A KID

977
00:25:58,266 --> 00:26:00,766
TO VISIT, NEAR MY GRANDPARENTS'

978
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:01,066
RANCH.

979
00:26:01,133 --> 00:26:03,266
IN MY RANCH, WE HAD A DOG NAMED

980
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:04,166
CHOCO AND MY SISTER AND I

981
00:26:04,233 --> 00:26:06,333
BROUGHT HOME A CAT FROM THE

982
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:06,700
RANCH.

983
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:09,266
IN NEWCASTLE, WYOMING, AND MY

984
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:09,666
GRANDPA'S RANCH.

985
00:26:09,733 --> 00:26:12,900
THAT IS OR MY GRANDFATHER'S

986
00:26:12,966 --> 00:26:13,100
RANCH.

987
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:14,233
MY GRANDFATHER'S RANCH.

988
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,833
HE GOT ME A PONY NAMED SALLY.

989
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,400
MY FIRST PONY WAS NAMED

990
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:18,600
SALLY.

991
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:20,433
WHEN I WAS A BABY, MY

992
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,966
GRANDFATHER BOUGHT ME A BABY.

993
00:26:22,033 --> 00:26:23,366
HER NAME WAS ALLIE.

994
00:26:23,433 --> 00:26:26,300
I HAD A PONY NAMED SALLY.

995
00:26:26,366 --> 00:26:27,933
I HAD SOME OTHER ANIMALS.

996
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,833
MY GRANDFATHER'S RANCH.

997
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,366
MY GRANDFATHER ON MY FATHERS

998
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:33,200
SIDE UP AT THE RANCH.

999
00:26:33,266 --> 00:26:34,506
INTERESTING, HAVING GROWN UP

1000
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:36,366
IN THE MOUNTAIN WEST, RANCHING

1001
00:26:36,433 --> 00:26:38,200
FAMILY, THAT IS WHERE I COME

1002
00:26:38,266 --> 00:26:39,000
FROM.

1003
00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:40,100
RANCHING FAMILY.

1004
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:40,900
RANCHING FAMILY.

1005
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,933
I REMEMBER GROWING UP ON THE

1006
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,133
RANCH.

1007
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,900
I LOVE EARLY MORNINGS,

1008
00:26:44,966 --> 00:26:45,800
GROWING UP ON A RANCH.

1009
00:26:45,866 --> 00:26:48,033
I GREW UP IN A CATTLE RANCH.

1010
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:48,800
THE RANCH.

1011
00:26:48,866 --> 00:26:49,000
RANCH.

1012
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,400
I WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT

1013
00:26:51,466 --> 00:26:52,666
THAT RANCH EXPERIENCE SOMEDAY,

1014
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,233
DANA.

1015
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,100
John: MOVING ON.

1016
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:56,176
FINALLY TONIGHT, A QUICK WORD

1017
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,276
ABOUT TWITTER, THE PLATFORM

1018
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,400
WHERE HBO ONCE TWEETED THIS

1019
00:27:00,466 --> 00:27:01,642
POINTLESS LIST COMPARING THEIR

1020
00:27:01,666 --> 00:27:02,333
SHOWS TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF MILK

1021
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,300
AND LEAVING US OUT.

1022
00:27:03,366 --> 00:27:03,900
WHICH IS RIDICULOUS.

1023
00:27:03,966 --> 00:27:04,866
WE EVEN RESPONDED AT THE TIME,

1024
00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:06,500
"WHY AREN'T WE MILK?"

1025
00:27:06,566 --> 00:27:07,600
AND WE NEVER HEARD BACK.

1026
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:08,566
AND WHO IS MORE MILK IN

1027
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:10,633
THE HBO UNIVERSE THAN THIS SHOW?

1028
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,866
WE'RE BOTH BLAND, WHITE

1029
00:27:11,933 --> 00:27:12,766
SUBSTANCES THAT IF INGESTED

1030
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:13,966
TOO QUICKLY WILL ABSOLUTELY

1031
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:15,700
WRECK THE REST OF YOUR EVENING.

1032
00:27:15,766 --> 00:27:17,700
PLUS, EVERYTHING ABOUT MY VISUAL

1033
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:18,800
APPEARANCE SCREAMS:

1034
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:19,333
I WAS JUST SHOT OUT OF AN

1035
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,233
UDDER.

1036
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,700
WE'VE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT HOW

1037
00:27:23,766 --> 00:27:25,200
CORPORATIONS ROUTINELY FAIL TO

1038
00:27:25,266 --> 00:27:26,666
GET WHAT TWITTER SHOULD BE FOR

1039
00:27:26,733 --> 00:27:28,133
...WHICH IS PICTURES OF LONG BOI

1040
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,209
DUCKS AND PHOTOS OF GRITTY

1041
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:30,633
HOLDING A ROCK TO HIS EAR AND

1042
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,842
SAYING HE CAN HEAR THE OCEAN.

1043
00:27:31,866 --> 00:27:34,800
BUT IT'S NOT JUST CORPORATIONS.

1044
00:27:34,866 --> 00:27:36,166
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTS CAN ALSO

1045
00:27:36,233 --> 00:27:37,700
BE DESPERATE TO APPEAR FUN ON

1046
00:27:37,766 --> 00:27:39,000
TWITTER.

1047
00:27:39,066 --> 00:27:40,433
TAKE THE U.S. CONSUMER PRODUCT

1048
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,266
SAFETY COMMISSION.

1049
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:43,300
ON WEDNESDAY, THEY TWEETED OUT

1050
00:27:43,366 --> 00:27:44,700
THIS IMAGE OF A KID ON THEIR

1051
00:27:44,766 --> 00:27:46,533
FATHER'S SHOULDERS,

1052
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,966
LOOKING OUT AT A GIANT,

1053
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:52,700
TENTACLED WASHING MACHINE,

1054
00:27:52,766 --> 00:27:53,633
WITH NO EXPLANATION BEYOND

1055
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,766
THE CAPTION, "AMERICA."

1056
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:55,942
THAT WASN'T EVEN THE WEIRDEST

1057
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:56,766
THING THEY TWEETED THIS WEEK.

1058
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:58,800
ON MONDAY, THEY TWEETED THIS

1059
00:27:58,866 --> 00:28:02,900
PICTURE OF A GIANT WASP IN A

1060
00:28:02,966 --> 00:28:03,700
FAMILY KITCHEN WITH THE CAPTION,

1061
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:04,533
"IT'S NOT ALWAYS THIS EASY TO

1062
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,233
FIND SOMETHING DANGEROUS

1063
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,300
IN YOUR HOME.

1064
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:07,342
CHECK FOR UNSAFE PRODUCTS ON

1065
00:28:07,366 --> 00:28:08,366
Safer.Products.gov."

1066
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:09,533
AND GUESS WHAT HASHTAG THEY

1067
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,866
INCLUDED?

1068
00:28:10,933 --> 00:28:12,633
LOOK AT THIS IMAGE CLOSELY AND

1069
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:18,200
SAY YOUR GUESS OUT LOUD NOW.

1070
00:28:18,266 --> 00:28:19,266
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY WRONG!

1071
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:20,833
IT WAS #LesbianVisibilityDay.

1072
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,433
AND LET'S AGREE: THAT'S

1073
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,266
DEFINITELY THE REPRESENTATION

1074
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:24,833
THE LESBIAN COMMUNITY HAS BEEN

1075
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,333
LOOKING FOR... A REMINDER THAT

1076
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,000
THEY, TOO, CAN BE ATTACKED BY

1077
00:28:28,066 --> 00:28:29,066
RADIOACTIVE WASPS IN A

1078
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:31,333
BLINDINGLY DULL KITCHEN.

1079
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,933
YOU CAN'T BE WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE.

1080
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,733
AND LOOK, I DO GET THEY'RE JUST

1081
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,466
TRYING TO GO VIRAL.

1082
00:28:37,533 --> 00:28:38,966
BUT IT'S NOW HARD TO SEE ONE OF

1083
00:28:39,033 --> 00:28:40,100
THEIR SERIOUS TWEETS ABOUT

1084
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,276
PRODUCT RECALLS, LIKE THIS ONE

1085
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,900
FROM THURSDAY ABOUT A POOL

1086
00:28:42,966 --> 00:28:44,166
HEATER THAT CAN CATCH ON FIRE,

1087
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,000
WITHOUT THINKING, "WHY IS THE

1088
00:28:46,066 --> 00:28:47,209
ACCOUNT THAT ONCE TWEETED THIS

1089
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:48,400
PICTURE OF A CAT RIDING

1090
00:28:48,466 --> 00:28:49,233
A PEGASUS TRYING TO GIVE ME

1091
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,566
SAFETY ADVICE?

1092
00:28:50,633 --> 00:28:53,233
PICK A FUCKING LANE."

1093
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,666
EVEN THE CIA HAS TRIED TO

1094
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,233
BE A FUN ONLINE PRESENCE,

1095
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,400
WITH TWEETS LIKE THIS

1096
00:28:59,466 --> 00:29:00,400
"DECIPHER THE CODE" BRAIN

1097
00:29:00,466 --> 00:29:02,400
TEASER, THE ANSWER TO WHICH IS:

1098
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:03,766
ROSES ARE RED, VIOLETS ARE BLUE.

1099
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,333
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY FROM

1100
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,466
THE CIA TO YOU!"

1101
00:29:08,533 --> 00:29:10,566
WHICH NOT ONLY ISN'T CHARMING,

1102
00:29:10,633 --> 00:29:12,166
IT'S ALSO THE CODE PHRASE

1103
00:29:12,233 --> 00:29:13,242
TRIGGERING A UKRAINIAN SLEEPER

1104
00:29:13,266 --> 00:29:14,400
AGENT TO PICK UP HIS SNIPER

1105
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:16,466
RIFLE AND GET TO WORK.

1106
00:29:16,533 --> 00:29:19,133
THE ONE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT THAT

1107
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,800
SEEMS TO KNOW WHAT IT'S DOING IS

1108
00:29:20,866 --> 00:29:22,833
NEW JERSEY'S STATE ACCOUNT, WHO

1109
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,433
ONCE REPLIED TO THE QUESTION,

1110
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,233
"WHO LET NEW JERSEY HAVE A

1111
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,666

1112
00:29:26,733 --> 00:29:28,300
WITH THE ANSWER, "YOUR MOM."

1113
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:29,376
AND ALSO REPLIED TO A TWEET

1114
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,800
MAKING FUN OF THE STATE WITH,

1115
00:29:30,866 --> 00:29:34,933
"THAT'S NOT WHAT YOUR MOM SAID."

1116
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,766
WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT.

1117
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:37,200
THEY KNOW WHAT THEIR BRAND IS:

1118
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:38,533
14-YEAR-OLD WISEASS CLAIMING TO

1119
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,000
HAVE PLOWED OUR MOTHERS NIGHTLY.

1120
00:29:40,066 --> 00:29:42,066
AND THEY EXECUTE IT WELL.

1121
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:44,500
BUT PERHAPS THE SADDEST EXAMPLE

1122
00:29:44,566 --> 00:29:46,033
OF GOVERNMENT TWITTER IS THE

1123
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,300
U.S. CYBER COMMAND'S NATIONAL

1124
00:29:47,366 --> 00:29:48,600
MISSION FORCE ACCOUNT, WHICH

1125
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:50,333
LAST YEAR TWEETED THIS IMAGE OF

1126
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,500
A RUSSIAN BEAR DROPPING CANDY,

1127
00:29:52,566 --> 00:29:54,100
LABELED WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF

1128
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:55,233
MALWARE.

1129
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,342
AND WHAT EXACTLY WAS THE POINT

1130
00:29:56,366 --> 00:29:57,500
OF THIS?

1131
00:29:57,566 --> 00:29:59,300
DID THEY THINK THIS WOULD

1132
00:29:59,366 --> 00:30:01,433
GO VIRAL AND EVERYONE WOULD

1133
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,866
SUDDENLY BE INTO CYBERSECURITY

1134
00:30:02,933 --> 00:30:04,733
ALERTS?

1135
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,840
DID THEY THINK DRAKE WOULD

1136
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,066
RETWEET IT WITH A BUNCH OF

1137
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:08,433
FIRE EMOJIS?

1138
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,366
OR THAT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT

1139
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:10,766
WOULD REPLY WITH, "FUCK, YOU GOT

1140
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:13,333
US AGAIN!"

1141
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,700
WELL, APPARENTLY, THE RATIONALE

1142
00:30:14,766 --> 00:30:16,500
WITHIN CYBER COMMAND WAS,

1143
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:17,400
"RUSSIA HATES TO BE SEEN AS

1144
00:30:17,466 --> 00:30:19,133
CUDDLY OR COZY, SO WE WANT TO

1145
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,333
TICK THEM OFF."

1146
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,633
AND THEY TRIED TO DO THAT WITH

1147
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,066
THIS MEME.

1148
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:24,600
WHICH TOOK A DEPRESSING AMOUNT

1149
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:26,100
OF EFFORT.

1150
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:27,600
THANKS TO A FREEDOM OF

1151
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:28,909
INFORMATION REQUEST, WE NOW KNOW

1152
00:30:28,933 --> 00:30:30,733
THAT, FROM START TO FINISH,

1153
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,233
THE PICTURE OF THAT SOVIET BEAR

1154
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,100
DROPPING MALWARE CANDY TOOK

1155
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:35,400
22 DAYS.

1156
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:36,700
22 DAYS!

1157
00:30:36,766 --> 00:30:39,966
FOR THAT!

1158
00:30:40,033 --> 00:30:40,866
THAT IS PATHETIC.

1159
00:30:40,933 --> 00:30:41,942
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER

1160
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:42,966
THAT, TO DATE, IT'S GOT

1161
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,800
A GRAND TOTAL OF 441 LIKES.

1162
00:30:45,866 --> 00:30:49,633
22 DAYS FOR 441 LIKES.

1163
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,466
THAT IS LESS THAN 1% OF

1164
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:52,933
THE LIKES THAT HANK FROM

1165
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,466
"BREAKING BAD" GOT FOR THIS

00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:55,866
TWEET REVEALING THAT HE'S HORNY

1167
00:30:55,933 --> 00:30:57,833
FOR SEX GIFS.

1168
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,866
THE POINT IS, GOVERNMENT TWITTER

1169
00:31:00,933 --> 00:31:01,866
ACCOUNTS, PLEASE, STOP TRYING TO

1170
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:02,300
BE FUNNY.

1171
00:31:02,366 --> 00:31:04,466
STOP MAKING BAD MEMES.

1172
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:05,400
STOP TRYING TO DUNK ON FOREIGN

1173
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:06,866
ADVERSARIES.

1174
00:31:06,933 --> 00:31:08,466
AND STOP USING HASHTAGS WHERE

1175
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,709
THEY'RE COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT.

1176
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:12,066
IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE ANYTHING

1177
00:31:12,133 --> 00:31:13,633
AWAY FROM THIS, LET IT BE THAT

1178
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,466
YOU'RE TRYING WAY TOO HARD,

1179
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:17,233
AND THAT FOR SOME ABSOLUTELY

1180
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,133
INEXPLICABLE REASON,

1181
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,933
THIS SHOW IS NOT MILK.

1182
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,300
WHY ARE WE NOT MILK?

1183
00:31:23,366 --> 00:31:24,526
