1
00:00:32,537 --> 00:00:33,733
WELCOME, WELCOME,

2
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,842
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

3
00:00:34,866 --> 00:00:36,531
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

4
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:37,433
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
US.

5
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,562
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF
THE WEEK. AND IT'S BEEN BUSY ONE.

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,266
A FORMER FACEBOOK EMPLOYEE
CONFIRMED WHAT EVERYONE

7
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,008
BASICALLY KNEW, FACEBOOK'S

8
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:46,366
TERRIBLE AND IT'S VERY MUCH BY
DESIGN.

9
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:48,066
OTIS THE BEAR, THE THREE-TIME

10
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:49,600
WINNER OF FAT BEAR WEEK BECAME

11
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,066
THE FOUR-TIME WINNER, BECAUSE

12
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:52,176
MERITOCRACY IS A LIE AND OUR

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,133
SYSTEM IS BROKEN.

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,000
AND IN IDAHO, THERE WAS THIS

15
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:56,666
DRAMATIC POWER GRAB.

16
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:58,166
THERE IS A BLISTERING BATTLE

17
00:00:58,233 --> 00:00:59,766
HAPPENING NOW BETWEEN THE TWO

18
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,133
TOP ELECTED OFFICIALS IN IDAHO.

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,633
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR JANICE

20
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,566
McGEACHIN SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE

21
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:06,966
ORDER BANNING VACCINE MANDATES

22
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,841
IN SCHOOLS AND COVID TESTING IN

23
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:11,040
CERTAIN CAPACITIES.

24
00:01:11,108 --> 00:01:11,908
THE PROBLEM IS THE GOVERNOR,

25
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:14,033
BRAD LITTLE, WAS OUT OF THE

26
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:14,833
STATE WHEN SHE DID IT, AND

27
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,133
QUICKLY PROMISED TO UNDO THE
ORDER.

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,133
YEAH, IT'S TRUE!

29
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:20,766
WHILE THE IDAHO GOVERNOR WAS OUT

30
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:21,666
OF STATE, HIS LIEUTENANT

31
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:22,600
GOVERNOR ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE

32
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:23,809
ORDER TRYING TO BAN SCHOOLS FROM

33
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,033
REQUIRING EMPLOYEES TO BE

34
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,600
VACCINATED.

35
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:27,833
AND NOT JUST THAT... SHE ALSO

36
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,800
SENT THE STATE NATIONAL GUARD A

37
00:01:29,866 --> 00:01:31,533
QUERY ABOUT ACTIVATING TROOPS

38
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,033
AND SENDING THEM TO THE

39
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,600
U.S.-MEXICO BORDER.

40
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:34,433
WHICH IS A PRETTY BOLD MOVE FROM

41
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,700
A SECOND IN COMMAND.

42
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:39,233
IT'S BASICALLY A PLANE'S PILOT

43
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:39,966
GOING TO THE BATHROOM AND THE

44
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,666
CO-PILOT ANNOUNCING, "CHANGE OF

45
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:43,400
PLANS, WE'RE HEADED TO RENO.

46
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:44,600
MY BUDDY SAID HE'D SET ME UP

47
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,233
WITH HIS COUSIN IF I WAS EVER

48
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,747
THERE, AND I SAW A PICTURE OF HER
AND SHE'S AN ABSOLUTE SMOKESHOW.

49
00:01:48,772 --> 00:01:51,239
SO STRAP IN, FOLKS.
IT'S GONNA BE BUMPY ON PURPOSE."

50
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,208
AND THE THING IS, IN IDAHO, THE
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR DOES

51
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:55,800
TECHNICALLY BECOME ACTING

52
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,600
GOVERNOR WHENEVER THE ACTUAL

53
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,700
GOVERNOR LEAVES THE STATE THANKS

54
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:00,433
TO A STATE CONSTITUTION THAT WAS

55
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,100
DEFINITELY WRITTEN LONG BEFORE

56
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,370
CELL PHONES EXISTED, BUT KNOWING

57
00:02:04,395 --> 00:02:05,979
THAT, IT'S PRETTY REMARKABLE

58
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:07,242
THAT BRAD LITTLE CHOSE TO LEAVE

59
00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:08,166
THE STATE AT ALL, ESPECIALLY

60
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:10,400
BECAUSE McGEACHIN HAD ACTUALLY

61
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:11,609
TRIED A SIMILAR STUNT BACK IN

62
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:12,933
MAY WHEN HE LEFT FOR A

63
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,240
CONFERENCE IN TENNESSEE AND SHE

64
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,500
ISSUED AN ORDER BANNING MASK

65
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:18,033
MANDATES.

66
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,466
SO IT FEELS BORDERLINE RECKLESS

67
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:21,095
FOR HIM TO STEP OUTSIDE THE

68
00:02:21,136 --> 00:02:23,439
STATE RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S EVER

69
00:02:23,464 --> 00:02:26,509
DISGUISED WHO SHE IS.
JUST LOOK AT THIS APPEARANCE SHE

70
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:29,025
MADE LAST YEAR IN A VIDEO
CRITICIZING COVID RESTRICTIONS.

71
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,600
WE RECOGNIZE THAT ALL OF US

72
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,133
ARE, BY NATURE, FREE AND EQUAL,

73
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,714
AND HAVE CERTAIN INALIENABLE

74
00:02:36,774 --> 00:02:39,341
RIGHTS, AMONG WHICH ARE ENJOYING

75
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:41,366
AND DEFENDING LIFE AND LIBERTY,

76
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:43,533
ACQUIRING, POSSESSING, AND

77
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,058
PROTECTING PROPERTY, AND

78
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,583
PURSUING HAPPINESS, AND SECURING
SAFETY.

79
00:02:49,608 --> 00:02:50,775
WOW.

80
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,266
THAT IS A RICH TEXT.

81
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,433
ALTHOUGH, I WILL SAY, THAT
REPRESENTS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

82
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,333
BETTER THAN ANYTHING I'VE EVER
SEEN.

83
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,066
AN ELEPHANT?

84
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:00,066
DOESN'T QUITE DO IT.

85
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:00,666
A SWIRLY SNAKE SAYING DON'T

86
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:01,233
TREAD ON ME?

87
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,700
NO.

88
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:03,809
BUT A GUN BIBLE AND A MISQUOTED

89
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,800
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE?

90
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:07,366
THAT IS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY I

91
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,990
KNOW.

92
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:10,989
AND IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS GOING

93
00:03:11,014 --> 00:03:15,557
TO BE AN ONGOING PROBLEM, HAVING
TO KEEP A CONSTANT EYE ON THE

94
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:17,466
ULTRA-RIGHT IN THIS COUNTRY, SO

95
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:18,033
THEY DON'T SUDDENLY GRAB THE

96
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,700
WHEEL AND STEER US STRAIGHT INTO

97
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:20,200
HELL.

98
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,633
AND SPEAKING OF HELL, THAT

99
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,533
BRINGS US TO OUR SECOND STORY,

100
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,266
OAN, THE ONE AMERICA NEWS

101
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,966
NETWORK.

102
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:26,566
YOU MAY REMEMBER WE COVERED IT

103
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:27,266
LAST YEAR.

104
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,866
IT'S A FAR RIGHT CHANNEL THAT

105
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:30,366
PEDDLES COVID MISINFORMATION AND

106
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:31,433
CONSPIRACY THEORIES.

107
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,266
WELL, THIS WEEK, WE LEARNED SOME

108
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,966
PRETTY UNSETTLING NEWS.

109
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:36,300
A NEW REUTERS INVESTIGATION

110
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:37,406
BASED ON A REVIEW OF COURT

111
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:39,533
RECORDS REVEALS THAT OANN HAS

112
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,800
FLOURISHED THANKS TO FINANCIAL

113
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:43,033
SUPPORT FROM A SURPRISING

114
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,966
MAINSTREAM SOURCE, AT&T.

115
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:47,966
YUP!

116
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:49,076
TURNS OUT AT&T HAS BEEN UP TO

117
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,233
SOME SHIT.

118
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,133
AND IT'S WORTH NOTING... AT&T IS

119
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,133
STILL, TECHNICALLY, OUR BUSINESS

120
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,733
DADDY, MAKING OAN OUR BUSINESS

121
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,133
STEPSIBLING, AND NOT IN A HOT

122
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,600
WAY.

123
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:01,500
REUTERS REPORTED THAT, IN

124
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:03,200
DEPOSITIONS, OAN'S FOUNDER

125
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:04,533
ROBERT HERRING TESTIFIED AT&T

126
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,709
EXECUTIVES ONCE TOLD HIM THEY

127
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:07,333
WANTED A CONSERVATIVE NETWORK,

128
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,700
AND HE CLAIMS, "WHEN THEY SAID

129
00:04:08,766 --> 00:04:09,909
THAT, I JUMPED TO IT AND BUILT

130
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:11,100
ONE."

131
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,533
AND ONCE HE BUILT THE CHANNEL,

132
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
AT&T CARRIED IT.

133
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:14,842
FIRST ON THEIR U-VERSE SYSTEM,

134
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:17,833
AND THEN ON DIRECT TV.

135
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,333
AND WITH THAT HELP, OAN HAS

136
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,866
GROWN INTO THE TOXIC NETWORK IT

137
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:22,042
IS TODAY, ONE THAT'S HAPPY TO

138
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:23,200
GIVE A PLATFORM TO BATSHIT

139
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:24,433
ELECTION FRAUD THEORIES FROM

140
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,066
AMERICA'S MOST OUT-OF-BREATH

141
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,133
PILLOW FETISHIST, AND ONE THAT,

142
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,100
A FEW MONTHS AGO, FEATURED ONE

143
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,000
OF ITS COMMENTATORS SAYING THIS.

144
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:33,533
DESPITE THEIR BEST EFFORTS,

145
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,766
THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS LEFT

146
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,366
FINGERPRINTS ALL OVER THE

147
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:37,800
COUNTRY, PROVIDING A TRAIL OF

148
00:04:37,866 --> 00:04:40,533
EVIDENCE THAT THE 2020 ELECTION

149
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,866
WAS NOT ONLY TAMPERED WITH, BUT

150
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:44,633
WAS ACTUALLY OVERTHROWN.

151
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,666
ANY AMERICAN INVOLVED IN THESE

152
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:47,942
EFFORTS, FROM THOSE WHO RAN THE

153
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:49,866
VOTING MACHINES TO THE VERY

154
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:52,233
HIGHEST GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, IS

155
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,533
GUILTY OF TREASON UNDER U.S.

156
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,400
CODE 2381, WHICH CARRIES WITH IT

157
00:04:56,466 --> 00:05:01,233
THE PENALTY OF DEATH.

158
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,533
LOOK, I GET THAT WE'RE

159
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,700
WATCHING A CALL FOR MASS

160
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:04,942
EXECUTIONS FROM A GUY WITH, FOR

161
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:06,733
LACK OF A BETTER TERM, "BIG

162
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,266
THEATER KID ENERGY," BUT ARE YOU

163
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,766
REALLY SAYING THOSE WHO RAN THE

164
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:11,433
VOTING MACHINES COULD BE

165
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,100
TRAITORS?

166
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,100
YOU MEAN DOLORES?

167
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,500
DOLORES FROM DOWN THE STREET?

168
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,576
WHO VOLUNTEERED TO SPEND 12

169
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,709
HOURS OF HER... LET'S FACE IT...

170
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:20,733
DWINDLING "NCIS" -WATCHING TIME

171
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,000
DOLING OUT PARTICIPATION

172
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:23,066
STICKERS TO VOTERS?

173
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:24,266
THAT DOLORES?

174
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,666
ALL RIGHT, DEATH TO DOLORES, I

00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:27,333
GUESS.

176
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,666
SORRY, LO-LO, BUT DECAF PITBULL

177
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:31,366
HERE HEARD A RUMOR FROM A PILLOW

178
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:32,100
SALESMAN THAT YOU DESERVE THE

179
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,266
CHAIR.

180
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,500
NOW, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, AT&T

181
00:05:36,566 --> 00:05:38,200
SAYS THAT NO "SENIOR" EXECUTIVE

182
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:39,342
SUGGESTED TO HERRING THAT HE

183
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:40,266
CREATE ANOTHER CONSERVATIVE

184
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,266
NETWORK, WITH THE CARVE-OUT OF

185
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,533
"SENIOR" THERE BEING PRETTY

186
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,633
STRIKING.

187
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,066
THEY ALSO SAY THEY'VE NEVER HAD

188
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:47,633
A FINANCIAL INTEREST IN OAN'S

189
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,233
SUCCESS AND "DO NOT FUND" THE

190
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:49,800
NETWORK, NEITHER OF WHICH IS

191
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:51,366
100% THE ISSUE HERE.

192
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:56,333
THEY ALSO CLAIM THE ONLY REASON

193
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:56,966
OAN WAS ON DIRECTV WAS THAT THE

194
00:05:57,033 --> 00:06:01,200
NETWORK HAD SUED THEM.

195
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:01,600
AND OKAY!

196
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:02,166
I GUESS THE LARGEST TELECOM

197
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:02,800
COMPANY IN THE WORLD GOT ROLLED

198
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:03,433
IN A LAWSUIT BY A RAGTAG BAND OF

199
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,333
FASCISTS.

200
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,600
IT HAPPENS!

201
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:08,600
BUT THE LARGER POINT IS, OAN

202
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:09,400
WOULD BE LITERALLY NOTHING

203
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:11,133
WITHOUT AT&T.

204
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,866
AN OAN ACCOUNTANT REPORTEDLY

205
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:12,866
SAID, UNDER OATH, THAT AT&T

206
00:06:12,933 --> 00:06:16,100
PROVIDED 90% OF HERRING

207
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,700
NETWORKS' INCOME.

208
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:20,033
AS FOR OAN'S HORRENDOUS CONTENT,

209
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,266
AT&T TOLD US DIRECTV RESPECTS

210
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,733
THE EDITORIAL INDEPENDENCE OF

211
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,500
THE CHANNELS IT CARRIES, JUST AS

212
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:28,600
AT&T IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING

213
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,742
EDITORIAL INDEPENDENCE FOR EVERY

214
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:30,933
WARNER MEDIA SHOW, INCLUDING

215
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,733
THIS ONE.

216
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,266
AND THAT IS SUCH A RELIEF!

217
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,000
ESPECIALLY THAT LAST PART.

218
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:38,800
BECAUSE IF I MAY, I'D LIKE TO

219
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:40,000
USE THAT GENEROUS EDITORIAL

220
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,333
INDEPENDENCE TO OFFER SOME

221
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,633
CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK.

222
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,866
TAKE AT&T'S RECENT CAMPAIGN.

223
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:49,142
"MORE FOR YOUR THING, THAT'S OUR

224
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:49,866
THING," WHICH IS, RESPECTFULLY,

225
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:52,333
COMPLETE GIBBERISH.

226
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,200
IT SOUNDS LIKE YODA PITCHING A

227
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:55,166
PENIS-ENLARGEMENT DEVICE.

228
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:56,342
IT'S SO NONSENSICAL I HAVE TO

229
00:06:56,366 --> 00:06:56,966
ASSUME SOMETHING WAS LOST IN

230
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:58,466
COMMUNICATION, WHICH ACTUALLY

231
00:06:58,533 --> 00:06:59,542
WOULD BE A MUCH MORE APPROPRIATE

232
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:02,000
SLOGAN FOR THE COMPANY.

233
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:03,433
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE THAT,

234
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,200
AT&T, DON'T WORRY, I'VE GOT

235
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:05,366
MORE.

236
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:07,500
HOW ABOUT "AT&T, ALL THE

237
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:08,300
BUSINESS SAVVY OF QUIBI WITHOUT

238
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:08,833
THE COURTESY OF COMMITTING

239
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,566
CORPORATE SUICIDE."

240
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:12,500
OR "AT&T, IF YOU RUN A CABLE OUT

241
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:13,676
THE BACK OF YOUR HEADQUARTERS

242
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,800
AND PLUG IT INTO T-MOBILE'S

243
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:16,033
NETWORK WHILE THEY AREN'T

244
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,800
LOOKING, THAT'S LEGAL, RIGHT?

245
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:18,600
ASKING FOR A FRIEND."

246
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,800
ANY OF THOSE ARE YOURS IF YOU

247
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:21,633
WANT THEM!

248
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,766
AND LOOK, AT&T, I KNOW OUR

249
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:24,466
RELATIONSHIP IS A LITTLE

250
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:26,433
AWKWARD, ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU'RE

251
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,766
TRYING TO SPIN THIS BUSINESS

252
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:28,633
BABY OFF IN YOUR DEAL WITH

253
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,633
DISCOVERY.

254
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,033
BUT WHILE WE'RE STILL

255
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,535
TECHNICALLY RELATED, LET ME JUST
SAY THIS.

256
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,967
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE COMPANY.
YOU DO BAD THINGS AND YOU MAKE

257
00:07:36,992 --> 00:07:40,708
THE WORLD WORSE.
PLEASE DON'T BOTHER KEEPING IN

258
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:42,166
TOUCH ONCE THE MERGER'S
COMPLETE.

259
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:44,433
ALTHOUGH THAT SHOULDN'T BE A
PROBLEM.

260
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,433
YOU'RE AT&T.

261
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,366
IT'S NOT LIKE YOUR MESSAGES WILL

262
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,261
GO THROUGH ANYWAY.

263
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:53,787
AND NOW, THIS.

264
00:07:53,812 --> 00:07:56,591
AND NOW, FOX AND FRIENDS AS

265
00:07:56,616 --> 00:07:58,266
BRIAN KILL MEAD LIKES

266
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,164
CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS WAY, WAY

267
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,155
TOO MUCH.

268
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,583
IF YOU READ ONE REPUTABLE

269
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,333
BOOK ON COLUMBUS AND STILL DON'T

270
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,033
THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A

271
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,900
COLUMBUS DAY, YOU'RE NOT PAYING
ATTENTION.

272
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:12,466
HE MARRIED TO WORLD OF THE TIME.

273
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,724
I JUST DID THE MATH, 527 YEARS

274
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:16,816
AGO, CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS
DISCOVERED THE NEW WORLD.

275
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:18,533
WHAT HE DID AS AN EXPLORER

276
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,866
FIGHTING THE ODDS TO DO SO THEY

277
00:08:19,903 --> 00:08:21,608
SAID WAS LIKE GOING TO THE MOON

278
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:24,300
TODAY BUT ONLY MORE DANGEROUS.

279
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:24,933
ONE PERSON DESCRIBED AS GOING TO

280
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,433
THE MOON BACK IN THE 1960s

281
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,300
ONLY MORE DANGEROUS.

282
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:30,833
ONLY IT WAS MORE DANGEROUS.

283
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,600
ONLY MORE DANGEROUS.

284
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:32,809
BASICALLY, HE DID THE EQUIVALENT

285
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,866
OF GOING TO THE MOON IN THE

286
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:35,633
1490s.

287
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,433
NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

288
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,849
ACTUALLY MORE DANGEROUS.

289
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:40,966
I WAS ALMOST THE CHRISTOPHER

290
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:41,633
COLUMBUS OF THE SHOW.

291
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,866
YOU ARE THE CHRISTOPHER

292
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:45,700
COLUMBUS OF PET GIVES.

293
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:50,141
SOME PEOPLE WHO THINK
COLUMBUS IS ACTUALLY SPANISH.

294
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:53,300
I DON'T BUY THAT AT ALL.

295
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,833
I READ FOUR VOYAGES AND TOTALLY
ITALIAN.

296
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,700
COULDN'T BE MORE ITALIAN.

297
00:08:57,766 --> 00:09:00,133
I WAS COLUMBUS FOR HALLOWEEN, NO

298
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,566
PICTURES AVAILABLE.

299
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:02,033
I'M LIKE WHAT YOU TALKING

300
00:09:02,196 --> 00:09:05,500
ABOUT?
MOVING ON.

301
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:06,433
FOR A MAIN STORY TONIGHT, WE'RE

302
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,233
GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE

303
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,566
INTERNET, MAGICAL PLACE WHERE

304
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,566
YOU FIND COMMUNITIES OF

305
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:12,200
LIKE-MINDED INDIVIDUALS LIKE A

306
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:15,400
TIKTOKER WHO CREATED THE STORY

307
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:16,626
ABOUT THINGS NARROWLY FITTING

308
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,233
INTO TIGHT SPACES, SOMETHING THE

309
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,566
SUCCEEDING WEEK BRITISH WOMAN
WAS A BIG FAN OF.

310
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:25,584
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO!
OH, THAT WENT NICE.

311
00:09:25,609 --> 00:09:28,359
THAT LITERALLY FITTED PERFECTLY.
OH, THAT'S NICE.

312
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:34,586
OH, BLOODY HELL, BIT CLOSE FOR
COMFORT, THAT.

313
00:09:34,648 --> 00:09:38,234
STRESSING ME OUT A BIT, BUT THAT
WERE NICE.

314
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:41,805
OH, GO ON!
OH, YES, GO ON.

315
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,515
HOW'D YOU FIND THAT ALL THESE
THINGS FIT, DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

316
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,680
DID YOU JUST SIT IN YOUR HOUSE
AND JUST SEE IF THINGS FIT IN HOLES?

317
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:51,908
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SHE'S ASKING A LEGITIMATE

318
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:54,800
QUESTION THERE.

319
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:56,233
AND I DO THINK THE ANSWER IS
"YES."

320
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,833
BUT SADLY, OUR STORY ISN'T GOING
TO BE ABOUT THE FUN SIDE OF THE

321
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,166
INTERNET.

322
00:09:59,233 --> 00:09:59,833
IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT THE

323
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,733
RAMPANT MISINFORMATION ON IT.

324
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,033
IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE COVERED

325
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,000
MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE, FROM ALEX

326
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:05,566
JONES TO VACCINE MISINFORMATION

327
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:07,266
TO CONSPIRACY THEORIES.

328
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,966
BUT TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO LOOK

329
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:09,733
SPECIFICALLY AT MISINFORMATION

330
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,600
THAT SPREADS AMONG IMMIGRANT,

331
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,333
DIASPORA COMMUNITIES.

332
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,000
BASICALLY, INSTEAD OF STUFF LIKE

333
00:10:14,066 --> 00:10:15,209
THIS FACEBOOK POST IN ENGLISH,

334
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:16,442
TITLED "THE FAKE VACCINATION OF

335
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:17,400
KAMALA HARRIS," WHICH,

336
00:10:17,466 --> 00:10:18,476
INCIDENTALLY, FACEBOOK HAS

337
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,400
FLAGGED AS FALSE INFORMATION,

338
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:24,600
WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT

339
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:28,366
STUFF LIKE THIS POST IN SPANISH,

340
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:30,000
FEATURING THE EXACT SAME VIDEO

341
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:30,866
WHICH... AS OF THIS TAPING...

342
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:31,333
HAS NO SUCH WARNING.

343
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,866
AND THAT ACTUALLY ISN'T THAT

344
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:33,433
SURPRISING WHEN YOU CONSIDER

345
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,066
THAT... ACCORDING TO THE RECENT

346
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:34,666
FACEBOOK FILES EXPOSE... WHILE

347
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:35,166
MORE THAN 90 PERCENT OF

348
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:36,309
FACEBOOK'S MONTHLY USERS ARE

349
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,500
OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND CANADA,

350
00:10:38,566 --> 00:10:39,333
WHEN IT COMES TO THE HOURS THE

351
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,766
COMPANY SPENDS ON MONITORING

352
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,200
MISINFORMATION, LAST YEAR, ONLY

353
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:45,366
13% WERE SPENT ON CONTENT FROM

354
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:47,266
OUTSIDE THE U.S.

355
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,933
SO IT SEEMS THAT FACEBOOK'S

356
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,500
ADOPTED THE SAME GENERAL

357
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,966
ATTITUDE TO MISINFORMATION THAT

358
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:52,076
THE OSCARS TOOK TOWARD BEST

359
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,309
PICTURES FOR THE FIRST 90 YEARS

360
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,200
OF ITS EXISTENCE.

361
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:56,133
BASICALLY, IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN

362
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,333
IN ENGLISH, IT DOESN'T

363
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,133
FUNDAMENTALLY MATTER.

364
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,209
AND THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION

365
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:01,933
HAS REAL CONSEQUENCES.

366
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,009
WHEN A REPORTER RECENTLY TRIED

367
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:04,193
TO FIGURE OUT WHY VACCINATION

368
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:05,533
RATES AMONG LATINO COMMUNITIES

369
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,100
IN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL VALLEY

370
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,200
REMAIN LOW, ONE WOMAN EXPLAINED

371
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:11,466
HER RELUCTANCE LIKE THIS.

372
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:12,766
I'VE LISTENED TO HEALTH

373
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:13,833
LEADERS.

374
00:11:13,866 --> 00:11:15,433
LIKE WHO?

375
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,576
THERE'S A DOCTOR WHO I'VE

376
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,333
HEARD AND SEEN IN SOME

377
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,733
DOCUMENTARIES WHO SAYS THAT THE

378
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,666
VIRUS IS CURABLE.

379
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:24,200
I FOUND ONE OF THE FEMALE

380
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,566
DOCTOR.

381
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:27,742
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR

382
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:28,700
MY PEOPLE OF EL SALVADOR IS TO

383
00:11:28,766 --> 00:11:30,133
SAY NO.

384
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,433
WE SHOULDN'T BE GETTING THE

385
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,766
COVID VACCINE.

386
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,333
HOW DID YOU FIND THIS VIDEO?

387
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,600
MY MOTHER SENT IT TO ME.

388
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:37,733
THROUGH WHAT MEANS?

389
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,466
SHE SENT IT THROUGH FACEBOOK.

390
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,566
WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THIS

391
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:43,709
DOCTOR AND NOT SOMEONE LIKE DR.

392
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:45,600
FAUCI?

393
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,200
I HAVEN'T SEEN DR. FAUCI.

394
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:47,666
NEVER?

395
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:49,466
NO, I HAVEN'T.

396
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:50,866
YEAH, THAT'S NOT GREAT!

397
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:51,500
IS IT?

398
00:11:51,566 --> 00:11:52,466
AND IT'S A PRETTY GOOD REMINDER

399
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:56,933
OF HOW, THANKS TO SOCIAL MEDIA,

400
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,533
IT'S POSSIBLE TO SILO YOURSELF

401
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,100
OFF AND HAVE VERY DIFFERENT

402
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:58,600
EXPERIENCES OF LIVING IN

403
00:11:58,666 --> 00:11:59,666
AMERICA.

404
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:00,666
BECAUSE SHE WAS AWARE OF A

405
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:02,133
DOCTOR FROM EL SALVADOR PEDDLING

406
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,400
BULLSHIT COVID CURES, BUT HAD

407
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:05,866
NEVER HEARD OF DR. FAUCI.

408
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:06,976
AND ON THAT POINT, I HONESTLY

409
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,933
KIND OF ENVY HER.

410
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,300
WHATEVER YOU THINK ABOUT FAUCI,

411
00:12:10,366 --> 00:12:11,733
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE, IT

412
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,500
WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT TO HAVE

413
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,366
SEEN SIGNIFICANTLY LESS OF HIM

414
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,233
OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF.

415
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,800
THAT WOMAN WILL NEVER KNOW THE

416
00:12:17,866 --> 00:12:19,133
DYSTOPIAN HELL OF SEEING FAUCI

417
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,166
SUPERIMPOSED OVER A VOTIVE

418
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:22,833
CANDLE OR HEARING PEOPLE REFER

419
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,066
TO THE VACCINE AS A FAUCI

420
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:26,000
OUCHIE.

421
00:12:26,066 --> 00:12:27,433
SHE ENJOYS AN INNER PEACE I WILL

422
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,000
NEVER KNOW.

423
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:30,333
AND LOOK, WE CLEARLY HAVEN'T

424
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,442
REMOTELY FIGURED OUT WHAT TO DO

425
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:33,200
WITH ENGLISH-LANGUAGE

426
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:34,342
MISINFORMATION YET, AS PROVEN BY

427
00:12:34,366 --> 00:12:34,933
THE FACT THAT WHEN I SAY THE

428
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,166
WORDS "HORSE DEWORMER" OR "THE

429
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:39,233
LETTER Q," YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT

430
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,666
I'M REFERRING TO.

431
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:41,893
BUT WHILE I KNOW IT'S HARD TO

432
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:42,533
IMAGINE THAT THE SITUATION COULD

433
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,100
BE WORSE, WHEN IT COMES TO

434
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,766
NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGE

435
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,966
MISINFORMATION, IT HONESTLY IS.

436
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:50,500
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

437
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:51,800
MISINFORMATION IN DIASPORA

438
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:53,200
COMMUNITIES, HOW EASILY IT CAN

439
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:54,200
BE SPREAD, AND WHAT CAN BE DONE

440
00:12:54,266 --> 00:12:55,033
ABOUT IT.

441
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,176
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

442
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,000
THAT WHILE SOME MISINFORMATION

443
00:12:58,066 --> 00:12:58,933
IS BASICALLY THE SAME IN OTHER

444
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,160
LANGUAGES, IN OTHER CASES, IT

445
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,066
TAPS INTO CULTURALLY SPECIFIC

446
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:03,800
INTERESTS OR FEARS.

447
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,233
FOR INSTANCE, COMMUNITIES WITH

448
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,666
LIVED EXPERIENCE UNDER COMMUNIST

449
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:07,809
OR SOCIALIST REGIMES ARE OFTEN

450
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:08,842
TARGETED WITH MISINFORMATION

451
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:10,233
THAT TRIES TO STOKE FEARS ABOUT

452
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,533
SOCIALISM.

453
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,833
IN FACT, JOE BIDEN'S

454
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,700
UNDERPERFORMANCE IN

455
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:15,600
MAJORITY-LATINO AREAS IN FLORIDA

456
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:16,833
MAY HAVE HAD A LOT TO DO WITH

457
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:22,266
THE FACT THAT CUBAN COMMUNITIES,

458
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:22,900
WERE INUNDATED BY FALSE CLAIMS

459
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:24,000
LIKE THIS.

460
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:25,109
FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS, MANY

461
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:27,500
HISPANIC-AMERICAN VOTERS HAVE

462
00:13:27,566 --> 00:13:28,609
SEEN REPORTS AND IMAGES TRYING

463
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:31,133
TO TIE JOE BIDEN TO SOCIALISM.

464
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,700
FOR INSTANCE, THIS PHOTO HAS

465
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:32,809
BEEN FLOATING AROUND ON SOCIAL

466
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:33,900
MEDIA.

467
00:13:33,966 --> 00:13:35,433
IT CLAIMS TO BE JILL BIDEN NEXT

468
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,100
TO FIDEL CASTRO.

469
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:40,033
BUT IN FACT, THIS IS FALSE.

470
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,033
IT'S ACTUALLY A PHOTO OF LATE

471
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,000
NORWEGIAN EXPLORER THOR

472
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:45,166
HEYERDAHL AND HIS WIFE,

473
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:47,600
JACQUELINE BIER.

474
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:48,200
OKAY, THAT PHOTO IS

475
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:49,600
CLEARLY NOT JILL BIDEN.

476
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:50,533
AND THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT JOE

477
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,866
BIDEN.

478
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:53,333
ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS A LOT MORE

479
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,033
LIKE HIM THAN THIS ANIMATRONIC

480
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,633
VERSION AT DISNEY WORLD'S HALL

481
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,266
OF PRESIDENTS DOES.

482
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,366
WHAT IS GOING ON THERE?

483
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:00,600
THAT LOOKS LIKE WHAT WOULD

484
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:01,300
HAPPEN IF AN ELDERLY ANDERSON

485
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:02,533
COOPER GOT A FACELIFT FROM A

486
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,500
PLASTIC SURGEON WITHOUT A

487
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:05,766
MEDICAL LICENSE.

488
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,266
AND SOMETIMES, THE SPREAD OF

489
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,542
MISINFORMATION IS EXACERBATED BY

490
00:14:08,566 --> 00:14:10,066
THE FACT THAT, FOR MANY DIASPORA

491
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:11,433
COMMUNITIES HERE IN THE U.S.,

492
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,666
THERE JUST AREN'T MANY

493
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:13,200
ALTERNATIVES IN THEIR OWN

494
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:14,733
LANGUAGES.

495
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,366
FOR MANY OLDER VIETNAMESE

496
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:17,676
AMERICANS, THERE'S SUCH A VACUUM

497
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,400
OF CREDIBLE NEWS CHANNELS THAT

498
00:14:19,466 --> 00:14:21,000
BROADCAST IN VIETNAMESE THAT

499
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:22,400
MANY TURN TO YOUTUBE FOR THEIR

500
00:14:22,466 --> 00:14:24,700
NEWS, WITH CERTAIN CHANNELS ON

501
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:26,766
IN THEIR HOUSES 24/7.

502
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,500
ONE POPULAR HOST BASED HERE IN

503
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:30,466
THE U.S. IS NGUY VU, WHO BRANDS

504
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:32,100
HIMSELF "KING RADIO."

505
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,409
HE'S BASICALLY A VIETNAMESE ALEX

506
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:34,366
JONES, AS YOU CAN SEE IN RANTS

507
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:37,300
LIKE THESE.

508
00:14:37,366 --> 00:14:37,933
CHINA COMPLETELY HAS CONTROL

509
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,033
OF BIDEN.

510
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,242
THE WHOLE SITUATION WITH HUNTER

511
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:41,700
BIDEN'S LAPTOP AND THE TROVE OF

512
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:44,833
DATA IT CONTAINS, I THINK XI

513
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,566
JINPING HAS GOT HIS HANDS ON ALL

514
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:47,933
OF IT.

515
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,233
GEORGE SOROS WAS PART OF THE

516
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:49,966
FINANCIAL PLOT TO OVERTHROW THE

517
00:14:50,033 --> 00:14:54,600
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

518
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:55,776
WHY ARE WE STILL BEING FORCED TO

519
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,033
WEAR MASKS?

520
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,600
MASKS ARE KILLING PEOPLE.

521
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,566
IF YOU'RE IN A STATE THAT GIVES

522
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:02,833
YOU THE RIGHT TO NOT WEAR A

523
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,366
MASK, AND THEN YOU ENTER

524
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:05,733
SOMEONE'S HOUSE BUT THEY TRY TO

525
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,266
MAKE YOU WEAR ONE, TELL THEM

526
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,266
"FUCK YOU."

527
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,200
I MEAN, YOU CAN SEE

528
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:12,546
WHERE THE ALEX JONES COMPARISONS

529
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,866
COME FROM.

530
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:14,942
BOTH HAVE VOICES THAT SOUND LIKE

531
00:15:14,966 --> 00:15:16,100
BONES GOING THROUGH A WOOD

532
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,376
CHIPPER, BOTH HAVE AN INABILITY

533
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,966
TO CONTROL THE VOLUME OF SAID

534
00:15:19,033 --> 00:15:21,700
VOICES, AND BOTH HAVE SETS

535
00:15:21,766 --> 00:15:22,333
CLEARLY INSPIRED BY A WINDOWS 95

536
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,933
SCREENSAVER.

537
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,133
ALSO, THEY SEEM TO HAVE THE SAME

538
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,966
BUSINESS MODEL WITH KING RADIO

539
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:29,233
SELLING HIS AUDIENCE VIAGRA,

540
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,833
MEDICATIONS, AND BEAUTY CREAMS

541
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,909
THAT HE CLAIMS ARE MADE BY HIS

542
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:32,933
COUSIN.

543
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,200
WHICH SHOULD BE A HUGE RED FLAG.

544
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:38,000
UNLESS HIS COUSIN IS NAMED STEVE

545
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:39,800
CLINIQUE, I DO NOT WANT ANY

546
00:15:39,866 --> 00:15:42,100
CREAMS FROM THAT INDIVIDUAL.

547
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,100
BUT AGAIN, WHILE ALEX JONES HAS

548
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,233
BEEN REMOVED FROM YOUTUBE FOR

549
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,533
SPREADING MISINFORMATION, KING

550
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,766
RADIO IS STILL GOING STRONG ON

551
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:50,909
THE PLATFORM, DESPITE THE FACT

552
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:53,166
YOU JUST HEARD HIM SAY, "MASKS

553
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:55,400
ARE KILLING PEOPLE," WHICH

554
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:56,300
CLEARLY VIOLATES YOUTUBE'S BAN

555
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:56,933
ON CLAIMS THAT WEARING A MASK IS

556
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,766
DANGEROUS.

557
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:05,500
AND WHAT I GUESS THIS MEANS IS,

558
00:16:05,566 --> 00:16:06,133
ALEX JONES COULD PROBABLY FIND

559
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,266
HIS WAY BACK ONTO YOUTUBE.

560
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:07,833
HE JUST NEEDS TO COMPLETE A

561
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,600
ROSETTA STONE VIETNAMESE COURSE.

562
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:12,300
AND AS BAD AS FACEBOOK AND

563
00:16:12,366 --> 00:16:13,066
YOUTUBE ARE... AND THEY ARE

564
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:14,000
SCREAMINGLY BAD... AT LEAST IN

565
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:15,700
THEORY, THEY CAN BE MONITORED.

566
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,700
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER WAY

567
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:18,300
MISINFORMATION SPREADS THAT'S

568
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:19,633
ACTUALLY INVISIBLE TO MOST

569
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,800
PEOPLE, AND UNFORTUNATELY, ALSO

570
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:23,100
HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST

571
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,766
POPULAR TOOLS OF COMMUNICATION

572
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,200
AMONG IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES, AND

573
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:29,033
THAT IS PRIVATE MESSAGING APPS.

574
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,433
THE BIGGEST, BY FAR, IS

575
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,609
WHATSAPP, OWNED BY FACEBOOK,

576
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:32,433
WHICH IS MASSIVE ALL OVER THE

577
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,433
WORLD.

578
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,300
SO MUCH SO, IT'S BECOME PART OF

579
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:38,400
MANY PEOPLE'S DAILY ROUTINE.

580
00:16:38,466 --> 00:16:40,400
IN INDIA, SENDING "GOOD MORNING"

581
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,400
MESSAGES ON WHATSAPP IS

582
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:43,300
INCREDIBLY POPULAR, MEANING

583
00:16:43,366 --> 00:16:45,733
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WAKE UP TO

584
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,233
RELATIVES HAVING SENT THEM ONE

585
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,376
OF THESE, OR EVEN A VIDEO LIKE

586
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,400
THIS.

587
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:06,233
I WILL SAY, THAT'S AN

588
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,066
AGGRESSIVELY PLEASANT WAY TO

589
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:09,166
WAKE UP!

590
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:10,766
WHEN WE CAME ACROSS THAT MESSAGE

591
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,133
UPLOADED TO YOUTUBE, THE TOP

592
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:13,933
CMMENT WAS SIMPLY "NICE."

593
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,066
WHICH IS PRETTY STRIKING.

594
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:17,600
NOTHING ELSE ON THE PLATFORM HAS

595
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,966
A RESPONSE THAT WHOLESOME.

596
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:21,233
YOU JUST KNOW THE AMERICAN

597
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,409
VERSION OF GOOD MORNING WOULD

598
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:23,066
HAVE A TOP COMMENT LIKE "YOU

599
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:24,400
KNOW WHO HAD A SHIT MORNING?

600
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:25,200
HARAMBE.

601
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:28,066
REST IN PEACE, KING."

602
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:29,966
BUT IT'S NOT JUST WHATSAPP.

603
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:30,533
CERTAIN COMMUNITIES HAVE THEIR

604
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,766
OWN PREFERRED APP.

605
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,500
KOREAN IMMIGRANTS HAVE

606
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:34,066
KAKAOTALK, WHILE MORE RECENT

607
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:35,833
CHINESE IMMIGRANTS USE WECHAT.

608
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,733
AND IF YOU'RE NOT ON THESE APPS,

609
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,266
IT CAN BE HARD TO UNDERSTAND

610
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,409
JUST HOW CENTRAL THEY ARE TO

611
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:42,900
PEOPLE'S LIVES.

612
00:17:42,966 --> 00:17:44,833
THIS TUNE AND LOADING SCREEN

613
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,833
ARE INSTANTLY RECOGNIZABLE TO

614
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,700
OVER ONE BILLION PEOPLE AROUND

615
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,133
THE WORLD.

616
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,366
IN CHINA, WHERE MOST WESTERN

617
00:17:52,433 --> 00:17:52,966
SOCIAL MEDIA IS BANNED, WECHAT

618
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:55,700
IS ESSENTIAL.

619
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:56,833
PEOPLE USE IT TO TEXT EACH

620
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,233
OTHER, ORDER FOOD, HAIL RIDES,

621
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,833
AND PAY FOR THINGS.

622
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,076
OUTSIDE OF CHINA, THE DIASPORA

623
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,800
USES IT TO CONNECT WITH FELLOW

624
00:18:03,866 --> 00:18:05,533
CHINESE SPEAKERS AND ISSUES IN

625
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,966
THE COUNTRY THEY'RE LIVING IN.

626
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:07,700
EXACTLY.

627
00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:09,233
COMMUNICATION, FOOD ORDERS,

628
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,766
TRAVEL, PAYMENT, EVERYTHING, ALL

629
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,366
IN ONE APP.

630
00:18:12,433 --> 00:18:14,200
THAT'S SO MUCH MORE EFFICIENT

631
00:18:14,266 --> 00:18:15,833
THAN THE U.S.-BASED MODEL, WHERE

632
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,909
YOU HAVE ONE APP TO CONVINCE YOU

633
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:18,142
EVERYONE'S HAVING A BETTER TIME

634
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,000
THAN YOU, ONE THAT FUNCTIONS AS

635
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:21,233
AN ENDLESSLY REFRESHING FURY

636
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,600
GENERATOR, ONE FOR PRETENDING

637
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,566
YOU'LL MEDITATE ONE DAY, ONE

638
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:24,933
THAT LETS YOU PAY TOO MUCH FOR

639
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,233
FAST FOOD, ONE FOR HORNY

640
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,700
MISTAKES, AND ONE THAT SIMPLY

641
00:18:27,766 --> 00:18:28,533
LETS YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE VERY

642
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,100
OLD AND THE WORLD NO LONGER

643
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,633
BELONGS TO YOU.

644
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,833
SO I GUESS, IN A WAY, KUDOS TO

645
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,100
WECHAT FOR STREAMLINING OUR

646
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,933
SHARED DIGITAL NIGHTMARE INTO

647
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,133
ONE CONVENIENT PLACE.

648
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,276
SO THESE APPS ARE A CHEAP AND

649
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,833
UBIQUITOUS WAY TO ALLOW PEOPLE

650
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,700
TO STAY IN TOUCH WITH FAMILY AND

651
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:44,400
FRIENDS, AND ALSO GET NEWS AND

652
00:18:44,466 --> 00:18:46,566
SHARE INFORMATION IN THEIR HOME

653
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:47,400
LANGUAGES.

654
00:18:47,466 --> 00:18:49,733
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY APPEALING.

655
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,100
UNFORTUNATELY, THEY'RE ALSO A

656
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:56,133
HUGE VECTOR FOR MISINFORMATION.

657
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,766
THERE IS ACTUALLY A SAYING IN

658
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:57,466
THE LATINO COMMUNITY, IN THE

659
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:58,866
VENEZUELAN AND CUBAN COMMUNITIES

660
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:00,166
ABOUT LA TIA DEL WHATSAPP.

661
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:01,273
IT'S THE AUNT THAT GOES ON

662
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,800
WHATSAPP AND RECEIVES ANY TYPE

663
00:19:03,866 --> 00:19:04,966
OF CONSPIRACY THEORY AND

664
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:06,933
FORWARDS IT TO ALL HER CONTACTS.

665
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,733
WE ALL HAVE SOMEBODY IN OUR

666
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,400
FAMILY LIKE THAT.

667
00:19:09,466 --> 00:19:11,400
OH, YEAH, WE DO.

668
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:13,233
AND IT'S ALMOST COMFORTING TO

669
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,033
KNOW THAT REGARDLESS OF

670
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,566
BACKGROUND, EVERY SINGLE FAMILY

671
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:18,200
HAS ONE MEMBER THAT WHEN ANYONE

672
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:19,309
GETS A MESSAGE FROM THEM, THE

673
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,633
FIRST RESPONSE IS TO GO "OH,

674
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,433
SHIT, WHAT NOW?"

675
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,433
IT'S A TRULY UNIVERSAL

676
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,633
EXPERIENCE.

677
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,709
AND THERE ARE PARTICULAR REASONS

678
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,300
THESE APPS HAVE BECOME

679
00:19:29,366 --> 00:19:29,900
ESPECIALLY FERTILE GROUNDS FOR

680
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:30,833
MISINFORMATION.

681
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,180
FOR INSTANCE, IN MANY COUNTRIES,

682
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:33,866
FACEBOOK... WHICH, REMEMBER,

683
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:36,233
OWNS WHATSAPP... HAS PARTNERED

684
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,409
WITH MOBILE PHONE CARRIERS TO

685
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:39,200
MAKE ACCESSING ITS SERVICES A

686
00:19:39,266 --> 00:19:41,100
LOT CHEAPER THAN ACCESSING THE

687
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,566
REST OF THE INTERNET.

688
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:44,133
SO MISINFORMATION CAN SPREAD FAR

689
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,233
AND WIDE WITHOUT THE SAME

690
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,233
ABILITY TO CHECK IT.

691
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,466
IN BRAZIL, A BROADBAND

692
00:19:49,533 --> 00:19:51,000
CONNECTION CAN COST UP TO 15

693
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,566
PERCENT OF A HOUSEHOLD'S INCOME,

694
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:54,500
ESSENTIALLY MAKING FACT-CHECKING

695
00:19:54,566 --> 00:19:56,033
TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THE AVERAGE

696
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,800
BRAZILIAN.

697
00:19:56,866 --> 00:19:57,909
WHICH IS A TRULY TERRIFYING

698
00:19:57,933 --> 00:20:00,600
THOUGHT.

699
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,709
AND WECHAT HAS ITS OWN FEATURES

700
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:02,233
THAT MAKE SOURCING HARDER TO

701
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,066
FOLLOW.

702
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:04,242
BECAUSE IT HAS A FUNCTION FOR

703
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:08,800
USERS TO SET THEMSELVES UP AS

704
00:20:08,866 --> 00:20:09,500
WHAT'S KNOWN AS SELF-MEDIA...

705
00:20:09,566 --> 00:20:10,133
BASICALLY A PSEUDO "NEWS

706
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,766
CHANNEL," BUT THERE'S A CRUCIAL

707
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,233
LIMITATION THERE.

708
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,409
WHILE FACEBOOK AND TWITTER

709
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:15,066
GENERALLY ALLOW PUBLISHERS TO

710
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:16,833
POST LINKS THAT TAKE USERS TO

711
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,400
OTHER WEBSITES, WECHAT BANS MOST

712
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:19,666
PUBLISHERS FROM EMBEDDING

713
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:21,900
HYPERLINKS IN ARTICLES.

714
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:23,133
THIS MEANS PRETTY MUCH

715
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,966
EVERYTHING IS SELF-CONTAINED ON

716
00:20:24,033 --> 00:20:26,100
THE PLATFORM.

717
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,600
IT'S HARD TO FIND THE ORIGINAL

718
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:35,666
SOURCE MATERIAL AND DEBUNK IT.

719
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:38,300
RIGHT, AND THAT'S A BIG

720
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:38,933
DEAL, BECAUSE WHO YOUR SOURCE IS

721
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,166
MATTERS!

722
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:39,800
A BOOK CALLED "HOW I BROKE RULES

723
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:40,300
AND MADE HISTORY" READS

724
00:20:40,366 --> 00:20:40,933
COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY IF IT WAS

725
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,533
WRITTEN BY RUTH BADER GINSBURG

726
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,833
OR OSAMA BIN LADEN.

727
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,300
SO MISINFORMATION CAN CIRCULATE

728
00:20:46,366 --> 00:20:47,100
FREELY ON MESSAGING APPS, AND IN

729
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,600
CLOSED GROUPS, BASICALLY

730
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,833
INVISIBLE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC,

731
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,533
AND SOMETIMES, WHEN THE MESSAGES

732
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,133
ARE END-TO-END ENCRYPTED, EVEN

733
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,209
TO THE COMPANIES THAT HOST THEM.

734
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:57,466
AND THEY'RE OFTEN BEING PASSED

735
00:20:57,533 --> 00:20:59,233
AROUND BY TRUSTED FRIENDS AND

736
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,600
FAMILY MEMBERS, LENDING THEM AN

737
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,566
AURA OF LEGITIMACY.

738
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:04,400
AND IT CAN BE TRULY EXASPERATING

739
00:21:04,466 --> 00:21:05,642
FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE TO SEE JUST

740
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:06,566
HOW SUSCEPTIBLE THEIR RELATIVES

741
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:08,933
ARE TO THIS BULLSHIT.

742
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,366
SUBREDDITS LIKE "ASIAN PARENT

743
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:12,200
STORIES" ARE FULL OF POSTS LIKE

744
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:15,833
"WECHAT FUCKED UP MY PARENTS."

745
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,366
AND LISTEN TO THIS WOMAN READ A

746
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:18,300
MESSAGE THAT WAS FLYING AROUND

747
00:21:18,366 --> 00:21:19,033
HER SOUTH AFRICAN FAMILY'S

748
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,733
WHATSAPP GROUP.

749
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,366
"PLEASE DO NOT FULL PETROL TO

750
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:24,900
THE MAXIMUM LIMIT.

751
00:21:24,966 --> 00:21:26,233
IT MAY CAUSE EXPLOSION.

752
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,033
THIS WEEK, FIVE EXPLOSION

753
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,433
ACCIDENTS HAVE HAPPENED DUE TO

754
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,166
FILLING PETROL TO THE MAXIMUM.

755
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:32,766
PLEASE DO SHARE THIS MESSAGE.

756
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,566
RESCUE 1122."

757
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:36,033
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT, I'VE

758
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,600
NEVER SEEN IT, SO I DON'T SEE

759
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:38,466
HOW SHE BELIEVES IT.

760
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:39,300
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

761
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:43,000
BECAUSE WHATSAPP SAYS SO, IT'S

762
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:43,200
TRUE.

763
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:44,700
YOUR CAR'S GONNA EXPLODE.

764
00:21:44,766 --> 00:21:51,000
YEAH, IT'S TRUE!

765
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:51,400
I MEAN, IT'S NOT.

766
00:21:51,466 --> 00:21:52,033
YOUR CAR'S NOT GOING TO EXPLODE.

767
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:52,466
WHAT'S TRUE IS THAT

768
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:53,033
MISINFORMATION LIKE THAT IS

769
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,300
EVERYWHERE ON THESE APPS.

770
00:21:54,366 --> 00:21:56,100
OUR OWN STAFF HAS HAD FAMILY

771
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,000
MEMBERS CIRCULATE THINGS LIKE

772
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,346
THESE VIDEOS IN KOREAN PROMOTING

773
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,833
CONSPIRACY THEORIES LIKE QANON,

774
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,042
OR THIS POST ABOUT HOW AYURVEDIC

775
00:22:02,066 --> 00:22:03,866
DOCTORS SAY WE CAN SAVE

776
00:22:03,933 --> 00:22:05,209
OURSELVES FROM CORONAVIRUS, WITH

777
00:22:05,233 --> 00:22:10,633
TIPS LIKE "BOILED BLACK PEPPERS

778
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,266
IN WATER AND ADD LEMON JUICE, IT

779
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:11,833
KILLS THE VIRUS."

780
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,833
WHICH WOULD BE GREAT NEWS IF IT

781
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,033
WAS TRUE, BUT IT ISN'T.

782
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,633
THIS PROBLEM IS SO FAMILIAR TO

783
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,976
YOUNGER GENERATIONS THAT ONE SON

784
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,933
OF INDIAN PARENTS MOCKED IT ON

785
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,533
TIKTOK LIKE THIS.

786
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,709
HERE'S HOW YOU MAKE BROWN

787
00:22:22,733 --> 00:22:23,533
PARENTS BELIEVE LITERALLY

788
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,033
ANYTHING.

789
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,900
YOU'RE GONNA START WITH A PLAIN

790
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:26,500
BACKGROUND AND WRITE WHATEVER

791
00:22:26,566 --> 00:22:28,000
YOU WANT, BUT JUST MAKE SURE YOU

792
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:28,633
WRITE IT IN THIS FONT, THAT'S

793
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,733
CRUCIAL.

794
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,733
NOW, MENTION ANY RELIGIOUS TEXT

795
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,333
AND TALK ABOUT BODY, MIND,

796
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,542
SPIRIT, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

797
00:22:33,566 --> 00:22:34,900
AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU MENTION A

798
00:22:34,966 --> 00:22:36,800
HARVARD SCIENTIST HELPED CONFIRM

799
00:22:36,866 --> 00:22:37,600
ANCIENT WISDOM, 'CAUSE WE LOVE

800
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:38,800
THOSE HEADLINES.

801
00:22:38,866 --> 00:22:39,942
NOW, MAKE A DIAGRAM THAT LOOKS

802
00:22:39,966 --> 00:22:41,500
SCIENTIFIC AND RELIGIOUS AT THE

803
00:22:41,566 --> 00:22:42,400
SAME TIME AND THROW SOME

804
00:22:42,466 --> 00:22:43,033
SANSKRIT ON THERE, DON'T WORRY

805
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,733
ABOUT ACCURACY.

806
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,566
BEAUTIFUL!

807
00:22:44,633 --> 00:22:45,766
NOW, MENTION SOME CHEMICALS.

808
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,200
I CHOSE KANYE AND DRAKE'S NAME

809
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:47,766
AND MADE THEM LOOK LIKE

810
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:48,600
COMPOUNDS.

811
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:49,709
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY'RE

812
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:50,433
REAL OR NOT.

813
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,609
OUR UNCLES AND AUNTIES HAVE PhDS

814
00:22:51,633 --> 00:22:52,533
IN SCIENCE BUT THAT'S NO MATCH

815
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,500
FOR WHATSAPP.

816
00:22:53,566 --> 00:22:54,609
NOW, IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT YOU

817
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:55,466
INSULT WESTERN MEDICINE AND

818
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:56,633
CULTURE AT THIS LAST PART.

819
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,700
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

820
00:22:57,733 --> 00:22:58,433
THREE DOTS, THREE EXCLAMATION

821
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,300
POINTS, CITE YOUR SOURCES, AND

822
00:22:59,366 --> 00:23:00,266
MAKE THE IMAGE QUALITY A LITTLE

823
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,666
WORSE.

824
00:23:01,733 --> 00:23:05,566
AND THAT IS PERFECTION.

825
00:23:05,633 --> 00:23:08,866
YEAH!

826
00:23:08,933 --> 00:23:10,600
ALL IT TAKES IS A FEW

827
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:12,133
SUPERFICIAL LABELS AND STYLISH

828
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,342
CHOICES TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT

829
00:23:13,366 --> 00:23:14,576
SOMETHING WITH NO REAL SUBSTANCE

830
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,400
IS ACTUALLY MEANINGFUL AND GOOD

831
00:23:16,466 --> 00:23:17,400
OR, AS IT'S KNOWN IN AMERICA,

832
00:23:17,466 --> 00:23:19,966
THE MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE.

833
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:25,600
WHILE THAT WAS CLEARLY FUN, THAT

834
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,466
GUY LATER POSTED A FOLLOWUP

835
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,400
SAYING THAT HIS IMAGE HAD WORKED

836
00:23:29,466 --> 00:23:30,700
SLIGHTLY TOO WELL, BECAUSE IT

837
00:23:30,766 --> 00:23:31,366
WAS MAKING THE ROUNDS ON

838
00:23:31,433 --> 00:23:32,542
WHATSAPP, BUT NOT ALWAYS AS A

839
00:23:32,566 --> 00:23:34,900
JOKE.

840
00:23:34,966 --> 00:23:35,800
AND WE'VE SEEN THE VERY REAL

841
00:23:35,866 --> 00:23:36,876
IMPACTS MISINFORMATION ON THESE

842
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,266
APPS CAN HAVE.

843
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,800
IN INDIA, MISINFORMATION HAS

844
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:40,946
BEEN LINKED TO VIOLENCE AND

845
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,833
DEATHS, TO THE POINT WHERE

846
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,600
WHATSAPP FELT IT NECESSARY TO

847
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:46,166
CREATE THIS AD.

848
00:23:46,233 --> 00:23:49,033
MEET KAVYA.

849
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,600
SHE LIVES AWAY FROM HER FAMILY,

850
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:55,033
BUT VERY CLOSE TO THEIR HEARTS

851
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,866
ON THE FAMILY WHATSAPP GROUP.

852
00:23:56,933 --> 00:23:57,966
BUT TODAY, SHE'S A LITTLE

853
00:23:58,033 --> 00:23:59,900
SERIOUS.

854
00:23:59,966 --> 00:24:01,246
FUFAJI HAS FORWARDED SOME RANDOM

855
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,666
FAKE NEWS ON THE FAMILY GROUP.

856
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:03,853
KAVYA CALLED HIM RIGHT AWAY.

857
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,533
KAVYA?

858
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,100
DO YOU HAVE SOME PROOF OF

859
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:06,933
THAT MESSAGE OR DID YOU JUST

860
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,666
FORWARD IT?

861
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:08,266
I JUST RECEIVED IT ON SOME

862
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,466
RANDOM GROUP.

863
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:10,300
AND MADE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT

864
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:13,200
FAKE NEWS CAN CAUSE VIOLENCE.

865
00:24:13,266 --> 00:24:13,733
WE SHOULDN'T CIRCULATE

866
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,433
SOMETHING DANGEROUS, RIGHT?

867
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,833
SHE CONVINCED FUFAJI TO LEAVE

868
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,500
THAT GROUP.

869
00:24:18,566 --> 00:24:19,566
BE LIKE KAVYA.

870
00:24:19,633 --> 00:24:25,900
SHARE JOY, NOT RUMOURS.

871
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:31,366
YEAH, YEAH, SURE,

872
00:24:31,433 --> 00:24:33,233
IT'S A NICE SENTIMENT, BUT IT'S

873
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:33,766
NOT GREAT WHEN YOU HAVE TO

874
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:34,300
PRODUCE A PSA ESSENTIALLY

875
00:24:34,366 --> 00:24:34,933
SAYING, "LOOK, SOME OF WHAT'S ON

876
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,633
OUR SERVICE IS DANGEROUS

877
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,266
NONSENSE AND IF YOU COULD HELP

878
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:36,866
CLEAN IT UP FOR US, THAT'D BE

879
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:37,400
GREAT!"

880
00:24:37,466 --> 00:24:38,200
AT THE VERY LEAST, THEY MIGHT

881
00:24:38,266 --> 00:24:39,342
WANT TO CHANGE THAT SLOGAN TO

882
00:24:39,366 --> 00:24:40,600
"SHARE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

883
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:41,676
KEEPING MISINFORMATION FROM

884
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,533
DESTROYING THE FABRIC OF OUR

885
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,166
SOCIETY BECAUSE WE CLEARLY CAN'T

886
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:46,133
DO IT."

887
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,100
SO WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT ALL

888
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:48,500
THIS?

889
00:24:48,566 --> 00:24:49,733
WELL, IDEALLY, PLATFORMS LIKE

890
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,966
FACEBOOK, YOUTUBE AND OTHERS

891
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:52,766
WOULD BE AT LEAST AS PROACTIVE

892
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:53,666
ABOUT TAKING DOWN MISINFORMATION

893
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:55,233
IN OTHER LANGUAGES AS THEY ARE

894
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,000
ABOUT TAKING IT DOWN IN ENGLISH.

895
00:24:57,066 --> 00:25:02,433
WHICH I KNOW IS A LOW, LOW BAR,

896
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,066
BUT IT DOES SAY SOMETHING ABOUT

897
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:03,733
WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW.

898
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,200
AS FOR PRIVATE MESSAGING APPS,

899
00:25:05,266 --> 00:25:06,133
THAT'S TRICKIER, BECAUSE OF HOW

900
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,800
THEY'RE DESIGNED.

901
00:25:07,866 --> 00:25:09,133
AND EVEN WHEN SOME HAVE TAKEN

902
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,466
STEPS TO SLOW THE SPREAD OF

903
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:11,166
MISINFORMATION, THEY'VE OFTEN

904
00:25:11,233 --> 00:25:13,766
AMOUNTED TO HALF-MEASURES.

905
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:14,842
WHATSAPP, FOR INSTANCE, STARTED

906
00:25:14,866 --> 00:25:16,166
PLACING LIMITS ON THE NUMBER OF

907
00:25:16,233 --> 00:25:18,066
CHATS A MESSAGE CAN BE FORWARDED

908
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:19,033
TO, CAPPING IT AT UP TO FIVE

909
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,333
CHATS AT A TIME.

910
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
WHICH MIGHT SOUND GOOD, BUT IN

911
00:25:22,466 --> 00:25:24,166
PRACTICE, IT LEAVES PLENTY OF

912
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:26,033
ROOM FOR DAMAGE.

913
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,600
IF A MESSAGE IS SENT TO A

914
00:25:28,666 --> 00:25:30,800
WHATSAPP GROUP OF 20, THEN EACH

915
00:25:30,866 --> 00:25:32,500
OF THEM SHARES IT WITH 20 OTHER

916
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:36,933
PEOPLE, AND THIS HAPPENS FIVE

917
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,466
TIMES, IT CAN REACH MORE THAN 3

918
00:25:38,533 --> 00:25:42,633
MILLION PEOPLE VERY QUICKLY.

919
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,500
YEAH, IT CAN STILL

920
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:45,633
SPREAD PRETTY FAR.

921
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,742
AND I KNOW THAT THIS ISN'T THE

922
00:25:46,766 --> 00:25:47,966
MAIN POINT HERE, BUT ALSO HOW

923
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:49,766
MANY OF US ARE IN TWO GROUP

924
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:51,100
CHATS OF 20 DIFFERENT PEOPLE

925
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:52,166
EACH?

926
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,600
AND IF YOU ARE, HOW THE FUCK DO

927
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:55,200
YOU SLEEP?

928
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:56,633
HOW DO YOU GET ANYTHING DONE

929
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,033
WITHOUT CONSTANTLY SWIPING AWAY

930
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,600
NOTIFICATIONS?

931
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:00,500
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING HOLD ON,

932
00:26:00,566 --> 00:26:01,366
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM, JUST MUTE

933
00:26:01,433 --> 00:26:03,333
THEM, THEN HOW DO YOU THEN CATCH

934
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,300
UP ON ANYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED

935
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:05,533
IN THE CHAT?

936
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,500
YOU'D SPEND HALF YOUR DAY

937
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,806
SCROLLING BACK UP JUST SO YOU'D

938
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:09,333
KNOW WHAT THIS GIF MEANT IN

939
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,766
CONTEXT.

940
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,433
MOM SENT THAT?

941
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,133
IN RESPONSE TO WHAT?

942
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,833
I HAVE TO KNOW.

943
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,433
A KEY PROBLEM RIGHT NOW IS THAT

944
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,766
MANY COMMUNITIES DON'T HAVE THE

945
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:20,953
SAME FACT-CHECKING RESOURCES

946
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,833
THAT ENGLISH-SPEAKING ONES DO.

947
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,866
IF SOMEONE SENDS YOU AN ALEX

948
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:26,133
JONES CLIP, YOU CAN RESPOND TO

949
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,000
IT WITH ANY NUMBER OF TRUSTED

950
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:29,100
SOURCES DEBUNKING HIM.

951
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:30,409
YOU CAN SEND THEM SOMETHING FROM

952
00:26:30,433 --> 00:26:32,300
POLITIFACT, OR SNOPES, OR

953
00:26:32,366 --> 00:26:34,300
FACTCHECK.ORG.

954
00:26:34,366 --> 00:26:35,033
BUT IF SOMEONE SENDS YOU A CLIP

955
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,833
FROM KING RADIO,

956
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,533
VIETNAMESE-LANGUAGE

957
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,166
FACT-CHECKING SOURCES ARE THIN

958
00:26:40,233 --> 00:26:41,233
ON THE GROUND.

959
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,200
THERE ARE SOME... THERE'S VIET

960
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:43,166
FACT CHECK, A VOLUNTEER-LED

961
00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:45,100
PROJECT, AND THE INTERPRETER,

962
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:46,500
WHICH WORKS TO TRANSLATE NEWS

963
00:26:46,566 --> 00:26:47,776
ARTICLES FROM REPUTABLE OUTLETS

964
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,833
INTO VIETNAMESE.

965
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,733
BUT THESE ARE OFTEN SMALL

966
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,939
ORGANIZATIONS, AND THE PEOPLE

967
00:26:53,964 --> 00:26:56,392
RUNNING THEM ARE OUTMATCHED AND

968
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:58,307
UNDERSTANDABLY FUCKING
EXHAUSTED.

969
00:26:58,379 --> 00:27:01,471
SO GROUPS LIKE THESE NEED
RESOURCES TO BETTER MATCH THE

970
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:03,370
CHALLENGE THEY'RE FACING.
BUT BEYOND THAT, THERE NEEDS TO

971
00:27:03,716 --> 00:27:05,050
BE PUBLIC PRESSURE ON PLATFORMS

972
00:27:05,075 --> 00:27:07,057
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT ALL FORMS

973
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:08,966
OF MISINFORMATION, WHETHER

974
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:10,500
THEY'RE IN ENGLISH OR NOT.

975
00:27:10,979 --> 00:27:12,929
BECAUSE A WHOLE LOT DEPENDS ON

976
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,400
THIS.

977
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,900
AND UNTIL THEY DO, IF YOU'RE A

978
00:27:16,966 --> 00:27:18,009
MEMBER OF ONE OF THESE DIASPORA

979
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:19,076
COMMUNITIES, YOU MAY NEED TO

980
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,533
PREPARE YOURSELF FOR MORE

981
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,800
DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS WITH

982
00:27:21,866 --> 00:27:25,166
YOUR CRAZIEST UNCLES.

983
00:27:25,233 --> 00:27:27,366
ALTHOUGH THERE'S ONE TINY WAY WE

984
00:27:27,433 --> 00:27:28,866
MAY BE ABLE TO HELP, BECAUSE WE

985
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:29,933
MADE SOME "GOOD MORNING"

986
00:27:29,966 --> 00:27:31,833
MESSAGES SPECIFICALLY TAILORED

987
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,000
FOR YOUR NEEDS.

988
00:27:33,066 --> 00:27:34,333
LIKE THIS ONE, WHICH READS,

989
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,933
"GOOD MORNING!

990
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,120
TAKE EVERY CHANCE YOU GET IN

991
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:38,176
LIFE AND RETHINK SHARING NEWS

992
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,566
FROM A BULLSHIT SOURCE!"

993
00:27:40,633 --> 00:27:42,666
IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO SEND THAT

994
00:27:42,733 --> 00:27:43,400
TO AN UNCLE IN THE MORNING

995
00:27:43,466 --> 00:27:44,300
RATHER THAN, YOU KNOW, SPEAK TO

996
00:27:44,366 --> 00:27:46,800
HIM.

997
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:47,800
OR YOU CAN SEND HIM A VIDEO

998
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,133
MESSAGE LIKE THIS.

999
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:04,066
THAT'S RIGHT!

1000
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:05,200
IT MAY NOT BE THE MORNING

1001
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,166
MESSAGE THEY WANT, BUT IT'S

1002
00:28:07,233 --> 00:28:08,033
DEFINITELY THE MORNING MESSAGE

1003
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,166
THAT THEY NEED.

1004
00:28:10,233 --> 00:28:11,833
AND FOR VIETNAMESE-AMERICANS IN

1005
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,500
PARTICULAR, IF ANY OF YOUR

1006
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,709
RELATIVES HAVE KING RADIO ON IN

1007
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:16,466
THE BACKGROUND 24 HOURS A DAY,

1008
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:17,800
WE MADE A SPECIAL MESSAGE JUST

1009
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:19,200

FEEL FREE TO USE THEM WHEN YOU

1016
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:42,133
CAN'T HANDLE A WHOLE

1017
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,033
CONVERSATION, BUT KNOW THAT YOU

1018
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,466
REALLY HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING.
