00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,720
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,600
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

3
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,400
I'm John Oliver,
thank you so much for joining us,

4
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,240
just time for a quick recap
of the week, which has been busy.

5
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,800
The House finally passed
the big infrastructure bill.

6
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,280
Abba released
it's first album in forty years,

7
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,880
so you know your parents
are fucking tonight,

8
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,640
and the Democrats had
a rough time in Tuesday's elections.

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,440
They lost the Governor's race
in Virginia

10
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,680
and nearly lost
the governorship of New Jersey.

11
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,840
The clearest sign of how much
voters have turned on them was this:

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,480
The truck driver
with no prior political experience

13
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,120
has defeated one of the most powerful
democrats in New Jersey.

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,520
He is republican Edward Durr and
he has won the district 3 Senate seat

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,040
over incumbent Steve Sweeney,
the State Senate president.

16
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,120
Hold on. I know there is
a lot to process there:

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,240
from a surprise upset by a man
with no political experience,

18
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,280
to someone being called one of most
powerful democrats in New Jersey

19
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,440
while looking like Daddy Dinosaur
from "Dinosaurs".

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,040
What I didn't need to be told
is that the name of his vanquisher,

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,120
this man, is "Ed Durr".

22
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,280
Because when you look like this,
the "Ed Durr" is very much assumed.

23
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,120
I see this image
and I immediately know three things:

24
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,320
he's a middle-aged white guy,
his style icon is Larry King

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,880
and his name is, unavoidably,
Ed Durr.

26
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,560
This was a huge upset,
and if you're thinking:

27
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,320
"Maybe Ed Durr
simply captivated people"

28
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,960
"with his unique and powerful
vision for New Jersey",

29
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,640
good luck landing that argument.

30
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,160
Ed, what's the first thing you're going
to do when you get in Trenton?

31
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,000
I really don't know.
That's the key factor.

32
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,640
I don't know what I don't know,
so I will learn what I need to know.

33
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:19,000
Come on, Ed Durr. You could have
answered "lick every door handle"

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,480
or "get to the bottom
of this Epstein thing"

35
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,520
or you could have just said
"Durr."

36
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,640
Any of which would have been
better than "I don't know."

37
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,920
What's he wearing? Black on red?
He looks like he's auditioning

38
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,680
to be the newest member
of My Chemical Romance.

39
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,560
The only time that color combination
is remotely acceptable

40
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,120
is if you're a middle school boy
who wants his classmates to know

41
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,000
that he is gonna buy a gun
as soon as he's old enough.

42
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,240
It's not just Durr's lack of experience
that's troubling.

43
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,800
He's compared Covid-19 mandates
to the Holocaust.

44
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,120
Tweeted that the prophet Muhammad
was a pedophile

45
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,920
and Islam is a false religion.

46
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,120
All of which makes me less concerned
about the things Ed Durr doesn't know

47
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,440
and way more concerned
about the things he thinks he does.

48
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,080
Meanwhile, President Biden traveled
to the COP-26 climate summit,

49
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,880
where world leaders met to tackle
the most urgent issue of our time

50
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,960
and Biden didn't get off
to a great start.

51
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,400
President Biden is at the U.N.
climate summit in Scotland today

52
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,680
and during today's opening session,
he appeared to fall asleep there.

53
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,520
This conference is one of the most
important meetings in history.

54
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,720
Yeah, that's not ideal.

55
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,480
"This conference is one of the most
important meetings in history"

56
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,040
is one of the worst things
someone can say as you nod off,

57
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,200
right up there with
"You may now kiss the bride"

58
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,400
or "In one mile, exit highway"

59
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,480
or "Welcome to Last Week Tonight,
I'm John Oliver".

60
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,960
The conference was full of reminders,
big and small,

61
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,440
of just how serious this situation is,

62
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,520
from the massive protests outside,
to some of the displays within.

63
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,920
For example,
the tiny island nation of Tuvalu,

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,600
which may soon be flooded out of
existence thanks to climate change,

65
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,120
installed this exhibit, depicting
polar bears in life vests

66
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,240
and a penguin in a noose.

67
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,560
Which is a striking image,
and either suggests Tuvalu's plight,

68
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,400
or a tragic situation where a group
of polar bears committed a crime

69
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,920
so heinous, they had to kill the only
witness, an innocent penguin,

70
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,280
and make it look like a suicide before
popping on their getaway life vests

71
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,240
and escaping to start new,
happier lives.

72
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,120
But the main attraction
was clearly the world leaders,

73
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,960
many of whom made big promises,

74
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,080
like cutting back
on coal and methane emissions

75
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,920
and committing
to ending deforestation.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,520
Cumulatively, those promises
could have some effect.

77
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,400
The International Energy Agency says

78
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,320
if all the pledges from COP26 are
fulfilled as promised and on schedule,

79
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,560
global warming can be
limited to 1.8 degrees.

80
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,280
Yeah, 1.8 degrees.
Which sounds okay,

81
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,240
until you remember
the scientific consensus

82
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,200
is that the rise needs
to be limited to 1.5 degrees

83
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,440
and beyond that threshold,
there is a far greater likelihood

84
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,200
of devastating consequences...

85
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,400
And it gets worse, because
that already insufficient target

86
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,200
is predicated on every single country
living up to its pledges,

87
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,480
which seems very unlikely,
because their track record isn't great.

88
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,400
At the COP15 conference
twelve years ago,

89
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,400
rich nations promised to channel
100 billion dollars a year

90
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,560
to less wealthy nations by 2020,
to help them adapt to climate change.

91
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,200
But they're nowhere close to that.

92
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,600
There are things it's okay to take
a decade on and not deliver,

93
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,720
the "Avatar" sequels,
for instance.

94
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,480
Take your time, James Cameron,
no one gives a shit.

95
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,280
I'll give anyone in this audience
a thousand dollars

96
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,360
if they remember either
of these characters' names.

97
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,840
Exactly!

98
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Aid to fight climate change, though,
is something people actually need.

99
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,480
Truth is, while world leaders may be
loudly patting themselves on the back

100
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,560
for pledging a better future
this week,

101
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,400
the last decade of broken promises
should serve as a warning

102
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,520
that we have to keep pushing them,
because this next decade is "it".

103
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,680
Everything on the line, your life,
mine, those sadistic polar bears...

104
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,920
And we all need to take an active role
in waking world leaders up,

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,680
figuratively and sadly,
in one case, literally.

106
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,520
And now, this.

107
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,320
And now: people on TV
saying things wrong.

108
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,000
Dr. Rodriguez
is a board certified internist and...

109
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,000
A virolist... Am I saying that...
A virologist!

110
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,320
You can now listen to Taylor Swift's
new album, it's titled "Folklore"...

111
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,480
Can you help me out?
Fok... Am I saying that incorrectly?

112
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,200
You are looking live, right here,
at Cape...

113
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,880
Canaveral? Am I saying that right?
A rocket is set to take off...

114
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,880
He's always been chivalrous...

115
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,040
- Am I saying that right?
- It was right.

116
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,120
Steve Deely, the director
of Workers for Opportunity,

117
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,080
at the Maknak Center...

118
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,240
- Am I saying that right?
- Macanaw, but thans for having me.

119
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,480
Trending this morning,
a work of art by Bansky...

120
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,880
- Am I saying it right?
- Banksy.

121
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,640
- Banksky?
- Have you not heard of Banksy?

122
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,400
- Yeah, he painted that thing...
- It's the rogue, kind of street...

123
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,120
On the walls and stuff...
Okay, Banky...

124
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,720
- Banksy!
- ... at an auction in London.

125
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,760
- Banky?
- Whatever.

126
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,000
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns electricity.

127
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,520
It's like Oscar Isaac,
in that without its involvement,

128
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,600
nothing in my house
gets turned on.

129
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,520
Electricity is such an integral part
of modern life, it's hard to believe

130
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,200
that we used to have to sell people
on the idea of electric appliances

131
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,480
with ads like this.

132
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,200
When you step inside
the total electric home,

133
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,600
you step into
an entirely new concept in living

134
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,440
organized around electric centers
such as this entertainment center.

135
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,040
The pride and joy
of the man of the house

136
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,400
is the weather control center,
a center that puts you in charge

137
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,200
of the electric heating
and air conditioning

138
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,080
and the electronic air filtering
of the entire house.

139
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,000
Yes, the pride and joy
of the man of the house is,

140
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,000
of course,
the temperature control system.

141
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,600
Invite all your thermo-bros over
on a Sunday, crack open a few brews

142
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,760
and watch
the temperature for hours.

143
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,240
Sorry, ladies, you wouldn't understand.
It's a guy thing.

144
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,720
Specifically, we're going
to talk about the power grid,

145
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,240
the system of generators
that produce electricity

146
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,840
and the vast latticework of wires
that get it to our homes.

147
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,760
The grid is something you probably
don't think about until it goes down,

148
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,280
which has been happening
more and more in recent years.

149
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,640
Millions of texans woke up to cold
homes when the power grid failed.

150
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,440
This video shows lights going out
as parts of the power grid failed.

151
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,320
That power grid failed yesterday

152
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,240
when Hurricane Ida
ravaged parts of Louisiana.

153
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,960
The lights went out
across downtown Detroit,

154
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,240
cutting power to 1400 buildings.

155
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,240
Watch as the lights go out
during a murder trial,

156
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,080
these lawyers left in the dark.

157
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,560
Holy shit! When the lights
go out during a murder trial,

158
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,600
one of two things is happening:

159
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,000
you've either got a power grid
deeply in need of repair

160
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,880
or the murder victim has come back
as a ghost, and is seeking revenge.

161
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,920
Either way,
your priorities have shifted

162
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,640
and it's time to focus
on a much bigger problem.

163
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,040
If it feels like there've been more
outages than usual recently,

164
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,800
that's because there have.

165
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,840
By one estimate, from 2015 to 2020,

166
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,240
the number of blackouts annually
in the United States doubled...

167
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,680
That is not good
for numerous reasons.

168
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,160
The most obvious being,

169
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,520
sitting around without power for
any period of time absolutely sucks.

170
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,760
What are you supposed to do
without TV and the internet?

171
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,240
Go outside?
That's where snakes live, you idiot!

172
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,320
So what else are you supposed to do?
Read a book?

173
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,960
That's where snakes sleep, you idiot!
Why do you think we invented Kindles?

174
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,320
But it's not just inconvenience, losing
electricity wreaks havoc on everything

175
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,600
from sewage treatment plants
to water purification systems,

176
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,880
and can be lifethreatening to people
who rely on medical equipment

177
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,320
like ventilators
and powered wheelchairs.

178
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,800
It's traumatizing, it's terrifying.

179
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,760
For Terhorst, an outage is more
than just an expensive inconvenience.

180
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:29,240
This isn't, like, "I'm going
to lose a casserole in my fridge".

181
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,600
You know?
This is: "I may not be alive tomorrow."

182
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,120
Exactly. This is about much more
than just lost casseroles

183
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,880
especially because, let's be honest:
all casseroles are shit.

184
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,200
They don't rely on specific ingredients

185
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,840
so much as on
"whatever's in someone's house".

186
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,800
Casseroles are a sad smorgasbord
of "other" leftovers

187
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,720
cobbled together to make
a pathetic almost meal

188
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,000
with names like "Tuna surprise"
and "Chicken I'm sorry".

189
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,760
To have a casserole "leftover"?

190
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,960
That's abandoned food that didn't
make the cut "two rounds in a row"!

191
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,360
I'm sorry,
but if that's your only option,

192
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,800
there are worse fates
than being dead.

193
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,720
While things are bad now, they
could get a lot worse in the future,

194
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,000
because the U.S. has a goal of
"net-zero carbon emissions by 2050."

195
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,760
Which we must meet. But one study
estimates that's going to require

196
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,920
a 40-60 percent increase
in peak electricity consumption.

197
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,840
Which does make sense,

198
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,080
if we're switching to electric cars,
cooking and heating,

199
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,560
all that electricity is going
to have to come from somewhere.

200
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,640
And the truth is, if everyone
suddenly had an electric car tomorrow,

201
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,600
that'd be great for the planet,
but could push our grid to the limit.

202
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,520
So tonight,
let's talk about the power grid,

203
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,000
the current state it's in
and what we can do to fix it.

204
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,240
And let's start with the fact that
while I'm saying "grid", singular,

205
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,960
our system is made up
of three grids.

206
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,960
There's the Eastern interconnection,
the Western interconnection

207
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,880
and the Texas interconnection.

208
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,800
It's like major league baseball,
in that there are two dominant groups

209
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,320
and then assholes in Texas
who'd rather make up their own rules.

210
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,000
And it all started in 1882,
right here in New York,

211
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,480
when Thomas Edison unveiled

212
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,280
the country's first central
power station on Pearl Street.

213
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,920
Interestingly, it was then
Edison's sometime rival, Nikola Tesla,

214
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,200
who helped develop the technology
enabling electricity to travel.

215
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,360
Something all the more remarkable,
given Tesla's...

216
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,120
...let's say, eccentricities.

217
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,320
Tesla suffered from bizarre compulsions
like his consuming need

218
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,200
to rescue injured pigeons
and nurse them back to health.

219
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,920
He has an infirmary for them
right outside his bedroom window

220
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,200
where he's trying to heal, some might
have broken wings, broken legs.

221
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,440
And in fact, at one point,
he referred to one bird as his wife.

222
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,440
And he said, when she died,
the inventive spirit left him.

223
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,440
Did it, now?

224
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,040
Look, this isn't the point
of this story or anything,

225
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,280
but if Tesla were alive today
I wonder which would upset him more,

226
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,040
the fact that his name's been co-opted
by history's first edgelord billionaire

227
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,880
or the fact that modern pigeons
have gotten so unfuckable.

228
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,120
I said no. Respectfully,
thank you for the attention,

229
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,520
but I am not interested,
please leave me and my friends alone.

230
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,480
When it was built, our power grid
wasn't just a technical marvel,

231
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,880
it was a civic one.

232
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,800
Until the 1930s,
electricity was a luxury

233
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,680
mainly for dense
urban areas of the country.

234
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,240
After FDR created the Rural
Electrification Administration in 1935,

235
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,080
that began to change.

236
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,280
The REA was set up by the President
and the Congress in 1935

237
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,480
to help farmers to get the power and
the light at a price they can afford.

238
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,280
Here is the first thing
women ask for after light itself.

239
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,240
If you have ever ironed for an hour,
you'll know why.

240
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,760
An electric iron may not
look important to a man,

241
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,080
but it lightens
one whole day's burden for a woman.

242
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,600
Don't worry, with hubby naturally
busy staring at the thermostat,

243
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,600
you'll have plenty to do
to occupy your time,

244
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,280
like ironing his clothes or teaching
a different woman to iron his clothes

245
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,640
and, if there's still time,
pressing the iron to your neck,

246
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,120
just for a moment,
just to feel something.

247
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,640
You thought getting lights
would make things better,

248
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,160
but it only made things
clearer, didn't it?

249
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,440
Didn't it?

250
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,880
In the end, we wound up with
600 000 miles of transmission lines

251
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,560
and around 5.5 million miles
of local distribution lines,

252
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,720
like the ones you might see
outside of your house,

253
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,680
all of which form
our modern electrical grid.

254
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,120
It's been called

255
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,640
"The supreme engineering
achievement of the 20th century."

256
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,480
Which is not to say
that it's completely invulnerable.

257
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,160
When you string wires in the air,

258
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,480
they're subject to interference
from all sorts of things.

259
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,480
A website that tracked disruptions

260
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,040
found there've been over
600 outages caused by squirrels,

261
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,240
over 200 by birds,
53 by raccoons...

262
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,520
and a number of others caused
by everything from snakes to slugs.

263
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,280
And let me just say,
kudos, slugs.

264
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,040
Out of everything on that list,
you're the ones I underestimated.

265
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,440
The nicest thing I can say about you
is that on your best day

266
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,040
you look like sassy poop.

267
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,240
But you really showed us something
by disrupting our power.

268
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,600
So, once more, slugs... Kudos.

269
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,800
But it's not just animals
that can wreak havoc.

270
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,840
There've also been multiple
balloon-based disruptions,

271
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,240
and if you're wondering how on Earth
a balloon could cause a power outage,

272
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,360
the answer is like this:

273
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,120
Shit!

274
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,680
Excellent. Not one single note.

275
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,760
I hope no one standing there was hurt,
but honestly,

276
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,120
even if someone was,
it wouldn't be a dealbreaker for me.

277
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,640
But disruptions have always
been an issue for the power grid.

278
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,000
What makes it especially vulnerable now
is a combination of two key factors.

279
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,720
The first is old age.

280
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,160
Most power lines were constructed
in the '50s and '60s,

281
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,560
with a 50-year life expectancy,
which they're clearly now well past.

282
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,680
And the second is climate change,

283
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,040
meaning there's now more danger
posed by extreme weather,

284
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,800
like hurricanes, tornadoes and
abnormally hot or cold temperatures.

285
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,200
That combo of old equipment and new
climate threats has been disastrous.

286
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,360
The massive camp fire in California
a few years ago happened

287
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,280
because of a drought in the area,
making it essentially a Tinderbox.

288
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,520
In intense winds, some Pacific
Gas & Electric equipment failed,

289
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,120
for a pretty infuriating reason.

290
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,000
This is the hook that killed
84 people.

291
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:57,000
That groove took
about 98 years to wear in.

292
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,960
It's not a defect.

293
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,400
These hooks are what are holding
the electrical lines off the ground,

294
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,280
PG&E's decision was to let these
things hang until they broke.

295
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,360
When this old hook did break,

296
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,400
the power line made contact
with the metal tower,

297
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,480
showering the ground in sparks.

298
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,360
That's how
PG&E started the camp fire.

299
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,200
Let that be a lesson. You can't
just keep something that old in place

300
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,480
and expect it
to keep working forever.

301
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,640
PG&E basically took the same approach
to their equipment

302
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,160
as democrats did with
Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

303
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,680
And in both cases,
it didn't end well.

304
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,440
Basically, we've got a power grid
built in the twentieth century,

305
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,680
that's not equipped to deal with
the needs of the twenty-first.

306
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,640
And if you're thinking:
"Okay, let's upgrade it then!",

307
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,480
you are absolutely right,
but that's also a massive undertaking.

308
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,680
Because there are a lot of fixes,
both small and huge,

309
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,640
that the power grid badly needs.

310
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,800
The small ones,
we don't have time to get into,

311
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,360
like investing in microgrids
and weatherproofing,

312
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,680
as well as better storage capabilities,

313
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,120
so excess power we generate
doesn't go to waste.

314
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,520
But we're going to focus
on the huge one.

315
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,040
Because our shift to renewable energy
is going to require

316
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,440
a fundamental shift
in what our grid looks like.

317
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,480
One of the few benefits
of fossil-fuel plants is,

318
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,160
you can put them anywhere,

319
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,360
that's why most are located
near densely-populated areas,

320
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,320
close to the people they serve.

321
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,480
But you can't just replace
every coal plant with a wind farm,

322
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,640
because that's not necessarily
where the wind is strongest,

323
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,560
and that fact alone
changes everything.

324
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,920
This is a model created by Princeton,
mapping out possible places,

325
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,360
in the U.S., where wind and solar
projects could, in theory, be built.

326
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,240
Aside from some offshore wind farms,
it's mostly in the middle of the U.S.

327
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,280
Another study found that these states
have most of the potential,

328
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,160
yet the people living there

329
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,400
would only make up 30 percent
of the electricity demand.

330
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,760
In a decarbonized future,

331
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,440
we're going to need to get electricity
from here to here.

332
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,280
Right, and you probably
don't even need me to tell you

333
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,600
why this is going to be
an uphill battle,

334
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,000
because as soon as you saw that
graphic and realized updating the grid

335
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,560
was going to require a Princeton
researcher telling a midwestern farmer:

336
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,600
"We need to build something
in your backyard,"

337
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,080
"so someone in California
can power their electric car",

338
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,920
you already called the next eight
election cycles for Republicans.

339
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,560
But there's actually
some good news here.

340
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,840
Because we've already
made considerable progress

341
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,480
in building out renewable energy
power sources.

342
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,720
Last year, for the first time ever,

343
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,400
renewables like solar,
wind and hydropower

344
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,800
accounted for the largest
portion of new generating capacity.

345
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,200
That's good not just for consumers,
but in many cases,

346
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,360
for the communities where
those facilities are built.

347
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,360
In 2019, wind energy projects alone

348
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,400
provided 706 million dollars in land
lease payments to rural landowners.

349
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,320
So entire towns and areas
can benefit

350
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,200
from the money and jobs
renewables can bring,

351
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,360
as this mayor in Wyoming
can attest.

352
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,040
My personal belief is it provides
money, it provides jobs, taxes.

353
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,600
Then I look at the towns
that they're by

354
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,880
and just think of what people have
that they wouldn't have had.

355
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,960
A lot of infrastructure, police cars,
those kind of things.

356
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,160
When I look at a wind farm,
all I think about is Cha-ching.

357
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,920
That's great, though, to be clear,
when you look at a wind farm,

358
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,240
you can't think cha-ching,
that's the cash register noise.

359
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,880
I know you're trying to make a point,
but this is important.

360
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,240
Wind farms go...

361
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,760
That's how wind farms go.
A cash register goes...

362
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,640
A solar farm goes...

363
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,160
A cat on the day everyone
forgot its birthday goes...

364
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,400
A horny cartoon wolf goes...
And again, wind farms go...

365
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,880
Just so we're clear
about how things go.

366
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,880
The physical generation of renewable
energy isn't really the problem.

367
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,400
The key issue
is the transmission of it.

368
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,320
Basically, how do you get that
energy from where it's made,

369
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,040
like a wind farm in Wyoming,

370
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,320
to where it's needed,
which could be a thousand miles away?

371
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,640
And that brings us
to transmission lines.

372
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,520
Because they are
at the absolute heart of our grid

373
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,920
and we are going to need
a lot more of them.

374
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,760
Due to the limitations of our
aging transmission infrastructure,

375
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,600
in some places,
we actually have more electricity

376
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,040
than we have
the capability to transport.

377
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,800
For instance, in Vermont,

378
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,120
they had to put a moratorium
on new solar and wind projects,

379
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,680
because the transmission lines
couldn't carry any more electricity.

380
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,040
So building out new, higher capacity
lines is crucially important.

381
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,000
but so far,
we haven't done nearly enough.

382
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,880
And that's for a couple of reasons.
And the first big one is location.

383
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,960
Stringing power lines across
the country is a logistical nightmare,

384
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,000
unlike interstate gas lines,
which only require approval

385
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,360
from the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission,

386
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,760
with power lines, you must secure
the buy-in from multiple state

387
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,920
and local agencies,
in every state you pass through,

388
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,120
alongside all the individual landowners
whose property you need to use.

389
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,600
There are legitimate reasons

390
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,720
for people to not want
power lines in their backyard.

391
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,920
If it disrupts their farming operation

392
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,240
or goes through
environmentally sensitive areas,

393
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,000
or cultural or sacred sites
for native americans.

394
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,320
Other objections are simply aesthetic.
The fact is, high-voltage lines

395
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,080
capable of carrying more electricity

396
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,680
require bigger towers
than their predecessors

397
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,120
and some people
just don't want to see them.

398
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,200
It's such an issue that some
countries have actually made efforts

399
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,920
to "beautify" their towers.

400
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,440
In Hungary, they decided to build ones
that look like jesters.

401
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,080
In Iceland, they've proposed
these designs

402
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,320
for a project
called "Land of Giants".

403
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,600
And in Argentina, there is "Coloso",
the giant transmission line robot.

404
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,240
At night, Coloso lights up
and can even smile and wink.

405
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,760
I get the smile part, you want
Coloso to come off as friendly

406
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,880
so children aren't terrified
of the giant electrified robot

407
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,440
with glowing monster eyes,
but why does it need to wink?

408
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,200
What is it trying to communicate?
Is it coming on to us?

409
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,080
I feel the same way about Coloso
as I do about that pigeon.

410
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,280
Never in a million fucking years.
No, thank you.

411
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,840
Please stop looking at me like that,
it's making me uncomfortable.

412
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,680
It's my friend's birthday. We're
trying to give her a nice evening.

413
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,320
Although I will keep
the Long Island iced tea.

414
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,440
Thank you and goodnight!

415
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,360
Local opposition can be effective
in killing transmission line projects.

416
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
A few years back,
a company proposed plans

417
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,600
to build 16 miles of new lines
through Pennsylvania.

418
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,080
But local landowners formed
a grassroots group to push back,

419
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,480
even releasing videos like this one
to detail their objections:

420
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,080
I understand everybody needs electric
and everybody has to have electric.

421
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,200
I wouldn't want to be without
electric. But from what I understand,

422
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,760
this is only going to help people
in Western PA, Maryland and Virginia.

423
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:02,240
And what's it do... I chose to live
here and they chose to live there.

424
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,600
So don't make your problem
my problem. That's how I feel.

425
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,080
That is a little maddening.
The mirrored sunglasses don't help,

426
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,720
but it's more than that.

427
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,600
I do get "I don't want
this on my land",

428
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,440
but to make your argument

429
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,520
"I don't want this here,
if it helps someone there",

430
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,680
makes you sound like a dick.

431
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,760
Also: if we don't upgrade the grid,

432
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,720
absolutely everyone is going
to have problems, including you.

433
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,200
It's like saying: "Don't make
your problem my problem"

434
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,440
when your neighbor's yard
is full of bears.

435
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,400
Sure, but when it gets over
that fence, guess what?

436
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,400
It's your problem, too.

437
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,480
When you consider all the hurdles
transmission projects have to clear,

438
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,120
it's no wonder it can take up
to a decade to get new ones approved,

439
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,880
if they're approved at all.

440
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,640
This can make it harder

441
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,800
to bring renewable energy
onto the grid in the first place.

442
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,560
Fewer than a quarter of proposed
energy projects, like solar and wind,

443
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,280
actually ever make it
to commercial operation,

444
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,960
because of transmission hurdles,
and that's not good!

445
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,160
Now, the second big obstacle
to overcome is cost.

446
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,560
Because the truth is,
this won't be cheap.

447
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,040
One study projects decarbonizing
our power grid

448
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,120
could cost 2.5 trillion dollars
over the next decade.

449
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,280
To put it mildly, not everyone
is on board with spending that money.

450
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,000
When Congress was considering
the Clean Future Act,

451
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,480
a bill that would,
among other things,

452
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,800
provide for expanding
our transmission system,

453
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,760
Representative Bill Johnson
refused to entertain the notion

454
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,320
that it could possibly be worth it
and would not back down.

455
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,080
Whether the american people
are stuck picking up this tab

456
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,840
via higher taxes or rate increases
on their utility bills,

457
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:49,400
can you say that they'll receive
a return on their investment?

458
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:56,480
As you look at the cost benefit for
the health and safety of communities...

459
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,840
No, what's
the return on investment?

460
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,120
They're making
a monetary investment

461
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,840
with their taxes
or their rate increases.

462
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,240
What is the return
on their investment?

463
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,920
So, the return on the investment
is access to clean energy.

464
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,080
That's not a return on investment.
It's a monetary thing.

465
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
That's why you make an investment.

466
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,040
Okay, a few things:
One, shut up.

467
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,320
Two, if you had let her talk
for more than two fucking seconds,

468
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,400
she might have told you many studies
have found that it is cost effective.

469
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,120
A federal lab looked into expanding
transmission lines across the country

470
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,400
and found that such a project could
return up to 2.50 dollars in benefits

471
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,040
for every dollar of cost.

472
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,640
Which, as an asshole might put it,
is a return. A return on investment.

473
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,040
But set that aside.

474
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,560
Set aside also, that blackouts
can cost us a lot of money,

475
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,240
as the people of Texas will tell you,
after what happened to them.

476
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,200
There are also many benefits here
that aren't purely monetary.

477
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,520
A cleaner grid
helps combat climate change,

478
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,080
meaning maybe your grandkids
won't die in weekly lava hurricanes.

479
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,160
Which does seem pretty worthwhile.

480
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,920
Framing this purely as a matter
of net profit is so weird.

481
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,320
Like saying: "What's the return
in funding the fire department?

482
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,760
How much money
do we make off that?

483
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,480
Technically none,
but if your house is on fire,

484
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,040
someone will come with a hose
to put it out.

485
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,240
Plus, we get those
sexy firefighter calendars,

486
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,840
full of oiled up fire hunks,
so we get to be safer and hornier.

487
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,000
This is going to require

488
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,480
a lot of compromise
and flexibility from all of us.

489
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,040
But there are ways to overcome
the hurdles I've described.

490
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,120
When it comes to transmission line
location, we can ease concerns.

491
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,080
Not necessarily
by going creepy Coloso here,

492
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,760
we don't have to be winked at,
but we can make sure

493
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,920
people are compensated fairly
for the use of their property,

494
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,320
or place lines,
to the extent possible,

495
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,400
on already "disturbed lands"
like along railroads and highways.

496
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,040
When it comes to cost,
we're finally making some progress.

497
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
The infrastructure bill
that passed the House this week

498
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,600
devotes over 65 billion
to improve the power grid,

499
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,440
with a portion going directly to
transmission upgrades and expansion.

500
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,480
It's a good start,
while also being not nearly enough.

501
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,080
But the key thing going forward

502
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,280
might be to start thinking about this
differently than we currently are.

503
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,320
For too long, whenever
we've experienced blackouts,

504
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,400
we tended to think of it
as "the power grid failing".

505
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,480
But truth is: it's not failing us,
we're failing it,

506
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,680
by asking it to do something
it wasn't designed to do,

507
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,320
in conditions
it wasn't designed to handle.

508
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,280
We need to act boldly and quickly,

509
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,280
as if both our lives and our
shitty casseroles depend on it.

510
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,960
And if we do this,

511
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,920
if we manage to properly
upgrade our power grid,

512
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,400
it'll genuinely be one of the biggest
accomplishments of the 21st century

513
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,680
and one
definitely worth celebrating.

514
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,760
Perhaps with some balloons!
Balloons are so fun, aren't they?

515
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:13,200
Shit!

516
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,960
No! Hold on! I'm okay.

517
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,240
That's our show,

518
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,240
thanks so much for watching,
we will see you next week.

519
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,280
Fuck!
Good night!

520
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,000
Thank you! That's it!
Which way...

521
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,080
I'm gonna go this way!

522
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,600
Is over here?

523
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,640
We'll be back next week!
