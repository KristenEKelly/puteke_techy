1
00:00:27,966 --> 00:00:30,300
HI THERE, WELCOME TO

2
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:32,533
THE SHOW, STILL TAKING PLACE,

3
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:33,233
BUT FOR THE LAST TIME, IN THIS

4
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,434
BLANK VOID.

5
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:36,200
GOD, THAT FEELS GREAT TO

6
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:37,215
HEAR.

7
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,028
THIS MUST BE HOW ENGLAND FELT

8
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,600
WHEN THEY GOT RID OF YOU.

9
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,300
UH, EXCUSE ME, THEY

10
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:43,933
DIDN'T GET RID OF ME, I CHOSE TO

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,333
LEAVE.

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,455
"CHOSE."

13
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:46,542
OKAY, SURE, LET'S GO WITH THAT.

14
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:47,066
HAS ANYONE ASKED YOU TO COME

15
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:47,566
BACK?

16
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:51,200
LIKE, ANYONE?

17
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:52,566
THAT'S A FAIR POINT.

18
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:53,766
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

19
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:56,500
A BOMB THREAT IN WASHINGTON,

20
00:00:56,566 --> 00:00:58,600
DEMOTED FROM HOST IN JEOPARDY TO

21
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,166
RUNNING IT, AND THEN THE LATEST

22
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:01,100
INNOVATION.

23
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:02,333
WORK ROOMS IS USED ON

24
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,108
FACEBOOK'S OCULUS QUEST 2

25
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,633
VIRTUAL REALITY HEADSETS.

26
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,600
THIS IS MY FIRST VIRTUAL

27
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:12,300
REALITY INTERVIEW.

28
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:13,133
HOW ABOUT YOU?

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
MINE TOO.

30
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:14,800
MY FIRST VIRTUAL REALITY

31
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:15,900
INTERVIEW TOO.

32
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:16,833
WELL, THAT'S THE

33
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,266
STUPIDEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN.

34
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:19,166
DO YOU LIKE ZOOM MEETINGS?

35
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:20,033
NO?

36
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,109
WELL, THIS IS LIKE THAT, EXCEPT

37
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:22,966
YOU GET TO WEAR A HELMET AND

38
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:24,366
YOUR COWORKERS ARE GLITCHY SIMS.

39
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:25,442
IT'S ANOTHER GAME-CHANGING HIT

40
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:28,666
FROM THE GUY WHO BROUGHT YOU

41
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:30,166
"EVERYONE YOU WENT TO

42
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:31,033
HIGH SCHOOL WITH IS Q-ANON NOW."

43
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,142
BUT INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THAT,

44
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:33,209
LET'S DIVE STRAIGHT IN WITH OUR

45
00:01:33,233 --> 00:01:34,933
AFGHANISTAN.

46
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,566
AMERICA'S WAR THERE IS DRAWING

47
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:37,333
TO A CLOSE AFTER ALMOST 20 YEARS

48
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,600
OF FIGHTING.

49
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:39,900
WE ALL KNEW THE END WAS LIKELY

50
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,833
TO BE UGLY.

51
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,200
THE ONLY QUESTION WAS

52
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:43,933
"HOW UGLY?"

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,009
WELL, THIS WEEK, WE GOT OUR

54
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:46,066
ANSWER.

55
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:47,300
AFGHANS ARE THRONGING TO

56
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:48,433
KABUL'S AIRPORT.

57
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,800
THIS IS WHAT DESPERATION

58
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:50,800
LOOKS LIKE.

59
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:52,142
WE NOW KNOW THAT AT LEAST ONE

60
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,309
OF THE AMERICAN TRANSPORTS TOOK

61
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,166
OFF WITH A PAYLOAD FAR IN EXCESS

62
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:58,200
OF THE MAXIMUM RECOMMENDED.

63
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:01,466
800 PEOPLE ON YOUR JET?

64
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:02,566
HOLY COW.

65
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:03,676
I MEAN, GOOD JOB GETTING OFF THE

66
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,700
GROUND.

67
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:06,500
HOLY SHIT.

68
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:07,866
THAT IS TERRIFYING.

69
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:09,300
YOU NEVER, EVER WANT TO BE ON A

70
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:10,500
PLANE THAT IS MANAGING TO

71
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:11,966
ACTIVELY IMPRESS AIR TRAFFIC

72
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:13,500
CONTROL.

73
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,066
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, THAT IS THE

74
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:15,833
EXACT REACTION I WANT EVERY TIME

75
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,766
I DO A SINGLE PUSH-UP.

76
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:17,700
"HOLY COW.

77
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:19,009
I MEAN, GOOD JOB GETTING OFF THE

78
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:19,333
GROUND.

79
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,566
NO ONE COULD'VE EXPECTED

80
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:22,533
ANYTHING MORE FROM YOU."

81
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,066
AND THE THING IS, THAT IS JUST

82
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:25,000
THE PEOPLE THAT MANAGED TO GET

83
00:02:25,066 --> 00:02:26,266
ONTO THE PLANE.

84
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,933
THERE WERE HORRIFIC VIDEOS THAT

85
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,240
WE ARE NOT GOING TO SHOW YOU OF

86
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:30,509
PEOPLE CLINGING TO THE WHEELS OF

87
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:32,833
A PLANE AND FALLING TO THEIR

88
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,833
DEATH AS THEY TOOK OFF.

89
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,500
AND WHILE BIDEN INSISTED THAT

90
00:02:35,566 --> 00:02:37,500
"WE PLANNED FOR EVERY

91
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:39,500
CONTINGENCY," THAT IS PRETTY

92
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:40,806
HARD TO BELIEVE GIVEN, JUST TEN

93
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:41,966
DAYS AGO, THE U.S. WAS

94
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:42,700
DESPERATELY TRYING TO NEGOTIATE

95
00:02:42,766 --> 00:02:43,966
WITH THE TALIBAN, ASKING IT TO

96
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:44,900
SPARE OUR EMBASSY IN KABUL.

97
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:46,266
A DAY LATER, THAT EMBASSY WAS

98
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,509
TOLD TO DESTROY SENSITIVE FILES,

99
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:48,833
AND BY THIS TIME LAST WEEK, WE

100
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,733
WERE EVACUATING IT ALTOGETHER.

101
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,500
ALTHOUGH THE SECRETARY OF STATE

102
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:54,846
PUSHED BACK ON THE IDEA THAT THE

103
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,940
EMBASSY WAS CLOSED AT ALL.

104
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:56,566
SO, IF NO AMERICAN IS IN THE

105
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:57,566
EMBASSY, WE'VE ESSENTIALLY

106
00:02:57,633 --> 00:02:58,733
CLOSED THE EMBASSY.

107
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,566
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU DON'T WANNA

108
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:00,366
SAY THAT.

109
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:00,866
YEAH.

110
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:01,976
NO, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A...

111
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,600
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A... WE'RE

112
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:03,200
GONNA HAVE OUR CORE DIPLOMATIC

113
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:03,533
PRESENCE.

114
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,333
WE WILL?

115
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,200
AND... AND, IN EFFECT, AN

116
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:05,866
EMBASSY AT A LOCATION AT THE

117
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:07,100
AIRPORT.

118
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,566
WOW, THAT IS A ROUGH

119
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:10,733
SENTENCE.

120
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,942
BECAUSE "WE'LL HAVE, IN EFFECT,

121
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:13,633
AN EMBASSY" IS ALREADY PRETTY

122
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,133
ALARMING, THEN YOU FINISH IT OFF

123
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,433
WITH "AT A LOCATION AT THE

124
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,033
AIRPORT," PERHAPS THE DARKEST

125
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,366
QUALIFIER IN THE ENGLISH

126
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,533
LANGUAGE.

127
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,433
BECAUSE, TO STATE THE OBVIOUS

128
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,233
HERE, AN EMBASSY DOES NOT BELONG

129
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,733
IN AN AIRPORT, BECAUSE IT'S NOT

130
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,233
A FUCKING WOLFGANG PUCK

131
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,000
RESTAURANT.

132
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:31,333
AND THE FACT IS, AMERICA HAS NOW

133
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,733
JOINED A LONG LINE OF COUNTRIES

134
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,700
WHO CAME TO AFGHANISTAN TO SERVE

135
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:35,466
THEIR OWN INTERESTS ONLY TO

136
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:36,933
LEAVE DEFEATED.

137
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
IT'S A PATTERN SO UNIVERSALLY

138
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,466
KNOWN IT WAS LITERALLY A PLOT

139
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:42,533
POINT IN "RAMBO III."

140
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,933
THIS IS AFGHANISTAN.

141
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,333
ALEXANDER THE GREAT TRIED TO

142
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,833
CONQUER THIS COUNTRY.

143
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,200
THEN GENGHIS KHAN, THEN THE

144
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:51,566
BRITISH, NOW RUSSIA.

145
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:53,166
ANCIENT ENEMY MAKE PRAYER ABOUT

146
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,033
THESE PEOPLE.

147
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,833
IT SAYS "MAY GOD DELIVER US FROM

148
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,833
THE VENOM OF THE COBRA, THE

149
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,466
TEETH OF THE TIGER, AND THE

150
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:04,533
VENGEANCE OF THE AFGHANS."

151
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,833
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS MEANS?

152
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,466
THAT YOU GUYS DON'T TAKE ANY

153
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:10,733
SHIT?

154
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,366
YES.

155
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:14,366
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

156
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:15,800
YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE

157
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:16,906
IT, ALTHOUGH IT FEELS LIKE

158
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:18,109
OL' RAMBO COULD HAVE USED A FEW

159
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,400
MORE FOLLOW-UPS THERE.

160
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:20,266
"YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS MEANS,

161
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:23,600
RIGHT?"

162
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:24,366
"YEAH, YOU GUYS DON'T TAKE ANY

163
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:25,866
SHIT."

164
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:26,800
"SURE, BUT ALSO THAT OUR

165
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:27,500
POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS LONG BEEN

166
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:28,466
DEFINED BY OTHER COUNTRIES'

167
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:30,000
IMPERIAL SELF-INTEREST.

168
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:30,800
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS?"

169
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:32,100
"NO.

170
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,633
NO, I DON'T."

171
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,466
"YEAH, I DIDN'T THINK SO.

172
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:36,300
YOU KNOW WHAT?

173
00:04:36,366 --> 00:04:37,166
I'M GUESSING WE'LL BE SEEING YOU

174
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:39,100
GUYS IN ROUGHLY 15 YEARS."

175
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,176
AND LOOK, CLEARLY, WE DON'T HAVE

176
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,833
TIME TO RECAP THE LAST 20 YEARS

177
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,300
OF AMERICA'S INVOLVEMENT IN

178
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:49,666
AFGHANISTAN, MUCH LESS RECKON

179
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:50,133
WITH ALL THE LONG-TERM

180
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,500
CONSEQUENCES.

181
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:51,366
BUT WE THOUGHT TONIGHT, IN THE

182
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:52,200
WAKE OF THE CHAOS THIS WEEK,

183
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:52,866
IT'D BE WORTH TRYING TO ANSWER A

184
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:53,533
WHY WERE WE

185
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,433
IN AFGHANISTAN IN THE FIRST

186
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,600
PLACE, WHAT DID WE DO WHILE WE

187
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,466
WERE THERE, AND WHAT ARE WE

188
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,033
DOING RIGHT NOW?

189
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,733
AND LET'S START WITH WHY WE WERE

190
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,400
THERE.

191
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:02,400
BECAUSE ON MONDAY, BIDEN OFFERED

192
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:03,533
THIS ORIGIN STORY:

193
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,700
WE WENT TO AFGHANISTAN ALMOST

194
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:08,233
20 YEARS AGO WITH CLEAR GOALS:

195
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,200
GET THOSE WHO ATTACKED US ON

196
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:13,900
SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, AND MAKE

197
00:05:13,966 --> 00:05:15,400
SURE AL-QAEDA COULD NOT USE

198
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:16,642
AFGHANISTAN AS A BASE FROM WHICH

199
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,100
TO ATTACK US AGAIN.

200
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,866
OUR MISSION IN AFGHANISTAN WAS

201
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:20,466
NEVER SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN

202
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:22,133
NATION-BUILDING.

203
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,300
OH, OKAY THEN.

204
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:24,600
IF OUR MISSION WAS NEVER

205
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,033
NATION-BUILDING, THEN I GUESS

206
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,433
NOT-MISSION NOT-ACCOMPLISHED.

207
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,733
BUT THE THING IS, THAT'S A

208
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,842
LITTLE TRUE BUT ALSO A LOT NOT.

209
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:33,909
BECAUSE, YES, THE PRIMARY REASON

210
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,500
FOR INITIALLY INVADING

211
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:37,500
AFGHANISTAN WAS 9/11 AND THE

212
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:38,642
FACT THAT THE TALIBAN HAD BEEN

213
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,333
GIVING SAFE HAVEN TO BIN LADEN.

214
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,200
BUT VERY QUICKLY, THAT MISSION

215
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:42,366
BECAME DRESSED UP IN THE

216
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:43,766
LANGUAGE OF NATION-BUILDING AND

217
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,800
HUMAN RIGHTS.

218
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:47,533
GEORGE W. BUSH SAID, "ROOTING

219
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,000
OUT THE TALIBAN WAS IMPORTANT,

220
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:50,733
BUT BUILDING A SCHOOL IS EQUALLY

221
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,233
IMPORTANT," AND BIDEN HIMSELF

222
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,766
SAID BACK THEN, "THE ALTERNATIVE

223
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,866
TO NATION-BUILDING IS CHAOS."

224
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:58,466
AND THERE WAS LOTS OF FOCUS AT

225
00:05:58,533 --> 00:05:59,733
THE TIME ON ATROCITIES THE

226
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,920
TALIBAN HAD COMMITTED DURING

227
00:06:00,966 --> 00:06:01,900
THEIR FIVE YEARS OF REPRESSIVE

228
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:03,400
RULE... THE SUBJUGATION OF

229
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:04,476
WOMEN, THE EXECUTIONS IN A

230
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,642
SOCCER STADIUM, THE DESTRUCTION

231
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,866
OF THE FAMOUS BUDDHAS OF

232
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,466
BAMIYAN, ALL OF WHICH WERE

233
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:10,100
TERRIBLE, BUT WHICH HAD BEEN

234
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,966
EQUALLY TERRIBLE BEFORE

235
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:13,733
SEPTEMBER 11TH, AND WE HADN'T

236
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,933
DONE MUCH ABOUT IT.

237
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,300
THE TRUTH IS, BETWEEN A

238
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:20,566
POST-9/11 DESIRE FOR VENGEANCE

239
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:22,533
AND THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION

240
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,900
FRAMING INTERVENTION AS A

241
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,700
"CRUSADE" FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, THEY

242
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:27,366
BUILT A NEAR-UNIVERSAL POLITICAL

243
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:28,866
CONSENSUS.

244
00:06:28,933 --> 00:06:30,733
ONLY ONE MEMBER OF CONGRESS,

245
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,400
REPRESENTATIVE BARBARA LEE,

246
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:33,676
VOTED AGAINST THE AUTHORIZATION

247
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,166
OF MILITARY FORCE.

248
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:37,500
OTHER DEMOCRATS JUMPED TO

249
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:39,066
CO-SIGN THE HUMAN RIGHTS

250
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:40,466
ARGUMENT, LIKE REPRESENTATIVE

251
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,466
CAROLYN MALONEY, WHO DELIVERED A

252
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:43,066
SPEECH ON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE

253
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:44,566
ABOUT THE NEED TO COMBAT TALIBAN

254
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:45,333
REPRESSIONS, FEATURING A

255
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,233
STRIKING VISUAL AID.

256
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,733
I SALUTE THE BUSH

257
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,233
ADMINISTRATION FOR BALANCING WAR

258
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,866
WITH COMPASSION.

259
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:53,466
FOR DROPPING FOOD AS WELL AS

260
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:55,300
BOMBS.

261
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:57,233
EVEN IN WAR, WE ARE SHOWING A

262
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,733
REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE AND

263
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,433
HUMAN RIGHTS THAT THE TALIBAN

264
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,400
WILL NEVER KNOW.

265
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,233
OKAY, FIRST, IT DOESN'T

266
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,833
GET MUCH MORE "THE MONTH AFTER

267
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,633
9/11" THAN A WHITE DEMOCRAT IN A

268
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,200
"FUCK YOU" BURQA SALUTING THE

269
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,509
BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT

270
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:17,800
TO HUMAN RIGHTS.

271
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:19,600
AND THE PROBLEM THERE IS, YOU

272
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:22,633
COULD BE REVEALING THE SOLUTION

273
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,666
FOR WORLD HUNGER, BUT IF YOU'RE

274
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:26,166
A WHITE LADY WHO THREW ON A

275
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:27,900
BURQA FOR THE DRAMA, YOU'RE

276
00:07:27,966 --> 00:07:28,500
FUNDAMENTALLY DISTRACTING FROM

277
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:28,966
YOUR POINT.

278
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:30,176
AS FOR "WE DROPPED FOOD AS WELL

279
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,733
AS BOMBS," THOSE TWO DO NOT

280
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,533
CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT.

281
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,680
AND WE DROPPED A LOT OF THE

282
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,800
SECOND.

283
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:37,766
OVER 71,000 AFGHAN AND PAKISTANI

284
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,400
CIVILIANS ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE

285
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:41,100
DIED AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE

286
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,366
WAR, WITH MANY MORE INJURED OR

287
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,133
DISPLACED.

288
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,666
AS FOR OUR PROGRAM OF DRONE

289
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:47,400
STRIKES, THEY DIDN'T JUST KILL

290
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:48,642
CIVILIANS... THEY TRAUMATIZED AN

291
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,833
ENTIRE GENERATION.

292
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,966
THE VILLAGERS CALL THEM

293
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:53,366
PLANES WITHOUT MEN.

294
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:57,566
SHEZ AMAN SAYS HIS

295
00:07:57,633 --> 00:07:58,500
NINE-YEAR-OLD SON, SULEIMAN, WAS

296
00:07:58,566 --> 00:07:59,609
KILLED BY A DRONE THREE MONTHS

297
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:00,266
AGO, ALONG WITH THE FATHERS OF

298
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,600
ALL OF THESE CHILDREN.

299
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,800
I'M SCARED THEY'LL BOMB US.

300
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:06,909
THEY KILLED MY FATHER AND I'M

301
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:08,466
AFRAID THEY'LL BOMB US TOO.

302
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:09,576
I CAN'T WALK OUTSIDE MY HOME

303
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,666
BECAUSE I'M SCARED.

304
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:12,566
I'M EVEN SCARED AT HOME.

305
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:15,533
YEAH, IT'S TERRIBLE.

306
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,742
SO IF CAROLYN MALONEY WANTS TO

307
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:18,066
ILLUSTRATE "ALL" THE MAJOR

308
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:19,633
THREATS AFGHAN SOCIETY'S FACED

309
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,776
IN RECENT YEARS, SHE MAY WANT TO

310
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,566
DELIVER HER NEXT SPEECH DRESSED

311
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:24,733
LIKE A FUCKING DRONE.

312
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,333
AND THOSE STRIKES ARE JUST ONE

313
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,300
PART OF THE ANSWER TO OUR SECOND

314
00:08:27,366 --> 00:08:28,366
QUESTION, WHICH IS,

315
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,800
"WHAT EXACTLY DID WE DO IN

316
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:31,066
AFGHANISTAN?"

317
00:08:31,133 --> 00:08:32,466
BECAUSE THE U.S. CAME IN WITH

318
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:34,133
BIG PLANS, PROMISING TO SET UP A

319
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,233
MODERN, CENTRALIZED DEMOCRACY.

320
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:38,800
AND YET, INSTEAD OF ENGAGING

321
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:39,666
WITH AND UNDERSTANDING THE

322
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:40,800
COUNTRY'S COMPLEX LOCAL

323
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:42,466
POLITICAL POWERS, WE ADOPTED A

324
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:43,966
POLICY OF PAYING OFF AND

325
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:45,633
CO-OPTING LOCAL WARLORDS AND

326
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,966
DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WHICH ERODED

327
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:49,633
TRUST QUICKLY BETWEEN THE AFGHAN

328
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,933
PEOPLE AND THE BLATANTLY CORRUPT

329
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,700
GOVERNMENT THAT WE HELPED FUEL.

330
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:56,233
BY 2006, IN THE WORDS OF ONE

331
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,033
RETIRED COLONEL, THE GOVERNMENT

332
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,633
HAD "SELF-ORGANIZED INTO A

333
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,876
KLEPTOCRACY" UNDER WHICH PEOPLE

334
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,300
IN POWER COULD PLUNDER THE

335
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:04,000
ECONOMY WITHOUT RESTRAINT.

336
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:09,466
AND YET, SUCCESSIVE

337
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:11,300
ADMINISTRATIONS KEPT GIVING US

338
00:09:11,366 --> 00:09:12,409
ROSY ASSESSMENTS LIKE THIS:

339
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:13,000
THE TALIBAN HAVE BEEN DRIVEN

340
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:13,900
FROM POWER, AL-QAEDA HAS BEEN

341
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:14,433
DRIVEN FROM ITS CAMPS, AND

342
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,666
AFGHANISTAN IS FREE.

343
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:18,066
THAT'S WHY I SAY WE HAVE MADE

344
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:20,500
REMARKABLE PROGRESS.

345
00:09:20,566 --> 00:09:22,133
THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN IS

346
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,233
ENDING.

347
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,966
AL-QAEDA HAS BEEN DECIMATED.

348
00:09:25,033 --> 00:09:27,400
OSAMA BIN LADEN IS DEAD.

349
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,066
WE HAVE MADE REAL PROGRESS.

350
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:30,833
WE MAKE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN

351
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,666
AFGHANISTAN.

352
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,633
AND WITH TIME, WE'LL HAVE IT

353
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,066
SPINNING LIKE A TOP.

354
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:38,600
OH.

355
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:39,300
OH, YOU WILL, WILL YOU?

356
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:43,333
BUT I GUESS HE'S TECHNICALLY

357
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:43,633
RIGHT THERE.

358
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,133
WE DID LEAVE AFGHANISTAN

359
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,766
"SPINNING LIKE A TOP," YOU KNOW,

360
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:45,600
THOSE THINGS THAT FAMOUSLY SPIN

361
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,742
FOREVER AND NEVER COLLAPSE.

362
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:48,000
THE FACT IS, THINGS OBVIOUSLY

363
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:52,166
WEREN'T GOING AS WELL AS ALL

364
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:55,000
THREE OF THOSE MEN PUBLICLY

365
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:56,700
CLAIMED, AS WE NOW KNOW... NOT

366
00:09:56,766 --> 00:09:58,266
LEAST THANKS TO THIS REVELATION

367
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:58,600
TWO YEARS AGO.

368
00:09:58,666 --> 00:09:59,600
ACCORDING TO MORE THAN 2,000

369
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,233
PAGES OF DOCUMENTS OBTAINED BY

370
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:00,966
"THE WASHINGTON POST," MILITARY

371
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:01,900
COMMANDERS, DIPLOMATS, AND AID

372
00:10:01,966 --> 00:10:04,266
WORKERS PRIVATELY AND IN BLUNT

373
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,966
TERMS DESCRIBE AN UNCLEAR

374
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:08,166
MISSION, A FAILED STRATEGY AND

375
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,966
EFFORTS TO SWAY PUBLIC OPINION.

376
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:12,266
AMONG THE REVELATIONS, RETIRED

377
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,800
GENERAL DOUGLAS LUTE, THE AFGHAN

378
00:10:13,866 --> 00:10:15,066
WAR CZAR UNDER PRESIDENTS BUSH

379
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:17,266
AND OBAMA, SAYING IN 2015,

380
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,600
"WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO HERE?

381
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:20,833
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE FOGGIEST

382
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,400
NOTION OF WHAT WE WERE

383
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:22,900
UNDERTAKING."

384
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:23,833
WOW.

385
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,133
THAT SOUNDS LESS LIKE SOMETHING

386
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,700
YOU'D EXPECT TO HEAR FROM A

387
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:30,466
GENERAL AND MORE LIKE THE

388
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:30,866
INTERNAL MONOLOGUE

389
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:31,666
FOR SIR IAN McKELLEN IN THIS

390
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:32,366
PHOTO FROM THE SET OF "CATS."

391
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:33,166
"WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO HERE?

392
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,433
HAS ANYONE GOT A PLAN FOR WHAT

393
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:35,000
THIS IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN

394
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:36,133
THE END?

395
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,866
I HAVEN'T THE FOGGIEST NOTION OF

396
00:10:37,933 --> 00:10:40,666
WHAT WE'RE UNDERTAKING."

397
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:42,100
THOSE INTERVIEWS WERE COLLECTED

398
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,500
BY SIGAR... THE SPECIAL

399
00:10:43,566 --> 00:10:44,866
INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR

400
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:46,566
AFGHANISTAN RECONSTRUCTION, A

401
00:10:46,633 --> 00:10:48,233
GOVERNMENT OFFICE TASKED WITH

402
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,442
PRODUCING HONEST REPORTS ABOUT

403
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:52,300
HOW THINGS WERE REALLY GOING

404
00:10:52,366 --> 00:10:53,233
THERE, ONE OF WHICH NOTED "THE

405
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,766
U.S. GOVERNMENT'S GOALS WERE

406
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,766
OFTEN OPERATIONALLY IMPRACTICAL

407
00:10:56,833 --> 00:11:00,933
OR CONCEPTUALLY INCOHERENT."

408
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,042
SIGAR'S MANDATE WAS TO PROMOTE

409
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:03,176
EFFICIENCY AND PREVENT WASTE,

410
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,000
FRAUD, AND ABUSE.

411
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:05,276
AND I KNOW FOCUSING ON WASTEFUL

412
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,266
SPENDING MAY SEEM LIKE THE

413
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,533
ABSOLUTE LEAST OF THE ISSUES

414
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,266
HERE, BUT SOMETIMES KNOWING

415
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,533
EXACTLY WHERE THE MONEY WAS

416
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,866
SPENT HELPS YOU UNDERSTAND THE

417
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:16,700
SCALE OF THE MESS WE'VE LEFT

418
00:11:16,766 --> 00:11:18,100
BEHIND.

419
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,100
BECAUSE SO MUCH MONEY WENT TO

420
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,366
MILITARY CONTRACTORS TO SET UP

421
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,666
PROJECTS WITH NO PLAN FOR HOW

422
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:24,566
THEY'D SURVIVE AFTER WE WERE

423
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:25,866
GONE.

424
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:27,066
HERE'S THE HEAD OF SIGAR

425
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:27,666
IDENTIFYING ONE EXPENDITURE IN

426
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:30,000
PARTICULAR.

427
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:32,366
I THINK THE WORST CASE SO FAR

428
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:36,433
OF JUST STUPID WASTE HAS BEEN

429
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,542
THE PURCHASE OF THE HELICOPTERS

430
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:38,466
AND AIRPLANES FOR THE AFGHAN AIR

431
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:39,433
WING.

432
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,000
IT'S CLEARLY RISKING THAT THOSE

433
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:41,833
PLANES AND THOSE HELICOPTERS ARE

434
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,266
JUST GONNA END UP ON THE TARMAC

435
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,166
RUSTING.

436
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:46,300
THEY CAN'T EVEN USE THE

437
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:48,000
PLANES THEY CURRENTLY HAVE.

438
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:49,500
OVER 70% OF THE MAINTENANCE IS

439
00:11:49,566 --> 00:11:52,066
BEING DONE BY U.S. CONTRACTORS,

440
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:53,733
NOT BY THE AFGHANS.

441
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,833
THEY DON'T HAVE THE PILOTS,

442
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,666
THEY DON'T HAVE THE GROUND

443
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:57,666
CREWS, THEY DON'T HAVE THE

444
00:11:57,733 --> 00:11:58,533
WORKERS TO...

445
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,466
SO WHY ARE WE BUYING THEM?

446
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:03,266
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

447
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,600
YEAH, IT IS.

448
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:06,333
THAT CLIP IS FROM SEVEN YEARS

449
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:06,966
AGO, BUT IT'S NOT LIKE, SINCE

450
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:08,433
THEN, WE'VE FIXED THE UNDERLYING

451
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:08,666
PROBLEM.

452
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:09,266
LAST MONTH, DEFENSE OFFICIALS

453
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,166
WERE MAINTAINING THAT AIRCRAFT

454
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:11,066
COULD STILL BE USED AFTER WE

455
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:12,933
WERE GONE BECAUSE AFGHANS COULD

456
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,266
SIMPLY SERVICE THEM WITH

457
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,509
"U.S. CONTRACTORS LOOKING OVER

458
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:17,766
THEIR SHOULDERS VIA ZOOM OR

459
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,033
COACHING THEM OVER THE PHONE."

460
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,176
WHICH IS SO CLOSE TO NOTHING

461
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,800
THAT I'M HONESTLY SURPRISED THE

462
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:24,866
U.S. DIDN'T JUST BUY EVERY

463
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:25,866
AFGHAN TECHNICIAN A MASTERCLASS

464
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:27,109
SUBSCRIPTION AND TELL THEM THAT

465
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:28,466
ANNA WINTOUR'S COURSE WOULD

466
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:31,033
SUPERCHARGE THEIR CREATIVITY.

467
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,433
AND THAT'S EMBLEMATIC OF OUR

468
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,866
WE CAME

469
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:36,800
IN, BUILT SOMETHING ON THE

470
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:37,666
AMERICAN MODEL, ALMOST WHOLLY

471
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:38,776
DEPENDENT ON AMERICAN SUPPORT,

472
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,000
AND PUT NEXT TO NO EFFORT INTO

473
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:41,346
ENSURING THAT IT WAS SUSTAINABLE

474
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,566
AFTER WE LEFT.

475
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:45,300
TAKE THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF.

476
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:46,666
FOREIGN GRANTS FINANCED AROUND

477
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:49,300
75% OF ITS PUBLIC SPENDING,

478
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:50,966
MEANING THAT, AS THE TALIBAN

479
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:52,566
TAKES OVER, THAT MONEY

480
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:54,533
PRESUMABLY DRIES UP, AND THE

481
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,100
ECONOMY IS NOW POISED TO

482
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,900
COLLAPSE.

483
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:00,200
AND IT'S NOT JUST THE ECONOMY

484
00:13:00,266 --> 00:13:01,166
THAT'S IN DANGER HERE.

485
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:02,633
THERE WERE REAL, MEANINGFUL

486
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,200
GAINS... PARTICULARLY FOR WOMEN,

487
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:05,433
WHO'D SUFFERED TERRIBLY UNDER

488
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,609
THE PREVIOUS TALIBAN REGIME.

489
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:07,566
MILLIONS OF GIRLS WERE ALLOWED

490
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:08,742
TO ATTEND SCHOOL FOR THE FIRST

491
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:09,666
TIME, AND WOMEN JOINED THE

492
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:10,966
MILITARY, THE POLICE, AND HELD

493
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:12,400
POLITICAL OFFICE.

494
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:13,509
BUT THOSE ACHIEVEMENTS ARE IN

495
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:15,200
REAL JEOPARDY NOW.

496
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:16,509
AND SOME WHO LED THE WAY... LIKE

497
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:17,900
MAHBOUBA SERAJ, AN AFGHAN

498
00:13:17,966 --> 00:13:19,206
WOMEN'S ACTIVIST... ARE ACUTELY

499
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:22,100
AWARE OF THAT.

500
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,000
I'M GOING TO SAY TO THE WHOLE

501
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:24,366
WORLD, SHAME ON YOU.

502
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:25,466
ARE YOU USING ALL OF US?

503
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:26,866
ARE WE BEING JUST PAWNS IN YOUR

504
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:27,466
HANDS?

505
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:29,333
IS THAT WHAT IT IS?

506
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,633
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

507
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,333
THEY JUST MADE DECISIONS WITH

508
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,766
THEIR GUT FEELINGS OR WHATEVER,

509
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,500
ALL OF THESE MEN OF THE WORLD

510
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:37,609
THAT THEY WERE IN POWER, AND

511
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:39,433
THEY'RE DESTROYING SOMETHING

512
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,200
THAT WE WORKED SO HARD FOR.

513
00:13:42,266 --> 00:13:44,166
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN AFGHANISTAN

514
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:45,400
TODAY IS GOING TO PUT THIS

515
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:48,900
COUNTRY 200 YEARS BACK.

516
00:13:48,966 --> 00:13:49,800
THAT IS INCREDIBLY HARD

517
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:55,166
TO HEAR.

518
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:56,800
AND THE THING IS, SHE'S RIGHT.

519
00:13:56,866 --> 00:13:57,666
THE PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN "HAVE"

520
00:13:57,733 --> 00:13:58,200
BEEN TREATED LIKE PAWNS.

521
00:13:58,266 --> 00:13:58,866
WHILE THERE WERE GAINS, THE

522
00:13:58,933 --> 00:13:59,800
INITIAL IMPULSE THAT LED TO THEM

523
00:13:59,866 --> 00:14:00,466
WAS PURELY U.S. INTERESTS.

524
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:01,166
AND FOR 20 YEARS, FOR MULTIPLE

525
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:02,133
REASONS, THE U.S. AND VARIOUS

526
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,733
AFGHAN GOVERNMENTS DIDN'T SECURE

527
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,566
THOSE GAINS.

528
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:05,533
AND EVEN THOUGH THIS WEEK HAS

529
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,900
BROUGHT INCREDIBLE SCENES OF

530
00:14:06,966 --> 00:14:08,400
AFGHAN WOMEN LEADING PROTESTS

531
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:09,966
AGAINST THE INCOMING TALIBAN

532
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:11,566
REGIME, ODDS ARE, MUCH OF THAT

533
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:13,766
PROGRESS IS NOW SET TO BE

534
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:20,366
OBLITERATED.

535
00:14:20,433 --> 00:14:21,033
BUT HERE IS WHERE IT GETS REALLY

536
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,400
HARD.

537
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:22,066
WHAT WAS THE ANSWER HERE?

538
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:24,100
TO STAY INDEFINITELY?

539
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:24,733
IT IS VERY HARD TO MAKE A GOOD

540
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,500
CASE FOR THAT, ESPECIALLY GIVEN

541
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:26,666
THE TALIBAN HAD BEEN

542
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:27,633
STRENGTHENING IN RECENT YEARS

543
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,000
AND HAD MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY

544
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:30,306
WERE GOING TO ESCALATE VIOLENCE

545
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,100
UNLESS WE LEFT.

546
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,100
WHICH MOST PEOPLE AGREE, WE HAD

547
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:38,433
TO DO.

548
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,066
THE PROBLEM IS THOUGH, JUST AS

549
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:42,366
WE WENT IN FOCUSED ENTIRELY ON

550
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:43,666
U.S. INTERESTS, WE'RE LEAVING

551
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:44,100
THE EXACT SAME WAY.

552
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:44,800
AND THAT BRINGS US TO WHAT WE'RE

553
00:14:44,866 --> 00:14:45,733
DOING RIGHT NOW.

554
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,966
BECAUSE THIS EXIT WAS SET IN

555
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:48,433
MOTION IN FEBRUARY OF 2020, WHEN

556
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,709
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION STRUCK

557
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:51,066
A DEAL WITH THE TALIBAN FOR A

558
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:52,500
TOTAL U.S. WITHDRAWAL BY MAY OF

559
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:54,000
THIS YEAR.

560
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:55,242
IN EXCHANGE, THE TALIBAN AGREED

561
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:56,933
NOT TO LET AFGHANISTAN BECOME A

562
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,866
HAVEN FOR TERRORISTS, AND TO

563
00:14:58,933 --> 00:14:59,833
START PEACE TALKS WITH THE

564
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,000
AFGHAN GOVERNMENT.

565
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,600
ALTHOUGH, NOTABLY, THAT DEAL

566
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,233
EXCLUDED THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT,

567
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,066
MAKING THIS LINE FROM

568
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:06,266
MIKE POMPEO A LITTLE

569
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,733
HARD TO TAKE.

570
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,200
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT, THE

571
00:15:09,266 --> 00:15:10,309
FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN IS FOR

572
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:13,466
AFGHANS TO DETERMINE.

573
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:14,576
THE U.S.-TALIBAN DEAL CREATES

574
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,676
THE CONDITIONS FOR AFGHANS TO DO

575
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,733
JUST THAT.

576
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,833
WELL, HOLD ON.

577
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,000
YOU NEVER WANT TWO PEOPLE IN A

578
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:23,000
ROOM DETERMINING YOUR FUTURE

579
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:24,466
WITHOUT YOU, ESPECIALLY IF ONE

580
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:27,533
OF THEM IS THE TALIBAN.

581
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,033
HOW DOES POMPEO EXPECT THEM TO

582
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,300
REACT TO THAT?

583
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,133
CONGRATULATIONS, AFGHANS.

584
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,000
TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF WHAT

585
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:36,209
SOMEONE ELSE DETERMINED THE REST

586
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:37,433
OF YOUR LIFE WILL BE.

587
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,633
NOW, BIDEN PUSHED OUR EXIT DATE

588
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,233
BACK SLIGHTLY, TO AUGUST 31, BUT

589
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,066
HE BASICALLY FOLLOWED THROUGH

590
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:43,633
WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S

591
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,266
DEAL.

592
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,409
AND WHILE THE TALIBAN LARGELY

593
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:47,166
STUCK BY THEIR PROMISE NOT TO

594
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:48,633
ATTACK U.S. PERSONNEL, ALMOST

595
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,200
IMMEDIATELY AFTER SIGNING THAT

596
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:51,766
DEAL, THEY CARRIED OUT AT LEAST

597
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:55,166
76 ATTACKS ACROSS 24 AFGHAN

598
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:56,966
PROVINCES AND HAVE SINCE PURSUED

599
00:15:57,033 --> 00:15:57,966
ASSASSINATION CAMPAIGNS OF

600
00:15:58,033 --> 00:15:59,100
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS,

601
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,209
JOURNALISTS, AND CIVIL SOCIETY

602
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:01,700
ACTORS, AND JUST THIS MAY,

603
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:02,966
BEHEADED AN AFGHAN INTERPRETER

604
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,633
FOR THE U.S. ARMY.

605
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,333
AND YET, ALL THE WHILE, THEY'VE

606
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,900
MADE A BIG SHOW OF PRESENTING

607
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:09,666
THEMSELVES IN A MORE MODERN,

608
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:10,809
FLATTERING LIGHT... SOMETHING

609
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,266
THAT CONTINUED THIS WEEK.

610
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:17,933
THIS WAS A SMARTER, MORE

611
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,300
MEDIA-SAVVY TALIBAN ONE.

612
00:16:19,366 --> 00:16:20,600
SENIOR LEADERS CLAIMING THEY

613
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:21,566
WANT TO FORM AN "INCLUSIVE,

614
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:22,333
ISLAMIC GOVERNMENT."

615
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,266
THE GROUP IS ESTABLISHING A

616
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,033
"CIVILIAN CASUALTY PREVENTION

617
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,600
AND COMPLAINTS COMMISSION,"

618
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:30,333
TWEETING OUT WHATSAPP PHONE

619
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,000
NUMBERS FOR AFGHANS TO SEND IN

620
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:32,566
COMPLAINTS.

621
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:34,400
WOW, THAT IS SOMETHING.

622
00:16:34,466 --> 00:16:35,766
AND SET ASIDE THE FACT THAT

623
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,200
"TALIBAN COMPLAINTS DEPARTMENT"

624
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:38,866
SOUNDS LIKE A SKETCH ELON MUSK

625
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:40,233
PITCHED TO "SNL," I'M NOT SURE

626
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,266
IT'S GOING TO BE ALL THAT

627
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,200
EFFECTIVE.

628
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:43,466
IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF

629
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:44,766
INSTITUTING A COMPLAINT BOX IN

630
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,400
SCOTT RUDIN'S OFFICE.

631
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:48,509
THE PROBLEM WITH THE BEHAVIOR

632
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:50,933
THERE ISN'T "LACK OF AWARENESS."

633
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,100
A SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED TALIBAN

634
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,066
JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKELY HERE.

635
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:55,833
THEIR TIES TO AL-QAEDA ONLY

636
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,000
APPEAR TO BE DEEPENING.

637
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:57,933
AND THEY'RE NOW EVEN BETTER

638
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
ARMED.

639
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:00,366
THE AFGHAN FORCES FELL SO

640
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:01,666
QUICKLY, THEY LEFT BEHIND

641
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:06,033
BRAND-NEW BOXES OF GUNS AND

642
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:06,700
GRENADE LAUNCHERS, WHICH TALIBAN

643
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:07,366
FIGHTERS HAVE BEEN FILMING

644
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:08,300
THEMSELVES OPENING IN THE

645
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:09,133
WORLD'S GRIMMEST UNBOXING

646
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,966
VIDEOS.

647
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:11,113
INCIDENTS WHICH LED TO THIS

648
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,566
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BILLIONS

649
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:17,033
OF DOLLARS WORTH OF WEAPONRY

650
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,933
THAT THE U.S. GAVE AFGHANISTAN?

651
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,900
WE DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE

652
00:17:19,966 --> 00:17:20,700
PICTURE, OBVIOUSLY, OF WHERE

653
00:17:20,766 --> 00:17:22,266
EVERY ARTICLE OF DEFENSE

654
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,200
MATERIALS HAS GONE.

655
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:25,276
BUT CERTAINLY A FAIR AMOUNT OF

656
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,533
IT HAS FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF

657
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,000
THE TALIBAN, AND, AH, OBVIOUSLY

658
00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:37,533
WE DON'T HAVE A SENSE THAT

659
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,833
THEY ARE GOING TO READILY HAND

660
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,566
IT OVER TO US AT THE AIRPORT.

661
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:43,233
AH, YEAH, I THINK

662
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:43,766
THAT'S A SAFE ASSUMPTION.

663
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:44,533
BUT HEY, WE COULD ALWAYS TEXT

664
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,200
THE TALIBAN COMPLAINT DEPARTMENT

665
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:45,866
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

666
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:46,800
I'M SURE WE'LL BE DEALT WITH

667
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:47,433
SWIFTLY.

668
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,433
SO HERE WE ARE, 20 YEARS OF WAR

669
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,133
AND DESTRUCTION.

670
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,100
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AFGHANS

671
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:50,666
KILLED.

672
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:52,200
MANY MORE TRAUMATIZED.

673
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:53,733
AND THE OVERALL SENSE YOU HAVE

674
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,966
AT THIS POINT IS OF DEEP

675
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,066
BETRAYAL OF THE

676
00:17:57,133 --> 00:17:58,866
PROMISES THAT WERE MADE TO THE

677
00:17:58,933 --> 00:18:00,633
AFGHAN PEOPLE AND BETRAYAL OF

678
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,900
THE U.S. SERVICE MEMBERS ASKED

679
00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:03,633
TO EXECUTE THOSE SELF-SERVING

680
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,742
PROMISES AND WHO ARE NOW LEFT

681
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:05,633
ASKING THEMSELVES, "WHAT DID I

682
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,966
JUST DO?

683
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:08,200
WHAT WAS THIS ALL FOR?"

684
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:09,866
THE MILITARY SENT OUT AN EMAIL

685
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:11,800
TO 9 MILLION VETERANS THIS WEEK

686
00:18:11,866 --> 00:18:13,700
OFFERING A LIST OF MENTAL HEALTH

687
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:15,300
RESOURCES WITH NOTES LIKE,

688
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:17,433
"IF YOU'RE HAVING THOUGHTS OF

689
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,300
SUICIDE, CALL THIS NUMBER."

690
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:20,933
AND IF YOU ARE, DO.

691
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,433
THIS IS A GRIM SITUATION.

692
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
AND THERE ARE IMMEDIATE

693
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:25,066
DECISIONS THAT NEED TO BE MADE

694
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:26,200
THAT HAVE LIFE-OR-DEATH

695
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:27,900
CONSEQUENCES FOR AFGHANS WHO PUT

696
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:29,466
THEIR TRUST IN US, LIKE THIS

697
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,533
FATIMA, THAT'S NOT HER REAL

698
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,100
NAME, AND HER CHILDREN HAVE GONE

699
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,566
INTO HIDING AFTER DEATH THREATS

700
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:36,842
FROM THE TALIBAN FOR HER WORK IN

701
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,333
EMPOWERING OTHER WOMEN.

702
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,700
SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS BUILDING A

703
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:43,133
NEW AND BETTER AFGHANISTAN, BUT

704
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,700
NOW SHE'S VIEWED AS A SPY AND

705
00:18:44,766 --> 00:18:48,666
ENEMY COLLABORATOR.

706
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:51,900
I FEEL EXTREMELY ABANDONED.

707
00:18:51,966 --> 00:18:52,666
I AM IN... I AM IN DANGER.

708
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:53,933
IT'S NOT ONLY THAT I AM IN

709
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,766
DANGER, NOW MY KIDS ARE IN

710
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:55,833
DANGER.

711
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,833
THEY WON'T... THEY WON'T LEAVE

712
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,933
US... THEY WON'T LEAVE ME ALIVE.

713
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,900
WE BEAR RESPONSIBILITY

714
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:03,500
FOR THE POSITION SHE'S IN.

715
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:04,676
WE SAID WE'D PROTECT PEOPLE WHO

716
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,533
DID COURAGEOUS THINGS THAT

717
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,100
PISSED OFF THE TALIBAN, LIKE

718
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:08,766
"ADVOCATE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS,"

719
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:09,700
EVEN IF IT WOUND UP PUTTING A

720
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:10,866
TARGET ON THEIR BACK.

721
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:11,833
AND NOW IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE

722
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,700
WALKING AWAY GOING, "WHOA, COOL

723
00:19:12,766 --> 00:19:13,266
TARGET, HOW'D YOU GET THAT?

724
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:13,966
YOU KNOW WHAT?

725
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:16,800
DON'T ANSWER, WE'RE LEAVING."

726
00:19:16,866 --> 00:19:18,500
AND AGAIN, I AM NOT ADVOCATING

727
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:21,733
FOR STAYING.

728
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,533
AT ALL.

729
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,642
WHAT I'M SAYING IS, WE'RE IN THE

730
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:24,842
MIDST OF A MASSIVE HUMANITARIAN

731
00:19:24,866 --> 00:19:26,400
CRISIS, AND WE HAVE A CLEAR

732
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:27,800
OBLIGATION TO TAKE IN AFGHANS

733
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,033
WHO ARE NOW VULNERABLE... AND

734
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,433
NOT JUST THOSE THAT WORKED WITH

735
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,200
U.S. TROOPS, BUT THOSE, LIKE

736
00:19:32,266 --> 00:19:33,276
FATIMA AND HER CHILDREN, WHOSE

737
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,033
LIVES ARE NOW AT GRAVE RISK.

738
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,500
ALTHOUGH SOME CONSERVATIVE

739
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:38,200
COMMENTATORS ARE ALREADY TRYING

740
00:19:38,266 --> 00:19:40,766
TO GET WAY OUT AHEAD OF THAT.

741
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,042
IF HISTORY IS ANY GUIDE, AND

742
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:45,933
IT'S ALWAYS A GUIDE, WE WILL SEE

743
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,833
MANY REFUGEES FROM AFGHANISTAN

744
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,633
RESETTLE IN OUR COUNTRY IN

745
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,266
COMING MONTHS, PROBABLY IN YOUR

746
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,366
NEIGHBORHOOD.

747
00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:50,542
AND OVER THE NEXT DECADE, THAT

748
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:52,200
NUMBER MAY SWELL TO THE

749
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:53,100
MILLIONS.

750
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,342
SO FIRST WE INVADE, AND THEN WE

751
00:19:54,366 --> 00:19:55,466
ARE INVADED.

752
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:56,700
THE LESSON OF THIS 20-YEAR

753
00:19:56,766 --> 00:19:58,800
WAR CANNOT BE THAT EVERY TIME WE

754
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:00,500
TURN A COUNTRY UPSIDE DOWN OR

755
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,233
MAKE HUGE MISTAKES, OUR

756
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,266
IMMIGRATION LAWS, OUR REFUGEE

757
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:11,066
LAWS NO LONGER APPLY.

758
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:12,800
OKAY, FIRST, FUCK OFF,

759
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:13,633
YOU TAG TEAM RACIAL PANIC

760
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,166
GOBLINS.

761
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:15,633
SECOND, THE NOTION OF

762
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,133
"EVERY TIME WE TURN A COUNTRY

763
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,533
UPSIDE DOWN" IS AN INCREDIBLE

764
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,033
THING TO JUST BLOW PAST.

765
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,142
MAYBE THAT'S THE LESSON HERE,

766
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,233
LAURA.

767
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:22,966
MAYBE DON'T KEEP TURNING

768
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:24,700
COUNTRIES UPSIDE DOWN IN THE

769
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:25,966
FIRST PLACE.

770
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:26,866
AS FOR, "OUR REFUGEE LAWS NO

771
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:28,966
LONGER APPLY"?

772
00:20:29,033 --> 00:20:30,533
WE ARE A BIG PART OF WHY THOSE

773
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,700
PEOPLE ARE REFUGEES.

774
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:34,006
HELPING THEM NOW ISN'T CHARITY,

775
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,833
IT'S DOING THE BARE MINIMUM.

776
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,200
REFUSING TO HELP A NEIGHBOR

777
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:38,633
WHOSE HOME JUST BURNED DOWN IS

778
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,300
SHITTY.

779
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:42,442
DOING IT WHEN YOU HELPED START

780
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:43,866
THE FIRE IS FUCKING MONSTROUS.

781
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:45,766
AND THE THING IS, THEY'RE NOT

782
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:46,942
THE ONLY ONES WHO'VE BEEN BLITHE

783
00:20:46,966 --> 00:20:49,333
ABOUT THE FATE OF THE AFGHANS.

784
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,866
BIDEN'S FAILURE TO PLAN HERE IS

785
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:53,466
ASTONISHING.

786
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:54,709
BUT HIS CONTINUED INDIFFERENCE

787
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:57,233
TO THE LIVES OF ANYONE WHO'S NOT

788
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,433
AMERICAN ISN'T SURPRISING.

789
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,066
HE'S FELT THIS WAY FOR YEARS.

790
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:02,600
ACCORDING TO THE LATE DIPLOMAT

791
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:03,866
RICHARD HOLBROOKE'S DIARY, IN

792
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:06,400
2010, THE TWO MEN HAD A

793
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:07,866
CONVERSATION, AND BIDEN TOLD

794
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,433
HIM THE U.S. HAD TO WITHDRAW

795
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,933
EVERY TROOP FROM AFGHANISTAN,

796
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,366
REGARDLESS OF THE CONSEQUENCES

797
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:13,333
FOR WOMEN OR ANYONE ELSE.

798
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,933
AND WHEN HOLBROOKE ASKED HIM

799
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,666
ABOUT AMERICAN OBLIGATIONS TO

800
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:19,300
THOSE WHO'D BE IN DANGER IF WE

801
00:21:19,366 --> 00:21:20,442
LEFT, BIDEN MENTIONED THE U.S.

802
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:21,509
WITHDRAWAL FROM SOUTHEAST ASIA

803
00:21:21,533 --> 00:21:22,866
IN 1973, SAYING, "FUCK THAT, WE

804
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:24,433
DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

805
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,666
WE DID IT IN VIETNAM, NIXON AND

806
00:21:26,733 --> 00:21:28,000
KISSINGER GOT AWAY WITH IT."

807
00:21:28,066 --> 00:21:31,400
AND MAY I SAY, JOE?

808
00:21:31,466 --> 00:21:32,300
A-PLUS CHOICE OF HISTORICAL

809
00:21:32,366 --> 00:21:33,300
ROLE-MODELS THERE.

810
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:34,409
WHEN YOU'RE ROLLING WITH DICK

811
00:21:34,433 --> 00:21:35,100
AND THE KISS, YOU KNOW YOU'RE

812
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,300
ROLLING ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF

813
00:21:37,366 --> 00:21:41,500
HISTORY.

814
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:42,266
AND LAST FEBRUARY, BIDEN DOUBLED

815
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,633
DOWN ON THAT ARGUMENT.

816
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,600
DON'T YOU BEAR SOME

817
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:45,266
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OUTCOME

818
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,000
IF THE TALIBAN ENDS UP BACK IN

819
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:46,733
CONTROL AND WOMEN END UP LOSING

820
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,100
THE RIGHTS?

821
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:47,966
NO, I DON'T.

822
00:21:48,033 --> 00:21:48,633
DO I BEAR RESPONSIBILITY?

823
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,366
ZERO RESPONSIBILITY.

824
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:51,933
THE RESPONSIBILITY I HAVE IS TO

825
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,200
PROTECT AMERICA'S NATIONAL

826
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:55,966
SELF-INTEREST AND NOT PUT OUR

827
00:21:56,033 --> 00:21:58,300
WOMEN AND MEN IN HARM'S WAY TO

828
00:21:58,366 --> 00:22:00,033
TRY TO SOLVE EVERY SINGLE

829
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,666
PROBLEM IN THE WORLD BY USE OF

830
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:02,333
FORCE.

831
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,166
THAT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY AS

832
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:04,766
PRESIDENT.

833
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,609
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE A ZERO

834
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:07,566
WITH YOUR FINGERS TO INDICATE

835
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:09,133
YOU MEAN ZERO.

836
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,933
YOU'RE AN ADULT MAN, NOT

837
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,933
A CHILD ENSEMBLE MEMBER OF

838
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
BROADWAY'S "MATILDA."

839
00:22:16,066 --> 00:22:17,300
THOUGH I WILL SAY, IF BIDEN

840
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:21,333
WANTS TO ARGUE FOR ISOLATIONISM

841
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,166
GOING FORWARD, HE'S WELCOME TO

842
00:22:22,233 --> 00:22:22,733
DO THAT.

843
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,600
BUT WHAT HE CAN'T DO IS USE THAT

844
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:24,200
AS A JUSTIFICATION TO DISMISS

845
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:24,900
THE FATES OF PEOPLE IN WHOSE

846
00:22:24,966 --> 00:22:25,966
COUNTRY WE'VE ALREADY

847
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,433
DISASTROUSLY INTERVENED.

848
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,766
BECAUSE WE HAVE A NON-ZERO DUTY

849
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,633
AT THIS POINT TO DO EVERYTHING

850
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,100
WE CAN TO HELP THEM.

851
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,766
AND THAT MEANS GETTING AS MANY

852
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:36,200
PEOPLE OUT AS WE CAN.

853
00:22:36,266 --> 00:22:37,442
AND ADVOCATES FOR REFUGEES SAY

854
00:22:37,466 --> 00:22:39,233
THE FIRST THING TO DO IS SECURE

855
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,333
A PERIMETER AT THE KABUL

856
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,100
AIRPORT, MAKING SURE PEOPLE HAVE

857
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:43,866
A SAFE WAY TO GET THERE AND GET

858
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:49,500
INSIDE, BECAUSE THAT HAS BEEN

859
00:22:49,566 --> 00:22:50,933
TOTAL CHAOS THIS WEEK, TO THE

860
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,366
POINT THAT MANY OF THE DEPARTING

861
00:22:52,433 --> 00:22:52,933
FLIGHTS HAVE LEFT WITH EMPTY

862
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,400
SEATS.

863
00:22:53,466 --> 00:22:54,200
AND THE FACT THERE ARE PEOPLE

864
00:22:54,266 --> 00:22:55,409
WITH VISAS UNABLE TO GET ONTO

865
00:22:55,433 --> 00:22:57,766
THE PLANES IS BAD ENOUGH.

866
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,009
BUT THERE ARE MANY MORE AT-RISK

867
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:03,200
AFGHANS WHO ARE STILL STUCK IN

868
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:05,700
THE VISA PROCESS, AND WE SHOULD

869
00:23:05,766 --> 00:23:10,366
BE GETTING THEM TO THE U.S. AS

870
00:23:10,433 --> 00:23:11,166
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO THEY

871
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:11,866
CAN THEN SAFELY FINISH THEIR

872
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:12,433
PAPERWORK... AND THAT CAN BE

873
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,033
ACHIEVED BY GRANTING THEM

874
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,700
CATEGORICAL "HUMANITARIAN

875
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:16,066
PAROLE."

876
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:17,209
AND TO THE EXTENT ANY HESITATION

877
00:23:17,233 --> 00:23:18,600
ABOUT DOING THIS IS DUE TO FEAR

878
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:19,533
OF POLITICAL BLOWBACK THANKS TO

879
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,066
IDIOTS LIKE THESE, CALL YOUR

880
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:25,133
REPRESENTATIVES AND TELL THEM

881
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,033
THAT YOU CARE ABOUT THIS.

882
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,500
BECAUSE IF THEY THINK THAT YOU

883
00:23:32,566 --> 00:23:33,166
DON'T, IT IS NOT GOING TO

884
00:23:33,233 --> 00:23:33,700
HAPPEN.

885
00:23:33,766 --> 00:23:34,333
THE CHAOS THIS WEEK IS

886
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,966
ALREADY A STAIN ON BIDEN'S

887
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:35,966
LEGACY... THE ONLY QUESTION IS,

888
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:36,633
HOW BIG DOES HE WANT THAT STAIN

889
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,733
TO BE?

890
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,842
AND THAT IS REALLY UP TO HIM.

891
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:41,033
BUT MORE BROADLY, WE, AS A

892
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,400
COUNTRY, NEED TO TAKE A HARD

893
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:43,566
LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE IN

894
00:23:43,633 --> 00:23:44,966
AFGHANISTAN... WHICH IS LIKELY

895
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:46,109
TO BE DESTABILIZED FOR DECADES

896
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,600
TO COME.

897
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,966
SO WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THAT?

898
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:53,333
NOT MUCH NOW.

899
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,766
NO AMOUNT OF BRUTE FORCE OR

900
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:55,700
PERSEVERANCE IS GOING TO CLEAR

901
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:58,800
UP THE CLUSTERFUCK THAT WE

902
00:23:58,866 --> 00:24:00,233
HELPED FUCK INTO EXISTENCE.

903
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:00,933
AND I REALIZE THAT'S A

904
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,833
QUINTESSENTIALLY UNAMERICAN

905
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,600
IDEA... TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE

906
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:04,066
CAN'T ALWAYS CONTROL SOMETHING

907
00:24:04,133 --> 00:24:05,933
WE WANT TO CONTROL OR ACHIEVE

908
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,160
SOMETHING WE WANT TO ACHIEVE.

909
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,866
BUT THE TRUTH IS, WE CAN'T.

910
00:24:08,933 --> 00:24:11,300
I KNOW THAT FEELS FUTILE.

911
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,366
BUT ASSUMING WE CAN GO INTO

912
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:14,500
ANOTHER COUNTRY AND FIX

913
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:19,433
EVERYTHING BY SIMPLY IMPOSING

914
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,266
OUR WILL IS LARGELY WHAT LED US

915
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:22,800
TO WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.

916
00:24:22,866 --> 00:24:23,400
WE HAVE SPENT DECADES CLAIMING

917
00:24:23,466 --> 00:24:24,000
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE THE

918
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:26,533
WORLD'S PROBLEMS... ALBEIT

919
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,966
ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY WHEN IT

920
00:24:29,033 --> 00:24:29,766
HELPED SOLVE OUR OWN... AND THE

921
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,009
RESULT HAS BEEN, IN THE WORDS OF

922
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:31,533
THIS PROFESSIONAL

923
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,333
PEARL-CLUTCHER, THAT WE'VE

924
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,542
TURNED ONE COUNTRY AFTER ANOTHER

925
00:24:33,566 --> 00:24:36,200
UPSIDE DOWN.

926
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,100
SO WE SHOULD MAYBE STOP DOING

927
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:39,466
THAT.

928
00:24:39,533 --> 00:24:41,233
BUT IN THE MEANTIME, THE LEAST

929
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,500
WE COULD DO IS HELP ALLEVIATE

930
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:44,233
THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AHEAD.

931
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,366
BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS

932
00:24:46,433 --> 00:24:47,866
IN AFGHANISTAN FROM HERE ON OUT,

933
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:49,000
THERE IS NO UNIVERSE WHERE

934
00:24:49,066 --> 00:24:50,466
AMERICA BEARS ZERO

935
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:51,700
RESPONSIBILITY.

936
00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:58,433
AND NOW THIS.

937
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,400
AND NOW, TAMRON

938
00:24:59,466 --> 00:25:03,133
HALL WILL HAVE YOU KNOW SHE IS

939
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,300
50.

940
00:25:03,366 --> 00:25:07,700
AND HERE SHE IS, THE ONE, THE

941
00:25:07,766 --> 00:25:12,466
ONLY, THE 50 AND FABULOUS TAMRON

942
00:25:12,533 --> 00:25:15,066
HALL!

943
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:18,333
I HAVE, IN MY 40s, NOW THAT

944
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,200
I'M 50.

945
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:20,600
I'M 59.

946
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:23,900
ON A PERSONAL NOTE, I'M 50.

947
00:25:23,966 --> 00:25:26,633
>41 AND DON'T CARE.

948
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,833
WAIT TILL YOU TURN 50.

949
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,933
I'M 50, YOU ARE 54.

950
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,233
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS ON

951
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,033
"SESAME STREET" HAVE BEEN

952
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,142
HELPING KIDS AND FAMILIES AROUND

953
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,566
THE WORLD AND ALL KINDS OF WAYS

954
00:25:37,633 --> 00:25:41,400
FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS.

955
00:25:41,466 --> 00:25:43,966
50 YEARS, THAT'S HOW OLD I AM.

956
00:25:44,033 --> 00:25:44,600
WOW.

957
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:47,700
LISTEN, I AM... AS THE KIDS

958
00:25:47,766 --> 00:25:49,600
SAY, I'M 50.

959
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:52,633
HOW DID I NOT KNOW THAT?

960
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,066
OKAY, I AM 50 YEARS OLD.

961
00:25:56,133 --> 00:25:56,500
I'M 50.

962
00:25:56,566 --> 00:25:57,800
I'M 50.

963
00:25:57,866 --> 00:25:58,033
I'M 50.

964
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,866
THIS IS THE BEST TACO I'VE EVER

965
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,600
HAD IN MY LIFE.

966
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:03,866
I'M 50.

967
00:26:03,933 --> 00:26:04,633
MOVING ON.

968
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,266
BEFORE WE GO, A QUICK WORD ABOUT

969
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:05,800
HAMMERS.

970
00:26:05,866 --> 00:26:06,733
SOME ARE EENSY.

971
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,466
SOME ARE CHONKOS.

972
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:08,576
SOME HAVE A LITTLE CLAW ON THE

973
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,033
END FOR PULLING NAILS.

974
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,900
OTHERS HAVE A LITTLE ROUND NUB

975
00:26:09,966 --> 00:26:14,266
AND NO ONE KNOWS WHY.

976
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:16,033
AND ONE HAMMER IS ACTUALLY A

977
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,600
PRACTICING PERSONAL INJURY

978
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:16,966
ATTORNEY, WHICH

979
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:17,833
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER FROM THIS

980
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,433
"AND NOW" SEGMENT WE AIRED IN

981
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:18,900
2019.

982
00:26:18,966 --> 00:26:19,733
GREEDY INSURANCE COMPANIES

983
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,366
PLAY DIRTY.

984
00:26:20,433 --> 00:26:21,100
BRING IT ON!

985
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:22,500
I'M JIM ADLER, THE TEXAS HAMMER.

986
00:26:22,566 --> 00:26:25,233
I'M JIM ADLER, THE TEXAS HAMMER.

987
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,442
AND I DO MY BEST TO BRING 'EM

988
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:27,133
DOWN!

989
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,833
I GET ANGRIER THAN A JUNKYARD

990
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,100
DOG.

991
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,242
I STAND TOUGH AND CARRY A BIG

992
00:26:32,266 --> 00:26:32,800
HAMMER.

993
00:26:32,866 --> 00:26:33,466
I GROWL AND BARK.

994
00:26:33,533 --> 00:26:34,100
WAKE UP!

995
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:35,266
IT'S HAMMER TIME!

996
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:41,733
I'M JIM ADLER, THE TEXAS HAMMER!

997
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,133
YOU GET THE IDEA,

998
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,366
RIGHT?

999
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:44,300
HE'S THE TEXAS HAMMER.

1000
00:26:44,366 --> 00:26:44,733
HE CARRIES A HAMMER.

1001
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,533
HE TALKS ABOUT HAMMERS.

1002
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,466
FOR A WHILE IN THE MIDDLE HE

1003
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:47,133
TALKS ABOUT GROWLING AND BARKING

1004
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,666
LIKE A DOG, WHICH IS A BIT

1005
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:48,333
CONFUSING, BECAUSE THAT'S NOT A

1006
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:48,966
THING HAMMERS DO, BUT THEN IT'S

1007
00:26:49,033 --> 00:26:50,242
RIGHT BACK TO HAMMER TIME, BABY.

1008
00:26:50,266 --> 00:26:51,033
NOW, WE AIRED THAT BECAUSE WE

1009
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:51,900
THOUGHT HIS ADS WERE FANTASTIC.

1010
00:26:51,966 --> 00:26:52,900
BUT SINCE THEN, WE'VE DISCOVERED

1011
00:26:52,966 --> 00:26:55,500
JUST HOW MUCH MONEY JIM ADLER

1012
00:26:55,566 --> 00:26:56,200
PUTS INTO THEM.

1013
00:26:56,266 --> 00:26:58,200
HE CLAIMS TO HAVE SPENT OVER

1014
00:26:58,266 --> 00:27:00,333
$100 MILLION DOLLARS ON ADS

1015
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,509
SINCE 2000, AND AS YOU CAN SEE

1016
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:02,933
FROM THIS TESTIMONIAL HE ONCE

1017
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,200
FILMED FOR AN AD AGENCY HE

1018
00:27:04,266 --> 00:27:05,000
WORKED WITH, HE PUTS A LOT OF

1019
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:06,833
THOUGHT INTO THEM TOO.

1020
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,333
A LAWYER IN ANOTHER STATE MAY

1021
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,576
NOT WANT TO BE A HAMMER, OR BE A

1022
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,533
TOUGH, SMART LAWYER, BUT THEY

1023
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,100
UNDERSTAND THE IMAGE THAT THE

1024
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:15,966
CLIENT WANTS TO PORTRAY.

1025
00:27:16,033 --> 00:27:16,766
RIGHT.

1026
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:17,700
LAWYERS IN OTHER STATES MIGHT

1027
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:19,000
NOT WANT TO BE TOUGH, SMART

1028
00:27:19,066 --> 00:27:20,833
LAWYERS.

1029
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,909
WISCONSIN LIKES ITS LAWYERS WEAK

1030
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:22,533
AND SIMPLE.

1031
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,300
MICHIGAN PREFERS THEM LEAN AND

1032
00:27:23,366 --> 00:27:24,366
LETHARGIC.

1033
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:25,833
IDAHO WANTS EVERY ATTORNEY TO BE

1034
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,533
DAMP AND DISTRACTED, WHILE HERE

1035
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,366
IN NEW YORK, WE LIKE THEM SWEATY

1036
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:30,066
AND SUSPENDED.

1037
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:32,800
UNFORTUNATELY FOR JIM ADLER

1038
00:27:32,866 --> 00:27:33,766
THOUGH, IT TURNS OUT THERE IS

1039
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:35,833
ANOTHER LAWYER IN ANOTHER STATE

1040
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,800
WHO WANTS TO BE A HAMMER TOO.

1041
00:27:36,866 --> 00:27:37,733
I'M MIKE SLOCUMB.

1042
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,800
THE ALABAMA HAMMER!

1043
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,866
IF YOU'VE BEEN INJURED, CALL ME

1044
00:27:40,933 --> 00:27:41,976
RIGHT NOW AND GET THE BIG CHECK.

1045
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,133
HI, MIKE!

1046
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,766
NICE TO MEET YOU!

1047
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:46,913
NOW, IF YOU'RE NOTICING ANY

1048
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:47,700
SIMILARITIES, YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

1049
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:48,976
BECAUSE WHEN JIM ADLER FOUND OUT

1050
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,266
WHAT MIKE SLOCUMB WAS DOING, HE

1051
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:52,266
FUCKING SUED HIM!

1052
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:53,633
AND WHILE WE CAN'T GET INTO ALL

1053
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,500
OF THE CLAIMS IN HIS VERY FUN

1054
00:27:55,566 --> 00:27:56,766
LAWSUIT, BASICALLY, HE'S

1055
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:58,066
ALLEGING THAT MIKE SLOCUMB...

1056
00:27:58,133 --> 00:27:59,166
THE ALABAMA HAMMER... HAD

1057
00:27:59,233 --> 00:28:00,513
"ADOPTED HIS FAMOUS PERSONA IN A

1058
00:28:00,566 --> 00:28:02,100
BRAZEN BID TO CONFUSE AND

1059
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:03,000
DECEIVE CONSUMERS."

1060
00:28:03,066 --> 00:28:04,900
AND THE THING IS, HE'S NOT JUST

1061
00:28:04,966 --> 00:28:05,633
CLAIMING THE ALABAMA HAMMER IS

1062
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,300
COPYING HIS NICKNAME.

1063
00:28:07,366 --> 00:28:08,133
I'M GOING TO PLAY TWO OF THEIR

1064
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,242
COMMERCIALS SIDE BY SIDE AND SEE

1065
00:28:09,266 --> 00:28:12,033
IF THEY LOOK SIMILAR TO YOU.

1066
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,433
GREEDY INSURANCE COMPANIES

1067
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,766
PLAY DIRTY.

1068
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:15,900
BRING IT ON.

1069
00:28:15,966 --> 00:28:16,866
CHEAP INSURANCE COMPANIES

1070
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:17,933
PLAY ROUGH.

1071
00:28:17,966 --> 00:28:19,366
I BEAT 'EM AT THEIR OWN GAME!

1072
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:20,366
I'M JIM ADLER, THE TEXAS

1073
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:21,500
HAMMER!

1074
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:22,809
I'M MIKE SLOCUMB, THE ALABAMA

1075
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:24,633
HAMMER!

1076
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,566
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT!

1077
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:29,133
OH, COME ON!

1078
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,766
NOW, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, SLOCUMB

1079
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:31,633
DENIES ADLER'S CLAIMS...

1080
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,433
INCLUDING THAT HE COPIED THAT

1081
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,500
AD.

1082
00:28:33,566 --> 00:28:34,933
AND I'M GONNA SAY, GOOD LUCK

1083
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,100
DEFENDING THAT ARGUMENT.

1084
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:39,200
BUT I DO ACTUALLY HAVE A BIT OF

1085
00:28:39,266 --> 00:28:40,200
SYMPATHY FOR MIKE SLOCUMB.

1086
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:40,833
BECAUSE IF YOU WATCH HIS ADS

1087
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,700
THAT AREN'T HAMMER-THEMED, IT

1088
00:28:41,766 --> 00:28:44,233
BECOMES CLEAR HOW MUCH MIKE

1089
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,566
NEEDS THAT GIMMICK.

1090
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:48,533
BECAUSE THEY'RE A TOTAL MESS.

1091
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,233
THERE'S ONE WHERE HE'S A

1092
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,600
"BIG BUCKS" HUNTER WHERE HE

1093
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:52,000
SHOOTS DEER THAT EXPLODE INTO

1094
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:54,033
MONEY, ONE WHERE HE RUNS AFTER

1095
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,400
AN AMBULANCE LIKE A CAROUSEL

1096
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:56,733
HORSE, ONLY TO GET HIT BY A

1097
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,066
DIFFERENT AMBULANCE.

1098
00:28:59,133 --> 00:29:00,900
AND THEN THERE'S THIS:

1099
00:29:00,966 --> 00:29:02,833
GIVE ME MY LUNCH MONEY BACK!

1100
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,980
WHERE'S THE ALABAMA HAMMER?

1101
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:04,833
I'VE BEEN STANDING UP TO

1102
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,300
BULLIES MY WHOLE LIFE.

1103
00:29:06,366 --> 00:29:07,500
WHOO!

1104
00:29:07,566 --> 00:29:08,900
WHOO!

1105
00:29:08,966 --> 00:29:10,076
I'M MIKE SLOCUMB, THE ALABAMA

1106
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:10,666
HAMMER!

1107
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:11,776
IF YOU'VE BEEN INJURED IN A CAR

1108
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,966
WRECK, DON'T LET THE INSURANCE

1109
00:29:14,033 --> 00:29:15,033
COMPANY BULLY YOU.

1110
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:17,566
CALL ME RIGHT NOW!

1111
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:18,266
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?

1112
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:19,033
I'M REALLY CURIOUS WHAT HAPPENED

1113
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:19,600
IN THE NEXT SCENE WHEN THE

1114
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:20,100
POLICE TURNED UP.

1115
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:20,900
"WHO PUNCHED THIS CHILD

1116
00:29:20,966 --> 00:29:21,900
UNCONSCIOUS?"

1117
00:29:21,966 --> 00:29:23,176
"THAT WAS ME, OFFICER, BUT DON'T

1118
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,233
WORRY... IT'S OKAY."

1119
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:24,833
"EXPLAIN HOW, BUT JUST SO YOU

1120
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,166
KNOW, I'M GOING TO GET MY TASER

1121
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:27,100
OUT WHILE YOU TALK."

1122
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:28,466
"WHEN I KNOCKED HIM OUT, I WAS

1123
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:32,366
ALSO A CHILD.

1124
00:29:32,433 --> 00:29:33,000
THEN I SAID 'WHOO, ' IMMEDIATELY

1125
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:35,233
AGED 30 YEARS INTO AN ADULT, AND

1126
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:35,933
SAID 'WHOO' AGAIN."

1127
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,666
"HMM.

1128
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:37,933
SEEMS UNLIKELY, BUT YOU ARE

1129
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,600
WHITE, SO I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND

1130
00:29:38,666 --> 00:29:39,166
GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF THE

1131
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:39,633
DOUBT."

1132
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,733
LOOK, IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR TO

1133
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,233
ME THAT MIKE SLOCUMB RIPPED OFF

1134
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:43,633
THE TEXAS HAMMER.

1135
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,133
AND YOU CAN SEE WHY.

1136
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,766
HIS COMMERCIALS ARE EVERYTHING

1137
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:45,866
CLEAR,

1138
00:29:45,933 --> 00:29:46,633
PRECISE, AND THEMATICALLY

1139
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,966
RESONANT.

1140
00:29:48,033 --> 00:29:49,433
HE'S

1141
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,266
THE TEXAS HAMMER, AND THAT'S IT.

1142
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:54,433
AND I SO BADLY DON'T WANT THESE

1143
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,000
TWO GLORIOUS MANIACS TO FIGHT.

1144
00:29:56,066 --> 00:29:57,600
IT SEEMS THE BEST THING IS FOR

1145
00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:59,033
MIKE SLOCUMB TO SIMPLY GET A

1146
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,276
DIFFERENT TOOL-THEMED NICKNAME

1147
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,000
SO THESE TWO DANGEROUSLY STRANGE

1148
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:05,100
MEN CAN MOVE ON IN PEACE.

1149
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:10,133
AND I ACTUALLY HAVE A SUGGESTION

1150
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,033
FOR YOU, MIKE, AND IT'S THIS

1151
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,300
BANANA SLICER.

1152
00:30:12,366 --> 00:30:12,966
MIKE "THE ALABAMA BANANA SLICER"

1153
00:30:13,033 --> 00:30:13,500
SLOCUMB.

1154
00:30:13,566 --> 00:30:14,400
THINK ABOUT IT... IT WORKS

1155
00:30:14,466 --> 00:30:14,933
PERFECTLY.

1156
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,142
JUST LIKE A HAMMER, IT'S A TOOL.

1157
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:17,000
AND LIKE YOUR COMMERCIALS, IT'S

1158
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:17,633
UNNECESSARY, COMPLICATED, AND I

1159
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,966
DON'T LIKE LOOKING AT IT.

1160
00:30:23,033 --> 00:30:24,833
SO PLEASE, MIKE, TAKE THIS IDEA,

1161
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,133
AND TAKE THIS BANANA SLICER TOO.

1162
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,466
AND THAT'S IT!

1163
00:30:28,533 --> 00:30:29,533
THAT'S OUR SHOW!

1164
00:30:29,566 --> 00:30:31,100
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING

1165
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:33,266
DURING THIS VERY WEIRD TIME.

1166
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,266
THANK YOU TO OUR STAFF

1167
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,542
FOR WORKING SO HARD IN THIS VERY

1168
00:30:36,566 --> 00:30:36,966
DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT.

1169
00:30:37,033 --> 00:30:37,533
WE'LL BE OFF FOR A COUPLE OF

1170
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,600
WEEKS NOW.

1171
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:40,000
BUT WE WILL BE BACK

1172
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:41,666
SEPTEMBER 12TH, DEFINITELY IN A

1173
00:30:41,733 --> 00:30:42,842
STUDIO, MAYBE WITH AN AUDIENCE,

1174
00:30:42,866 --> 00:30:43,533
MAYBE NOT.

1175
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,266
WHO KNOWS?

1176
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,466
BUT THE POINT IS, THAT'S IT!

1177
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:48,900
THAT'S IT?

1178
00:30:48,966 --> 00:30:49,766
LIKE...

1179
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:51,900
YOU'RE ENDING IT?

1180
00:30:51,966 --> 00:30:52,466
YEAH.

1181
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:55,333
THAT'S IT.

1182
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,033
THIS IS WHERE YOU AND I SAY

1183
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:56,466
GOODBYE.

1184
00:30:56,533 --> 00:30:57,400
YOU KNOW, IT IS OUR LAST

1185
00:30:57,466 --> 00:30:58,733
NIGHT TOGETHER, RIGHT?

1186
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,766
SO YOU DIDN'T PLAN ANYTHING?

1187
00:31:00,833 --> 00:31:02,500
UM...

1188
00:31:02,566 --> 00:31:03,800
CONAN GOT A SONG, REMEMBER?

1189
00:31:03,866 --> 00:31:07,833
JACK BLACK SANG A BIG SONG.

1190
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,266
RIGHT, SORRY, DO YOU

1191
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:09,866
THINK YOU'RE THE CONAN IN THIS

1192
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:10,400
DYNAMIC?

1193
00:31:10,466 --> 00:31:11,233
I JUST THOUGHT YOU'D PREPARE

1194
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:11,766
SOMETHING.

1195
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:12,766
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA... YEAH...

1196
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:13,700
YOU KNOW... YOU'RE DOING IN YOUR

1197
00:31:13,766 --> 00:31:14,066
WAY.

1198
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:14,866
THAT'S FINE.

1199
00:31:14,933 --> 00:31:17,733
BYE.

1200
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,500
ALL RIGHT, UM,

1201
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:18,966
ARE YOU SURE?

1202
00:31:19,033 --> 00:31:20,033
YEAH, I SAID I'M FINE.

1203
00:31:20,066 --> 00:31:20,333
SO WE'RE DONE.

1204
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,200
GOODBYE.

1205
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:23,800
AND DEFINITELY NO SONG.

1206
00:31:23,866 --> 00:31:27,166
OKAY, WELL, THANKS FOR

1207
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:28,900
EVERYTHING AND I GUESS, UM, I'LL

1208
00:31:28,966 --> 00:31:31,333
SEE YOU AROUND.

00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,466
UM...

1210
00:31:34,533 --> 00:31:39,200
BYE.

I'M NOT DEAD!

1212
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:02,066
I'M RETURNING TO A STUDIO!

1213
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,000
JESUS CHRIST.

1214
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:13,933
THIS IS A LOT.

1215
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,900
QUEEN ELIZABETH HAD

1216
00:32:24,966 --> 00:32:26,266
PRINCESS DIANA MURDERED.

1217
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:26,833
GOOD NIGHT.
