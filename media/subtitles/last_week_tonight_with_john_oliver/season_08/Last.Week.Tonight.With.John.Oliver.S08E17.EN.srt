1
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,400
HI THERE!

2
00:00:29,466 --> 00:00:30,300
WELCOME TO THE SHOW!

3
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:30,900
STILL COMING TO YOU FROM THIS

4
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:31,800
BLANK VOID.

5
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,333
THINK OF IT LIKE DISNEY WORLD...

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,333
A BRIGHT WONDERLAND WHERE,

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:34,966
FOR SOME REASON,

8
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:35,900
PEOPLE GET EXCITED TO SEE

9
00:00:35,966 --> 00:00:37,800
A LARGE, PANTSLESS BIRD.

10
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:39,333
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,666
RUDY GIULIANI'S LAW LICENSE WAS

12
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:42,033
SUSPENDED, THE SUPREME COURT

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,366
RELEASED A SERIES OF RULINGS,

14
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:44,300
ONE OF WHICH INVOLVED

15
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:45,733
JUSTICE BREYER HAVING TO EXPLAIN

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,800
WHAT SNAPCHAT WAS,

17
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,066
AND THEN THERE WAS THIS:

18
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:49,209
SENATE REPUBLICANS TONIGHT

19
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:50,800
BLOCKING A DEMOCRATIC VOTING

20
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:52,466
BILL THAT WOULD HAVE OVERHAULED

21
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:54,666
THE COUNTRY'S ELECTION SYSTEM.

22
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:55,666
REPUBLICANS TONIGHT SLAMMING

23
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:57,100
THE BILL AS A PARTISAN POWER

24
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,033
GRAB BY DEMOCRATS THAT WOULD

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,633
FEDERALIZE ELECTIONS, INCLUDING

26
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,233
PREVENTING STATES FROM REQUIRING

27
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,333
VOTER I.D.

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,966
S1 WOULD TAKE AWAY THE RIGHTS

29
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,566
OF PEOPLE IN EACH OF THE

30
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:11,800
50 STATES TO DETERMINE WHICH

31
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:14,400
ELECTION RULES WORK BEST FOR

32
00:01:14,466 --> 00:01:16,266
THEIR CITIZENS.

33
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,000
WELL....

34
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:19,000
YEAH, IT WOULD.

35
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:20,900
BECAUSE HISTORY SHOWS CERTAIN

36
00:01:20,966 --> 00:01:22,766
PEOPLE IN CERTAIN STATES HAVE

37
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,166
DETERMINED WHICH ELECTION RULES

38
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:29,233
WORK BEST FOR CERTAIN CITIZENS.

39
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,300
PROBLEM,

40
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:33,000
THAT'S THE WHOLE FUCKING

41
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:34,000
PROBLEM, COLLINS.

42
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:35,176
YOUR PARTY MIGHT KNOW THAT IF IT

43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,100
WASN'T SO BUSY FIGHTING TO COVER

44
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:36,800
UP THAT HISTORY.

45
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:38,042
ALTHOUGH I DO GET IT, IF I HAD

46
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:39,233
THE POWER TO COVER UP PAST

47
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:39,933
MISTAKES, I'D PROBABLY ERASE

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,800
THE WHOLE DRUMPF THING FROM

49
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:42,566
THE INTERNET, ALONG WITH ABOUT

50
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:43,700
TWO DECADES OF HAIRCUTS.

51
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:44,533
BUT, LIKE MY BARBER/THERAPIST

52
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,733
TELLS ME, "WE CAN'T CHANGE

53
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,266
HISTORY, WE CAN ONLY PREVENT IT

54
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:47,966
FROM HAPPENING AGAIN."

55
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:49,433
AND THE DEFEAT OF THIS BILL

56
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,660
COMES AS REPUBLICANS IN STATE

57
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,876
LEGISLATURES HAVE PUSHED NEARLY

58
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,100
400 NEW BILLS AND LAWS

59
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:56,166
RESTRICTING VOTING RIGHTS,

60
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:58,233
WHICH, IN MANY CASES, ARE FUELED

61
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,833
BY LIES ABOUT VOTER FRAUD IN

62
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,800
THE LAST ELECTION, DESPITE THOSE

63
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:03,976
LIES CONTINUALLY FALLING APART.

64
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,200
JUST THIS WEEK, A MICHIGAN

65
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:07,866
REPUBLICAN-LED SENATE

66
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:08,766
INVESTIGATION PUBLISHED A REPORT

67
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:09,766
FINDING "NO EVIDENCE OF

68
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:10,700
WIDESPREAD OR SYSTEMATIC FRAUD

69
00:02:10,766 --> 00:02:11,566
IN THE STATE'S HANDLING OF

70
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:13,233
THE ELECTION."

71
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,442
AND THERE'S ACTUALLY ANOTHER,

72
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:16,733
EVEN WILDER CLAIM THAT'S

73
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,233
UNRAVELING IN TRULY SPECTACULAR

74
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,033
FASHION.

75
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,700
IT'S SOMETHING CALLED

76
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:21,666
"ITALYGATE," WHICH ISN'T

77
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:23,000
ACTUALLY REFERRING TO THE MANY

78
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:24,666
TIMES THE CUOMO BROTHERS DID

79
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:26,366
"NEWS INCEST," BUT IT IS A SPICY

80
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:28,200
MEAT-A-BALL OF A CONSPIRACY.

81
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:29,900
AND THERE WERE SOME DEVELOPMENTS

82
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:31,833
EARLIER THIS MONTH, WHEN EMAILS

83
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,233
SURFACED BETWEEN MARK MEADOWS,

84
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,833
TRUMP'S CHIEF OF STAFF, AND

85
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,066
THE ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL

86
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:37,066
THAT WERE SENT LAST DECEMBER.

87
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:38,213
AMONG MEADOWS' REQUESTS:

88
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:39,933
THAT ROSEN LOOK INTO ITALYGATE,

89
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
A CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT PEOPLE

90
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:43,566
IN ITALY USED MILITARY

91
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:45,033
TECHNOLOGY AND SATELLITES TO

92
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,566
SWITCH TRUMP VOTES TO BIDEN

93
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,833
VOTES IN U.S. VOTING MACHINES.

94
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,700
RIGHT.

95
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:51,600
THE THEORY IS, MILITARY

96
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:52,533
SATELLITES APPARENTLY STOLE

97
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,766
THE ELECTION.

98
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,533
AND I KNOW THAT SOUNDS STUPID,

99
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,400
AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS.

100
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:58,746
AND IT GOT EARLY TRACTION THANKS

101
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,133
TO THIS JOURNALIST, WHO'S BEEN

102
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,800
CALLED "THE SEAN HANNITY OF

103
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:01,866
ITALY."

104
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:02,633
WHICH ALREADY MIGHT BE THE

105
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,709
MEANEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD

106
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:06,200
IN MY LIFE.

107
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:07,442
BUT THE KEY QUESTION STILL IS,

108
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:07,966
HOW DID THAT THEORY GET TO

109
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:09,600
THE WHITE HOUSE?

110
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,766
WELL, LAST WEEKEND,

111
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,133
"THE WASHINGTON POST" FILLED IN

112
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,666
A KEY CONNECTION, AND I'M GOING

113
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:15,066
TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT NOT BECAUSE

114
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:16,142
IT'S IMPORTANT, BUT BECAUSE IT

115
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,166
IS INCREDIBLE.

116
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,700
AND IT CONCERNS THIS WOMAN,

117
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:20,633
MICHELE ROOSEVELT EDWARDS,

118
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,833
A BUSINESSWOMAN AND SOLE

119
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,933
SURVIVING CONSUMER OF

120
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,500
THE "BUMP IT."

121
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:25,966
THE EMAIL MEADOWS SENT

122
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:27,500
CONCERNING ITALYGATE INCLUDED

123
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:29,066
THIS LETTER, WHICH OUTLINED

124
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:30,600
THE CONSPIRACY, AND WAS PRINTED

125
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,033
ON THE LETTERHEAD OF A COMPANY

126
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,033
EDWARDS RUNS.

127
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,733
AND IT DOESN'T STOP THERE...

128
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,333
BECAUSE ANOTHER OF HER FIRMS WAS

129
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,766
PUSHING THE ITALYGATE CLAIMS

130
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,300
AROUND THE SAME TIME.

131
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:40,666
AND WHILE EDWARDS CLAIMS SHE WAS

132
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:42,133
UNAWARE OF THAT LETTER, THE MORE

133
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,566
YOU LEARN ABOUT HER, THE HARDER

134
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:44,642
IT IS TO TAKE ANYTHING SHE SAYS

135
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,500
AT FACE VALUE.

136
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:47,833
BECAUSE THIS WOMAN HAS LIVED

137
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,133
MANY AMAZING LIVES.

138
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,200
AFTER UNSUCCESSFULLY RUNNING

139
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:53,426
FOR CONGRESS IN THE '80s, SHE

140
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,066
HAD A STINT DESIGNING CHILDREN'S

141
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:56,066
CLOTHING, SAYING SHE WAS

142
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:57,400
"KNOWN AS THE COCO CHANEL IN

143
00:03:57,466 --> 00:03:58,800
THE CHILDREN'S INDUSTRY,"

144
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:01,033
A CLAIM SUPPORTED BY NO ONE.

145
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,900
SHE LATER REINVENTED HERSELF

146
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:04,900
AS A PEACE BROKER FOR

147
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:07,433
THE SOMALI PEOPLE, TELLING

148
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,066
INTERVIEWERS, "THEY CALL ME

149
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:09,800
THE MOTHER OF SOMALIA, I HAVE

150
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:11,566
NINE MILLION CHILDREN."

151
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:12,676
AND WHO, EXACTLY, ARE "THEY"

152
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,233
THERE?

153
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,466
BECAUSE UNLESS THE SOMALI PEOPLE

154
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:17,900
UNANIMOUSLY VOTED TO REFER TO

155
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,100
WHAT YOU'D GET IF

156
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,866
CALLISTA GINGRICH STUCK A FORK

157
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:22,233
INTO AN OUTLET AS

158
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,300
"THEIR NATIONAL MOMMY,"

159
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:24,609
I'M REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO STOP

160
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:26,000
YOU RIGHT THERE.

161
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,333
AND AS EDWARDS EAGERLY INSERTED

162
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,933
HERSELF INTO SOMALI AFFAIRS,

163
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,242
A NAVAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER WHO

164
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:32,166
ONCE WORKED WITH HER WAS QUOTED

165
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:32,300
NO

166
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:33,700
AS SAYING, "THE PROBLEM WITH

167
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:34,500
MICHELE IS SEPARATING FACT FROM

168
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,400
FICTION.

169
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:36,933
WHAT IS REAL, AND WHAT IS

170
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,433
MADE UP?"

171
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,576
TO WHICH I'D SAY, "FOR A START,

172
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,742
MAYBE THE NINE MILLION CHILDREN

173
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:42,266
THING."

174
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,600
BUT WAIT, IT DOESN'T STOP THERE.

175
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,466
BECAUSE EARLIER THIS YEAR,

176
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:47,933
EDWARDS WAS FEATURED ON THIS

177
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,533
TV SHOW IN ICELAND, AFTER TAKING

178
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,866
OVER AN AIRLINE THERE... IT'S

179
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:51,833
CALLED "WOW" AIR... IT'S

180
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,109
TERRIBLE; THAT'S NOT THE POINT;

181
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:53,200
NO

182
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:53,833
WE DON'T HAVE TIME.

183
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,566
AND DURING THE INTERVIEW,

184
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:57,000
SHE TOOK THE REPORTER ON A TOUR

185
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:59,966
OF HER VAST, $30 MILLION

186
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:00,333
VIRGINIA ESTATE.

187
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,833
ALTHOUGH IT WAS CLEAR STRAIGHT

188
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,833
AWAY SOMETHING WAS OFF.

189
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,533
IT'S NEARLY 1,500 ACRES.

190
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,800
IT TAKES 11 PEOPLE FULL-TIME

191
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:08,133
TO MANAGE THE OUTSIDE OF THE

192
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,866
PROPERTY ON A FULL-TIME BASIS.

193
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:11,866
38,000 FEET, 22 BEDROOMS,

194
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:14,433
THREE KITCHENS.

195
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:14,566
NO

196
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:15,200
HOW MANY OF THEM DO YOU USE?

197
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:16,866
ALL THREE.

198
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:21,033
THAT'S WHY THE CHEF'S HERE.

199
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,633
THE KITCHENS WERE ACTUALLY

200
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,200
PRETTY EMPTY, HARDLY ANY SIGNS

201
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:24,100
OF ACTIVITY.

202
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,066
AND THE MASTER CHEF WAS NOT

203
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:26,366
ON HAND EITHER TO BREW COFFEE:

204
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:27,500
THAT CAME IN A BOX FROM A

205
00:05:27,566 --> 00:05:29,500
DOUGHNUT CHAIN.

206
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:31,533
OKAY, SO JUST TO MAKE

207
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,000
SURE I HAVE THIS STRAIGHT... SHE

208
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,800
EMPLOYS 11 PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE

209
00:05:35,866 --> 00:05:37,100
OF HER 1500 ACRE ESTATE THAT

210
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,933
CONTAINS THREE KITCHENS, NO

211
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,766
PERSONAL EFFECTS, AND ONE MAN

212
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,433
WHOSE JOB SEEMS TO BE TO POUR

213
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,609
TAKEOUT DUNKIN' INTO A STYROFOAM

214
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:42,700
NO

215
00:05:42,766 --> 00:05:44,666
CUP WHILE DRESSED LIKE THE FIRST

216
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:45,300
RESULT YOU GET WHEN YOU GOOGLE

217
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:47,633
"SILLY CARTOON CHEF."

218
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,633
AND IF IT SEEMED LIKE

219
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:55,266
THE REPORTER IS HINTING AT

220
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,133
SOMETHING THERE, IT'S BECAUSE

221
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,266
HE VERY MUCH WAS.

222
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,666
BEFORE WE WRAP UP... BECAUSE

223
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,600
WE STARTED WITH A TOUR OF YOUR

224
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,033
HOME, WHEN I WAS JUST LOOKING OF

225
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,933
WHERE I SHOULD GO ON... IN A

226
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,400
SEARCH ENGINE, THE STUFF THAT

227
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:05,546
CAME UP WAS ALL REAL ESTATE

228
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,760
LISTINGS, AND THAT THIS PLACE

229
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,266
WAS FOR SALE.

230
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:07,933
MMM-HM.

231
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,666
IS IT FOR SALE?

232
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:09,033
NO.

233
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,833
IT'S NOT NOW.

234
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,976
AND HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN

235
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,133
HERE?

236
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,966
THIS IS A RECENT ACQUISITION

237
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:13,033
FOR US.

238
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,266
IT'S VERY SORT OF...

239
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,166
IT'S VERY FORMAL.

240
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:17,200
IT'S ALMOST LIKE WALKING INTO

241
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:18,533
A... A RENTED PROPERTY.

242
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,266
NO.

243
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,266
IT'S NOT RENTED PROPERTY,

244
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,666
I CAN ASSURE YOU.

245
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:22,666
SO THIS IS WHERE YOU LIVE,

246
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:23,733
THIS IS YOUR HOME.

247
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:24,200
YES, THIS IS...

248
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:24,900
THIS IS YOUR PROPERTY.

249
00:06:24,966 --> 00:06:28,933
YES.

250
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,366
NO, IT ISN'T.

251
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:32,533
BECAUSE OF COURSE IT ISN'T!

252
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,866
IN FACT, THE ACTUAL OWNER OF

253
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:35,300
THAT PROPERTY WAS SHOWN THAT

254
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:35,900
VIDEO AND SAID, "SHE'S IN MY

255
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:36,866
HOUSE.

256
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:40,266
HOW IS SHE IN MY HOUSE?"

257
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:40,900
WHICH IS JUST SPECTACULAR.

258
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:42,066
AND THE ANSWER MAY BE THAT

259
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:43,500
EDWARDS... IN ADDITION TO BEING

260
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:45,366
THE COCO CHANEL FOR CHILDREN AND

261
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:47,133
THE SOMALI MOMMY... HAS ALSO

262
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,300
BEEN A LICENSED REALTOR IN

263
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,533
THE AREA, WHICH I'M GUESSING IS

264
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,676
HELPFUL WHEN SHE NEEDS A NEW

265
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,200
PLACE TO NOT-LIVE.

266
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:54,533
AND THE THING IS, THIS STORY

267
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,966
IS FUNNY BECAUSE IT'S A

268
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:00,800
CARTOONISHLY DESPERATE ATTEMPT

269
00:07:00,866 --> 00:07:01,500
TO STEAL AN ELECTION,

270
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:02,466
WHICH SOMEHOW INVOLVES

271
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:03,066
A SQUATTER DRESSED AS

272
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:03,833
ORVILLE REDDENBACHER'S

273
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,766
FIRST WIFE WHO GOT WRITTEN OUT

274
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:05,433
OF THE WILL.

275
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,333
AND I'M GLAD I GOT TO TELL YOU

276
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,133
ABOUT IT.

277
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,900
BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO

278
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:08,900
REMEMBER, THERE ARE FAR MORE

279
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:10,400
EFFECTIVE METHODS UNDERMINING

280
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:11,626
DEMOCRACY AS WE SPEAK... LIKE

281
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,133
ALLOWING STATES TO PASS LAWS

282
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,466
RESTRICTING BALLOT ACCESS.

283
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:19,866
THE BULLSHIT ARTISTS TO REALLY

284
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:20,700
WATCH OUT FOR ARE THE ONES

285
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:22,233
URGING CIVILITY WHILE ARGUING

286
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,133
IT'S NONE OF OUR BUSINESS

287
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,966
PEOPLE FROM VOTING, NOT THE ONES

288
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:25,100
NO

289
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:25,700
WEARING GOLD BOW TIES IN HOMES

290
00:07:25,766 --> 00:07:27,009
THEY DON'T OWN, THEY'RE THE ONES

291
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:27,566
URGING CIVILITY WHILE ARGUING

292
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:29,733
THAT IT'S NONE OF OUR BUSINESS

293
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,766
NO IF SOME STATES WANT TO BAR

294
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,200
PEOPLE FROM VOTING, BECAUSE THAT

295
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:34,400
IS THE KIND OF BEHAVIOR THAT

296
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:36,133
SHOULD MAKE US ALL STAND UP AND

297
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,133
SAY, SHE IS IN OUR GOVERNMENT,

298
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,733
HOW IS SHE IN OUR GOVERNMENT?

299
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
AND NOW THIS.

300
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,033
AND NOW...

301
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,733
ON THE OCCASION OF HIS DEPARTURE

302
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,600
FROM C-SPAN, ONE LAST SALUTE TO

303
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:48,400
THE MOST PATIENT MAN ON

304
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:49,366
TELEVISION.

305
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:51,700
NEXT UP IS LOUIS.

306
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:52,433
GOOD MORNING, WELCOME TO THE

307
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:52,833
CONVERSATION.

308
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,133
YES, HI.

309
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,100
GO AHEAD, PLEASE.

310
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,166
HELLO?

311
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,733
YES, YOU ARE ON THE AIR,

312
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,666
GO AHEAD.

313
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:01,766
OH, ON AIR WHERE?

314
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:02,433
C-SPAN?

315
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,233
YES, GO AHEAD, GOOD MORNING.

316
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,533
WHEN A PRO-TRUMPER COMES ON

317
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,633
THERE, YOU INTERRUPT THEM, ASK

318
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,566
THEM QUESTIONS, TRYING TO BACK

319
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:12,200
THEM DOWN FROM BEING A

320
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:14,233
PRO-TRUMPER.

321
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,500
BUT YET AN ANTI-TRUMPER, YOU

322
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:16,400
HAVE A NASTY HABIT OF LETTING

323
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:23,500
THEM RANT AND RAVE.

324
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:24,500
WHAT WE NEED IS ANOTHER

325
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:25,033
EDWARD R. MURROW, WHO WENT

326
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,833
TO WAR.

327
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,600
WALTER CRONKITE, WHO WENT TO

328
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,266
WAR.

329
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,633
BUT INSTEAD, WE GOT YOU, STEVE.

330
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,500
MY COMMENTS ARE OKAY.

331
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:31,233
YOU ARE SOUNDING LOUD AND

332
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:31,900
CLEAR.

333
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:33,133
VERY GOOD.

334
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,033
WHAT TOPIC ARE WE SPEAKING

335
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,100
ABOUT, BECAUSE I AM...

336
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,300
I AM AGAINST THE WORD

337
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:42,700
"GODDAMN" BEING USED ON THE

338
00:08:42,766 --> 00:08:44,566
AIRWAVES.

339
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:46,100
AND YOU JUST USED IT.

340
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,266
YOU GUYS ARE NOTHING BUT

341
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:47,700
HACKS.

342
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:51,166
PLEASE DON'T CUT ME OFF.

343
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:52,133
I KNOW I SEE YOUR HAND GOING

344
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,133
THERE, GETTING READY TO CUT ME

345
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,442
OFF, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH

346
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:54,666
THE TRUTH.

347
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:55,566
AND THAT SHOULDN'T BE TOO

348
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:56,433
MUCH... OH, DON'T REACH FOR THE

349
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,633
BUTTON.

350
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,766
I AM MAKING GOOD POINTS.

351
00:08:58,833 --> 00:08:59,866
NO, I AM REACHING FOR

352
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:00,633
"THE NEW YORK TIMES."

353
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,533
I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE CAN SHOW

354
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,733
THE THREE HEADLINES HERE.

355
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,600
PLEASE CONTINUE.

356
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,066
OKAY.

357
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:08,333
UM...

358
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,966
MOVING ON.

359
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:12,033
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT

360
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:13,433
CONCERNS HEALTH CARE, THE FIELD

361
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,133
RESPONSIBLE FOR REPAIRING

362
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,533
ORGANS, TREATING CANCER, AND

363
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,000
REMOVING FOREIGN OBJECTS FROM

364
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:19,500
RECTUMS, WHICH HAVE RECENTLY

365
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:20,576
INCLUDED A "PLASTIC TURTLE,"

366
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,066
A "FORK," "SIX MAGIC MARKERS,"

367
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:25,433
AND A "CAT TOY BELL" WHICH,

368
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,166
CREDIT WHERE ITS DUE, IS THE

369
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:27,800
MOST PROMISING ADVANCEMENT IN

370
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:29,000
CAT HIDING PLACES SINCE

371
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:31,166
"UNDER THE DRESSER."

372
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:33,200
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IS A BIG

373
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:34,533
PROBLEM IN AMERICA, AND ONE OF

374
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,900
THE KEY REASONS IS THAT HEALTH

375
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:37,166
INSURANCE IS OFTEN LINKED TO

376
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:38,333
EMPLOYMENT.

377
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:38,900
WHY IS THAT THE CASE?

378
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:41,300
WELL, BECAUSE WE DO IT WRONG.

379
00:09:41,366 --> 00:09:43,433
THERE'S A RIGHT WAY TO DO IT,

380
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,266
BUT WE DON'T DO IT THAT WAY.

381
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,100
WE DO IT THE WRONG WAY.

382
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,766
AND THIS IS A PARTICULAR PROBLEM

383
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,800
AT THE MOMENT, BECAUSE

384
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:51,400
EMPLOYMENT IS STILL DOWN

385
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,600
7.6 MILLION JOBS FROM ITS

386
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,766
PRE-PANDEMIC LEVEL.

387
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,166
ALL OF WHICH MEANS MANY ARE

388
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:57,066
STRUGGLING TO FIND HEALTH CARE

389
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:59,666
COVERAGE RIGHT NOW.

390
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:02,300
SO THEY MIGHT BE INTRIGUED IF

391
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:03,409
THEY STUMBLE ON AN AD LIKE THIS.

392
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:04,442
MY HEALTH CARE COSTS WERE

393
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:05,166
GONNA DOUBLE THIS YEAR.

394
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:06,100
DOUBLE.

395
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:06,866
DOUBLED.

396
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:08,009
IT WAS DOWN TO HEALTH CARE OR

397
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:09,500
MY STUDENT LOANS.

398
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:10,766
I FOUND A BETTER WAY.

399
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:11,633
IT'S NEIGHBORS HELPING

400
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,733
NEIGHBORS.

401
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,566
LIBERTY HEALTHSHARE.

402
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:15,466
IT'S FREEDOM FROM INSURANCE.

403
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:16,933
AT LIBERTY HEALTHSHARE,

404
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,266
WE SUPPORT EACH OTHER AND KEEP

405
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,366
HEALTH COSTS DOWN.

406
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:20,200
WE'RE CHANGING THE WAY

407
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:22,200
YOU'RE PAYING FOR HEALTH CARE.

408
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:23,800
THIS IS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.

409
00:10:23,866 --> 00:10:24,976
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

410
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,600
TOGETHER.

411
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,800
WELL, HOLD ON, BECAUSE

412
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:29,366
I'M NOT SURE HOW "TOGETHER"

413
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:30,500
YOU ALL ARE.

414
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:32,033
WHAT I SAW THERE WAS A BUNCH OF

415
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,466
PEOPLE TOGETHER WITH WARM LENS

416
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,600
FLARES, AND THEN ONE WEIRD OLDER

417
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:36,533
MAN VERY MUCH ON HIS OWN IN

418
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,000
BLACK AND WHITE.

419
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:39,109
HE'S IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

420
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:39,833
THING, AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO

421
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,066
SAY WHY, BUT ON SOME LEVEL,

422
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:43,366
I THINK WE ALL KNOW.

423
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:44,609
THAT AD IS FOR SOMETHING CALLED

424
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:46,100
A HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRY.

425
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,566
AND IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF THEM

426
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:48,742
BEFORE, YOU MAY HAVE COME ACROSS

427
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:50,166
ONE AND NOT EVEN REALIZED IT,

428
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,309
BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN GROWING

429
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,400
FAST IN THE U.S.

430
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:54,642
AND THE KEY PHRASE IN THAT AD IS

431
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,500
"FREEDOM FROM INSURANCE."

432
00:10:57,566 --> 00:10:58,966
BECAUSE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

433
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,433
TO KNOW ABOUT HEALTH CARE

434
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,000
SHARING MINISTRIES... OR HCSMs

435
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:03,266
...ISN'T JUST THAT THEY CAN BE

436
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,866
CHEAPER THAN HEALTH INSURANCE,

437
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:06,933
WHICH THEY CAN, IT'S THAT

438
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
THEY'RE ALSO NOT

439
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:09,733
HEALTH INSURANCE.

440
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,400
GENERALLY, THEY'RE NONPROFITS

441
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:12,476
WHERE PEOPLE WHO SHARE RELIGIOUS

442
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,400
BELIEFS... USUALLY CHRISTIANITY

443
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:14,900
...AGREE TO HELP COVER

444
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,533
EACH OTHERS' MEDICAL BILLS.

445
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,933
HERE IS A HEARTWARMING STORY

446
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,933
ABOUT WHAT ONE OF THEM LOOKS

447
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,300
LIKE IN PRACTICE.

448
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:21,700
WE'RE PRAYING FOR A YOUNG

449
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:23,300
LADY NAMED KIMBERLY.

450
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:24,566
BOB STEADMAN AND HIS FAMILY

451
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,833
ARE PRAYING FOR SOMEONE THEY'VE

452
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,133
NEVER MET.

453
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,533
SHE HAD A SHUNT INSTALLED

454
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,900
IN HER BRAIN.

455
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:32,176
THEY'VE ALSO PREPARED A CARD

456
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,566
WITH A CHECK FOR $561.

457
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:36,166
TO BEAR HER BURDEN BY SENDING

458
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:37,666
THEM SOME MONEY.

459
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:39,100
A SCENE LIKE THIS PLAYS OUT

460
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,433
HERE ONCE A MONTH.

461
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,300
IT DOES TAKE A MEASURE OF

462
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:42,633
FAITH TO DO IT.

463
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,933
WE ARE SHARING.

464
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,666
THIS IS SO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT

465
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:48,033
WE'RE USED TO IN OUR SOCIETY.

466
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,233
HE'S RIGHT.

467
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,633
PEOPLE ACTUALLY LOOKING OUT

468
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,733
FOR EACH OTHER DOES SOUND BETTER

469
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,866
THAN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM,

470
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:55,900
GET SICK, HAVE

471
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:56,900
INSURANCE DECLINE COVERAGE,

472
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,433
AND THEN HOPE DEBRA MESSING

473
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,666
RETWEETS YOUR GOFUNDME.

474
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:00,300
THAT'S GREAT, DEBRA, BUT DID YOU

475
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:00,833
DONATE?

476
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,200
DID YOU?

477
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:05,300
DID YOU, DEBRA?

478
00:12:05,366 --> 00:12:07,300
AND IT DOES FEEL MORE PERSONAL,

479
00:12:07,366 --> 00:12:08,566
SENDING $500 A MONTH TO

480
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:09,642
A STRANGER IN NEED THAN TO

481
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:10,733
A COMPANY THAT SOUNDS LIKE

482
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,700
SOMEONE MADE UP A WORD AFTER

483
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:14,033
GETTING A SHITTY SCRABBLE HAND.

484
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,333
PERHAPS THAT'S WHY THE

485
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,609
LOCAL-NEWS TEAM WHO COVERED THAT

486
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:17,709
STORY SEEMED SO MOVED AFTER IT

487
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:19,166
ENDED.

488
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:20,066
I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE

489
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:21,176
BEING THAT PERSON AND GETTING

490
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,400
THE CHECK IN THE MAIL?

491
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:23,133
YOU KNOW, NOT KNOWING THAT

492
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,733
SOMEONE WAS GONNA HELP YOU AND

493
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,533
THEN SUDDENLY YOU HAVE ALL THIS

494
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,166
HELP?

495
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:25,966
RIGHT.

496
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:27,333
IT'S ALL ABOUT FAITH, ISN'T IT?

497
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,200
FAITH THAT IT'S GONNA GET PAID.

498
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:28,900
FAITH IN GOD.

499
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:29,966
AND IT'S JUST AMAZING.

500
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,466
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

501
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:32,100
YEAH, OF COURSE THEY'RE

502
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:32,833
INTO THIS SHIT.

503
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,266
FAITH?

504
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,066
STRANGERS?

505
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:35,533
COMING TOGETHER?

506
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,000
THROW IN A RUNAWAY DOG WHO FOUND

507
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:38,333
HIS OWNER IN THE HOSPITAL EVEN

508
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,633
THOUGH HE'D NEVER BEEN TO

509
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,200
THE HOSPITAL AND YOU'VE GOT

510
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:42,466
YOURSELF A SCHEDULE ONE LOCAL

511
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:44,066
NEWS THIRST TRAP.

512
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:45,266
AND HCSMs ARE DEFINITELY AN

513
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,966
ALTERNATIVE.

514
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,833
BUT AS YOU'VE PROBABLY GUESSED

515
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,966
BECAUSE YOU'RE LEARNING ABOUT

516
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:52,600
THEM ON THIS SHOW, AND NOT

517
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:53,876
"WHAT IF JOHN OLIVER WAS SOMEHOW

518
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,433
LESS ANGRY, LESS ENGLISH, AND

519
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,533
HAD JACK RYAN MONEY?"

520
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,933
THERE ARE ALSO SOME SIGNIFICANT

521
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,533
DRAWBACKS, WHICH, DEPENDING ON

522
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,000
THE COMPANY IN QUESTION,

523
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:00,866
CAN RANGE FROM THE DISQUIETING

524
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:03,233
TO THE DISQUALIFYING.

525
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,200
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

526
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:08,033
HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRIES.

527
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,176
WHAT THEY ARE, WHAT THEY DO, AND

528
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,466
MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHAT THEY

529
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:12,742
DON'T DO, AND THE FIRST THING TO

530
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:13,633
KNOW IS, HCSMs HAVE ACTUALLY

531
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,600
EXISTED IN THE UNITED STATES FOR

532
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,533
DECADES, TRADITIONALLY SERVING

533
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,000
SMALL, INSULAR COMMUNITIES LIKE

534
00:13:18,066 --> 00:13:20,500
MENNONITES AND THE AMISH.

535
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,233
HOWEVER, THE 2010 AFFORDABLE

536
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,733
CARE ACT INCLUDED A LOOPHOLE

537
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,000
THAT EXEMPTED UNINSURED PEOPLE

538
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:27,300
FROM PAYING THE TAX PENALTY IF

539
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:29,766
THEY WERE A MEMBER OF AN HCSM.

540
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,366
AND THAT WAS CLEARLY IMMEDIATELY

541
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:34,466
APPEALING TO ANYONE WHO WANTED

542
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:36,100
TO OPT O OF OBAMACARE.

543
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,366
IN FACT, SOME HCSMs,

544
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:38,900
LIKE LIBERTY HEALTHSHARE,

545
00:13:38,966 --> 00:13:39,566
ONE OF THE BIGGEST MINISTRIES,

546
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:40,673
HAVE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED

547
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:43,366
A CONSERVATIVE AUDIENCE.

548
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:44,473
LIBERTY HAS RUN ADS ON THE

549
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,100
BLAZE, AND ALSO SPONSORED CPAC

550
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,700
...IN FACT, REMEMBER THAT FAMOUS

551
00:13:47,766 --> 00:13:49,733
MOMENT WHEN TRUMP MOLESTED

552
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,000
THE FLAG?

553
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:51,066
THE LIBERTY LOGO WAS AN

554
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,733
EYEWITNESS.

555
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,166
AND LIBERTY EVEN MADE ITS SALES

556
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:56,166
PITCH DIRECTLY TO THE CPAC

557
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:56,933
AUDIENCE DURING PANELS LIKE

558
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,233
THIS ONE.

559
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,566
IF YOU WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO

560
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:01,966
TAKE CARE OF YOU AND YOU THINK

561
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:02,833
THEY DO A GREAT JOB DOING IT,

562
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,366
HEALTH SHARING IS NOT FOR YOU.

563
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:05,866
IF YOU WANNA STICK IT TO 'EM,

564
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:06,666
SIGN UP FOR LIBERTY

565
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:14,700
HEALTHSHARE.

566
00:14:15,933 --> 00:14:16,966
ON A LIST OF THE WORST

567
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:19,000
SOUNDS KNOWN TO MAN,

568
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:19,966
"SELF-SATISFIED CPAC LAUGHTER"

569
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:21,266
HAS TO BE RIGHT NEAR THE TOP,

570
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,666
BEAT ONLY BY "WEEPING KITTEN"

571
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:24,233
AND "MOTHER'S ORGASM."

572
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,233
NOW, THAT AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

573
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,933
LOOPHOLE DID TRY TO PUT SOME

574
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,176
LIMITS IN PLACE, TO KEEP THINGS

575
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,700
FROM GETTING OUT OF HAND.

576
00:14:29,766 --> 00:14:31,033
IT STATED THAT YOUR MINISTRY...

577
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,142
OR, CRUCIALLY, A PREDECESSOR OF

578
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,700
IT, HAD TO HAVE BEEN IN

579
00:14:33,766 --> 00:14:36,300
CONTINUOUS EXISTENCE SINCE 1999.

580
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:37,766
BUT THAT PREDECESSOR DETAIL

581
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,000
LEFT ROOM FOR EXPLOITATION.

582
00:14:40,066 --> 00:14:41,466
BECAUSE NEW MINISTRIES SIMPLY

583
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:43,633
STARTED AFFILIATING THEMSELVES

584
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,100
WITH PREVIOUSLY-EXISTING

585
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,166
CHURCHES.

586
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:45,933
TAKE ONE CALLED

587
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,400
TRINITY HEALTHSHARE.

588
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:49,746
IT WAS FOUNDED IN 2018, WHICH IS

589
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,266
...AND THIS IS TRUE... AFTER

590
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,266
1999, BUT IT ARGUED THAT IT

591
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,633
STILL QUALIFIED, BECAUSE IT

592
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,966
"DERIVED ITS EXISTENCE FROM THE

593
00:14:57,033 --> 00:14:58,466
BAPTIST CHURCH, WHICH HAS BEEN

594
00:14:58,533 --> 00:14:59,866
IN EXISTENCE AND CONTINUALLY

595
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,500
SHARING SINCE THE 1600s."

596
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:04,333
WHICH IS OBVIOUS BULLSHIT.

597
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,609
IT'S LIKE ME CLAIMING THIS SHOW

598
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:07,100
HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 13 BILLION

599
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,633
YEARS BECAUSE THE BIG BANG WAS

600
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,976
ALSO A BRIGHT EXPANSE CONTAINING

601
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,600
EXTREMELY DENSE MATERIAL.

602
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:14,742
THAT'S JUST NOT HOW ANYTHING

603
00:15:14,766 --> 00:15:15,233
WORKS.

604
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,833
SO A LOOPHOLE THAT WAS INTENDED

605
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,566
TO BE SMALL GOT PRETTY BIG...

606
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:20,333
AND EVEN BIGGER ONCE OBAMACARE'S

607
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,676
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE STOPPED BEING

608
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,866
ENFORCED DURING THE TRUMP YEARS.

609
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:25,133
AND THE RESULT OF ALL THIS WAS

610
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,400
THAT THE POPULARITY OF THESE

611
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:28,800
MINISTRIES EXPLODED, FROM AN

612
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:30,600
ESTIMATED 200,000 MEMBERS

613
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,533
A DECADE AGO, TO MORE THAN

614
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,366
A MILLION TODAY.

615
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,433
AND WHILE HCSMs WILL INSIST THEY

616
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,966
MAKE IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT

617
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:39,933
THEY'RE NOT HEALTH INSURANCE,

618
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,433
MANY DO SEEM TO GO OUT OF THEIR

619
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,166
WAY TO MAKE THEMSELVES APPEAR

620
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,200
AS INSURANCE-LIKE AS POSSIBLE.

621
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:47,166
FOR A START, THEY'RE SOMETIMES

622
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:48,133
SOLD THROUGH INSURANCE BROKERS

623
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,833
...ALONGSIDE ACTUAL INSURANCE

624
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,266
PLANS... AND WHILE THE OBAMACARE

625
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,933
MARKETPLACE OFFERS PLANS IN

626
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,966
FOUR "METAL" CATEGORIES:

627
00:15:56,033 --> 00:15:57,100
BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD, AND

628
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,266
PLATINUM.

629
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,600
A COMPANY CALLED ALTRUA OFFERED

630
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:00,866
PLANS IN GOLD, SILVER, BRONZE,

631
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:02,800
AND COPPER, REBRANDING THEM LAST

632
00:16:02,866 --> 00:16:04,366
YEAR TO DIAMOND, EMERALD,

633
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:05,866
SAPPHIRE, AND RUBY.

634
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:07,966
ALTHOUGH IT'S STILL PRETTY CLEAR

635
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:08,966
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THERE

636
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:10,300
...VERY MUCH BLUR THE LINE,

637
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:13,000
WHILE ALSO THROWING SOME UNFAIR

638
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:14,600
SHADE AT RUBY, THE OBJECTIVE

639
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,866
GOAT OF THE CARDINAL GEMS.

640
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:19,633
SHE'S RED, KNOWN FOR HER FLAWS,

641
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,200
AND RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOST

642
00:16:20,266 --> 00:16:20,866
ICONIC SLIPPERS IN THE HISTORY

643
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:23,366
OF CINEMA.

644
00:16:23,433 --> 00:16:23,900
EAT YOUR FUCKING HEARTS OUT,

645
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:25,433
SAPPHIRE AND EMERALD, BECAUSE

646
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,433
YOU COULD LITERALLY NEVER.

647
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,609
BUT WHILE THESE HCSMs MAY HAVE

648
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:30,600
THE OPTICS OF INSURANCE, THERE

649
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,133
ARE SOME VERY IMPORTANT

650
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,666
DIFFERENCES.

651
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:35,566
FOR A START, THEY DON'T HAVE TO

652
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:36,900
ABIDE BY LAWS GOVERNING

653
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:38,666
INSURANCE PRODUCTS, MEANING

654
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:39,933
THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING THEM

655
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,300
FROM PLACING RESTRICTIONS ON

656
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:42,466
COVERAGE FOR PRE-EXISTING

657
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:43,400
CONDITIONS.

658
00:16:43,466 --> 00:16:45,266
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY DO.

659
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,000
AND NOT ONLY THAT... MANY WON'T

660
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:48,900
COVER SERVICES CONSIDERED

661
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,533
"ESSENTIAL" UNDER THE ACA,

662
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,866
LIKE TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE

663
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:53,733
ABUSE, OR MENTAL HEALTH CARE.

664
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,600
IN FACT, ALTRUA EXCLUDES THOSE,

665
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,166
AND ALSO TREATMENT FOR OBESITY

666
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:59,100
OR AUTISM.

667
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,309
AND SAMARITAN'S "CLASSIC" PLAN

668
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,200
HAS A LIST OF NON-QUALIFIED

669
00:17:02,266 --> 00:17:03,433
ITEMS INCLUDING "ROUTINE,

670
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,833
MAINTENANCE, STABILIZED,

671
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,300
PREVENTIVE, AND WELLNESS CARE"

672
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:10,533
...THAT'S EVERYTHING FROM

673
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,333
REGULAR CHECKUPS TO

674
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,833
VACCINATIONS.

675
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,009
AND EVEN FOR ELIGIBLE EXPENSES,

676
00:17:17,033 --> 00:17:17,566
THE MOST THAT CAN BE

677
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:18,733
SHARED FOR A GIVEN NEED IS

678
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,500
$250,000.

679
00:17:19,566 --> 00:17:20,500
WHICH EXPLAINS THEIR FULL NAME,

680
00:17:20,566 --> 00:17:21,366
"SAMARITAN, NOT THE GOOD ONE,

681
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:22,600
THOUGH... JUST A RANDOM

682
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,742
SAMARITAN WHO MIGHT WELL LEAVE

683
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:24,566
YOU TO DIE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN

684
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:25,533
ABANDONED ROAD."

685
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,000
AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN TO

686
00:17:27,066 --> 00:17:27,866
ONE OF THE BIGGEST EXCUSES HCSMs

687
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:29,100
CAN USE TO DENY COVERAGE, AND

688
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,466
THAT'S MORALITY.

689
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:33,233
BECAUSE THAT MEANS YOU CAN BE

690
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,800
DENIED COVERAGE FOR BASICALLY

691
00:17:34,866 --> 00:17:36,066
ANYTHING.

692
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:38,900
THIS IS A PROGRAM OF THE

693
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:40,200
CHRISTIAN CARE MINISTRY AND

694
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:41,533
PEOPLE WHO SMOKE OR SAME-SEX

695
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,366
COUPLES NEED NOT APPLY.

696
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:45,200
THE PROGRAM ALSO WON'T PAY FOR

697
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:46,700
ILLNESSES RELATED TO ALCOHOL,

698
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,566
ABORTION, OR OTHER

699
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:50,366
LIFESTYLE-RELATED CHOICES.

700
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:51,609
I NEED TO KNOW THAT I'M NOT

701
00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:53,866
GONNA BE PAYING FOR SOMEONE ELSE

702
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:55,333
WHO'S DECIDED TO SIT ON THE

703
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,409
COUCH AND EAT BONBONS ALL DAY.

704
00:17:56,433 --> 00:17:58,933
WOW, THAT IS HARSH.

705
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,276
BUT THAT JUDGMENTAL TONE IS VERY

706
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,533
MUCH IN LINE WITH HOW THESE

707
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,466
MINISTRIES OPERATE.

708
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:04,600
DO PEOPLE REALLY DESERVE

709
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,800
HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IF THEY

710
00:18:05,866 --> 00:18:07,433
EAT JUNK FOOD OR DON'T EXERCISE

711
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,800
OR ARE GAY?

712
00:18:08,866 --> 00:18:09,866
JUST FIX IT!

713
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:11,600
EAT A CARROT, GO FOR A RUN,

714
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:12,933
RUB YOUR PENIS OR VAGINA ON

715
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,276
SOMEBODY ELSE'S VAGINA OR PENIS,

716
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,766
RESPECTIVELY.

717
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,433
IT'S REALLY NOT DIFFICULT!

718
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,066
AND THIS IS A PATTERN ACROSS

719
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:19,866
HCSMs.

720
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,133
LIBERTY'S MATERIALS SAY THAT

721
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,242
AN APPLICANT MUST COMPLY WITH

722
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:24,166
A CHRISTIAN LIFESTYLE.

723
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:25,313
AND AMONG THE EXCLUSIONS ON

724
00:18:25,366 --> 00:18:27,200
SAMARITAN'S "CLASSIC" PROGRAM,

725
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:28,276
YOU'LL FIND THAT THEY MIGHT PAY

726
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,666
FOR TREATMENT FOR AN STD,

727
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:32,833
BUT NOT IF IT WAS CONTRACTED BY

728
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,300
SEX OUTSIDE OF MARRIAGE, AND

729
00:18:34,366 --> 00:18:35,966
THAT THE MEMBER HAS TO EXPLAIN

730
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:37,366
HOW THE DISEASE WAS CONTRACTED.

731
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:39,233
PRESUMABLY, THE HOTTER THE

732
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,433
STORY, THE MORE MONEY YOU GET

733
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,400
FOR OINTMENTS.

734
00:18:44,466 --> 00:18:45,509
VANILLA MISSIONARY SHIT ISN'T

735
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:46,700
GOING TO GET COVERED, BUD.

736
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:47,876
YOU BETTER HAVE GOTTEN GONORRHEA

737
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,942
FROM AN EARLOBE IF YOU WANT

738
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:49,900
SAMARITAN'S ATTENTION.

739
00:18:49,966 --> 00:18:51,100
BUT SWEEPING MORAL JUDGMENT

740
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:51,900
ISN'T THE ONLY LEEWAY THESE

741
00:18:51,966 --> 00:18:53,733
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE.

742
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,133
BECAUSE THEY'RE VOLUNTARY

743
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,800
ASSOCIATIONS, YOU HAVE NO

744
00:18:56,866 --> 00:18:57,733
GUARANTEE THAT YOUR BILLS

745
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,966
WILL GET PAID.

746
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:00,366
ALTHOUGH, TO HEAR A FOUNDER OF

747
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:03,733
LIBERTY HEALTHSHARE TELL IT,

748
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,900
YOU'VE REALLY GOT NOTHING TO

749
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:07,033
WORRY ABOUT THERE.

750
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:07,800
JUST LISTEN TO HIM REASSURE

751
00:19:07,866 --> 00:19:08,966
PEOPLE IN A VIDEO ON THEIR

752
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:09,566
WEBSITE TITLED, "WILL MY BILLS

753
00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:10,633
BE PAID?"

754
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,800
WE'VE HAD A SUCCESSFUL

755
00:19:11,866 --> 00:19:14,166
HISTORY OF SHARING MEDICAL BILLS

756
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:15,533
100%, FOR EVERY ELIGIBLE NEED

757
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,033
EVER SUBMITTED.

758
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,700
SO IT DOESN'T DEPEND UPON

759
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:21,066
A WRITTEN CONTRACT WHERE WE CAN

760
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:23,666
SUE EACH OTHER IF SOMEONE

761
00:19:23,733 --> 00:19:25,166
DOESN'T SEND THEIR SHARE AMOUNT.

762
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:27,300
IT'S REALLY A CONTRACT WRITTEN

763
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,466
ON OUR HEARTS.

764
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:30,966
OH, RIGHT, IT'S A

765
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:32,933
CONTRACT WRITTEN ON YOUR HEARTS.

766
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,600
FIGURATIVELY, OF COURSE.

767
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:35,809
BECAUSE LITERALLY, IT'S NOT A

768
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,400
CONTRACT.

769
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:39,233
AND AS FOR HIS CLAIM THERE THAT

770
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,833
LIBERTY SUCCESSFULLY SHARED

771
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,233
100% OF MEDICAL BILLS "FOR EVERY

772
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:43,900
ELIGIBLE NEED"... GIVEN,

773
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:45,333
AS WE'VE DISCUSSED, THEY CAN

774
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,266
DEEM ANY NEED INELIGIBLE FOR

775
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,700
ANY REASON, THAT PHRASE IS

776
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:51,000
ESSENTIALLY AS MEANINGLESS AS

777
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,366
THEIR CARDIAC NON-CONTRACT.

778
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:53,766
AND ON TOP OF ALL THIS, THERE'S

779
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,266
THE PRACTICAL MATTER OF HOW

780
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,000
EXACTLY YOU PAY FOR YOUR CARE

781
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:57,900
AS A MEMBER.

782
00:19:57,966 --> 00:19:59,166
THE HCSM PROCESS TYPICALLY IS,

783
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,276
YOU'RE TOLD TO PRESENT YOURSELF

784
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,900
AS UNINSURED.

785
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:03,500
THEN, WHEN YOU GET YOUR BILL,

786
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:05,300
THE EXPECTATION IS THAT YOU

787
00:20:05,366 --> 00:20:06,509
BARGAIN DOWN THE COST OF YOUR

788
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:08,800
CARE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN,

789
00:20:08,866 --> 00:20:11,533
THEN PAY THE BILL YOURSELF,

790
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,066
THEN SUBMIT YOUR BILLS TO

791
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:13,800
THE MINISTRY FOR REIMBURSEMENT.

792
00:20:13,866 --> 00:20:15,566
AND IF YOU'VE EVER WAITED FOR

793
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:16,900
YOUR FRIENDS TO VENMO YOU AFTER

794
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,700
PAYING FOR DINNER, YOU KNOW THAT

795
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:20,133
THE REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS CAN GO

796
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
VERY WRONG.

797
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:23,600
PARTICIPANTS IN LIBERTY...

798
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:24,466
YOU KNOW, THE ONE WITH THE

799
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:28,000
"HEART CONTRACT"... HAVE FOUND

800
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:28,733
PAYMENTS CAN BE SLOW TO

801
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,533
NONEXISTENT.

802
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,000
IN THE PAST THREE YEARS,

803
00:20:31,066 --> 00:20:31,666
TIFFANY SCHULTZ WITH THE

804
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:32,842
WISCONSIN BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU

805
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:34,566
SAYS THE BBB HAS TAKEN MORE THAN

806
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,000
500 COMPLAINTS ABOUT LIBERTY

807
00:20:36,066 --> 00:20:36,833
HEALTHSHARE, MANY WITH SIMILAR

808
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,166
STORIES.

809
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:39,700
ONE CLAIMING $90,000 IN

810
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:41,066
OUTSTANDING IN MEDICAL BILLS

811
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:42,833
THAT WERE PRE-APPROVED.

812
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,100
EITHER THE CONSUMER IS OUT

813
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,466
THE MONEY AND HASN'T BEEN

814
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:47,233
REIMBURSED, OR THEY'RE ENDING UP

815
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,900
GOING TO COLLECTIONS.

816
00:20:48,966 --> 00:20:51,400
THAT'S NOT GREAT.

817
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:52,933
AND WHILE LIBERTY CLAIMS THAT

818
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,366
2019 WAS A PARTICULARLY

819
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:55,866
DIFFICULT YEAR, AND THAT THEY'RE

820
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:57,466
PROUD OF IMPROVEMENTS THEY'VE

821
00:20:57,533 --> 00:20:59,066
MADE SINCE THEN, IT'S WORTH

822
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,066
NOTING THAT LIBERTY'S MEMBERS

823
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,233
STILL SEEM PRETTY ACTIVE ON

824
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,766
THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU

825
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,166
WEBSITE, WHERE THEY'VE LOGGED

826
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:07,100
304 COMPLAINTS IN THE LAST

827
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,366
12 MONTHS, WHICH IS A LOT,

828
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,800
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER

829
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:11,500
THAT CIGNA... A MASSIVE INSURER

830
00:21:11,566 --> 00:21:13,033
...HAS JUST HALF THAT AMOUNT,

831
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,200
WHILE HAVING 15 TIMES

832
00:21:14,266 --> 00:21:15,666
THE MEMBERS.

833
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:21,100
AND IMAGINE HAVING MORE PEOPLE

834
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,166
COMPLAIN ABOUT YOU THAN ABOUT

835
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:25,233
CIGNA, A COMPANY WHOSE LOGO IS A

836
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,476
CARTOON MAN STANDING IN A FIELD

837
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,933
AS HIS HEAD EXPLODES FROM

838
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,733
DEALING WITH THEIR CUSTOMER

839
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:29,966
SERVICE.

840
00:21:30,033 --> 00:21:30,866
AND UNFORTUNATELY, IN MOST

841
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:31,866
STATES, A COMPLAINT TO THE

842
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:33,000
BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU IS

843
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:33,633
BASICALLY ALL THE RECOURSE

844
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,800
YOU HAVE.

845
00:21:34,866 --> 00:21:36,266
AND THESE MINISTRIES HAVE WORKED

846
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,200
VERY HARD TO KEEP ACCOUNTABILITY

847
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:39,533
AT BAY, SUCCESSFULLY LOBBYING

848
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,800
FOR SO-CALLED "SAFE HARBOR LAWS"

849
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:45,033
IN MORE THAN 30 STATES, ENSURING

850
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,600
THEY CAN OPERATE SAFELY OUTSIDE

851
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,266
OF INSURANCE REGULATIONS.

852
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,133
AND TO SEE JUST HOW MUCH YOU CAN

853
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
GET AWAY WITH, IT'S WORTH

854
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:52,900
LOOKING AT A COMPANY CALLED

855
00:21:52,966 --> 00:21:54,500
ALIERA, WHICH HAS BEEN HEAVILY

856
00:21:54,566 --> 00:21:55,766
INVOLVED WITH A NUMBER OF

857
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,200
HEALTH-SHARING MINISTRIES OVER

858
00:21:58,266 --> 00:22:00,200
THE YEARS... FIRST, ONE CALLED

859
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:01,376
UNITY, THEN ONE CALLED TRINITY,

860
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,466
WHICH NOW GOES BY SHARITY.

861
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:04,773
ALTHOUGH THOSE NAMES SOUND LESS

862
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,966
LIKE HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS

863
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:08,109
AND MORE LIKE CHARACTERS IN A

864
00:22:08,133 --> 00:22:09,633
RELIGIOUS-THEMED CAPTAIN PLANET

865
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,300
KNOCKOFF... WHEN THEIR POWERS

866
00:22:11,366 --> 00:22:12,233
COMBINE, THEY GET CANCELED AFTER

867
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,933
TWO EPISODES.

868
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,233
ALIERA PRESENTS ITSELF AS MERELY

869
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,466
AN ADMINISTRATOR FOR HCSMs,

870
00:22:19,533 --> 00:22:22,366
BUT IT'S INTRICATELY CONNECTED

871
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:27,000
TO THE ONES IT WORKS WITH, AND

872
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:28,100
VERY MUCH BY DESIGN.

873
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,633
JUST SIX WEEKS AFTER TRINITY WAS

874
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,842
INCORPORATED, IT SIGNED A DEAL

875
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:31,400
WITH ALIERA STIPULATING THAT

876
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:32,542
ALIERA WOULD HAVE EXCLUSIVE

877
00:22:32,566 --> 00:22:33,500
OWNERSHIP RIGHTS TO THE

878
00:22:33,566 --> 00:22:34,666
MEMBERSHIP ROSTER, AND WAS

879
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:36,466
THE SOLE PARTY DEVELOPING AND

880
00:22:36,533 --> 00:22:37,800
MARKETING THE PLANS INCLUDING

881
00:22:37,866 --> 00:22:39,600
THE HCSM COMPONENT.

882
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:42,000
SO ALIERA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH

883
00:22:42,066 --> 00:22:43,176
TRINITY IS BASICALLY THIS GUY'S

884
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,066
RELATIONSHIP TO HIS ALIEN

885
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:45,433
COSTUME.

886
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,966
HE CAN CLAIM THAT HE ISN'T

887
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:48,866
TECHNICALLY THE COSTUME,

888
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:50,100
AND THAT'S TRUE.

889
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,342
BUT THE COSTUME DOESN'T REALLY

890
00:22:51,366 --> 00:22:53,233
DO ANYTHING WITHOUT HIM.

891
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,466
AND CUSTOMERS IN MULTIPLE STATES

892
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:56,966
HAVE CLAIMED THAT ALIERA AND ITS

893
00:22:57,033 --> 00:22:58,466
MINISTRIES HAVE BEEN RUTHLESS

894
00:22:58,533 --> 00:22:59,966
IN DENYING COVERAGE, WIELDING

895
00:23:00,033 --> 00:23:01,900
"MORALITY CLAUSES" HARD.

896
00:23:01,966 --> 00:23:03,433
WHEN ONE MEMBER WAS ATTACKED AND

897
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,666
KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS OUTSIDE A

898
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:06,700
BAR AND TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL

899
00:23:06,766 --> 00:23:08,466
WITH SERIOUS INJURIES, INCLUDING

900
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:10,166
A SKULL FRACTURE, CERVICAL SPINE

901
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:12,000
FRACTURE, AND INTERCRANIAL

902
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:14,033
BLEEDING, ALIERA DENIED HER

903
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,866
CLAIMS, STATING HER INJURIES

904
00:23:15,933 --> 00:23:17,366
WERE "SELF-INFLICTED," AND

905
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:18,700
CITING THEIR GUIDELINES,

906
00:23:18,766 --> 00:23:19,842
INCLUDING THE LINE, "FOLLOW

907
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:22,000
SPIRITUAL TEACHINGS ON THE USE

908
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:26,866
OR ABUSE OF ALCOHOL" WHICH IS,

909
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:29,266
I'M PRETTY SURE IS THE

910
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,333
BENEVOLENT ADVICE

911
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,866
JESUS WOULD HAVE GIVEN

912
00:23:33,933 --> 00:23:34,600
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

913
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:35,566
AND INCREDIBLY, THAT'S NOT EVEN

914
00:23:35,633 --> 00:23:36,400
THE WORST STORY OF A REJECTED

915
00:23:36,466 --> 00:23:39,200
CLAIM INVOLVING ALIERA.

916
00:23:39,266 --> 00:23:40,200
10-YEAR-OLD LOLA GRACE SEGARS

917
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:41,346
IS HEALTHY JUST FOUR MONTHS

918
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
AFTER BRAIN SURGERY.

919
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:43,600
ON SEPTEMBER 11TH, SHE WAS

920
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:44,826
RUSHED FROM THE LOCAL E.R. IN

921
00:23:44,866 --> 00:23:45,400
GREENE COUNTY BY AMBULANCE TO

922
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:45,866
CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE

923
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:47,166
SCOTTISH RITE, WHERE DOCTORS

924
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:47,666
REMOVED A SOFTBALL-SIZED

925
00:23:47,733 --> 00:23:48,400
BRAIN TUMOR.

926
00:23:48,466 --> 00:23:49,400
IT WAS JUST AMAZING,

927
00:23:49,466 --> 00:23:50,866
THE CARE.

928
00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:52,200
BUT LAST WEEK CAME THE BILL

929
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:53,066
FROM THEIR HEALTH PLAN, ALIERA

930
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:55,400
COMPANIES.

931
00:23:55,466 --> 00:23:58,600
$325,624.

932
00:23:58,666 --> 00:23:59,809
ALIERA SAYS CHILDREN'S IS OUT

933
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,766
OF NETWORK AND WON'T PAY THE

934
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:02,866
$325,000 BILL.

935
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:04,466
WE HAD A LIFE-THREATENING

936
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:05,666
EMERGENCY.

937
00:24:05,733 --> 00:24:09,133
THEY FAILED US AND HER.

938
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,100
HOLY SHIT.

939
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:13,333
THEY WERE DENIED REIMBURSEMENT

940
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,066
FOR A CHILD WHO HAD

941
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:16,500
A SOFTBALL-SIZED TUMOR REMOVED

942
00:24:16,566 --> 00:24:18,800
FROM HER BRAIN, WHICH IS,

943
00:24:18,866 --> 00:24:19,400
INCIDENTALLY, EXACTLY THE KIND

944
00:24:19,466 --> 00:24:20,100
OF IMMORAL BEHAVIOR I'D EXPECT

945
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,600
SHARING MINISTRIES TO CLASSIFY

946
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:24,833
AS FUCKING DISQUALIFYING.

947
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,333
NOW, ALIERA CLAIMS THAT FAMILY'S

948
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,609
ISSUES WERE ULTIMATELY RESOLVED,

949
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:28,900
BUT ONLY AFTER THAT STORY

950
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:30,500
WAS FEATURED ON THE NEWS.

951
00:24:30,566 --> 00:24:32,566
AND IT SHOWS JUST HOW LITTLE

952
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:34,400
RECOURSE YOU HAVE, THAT IF YOU

953
00:24:34,466 --> 00:24:36,366
DON'T HAVE A CHILD YOU CAN GET

954
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,033
ON TV TO SHAME THE COMPANY INTO

955
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,866
ACTION, YOU COULD BE SHIT OUT OF

956
00:24:38,933 --> 00:24:40,733
LUCK.

957
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,766
AND LOOK, TRADITIONAL INSURANCE

958
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:44,466
COMPANIES ALSO HAVE THEIR SHARE

959
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:45,100
OF HORROR STORIES WHEN IT COMES

960
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:46,200
TO DENIAL OF COVERAGE.

961
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:48,133
BUT THERE ARE IMPORTANT

962
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,309
DIFFERENCES HERE... NOT JUST IN

963
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:50,900
THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION YOU HAVE

964
00:24:50,966 --> 00:24:51,666
WHEN THAT HAPPENS, BUT IN THE

965
00:24:51,733 --> 00:24:52,500
DEGREE OF FINANCIAL

966
00:24:52,566 --> 00:24:54,933
ACCOUNTABILITY.

967
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,566
BECAUSE WHILE THE ACA REQUIRES

968
00:24:56,633 --> 00:24:58,400
ACTUAL HEALTH INSURERS TO SPEND

969
00:24:58,466 --> 00:25:00,866
NO MORE THAN 20% OF MONEY ON

970
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:02,800
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, THEREFORE

971
00:25:02,866 --> 00:25:04,233
LEAVING AT LEAST 80% FOR CARE,

972
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,933
THERE'S NO SUCH REQUIREMENT FOR

973
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,966
HCSMs.

974
00:25:08,033 --> 00:25:09,273
AND YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL WHERE

975
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:11,333
THIS IS GOING.

976
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,333
BECAUSE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE

977
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,733
FOUND THAT OUT OF EVERY $100

978
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,333
A TRINITY MEMBER PAID IN

979
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,466
PREMIUMS, ONLY $16 WENT TOWARDS

980
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:20,533
PAYING MEDICAL EXPENSES,

981
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,466
WITH THE REST BEING KICKED UP TO

982
00:25:21,533 --> 00:25:23,566
ALIERA.

983
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:25,533
AND PAYING OUT 16% OF THE MONEY

984
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,066
YOU TAKE IN FOR COVERAGE IS

985
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:27,933
A LOT DIFFERENT THAN PAYING OUT

986
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,466
80.

987
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:30,966
BECAUSE 80% MAKES YOU THINK,

988
00:25:31,033 --> 00:25:32,533
"WAIT, WHY EXACTLY DO WE HAVE

989
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,866
INSURANCE COMPANIES?"

990
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:35,633
WHEREAS 16 MAKES YOU THINK,

991
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,933
"IS A CRIME HAPPENING TO ME

992
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,266
RIGHT NOW, AND IF SO, WHY DOES

993
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:40,233
EVERYONE SEEM OKAY WITH IT?"

994
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,300
AND WHEN A LOCAL NEWS REPORTER

995
00:25:43,366 --> 00:25:43,833
CAUGHT UP WITH THE HEAD OF

996
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,133
ALIERA TO ASK HER ABOUT ITS

997
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,066
RELUCTANCE TO PAY OUT CLAIMS,

998
00:25:48,133 --> 00:25:48,966
HER RESPONSE WAS NOT

999
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:50,233
PARTICULARLY REASSURING.

1000
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,233
DO YOU HAVE ANY APOLOGIES

1001
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,309
TO THE MEMBERS WHO BELIEVE THEIR

1002
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:55,033
CLAIMS OUGHT TO BE PAID AND

1003
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,800
THEY'RE NOT PAID?

1004
00:25:55,866 --> 00:25:56,333
OH, MY GOODNESS.

1005
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,409
WE'RE NOT... WE'RE NOT A HEALTH

1006
00:25:57,433 --> 00:25:58,266
...WE'RE NOT A

1007
00:25:58,333 --> 00:25:59,376
HEALTH CARE-SHARING MINISTRY,

1008
00:25:59,400 --> 00:25:59,766
MR. STRICKLAND.

1009
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:00,533
WE ONLY ADMINISTER ON BEHALF

1010
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,400
OF THE... OF THE MINISTRIES.

1011
00:26:01,466 --> 00:26:02,666
I CAN'T HELP YOU ANY FURTHER.

1012
00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:04,500
I NEED TO GET OUT OF TOWN.

1013
00:26:04,566 --> 00:26:06,766
OKAY, IT'S NEVER A

1014
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:07,733
GOOD SIGN WHEN A CEO HAS TO END

1015
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,000
AN INTERVIEW LIKE THAT.

1016
00:26:09,066 --> 00:26:10,266
"AS I'VE SAID BEFORE, OUR

1017
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,476
COMPANY HAS NEVER DONE ANYTHING

1018
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,200
ILLEGAL.

1019
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:14,233
NOW HAVE YOU SEEN A MAN IN

1020
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,000
A BLUE FEDORA?

1021
00:26:15,066 --> 00:26:15,900
HE'S SUPPOSED TO GIVE ME A NEW

1022
00:26:15,966 --> 00:26:16,976
IDENTITY AS I GET PULLED INTO

1023
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,800
A HELICOPTER THAT'S ALREADY

1024
00:26:17,866 --> 00:26:18,100
TAKING OFF.

1025
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:19,766
TELL MY DAUGHTER I LOVED HER AND

1026
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:20,400
MY HUSBAND I DIDN'T!

1027
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:22,966
I'M OUT!"

1028
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:24,273
NOW I SHOULD SAY, OTHER SHARING

1029
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,566
MINISTRIES HAVE TRIED TO

1030
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:26,809
DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM ALIERA,

1031
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:28,066
CLAIMING THAT, "THIS SORT OF

1032
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:29,866
DECEPTION IS NOT PART OF

1033
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:31,966
LEGITIMATE, AUTHENTIC HEALTH

1034
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:32,500
CARE SHARING MINISTRIES."

1035
00:26:32,566 --> 00:26:33,676
AND ALIERA IS DEFINITELY BAD.

1036
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,000
BUT ONE THING INSURANCE

1037
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:36,566
COMMISSIONERS HAVE REPEATEDLY

1038
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:38,100
TOLD US IN RESEARCHING THIS

1039
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:39,633
PIECE IS HOW LITTLE TRANSPARENCY

1040
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,133
THERE IS INTO HOW THESE

1041
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,066
MINISTRIES OPERATE, AND JUST HOW

1042
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:45,033
WARY THEY THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE

1043
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,000
OF ALL OF THEM.

1044
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:49,600
AND LOOK, BROADLY, WE HAVE TO

1045
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:51,400
DO MORE IN THIS COUNTRY TO

1046
00:26:51,466 --> 00:26:52,833
REDUCE THE COST OF HEALTH CARE

1047
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,533
...PERSONALLY, I'D ARGUE

1048
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,100
SWITCHING TO A SINGLE-PAYER

1049
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:55,933
SYSTEM WOULD REMOVE A LOT OF

1050
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,133
THESE PROBLEMS INSTANTLY,

1051
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:57,766
BUT THAT CLEARLY ISN'T HAPPENING

1052
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:59,200
ANYTIME SOON.

1053
00:26:59,266 --> 00:27:01,166
SO IN THE MEANTIME, I DO GET

1054
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:02,366
THE APPEAL OF LOWER-COST

1055
00:27:02,433 --> 00:27:04,400
HEALTH INSURANCE.

1056
00:27:04,466 --> 00:27:06,833
THE PROBLEM IS, THIS ISN'T THAT.

1057
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,633
IT'S NOT INSURANCE AT ALL.

1058
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,500
AND STATES NEED, AT THE VERY

1059
00:27:10,566 --> 00:27:13,066
LEAST, TO PASS LAWS TO MAKE SURE

1060
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:15,166
PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GETTING

1061
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:16,533
INTO WITH HCSMs, AND TO FORCE

1062
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,266
THEM TO ALLOCATE FUNDS PROPERLY.

1063
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,100
THE PROBLEM IS, SOME ARE GOING

1064
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:21,566
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

1065
00:27:21,633 --> 00:27:23,333
TAKE FLORIDA.

1066
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,300
IN 2018, AFTER INTENSE LOBBYING,

1067
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:27,633
IT LOOSENED ITS RESTRICTIONS ON

1068
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,709
HCSMs EVEN FURTHER, GOING FROM

1069
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:30,233
REQUIRING PARTICIPANTS BE

1070
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,533
"MEMBERS OF THE SAME RELIGION,"

1071
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,566
TO MERELY REQUIRING THEY

1072
00:27:34,633 --> 00:27:35,900
"SHARE A COMMON SET OF ETHICAL

1073
00:27:35,966 --> 00:27:37,266
OR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS."

1074
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:38,233
AND THAT COULD BE BASICALLY

1075
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,500
ANYTHING.

1076
00:27:40,566 --> 00:27:42,366
AT THIS POINT, THE BAR TO ENTRY

1077
00:27:42,433 --> 00:27:44,166
IS SO LOW, JUST ABOUT ANYONE CAN

1078
00:27:44,233 --> 00:27:46,733
BECOME AN HCSM.

1079
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,333
AND THE REASON I KNOW THAT IS,

1080
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,966
THIS ANYONE DID.

1081
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:52,333
YOU MAY REMEMBER, BACK IN 2015,

1082
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,033
WE FOUNDED A CHURCH, OUR LADY

1083
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,533
OF PERPETUAL EXEMPTION, TO

1084
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,709
DEMONSTRATE THAT TAX EXEMPTIONS

1085
00:27:56,733 --> 00:27:57,966
FOR CHURCHES ENABLED SOME OF

1086
00:27:58,033 --> 00:28:00,033
THEM TO DO TERRIBLE THINGS.

1087
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,266
WELL, JUST THREE MONTHS AGO,

1088
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,200
WE OFFICIALLY FOUNDED A SPINOFF

1089
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:04,066
CHURCH CALLED "OUR LADY OF

1090
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:05,766
PERPETUAL HEALTH."

1091
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:06,976
AND WE FOUNDED IT... WHERE ELSE?

1092
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,733
...BUT FLORIDA.

1093
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,100
I'M HAPPY TO TELL YOU, THAT

1094
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:11,800
CHURCH NOW HAS ITS OWN HEALTH

1095
00:28:11,866 --> 00:28:12,533
CARE SHARING MINISTRY,

1096
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,333
"JOHNNYCARE."

1097
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,476
AND THE WHOLE THING WAS SCARILY

1098
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,433
EASY TO DO.

1099
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,566
SO, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,

1100
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:21,766
PLEASE JOIN ME, MY MOST BLESSED

1101
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:25,400
CONGREGANTS, AT CHURCH.

1102
00:28:25,466 --> 00:28:26,933
AND YOU KNOW, I COULDN'T RUN

1103
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,800
AN ORGANIZATION AS IMPORTANT

1104
00:28:28,866 --> 00:28:29,766
AS THIS MINISTRY ALL BY MYSELF.

1105
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,333
SO PLEASE WELCOME, LIVE FROM

1106
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,000
JOHNNYCARE HEADQUARTERS IN SUNNY

1107
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:34,533
FLORIDA, THE FELICITY HUFFMAN TO

1108
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,609
MY WILLIAM H. MACY, MY DEAR WIFE

1109
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:42,000

1110
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:44,000
PRAISE BE TO YOU, MY WANDA.

1111
00:28:44,066 --> 00:28:47,266
PRAISE BE TO YOU, MY JOHN,

1112
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:49,566
AND PRAISE BE TO THE BLESSED

1113
00:28:49,633 --> 00:28:50,766
STATE WHERE MINIMALLY

1114
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:51,666
REGULATED INSURANCE KNOCKOFFS GO

1115
00:28:51,733 --> 00:28:52,900
TO BE BORN.

1116
00:28:52,966 --> 00:28:56,766
AND RETIRED PEOPLE GO TO DIE.

1117
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:59,166
AMEN TO THAT.

1118
00:28:59,233 --> 00:29:01,100
I HAVE HEARD THE WORD OF THE

1119
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:01,433
LORD, MY JOHN.

1120
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,000
AND WHAT DID IT SAY,

1121
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:06,666
MY WANDA?

1122
00:29:06,733 --> 00:29:10,500
IT SAID THOU MUST FREE ITSELF

1123
00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:11,709
FROM THE OVERREACHING GRASP OF

1124
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:13,200
GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE.

1125
00:29:13,266 --> 00:29:14,266
STICK IT TO THEM!

1126
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:16,400
STICK IT TO THEM!

1127
00:29:16,466 --> 00:29:18,033
NOW WANDA, WE ARE RUNNING THE

1128
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,400
MINISTRY AS A CHURCH EVEN THOUGH

1129
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,900
IN FLORIDA, WE ACTUALLY DON'T

1130
00:29:20,966 --> 00:29:22,500
HAVE TO BE.

1131
00:29:22,566 --> 00:29:23,833
AMEN, PRAISE FLORIDA.

1132
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,166
BUT WE DO NEED TO

1133
00:29:25,233 --> 00:29:27,100
FILL THE REQUIREMENT THAT OUR

1134
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:27,933
MINISTRY PROVIDE FOR THE

1135
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,300
FINANCIAL OR MEDICAL NEEDS OF

1136
00:29:30,366 --> 00:29:31,066
PARTICIPANTS FROM CONTRIBUTIONS

1137
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:31,566
FROM OTHER PARTICIPANTS.

1138
00:29:31,633 --> 00:29:34,000
THE GOOD NEWS IS, WE HAVE DONE

1139
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:35,433
THAT THROUGH OUR SPECIAL

1140
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,533
JOHNNYCARE FIRST AID KIT

1141
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,766
CONTAINING NOT ONE, NOT TWO, BUT

1142
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:41,133
THREE BAND-AIDS.

1143
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,376
IT SCREAMS THE CHEAPEST OPTION

1144
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,433
THAT WE COULD FIND.

1145
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,000
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, MY WANDA?

1146
00:29:46,066 --> 00:29:47,833
WHAT, MY JOHN?

1147
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,100
IT WAS.

1148
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:52,033
WHY THREE BAND-AIDS?

1149
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,900
WE KNOW THAT, ALAS, SOMETIMES,

1150
00:29:53,966 --> 00:29:54,566
ACCIDENTS HAPPEN.

1151
00:29:54,633 --> 00:29:56,166
BUT IF THEY HAPPEN MORE THAN

1152
00:29:56,233 --> 00:29:58,700
THREE TIMES, IT JUST STOPS BEING

1153
00:29:58,766 --> 00:29:59,266
OUR PROBLEM.

1154
00:29:59,333 --> 00:29:59,933
AND LET ME BE CLEAR,

1155
00:30:00,033 --> 00:30:01,733
WHEN YOU SIGN UP FOR MEMBERSHIP,

1156
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,200
YOU ARE NOT PAYING FOR YOUR OWN

1157
00:30:03,266 --> 00:30:03,900
FIRST AID KIT.

1158
00:30:03,966 --> 00:30:05,100
YOU ARE PAYING FOR SOMEONE

1159
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:07,100
ELSE'S, AND THEY ARE PAYING FOR

1160
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:07,400
YOURS.

1161
00:30:07,466 --> 00:30:09,433
AND THAT GIVES YOU FREEDOM

1162
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,666
FROM INSURANCE!

1163
00:30:11,733 --> 00:30:12,366
AND US FREEDOM FROM

1164
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:12,733
RESPONSIBILITY.

1165
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,133
AND BEYOND THAT, IT'S

1166
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,133
A VERY SIMPLE SYSTEM.

1167
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,100
IF YOU NEED MEDICAL CARE, YOU GO

1168
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:18,600
TO THE DOCTOR, YOU RECEIVE IT,

1169
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:19,909
YOU REQUEST A BILL, AND THEN YOU

1170
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:22,766
PAY THAT BILL ON YOUR OWN.

1171
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:24,100
LEAVE US OUT OF IT.

1172
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,400
OH, YEAH, BECAUSE IF

1173
00:30:25,433 --> 00:30:27,333
YOU SUBMIT THAT BILL TO US, WE

1174
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,166
ARE GOING TO REJECT IT.

1175
00:30:28,233 --> 00:30:31,166
VERNON HIS LIPS TO GOD'S

1176
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:32,566
BIGGER LIPS IN THE SKY!

1177
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:33,433
TESTIFY!

1178
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,700
EITHER BECAUSE YOU ENGAGE IN

1179
00:30:35,766 --> 00:30:39,300
THIS AND OF BEYOND THE BONDS OF

1180
00:30:39,366 --> 00:30:39,600
MATRIMONY...

1181
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:42,533
YOU WHORING.

1182
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,033
OR YOU SPENT THE DAY

1183
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:50,800
SITTING ON THE COUCH EATING

1184
00:30:50,866 --> 00:30:52,266
BONBONS >> OR MASTUBATED EVER.

1185
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:53,900
NO CONTRACTS EVER,

1186
00:30:53,966 --> 00:30:56,366
EXCEPT FOR THE ONES THAT ARE IN

1187
00:30:56,433 --> 00:30:56,666
OUR HEARTS.

1188
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,400
NOW YOU CAN BECOME A MEMBER OF

1189
00:30:59,466 --> 00:31:01,866
OUR JOHNNYCARE MINISTRY FOR JUST

1190
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:03,633
$1.99, AND WE ARE LIMITING

1191

MEMBERSHIP TO 5,000 OF YOU IN

1192
00:31:05,433 --> 00:31:06,833
FLORIDA, NOT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO,

1193
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,500
BUT BECAUSE THAT IS THE NUMBER

1194
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:09,933
OF FIRST AID KIT THAT WE BOUGHT.

1195
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,733
SO GO TO FREEDOM FROM

1196
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,333
HEALTH CARE.ORG AND SEE IF YOU

1197
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,933
QUALIFY TO SEND US MONEY AND GET

1198
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,766
ALMOST NOTHING IN RETURN.

1199
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,133
IS CLOSE TO NOTHING AS WE

1200
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,333
COULD GET AWAY WITH.

1201
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,500
AND TO BE CLEAR, WE

1202
00:31:21,566 --> 00:31:22,642
SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET WITH

1203
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:25,200
ANY OF THIS!
