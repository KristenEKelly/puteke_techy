LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,240
Season IV
Episode 12

3
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,840
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,880
Thank you for joining us, we begin
with the biggest story of the week,

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,680
which once again,
concerned President Trump,

6
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,800
two words that continue
to sound revolting together,

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,280
like viscous discharge
or moist stockings.

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,400
The president made news
with a startling decision.

9
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:59,600
President Trump fired the embattled
FBI director James Comey.

10
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,000
Surprise, everyone !
Remember normal weeks ?

11
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,320
'Cause I don't. I don't
remember what they felt like.

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,160
Everything about Comey's
firing was unusual,

13
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,280
from the fact that he himself
found out about it from TV,

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,960
to the termination letter,
which was weird.

15
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,800
Not just because it featured
Trump's signature,

16
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,280
which looks like a heart rate
monitor of a hamster on meth.

17
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,920
It looks more like that
than it looks like his name.

18
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,440
But it was weird
because of this.

19
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,240
Trump firing Comey
in a bizarre letter.

20
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,960
While I appreciate you informing me
on three separate occasions

21
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,840
that I am not under investigation,
I nevertheless concur

22
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,560
with the judgment
of the Department of Justice

23
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,560
that you are not able
to effectively lead the bureau.

24
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,520
It is inherently suspicious to
put words in Comey's mouth

25
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,120
as you kick him out the door.

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,960
That is the equivalent
of a breakup text reading,

27
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,680
while I appreciate you informing me
on three separate occasions

28
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,600
that I was the most enthusiastic
and intuitive lover you ever had,

29
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,480
I nevertheless must terminate
your position as my girlfriend.

30
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,200
Eggplant Emoji.

31
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,120
And it kept going, because
the White House spent the week

32
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,160
emitting a series
of confusing explanations

33
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,880
claiming that Trump was following
the recommendation of Rod Rosenstein,

34
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,400
who had barely been
in office two weeks,

35
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,480
and that he was acting on
behalf of a demoralized FBI,

36
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,120
neither of which seemed
entirely plausible.

37
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,480
Trump blew up the narrative
when he sat down with Lester Holt

38
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,960
and undid two days of damage
control in a few sentences.

39
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,960
You met with the Deputy Attorney
General Rob Rosenstein.

40
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,920
- Did you ask for a recommendation ?
- I was going to fire Comey...

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,840
- You have made the decision ?
- I was going to fire Comey.

42
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,600
Trump is so desperate
to appear dominant,

43
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,720
he will rush to take the credit for
anything, no matter how bad it is.

44
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,200
If you wanted him to confess to murder,
all a lawyer would have to say is:

45
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,360
Your Honor, the killer could not
have been Donald Trump.

46
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,360
It must have been someone
much stronger and smarter,

47
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,120
with a much hotter daughter.

48
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,200
And before they finished that sentence,
Trump would be yelling I did it !

49
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,320
It was me ! Lock me up !

50
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,400
Trump didn't just clarify
who advised him to fire Comey,

51
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,640
and quick recap:
it was a mirror,

52
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,680
he also indicated
one reason why he did it.

53
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,560
When I decided to just do it,
I said to myself,

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,520
this Russia thing with Trump
and Russia is a made up story,

55
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,960
it's an excuse by the Democrats
for having lost an election

56
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,560
that they should have won.

57
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,960
What are you doing ?

58
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,600
I was thinking of the Russia
investigation when I fired Comey

59
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,840
is the one thing that you are
not supposed to say out loud.

60
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,160
It is the response that
makes you ask three questions.

61
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,400
One: can he really be this stupid ?

62
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,040
Two: does he really think
we as a country are this stupid ?

63
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,320
Three: are we as a country
this stupid ?

64
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,080
It's possible the answers
to all three questions are yes !

65
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,360
Lester Holt asked Trump
about his claim

66
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,800
that Comey had exonerated him
three times.

67
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,880
He said it once at dinner and
twice during phone calls.

68
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,200
Did you call him ?

69
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,320
In one case I called him,
in one case he called me.

70
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,720
Did you ask:
"Am I under investigation ?"

71
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,920
Yes. I said:

72
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,000
"If it's possible would you let me
know am I under investigation ?"

73
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,280
He said
you are not under investigation.

74
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,040
I call bullshit.
I call turbo bullshit on that.

75
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,680
There is no way those conversations
went down in that manner.

76
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,600
Trump managed to be both
a terrible and an amazing liar.

77
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,240
I don't know how
that's physically possible.

78
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,880
Comey's far-more-plausible version
of the dinner mentioned

79
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,440
made its way to the press.

80
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,800
Comey told associates
that at dinner,

81
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,840
the president asked
if he would pledge his loyalty.

82
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,400
Comey declined, instead telling
he would always be honest.

83
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,520
The president asked two more times
and Comey refused again.

84
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,440
The third time, Mr. Trump asked
for "honest loyalty".

85
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,040
To that Comey responded:
"yes, you will have that".

86
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,560
To which Mr. Trump said:
"how about loyal honesty ?"

87
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,320
Comey said: "how's that
different from honest loyalty ?"

88
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,360
Trump said: "if you don't see what
difference it makes, agree to it."

89
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,640
And then Mr. Comey said:
"no way."

90
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,800
To which Mr. Trump replied:
"why not ? Scared ?"

91
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,200
Prompting Mr. Comey
to respond: "idiot says what ?"

92
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,600
To which Mr. Trump replied:
"what ?"

93
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,000
And then Comey's soul
left his body,

94
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,720
turning back to him and saying:
"are you coming ?"

95
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,080
Because frankly
I'm done with this shit.

96
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,640
Trump denied Comey's account
and then, on Friday morning,

97
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,600
he tweeted something ominous
even by his standards.

98
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:12,120
The President threatened
the man he fired as FBI director.

99
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,840
In an extraordinary tweet today,
Trump warned:

100
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,520
"Comey better hope that there
are no tapes of our conversations"

101
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,800
"before he starts
leaking to the press."

102
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,120
Tweets like that
are difficult to parse,

103
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,440
they are somehow both a borderline
obstruction of justice

104
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,520
and the meaningless rantings
of a confused old idiot.

105
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,960
They exist in two opposite
states simultaneously.

106
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,800
Trump is truly
a Schrodinger's asshole.

107
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,640
I will say this: if he is recording
everything in the Oval Office,

108
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't want to hear those tapes.

109
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,080
I'm assuming it's his voice
muttering the sentence:

110
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,960
"I never wanted any of this"
over and over again,

111
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,360
interrupted by mattress commercials
and string cheese farts.

112
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,640
Trump has made it very clear:
he fired the director of the FBI

113
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,360
partially due to unhappiness
with the bureau's investigation

114
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,480
into his campaign's possible
collusion with Russia.

115
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,800
Which is both shocking and yet,
completely unsurprising.

116
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,280
There is nothing Trump could do
to genuinely shock me now.

117
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,520
If he fired Comey because he's
investigating Russia, I'd believe you.

118
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,680
If he did it because Comey is 6' 8"
and Trump feels tiny next to him,

119
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,000
I would believe you.

120
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,120
If he fired Comey,
spread peanut butter on his genitals,

121
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,000
brought in 35 squirrels and
yelled: "daddy's brought dinner !",

122
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,480
I'd say, sure, yeah,
sure, why not.

123
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,080
That sounds like something
the President of the US would do,

124
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,000
that's the world
we live in now.

125
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,840
It is too easy to point
at Trump being crazy.

126
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,600
That's not going to stop and it's going
to be exhausting for everyone.

127
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,880
The question is:
what do the rest of us do ?

128
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,040
And that brings us to Congress,

129
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,240
534 people less annoying than
Ted Cruz, and also Ted Cruz.

130
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,320
It is time for for them
to pick a lane here.

131
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,040
They do have options.
There are the investigations ongoing.

132
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,560
But they could also press Deputy
AG Rod Rosenstein to appoint

133
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,360
a special counsel within
the Justice Department.

134
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,280
But at the very least here,
they need to acknowledge

135
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,000
that what has happened is fucked up
and not continue to give non-answers

136
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,600
like Paul Ryan when asked about
Trump's tape recording threat.

137
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,120
I'm not going to comment on the tweets
of the day or the hour.

138
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,320
I haven't seen them all.
Some of you want to ask this question,

139
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,480
the president has the right
to hire, fire an FBI director.

140
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,280
He made that decision.

141
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,400
Yeah, but that's not answering,
just regurgitating what happened.

142
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,320
It's incredible to watch a man
who spends 90 minutes every morning

143
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,680
working out refuse to show
any strength whatsoever.

144
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,320
Apparently no part of P90X
targets the backbone.

145
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,080
Some members of Congress,
like Rod Blum from Iowa,

146
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,600
don't seem aware of how bad
what they're saying sounds.

147
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,640
Will you support an independent
investigation into Trump

148
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,040
and his campaign's
purported ties to Russia ?

149
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,840
Not at the current time.
If Trump was guilty,

150
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,520
would he fire the FBI director,
that'd be a dumb move.

151
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,080
Yeah, it would, Rod !
Yes !

152
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,160
Unless Blum has a disease where
he says genuine things sarcastically,

153
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,560
that was also
a very stupid thing to say.

154
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,640
Unicorns are imaginary and penises
are where the pee comes from.

155
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,000
Whatever, idiot.
Leave me alone.

156
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,600
The Founding Fathers created
a system of checks and balances

157
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,680
to limit
the power of the president.

158
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,000
But it only works if someone
checks or balances.

159
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,000
And if you don't, it's no longer
on Trump, it's on you.

160
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,000
When you've got the presidential
equivalent of a five year old

161
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,600
shitting on the salad bar
of a Ruby Tuesdays,

162
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,800
at some point, you stop
blaming the five year old

163
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,040
and you start blaming the people
who are not stopping him.

164
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,080
Stop that boy, that's all I'm saying.
Stop that boy, now !

165
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,800
Moving on to a quick update
regarding New Zealand:

166
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,600
wallaby fuck-island.

167
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,360
Last week, we talked about
the historically stupid legal battle

168
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,200
involving that country's ruling Party
being accused of ripping off

169
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,320
the song
"Lose Yourself" by Eminem,

170
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,840
or as they call him
in New Zealand, Immynim.

171
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,600
Our piece was brought to the attention
of New Zealand's Prime Minister,

172
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,840
Bill English, the very poorest
man's Daniel Craig.

173
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,520
It turns out, he is not a fan.

174
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,120
Seen the John Oliver piece
where he mocks the National Party

175
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,640
for allegedly ripping off Eminem ?

176
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,640
- No.
- Do you intend to watch it ?

177
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,480
Some of the stuff I've seen
isn't very funny.

178
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,280
You really want to do this, Bill ?

179
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,200
Is this really what you want ?

180
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,440
When your fellow party member,
Stephen Joyce,

181
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,560
got dick-smacked in the mouth
by a rubber floppy-cock

182
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,800
and then suggested someone
send the GIF over to John Oliver

183
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,360
so we can get it over with,

184
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,240
we ended the show
with a flying dildo-palooza.

185
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,320
When it comes to Kiwis,
Johnny don't play.

186
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,160
Bill English must know that
the moment he mentioned my name,

187
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,760
I was going to find the stupidest,
most humiliating things about him.

188
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,240
Like this actual photo of Bill English
in a virtual reality headset,

189
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,160
which makes him look
like a masturbating cyborg.

190
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,320
Or this indescribably lame video
he made of his exercise routine.

191
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,560
I'm about to head out for a,
what I call a walkrun,

192
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,080
where I walk up the hills
and run the downhill bits.

193
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,720
This is one bit where I run.

194
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,280
And bits like this, I walk.

195
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,120
Still walking.
I'm running this bit.

196
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,080
This bit makes you feel fast.
And this bit makes you feel slow.

197
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,400
I would give anything for Bill English
to make a sex tape.

198
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,200
I'm about to head in
for what I call a penis-vagina,

199
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,640
where I penis the vagina bits
and she vaginas the penis bits.

200
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,240
This is the bit where I penis fast.
This is the bit where I penis slow.

201
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,440
Stick around.
This is gonna to take a while.

202
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,600
The worst thing Bill English
has ever been responsible for

203
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,240
is this recent Facebook post,
where he writes:

204
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,040
cooked dinner for the family,

205
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,120
like if you agree with tinned
spaghetti on pizza

206
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,680
with photos of canned spaghetti
poured all over a revolting pizza.

207
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,360
I speak on behalf of all humanity
when I say: no.

208
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,840
Hard no there, Bill. I do not agree
with canned spaghetti on a pizza.

209
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,960
That is not a thing
anybody should be doing.

210
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,440
A divorced dad cooking for his kids
would not put spaghetti on a pizza.

211
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,520
The caterer
for Chef Boyardee's funeral

212
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,960
would not put
canned spaghetti on a pizza.

213
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,640
You also added pineapple
to that abomination.

214
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,760
And that's not dinner,
that is an actual hate crime.

215
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,240
What is your problem, Bill ?
You made that to feed to your family ?

216
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,640
To your children, Bill ?
How are you not in prison now ?

217
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:50,280
The point is, I am sorry if our show
is not to your liking, Bill English,

218
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,320
Prime Minister of New Zealand.

219
00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:00,200
If I appealed to someone with your
level of taste, I would be mortified.

220
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:06,040
At times like these a lyric from
"Lose Yourself" comes to mind:

221
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,560
His palms are sweaty
knees weak, arms are heavy

222
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,240
There's vomit on his sweater
already, mom's spaghetti.

223
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,440
The reason those lyrics
come to mind is though,

224
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,720
I would rather eat Eminem's
vomit spaghetti off his sweater

225
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,080
than canned spaghetti and pineapple
off one of your garbage pizzas.

226
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,760
And now this.

227
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,640
A series of terrible pizzas

228
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,160
that New Zealand Prime Minister
would probably enjoy.

229
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,880
A pizza topped with skittles,
baking soda and condoms.

230
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,360
A pizza topped with Altoids
and horse laxatives,

231
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,600
and you don't know which is which,
so, good luck with that.

232
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,760
A pizza made by a purebred
Golden Retriever. Good boy !

233
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,440
A pizza topped with blueberries,
onions and a printed out copy

234
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,880
of the Wikipedia entry for pizza.

235
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,800
And finally, a pizza topped
with 25 Blu-Rays of 8 Mile,

236
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,520
because, fuck you.

237
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,200
Bon appetit, Bill, you filthy animal.

238
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,800
Our main story is something
you're probably not expecting.

239
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,360
We're going to talk
about kidney dialysis.

240
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,040
I know you're getting ready
to push the button on your TV remote

241
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,800
marked: "dear, God,
literally anything else".

242
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,800
This is worth listening to. Dialysis is
not something everybody understands.

243
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,520
Listen to one patient describe
a conversation with a neighbor.

244
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,960
I have a lady next door
to me now.

245
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,760
She said to me: "Where do you go
three days a week ?"

246
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:53,160
I said, why, are you writing a book,
a mystery ? I go to dialysis.

247
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,720
She said: "you're a drunk.
I thought you said you didn't drink."

248
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,200
I said: "If you don't get out of
my face, you will need a doctor."

249
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,240
If I was her neighbor,
I would not fuck with that lady.

250
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,520
What I would do is get out
of her face, go home,

251
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,960
Google what dialysis is to cool down
the temperature in that relationship.

252
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,600
Here is the answer: dialysis is where
a machine acts as your kidneys

253
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,000
by taking blood out of your body,
cleaning it, and returning it to you.

254
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,680
Think of it as a Brita pitcher
for your blood.

255
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,760
Which is more disgusting than
I needed to make it sound.

256
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,680
Dialysis can be an exhausting process.
You're sitting in a chair,

257
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,840
physically attached to a machine,
for three four-hour sessions a week.

258
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,920
Americans have been
at increasing risk of needing it,

259
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,560
chronic kidney disease is the 9th
leading cause of death in the US.

260
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,160
While a lucky few
manage to get transplants,

261
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,200
for many, dialysis is their
only option to stay alive.

262
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,160
But interestingly here,
while America spends more

263
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,840
than any other nation on
dialysis care,

264
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,960
we have one of the industrialized
world's highest mortality rates.

265
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,040
So we're spending the most,
to get the least.

266
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,800
We're paying for
a fully-loaded Lamborghini

267
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,480
and receiving a drunk donkey
on roller skates.

268
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:15,240
The story of dialysis is an amazing
case study of good intentions

269
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,360
being thwarted by bad incentives,
poor oversight and profiteering.

270
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,840
One of the key characters
in this story is incredibly this guy !

271
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:44,240
If you think: who is that man doing
barefoot gymnastics to Bob Seger

272
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,960
while dressed like the third saddest
waiter at a Medieval Times ?

273
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,840
That is the CEO
of DaVita incorporated,

274
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,200
a for-profit kidney
dialysis company.

275
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,560
We will get to that man.

276
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,280
Let me give you a sense of the history
of dialysis in this country.

277
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,840
'Cause in the early
years of the machines,

278
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,160
access to them was so limited,
one hospital had a death panel

279
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,200
to decide
who would get to use them.

280
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,320
Somebody has got to decide who
shall live and who shall die ?

281
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,440
Two or three were rejected,
either for medical reasons,

282
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,080
psychiatric reasons,
or just didn't have the $30 000.

283
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,560
Mr. Duff, what happened
to those who were turned down ?

284
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,280
They're dead.

285
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:42,320
My God, that man does not
sugarcoat things. They're dead.

286
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,040
Also your pet only loves you
'cause you feed it,

287
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,520
the Tooth Fairy is your father and
30% of babies grow up to be assholes.

288
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,680
Good day, sir.

289
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,440
In 1972 though,
something amazing happened:

290
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,600
Richard Nixon signed a bill into law
which said that the government

291
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,600
would pay for dialysis
for anyone who needed it.

292
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,960
We have universal health care in this
country for one organ in the body.

293
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,680
It's like your kidneys
are Canadian.

294
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,800
Sorry, there's two of us.

295
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,720
Don't mean to take too
much space up down here.

296
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,320
That's a good accent
and I do not apologize for it.

297
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,520
That's a great accent !

298
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,840
At the time that bill was passed,
it only covered 10 000 patients.

299
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,080
Four decades later, thanks to the rise
of diabetes and high blood pressure,

300
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,320
nearly half a million people
are undergoing dialysis.

301
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,960
That's a 46-fold rise.
46-fold !

302
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,440
That is a pug face's
worth of folds.

303
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,000
As a result, treating
end-stage kidney disease

304
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,000
takes up nearly one percent
of the entire federal budget.

305
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,160
We devote two percent of the federal
budget to the Department of Education

306
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,600
and that's the thing that helps
you know what a percent is.

307
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,920
A vast industry has emerged
to accommodate all these patients:

308
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
there are around 7 000 outpatient
dialysis clinics in the country today

309
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,480
and around 70 percent are owned by
two big, for-profit companies:

310
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,280
Fresenius and DaVita.

311
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,880
There are significant issues
with both of them.

312
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,240
Tonight we're going to focus
on DaVita.

313
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,240
Their CEO, Kent Thiry, is the
showboating musketeer you saw,

314
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,160
and he loves to inspire
his employees at meetings.

315
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,360
He's also made grand
entrances on a bicycle.

316
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,480
He's even ridden in on a horse.
Spare a thought for that horse there.

317
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,160
That is by far the most humiliating
credit on its resume

318
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,680
and it did used to do porn,
so bear that in mind.

319
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,520
Thiry is a former Bain & Company
consultant,

320
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,400
who took DaVita from near-bankruptcy
to being valued at $13 billion.

321
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,760
He's been the subject
of an admiring case study,

322
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,080
which called his management
style "arguably eccentric".

323
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,040
He calls his company a "village",

324
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,920
his employees
"teammates" or "citizens",

325
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,840
and as for himself,
he's got his own special title.

326
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,680
This is KT, your mayor from
the Casa Nueva in Colorado.

327
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,360
Yes, you heard right:
he calls himself the mayor.

328
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,960
A title so ridiculous, you haven't
noticed he's standing next to a falcon.

329
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,400
That is the most humiliating
thing on that bird's resume

330
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,800
and it used to do porn.

331
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,440
At this point, we should address
the whole weird musketeer thing.

332
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,960
It's an obsession
that apparently stems

333
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,480
from the Leonardo DiCaprio movie
"The Man in the Iron Mask",

334
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,560
which Thiry says inspired him to make
a "transformative life decision"

335
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,280
to take the DaVita job,
which is already insane.

336
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,480
This is a ridiculous movie to choose
as the basis for anything.

337
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,960
Let me give you
just a small taste.

338
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,120
If we must die,
have it be like this.

339
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,800
One for all, all for one.

340
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,720
That remains one of the weirdest
decisions in moviemaking history:

341
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,680
"the world's biggest heartthrob
at the peak of his popularity"

342
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,760
"agreed to be in our movie,
what should we do with him ?"

343
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,680
Let's put him in a weird mask
and just have him stand there.

344
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,680
Teenage girls all across America

345
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,640
are going to have that image
on their bedroom walls.

346
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,720
He looks even hotter now.

347
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,920
Thiry even closes company
meetings quoting that movie.

348
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,080
If we must dialyze let it be like this,
one for all.

349
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,680
All for one.

350
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,360
- One for all !
- All for one.

351
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,760
Damn straight, have fun.
Good night !

352
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,480
Cool.

353
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,240
For shareholders,
Thiry's techniques worked,

354
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,120
DaVita posted nearly $800 million
in profit last year.

355
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,040
The experience for patients
can be different.

356
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,840
DaVita runs a lean operation,
which the government allows.

357
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,800
Federal guidelines don't require
clinics to have a doctor on site

358
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,360
at any given time,
which seems a little odd.

359
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,400
They also require that only one
nurse be present in the facility.

360
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,320
And a study has found
that for-profit clinics have

361
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,960
about as third fewer nurses
than their nonprofit competitors.

362
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,640
That may explain
why some DaVita patients say

363
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,720
they can feel like they're a product
on a factory line.

364
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,320
I have techs come up to me and say
that's enough dialysis.

365
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,280
You done pulled off plenty.
It wager in my mind to believe,

366
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,080
am I getting my full treatment ?

367
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,600
Just because they're behind ?

368
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,160
You can't just speed up dialysis
because you're behind schedule,

369
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,440
it is a critical medical procedure,
not a shower.

370
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,920
I've got three minutes,
I'm washing the important parts:

371
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
hair, armpits, and penis
'cause it's my little buddy.

372
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,680
I'd never forget you, bud.

373
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,280
Dialysis workers in California
are trying to unionize over issues

374
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,040
including staffing levels.

375
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,560
One former DaVita nurse
of more than a decade,

376
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:42,720
fired for asking employees to join
a union where he no longer worked,

377
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,200
says workers felt pressured
to transition between patients fast.

378
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:55,360
Priorities for transitioning patients
was to get them on dialysis

379
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,880
and get the next patient on
and it was all about numbers.

380
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,920
You want to get 'em in,
get their dialysis done

381
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,440
and get the next patient on
and you would have sometimes

382
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:13,160
15, maybe 25 minutes
to get that next patient on a machine,

383
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,360
so you were not properly disinfecting
or doing the things properly.

384
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,360
Not properly disinfecting,
that cannot be ok.

385
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,600
I don't even want to go into a movie
theater that hasn't been cleaned,

386
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,800
and there is shuffling through
a waist-deep layer of popcorn

387
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,640
and dried sticky Cherry Coke.

388
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,920
DaVita will tell you its clinics
operate to a high standard of care,

389
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,520
its patients aren't rushed,
they have happy staff and customers

390
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,640
and shown steady improvement.

391
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,400
They'll even point
to the high number of clinics

392
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,440
that received four and five stars from
the government's rating system.

393
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,640
Weirdly, those ratings don't reflect

394
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,880
things like government inspection
reports for the clinics.

395
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,560
Remember that patient from before ?
We pulled her clinic's recent report,

396
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,960
which cited multiple problems
with infection control practices

397
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,120
and a failure to demonstrate overall
responsibility for the governance

398
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,440
and operation of the facility,
which placed all patients,

399
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,840
staff and visitors at risk
of harm and possible death.

400
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,480
Guess how many stars it has ?
Four stars.

401
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,920
That four-star rating should
come with a big asterisk,

402
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,360
which to be fair, does technically
constitute a 5th star.

403
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,040
Congratulations !

404
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,680
If it's beginning to feel like
a volume business,

405
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,360
when you listen to Kent Thiry,
that can seem like it's by design.

406
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,360
Listen to him addressing
business students at UCLA,

407
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,400
about what he sees
as his company's role in society.

408
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,920
I almost never refer to patients
in the entire thing,

409
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,720
for me it's not patients,
it's teammates.

410
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,240
When you're in healthcare
it is nicer, easier

411
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,680
in the sense that you're
very directly helping human beings.

412
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,720
If I had 1 400 Taco Bells

413
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,240
and 32 000 people
who worked in them,

414
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,520
I would be doing
all the same stuff.

415
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,960
Yes, you heard him right:
he just said he manages DaVita,

416
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,600
a health care company,
like he would a Taco Bell,

417
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,880
the exact opposite
of a health care company.

418
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,240
Taco Bell has made a shell
entirely out of fried chicken.

419
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,040
Sounds crazy. But is it ?

420
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,880
When you see
the Naked Chicken Chalupa,

421
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,720
you might think it's crazy,
crazy delicious !

422
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,000
It's a pretty safe sign that
your product is awful

423
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,400
when your commercial has to assure
people on two occasions:

424
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,960
We know we sound mentally ill,
but trust us: it is food.

425
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,120
It's actually food, I know !

426
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,520
DaVita might tell you that they have
to run their business so lean,

427
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,800
because the reimbursement they get
doesn't really cover their costs.

428
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,120
They have been accused of finding
innovative ways around that.

429
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,400
A few years ago, the company
was sued over accusations

430
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,080
it had paid kickbacks
to doctors for business.

431
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,720
The scheme is complicated,
but it basically works like this:

432
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,160
DaVita would pick out doctors
and physicians groups

433
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,920
who cared for a large number of
patients who had renal disease.

434
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,960
It would offer them lucrative deals
to refer patients to their clinics.

435
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,440
So that is not good.
You want to be sure that a doctor

436
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,960
is referring you to a clinic
because it's the best one for you,

437
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,760
not because they have
a financial relationship.

438
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,800
You should only advocate
for a product you believe in,

439
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,160
like DeWalt ladders.

440
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:46,440
They don't pay me to say nice things
about their products, people.

441
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,560
Why would they ?
The ladders speak for themselves.

442
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,520
DaVita denied wrongdoing.
But they did settle that lawsuit

443
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,920
for $389 million.

444
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,920
Remember that, because
it's about to become a theme.

445
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,360
In 2012, a former medical director
at a DaVita facility went public

446
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,600
with claims about how DaVita treated
some of the medicine

447
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,600
that it could charge Medicare for.

448
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,920
Let's say a patient needed 100 mg
of a drug called Venofer.

449
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,840
You could give them,
say, one 100-milligram vial.

450
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,120
Or you could do this.

451
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:27,080
What DaVita did, is out of this one
vial they gave 50 mg out of this vial.

452
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,120
Where's it go ?
Trash.

453
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:36,360
25, 75 to the trash.
25 again, 75 to the trash.

454
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,880
The more vials DaVita used, the more
DaVita was able to bill the government.

455
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,240
That is the biggest waste of drugs

456
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,960
since anyone who's done cocaine
in a windstorm.

457
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,840
On the bright side,
those pigeons look confident

458
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,040
and they have somehow
written screenplays.

459
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,400
There you go. That's
the beauty of cocaine, everyone.

460
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,480
That's the beauty.

461
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,800
DaVita denied wrongdoing.
And they did so

462
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,000
even as they agreed to pay up to
$495 million to settle that case.

463
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,960
That's an almost-half-a-billion
dollar "oops",

464
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,520
or as Yankees fans call it:
an A-Rod.

465
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:22,840
A separate case accused them
not so much of throwing

466
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,280
extra drugs into the trash,
as throwing them into patients.

467
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,640
That involved
something called Epogen,

468
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,040
a medication used to raise
a patient's red blood cell count.

469
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,920
A whistleblower said the personnel
referred to it as "liquid gold".

470
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,720
It accounted for a quarter
of the company's revenue

471
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,520
and up to 40 percent
of its earnings.

472
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,160
It was later discovered that at the
higher dosage levels DaVita used,

473
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,240
there was "no solid evidence
that Epogen made people feel better,"

474
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,040
"improved survival, or had
any clinical benefit at all."

475
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,440
Which is also the new tagline
for this television show.

476
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,600
It seems harsh,
but increasingly fair.

477
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,320
I think you know what is coming:
DaVita denied any wrongdoing

478
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,720
and settled that lawsuit
for $55 million.

479
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,160
DaVita keep settle cases, they can't
afford to get shut out from Medicare.

480
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,480
Just the three cases I have
mentioned in the last five years

481
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,880
have resulted in them paying out
nearly a billion dollars.

482
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,360
That doesn't exactly give you
confidence in their product.

483
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,200
If the Fleshlight company paid
a billion dollars in settlements,

484
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,400
you would fuck
a microwaved cantaloupe.

485
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,840
Yeah, 30 seconds on defrost.
Trust me. 30 seconds.

486
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,600
No more, but no less.

487
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,000
30 seconds is the sweet spot,
ding, business time.

488
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:54,400
The point is here is where
we get to the final

489
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,920
and possibly hardest part
of this story.

490
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,520
No matter what standard
of care you get,

491
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,280
the longer you are on dialysis,
the worse things look for you.

492
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,040
People who are on dialysis,
how long are they gonna last ?

493
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,040
The statistics are that one year
after being on dialysis,

494
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,800
your death rate is 25%.

495
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,640
By five years,
it's sixty-five percent.

496
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,520
Numbers like that are why, if you
are eligible to get a transplant,

497
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,560
you absolutely should get one.

498
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,640
It can double, or even triple
your survival rate.

499
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,560
The government's main requirement
for clinics in educating patients

500
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:36,160
is that they simply check
a box indicating that they've done so.

501
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,880
Multiple studies questioned the quality
of some clinics' education.

502
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,840
Thousands of kidney patients
in the US start dialysis

503
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,200
without first being told
about kidney transplants,

504
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,960
or that that is cheaper
and leads to longer lives.

505
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,640
The newspaper reviewed records
from the US Renal Data System

506
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,200
and they found that some patients
spend five years on dialysis

507
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,600
before being put on
the transplant list.

508
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,120
Some clinics leave out information
that people should know.

509
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,040
And information on transplants
at a dialysis clinic is a bit like

510
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:14,080
information about the number of
ferrets you own while on a Tinder date.

511
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:19,480
Disclose that shit, so that people
don't make a huge mistake.

512
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,720
You have to do that.
It's not right.

513
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,160
You disclose that shit. You let her
know. What's wrong with you ?

514
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,240
DaVita disputes that those
studies reflect their practices,

515
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,480
saying that their most recent
internal figures show them

516
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,520
outperforming their competitors
in patients receiving a transplant.

517
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,200
We wanted to get a glimpse of what
their education might look like

518
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,760
and it wasn't great.

519
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:53,160
DaVita offers "Kidney Smart" classes
and they're open to the public.

520
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,480
We sent four staffers to classes
at four clinics in New York.

521
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,800
And they were all struck by how
little emphasis was placed

522
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,520
on the benefits of transplants
and that they were often presented

523
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,680
as an equivalent choice
to dialysis.

524
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,160
Here is what happened when one
staffer asked specifically

525
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,960
about whether people who came
to that clinic sought transplants.

526
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,040
It's actually a choice.
You don't have to do a transplant.

527
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,040
I've had patients that decided
no, I don't want that.

528
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:26,720
If you don't have a donor,
you go on the transplant list,

529
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:32,800
when they do call you,
you have the right to say no.

530
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,760
You never know,
things happen.

531
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,360
I mean this is a family...
I know I say this, and it sounds crazy,

532
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,040
but I've had patients, that said,
no I don't think I want to leave,

533
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,880
so I won't take the transplant.

534
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,160
And they stayed.
This is their community.

535
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,000
Suggesting that the cozy atmosphere
of a DaVita dialysis center

536
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,040
is a valid reason to turn down
a kidney transplant

537
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:01,480
is the moral equivalent of watching
someone tread water in the ocean

538
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,200
and not encouraging him
to take a rope.

539
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,240
Are you sure ? Are you sure
the ocean isn't your community ?

540
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,360
Are you sure you want people
have turned this rope down.

541
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,560
There's no bad decision here !

542
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,240
We focused on DaVita because
they have the most patients

543
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,120
and Kent Thiry dresses
like an idiot all the time.

544
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,040
A lot of the problems run throughout
the forprofit dialysis industry,

545
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:33,400
including Fresenius, who just last year
agreed to a $250 million settlement

546
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,840
for thousands of lawsuits claiming
the company's products

547
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,080
had caused heart problems
and deaths,

548
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,120
claims that they deny, because,
of course they do.

549
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,040
I know that all of this
has been very complicated,

550
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,440
but there are
a few key lessons here.

551
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,960
We need to make sure dialysis
clinics have better oversight.

552
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,320
We need to create better
incentives for transplants,

553
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,840
for treating kidney disease earlier,
to keep patients out of dialysis.

554
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,640
There are things that everyone
can do to combat the kidney shortage.

555
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,720
Truly amazing people can donate
one kidney while they're still alive

556
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,360
and if you are someone
considering doing that, holy shit:

557
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,280
you're an amazing human being.

558
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,880
Feel free to go to GiveandLive.US,
for more information on that.

559
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:25,360
For the rest of us complete assholes,
we should at least, at the very least,

560
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,080
be organ donors when we die.

561
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,160
Organs go to waste as families hesitate
to approve when a loved one dies.

562
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,920
Please make sure that your family
knows that you want to be a donor.

563
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,360
And once you've done that,
maybe tweet out,

564
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,000
hashtag "when I die,
please take my kidneys".

565
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,960
It will fuck with Twitter's
"trending topics" tomorrow.

566
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:53,520
This country did a truly amazing
thing. Richard Nixon did a...

567
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,160
Really ?
History has changed.

568
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:03,320
Nixon did a truly amazing thing.
He said we should take care of people

569
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,800
with kidney disease, and we did it
and we should keep doing it,

570
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,800
but we could do it a lot better.

571
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,640
Is way too important to be treated
like a fast-food experience.

572
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,640
There is another victim of this
story and that is Taco Bell.

573
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,360
Taco Bell is owed an apology.

574
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,480
That sentence has never before
made sense in English.

575
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,240
But Taco Bell, I am sorry
that a middle-aged musketeer

576
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,720
dragged you into this.

577
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,960
I know that you're not going
to stand up for yourselves.

578
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,800
You're too busy plotting your next
"Kristallnacht for the bowels".

579
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:46,840
Don't worry, take it easy:
we've prepared a commercial for you.

580
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,080
Please enjoy.

581
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,640
Hi, we're Taco Bell. You may know us
from Volcano Nachos,

582
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,600
the Beefy Fritos Burrito, and that taco
with fried chicken for a shell.

583
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,880
You don't wanna run a health care
business like a Taco Bell.

584
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,320
You shouldn't really run
a Taco Bell like a Taco Bell.

585
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,680
No shit.

586
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,480
We're nothing
like dialysis clinics.

587
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,840
You may be more likely to find
a doctor in one of our restaurants

588
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,480
than in a dialysis clinic.

589
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,640
- Shit. Can you blur my face ?
- Sure !

590
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,000
- And the crunch wrap ?
- Fuck yeah, we can.

591
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,000
We've made our fair share
of dubious claims.

592
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:29,400
You know those breakfast burritos ?
This is what one actually looks like.

593
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,720
Gross.

594
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,080
But we sure as shit haven't spent
the last few years paying out

595
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,720
nearly a billion dollars
to settle lawsuits,

596
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,680
because we run a tight ship.

597
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:43,120
If I lick the dust off the Doritos taco
shells they become regular taco shells.

598
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,760
Our food may be barely fit
for human consumption,

599
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,920
but at least our CEO dresses
in a suit like a human person.

600
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,120
He doesn't make us call him
the mayor

601
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,360
or do any of that
weird musketeer nonsense.

602
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,280
We're a company,
not a child's birthday party.

603
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,840
Exactly. And while our food
may be medically inadvisable,

604
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,880
even we know that if you can,
you should get a kidney transplant.

605
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,680
You should absolutely
get a kidney transplant.

606
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,000
Yeah. No shit.

607
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,520
How'd you get back here ?

608
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,360
Taco Bell. Hey, for once,
we're the good guys here !

609
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,520
That's our show. Thanks so much.
See you next week. Good night !

610
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,960
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

611
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,360
END OF EPISODE 12,
SEASON IV
