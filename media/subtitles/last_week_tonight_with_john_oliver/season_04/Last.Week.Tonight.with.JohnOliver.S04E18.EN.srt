00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,200
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,680
Season IV
Episode 18

3
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,200
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,160
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,320
And let us dive right in
with President Trump.

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,520
The "Bachelor In Paradise"
of American presidents.

7
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,800
We have to start with the fact
that on Thursday,

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,320
the president sent disgusting
tweets about Mika Brzezinski,

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,000
tweets that were indefensible.

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,400
White House press secretary
Sarah Huckabee Sanders,

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,480
the least amusing cast member
in a faithbased romantic comedy,

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,960
gave it her very best shot.

13
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,160
The president has been attacked
mercilessly on personal accounts

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,760
by members on that program,
and I think he's been very clear

15
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,400
that when he gets attacked,
he's gonna hit back.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,040
She's kind of right about that:

17
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,560
Trump is basically a walrus
wearing a t-shirt that says:

18
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,880
"I have diarrhea !"

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,720
He's pretty open about
how grossly shitty he can be.

20
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,240
So we can't be shocked
when he suddenly is.

21
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,360
That news overshadowed
the president's travel ban,

22
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,600
which the administration
has long maintained is not a ban

23
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,520
despite what you may have heard
from biased mainstream media outlets

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,320
like the president of the US
and the dictionary.

25
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,920
You may remember Trump's
original order

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,520
"halted all refugee admissions
and temporarily barred people"

27
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,000
"from seven
Muslim-majority countries".

28
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,400
It was met with widespread
protests and dozens of lawsuits,

29
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,720
resulting in courts
placing both the ban

30
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,800
and Trump's subsequent
revision of that ban, on hold.

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,280
This week, the Supreme Court
got to weigh in.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,520
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled
to partially reinstate

33
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,000
the president's controversial
travel ban

34
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,280
before hearing arguments
in October.

35
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,600
At first the ban was banned, the
court has partially banned the ban-ban,

36
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,520
instituting a partial ban pending the
possibility of a future partial-ban.

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,400
The court impose restrictions, saying
it couldn't apply to anyone with

38
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,360
"a credible claim
of a bona fide relationship"

39
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,480
"with a person or entity
in the US."

40
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,120
The natural question there is, what
constitutes a bona fide relationship ?

41
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,720
The Trump administration
took a swing at answering that.

42
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,080
The State Department has narrowly
defined that as a parent or child,

43
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,760
including in-laws,
a sibling, or a spouse.

44
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,720
The guidelines for
who's considered close family

45
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,040
does not include grandparents,
aunts or uncles,

46
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,960
nieces or nephews, cousins and
brothers or sisters-in-law.

47
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:07,120
Grandparents aren't close family ?
Good luck telling them that !

48
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,680
That would require calling them,
a 12 or 13-minute conversation,

49
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,480
that would involve being asked
whether you remember Jerry Flaxman.

50
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,760
Jerry Flaxman who used
to live down the street.

51
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,440
Jerry. Flaxman.
You remember him.

52
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,640
He had the daughter with internet
business and she's gay now ? Flaxman.

53
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,440
What was her name ? Jamie ?
Either Jamie or Amanda.

54
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,560
Samantha Flaxman. Anyway,
her father is Jerry Flaxman.

55
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,840
He's dead now.

56
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,520
While the definition
of the ban is ridiculous,

57
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,720
the impacts of it are real,
particularly for refugees.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,640
The administration decided
that being assisted

59
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,760
by a refugee-resettlement agency
does not constitute a "bona fide".

60
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,880
Thousands of desperate people,
gone through exhaustive vetting

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,160
and have been approved to come,
have been left in the lurch.

62
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,120
Which is shameful. And yet,
for some, it's no big deal,

63
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,160
an attitude exemplified by human
lacrosse stick Tucker Carlson,

64
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,240
who asked: "hashtag Tucker.
Why does America benefit"

65
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,880
"from having tons of people
from failing countries come here ?"

66
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,080
That made the Statue of Liberty
give up and drown herself.

67
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,880
If I may just point out, Tucks:
just because a nation is failing,

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,640
doesn't mean it can't produce
amazing people.

69
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,520
I think we all know who
exhibit A for this is,

70
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,760
a successful nation can produce
truly failed human beings.

71
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,440
Hashtag Tucker.

72
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,120
This ban is cruel,
it's unnecessary

73
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,640
and it undermines
our standing in the world.

74
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,400
You would think the president
would be justifying its existence.

75
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,480
He keeps derailing the conversation
with his barrage of bullshit.

76
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,800
There is no better example
of this than the fact that,

77
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,000
ABC's "This Week" had a homeland
security adviser on to discuss the ban,

78
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,960
but they never got around to it,
they addressed another unhinged tweet.

79
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,920
Watch the guy's face as he realizes
what he's about to have to talk about.

80
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,880
I wanna get to security
questions and security concerns,

81
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,920
but we've had the president
tweet a GIF, I want you to look at.

82
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,520
Trump has taken some video
and put a CNN mic logo

83
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,000
on who he's beating up.

84
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,000
I have no choice but to admit
that Trump was right:

85
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,880
there is at least one grandparent
who poses a threat to America.

86
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,080
Unfortunately it's the grandparent
currently in fucking charge of it.

87
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,560
And now, this.

88
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,480
CBS-2 Meteorologist John Elliott
engages in too much self-deprecation.

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,280
I have been cast as
the wacky redhead for years.

90
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,920
I'm just kinda stuck.

91
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,440
Diary of a Wimpy Kid, the working
title of my autobiography

92
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,920
and then he had
great success with it.

93
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,400
I'll get in trouble here,
I did not like Homecoming dance.

94
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,560
I had to beg Janet to go with me
and then Sarah,

95
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,960
she couldn't
get a dress the second year.

96
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,200
When the package is this boring,
no one cares what's inside.

97
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,360
When they tested me for TV
they said I was stern,

98
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,400
and had no future
in the business.

99
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,040
Gravity will get you every time.
Take it from me, the leprechaun.

100
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,760
In the elevator, total strangers,
what are they gonna do ?

101
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,720
They can't leave, so yeah have fun
and just say hi to folks.

102
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,680
My wife can't, does not like
my cargo shorts.

103
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,200
Moving on. Our main story
concerns local news.

104
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,040
It's mostly known for informative
and hard-hitting segments.

105
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,920
Police say one of the masked
suspects, armed with a hand gun,

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,800
walked up to the victim's window,
pointed the gun right at her face,

107
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,280
and told her he wanted her purse,
money and cell phone.

108
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,360
Holy shit.

109
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,240
That is a great way to
make people pay attention

110
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,560
to a story they
may not be interested in.

111
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,120
And with that in mind...
Our main story tonight concerns

112
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,960
the potential problems in corporate
consolidation of local news.

113
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,960
Don't you dare
change the channel.

114
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,000
National cable news gets
a lot of attention,

115
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,960
with their big budgets
and fancy graphics packages.

116
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,840
Local news often has to do
a lot more with a lot less.

117
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,440
The black bear was roaming
through Tina's backyard.

118
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,400
Tina was too stunned to get a picture
but this is what the bear looked like.

119
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,720
This recreation identifies
how witnesses say the bear escaped.

120
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,000
Whoever is hiding behind that tiny
bear cutout deserves a Pulitzer.

121
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:16,680
He could have stood up straight and
walked the bear across the garden.

122
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,960
But he didn't do that. He hunched
down, because he cares.

123
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,960
That man is a journalist.

124
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,360
It's easy for me to make fun,

125
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,920
but local news
fills an important role:

126
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,640
finding stories
the national news is missing.

127
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,720
This show uses local news all the time.
Our civil forfeiture piece

128
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,320
used outstanding reporting from
Tennessee's News Channel Five

129
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,560
and our piece on problems with 911
used great work from "11 Alive".

130
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,640
A Pew study found that local news
is trusted more than national news.

131
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,240
So, yes: when you watch local
news, you may see something silly.

132
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,520
You also may see something great.
And there's actually a third option.

133
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,920
Because in some parts
of the country, you might see this.

134
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,400
I've got a message
for certain students:

135
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,320
listen up closely, snowflake.

136
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,360
Yes, I'm talking to you.
You, the social justice warrior

137
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,200
who whines for trigger warnings
and safe spaces.

138
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,960
Not grown-up enough
to deal with the facts ?

139
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,600
Then hunker down in your room
and Snapchat the day away.

140
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,520
College isn't a babysitting service.
It's time to grow up, snowflake.

141
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,200
That man is Mark Hyman,
with one in what I presume

142
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,480
is a series featuring titles like:
"Wake Up, Libtard",

143
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,080
"Cucked Much, Ya Little Beta Baby ?"
"Knock Knock, Sheeple, It's Me: Truth"

144
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,560
with Mark Hyman.

145
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,320
Hyman is a commentator and former
executive at Sinclair Broadcast Group.

146
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,600
Sinclair may be the most influential
media company you've never heard of.

147
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,440
Not only are they the largest
owner of local TV stations,

148
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,400
they could soon get even bigger.

149
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,080
Sinclair will pay about $4 billion for
Tribune Media and its 42 stations.

150
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,640
Combined companies will create
the largest group of TV stations.

151
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,960
It is a little disconcerting to learn
that something you've only heard of

152
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,480
is throwing around
four billion dollars.

153
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,800
It's like finding out that Exxon
Mobil just got bought

154
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,080
and it was by the little twerp
who plays the new Spiderman.

155
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,000
How is that possible ? How does
spider-twerp have the resources ?

156
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,400
I only just found out he existed !

157
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,360
This acquisition still
needs regulatory approval,

158
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,360
but it is assumed that will happen,
Sinclair's reach could expand.

159
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,800
We found out that when you combine
the most-watched nightly newscasts

160
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,240
on Sinclair and Tribune stations
in their largest markets,

161
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,600
you get an average total
viewership of 2.2 million households.

162
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,440
It's more than any current
prime time show on Fox News,

163
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,560
including "Five Idiots Have The
Most Intolerable Dinner Party Ever"

164
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,880
and "That Guy From College Everyone
Hated Has A Talk Show Now".

165
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,400
Sinclair's content tilts
noticeably conservative.

166
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,240
Remember that snowflake guy ?
Sinclair produces those segments

167
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,400
and sends them
to their affiliates.

168
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,520
As best we can tell, no other
major owner of TV stations

169
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,360
distributes its own commentary
segments to run during local news.

170
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,280
Hyman's opinions hew hard-right.

171
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,920
We are threatened by a nasty cancer
epidemic, it's a danger to our nation.

172
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,560
Political correctness
and multiculturalism.

173
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,040
Words once acceptable in polite
conversation are no longer.

174
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,000
"Handicapped" and "retarded"
are off limits.

175
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,800
There is one step that's proven to
reduce domestic violence. Marriage.

176
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,480
I am now a proud
Washington Redskins fan.

177
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,360
The opinion that only black people
can legitimately have an afro ?

178
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,680
Someone should tell that to
folk singer, Art Garfunkel.

179
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,440
What are you talking about ?
As I believe Paul Simon once said:

180
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,880
"there's no need to involve
Art Garfunkel in any of this."

181
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,560
Hyman is not Sinclair's
only conservative voice.

182
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,560
They hired a man
named Boris Epshteyn,

183
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,640
a former Trump advisor, who you
may remember from TV appearances,

184
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,440
where he made wild claims.

185
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,240
Barack Obama may have won in 2008
North Carolina due to illegal voting.

186
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:33,040
Where are you getting that from ?
Obama won because of voter fraud ?

187
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,080
5% of voting in North Carolina
may have been by non-citizens

188
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,120
and swung North Carolina
to Mr. Obama.

189
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,280
That is nothing
even resembling a fact.

190
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,520
The claim that he's making received
a "pants on fire" from PolitiFact.

191
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,120
And even if it were true,

192
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,080
Obama still would have beat
McCain by 162 electoral votes.

193
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,680
Do Trump surrogates
even know why they are lying ?

194
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,840
Or are they driven by some instinct,
like when a cat sits inside a box ?

195
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,360
Why are you doing that ?
I have no idea.

196
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,720
There's just something
inside me that tells me I should.

197
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,360
Epshteyn is now Sinclair's
"chief political analyst"

198
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,560
and has a segment
called "Bottom Line with Boris".

199
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,400
Let me show you one, concerning
a retracted story on CNN.

200
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,120
CNN, along
with other cable news networks,

201
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,040
is struggling to stick to the facts
and to be impartial in politics,

202
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,880
in general,
and this president, specifically.

203
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,320
That could not have been more pot
calling the kettle black if he said:

204
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,200
The bottom line is, CNN is a rejected
extra from "The Sopranos"

205
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,920
in a JCPenney's tie whose voice
sounds like Sylvester Stallone

206
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,480
with a mouth full of bees.

207
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,640
Sinclair doesn't just lean
right with its commentators,

208
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,000
even its ad breaks put
a thumb on the scale.

209
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,720
In 2010, Sinclair's Pittsburgh affiliate
pulled a 30-second Democratic ad off,

210
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,200
and found that some claims
in the ad were unsubstantiated.

211
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,960
It is good that they were willing
to take a stand

212
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,840
to ensure nothing inaccurate
made its way on-air.

213
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,280
A few months later,
that exact same station,

214
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:25,200
aired a 25-minute attack ad
on Democrats,

215
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,200
featuring assertions like this.

216
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:33,840
During his election, he wound
up with $750 million in his campaign.

217
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,560
To this day, he refuses
to report from whence it came.

218
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,240
One reason might be that some of it
originated from the group Hamas.

219
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,800
Oh my God.

220
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,360
If you are going to make up scary
donors to the Obama campaign,

221
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,160
why stop with Hamas,
keep going.

222
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,600
He won't say where
the money came from.

223
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,040
One reason may be that it originated
with this gang of coyotes

224
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,200
that has made billions selling human
babies to other, hungrier coyotes.

225
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,880
If the opinions were confined just
to the commentary, or ad breaks,

226
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,440
that would be one thing.

227
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,320
Sinclair can dictate the content
of your local newscast as well.

228
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,160
And in contrast to Fox News,
a clearly conservative outlet,

229
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,200
with Sinclair, they're injecting
Fox-worthy content

230
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,720
into the mouths of your
local news anchors:

231
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,480
the two people who you know
and who you trust,

232
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,760
and whose on-screen chemistry can
best be described as "two people".

233
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,080
You may not realize
it's happening.

234
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,560
Sinclair, and its digital
news subsidiary, Circa,

235
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,120
not only produce
and send packages,

236
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,400
they write scripts that local anchors
can use to introduce the pieces.

237
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,880
This Tuesday night,
anchors at Sinclair stations

238
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,160
introduced a story
about Michael Flynn like this.

239
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,880
Did the FBI have a personal vendetta
in pursuing the Russia investigation

240
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,360
of Trump's former
security adviser Michael Flynn ?

241
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,720
Did the FBI have a personal vendetta
in pursuing the Russia investigation

242
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,800
of Trump's former security
adviser Michael Flynn ?

243
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,440
Did the FBI.
Have a personal vendetta.

244
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:19,120
In pursuing the Russia investigation.
Of Trump's former security adviser.

245
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,640
Did the FBI have
a personal vendetta ?

246
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,600
It could very well be true.

247
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,520
Yeah, but you could say "it could
very well be true" about anything.

248
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,120
Are all peanut M&M's snake eggs
painted different colors ?

249
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,320
Do foxes walk on their hind legs
when no one is looking ?

250
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,000
Is there only one Olsen twin,
who's moving back and forth

251
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,640
to trick the human eye into seeing
two of them ?

252
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,520
All of those things "could"
very well be true,

253
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,880
aside from that one about
the Olsen twins, none of them are.

254
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,640
The story they were teasing
was that Michael Flynn

255
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,480
had spoken up on behalf
of a former FBI agent

256
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,520
in a gender discrimination
suit against the agency.

257
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,640
But it is a huge stretch
to get from there

258
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,440
to an agency-wide
conspiracy to bring him down.

259
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,880
There is real power in hearing
your trusted local newscasters

260
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,280
using "FBI " and "personal
vendetta" in a sentence.

261
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,200
If those same newscasters somehow
used the words "Daniel Stern"

262
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,160
and "explosive ejaculation"
in the same sentence,

263
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,160
you could never watch
Home Alone the same way again.

264
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,400
Sinclair's content
can often not be optional.

265
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,640
They regularly send out
what are called "must-runs",

266
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,040
segments that station managers are
directed to work into their broadcasts.

267
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,240
Boris Epshteyn and Mark Hyman's
segments are must-runs.

268
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,240
And so are some
"news" segments,

269
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,720
let me give you a taste
of a "must-run" story

270
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,880
that ran just a month before
last year's election.

271
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,720
How can Americans, especially
Blacks and Latinos in America,

272
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,360
support Hillary Clinton ?

273
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,720
It's a surprising message
coming from a black pastor,

274
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,600
but bishop Aubrey Shines
is spreading a message

275
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,720
of why he believes
Hillary Clinton's Democratic Party

276
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,840
isn't good for black Americans.

277
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,360
The party that gave this country
slavery, the KKK, Jim Crow laws.

278
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,160
Hold on, just hold on a second there:
Democrats "gave" this country slavery ?

279
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,360
It's more complicated than that.
Someone "gave" me this haircut.

280
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,240
I'm accountable for being
comfortable with it, liking it

281
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,280
and keeping it for a morally
repugnant amount of time.

282
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,440
You can maybe see why that
could be news in Florida.

283
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,520
"Tampa pastor makes crazy video."
But that piece ran in Columbus,

284
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,680
El Paso, Omaha, Syracuse,
Seattle, Green Bay, Tulsa

285
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,720
and stations all over the country.

286
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:52,760
Sinclair didn't let all that
pastor's assertions go by unchecked.

287
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,280
They had the brief
appearance of balance,

288
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,040
bringing in this political scientist
who fact-checked the video.

289
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,600
He was given less
screen time than the pastor

290
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,200
and the voiceover
undercut him at every turn.

291
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,480
Bullock says that shines
cherry-picked his history.

292
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:13,920
But if you have the whole context
of history, where they miss pieces,

293
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,480
you would not be persuaded.

294
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,080
So about that history:
when it comes to the KKK,

295
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,000
historians agree it was created
in post-Civil War reconstruction

296
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,560
by Democrats, and later,

297
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,440
Southern Democrats were
behind the Jim Crow laws.

298
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,600
That was the party of the South
and as I've mentioned, over time,

299
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,800
those parties have shifted in terms
of what their membership base is.

300
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,280
I love his frustration
as he tries to explain

301
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,720
that now is
not one hundred years ago.

302
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,120
You almost expect him to say:
"Neither of us are wearing bowler hats"

303
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,240
"and that woman
over there has a job !"

304
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,600
"All of which supports
my theory that, as I've mentioned,"

305
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,360
"now is not
100 years ago."

306
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,880
The must-runs are not
just individual pieces,

307
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,200
they are also recurring features,
like poll questions,

308
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,960
which can range
from benign to pretty leading.

309
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,280
What did you think
of today's Comey testimony:

310
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,680
it was all about substance
or theater ?

311
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,520
Do you think enough is being done
to battle street gangs in the U.S. ?

312
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,760
Do you trust information from unnamed
sources in the Washington Post ?

313
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,160
Why are cable news channels
airing so much coverage

314
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,880
of the Trump/Russia story ?

315
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,560
So here are the options:
it's bias against the President,

316
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,840
for higher ratings
or it's a really important story ?

317
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,200
There is a clear slant
to those questions and answers.

318
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,200
Can't wait for the inevitable poll:

319
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,600
how would you describe the way
Trump looks in athletic wear ?

320
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,360
A. Adonis-like, B. Herculean,
C. striking for a man of his age,

321
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,800
or D. not my thing
but I'd still hit it.

322
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,440
But perhaps the most troubling
thing is that Sinclair has a daily,

323
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,960
must-run segment
called the Terrorism Alert Desk.

324
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,760
They report on terrorism every day,

325
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,800
whether there is something major
to report on or not.

326
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,680
Sometimes, the updates
contain things like this.

327
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,600
The company in charge of security
for the Wimbledon tournament

328
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,320
says the ringleader
of the London Bridge attack

329
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,000
did apply for a job.

330
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,040
He was not interviewed
and no interview was scheduled,

331
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,200
he filled out an
online application.

332
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,320
An ISIS flag was found hanging
in New Hampshire.

333
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,880
It was taken down and police
are looking into who put it there.

334
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,000
From the Terrorism Alert Desk,
I'm Lindsey Mastis.

335
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,120
In other alerts: my grandma
heard a loud noise,

336
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,160
a man with a beard asked me
when the next bus is coming

337
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,640
and Iran still exists.

338
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,920
From the Terrorism
Alert Desk in Washington,

339
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,920
I am just about done
with this shit.

340
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,280
The Terror Alert Desk has also
featured some terrifying stories.

341
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,360
ISIS has carried out a gruesome
public execution in Iraq.

342
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,800
They sliced 9 teens in half
with a chainsaw.

343
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,080
That caught our attention,

344
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,800
it feels like the sort of thing
we'd have seen reported elsewhere.

345
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,680
We tried to track down that story
and it originated

346
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,560
with an anonymously sourced report
on something called Iraqi News.

347
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,080
We weren't able to find any outlet
that had verified it,

348
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,480
and when it was picked up
by British tabloids and Breitbart,

349
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,120
they distanced
themselves with language like

350
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,520
"it has been claimed"
and "reportedly".

351
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,440
I did not know it was possible

352
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,200
to dip beneath the journalistic
standards of Breitbart.

353
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,760
That's like being too bad a chef
to work at a carnival food cart.

354
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,680
Your fried ham is unimaginative
and bland and we cannot have that:

355
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,280
we're Uncle Sticky's discount
ham wagon.

356
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,560
They reported it like it was a fact
and what was perhaps even weirder

357
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,520
was the story that closed it out.

358
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,320
Mayors in 22 French towns are
ignoring a high court's ruling

359
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,840
that says
banning burkinis is illegal.

360
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,480
30 towns outlawed the swimwear
worn mostly by Muslim women.

361
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,440
From the Terrorism Alert Desk,
I'm Michelle Marsh.

362
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,680
What the fuck ?

363
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,200
That is not about terrorism,
it's just about Muslims.

364
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,280
By that definition, "terrorism
is anything a Muslim does."

365
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,440
Tonight: Mahershala Ali
on the cover of GQ,

366
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,160
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar sneezed
in an airport

367
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,560
and happy birthday
to Fareed Zakaria !

368
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,360
This has been
your Terrorism Alert Desk.

369
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,400
Now to their credit,

370
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,600
some Sinclair stations fight back
against their parent company.

371
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,520
Their station in Seattle, "KOMO",
has engaged in acts of rebellion,

372
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,160
like airing must-runs at
times of low viewership.

373
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,800
Their only airing of the story
about the New Hampshire ISIS flag

374
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,160
was at 4:54 AM.

375
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,440
So it was basically only seen
by people in hospital waiting rooms,

376
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,600
customers at 24-hour
Seven-Elevens and Craig.

377
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:08,160
Just go to bed, Craig ! Get your
shit together and go to bed.

378
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:14,320
If you work at a Sinclair station,
there is so much you can do.

379
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,040
Should this Tribune
acquisition go through,

380
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,840
there are going to be more good
journalists having to see their work

381
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,240
placed alongside
Terror Desk nonsense.

382
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,320
There'll be more unsuspecting
audience members

383
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,880
who'll be getting
a heaping dose of Sinclair's content.

384
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:36,320
Find out who owns your stations
and bear that in mind as you watch.

385
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,800
For any Tribune station
that could soon be taken over,

386
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,080
we've produced a video
so you can alert your viewers.

387
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
Don't think of it
as a "must-run",

388
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,200
think of it more
as a "probably should run."

389
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,720
Hello, I'm Steve Schirripa
from the Sopranos

390
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,760
and I'm probably not
the last guy with an accent,

391
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,880
wearing a cheap tie, that you're
going to see on this channel.

392
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,640
This station could soon be owned
by Sinclair Broadcast Group.

393
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,400
So you might see this
fucking guy, or this fucking logo,

394
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,360
or this fucking desk,
and if you do, just know

395
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,040
that wasn't produced by this station,
because the people at this station know

396
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,360
that local news should never be
about cheap scaremongering

397
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,560
or advancing a political agenda.

398
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,360
It should only be
about weather, sports,

399
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,560
I-Team investigations
and human interest stories

400
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,440
featuring cute animals,
like this potbelly pig.

401
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,200
Look at this little guy.
He's called Pork Chop.

402
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,880
I'm Steve Schirripa telling you,
if this becomes a Sinclair station,

403
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,040
good luck with that shit.

404
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,720
Moving on.
Before we go tonight,

405
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,480
I would like to talk about
America's presidents:

406
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,680
the only group that we know, at some
point, masturbated in the White House.

407
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,200
You think McKinley didn't ?
He's doing it in that photo !

408
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,920
With all the horrors
of our current president,

409
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,960
it can sometimes help to get
historical perspective.

410
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,480
To look at all the people
who preceded him.

411
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,880
A few months ago, one place
where you might be able to do that

412
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,480
was forced to say goodbye.

413
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,600
After 60 years, the Hall of Presidents
and First Ladies Wax Museum,

414
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,560
in Gettysburg,
is shutting down.

415
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,400
You have an opportunity to own
a piece of American history.

416
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,440
Something that doesn't
come up everyday in auction.

417
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,080
Should be a interesting auction
and we hope lots of people come.

418
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,680
So do I ! These wax presidents
deserve a good home !

419
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,480
No one wants to see Benjamin Harrison
having to model culottes at Forever 21.

420
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,920
Here's the thing:
people did come.

421
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,800
Some paid thousands of dollars
to own a wax president.

422
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,000
It turned out there were
some notable buyers among them.

423
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,040
We got
our life-size wax president.

424
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,320
That is President Eisenhower.

425
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,480
Is it ? Is it, though ?
It looks like you may've just bought

426
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,520
a wax sculpture of Bill O'Reilly
covering his erection with a magazine.

427
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,280
It wasn't just Maddow,
Stephen Colbert got one, too.

428
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:32,720
And now, please rise for your
Late Show President, Zachary Taylor.

429
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,640
Congratulations, Stephen ! Taylor died
of a stomach bug 16 months into office.

430
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,640
He's less of a "president"
and more

431
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,440
a "guy named Zach who shit his brains
out in the West Wing men's room."

432
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,880
Colbert wanted Martin Van Buren,
but unbeknownst to him,

433
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,840
Jon Stewart bought that one,

434
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,320
to add to his ever-expanding
mannequin sex dungeon.

435
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,040
That's the only rational explanation.

436
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,120
I know what you're thinking:
spending good money

437
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,760
on a poorly made wax figure
of a former president sounds stupid !

438
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,920
You're right. And that is why
I am proud to say:

439
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,240
we didn't go down there
and buy one of them.

440
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,800
We bought five of them.
Five. Why five ?

441
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,640
Because we are five times
stupider than any other TV show.

442
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,680
We've been sitting on this for so long
is cause we've been busy

443
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,720
constructing a home
for our horrifying new friends.

444
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,120
I'd like to present to you
the Last Week Tonight

445
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,920
Hall of Dubiously Lifelike
Wax Commanders in Chief !

446
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,000
The whole gang is here !
First, there is Richard Nixon !

447
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,840
He cost us $1 900 and he looks
like a store-brand Mitt Romney !

448
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,280
Next there's Bill Clinton or
to be more accurate,

449
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,440
John Travolta in "Primary Colors"
as Bill Clinton.

450
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,560
Then there's Jimmy Carter !

451
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,000
Looking like the "before" photo
for a jaundice medication !

452
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,200
William Henry Harrison who died
of pneumonia 31 days into office

453
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,600
and this is probably exactly what
he looked like when he did !

454
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,640
And lastly there is
Warren G. Fucking Harding !

455
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,720
This one is actually my favorite,
we've talked a lot about Harding.

456
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,640
He was our 29th president,
and his administration

457
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,640
was nearly brought down
by the teapot dome scandal.

458
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,720
He's perhaps most famous
for his sexual exploits.

459
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,440
After Warren Harding died in 1923,
Nan Britton wrote a book

460
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,680
claiming they'd made love
in a White House closet

461
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,560
and he'd fathered
her daughter, Elizabeth.

462
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,360
Knocking up your friend's daughter
in a White House fuck-cupboard ?

463
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,480
You waxy little pervert.

464
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,040
Harding had
an incredible life story.

465
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,000
It's a shame someone hasn't
made a major motion picture of it.

466
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,760
It would have to be someone
with way too much time on their hands,

467
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,440
way too many resources
and unfettered access

468
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,480
to a life-size wax replica of former
president Warren G. Harding.

469
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,240
If only that person existed,

470
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,440
the movie they'd make
might look a little like this.

471
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:34,200
He came from humble roots
to rule a nation.

472
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,600
President Warren G. Harding
as I live and breathe.

473
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,920
Let's show these fancy Washington
folk what an Ohio boy can do.

474
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,720
Mr. Speaker, the President
of the United States.

475
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:03,040
But behind the public face
lived a man of dark ambition.

476
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:09,800
Raise them up to the 29th President
of these United States

477
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,960
and to our very good fortune.

478
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:25,680
Driven by hidden passions beyond
his control, and the realm of virtue.

479
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,280
Mr. Harding. I do believe
you're flirting with me.

480
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,920
Consumed by a lust
that would not weaken.

481
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,560
Take me, Warren.

482
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,960
His name was synonymous
with grace and dignity.

483
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,520
Mr. President.

484
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,720
Doomed to pay
the price of power.

485
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,840
Mr. President
I must ask you again to sign

486
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,920
an executive order
about this Teapot Dome matter.

487
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,600
You will sign this document !

488
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,480
Torn between duty and desire.

489
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,520
I demand to see my Warren.

490
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,960
You are in no position
to demand anything.

491
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,880
How dare
you speak to me this way ?

492
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,800
You look me in the eye and
tell me she means nothing to you.

493
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,680
Don't you
turn your back on me, Warren !

494
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,560
He risked all he held dear.

495
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,600
If you don't contain this situation,
this administration is going down.

496
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,040
We will all be finished !
Sir ?

497
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,920
Is that all I am to you ?
A plaything ? I'm not your whore !

498
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,200
Why must my greatest love
also be my greatest trial ?

499
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,800
The New York Times
calls it "A movieý"

500
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:12,960
The LA Times raves "There are four
Oscar nominees in it. Seriously."

501
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,760
And World of Wax Monthly hails
Hardy as "A triumph."

00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:25,400
Campbell Scott. Anna Kendrick.
Michael McKean. James Cromwell.

503
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,960
And Laura Fucking Linney.

504
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,080
You are a great man,
Warren, but heed my warning.

505
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,360
Even great men
may be corrupted.

506
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,200
So... yeah.

507
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,800
Yeah.

508
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,640
Harding.

509
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,680
Warren !

510
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,320
Did you fall ?

511
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,520
Coming soon.

512
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,800
We don't even know what
we're doing with the other four yet !

513
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,640
That's our show ! We'll be back
on July 30th ! Goodnight !
