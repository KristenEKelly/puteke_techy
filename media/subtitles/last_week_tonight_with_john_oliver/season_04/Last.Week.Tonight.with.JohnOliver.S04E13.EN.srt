LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,240
Season IV
Episode 13

3
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,040
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,400
Thank you for joining us.
We're going to do something different.

5
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,680
Because for one week,
and one week only,

6
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,680
the show Last Week Tonight
is actually going to talk,

7
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,520
at some length,
about the last week tonight.

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,520
And the reason
we have to do that is,

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,400
the last seven days
have been insane,

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,960
so much so that by Friday night,
it may've broken Anderson Cooper.

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,240
Jeffrey Lord, CNN contributor
and die-hard Trump supporter

12
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,400
was in the middle of defending another
indefensible statement from Trump

13
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,280
when Cooper finally snapped.

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,800
He's the president of the US.
If he wants to say that,

15
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,640
Barack Obama wants to say whatever,
if Bush says I looked in his eyes.

16
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,360
If he took a dump on his desk,
you would defend it.

17
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,480
Yes, that is a professional journalist,
saying of the president:

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,920
"if he took a dump on his desk,
you would defend it."

19
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,600
More importantly, Jeffrey Lord
did not immediately answer "no".

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,160
I could devote time to why CNN
would put themselves in the position

21
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,200
of having a professional dump-defender
constantly on their network,

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,240
but there is
not going to be time.

23
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,600
Tonight, we track the latest
developments in "Stupid Watergate",

24
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,560
a scandal with all the potential
ramifications of Watergate,

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,040
but where everyone involved
is stupid and bad at everything.

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,560
Given the exhausting pace
of this week's events, tonight,

27
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,520
we are going to try and answer
a few basic questions:

28
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,560
What the fuck is going on ?
How big a deal is this ?

29
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,200
Where do we go from here ?
And is this real life ?

30
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,760
So, let's begin with question one:
what the fuck is going on ?

31
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,560
And the answer to that is:
"quite a lot".

32
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,640
Can you even remember
how this week began ?

33
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,800
There was a big story on Monday
you may have forgotten by now.

34
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,480
Reports Trump revealed information
to Russians in the Oval Office.

35
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,880
The president was boasting to Russia's
foreign minister and ambassador

36
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,280
when he divulged intelligence during
an Oval Office meeting.

37
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,800
President Trump may've
revealed code word information,

38
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,600
one of the highest levels of
classification, to Russian officials.

39
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,680
That is the information you shouldn't
share with your closest friends.

40
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,120
In Trump's case would be
the golf caddy he calls "Steve"

41
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,080
even though his name is "Doug",
a bucket of KFC chicken

42
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,320
and the ghost of Roger Ailes.

43
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,720
Back then, in the more
innocent time of Monday,

44
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,640
it felt like there simply could not
be a bigger story than that.

45
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,200
This is the most serious charge ever
made against a sitting president.

46
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,600
Let's not minimize it.
Comey is in the wastebasket of history,

47
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,000
everything else is off the table.

48
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,440
This is the most serious charge
ever made

49
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,920
against a sitting president
of the US.

50
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,480
Alan Dershowitz was extremely
wrong about that.

51
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,120
I would say it's hard to imagine him
being more wrong about anything.

52
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,560
Fortunately we have
photographic proof.

53
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,360
But that Russia news was buried
the very next day by this.

54
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,080
ABC News confirming that after
an Oval Office visit in February,

55
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,200
former FBI director James Comey
wrote a memo

56
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,000
saying that during that meeting,
President Trump asked him

57
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,480
to shut down his investigation
into NS Adviser Michael Flynn.

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,120
That was a huge deal. A reminder about
why the FBI was investigating Flynn,

59
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,240
a man
whose overall demeanor says:

60
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,120
"I only fuck on top of the sheets so
I don't ruin the hospital corners."

61
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,320
Flynn was fired after he'd discussed
US sanctions against Russia

62
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,080
with Russian official
during the transition,

63
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,280
despite denying that to the press,
to the FBI,

64
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,520
and to Vice President Mike Pence.

65
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Flynn was so flawed, Team Trump was
repeatedly warned about his baggage

66
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,560
by both then-acting AG Sally Yates
and President Obama,

67
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,960
and even General Flynn himself.

68
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,080
But Trump kept standing
by him anyway.

69
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,720
Which makes sense. Every decision
in the Trump administration

70
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,720
is the worst possible one.

71
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,400
Paper or plastic ? Whichever
one kills the most birds.

72
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,680
Soup or salad ?
I'm gonna go with the n-word.

73
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,440
Favorite Beatle ?
It's got to be Yoko.

74
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:19,000
Let's get back to this week,
on Wednesday, just four days ago,

75
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,040
which is the equivalent of 150 years
in 2017 time,

76
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,720
Trump gave the commencement
address at Coast Guard Academy.

77
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,120
Should've been easy,

78
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,440
lift the cadets' spirits and
point them towards the future.

79
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,360
But Trump used the speech to,
I'm fairly sure,

80
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,760
momentarily forget the word
"certainty" and then also whine

81
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,040
about how mean people
were being to him.

82
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:49,040
No politician in history
and I say this with great surety

83
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,040
has been treated
worse or more unfairly.

84
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,000
Wait: no politician
has been treated worse ?

85
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,680
Abraham Lincoln was shot by an actor.
McKinley was shot by an anarchist.

86
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,640
JFK was, of course, murdered
by Ted Cruz's father.

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,680
James Garfield was shot, then to find
the bullet, and this is true,

88
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,760
Alexander Graham Bell devised
a metal detector which didn't work,

89
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,040
so doctors tried to fish
around in his guts for the bullet

90
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,240
with unwashed fingers,
which made his infection worse.

91
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,040
He died in horrible pain.

92
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,240
But yeah, Alec Baldwin sometimes
does a mean impression of you on TV,

93
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,880
so yeah,
it's basically the same, isn't it ?

94
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:36,360
Then later that same day,
the Justice Department appointed

95
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,080
a special counsel,
former FBI head Robert Mueller,

96
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,400
to conduct an investigation into
the Trump's connections to Russia.

97
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,440
Which is also a massive development
closely followed by Thursday's news

98
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,160
concerning James Comey,
his friend's account of the lengths

99
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,320
to which Comey went
at this post-inauguration meeting

100
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,600
to try and avoid a personal encounter
with the president.

101
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,480
If you watch the video of it,
he's wearing a blue blazer

102
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:09,920
and he stands in the part of the room
as far from Trump as it is possible.

103
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,960
And also against blue drapes that
are the same color as his...

104
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,520
- He chose that spot ?
- Yes.

105
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:24,520
It was like almost like a chameleon,
camouflaged against the wall.

106
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,640
Come on, Comey !
If you're six foot eight,

107
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,080
you don't hide
by blending into a curtain.

108
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,200
You wear a brown suit, you paste leaves
and hope to be mistaken for a tree.

109
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,480
That's what you do.
We somehow escaped Thursday alive.

110
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,160
On Friday, the president took off
for a nine-day overseas trip.

111
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,840
The wheels of Air Force One

112
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,920
had barely left the ground
when this happened.

113
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,160
The New York Times reporting that
according to a White House document,

114
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,480
President Trump in the Oval Office
told Russian officials

115
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,000
that James Comey, the FBI director,
was a, quote, nut job.

116
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,440
That sounds rough,
but in Trump's defense,

117
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,760
I can kind of see
where he's coming from.

118
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,680
The guy keeps hiding in my drapes.
Who does that ? He's huge !

119
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,040
I can see him ! Dress like a tree !
You've got to know that.

120
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,720
That same document, which
the White House did not deny,

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,040
gave the even more concerning detail
that Trump told his Russian guests:

122
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,320
"I fired the head of the FBI. I faced
great pressure because of Russia."

123
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,880
"That's taken off."

124
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,720
It's almost difficult
to believe your ears

125
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,720
when you hear something
so audaciously corrupt.

126
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,720
It's like if Hillary Clinton had sent
an email with the subject line

127
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,120
"Sup ? I did Benghazi".

128
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,320
Wait, because the week
still wasn't quite yet done.

129
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,280
Almost at the exact same time
that the nut job news emerged,

130
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,720
there was one last
startling revelation.

131
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,720
Washington Post began reporting
that the FBI investigation

132
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,560
into possible coordination with Russia
and the Trump campaign

133
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,440
identified a current official
as a significant person of interest.

134
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,400
That is also potentially enormous.

135
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,440
Some suggested could be
Jared Kushner, but it seems unlikely.

136
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,320
While he is technically significant
and legally a person,

137
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,440
he in no way qualifies
as "of interest".

138
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,680
He is the least interesting
human on Earth.

139
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,720
He is the person equivalent of
an empty room painted "eggshell".

140
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,760
He's like a white bread sandwich,

141
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,520
where the middle is
a third slice of white bread.

142
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,600
Or, as Mike Pence refers to
that, "the devil's hoagie".

143
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,440
That is the shortest summation
of the events of this week.

144
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,080
Which brings us to our second
question: how big a deal is this ?

145
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,880
Because it feels
like a pretty big deal.

146
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,120
There were already multiple
investigations into Russia's efforts

147
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,160
to swing the election and any possible
ties to the Trump campaign.

148
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,840
But there are now also strong
allegations that Trump attempted

149
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,200
to influence the investigations.

150
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,960
We now have a special counsel
looking into all of this.

151
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,120
You would have to be trying
hard not to see this as a big deal.

152
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,240
Nobody tried harder than some
commentators on FOX News.

153
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,360
This is insane, where is
the evidence of a crime ?

154
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,840
People are buying this lunacy.

155
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,120
Hysteria every single day.

156
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,960
- We've reached madness.
- They're unhinged.

157
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,920
This is a scandal with no video,
with no audio, with no sex,

158
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,720
with no money, with no dead
bodies, it's a boring scandal !

159
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
That is just ridiculous.

160
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,960
"There may be Americans
hidden in plain view,"

161
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,480
"working on behalf of Russia"
is not boring,

162
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,600
it's literally a Emmy
nominated TV show.

163
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,520
But perhaps my favorite attempt
to pour water on this story

164
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,160
came from Tucker Carlson,
the villain from a direct-to-video

165
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,200
"Caddyshack" sequel
who became a real boy.

166
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,720
Tucks tried to Jedi-mindtrick
this scandal out of existence.

167
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,280
The world is a complicated place,
Washington especially.

168
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,640
What you think is happening
often isn't happening.

169
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,160
What you think
is happening isn't happening.

170
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,920
He's talking like a parent whose kids
walked in on them sixty-nining.

171
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,000
This isn't what you think !
This isn't what you're looking at.

172
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,840
Your mother and I were just
listening to see

173
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,440
if there's an echo
when you scream into a butt !

174
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,000
Nothing is happening here !
You're not seeing anything here !

175
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,640
Although fascinatingly,
as the week went on,

176
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,680
even some on Fox were struggling
to hold the line.

177
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,240
Remember
Mr. "This Is A Boring Scandal" ?

178
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,480
This was him just two days later.

179
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,680
I've been the first one to say

180
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,320
there's a lot of smoke
but I don't see any fire.

181
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,480
I'm getting concerned. Even I,
myself, have gotten to the point

182
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,840
where I'm like what is going on
here with this situation ?

183
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,880
That cannot be a good sign.

184
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,680
A Fox host not being able to hold
his doubts at bay for 48 hours

185
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,920
is a canary in a coalmine.

186
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,520
At this point, Trump
is waist-deep in dead canaries.

187
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,120
You can tell how serious
this is becoming by the fact

188
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,640
that members of Trump's own party
were suddenly hard to find.

189
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,280
We've reached out to 20 Republican
senators and representatives.

190
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,320
We've reported and requested
that someone from White House join us

191
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,960
at any point
to respond to the latest news.

192
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,160
All declined our invitation.

193
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,120
Think about how crazy that is.
Twenty invites, twenty refusals.

194
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,880
That's worse attendance than a wrap
party for the cast of The Jinx.

195
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,760
I don't know, Bob, where do you
think everyone is, you massive creep ?

196
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,600
Some Republicans did comment
on Trump this week,

197
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,280
but not perhaps in the way that
the White House would've wanted.

198
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,480
John McCain had this to say.

199
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,240
It's reaching the point where
it's of Watergate size and scale

200
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,960
and a couple of other scandals
you and I have seen.

201
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,000
It's a centipede and
the shoe continues to drop.

202
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,680
It's like a centipede
that keeps dropping shoes.

203
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,400
But it's real.
And people wear shoes.

204
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,080
So the Trump administration is more
like a human centipede,

205
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,920
in terms of the amount of shit
passing through it

206
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,320
and how nauseating
watching it really is.

207
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,640
While McCain was willing
to cite Watergate,

208
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,400
other Republicans
were willing to go further.

209
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,400
Michigan's Justin Amash
became the first Republican to say

210
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,320
the president's actions
might merit impeachment.

211
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,240
A member of Trump's own party
raised the specter of impeachment

212
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,640
just four months
into the president's first term.

213
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
That is almost impressive in a way !
And it gets worse.

214
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,080
Because when Mother Jones ran
an article citing Amash

215
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,840
as the first Republican
to mention impeachment,

216
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,400
a spokeswoman for another Republican,
Representative Carlos Curbelo,

217
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,880
reached out to say he was
the first Republican to mention it.

218
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,440
To be completely fair here,

219
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,000
the very first person to think
"God, he should not be president"

220
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,000
is probably some unnamed
nurse in Queens in the year 1946.

221
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,240
I've been doing this a long time,

222
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,440
but this baby
is the worst one I've ever seen.

223
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,320
This is a terrible baby.

224
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,160
The specter of impeachment

225
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,760
is something that some in
the White House are taking seriously.

226
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,480
After days of incendiary headlines,
CNN learned that White House lawyers

227
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,240
are researching what a possible
Trump impeachment might look like.

228
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,440
That's actually
a pretty good question.

229
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,560
Ironically, I imagine
at least part of it would involve

230
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,320
thousands of Muslims
celebrating in New Jersey.

231
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:22,360
So this has all the appearances
of a pretty big deal.

232
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,160
Which brings us to question number
three: where do we go from here ?

233
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,200
If you are hoping for impeachment
or a resignation,

234
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,480
take a quick peek at the presidential
line of succession.

235
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,200
Trump going would be fantastic. But
that would give us President Pence.

236
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,960
Look how our prospective
next president sees himself.

237
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm a Christian, a conservative
and a Republican, in that order.

238
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,600
I'm a Christian, a conservative,
a Republican, in that order.

239
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,240
I'm a Christian. A conservative.
And a Republican. In that order.

240
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,160
I would have loved it
if he'd just kept going after.

241
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,760
I'm a Gemini, I'm a furry, and
gluten-intolerant in that order.

242
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,920
That's what I am.
Those 6 things. Don't get it wrong.

243
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:10,160
Mike Pence led efforts
to defund Planned Parenthood,

244
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,120
he opposed the Lilly Ledbetter Act
and the end of Don't Ask, Don't Tell,

245
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,280
championed an amendment defining
marriage as between man and woman.

246
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,720
As Governor,

247
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,520
his accomplishment was the passage of
the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,

248
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,320
which could have made it easier

249
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,880
for religious conservatives
to refuse service to gay couples.

250
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,840
When he was asked multiple times
whether that's what it did,

251
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,120
he kept dodging the question,
ending in this exchange.

252
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,240
Do you think it should be legal
in the state of Indiana

253
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,720
to discriminate
against gays or lesbians ?

254
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,200
It's a yes or no question.

255
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,640
Hoosiers don't believe
in discrimination.

256
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,440
I don't believe in Hoosiers !
What the fuck is a Hoosier ?

257
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,240
Where does that term
come from anyway ?

258
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,160
It sounds like the sound Al Pacino
makes when he sneezes.

259
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,000
By the way,
if you tell yourself:

260
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,000
maybe Trump's impeachment
could take Pence down,

261
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,920
think about
what that would mean.

262
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Then we'd have
President Paul Ryan,

263
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,640
three words that I always
knew I'd have to say,

264
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,520
but I didn't expect
to have to say it quite so soon,

265
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,640
like remember polar bears ?

266
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,280
Or female Entourage reboot.

267
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,640
The boys are back, and this time...
they're girls.

268
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:41,720
Let's say that Ryan is also sitting
on his own impeachable clusterfuck.

269
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,440
Do you know who is next in line
to the presidency ?

270
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,840
You might not. I'm not sure
that you do, do you ?

271
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,240
It's actually Mr. Kelsey Grammer.

272
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,640
You're probably assuming,
correctly, that that is wrong,

273
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,960
but what is the real
right answer there ?

274
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,560
We would genuinely have
President Orrin Hatch at that point.

275
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:07,520
He would be president, a man whose
every expression says:

276
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,000
"I take fiber supplements
and frankly they're not working."

277
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,240
Hatch is his own separate
kind of nightmare,

278
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,800
but before we get lost any
further down this paranoid wormhole,

279
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,160
let's just all take
a collective breath.

280
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,280
In reality, even though some people
have been getting excited this week,

281
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,680
impeachment is a long shot
for many reasons,

282
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,960
it would require a majority of
the House to vote to impeach

283
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,840
and that is currently
controlled by Republicans,

284
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,960
it would need two-thirds of the Senate
to vote to convict the president

285
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,200
and it is also controlled
by Republicans right now.

286
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,480
So the likelihood is that Trump
will continue as president.

287
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,240
Which shouldn't really be
a surprise to anyone.

288
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,720
Why would this be the end
of the line for him ?

289
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,280
Trump seemed to reach the end
of the line on multiple occasions,

290
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,920
only for nothing to happen.

291
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,920
Remember when he hesitated
to disavow David Duke ?

292
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,480
Wasn't that supposed to be
the end of the line ?

293
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,920
Or the time he bullied
a gold-star family ?

294
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,200
That had to be the end
of the line, right ?

295
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,840
Or the Access Hollywood tape ?
We thought the next stop on that bus

296
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,640
was, you guessed it,
the end of the fucking line.

297
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,680
Seems like, when it comes
to President Trump,

298
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,080
he's always approaching the end,
but it never seems to come.

299
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,680
As if for him alone, the end of line
is drawn by MC fucking Escher.

300
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:34,040
I know following stupid Watergate's
every development

301
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,480
can be all-consuming.

302
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,440
It feels like nothing else has happened
over the last couple of weeks.

303
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,160
That is dangerous to believe because
things have happened.

304
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,480
This administration has made
significant moves.

305
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,320
Jeff Sessions moved
to lengthen drug sentences,

306
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,040
undoing Obama-era
criminal justice reforms.

307
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,920
Tonight, it came out that Trump
is going to propose

308
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,840
slashing Medicaid
and other safety-net benefits.

309
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,640
In court, the administration may
decide to end Obamacare subsidies

310
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,640
which could unravel
the Obamacare insurance markets.

311
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,880
So that 1946 nurse
was absolutely right,

312
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,880
he was the worst baby
and he's still the worst baby now.

313
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:23,040
As if all of this wasn't bad enough,
which it comfortably is,

314
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,360
we are getting glimpses
into how this president operates.

315
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,800
We learned that this is how
his own national security team

316
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,160
feels they have to brief him
on important global issues.

317
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,200
He likes single page memos,
maps, charts, graphs and photos.

318
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,840
NSA officials have included
Trump's name in, quote:

319
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,000
"as many paragraphs as we can 'cause
he keeps reading if he is mentioned."

320
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,880
That is absolutely pathetic.

321
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,960
Our president can only
understand the world

322
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,240
to the extent
that it involves himself.

323
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,160
It is possible that his security
briefing reads:

324
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,800
the leader of North Trump,
Kim Jong Trump,

325
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,840
is making an intercontinental
ballistic Trump.

326
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,440
This could seriously jeopardize
not just the region.

327
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,640
Also the safety of millions
of... God, we're losing you !

328
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,960
Trump, Trump, Trump.
Welcome back, sir.

329
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,480
This can all seem
like a terrible work of fiction.

330
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,960
Which actually brings us
to our final question.

331
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,040
Is this real life ? To which
the answer is, unfortunately, yes.

332
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,880
If you are feeling miserable about
the situation we're in,

333
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,360
the only consolation
I may offer you is,

334
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,440
I'm not sure that Trump
is entirely happy, either.

335
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,560
You've seen him enjoy the rallies
and the attention

336
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,200
and the fact that he can say
he's the president.

337
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,200
The most telling photo taken
of him so far is this one.

338
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:56,880
That was taken on his inauguration day,
at a luncheon thrown in his honor.

339
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,640
Look at his face. He looks like
he's at the funeral for every dog.

340
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,600
If you think I'm projecting
this onto him,

341
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,320
listen to an interview Trump gave
at the 100-day mark of his presidency

342
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,360
and tell me if this is a guy
who sounds like he's happy.

343
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,840
I loved my previous life... This is
more work than my previous life.

344
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,840
I thought it would be easier...
I do miss my old life.

345
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,600
I like to work, that's not a problem,
but this is actually more work.

346
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,280
Of course being president
is harder than your old job.

347
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,400
Of course it is. Your old job
was basically having a name,

348
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,120
letting other people pay you to use
that name, and firing Dee Snider.

349
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,920
It was fucking easy.
Although I will say this:

350
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,680
I have something in common
with Donald Trump.

351
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,640
I, too, preferred my previous life
before he became president.

352
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:00,240
That is why this is truly
stupid Watergate.

353
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,880
We are in for an agonizingly long
period of leaks, allegations

354
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,120
and recriminations, all over
a presidential campaign

355
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,400
to put a man in power, who may
not entirely want to be there.

356
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,520
Say what you want about Nixon,
at least he wanted the fucking job.

357
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,640
I don't know about you,
but this week has drained me.

358
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,040
At the end of last year, we told you
to write down this is not normal,

359
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,920
to guard yourself
against getting complacent.

360
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,680
I don't think there is much danger
of that happening in the future,

361
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,040
but it is also worth remembering
that sentiment to reassure yourself

362
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,800
that you're not going crazy.

363
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,440
And if you are tempted to believe
that this is all politics

364
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,960
and every president goes through
a week like the one that we just had,

365
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,920
let me show you why people were
attacking the last president for,

366
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,120
at the same point
in his first term.

367
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,320
President Obama
is a real man of the people.

368
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,520
Take a look at him ordering his burger
with a very special condiment.

369
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,200
You got like a spicy mustard,
a Dijon mustard ?

370
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,360
I hope you enjoyed
that fancy burger, Mr. President.

371
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,560
They were really mad about that !
That was on actual television !

372
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,320
I would give anything to once again
live in a time when the scandal

373
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,240
rocking the executive branch
was a Fox News host

374
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,560
implying that the president
likes metrosexual mustard.

375
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,920
And maybe, fingers crossed,
one day, we can all get there again.

376
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,640
And now, this.

377
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,880
Another look at whatever the fuck
is happening on WCBS 2 News at 11.

378
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,800
Bye-Bye Bunions, tonight at 11.
Grooming the Groom.

379
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,800
The Better Bread, tonight at 11.
Filthy Fare, Face Cupping,

380
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:49,880
Drunkorexia, Decision Fatigue,
Inside A Big Rig, The Road Reader,

381
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,560
High-Tech Chores, High Tech
Looking Glasses, The Body Hack,

382
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,080
Living Dead, Shocking the Habit,
Exploding Sunroofs,

383
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,800
Pets: The Dental Dilemma,
Smell Dating. Tonight on CBS 2 News.

384
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,440
While you're sleeping these kids
are playing. Why ? Tonight at 11.

385
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,000
Now before we go
we have a bit of a problem.

386
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,080
You may have noticed Trump
has decimated this week.

387
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,960
In doing that, he's destroyed
our plans for this show.

388
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,880
We wanted to give you one
of our usual deep dives

389
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,840
into an extremely
boring topic.

390
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:31,200
We'd chosen the TSA. There is not
enough time left to do it, properly.

391
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:36,120
I'm gonna give you a full
Last Week Tonight story

392
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,680
that should take twenty minutes
in just three minutes.

393
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,640
Are you ready ? There's
no time for that, let's go.

394
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,120
Our main story tonight
concerns the TSA.

395
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,200
The only people who worry more about
what's stuck up your butt than you do.

396
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,560
There are problems, potential
solutions, and it's more complicated.

397
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,000
This graph goes up,
this graph goes down.

398
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,760
In combination,
that's clearly a real problem.

399
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,840
This woman believes TSA techniques
are an invasion of her privacy.

400
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,960
It's an invasion of my privacy.

401
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,320
That's not how
that word is pronounced.

402
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,080
Then I was going to show you
victims of inappropriate TSA conduct,

403
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,120
and hit you with a clip
involving Muppet penguins.

404
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,400
1, 2, 3, 4, penguins
that went by the door.

405
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,640
That made sense
in the context of our piece.

406
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,040
Penguins are a flightless bird,
so if they wanted to go somewhere,

407
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,320
they might have to deal
with the TSA...

408
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,920
Imagine the fun graphics
we had planned.

409
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:38,920
Here's one of Trump with a penguin.
Going to break down TSA procedures.

410
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,440
Sensitive areas like the breast,
groin and buttocks.

411
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,240
All three are funny,
but we would be placing them

412
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,240
next to a story where that
clip would actually be sad.

413
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,480
How long we got ? Ninety seconds ?
Shit.

414
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,560
We're gonna skip this clip,
this clip, and this clip.

415
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,880
That woman is the TSA chief.
No time to get into what she's saying

416
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,800
but just enough time to show you
this graphic of Putin and Boris Yeltsin

417
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,480
giving each other handjobs,

418
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,840
it would've made
some sense in context.

419
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,200
We had this TSA cartoon for you.

420
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,040
It looks kind of scary.

421
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,520
No time for a joke there.

422
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,800
We were also going to spend time
with the TSA's Instagram account !

423
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,760
Here is an actual picture
where someone asked them:

424
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,520
are knife-nanas allowed ?

425
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,800
Knife-nanas ? We're not supposed
to joke about knife-nanas ?

426
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,440
We also don't have time for
this graph,

427
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,360
and this graph is actually a bigger
problem than you might think...

428
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,000
And this is the part where I have
to say, to be fair...

429
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,920
And read what the TSA said about
an incident that I was going to mention

430
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,640
and they say, we conducted
a thorough review...

431
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,080
I don't have time for this.
Then I was going to say 48 percent,

432
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,200
41 out of 50 states,
4.8 billion dollars and 9 000 dollars,

433
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,640
which is a lot and to show you we
were going to use the GDP of Moldova.

434
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,640
Twenty seconds left ?
Here's three pullquotes,

435
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,640
the second of which involves
twenty tons of cocaine.

436
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,480
An elephant snorting cocaine.

437
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,600
I was gonna reach my conclusion,
which we do not have time for.

438
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,600
To cheer everyone up at the end
of a long and depressing show,

439
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,360
we were going to give you something
fun to watch, the penguins !

440
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,280
The penguins were
gonna cheer us up !

441
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,600
I guess they still can !
Look, penguins ! It's just nice.

442
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,080
Things are allowed to be nice.

443
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,560
Write your congressman about
the issues you've seen discussed !

444
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,600
Can you do that thing where you
laugh with your mouths ?

445
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,800
That's one of my favorite
things in the world !

446
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,400
Enjoy it now and forever.
That's our show, we're off next week,

447
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,680
we're back on June 4th,
thank you for watching, good night !

448
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,440
We've got penguins !

449
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,160
Penguins !

450
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,480
It's penguins !
It's just fun. It's just some fun.

451
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,960
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

452
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,720
END OF EPISODE 13,
SEASON IV
