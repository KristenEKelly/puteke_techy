LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,560
Season IV
Episode 15

3
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,920
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,720
I'm John Oliver. Thank you
for joining us, let's dive straight in

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,760
with the latest installment in what
we're calling "Stupid Watergate".

6
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,320
Something with all the potential
national shame of Watergate,

7
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,920
brought to you by people too stupid
to grasp the concept of shame.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,160
Former FBI director and worst person
to sit behind in a movie theater,

9
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,280
James Comey,
got everybody's attention.

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,520
Striking revelations and allegations
from James Comey.

11
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,480
Under oath, telling Congress
he has no doubt

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,280
he was fired because of
the Russia investigation.

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,680
Dramatic, but the notion that Comey
was fired because of the investigation

14
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,960
isn't actually new or controversial.

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,280
It is easy to forget,
but Trump suggested as much

16
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,200
in an interview just a month ago.

17
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,360
It's more a known fact that many
choose to ignore,

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,720
like "a pet snake
is a character flaw"

19
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,480
or "DJs aren't doing
anything up there."

20
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,640
Comey, the result of a mall security
guard's drunken hookup with an oak,

21
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,600
did testify before the Senate
Intelligence Committee,

22
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,920
and he had forcefully addressed
Trump's initial excuse for firing him.

23
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,120
Saying that the organization
was in disarray, poorly led,

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,600
the work force had lost
confidence in its leader.

25
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,280
Those were lies, plain and simple.

26
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,200
Hold on.
Let's be honest here.

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,080
Donald Trump's lies are never
plain and simple.

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,320
Each one is like an
everlasting gobstopper.

29
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,400
You'll never make it through
every layer, it's produced

30
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,080
by a lunatic
who shouldn't be in charge.

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,080
Willy, oompah loompahs
shit in the chocolate river

32
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,520
and you'll leave your estate to the
only child you didn't nearly murder.

33
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,760
You have no business
running a factory.

34
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,640
That was one of many times Comey
questioned president's credibility.

35
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,000
Listen to the reason Comey gave

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,040
for taking detailed notes
on his meetings with Trump.

37
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,920
I was concerned he might lie
about the nature of our meeting

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,680
and so I thought to document.

39
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,880
He's describing his meeting
with the president

40
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,920
like a person who thought
he was about to be murdered.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,480
All of a sudden we were alone,
so I texted my location to a friend

42
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,480
and tried to get some of his DNA
under my fingernails !

43
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,840
It is a good thing that Comey,
a disgruntled giraffe,

44
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,720
who was somehow cursed by
a warlock to head the FBI,

45
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,440
did take notes, because some of his
encounters with the president

46
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,680
got pretty weird.

47
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,160
Like the infamous dinner where
Trump asked for his loyalty.

48
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:11,680
How unusual is it to have
a dinner with the president ?

49
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,320
Did that strike you as odd ?

50
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,280
Yeah. I assumed
there would be others,

51
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,000
that he couldn't be
having dinner with me alone.

52
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,360
He was tricked into a one-on-one
dinner with Donald Trump,

53
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,680
which is not the first time
that has happened.

54
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,200
Comey is lucky that Trump didn't try
the hole in a bucket of popcorn trick.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,360
Let's all admit: it is better to have
a dinner alone with Trump

56
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,880
than have Jared Kushner there too,
just staring at you silently

57
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,640
with his creepy, dead eyes.

58
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,760
Is that you, Jared ?

59
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,560
I thought you were a painting of an
orphan from the Great Depression.

60
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,520
The most tantalizing moments
may turn out to be the things

61
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,080
Comey didn't, or wasn't able
to say, like in this exchange.

62
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,360
Do you believe Donald Trump
colluded with Russia ?

63
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,080
That's a question I don't think
I should answer in an open setting.

64
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah, I can't answer
that question here.

65
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,200
I have been screaming the word 'yes'
in this paper bag the last four weeks,

66
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,160
which I can submit as evidence
to the committee if required.

67
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,000
I will need to be
provided with a new scream bag.

68
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,040
Comey declining to answer doesn't
mean there's anything there,

69
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,320
he could just be operating
out of an abundance of caution.

70
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,280
There was a moment
he seemed to hint at something new.

71
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,200
It came when discussing the FBI's
lack of surprise at Jeff Sessions

72
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,080
recusing himself
from the Russia investigation.

73
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,560
Our judgment was that he was close
to and inevitably going to

74
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,440
recuse himself
for a variety of reasons.

75
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,480
We also were aware of facts
that would make his engagement

76
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,840
in a Russia-related
investigation problematic.

77
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,920
That sounds like a big deal.

78
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,840
If someone asks you if you've ever
had sex with a turtle, and you say:

79
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,440
"there are facts about that I can't
discuss in an open setting",

80
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,920
the answer is "yes"

81
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,680
and the closed setting you'd prefer
to discuss it in is Eggslist.com,

82
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,600
a message board for finding freshly
hatched turtles to have sex with.

83
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,120
Comey's testimony appears
damaging for the White House.

84
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,600
Even Fox News was struggling
to spin any positives.

85
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,160
Politically, it was very damaging
to the president.

86
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,080
I am concerned
after hearing Jim Comey today.

87
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,360
It was far stronger, more credible
and more damning than the statement

88
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,120
we got from Comey yesterday.

89
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,840
This sort of brings home the question
of the president's credibility,

90
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,920
which is always a big loss.

91
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,280
That is not good.
Although at this point,

92
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,960
saying something "damaged
Trump's credibility" is like saying

93
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,520
"that graffiti is a real eyesore
on that pile of dead pigeons."

94
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,080
As for the president himself,
he was silent the day of the hearing,

95
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,000
but sent a tweet the next
morning that began:

96
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,000
"despite many false statements and
lies, total and complete vindication."

97
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,960
Think about what he's saying.
Trump is claiming he's been vindicated

98
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,400
by testimony
he's claiming is false.

99
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,160
At this point, he's become
a walking logical paradox.

100
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,200
I honestly wouldn't be surprised
if he just starts tweeting:

101
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,600
"I traveled back in time
and killed myself. Very unfair !"

102
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,360
And in a press conference,
Trump reiterated his claim

103
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,600
that Comey had lied, which
prompted an obvious question.

104
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,440
Would you speak under oath
to give your version ?

105
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,800
100 percent.

106
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,280
So if Robert Mueller
wanted to speak...

107
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,120
I would tell him exactly
what I just told you, Jim.

108
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,520
Holy shit. Trump just
volunteered to testify under oath,

109
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,480
putting himself in a situation where
it's his word against Comey's.

110
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,600
For all the pushback Republican
senators gave Comey,

111
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,000
they never once questioned
his honesty and his integrity

112
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,600
or challenged his characterization
of Trump as a liar.

113
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,760
Why did Trump seem to expose
himself like that ? I don't know.

114
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,600
I cannot explain. Jane Goodall
could not explain his behavior.

115
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,560
She could watch Trump for a decade
and eventually conclude:

116
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,840
I think it's a cocktail of insecurity,
horniness, and malice,

117
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,840
but which is in control
of which is beyond me.

118
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,960
I miss the integrity and emotional
intelligence of the apes.

119
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,160
But perhaps the most infuriating
response came from Paul Ryan,

120
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,000
who proves that you can live a
normal, healthy life without a spine.

121
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,880
Ryan's explanation was pathetic.

122
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,160
The president's new at this.
He's new to government

123
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,560
and so he probably wasn't steeped
in the long-running protocols

124
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,360
that establish the relationships
between DOJ, FBI, and White Houses.

125
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,320
There are so many problems
with what he just said,

126
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,200
but there are undeniably times when
the excuse "he's new to this" is fair.

127
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,840
If you work at a daycare
and on your first day

128
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,040
you mix up the three Olivias,
no big deal, you're new here.

129
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,720
But if on your first day,
you set up a baby fight club ?

130
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,200
That is not okay, and you should've
known that before you started.

131
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,840
A president attempting
to shut down an investigation

132
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,800
into a subordinate is pretty
firmly the latter option here.

133
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,760
You want their supervisors
to look into that,

134
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,400
even if the first rule of baby fight
club is that you cannot talk about that

135
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,880
in an open setting.

136
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,760
And now this.

137
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,480
There is no group
of people more easily amazed

138
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,520
than the audience
of "America's Got Talent".

139
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,360
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns the United Kingdom.

140
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,240
The country that's been saying
"yas, queen" for centuries.

141
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,040
We've been
saying it for centuries.

142
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,840
Yas, queen.

143
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:07,640
The UK held a national election. There
wasn't due to be one for three years,

144
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,360
but Prime Minister Theresa May
called it early.

145
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,040
It's called a snap election, she
did it to consolidate her power.

146
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,000
It didn't quite work out
that way.

147
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,040
A disaster for
the UK prime minister tonight.

148
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,520
Theresa May's Conservatives
suffering a stunning setback.

149
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,880
Her goal of securing a stronger hand
for Brexit negotiations backfired.

150
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,240
The snap general election
ended with a hung parliament.

151
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:38,520
Yes, this was a clusterfuck or
a crumpetfuck of epic proportions.

152
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,280
Theresa May, to stay in power,
she's attempting to cut a deal

153
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,320
with DUP, an anti-gay, anti-abortion
party in Northern Ireland,

154
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,960
which has opened her up
to even more criticism.

155
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,760
There are rumors of a leadership
challenge from within her party,

156
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,160
by Boris Johnson, a grown man
who looks like a 7-year old

157
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,640
who's spun in circles for two minutes
and is about to throw up.

158
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,240
While Theresa May did win re-election
in her own constituency,

159
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,520
even that came
with some humiliation.

160
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,080
British politics has a proud tradition
of having all candidates

161
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,480
standing together on the stage
when results are announced,

162
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,000
even joke candidates.

163
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,320
On election night, as her party
was dealt a massive blow,

164
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,080
the prime minister, here, had to stand
onstage alongside Elmo,

165
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,920
who got 3 votes,

166
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,840
as well as Howling Laud Hope of
the Monster Raving Looney Party,

167
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,840
who got 119 votes.

168
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,960
And, if you've noticed this guy,
wait till you hear his name.

169
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,320
Lord Buckethead... 249.

170
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,240
You can roll your eyes
all you like, Theresa.

171
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,200
Your evening found a way
to get a lot worse.

172
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,680
Lord Buckethead is this guy,
an "intergalactic space lord"

173
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,400
who ran on a platform of,
among other things,

174
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,600
"the abolition of the lords,
brackets, except me",

175
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,600
and "stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia.
Start buying lasers from Buckethead."

176
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,400
He did this while looking like Darth
Vader fucked an Amazon Echo.

177
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,640
What I'm saying is, British politics,
when done well, can be very fun.

178
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,560
So how did Theresa May suffer
such a setback in an election that

179
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,360
she was predicted
to win in a landslide ?

180
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,400
She ran a campaign
full of mistakes, flip-flops

181
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,520
and uninspiring
moments like this.

182
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,320
What's the naughtiest thing
you ever did ?

183
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,760
Goodness me.
I suppose the...

184
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,760
I'm not quite sure.

185
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,640
When me and my friends used
to run through the fields of wheat,

186
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,280
the farmers
weren't too pleased.

187
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,720
The naughtiest thing you've ever
done is run through a wheat field ?

188
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,160
I cannot imagine a scenario
when that is ever naughty

189
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,000
unless you're doing it while high
on PCP and fucking a cantaloupe.

190
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,960
One of the beneficiaries
of the election was May's opponent,

191
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,120
Jeremy Corbyn.

192
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,720
He and Britain's Labour Party
outperformed expectations,

193
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,400
despite taking some rough
treatment from the British tabloids.

194
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,720
An impressive
performance for Corbyn,

195
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,800
undercut by one awkward moment
with a fellow party leader.

196
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,880
Mr. Corbyn was beaming as he arrived
at his own count in Islington,

197
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,800
though his high-five with Thornberry
went a touch too far perhaps.

198
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:52,400
That's not ideal.
A celebratory moment,

199
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,000
followed by history's most catastrophic
rounding of second base.

200
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,080
I do not agree with Theresa May
on the vast majority of issues.

201
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,440
The tone of some of the coverage
surrounding her setback

202
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,360
was more than a little sexist.

203
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,120
The face of Theresa May,
the look of a woman defeated,

204
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,520
heavily made up
as if she'd been in tears earlier.

205
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,200
Her voice cracking at times.

206
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,000
I can recognize the look
of a woman defeated.

207
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,760
It's the one my female colleagues give
me any time I tell them to smile more.

208
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
Back to you in the studio, Angela.

209
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,840
That's the exact expression
I'm referring to.

210
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,160
Cheer up, old girl,
you look absolutely miserable !

211
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,720
The whole point of May
calling this election early

212
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,240
was to strengthen her hand
going into Brexit negotiations.

213
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,000
And though it has done
the exact opposite of that,

214
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,360
let's take a look at what those
talks are going to involve.

215
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,320
Talks are set to begin
a week from tomorrow

216
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,400
and they need to be completed
by March of 2019,

217
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,760
which is not a lot of time
to do something important

218
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,600
and incredibly complicated.

219
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,640
Britain wants out of the EU.

220
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,320
But we've been in for more
than forty years,

221
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,480
with our systems becoming
more tangled up with each other.

222
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,800
We only have two years to
hammer out a divorce deal.

223
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,920
It's true, this is going to be
a messy, complicated divorce.

224
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,960
Try and think of it this way:

225
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,120
imagine if Florida wanted
to secede from the union.

226
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,600
Nice, right ?

227
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,120
Think about everything
that that would entail:

228
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,320
Florida has a border with Alabama
and Georgia that would need patrolling.

229
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,720
Florida goods going over that
border, like oranges or meth,

230
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,920
would likely be subject to tariffs.

231
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,760
You'd need to decide whether Floridians
would be welcome in the U.S.

232
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,720
or Americans
welcome in Florida.

233
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,960
That's before you get into the question
of who'd take custody of Hulk Hogan ?

234
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,400
Florida and the U.S. splitting up would
be an immensely complicated process.

235
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,120
It's a great idea, and we should
do it, but it wouldn't be easy.

236
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,240
Brexit is going to be more difficult
and more expensive, too.

237
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,240
A so-called divorce bill
needs to be negotiated,

238
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,680
where the UK settles financial
commitments that they made,

239
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,400
and some estimates put that
as high as 100 billion euros.

240
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,480
And that's just the beginning.
Broadly speaking,

241
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,480
the question is whether the UK
will have a hard or a soft Brexit.

242
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,560
That is a concept that British
TV has attempted to explain,

243
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,440
sometimes in the most
ludicrous fashion.

244
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,120
The options range from a harder
Brexit to a softer Brexit.

245
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,760
What better way to judge peoples'
political taste than through cheese ?

246
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,440
Hard... or soft ?

247
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,320
What ?

248
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,040
What better way to judge people's
political taste than through cheese ?

249
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,040
Off the top of my head:
literally all other ways.

250
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,720
Even Buzzfeed would find

251
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,560
"tell us what cheese you like and we'll
tell you what Brexit you want"

252
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,880
to be too stupid
for one of their quizzes.

253
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,040
And they've run the actual quizzes:
"should you stick this up your butt ?"

254
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,360
And "which Olsen twin are you ?"

255
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,720
We addressed last week,
there is only one Olsen twin.

256
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,000
It's a gigantic conspiracy.
You're being lied to.

257
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,520
I just don't know why yet.
But anyway, put that aside,

258
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,080
that report
had useful information in it,

259
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,560
if you can ignore the fact it is
pointlessly written on cheese.

260
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,640
A harder Brexit would see
the UK leave the single market.

261
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,720
UK would then trade
with the EU under WTO rules.

262
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,280
We'd have more of a say over borders
so we could control immigration.

263
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,960
A softer Brexit would see the UK
remain part of the single market.

264
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,000
There'd be continued
free access for EU nationals.

265
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,680
But Britain's exports wouldn't be
subject to border checks.

266
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,840
That's a pretty decent explainer.
Although I really must insist,

267
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,000
that cheese
is distractingly weird.

268
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,560
The only time cheese should be
used as a framing device

269
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,640
is if you are a mouse couple
posing for wedding photos.

270
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,000
And even then,
it's a little Pinteresty.

271
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,840
It's never a bad idea to
ask yourself:

272
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,800
if you somehow
couldn't Instagram your wedding,

273
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,880
would you still be
getting married ?

274
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,480
Within that hard-soft framework
are decisions that will affect lives.

275
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,800
Take immigration. There are currently
3 million EU citizens living in the UK

276
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,720
and 1.2 million British citizens
living in Europe.

277
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,120
All wouldn't mind knowing
where they'll be allowed to live

278
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,960
and what their rights might be,
in two years' time.

279
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,080
The issue of Northern Ireland,
which is part of the UK

280
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,720
and will therefore Brexit.

281
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,480
But, the Republic of Ireland
is part of the EU.

282
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,800
Any effort to start policing the border
between them will be difficult,

283
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,560
there is a long, painful history
of tensions on the subject.

284
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,200
The idea of border checkpoints
splitting communities again

285
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,280
could quickly become a nightmare.

286
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,120
This is a huge, delicate problem,
which one news report illustrated

287
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
in the most
whimsical way possible.

288
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,440
Pip the dog goes on a brief excursion
to the Republic of Ireland.

289
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,800
And returns to the United Kingdom
just as easily.

290
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,280
This dog had no license
to cross the border

291
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,360
so he'll have to go to jail,
he's an illegal immigrant.

292
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,920
Yes, that is an objectively silly way
to illustrate an important issue.

293
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,640
I'm not sure there is a better
metaphor for the British Empire than

294
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,200
a jolly chap named Pip shows
fuck-all respect for a border.

295
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,800
This bit of land here is mine.
And this one too.

296
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,280
And this part is
very fun to play around in.

297
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,320
We haven't even got to the most
difficult issue, trade.

298
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,840
Pulling out of the EU's single market
without striking a favorable trade deal

299
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,240
could expose UK
products to high tariffs.

300
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,040
That is worrisome for farmers,

301
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,200
since around two-thirds of the UK's
agricultural exports go to the EU.

302
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,400
Not to mention, the significant EU farm
subsidies that would be lost.

303
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,240
No wonder
the farmers are concerned.

304
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,320
Andrew Baugh's family
have farmed here since 1947.

305
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,760
If we leave without a trade deal,
he'll be badly hit.

306
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,240
We'd have a job to export
things because of the tariffs,

307
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,960
particularly with something
like these sheep,

308
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,320
a third of all lambs
need to be exported.

309
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,560
The whole food industry,
I believe, is at risk.

310
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,520
We're gonna have a rub now.
That's what we do in life.

311
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,480
Could they have cut out before
the pig started grinding on that post ?

312
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,960
Yes, but they didn't
because they knew:

313
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,960
that twerking pig may be the perfect
embodiment of the Brexit situation.

314
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,520
It's in motion already,
we're all powerless to stop it

315
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,560
and it is impossible
to look away.

316
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,920
As for how the British economy will
fare outside of EU trade agreements,

317
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,080
that is also unclear.

318
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,920
Some argue that things could work out
great and that no matter what,

319
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,800
British products are so desirable,
they will find eager customers.

320
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,480
And maybe that's true !
Maybe pork pies, Marmite, mushy peas

321
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,600
and undiagnosed clinical depression
will all take the planet by storm.

322
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,240
That is technically possible. But there
is a massive amount of work to do.

323
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,480
UK will need to decide which EU laws
it'll choose to keep,

324
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,480
from workers' rights to
environmental protection.

325
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:29,120
It'll also likely need to set up
its own regulatory agencies.

326
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,720
And it may also need
to negotiate new treaties

327
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,840
to replace the 759 EU-brokered
deals that it will be excluded from,

328
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,600
governing everything
from wine to nuclear power

329
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,200
to the 1981 bilateral agreement
with Iceland

330
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,000
concerning the trade of sheep meat
and goat meat.

331
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,400
Any single part of Brexit
is a mountainous task

332
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,160
and that is before you get
to the tiny little bit

333
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,000
that you haven't even
thought might be a problem.

334
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:01,040
250 000 dogs and cats go across
the British channel every year.

335
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,720
Trying to work out
how the pet passports work,

336
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,280
that would take
months of negotiation.

337
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,680
He's right, they've even have to work
out the issue of pet passports.

338
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,440
While they are a genuine
logistical concern,

339
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,600
pet passports sound like they
belong to real asshole cats and dogs.

340
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,400
Technically I'm a Persian,

341
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,560
but I consider myself more
a citizen of the world.

342
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,800
Fuck you, Muffin. You still use
your mouth to clean your butt.

343
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,680
You're not better than me !

344
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:38,640
The Brexit deal with the EU needs
to be finalized within just two years.

345
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,680
If you think: what if they
don't get it done ?

346
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,880
This happens.

347
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,440
If there's no deal, that leaves
only one option: the cliff edge.

348
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:55,280
The cliff edge describes the reality
of one day being in the EU,

349
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,480
with everything that that means,
and the next day being out of it.

350
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,280
There is one instance in which
the stock footage

351
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,320
of an old-timey car flying off
a cliff is appropriate for news,

352
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,960
and you've just witnessed it.

353
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,560
Because if there is no deal,
everything from tariffs to immigration

354
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,640
would default
to the harshest possible scenario,

355
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,360
which could destabilize
the entire country.

356
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,320
In theory, they could get
an extension on the negotiation.

357
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,680
That would require all 27 EU
members to approve it.

358
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,040
I would not rely on that happening.

359
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,960
EU has a vested interest in making
this negotiation difficult,

360
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,200
because however much they
may value the UK as a partner,

361
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,880
they need to dissuade any other
countries from pulling out.

362
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:49,360
EU is taking a firm line.
After the Brexit vote, Boris Johnson,

363
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,080
a man with the face of
a Roald Dahl character

364
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,800
and the uncomfortable racism
of a Roald Dahl,

365
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,360
claimed that our policy is having
our cake and eating it.

366
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,920
Watch EU President Donald Tusk
dismantle that idea.

367
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,200
To all who believe in it,
I propose a simple experiment.

368
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,480
Buy a cake, eat it, and see
if it is still there on the plate.

369
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,600
There will be no cakes
on the table. For anyone.

370
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,040
There will be only
salt and vinegar.

371
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,800
Nothing but salt and vinegar.
That is some tough talk.

372
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,400
Someone should tell him that British
people love salt and vinegar.

373
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,040
Look at all of our variations
on salt and vinegar crisps.

374
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,240
Threatening the British by saying
there will be only salt and vinegar

375
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,600
is like threatening the French:
there will only be wine and baguettes

376
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,960
or threatening the Swiss: there
will only be chocolate and Nazi gold.

377
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,000
Those are their two favorite things !
They like those, equally.

378
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,840
UK faces a daunting task. The pound
has suffered since the Brexit vote

379
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,200
and Theresa May seems to have
weakened her position,

380
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,880
making it harder for her
to enact her plan.

381
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,640
It wasn't clear what that plan was
in the first place.

382
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,720
While she seems to favor
a hard Brexit,

383
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,200
she could be maddeningly
evasive when asked for specifics.

384
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,120
People talk about the sort of Brexit
that there is going to be,

385
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,240
actually, we want a red,
white, and blue Brexit.

386
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,200
That is the right Brexit
for the UK.

387
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,160
But what does that mean ?
You're heading into a negotiation

388
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,080
that will set the course
for Britain for generations

389
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,720
and you're naming colors
on the fucking flag.

390
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,720
Forget running through fields of wheat,
that may be the most ridiculous thing.

391
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,600
I apologize to that guy
from before.

392
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,680
I said there was literally no worse way
to discuss this than with cheese,

393
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,400
but I was not counting on Thatcher
in the Rye here

394
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,680
answering a policy question
with a fucking color scheme.

395
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:07,160
Her vagueness
did not go unnoticed.

396
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,120
In fact, it is not a great sign
that the single most honest statement

397
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,360
from any candidate in this election
regarding the difficulty of the task

398
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,640
came from a man with
a two-foot bucket on his head.

399
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,840
Your prime minister, your MP,
Theresa May,

400
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,040
called this election about Brexit.

401
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,040
Have we heard from her what
she plans to do about Brexit ?

402
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,320
No ! This is mad.

403
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,560
On Thursday you are going to be faced
with Prime Minister May

404
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:47,520
or Prime Minister Corbyn against
27 prime ministers from the EU.

405
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,920
It will be a shit-show.

406
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
You know what ?

407
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,960
I never thought I'd say this, but that
intergalactic space lord has a point.

408
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,560
The UK is set to walk in a negotiation
with no real leverage,

409
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,760
no significant political mandate
and no coherent plan.

410
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,040
I don't really have a solution.
But I have a proposal for Theresa May.

411
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,680
'Cause at this point, you have
basically fucked everything up.

412
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,320
Your only real chance here
is to utilize the element of surprise.

413
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,320
So how about instead
of sending a career negotiator,

414
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,600
why not send someone that there is
no way they would expect ?

415
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,080
I'm talking about someone bold,
unafraid to call it how it is.

416
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,200
Someone with a firm,
leather-clad grasp of the issues.

417
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,840
Someone with a bucket list
of demands,

418
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,920
and an honest,
slightly muffled voice ?

419
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,720
I'm talking about the intergalactic
space lord himself.

420
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,520
Here is the question: is he willing
to do it ? Well, yes, he is.

421
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,280
And the reason I know that,
is we found him, contacted him

422
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,360
and actually flew him here
to New York this morning.

423
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,240
Could we have just made a similar
costume and put an intern in it ?

424
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Yes, shit, we could have done
that. That's a good point.

425
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,320
But we didn't.
And the fact that we didn't

426
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,120
is why I am now able to
present to you here tonight,

427
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,760
your new Brexit negotiator,
Lord Buckethead.

428
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,720
That's right:
on your knees, earthlings.

429
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,080
Theresa May, if you are still prime
minister by the time this show airs,

430
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,600
I implore you:
send the dark lord to Brussels !

431
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,040
Is it an absurd idea ? Yes.
But it would not even be close

432
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,720
to the stupidest
thing that you have ever done !

433
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,600
Thank you for watching,
we'll see you next week, good night !

434
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,320
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

435
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,600
END OF EPISODE 15,
SEASON IV
