LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,480
Season IV
Episode 30

3
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,040
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,800
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us,

5
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,400
we have time for a lightning-quick
recap of the week,

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,920
from Republicans continuing
to roll out their tax reform plan

7
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,240
with the grace of a horse
falling down a spiral staircase,

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,320
to the New York Times reporting
Louis CK's gross sexual misconduct.

9
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,320
Which is indefensible,
and resulted in the cancellation

10
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,400
of his new film
"Exhibit A If This Ever Goes To Trial."

11
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,000
As for the president,
he's been overseas all week,

12
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,120
which should've been relaxing for us,
until this happened last night.

13
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,560
President Trump openly mocked
the leader of North Korea.

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,480
"Why would Kim Jong Un
insult me by calling me old,"

15
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,240
"when I would never call him
short and fat ?"

16
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,600
This would be the stupidest
reason for all of us to die.

17
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,720
If the entire country simultaneously
tripped while putting on its underwear

18
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,240
and fell face-forward into the toilet,
got stuck and drowned,

19
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,200
it would be less stupid than if that
tweet caused a nuclear apocalypse.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,800
Rather than focus
on the events of this week,

21
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,360
we thought we'd actually take
a broader look at the topic

22
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,320
that has dominated this past year:
the presidency of Donald Trump,

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,000
the man voted "least edible" by
Cannibal Magazine six years in row.

24
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,000
I know that the prospect of talking
about Trump again feels exhausting.

25
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,280
Every room in America should have
a sign on the wall that counts

26
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,000
the number of minutes since
someone brought up his name.

27
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,120
Trump's presidency is like
one of his handshakes.

28
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,040
It pulls you in
whether you like it or not.

29
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,960
He has had so many terrible moments,
you probably forget many.

30
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,160
Remember he told French president's
wife she was in "good shape" ?

31
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,200
Or when his golf resort was touted
on the State Department website ?

32
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,320
Or when he shoved
the prime minister of Montenegro

33
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,440
out of the way at a NATO event ?

34
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,400
Look how proud of himself he is !

35
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,240
You should at least have to know
that Montenegro is a country

36
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,320
before making a move that says:
"suck it, Montenegro !"

37
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,640
Also quieter,
no less alarming moments,

38
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,440
like when he explained how hard
he's been fighting

39
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,640
to bring "clean coal" back, without
appearing to understand what that is.

40
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,040
It's just been announced
that a second, brand-new coal mine

41
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,040
where they're going to take out clean
coal, meaning they're taking out coal.

42
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,400
They're gonna clean it...
Is opening in Pennsylvania.

43
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,240
Is it possible that Trump is versed in,
and is referring to,

44
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,520
flue-gas desulfurization,
fluidized-bed combustion

45
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,640
and selective catalytic reduction ?

46
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,160
It's possible. But let's agree
it's more likely that he thinks

47
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,000
you just take a bunch of coal and
scrub-a-dub it with a big old sponge.

48
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,960
I'm saying the president

49
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,680
doesn't understand
what he's talking about.

50
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,280
You know what that means ?

51
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,320
We got him !

52
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,840
I've got him.
I did not get him ?

53
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,480
I thought we got him.
I thought we got him that time.

54
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,680
All right, that's fair.
You think I don't hate myself too ?

55
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,280
The point is, tonight,

56
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,480
let's pull back from the daily
Trump-induced chaos

57
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,800
and take a look at the norms
his presidency has violated.

58
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,240
Not the obvious ones,
like he never released his tax returns

59
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,800
or that his own daughter and
son-in-law work in the White House,

60
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,000
I am using the word "work"
so generously

61
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,000
that I should be able to deduct it as
a charitable donation on my taxes.

62
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,840
Instead of putting assets in a blind
trust to reduce conflicts of interest,

63
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,080
he showed America he has
many large stacks of paper,

64
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,720
presumably containing the sentence

65
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,560
"I can't believe I'm getting away
with this" printed 750 000 times.

66
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,960
No. We're going to talk about Trump's
assault on something more basic:

67
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,280
the norms governing
how our leaders engage with us,

68
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,120
and how in turn, that affects the way
we engage with one another.

69
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,240
It's why the notion of "getting him"
can feel so hopelessly futile.

70
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,480
It doesn't help that, often, what Trump
says is complete nonsense.

71
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,520
We read transcripts
of Trump's speeches

72
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,800
and it's something that everyone
should do once in a while.

73
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,640
When you strip away his blindly
confident, entertaining delivery

74
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,720
and just read his words, it is
staggering how incoherent he is.

75
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,160
Here is a word-for-word reading
of a speech about Iran nuclear deal.

76
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,760
Look at the nuclear deal,
the thing that bothers me...

77
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,920
Would've been easy, not
as important as these lives are.

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,800
Nuclear is powerful, my uncle explained
that to me years ago, the power

79
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,080
35 years ago, he would explain
of what's going to happen

80
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,800
and he was right...

81
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,920
When you look
at the four prisoners,

82
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,640
it used to be three, now it's four
but when it was three and even now,

83
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,360
it's all in the messenger.

84
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,680
They haven't figured the women are
smarter right now than the men,

85
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,080
so, you know, it's gonna
take them about another 150 years.

86
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,920
Persians, great negotiators,
Iranians also,

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,560
so, and they just killed,
they just killed us.

88
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,960
Holy shit. That is not
a functional use of language.

89
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,760
That is a drunk driver crashing
a pickup truck full of alphabet soup.

90
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,240
Trump's actual speech patterns
sound like when you write a long text

91
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,080
by choosing only the predictive text
your iPhone suggests for you.

92
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,720
We wrote a message like that,
starting with the words "the nuclear",

93
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,360
and here is what we got.

94
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,000
Nuclear test program was
not opposed by other person

95
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,800
who knows what they want and
delay is not being done

96
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,640
by other country, it's
not the only way to make sure

97
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,000
world can do more things and
things like that and gentlemen

98
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,880
and the others who have
been told to leave them alone

99
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,800
with their children
who are sad.

100
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,840
That makes exactly as much,
and potentially more sense,

101
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,920
than Trump's speech
about the Iran nuclear deal,

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,760
meaning an iPhone would be a more
coherent president of the US !

103
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,800
With Trump, we are familiar enough
with his speech patterns

104
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,800
that you get the basic gist
of what he's trying to say.

105
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,840
The real damage
isn't in how he says things,

106
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,120
but from three key techniques he uses
to insulate himself from criticism.

107
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,120
And if we are not extremely
careful, all three could have impacts

108
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,960
that far outlast his presidency, and
let's start with the first one:

109
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,640
delegitimizing the media.

110
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,560
Trump has been attacking the press
since he declared his candidacy,

111
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,080
he's been waging war
on the concept of truth

112
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,000
ever since he first turned
to his mom and said "Dada",

113
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,960
she said: "no, I'm Mama", and he
said: "fake news !" and shit his pants.

114
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,160
He's crying fake news
as president of the United States

115
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,640
and he is openly proud of it
to the point that he recently tried

116
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,760
to take ownership
of the term itself.

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,800
The media is, really the word,

118
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,960
I think one of the greatest of all
terms I've come up with is "fake".

119
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,520
Other people have used it, perhaps,
but I've never noticed it.

120
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,920
He just took credit for inventing
the term "fake news", which he did not.

121
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,800
Meaning what he just said
was technically fake "fake news" news.

122
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,520
You could imagine him saying: "I'm
not the first to criticize the press."

123
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,440
What about Hillary Clinton,
Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders ?

124
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,080
That brings us to Trump's
second technique,

125
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,200
something called "whataboutism".

126
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,800
It's changing the subject to someone
else's perceived wrongdoing.

127
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,320
Trump does this all the time,
most famously when he was asked

128
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,560
why he hadn't condemned the
Neo-Nazis in Charlottesville

129
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,160
and this was his response.

130
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,520
What about the alt-left that came
charging at the alt-right ?

131
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,720
Do they have any guilt ?

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,760
What about the fact that they came
charging with clubs in their hands ?

133
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,960
Do they have any problem ?

134
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,400
Actually, no. Because a Nazi killing
someone with a car is so heinous

135
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:46,920
and the other issues that might be up
for debate have to wait their turn.

136
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,320
You can be wearing Crocs with socks,

137
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,240
but if you're using those socked Crocs
to kick Hitler in the balls,

138
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,720
I'm suddenly not so fucking
focused on the footwear.

139
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,480
Now this technique
of saying "what about ?"

140
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,240
is actually an old
Soviet propaganda tool,

141
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,880
and it is dangerous because it implies
that actions, regardless of context,

142
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,040
share a moral equivalency
and since nobody is perfect,

143
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,280
criticism is hypocritical and everybody
should do whatever they want.

144
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,440
It is a effective tool, which is why,

145
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,520
on Trump's favorite network,
you hear it all the time.

146
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,440
Mainstream media focused on Trump
campaign and collusions with Russia.

147
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,680
But what about the Democrats'
possible ties to Moscow ?

148
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,360
General Michael Flynn investigated
for his private meeting with Russia,

149
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,280
but what about Hillary Clinton ?

150
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,800
The media wants to call into question
the credibility of this administration.

151
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,760
What about Benghazi, the lies
the Obama administration told us ?

152
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,560
What about the fact that Ben Rhodes
bragged about lying to the media

153
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,880
about the Iran deal ?

154
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,360
What about that Jonathan Gruber
said the American people were stupid ?

155
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,960
Okay, stop ! None of the errors
those people may have made in the past

156
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,640
excuse the Trump
administration's actions.

157
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,680
A defense attorney could not
stand up in court and say:

158
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,040
maybe my client
did murder those people.

159
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,640
But I ask you this: what
about Jeffrey Dahmer ?

160
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,240
What about Al Capone or the guy
from "The Silence Of The Lambs" ?

161
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,840
I rest my case here, people.
I rest my case.

162
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,840
The problem with whataboutism is

163
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,600
it doesn't actually solve
a problem or win an argument.

164
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,880
The point is to muddy the waters,
which can make the other side mad.

165
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,680
That brings us to Trump's third
technique: trolling.

166
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,840
Trolling itself
has been around for years,

167
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,120
it's basically 80 percent
of what happens on the internet.

168
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,080
It's when a YouTube commenter says
something willfully provocative,

169
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,320
like saying I've "aged like
an apple core in a dumpster"

170
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,320
or that I "look like
a fucking pickle with glasses".

171
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,480
It doesn't matter
whether they mean any of that,

172
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,840
the point is just to get a reaction
and to hurt my feelings,

173
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,000
which by the way:
it absolutely does.

174
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,760
Trump may well be the first-ever
troll to be elected president.

175
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,200
I said "elected". Remember,
10th president Sprinkles Fuzzwizard ?

176
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,560
He assumed office after
William Henry Harrison died.

177
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,840
If you're thinking Sprinkles Fuzzwizard
was not America's 10th president.

178
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,640
Really ? Who was
America's 10th president ?

179
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,800
Exactly. Let's assume I'm right.
The point is, as a troll,

180
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,600
Trump often does things
that have no effect,

181
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,240
other than to piss off
his perceived enemies.

182
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,240
Like when he tweeted this wrestling
gif of himself bodyslamming CNN,

183
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,240
or attacked Mika Brzezinski by saying
she was bleeding from a face lift,

184
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,160
or called a leader with nuclear
weapons short and fat.

185
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,760
Trump even once retweeted a claim
that he was the most superior troll

186
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,440
on the whole of Twitter,
calling it "a great compliment !"

187
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,280
Which it is not. When you do something
that makes a lot of people mad,

188
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,280
it's because, and bear with me here,
you're a dick.

189
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,200
If you sneak into someone's house
and urinate in every heating vent

190
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,080
you're not an epic troll sticking it
to the snowflake cucks.

191
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,200
You're just some fucking asshole.

192
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,680
Trump's trolling is not actually
without political value.

193
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,000
Despite Trump's few real
policy accomplishments to date,

194
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,760
he has achieved one thing,
making his enemies unhappy.

195
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,640
For many Trump supporters,
that counts as a major victory.

196
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,640
Listen to how "Fox and Friends" reacted
after Trump freaked people out

197
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,160
by standing with military leaders,

198
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,840
suggesting that it was
the "calm before the storm".

199
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,000
- I think he's trolling the media.
- He is totally trolling the media.

200
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,320
Even the smile and the wink ?

201
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,840
The forgotten men and women
who voted for Trump,

202
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,880
want that town to freak out,
those reporters going:

203
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,440
"What do you mean ?"
It's beautiful to watch.

204
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:05,840
Is it ? Why ?
Who benefits from mass confusion

205
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,440
about whether or not
we're about to go to war ?

206
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,800
Are there unemployed
factory workers in the Midwest going:

207
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,480
"The plant closed down,
I lost my healthcare,"

208
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,480
"but a Washington Post
reporter is scared of dying."

209
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,440
"So things are looking up. MAGA !"

210
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,600
Judging your political success on
how bad you make other people feel

211
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,440
makes just about as much sense
as judging your success as a zookeeper

212
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,080
by how many bears you fuck.

213
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,120
That is not your job !

214
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,440
I guess it's impressive
in its own way,

215
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,080
but it's not what
you're supposed to be doing.

216
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,360
The surest proof of trolling often
comes when a troll is confronted.

217
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,160
That's when they have
to put up or shut up.

218
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,880
You heard cases
where people tracked down

219
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,920
the source of something awful
that was posted online,

220
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,440
only to find some sullen 15-year-old
who just shrugs and goes:

221
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,120
"I dunno why I wrote that.
Stop asking me so many questions."

222
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,880
That is our president now.
I'll show you.

223
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,600
Trump said that Obama
surveilled him in Trump Tower, tweeting:

224
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,080
"How low has President Obama
gone to tap-p-p my phones" ?

225
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,000
Watch what happened
when he was asked to justify that.

226
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,160
You saw what happened
with surveillance.

227
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,520
- That was inappropriate.
- What does that mean, sir ?

228
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,680
- You can figure that out yourself.
- You called him "sick and bad".

229
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,160
You can figure it out yourself.
He was very nice to me with words,

230
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,400
but after that,
there has been no relationship.

231
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,480
- You stand by that claim ?
- I don't stand by anything.

232
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,040
Take it the way you want.

233
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,960
So let's walk through
what just happened there:

234
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,960
on Internet he claimed his predecessor
committed a serious crime.

235
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,320
But in person, he is backing down,

236
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,640
first saying Obama was "very
nice to me with words",

237
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,800
then that
"I don't stand by anything."

238
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,880
Which is one of the most nihilistic
sentences a president can say.

239
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,480
I would honestly rather hear that
from a clown holding a knife

240
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,000
than a president, because
at least when a clown says that

241
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,440
you think: "That kind of makes sense.
Please make it quick."

242
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,360
It gets worse,
that interview kept going

243
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,920
and Trump was given the opportunity
to set the record straight

244
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,640
for the "fake news" media,
but he flat-out refused.

245
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,440
I wanted to find out, though.
You're the president of the US.

246
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,320
- You said he was "sick and bad".
- You can take it any way you want.

247
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,960
But I'm asking you. Because you don't
want it to be fake news.

248
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
- You don't have to ask me.
- Why not ?

249
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,240
I have my own opinions.
You can have your own opinions.

250
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,200
I want to know your opinions.
You're the president.

251
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,920
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

252
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,680
Okay, so there is a lot
that is infuriating about that clip,

253
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,480
but Trump going back to his desk
and pretending to work hard

254
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,760
is a funny thing to do.

255
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,480
Like your dog avoiding questions
by pretending to do his taxes.

256
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,720
You never do this ! Why would
you need to do it now ?

257
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,000
While there is nothing new
about these techniques,

258
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,040
they are coming out of the Oval Office,
which not only legitimizes them,

259
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,920
it risks them spreading
and that, sadly, is happening.

260
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,480
Congressman Paul Gosar
used all three techniques.

261
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,160
He suggested the march
in Charlottesville may have been

262
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,520
a false flag operation created by
the left, a pretty troll-y behavior.

263
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,000
When confronted,
he deployed the other two tools.

264
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,320
- It's all been debunked.
- Absolutely not debunked whatsoever.

265
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,800
Your conspiracy theory
has been debunked.

266
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,080
It has not been debunked.
Look at what CNN has talked about

267
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,320
with what's going on with the Clinton
administration with the dossier.

268
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,520
Hardly an aspect in regards
to debunked. You're fake news.

269
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,600
Everything you've said has been
debunked, why are you continuing ?

270
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,400
Fake news.

271
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,880
So he's just copying Trump.

272
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,920
If there is one thing
worse than something terrible,

273
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,280
it's a cover band
of that terrible thing.

274
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,720
If Trump is Nickelback,
that man is Bicklenack.

275
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,200
Not as good at it as the original, and a
horrible sign the disease is spreading.

276
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,320
If that becomes the level of discourse,
we are seriously and lastingly fucked.

277
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,680
This week, we saw some of these
techniques pushed to the limit

278
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,240
by the scandal involving
Alabama senate candidate Roy Moore,

279
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,880
who denied allegations of sexual
misconduct with a 14-year-old

280
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,240
when he was 32
and called them "fake news".

281
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,840
Watch Sean Hannity use whataboutism
to derail a discussion about it.

282
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,320
This 14-year-old girl purportedly,
according to the Washington Post,

283
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,480
told two of her girlfriends
what happened in real time.

284
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,560
You think Bill Clinton,
in retrospect, was a predator ?

285
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,840
But that is not
what this discussion is about.

286
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,760
Might as well have said:
"here's a tough question:"

287
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,680
"if you had to guess,
how many lobsters are there ?"

288
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,520
"Like, total. In the world"

289
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,960
Is that worth discussing ? Sure !
But first let's finish talking about

290
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,640
the senate candidate who may've
made sexual advances on a child.

291
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,400
Whether Clinton engaged
in predatory behavior

292
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,280
is a legitimate question,

293
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,160
but it shouldn't really inform
what we do about Roy Moore.

294
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,920
Even if you believe the Democrats
are guilty of a double standard,

295
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,920
the solution is not to have
no standard whatsoever.

296
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,720
That is why it's so important
to train to identify these techniques,

297
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,720
because their natural endpoint
is the erosion of our ability to decide

298
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,920
what's important, have an honest debate
and hold one another accountable.

299
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,240
That erosion can be so gradual
that it's difficult to spot.

300
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,880
It's like being murdered by a sloth:
it happens very slowly

301
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,440
and you might not notice
until it's too late.

302
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,920
This is all very bleak.
I cannot pretend that it isn't.

303
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,120
Which is why it is important to take
hope from this year's small victories.

304
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,360
Like the Muslim ban being blocked,
after massive public protests.

305
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,240
Or the attempts
to repeal Obamacare stalling,

306
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,320
thanks in part to people
pressuring their lawmakers.

307
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,320
In Virginia, voters rejected
Ed Gillespie for governor,

308
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,120
after he ran a Trump-style
dogwhistle campaign.

309
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,240
Encouraging.
It's nice to know that,

310
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,960
if you use Trump's tactics in
a Virginia gubernatorial election,

311
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,800
you do not get to be gubernator.

312
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,360
Further down the ballot there,
Tuesday also marked the defeat

313
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,640
of Bob Marshall, who earlier this year
proposed a so-called bathroom bill.

314
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,040
He lost to Danica Roem,
who will now be

315
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,920
Virginia's first openly
transgender legislator.

316
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,200
And the tone that she has taken
is already markedly different.

317
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:07,880
Danica, you were running against
Robert Marshall, a 13-term incumbent.

318
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,160
He's also a man who referred to
himself as Virginia's chief homophobe.

319
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,520
He refused to debate you.
Anything you want to say to him ?

320
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,360
Come January, delegate Marshall
will be one of my constituents.

321
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,760
I'm not gonna disrespect
my own constituents.

322
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,000
That is incredibly refreshing.
Just think about that.

323
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,280
She beat a man
who openly disrespected her,

324
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,360
but she chose "not" to respond,
by tweeting:

325
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,680
"I'll fight for Bob's right
to use any bathroom he wants,"

326
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,280
"but it's too late: he already
shit the bed on election day, sad !"

327
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,240
It's nice not to have that.

328
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,560
Tuesday's results
should not make you complacent.

329
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,000
They are no guarantee that the
midterms will turn out at all well.

330
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,720
You should take these moments of
encouragement to help you keep going.

331
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,400
Trump presidency is a marathon,
it's painful, it's pointless

332
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,280
and the majority of you
didn't even agree to run it,

333
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,000
you were just signed up
by your dumbest friend.

334
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,080
We're not even at mile 6 right now
or possibly even mile three,

335
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,400
so there is a long way to go.

336
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,320
Though you're exhausted, and your body
is screaming for you to give up

337
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,520
and your nipples are chafing,
stakes are too high for us to stop.

338
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,200
I'm saying that as we're about
to stop doing shows for the year.

339
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:37,000
We won't be going away entirely.
You may remember, earlier this year,

340
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,040
we used our catheter cowboy
to get information to the president

341
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,160
in the ad breaks of "Fox & Friends".

342
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,200
Trump is still watching that show.
We know this because the Times wrote

343
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,880
a generally negative piece about
its enormous influence on him,

344
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,040
and called it the "most
powerful TV show in America."

345
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,120
A sentiment that the hosts
were very excited about.

346
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,000
The program you're watching
is, according to "The New York Times",

347
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,040
the most powerful TV show
in America.

348
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,200
Do you know why ?
Because we have the best viewers.

349
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,960
No. No, you don't.
You absolutely don't.

350
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,320
Don't misunderstand.

351
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,360
I'm not saying
that we have the best viewers.

352
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,800
No, I'm not saying that.
No, I'm explicitly not saying that.

353
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,120
You guys are fine.

354
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,800
The best audience belongs to Ellen.
Because this is how they greet her.

355
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,840
Here she is now, Ellen DeGeneres.

356
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,400
None of you fuckers
did that when I came out.

357
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,800
None of you did it.

358
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,720
Just 45 minutes after that information
was on Fox, Trump tweeted:

359
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,560
"The failing 'New York Times'
said about 'Fox & Friends',"

360
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,080
"the most powerful TV show
in America."

361
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,120
Information goes right from
that show into his brain,

362
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,560
which is terrible.

363
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,840
We would genuinely be better off
if Trump was getting daily briefings

364
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,640
from an actual fox and his friends,
a hedgehog and a weasel

365
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,560
with its head stuck in a tin can.

366
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,120
But if Trump is going to
keep watching that show,

367
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,520
we'll sneak information
through our catheter cowboy.

368
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,800
A number of commercials are going
to be airing on Fox News

369
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,480
over the next few months,
here is the first one.

370
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,280
Attention, patients.

371
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,920
I'm a professional cowboy,
I use catheters:

372
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,680
I don't like pain when I cath,
and the term "clean coal" doesn't refer

373
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,600
to the physical act of cleaning coal,
that would be impossible.

374
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,000
Coal is coal.

375
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,720
"Clean coal" is a marketing term
the coal industry came up with

376
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,040
for carbon capture and sequestration,

377
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,680
an expensive process that's
shown limited results, at best.

378
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,120
Also, Frederick Douglass is dead.
More tomorrow, bye bye !

379
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,880
That's good information for him.
That will be on Fox in the DC area.

380
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,520
Keep an eye out for more, that
cowboy has got a bunch up his sleeve.

381
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,720
The U.S. Virgin Islands has a governor,
not a president.

382
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,400
Here's a fun fact: there's actually
no federal law against this

383
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,360
thanks to something called
the First Amendment.

384
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,680
Just because Jared Kushner is smarter
than you doesn't mean he's smart.

385
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,320
The Navy Seals aren't seals.
I know. I was disappointed too.

386
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,840
There are many non-gold décor
schemes that are very appealing.

387
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,080
During an eclipse, don't do this.

388
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,520
Buddy, this can't be that hard.

389
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:59,240
Nazis bad.
One fish, two fish, red fish,

390
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,440
arm of the executive branch that should
operate free from interference

391
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,400
so as to avoid politically
motivated prosecution.

392
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,360
Donald ? Donald.
I don't think he's getting any of this.

393
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,560
That's all for now, Donald,
see you tomorrow.

394
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,040
If you're not enjoying this,
there's no shame in quitting.

395
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:29,040
Before we go,
as this is our last episode of the year,

396
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,400
we wanted to thank you for watching,
we have had a lot of fun.

397
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,160
We didn't just cover Trump,
we transformed this desk into a bistro

398
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,280
for our piece
on the French election.

399
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,240
I met the Dalai Lama
and gave him a calculator watch.

400
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,080
We introduced you
to the Bolivian traffic zebras,

401
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:48,800
and you used our green screen version
to put it in "Mad Max: Fury Road",

402
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,280
"Basic Instinct", filling
the White House press room with them.

403
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,880
Thank you so much
for taking part in that.

404
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,720
We also had Weird Al
sing a song about North Korea.

405
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,680
We had penguins, alligator statues,
lobster supreme court justices,

406
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,600
we bought five wax presidents
and put one of them

407
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,720
in a movie
with Laura fucking Linney.

408
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:15,200
We stole Alex Jones's business model
and sold million-dollar taint wipes.

409
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,200
We out-mugged Ajit Pai with
this glorious monstrosity right here,

410
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,320
and most importantly, we exposed
the Olsen twin for the fraud she is,

411
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,080
one person moving very quickly
to trick the human eye.

412
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:36,000
We actually invited "them"
to be on the show tonight,

413
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,520
to prove me wrong, but apparently,
"they" couldn't make it.

414
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,760
And as far as I'm concerned, that is
tantamount to an admission of guilt,

415
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,720
so I'm going to make it official.

416
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,640
We got her !
The truth feels so good !

417
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,760
There's a few people that would love
to come out and say goodbye to you.

418
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,880
They're all here: the Cowboy !
The Zebra ! Mr. Nutterbutter !

419
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,480
And Doctor Throup is here
with an incredible offer for you !

420
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:09,960
You can get 90 percent off the moisture
armored tactical assault wipe !

421
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,440
90 percent off ! So that is
just $100 000 ! That's all !

422
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,080
It's one hell of a deal !
And remember:

423
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,080
they're only to be
applied in this area, right here.

424
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,800
- Apply with vigor and confidence.
- Thank you so much, doctor !

425
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,800
Please, call me "doctor" !

426
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:32,080
Good point. The penguins
are here, ladies and gentlemen !

427
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,040
Thank you so much for watching
and thank you to all our staff.

428
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,240
We'll be back in February.
See you next year, good night.

429
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,640
The penguins !

430
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,720
Sir, the world is in trouble.

431
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,640
We need you. The fate
of humanity itself is at stake.

432
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:50,440
Will you help us, Mr. President ?

433
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,600
I knew we could count on you.
But I'm afraid this isn't a one-man job.

434
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,680
We need all of you.

435
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,120
Mr. President.

436
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,040
Mr. President.

437
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,200
Mr. President.

438
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,200
Mr. President.

439
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,320
Gentlemen,
let's go wax these bastards.

440
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,960
Coming 2018.

441
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,600
END OF EPISODE 30,
SEASON IV
