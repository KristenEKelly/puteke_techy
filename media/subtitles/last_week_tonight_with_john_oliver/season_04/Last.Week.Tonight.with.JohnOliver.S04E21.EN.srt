00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,920
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,320
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to Last Week Tonight.

3
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,680
I am John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

4
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,680
Sadly, we must begin with the events
in Charlottesville, Virginia,

5
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,040
where one person was killed
and 19 injured after a car

6
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,480
plowed into protesters following
a rally of white nationalists.

7
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,040
It was truly a weekend of horrifying
images.

8
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:56,320
We saw Nazi flags and marchers carrying
torches, tiki torches, by the way.

9
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,040
Because nothing says
"white nationalist",

10
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,480
quite like faux-Polynesian kitsch.

11
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,080
And look, a protester being killed
in the wake of neo-Nazis

12
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,360
marching in the streets of
an American city is the kind of tragedy

13
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,000
that calls for true leadership
from whoever is in the Oval Office.

14
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,640
Unfortunately, the current occupant
is this guy,

15
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,800
and even after a few hours
to think about it,

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,760
the best he could do was squeeze
in this response before a bill signing.

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,120
We condemn in the strongest
possible terms this egregious display

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,440
of hatred, bigotry, and violence
on many sides... on many sides.

19
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,440
Wait, "on many sides ?"
This was a white nationalist rally.

20
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,560
You have to call that out by name.

21
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,960
There honestly aren't many instances
in modern American politics

22
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,600
where you can honestly think,

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,040
"that guy really should
have mentioned the Nazis",

24
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,680
but this is emphatically one of them.

25
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,760
It's like a reverse Godwin's law,

26
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,560
if you fail to mention Nazism,
you lose the argument.

27
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,640
And having made
a wild false equivalence

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,280
between "Nazis"
and "people who oppose Nazis",

29
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,160
Trump moved on to his favorite subject,
himself.

30
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,480
It's been going on for a long time
in our country.

31
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,480
Not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama,

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,160
it's been going on
for a long, long time.

33
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,800
It seems Trump's first response
to anything bad happening

34
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,000
is always to immediately absolve
himself of any personal responsibility.

35
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,800
He's the kind of guy who starts
eulogies at funerals saying,

36
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,080
"Great guy, I didn't kill him, but he's
a great guy and I didn't do it."

37
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,040
And you know who might take issue
with his statement

38
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,280
that the white nationalists had nothing
to do with Donald Trump ?

39
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,440
The white nationalists themselves.

40
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,200
Because here is David Duke,
during yesterday's rally.

41
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,720
We are determined
to take our country back.

42
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,160
We're going to  fulfill the promises
of Donald Trump.

43
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,480
That's what we believed in.
That's why we voted for Donald Trump.

44
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,200
He said he is going to take our country
back, and that's what we gotta do.

45
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,840
I've got to say, David Duke and the
Nazis really seem to like Donald Trump,

46
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,920
which is weird, because Nazis
are a lot like cats:

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,400
if they like you, it's probably
because you're feeding them.

48
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,360
Also...

49
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,520
Cats are like Nazis,
but that's a whole different subject.

50
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,800
And that kind of connection there
is something that anyone

51
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,200
in their right mind would want to
immediately and repeatedly disavow.

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,840
And it's not like Trump wasn't given
the opportunity.

53
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,120
Watch what happened
at the end of his speech.

54
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,640
Thank you, everybody.

55
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,600
Mr. President ! How do you respond
to white nationalists

56
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,960
who say they're participating
in Charlottesville

57
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,640
because they support you ?

58
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,760
They'd like me to sign the bill here,
instead of outside.

59
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,280
So I think we'll do that. Okay ?
Thank you.

60
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,720
You know, for a second there,
as he came back to the podium,

61
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,600
I almost thought, well, maybe
he's about to say the right thing.

62
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,920
But of course not.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,800
He had one last shot before the buzzer
on the racism clock hit zero

64
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,640
and he threw an air ball so far away
it landed in the Third Reich.

65
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,600
And for the record,

66
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,560
even after he signed the bill,
he got another chance.

67
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,960
Mr. President, do you want the support
of these white nationalist groups

68
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,040
who say they support you ?

69
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,040
Have you denounced them
strongly enough ?

70
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,560
A car plowed into a group of people,
would you call that terrorism ?

71
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,480
So here is the problem with that:

72
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,880
a nonanswer in a moment like this
is an answer.

73
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,640
If you had asked me
"have you ever been aroused"

74
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,560
"by the fairies in Zelda:
The Ocarina of Time ?"

75
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,600
and I responded by slowly
and silently walking away from you,

76
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,400
you would know exactly
what I was saying.

77
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,440
And look,
don't take that just from me,

78
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,160
white nationalists seemed pretty clear
about the message

79
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,720
that Trump had sent to them
with his response.

80
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,320
This is from an infamous
neo-Nazi website.

81
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,600
Quote, Trump comments were good.
He said he loves us all.

82
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,280
Also refused to answer a question about
white nationalists supporting him.

83
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,680
No condemnation at all.

84
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,360
When asked to condemn,
he just walked out of the room.

85
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,760
Really, really good.
God bless him.

86
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,880
To which God immediately released
a statement saying:

87
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,400
"I unequivocally condemn
the Nazis who invoked my name."

88
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,320
"Their beliefs and actions in no way
reflect the glory of my creation."

89
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,920
"I mean, what kind of fucking idiot"

90
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,960
"would not immediately
distance himself from them ?"

91
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,840
And look: maybe Trump will,
eventually, take a second swing

92
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,960
at personally condemning
the white nationalists.

93
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,320
Maybe he has since we taped this show.

94
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,120
But even if he does, it'll be too late.

95
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,240
Because his first response is
who he is.

96
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,480
And the truly infuriating thing is
how completely predictable this was.

97
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,680
Nobody, no one in their right mind,
ahead of Trump's response yesterday,

98
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,040
thought, "okay, well,
this is going to go well."

99
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,320
But that still somehow didn't negate
just how painful it was to watch.

100
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,720
Because it simply doesn't get easier
than disavowing Nazis.

101
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,760
It's as much of a presidential gimme
as pardoning a fucking turkey.

102
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,200
It is almost impossible to screw it up.
But that's exactly what happened.

103
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,000
So there is clearly no point waiting
for leadership from our president

104
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,720
at moments like this,
because it is just not coming.

105
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,040
Which means we will have to look
to one another.

106
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,200
Because incredibly,

107
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,680
in a country where previous presidents
have actually had to defeat Nazis,

108
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,800
we now have one who cannot even be
bothered to fucking condemn them.

109
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,080
And now, this.

110
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,160
And now, highlights from Robocup 2017.

111
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,640
And now, highlights from Robocup 2017

112
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,880
vastly improved by Univision Deportes
commentator Luis Omar Tapia.

113
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:22,320
Goaaaaaaaaaaal !

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Moving on.

115
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,520
Our main story tonight concerns
North Korea,

116
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,440
America's number one excuse
for putting off chores this week.

117
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,280
"I could do laundry, but if the world's
about to erupt into nuclear war,"

118
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,080
"what really is the point ?"

119
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,880
North Korea has clearly been
on everyone's minds this week,

120
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,080
and I think you know why.

121
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,200
President Trump and North Korea
escalate the war of words,

122
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,520
lobbing new threats
and sending new tweets.

123
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,320
North Korea now accusing the president
of the United States

124
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,760
of pushing the world to, quote,
the brink of nuclear war.

125
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,000
When Twitter was invented,
I'll bet even they didn't imagine

126
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,600
that it would one day lead us to
the brink of nuclear Armageddon.

127
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,920
It's like if the invention of the Furby
had led to the Sudanese Civil War.

128
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,600
Who knew that that's where
it was headed ?

129
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,320
Now tensions have sharply
escalated this week,

130
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,120
which is a little surprising,
given that the world has been dealing

131
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,840
with North Korea's provocative
missile tests for years now.

132
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,160
Just two weeks ago,
they were doing this.

133
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,240
North Korea fires yet another missile,

134
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,040
but Pyongyang claims this one
will be able to hit the U.S. mainland,

135
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,440
striking cities like Los Angeles,
Denver, Chicago,

136
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,080
and possibly even
New York and Boston.

137
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,560
Wait, New York ? I live in New York !
This shit just got real !

138
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,800
Now, I think if everyone
is really honest,

139
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,680
your level of fear over the North Korea
situation is in direct proportion

140
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,920
to whether or not they can hit
the exact place where you live.

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,400
We film this show on 57th Street.

142
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,720
If you told me that the blast radius
stops at 56th Street,

143
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,680
I'd think "well, I hope
nothing happens,"

144
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,960
"but we've still got some time
before things get serious."

145
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,280
Now, it is worth properly understanding

146
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,800
what North Korea
is currently capable of.

147
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,080
Because while their missiles
may be able to reach us,

148
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,360
and they do have
nuclear warheads,

149
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,360
most experts believe that they
don't yet have the technology

150
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,720
to reliably hit
the U.S. mainland.

151
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,200
So that is reassuring.

152
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,240
Although, on the other hand, a recent
Pentagon assessment did suggest

153
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,600
that they could cross
that threshold next year.

154
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,800
So if a job interviewer asks you,

155
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,200
"where do you see yourself
in five years' time ?"

156
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,600
it is now perfectly acceptable just
to scream in terror into their face.

157
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,640
Look, this is clearly a very serious
situation, requiring a deft hand.

158
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,400
And sadly, that's not what it got.

159
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,560
North Korea best not make any more
threats to the United States.

160
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:58,160
They will be met with fire and fury,
like the world has never seen.

161
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,880
"Fire and fury" ?

162
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,360
The only way that
that is not terrifying is

163
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,160
if you report it the way that one
newspaper actually did in Maine,

164
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,520
saying "Trump warns of fire and furry,"

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,640
in which case Trump was threatening
to send this to North Korea,

166
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,480
which is a very different
kind of threat.

167
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,240
Now, in response, North Korea
announced plans to fire missiles

168
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,320
that would land just off the coast
of the U.S. territory of Guam.

169
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,160
Which is frightening,
although not unprecedented.

170
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,240
They have made similar threats before.

171
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,800
But what is different this time,
obviously,

172
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,880
is that we now have a president who has
the general temperament of a wet cat.

173
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,320
And in response to that Guam threat,
Trump promptly doubled down.

174
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,480
Frankly the people that were
questioning that statement,

175
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,360
was it too tough,
maybe it wasn't tough enough.

176
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,600
If anything, that statement may not be
tough enough.

177
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,600
What would be tougher
than fire and fury ?

178
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,200
Well, you'll see, you'll see.

179
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,760
"Yeah, we're gonna go
with that bomb"

180
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,520
"more destructive than the nuclear
bomb. Why ? I don't know !"

181
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,200
"Who cares that it doesn't exist ?
Sincerely yours, Donald Trump."

182
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,200
"I'm not writing a letter, I'm talking.
Says you. Fake news. Goodbye !"

183
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,400
So tonight, we thought we would ask:

184
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,800
What, exactly,
is North Korea thinking ?

185
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,480
How did we get into this mess ?

186
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,360
And what can we possibly do about it ?

187
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,240
And let's start by trying to understand

188
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,360
just a little bit more
about North Korea.

189
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,240
And that in itself is difficult.

190
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,880
It's one of the most isolated nations
on Earth.

191
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,560
If you know anything about it at all,

192
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,120
it's probably just that they have
a wacky, totalitarian leader

193
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,200
who loves military parades
and Dennis Rodman,

194
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,280
and who really didn't like that Seth
Rogen movie about his assassination.

195
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,000
And it can be hard to trust
any information about North Korea,

196
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,200
because lots of it is inaccurate,
for multiple reasons.

197
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,600
First, there's the outright state
propaganda,

198
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,000
which glorifies North Korea's leaders,
the Kim family.

199
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,560
Just last year, we showed you
western journalists

200
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,120
being taken on a tour
of a historic target range,

201
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,720
where they learned something
suspiciously impressive

202
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,400
about Kim Jong-un's father.

203
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,600
Comrade Kim Jong-il shot three bullets
and three of them got bullseye.

204
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,760
They all got bulls-eye ?
And how old was he at the time ?

205
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,040
He was 7-year-old.

206
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,400
- A 7-year-old got three bulls-eyes ?
- Yeah.

207
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,200
That's pretty impressive.

208
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,120
I mean, that is the mm-hmm of someone

209
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,960
who really wants to shut down
a conversation.

210
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,440
She sounds like a parent fielding
questions about where babies come from.

211
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,880
"So, a stork brings the baby ?"
"Mm-hmm."

212
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,960
"It carries an 8-pound baby through
the air in its mouth ?" "Mm-hmm."

213
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,960
"Isn't that dangerous ?"
"Mm-hmm."

214
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,560
"Where does the stork get the babies ?"
"Storks fuck ! They fuck each other !"

215
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,840
"Storks fuck each other and the baby
comes out of the stork's vagina !"

216
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,880
"Don't ask for the truth
if you can't handle it !"

217
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,640
But, here's the thing: inaccuracies
like that are easy to spot.

218
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,800
What is trickier is that
a lot of eye-catching Western

219
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,160
reporting about North Korea
can be shakily sourced, like this one.

220
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,600
The BBC reports all of the men
in the Hermit Kingdom

221
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,440
must now sport the same haircut
as the dear leader, Kim Jong-un.

222
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,560
His look was known

223
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,880
as the Chinese smuggler haircut
not too long ago in the region,

224
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,080
but now it will be known as the haircut
every man in North Korea must have.

225
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,160
Lucky them.

226
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,840
Here's the thing: there is no solid
evidence that that story is true.

227
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,840
But it is seductive,
because it sounds like it could be.

228
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,560
It's like if you saw the headline:
"Trump to NATO: I invented squirrels."

229
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,320
You'd believe it, because it sounds
like something he would have claimed,

230
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,920
even though, as of this taping,
he has not.

231
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,200
And while it may not be true

232
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,760
that all men had to get the same
haircut as Kim Jong-un,

233
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,880
state TV did run a series called

234
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,640
"let us trim our hair in accordance
with the socialist lifestyle".

235
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,840
And it's weird when a verifiable truth
is almost as strange as a wild rumor.

236
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,480
It's like how the "Richard Gere
put a gerbil in his ass" story

237
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,040
is completely false,
but what if the truth was

238
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,520
that he engaged in consensual mutual
anal play with a chinchilla ?

239
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,840
That would still be bizarre.
You wouldn't have to exaggerate that.

240
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,200
And sometimes, the truth about life
in North Korea

241
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,680
can be just as striking
as the urban legends.

242
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,880
For instance, you may've seen claims
online

243
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,320
that "every teacher in North Korea
is obligated to play the accordion."

244
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,920
We could not confirm that,
although in trying to, we did discover

245
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,440
that North Korea does love
the accordion to a surprising extent.

246
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,120
The country is full of them.

247
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,920
Here is an accordion factory.

248
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,320
Here's some schoolchildren playing
the accordion.

249
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,960
Here's Kim Jong-un looking
at an accordion.

250
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,800
Here is an air combat exercise,

251
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,560
where the camera pans across pilots
and guess what ?

252
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,920
Yep.
It's a fucking accordion.

253
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,440
They also have a very popular song
called "Nothing To Envy In The World"

254
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,640
that begins with the line

255
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,320
"the sky is blue, my heart is merry,
let the sound of accordions ring."

256
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,960
And then there is this video
of North Koreans

257
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,720
playing the last song
that you would expect.

258
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:11,600
Yes, that is North Korean accordionists
playing "Take on Me".

259
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,240
So, beat that, everyone else
who plays the accordion !

260
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,040
By which I mean, exactly two old French
men, and one Weird Al Yankovic.

261
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,880
And if you think that
that is the most amazing piece

262
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,160
of North Korean pop culture that you're
going to see tonight, you are wrong.

263
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,920
Because let me introduce you
to "Pulgasari",

264
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,360
a 1985 movie known
as the "North Korean Godzilla".

265
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,440
The whole thing is incredible, but this
is undoubtedly my favorite part.

266
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,000
You know why I love that ?
It's relatable.

267
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,920
No matter where you're from,

268
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,840
or what your religious
or political beliefs are,

269
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,920
at some point, everybody
has been about to decapitate someone

270
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,720
and then out of nowhere
a baby monster jumps up

271
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,360
and takes a bite out
of your sword.

272
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,560
It works because it resonates.

273
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,960
And look: we're all having fun,
we're laughing about North Korea !

274
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,000
And it can be very funny.

275
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,680
But the very fact that that is true

276
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,240
can be extremely frustrating
to journalists who cover it.

277
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,240
It's always an exaggeration, and
a parody, and kind of a freak show.

278
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,200
Which I think those of us who cover
North Korea find a bit distressing

279
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:35,160
because it's not actually very funny to
the 24 million people who live there.

280
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,360
She's right.
She's absolutely right.

281
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,080
And even when North Korea
is objectively funny,

282
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,080
like with "Pulgasari,"
it has dark undertones.

283
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,400
Because Kim Jong-il got that movie made

284
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,560
by abducting two of South Korea's
biggest names in film,

285
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,080
and forcing them
to make movies for him for years.

286
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,320
And you know what ?
They did eventually escape.

287
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,840
So I'm going to go ahead and say

288
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,120
and I know this is not going
to be a popular opinion,

289
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,880
but if that's what it took to give us
that baby monster scene,

290
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,480
it was fucking worth it.

291
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,800
Just my opinion, just my opinion.

292
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,960
But the underlying truth
of North Korea is

293
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,080
that it is a dark place,
not just figuratively, but literally.

294
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,880
You can get a sense of how
little development has been there

295
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,560
when you look at it from space.

296
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,000
See that void where there is almost
no lights ?

297
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,320
That's North Korea.

298
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,800
It looks like a divorced dad's
Christmas tree,

299
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,840
where he gave up halfway
through hanging the lights,

300
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,440
got drunk and fell asleep
watching "Ken Burns: Baseball."

301
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,360
And the Kim family is known

302
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,960
for their bone-chilling cruelty
and mismanagement.

303
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,080
They were largely responsible
for the deaths

304
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,640
of somewhere between six hundred
thousand and 2.5 million people

305
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,720
during a famine in the 1990s.

306
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,720
And we know that there are large,
brutal camps

307
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,560
where political dissidents
are imprisoned,

308
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,280
sometimes alongside
their extended families.

309
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,000
Satellite images show their scale,

310
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,840
but for a picture
of what they're really like,

311
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,480
we can only rely
on those who've been there.

312
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,200
Every night someone tries to escape.

313
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,360
Or someone doesn't obey their orders.

314
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,640
For that they strip you naked.

315
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,480
And start the beating...

316
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,600
They beat you all night long.

317
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,600
These sketches are the recollections

318
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,320
of other prisoners who've managed
to escape the camps.

319
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,680
That is truly horrific.

320
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,880
But the existence, the continued
existence of those camps

321
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,160
brings us to a really important point
to understand:

322
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,480
Kim Jong-un is terrified
of losing power.

323
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,720
And while we love to present him
as a madman, many experts believe

324
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,000
that his actions are motivated
by rational self-preservation.

325
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,240
He has seen leaders like Saddam
Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi

326
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,520
scale back their nuclear programs,
only to be overthrown,

327
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,080
either by the U.S.
or by their own people,

328
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,880
and die gruesome deaths.
And it's true that dictators

329
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,960
generally don't end their careers
like disgraced American politicians,

330
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,920
with a stint
on Dancing With The Stars,

331
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,360
although that would've been
an incredible season.

332
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,400
Saddam, that foxtrot was a weapon
of mass seduction.

333
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,120
And Muammar, you worked hard
and it showed.

334
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,200
So, Kim Jong-un has continued
his family's military first policy,

335
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,800
spending huge amounts of money

336
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,480
on what is the fourth largest military
on Earth

337
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,320
and an expensive nuclear program,

338
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,200
in an impoverished country
whose economy has been estimated

339
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,360
to be smaller than that
of Birmingham, Alabama.

340
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,880
And Birmingham is a small economy.

341
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,400
Their most notable export is American
Idol season five winner Taylor Hicks.

342
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,560
Not that I am saying
that's a bad thing.

343
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,960
Soul Patrol forever !

344
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,560
Soul Patrol till I fucking die.

345
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,600
So, how can Kim Jong-un justify
that spending ?

346
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,640
Well, he argues that the huge military
is the only thing

347
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,320
staving off imminent invasion
from a host of outsiders.

348
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,960
And that is where we come in.

349
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,360
Because the most dominant
and useful villain

350
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,760
in North Korea's narrative
is the United States.

351
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,080
And it is not like that comes out
of nowhere.

352
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,320
We sided with the South
during the Korean War.

353
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,200
And while many Americans
may have forgotten

354
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,120
just how devastating that war was,
the North Koreans certainly haven't.

355
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,320
They have an entire museum devoted
to American war atrocities.

356
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,480
And I am not saying
that there were none,

357
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,280
but I don't think any were quite
as over-the-top as this.

358
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,400
In the last liberation war,
during our strategic retreat,

359
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,960
the American hyenas
occupied the land of Shinchon.

360
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,200
They arrested Min Young Shik
and stabbed her muscles

361
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,400
with a three-pronged spear
and sucked her flowing blood.

362
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,480
They also took the flesh
from her thighs using a bayonet,

363
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,480
dipped it in salt, and ate it.

364
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,640
And in case you're wondering:

365
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,640
yes, you can buy coasters depicting
that scene in the gift shop.

366
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,200
But they are 16 dollars,
which is the real war crime there !

367
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,480
And the North Koreans' indoctrination
in anti-Americanism

368
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,720
starts extremely young,
as one defector remembers.

369
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,880
In math book says, you know,
there are four American bastards.

370
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,280
You kill two of them.

371
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,360
Then how many American bastards
are there left to kill ?

372
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,760
And as a child I had to say,
two American bastards.

373
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,840
And that was my education.

374
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,320
Holy shit ! It is fascinating
when a country's culture seeps

375
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,200
even into their math lessons,
although it's not really surprising.

376
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,280
As a British child,
our math questions were,

377
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,920
if Johnny has two artifacts,
and Dinesh has two artifacts,

378
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,880
then how many artifacts
is Johnny about to have ?

379
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,520
The answer, of course:
all the artifacts.

380
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,000
Dinesh's family can come visit them
in the British Museum

381
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,560
whenever they're in town.

382
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,920
And the notion that North Korea
is working on a bomb

383
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,400
that can kill
all the American bastards

384
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,600
is a tremendous
source of national pride.

385
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,200
There have been stamps depicting

386
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,640
missiles hurtling towards
the U.S. Capitol,

387
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,640
and a few years ago,
they produced a video

388
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,560
depicting the destruction
of New York,

389
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,320
set to the least
appropriate song imaginable.

390
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,360
Yes, you heard right, that was
a karaoke version of We Are The World,

391
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,680
set to New York in flames.

392
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,800
And the last time I saw a karaoke song

393
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,440
with background imagery
that inappropriate was

394
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,400
every time
I have ever sung karaoke.

395
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,800
I don't know what LL Cool J's
"Doin' It"

396
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,240
has to do with these two babies
in a field of sunflowers,

397
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,640
but it's making
everybody uncomfortable.

398
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,920
So the North Korean regime
has been very careful

399
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,480
about presenting a threatening image
of Americans to its people.

400
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,880
And some activists have actually
been trying to undermine that

401
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,040
by sneaking information
into the country on USB drives.

402
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,400
We send various content
from stories on human rights,

403
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,400
general information on South Korea, to
images depicting the average American.

404
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,160
Or a fictional version
of the average American:

405
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,480
TV shows like The Mentalist
and Desperate Housewives.

406
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,160
Kang says scenes like this one
from NCIS...

407
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,480
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

408
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,400
...that show police officers reading
suspects their rights are very useful.

409
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,480
You know what, if nothing else,
we finally have our answer

410
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,080
to the decade-long question:
who the fuck is watching NCIS ?

411
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,880
It turns out it's all your mom's
friends, and the people of North Korea.

412
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,880
And if you think about it, that is very
dangerous for Kim Jong-un.

413
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,920
Because if people get a sense
that the image of America

414
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,720
that he has carefully painted for them
is false, he could have huge problems.

415
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,800
And when you understand him
in that light,

416
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,080
as a dictator desperately
hedging against a loss of power,

417
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,640
it is possible to understand

418
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,400
why all his recent threats against
the United States have been reckless,

419
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,680
but, in his mind, also rational.

420
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,120
And that brings us
to the key question here:

421
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,240
what are we going to do
about this ?

422
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,840
Because on the campaign trail, Donald
Trump made it all seem very simple.

423
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,040
They said, would you speak
to the leader of North Korea ?

424
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,960
I said, absolutely.
Why not ? Why not ?

425
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,720
And they come out:
Trump would speak to him !

426
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,440
Who the hell cares ?
I'll speak to anybody.

427
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,960
Who knows ? There's a ten percent
or a twenty percent chance

428
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,440
that I can talk him out
of those damn nukes,

429
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,840
'cause who the hell wants him
to have nukes ?

430
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,240
And there's a chance !

431
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,960
No, no, there really isn't.
Partly because remember:

432
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,680
Kim Jong-un believes they are critical
for his survival,

433
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,480
and on top of that,
Donald Trump is a shitty negotiator.

434
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,800
In his short presidency,

435
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,360
he has failed to get Mexico
to pay for his stupid wall,

436
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,480
he's failed to get a Congress his party
controls to pass a health care bill,

437
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,120
and even when his administration
does get something done,

438
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,280
it way oversells it,
like when the White House announced

439
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,680
a trade deal with China as very big
news, gigantic and Herculean,

440
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,040
and one much-celebrated component
turned out to be

441
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,960
lifting a ban on beef imports

442
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,480
that China had preliminarily
agreed to last September.

443
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,960
So way to fucking go there, Donald !
What a very big, Herculean deal !

444
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,360
Thanks to you,
except not entirely thanks to you,

445
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,360
America is now marginally more able
to export beef again !

446
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,000
And since taking office,

447
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,920
Trump has voiced support
for an even simpler solution.

448
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:22,240
China is helping us possibly
or probably

449
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,680
with the North Korean
situation.

450
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,200
Okay ? Which is a great thing.
Great thing.

451
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,160
So, in the space
of fourteen seconds there,

452
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,120
he said the word great twice,

453
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,880
he pronounced Chinaaaa with three
syllables,

454
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,160
suggested someone else
should do the work for him,

455
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,160
and then threw in
a possibly or probably,

456
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,760
rendering the whole thing
meaningless.

457
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,000
I think I may have just hit
Trump bingo,

458
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,720
and the prize that I want
is to go drown in a river.

459
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,560
But Trump's idea there

460
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:57,360
of convincing China to exert influence
on North Korea is not inherently crazy,

461
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,120
China shares an 800-mile border
with North Korea,

462
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,360
and accounts for as much as 90 percent
of North Korea's total trade,

463
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,200
so they do have significant
leverage.

464
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,160
But, some are skeptical about just
what China could, or is willing to do.

465
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,440
Take sanctions.

466
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,080
The UN have tried multiple rounds
of increasingly harsh sanctions,

467
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,160
but North Korea has always found
easy ways around them.

468
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,480
North Korea is a 100% state enterprise,

469
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,880
so these companies change
their names the next day

470
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,640
if they're listed for sanctions.

471
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,440
That way the company stays,

472
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,120
but with different names
whenever there are sanctions.

473
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,320
If I'm included in the list,
my name can be changed too.

474
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,920
Yeah, and that is some pretty weak
enforcement.

475
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Think about it this way:

476
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,760
Let's say HBO decided
they wanted to cancel this show.

477
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,640
Their hand would be pretty weak
if I was just able to get around that

478
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,640
simply by changing the name
to Earlier Times But Now,

479
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,560
starring
Spance Mörgendörffer.

480
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,920
And it is true that China could
increase enforcement of its sanctions,

481
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,440
but they are understandably worried
about where that could lead.

482
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,720
What they worry about is, if they
do that, will the regime collapse ?

483
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,680
What does that mean ? Millions
of refugees pouring into China,

484
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,360
possibly unified Korea

485
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,720
that is then a pro-American country
sitting on their southern border,

486
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,960
which, don't forget, there are 30,000
American troops in South Korea,

487
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,720
which would then be on China's border,
and, by the way, 15 nuclear weapons.

488
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,520
You know that there are a lot of
problems when you end up saying,

489
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,560
oh and by the way: 15 nuclear weapons.

490
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,760
Imagine you were a babysitter
and you heard

491
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,360
okay, you've got his Epipen,
you know about his nut allergy,

492
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:35,160
he needs his inhaler every hour oh, and
by the way: he has 15 nuclear weapons.

493
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,520
Now, Trump has also been mentioning
military solutions.

494
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,360
But even targeted strikes
against weapons systems

495
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,280
could get out of hand very fast.
North Korea would likely retaliate

496
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,720
and they have an estimated
8,000 pieces of heavy artillery

497
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,840
stationed just north of the DMZ,
which is here.

498
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,440
And that artillery is capable
of reaching Seoul,

499
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,840
which is just 40 miles away,
and is an area with 25 million people.

500
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,960
So even a non-nuclear war
could have horrific results.

501
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,520
And let's just engage
in some truly magical thinking:

502
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,720
what if you could somehow just take out
Kim Jong-un ?

503
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,800
Well, you've probably got an immediate
humanitarian crisis on your hands,

504
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,440
as well as a leaderless country with
a power vacuum and nuclear weapons.

505
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,840
And as we've learned from Iraq
and Afghanistan,

506
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,320
when regimes fall
and there is no plan in place,

507
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,040
that vacuum
can be filled with terrible things.

508
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,440
We do not  want to find out
what North Korea's ISIS would be.

509
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:33,520
Even just the phrase North Korea's ISIS
is absolutely terrifying.

510
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,080
It's like saying 9/11's Bill Cosby.

511
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,480
What would that even be ?
I hope we never have to find out.

512
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,240
So sanctions are no guarantee, and
military action could be catastrophic.

513
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,240
And diplomacy is going to be difficult,

514
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,760
given that you usually need
to have a specific goal in mind,

515
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,240
and Trump seems to be making
all of this up as he goes along.

516
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,920
We are learning stunning new details

517
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,680
about President Trump's extraordinary
fire and fury threat tonight,

518
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,200
multiple sources telling CNN
the president adlibbed those words,

519
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,040
they were improvised on the fly.

520
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,400
Oh, for fuck's sake.
That is just not a good idea.

521
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,240
As I'm sure someone
has had to say

522
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,800
to Wayne Brady
at a funeral more than once:

523
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,080
now is not a good time
to improvise.

524
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,480
Here's a one-word suggestion, Wayne:
mourn. Mourn like a person.

525
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,880
And look, the thing is that's not
a surprise !

526
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,560
Deep down, we all assumed
that he was winging it.

527
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,760
We have become accustomed

528
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,120
to discounting a large percentage
of what comes out of his face.

529
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,880
But North Korea is listening
to what he says.

530
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,680
And the people there have been primed
for decades

531
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,280
to believe that America
is on the brink of an invasion.

532
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,080
Just look at their government's
response to his fire and fury line.

533
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,440
The American commander in chief
remains stuck at a golf course,

534
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,840
oblivious to what is happening,

535
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,680
and talking about such nonsense
as 'fire and fury'.

536
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,960
Since it is impossible

537
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,400
to have talks with people who are
incapable of rational thought,

538
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,120
the strategic armed forces has judged

539
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,440
that we must respond
with absolute force.

540
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,880
Hey, hey, hey, okay, just to be clear:

541
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,800
the president is not stuck
at a golf course.

542
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,080
Unless the cart ran out of gas
and he has to walk.

543
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,520
In which case, yes, the president
is very much stuck at a golf course,

544
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,760
and may need to be airlifted out.

545
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,400
So here is where we are,
we have two nuclear-armed leaders,

546
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,400
who are accustomed to issuing empty
threats to impress their own people,

547
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,560
and they are now currently goading each
other towards Armageddon.

548
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,400
Which is absolutely terrifying.

549
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,480
And I don't really have a solution
to this.

550
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,880
But part of me would love the chance

551
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,360
to speak directly
to the North Korean people.

552
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,360
So on the off chance that this show
is smuggled over their border

553
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,680
on a USB drive
crammed with NCIS episodes,

554
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,120
I would just like to say this:
Hi, North Korea.

555
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,040
You may be hearing some frightening
rhetoric from our president.

556
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,760
But, if it helps at all,
when our president says words,

557
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,360
he doesn't necessarily mean
what those words mean.

558
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,600
It's very difficult to describe to you.

559
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,280
We're still trying to wrap our heads
around it ourselves.

560
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,080
Really, it's our problem, except it is
now kind of your problem, too.

561
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,520
But I want to talk to you
about some misconceptions.

562
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,520
Because we certainly have
misconceptions about you,

563
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,960
but you should know, ideally,

564
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,600
that we are not remotely what
your state propaganda implies either.

565
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,640
We honestly do not spend our days
plotting your destruction.

566
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,000
We spend them sharing cat memes,
and spinning fidgii,

567
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,800
and getting furiously angry
about a singing boy

568
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,480
barely appearing
in our favorite dragon show.

569
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,000
So, for what it's worth,

570
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,240
I would like to give you,
the North Korean people,

571
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,160
a sense of how America
is feeling right now,

572
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,200
in a way that you might understand
and enjoy.

573
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,520
And that is through the international
language of the accordion.

574
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,200
And I have some good news
and some bad news there.

575
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,400
The bad news is,
I do not play the accordion.

576
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,640
The good news is, I know someone
who plays it like a fucking angel.

577
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,720
Ladies and gentlemen,
and the people of North Korea,

578
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,960
please welcome Mr. Weird Al Yankovic.

579
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,720
Would you annihilate us
if you had the chance ?

580
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,160
That's such an anti-social thing to do.

581
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,040
You've got us crapping
our collective pants

582
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,360
May I suggest you take it down
a notch or two ?

583
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,800
We're not exactly sure
why you're upset.

584
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,800
Did that Seth Rogen movie make you
super mad ?

585
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,480
You'd like us if you got to know us,
I bet.

586
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,840
We're mostly harmless, decent people,
hey, we're really not so bad.

587
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,520
My point is...
Please don't nuke us, North Korea !

588
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,080
Right now we're all a little tense.

589
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,440
Believe me, we don't hate you !

590
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,400
Frankly, we don't even think
that much about you.

591
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,600
No offense !

592
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:57,920
Now you might call us bloodthirsty
dogs, but that metaphor's not very apt.

593
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,560
We're just a bunch of simple
fidget spinnin', goofy dorks

594
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,320
who probably
couldn't find your country on a map.

595
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,640
No, we're not savages or cannibals.

596
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,720
Well, maybe just a really,
really, really small percent.

597
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,200
So I think it would be best if you'd
knock off those missile tests.

598
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,520
Don't turn us into cinder
while we're swipin' right on Tinder.

599
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,880
Don't jump-start Armageddon
or our beds we'll soon be wettin'.

600
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,680
Won't you think this through
for a moment ?

601
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,920
Please, now why would you bomb
our nice celebrities ?

602
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,400
Oh, why in the world would you kill
Tom Hanks ?

603
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,600
'Cause nobody doesn't like Tom Hanks !

604
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,640
So, please don't nuke us, North Korea !

605
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,080
That would seriously ruin our day.

606
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,760
Remember, we're not evil psychotic
monsters,

607
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,520
no matter what the news
may say.

608
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:58,560
We're just those goofballs
from the USA.

609
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,680
Weird Al Yankovic,
ladies and gentlemen.

610
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,720
That's our show.
Thank you for watching.

611
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,960
We'll see you next week, good night !
