LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,560
Season IV
Episode 23

3
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,320
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,160
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,200
As we speak, Hurricane Irma
is battering Florida,

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,680
I cannot recommend strongly enough
that you watch something else now.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,040
Because for us,
we have a lot to catch up on.

8
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,040
We have been off
and we've missed a lot of stories,

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,400
from tensions with North Korea,
to Equifax's massive data breach,

10
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,280
to me falling off
the Taylor Swift train...

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,560
Look what you made me do,
Taylor.

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,440
But we have to begin
tonight with President Trump.

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,440
The Eric Trump of old people.

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,520
The president had an erratic week,
characterized by two big decisions.

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,800
He met with congressional leaders
to hammer out a deal

16
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,640
to raise the debt ceiling
and fund the government.

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,520
Democrats wanted a three-month
extension, to give them leverage,

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,520
Republican leadership was fiercely
against that.

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,000
Republicans wanted a long-term solution
to avoid another fight in December.

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,240
But, sitting
down with leaders of both parties,

21
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,800
the president sided
with the Democrats.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,680
That stunning image, the president
cutting a deal with Democrats

23
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,680
and blindsiding his own party.

24
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,560
That is a surprising move,
from Chuck Schumer's expression.

25
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,840
It is as if he's right
in the middle of saying:

26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,600
"yooouuu... are not
very smart, are ya, buddy ?"

27
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,280
The details of the negotiation
are really striking,

28
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,000
three months was
the Democrats' first offer.

29
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,240
Trump just took it. Republicans
apparently froze in mid-smile.

30
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,920
Which must've been
an unsettling sight,

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,320
this is what it looks like when
Mitch McConnell smiles in real time.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,480
It's creepy when his smile moves.
It's terrifying when it freezes.

33
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,840
Before Republicans could even try and
salvage the meeting, it was derailed.

34
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,240
At the height of a tense meeting,
sources say, first daughter Ivanka,

35
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,120
entered the Oval Office to pitch
her agenda on the child tax credit,

36
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,160
throwing the meeting off-topic.

37
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,360
Republican leaders
annoyed by her presence.

38
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,840
That's the name of Ivanka's
upcoming biography:

39
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,320
"Visibly Annoyed by Her Presence:
The Ivanka Trump Story."

40
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,240
That was far from the most
uncomfortable moment involving Ivanka

41
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,880
because at a North Dakota
event that same day,

42
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,040
he introduced
his daughter like this.

43
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,400
Come up, honey.
Should I bring Ivanka up ?

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,880
Come on up, honey. She's so good.
She wanted to make the trip.

45
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,440
She actually said:
"Daddy, can I go with you ?"

46
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,440
I like that. Right ?
I said: yes, you can.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,400
His 35-year-old daughter calls
him "Daddy" and he likes it.

48
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,480
That is just one of those facts
that on some level,

49
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,480
I never
wanted to have confirmed.

50
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,400
When someone AirBnB's your place,
they ejaculate on literally everything,

51
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,840
or "if I was there for Manson murders,
I would have stabbed someone."

52
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,760
I'm not good with peer pressure !

53
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,160
It would have been so weird
if I was the only one not stabbing !

54
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,240
I'd have probably
had a quick stab.

55
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,920
It is good that the government
is getting funded.

56
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,600
But nobody seems exactly sure
why Trump made this decision.

57
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,440
One senior Republican aide
told Politico it was "mystifying",

58
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,920
adding, "maybe it's about the wall ?
None of it makes any sense."

59
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,360
Which should have been the slogan
of Trump's presidential campaign.

60
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,880
Maybe it's about the wall ?
None of it makes any sense.

61
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,600
This was not the only big decision
Trump made for less-than-clear reasons.

62
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,760
On Tuesday, he took
a far more consequential step.

63
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,720
Trump ends former President Obama's
signature immigration program.

64
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,600
The Deferred Action for Childhood
Arrivals known as DACA

65
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,880
protects 800 000
undocumented immigrants

66
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,760
who came to the US as kids
from deportation.

67
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,560
Donald Trump ended DACA,
which allowed him to both kill

68
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,120
an Obama-era program and pick
100 of thousands of immigrants.

69
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,600
Which, for Trump, is really
killing two birds with one stone,

70
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,400
incidentally, his favorite
childhood pastime.

71
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,760
"Mommy, I killed the fancy
pigeons again ! I need a new batch."

72
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,240
DACA not only protects its recipients,
or "Dreamers", from deportation,

73
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,720
it allows them to work through
renewable two-year permits.

74
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,800
A measure implemented by Obama,

75
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,560
because Congress failed to pass
immigration reform for a decade.

76
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,120
Whatever people's feelings on other
aspects of immigration,

77
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,920
they believe that Dreamers should
be allowed to stay in the country.

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,800
During the campaign,
Trump promised his base

79
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,880
not only that he would end DACA,
but he would deport its recipients.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,680
He didn't seem to have much
in the way of a concrete plan.

81
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,040
- They have to go.
- What if they have no place to go ?

82
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,560
We will work with them. We either have
a country or we don't have a country.

83
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,080
We will do it and we will expedite it
so people can come back in.

84
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,760
- It's still not clear.
- It will work out so well.

85
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,400
In four years
you're going to say:

86
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,400
what a great job you've done,
President Trump.

87
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,400
But that is not a plan.
Saying "they have to go",

88
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,600
but then they can
maybe come back in,

89
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,200
and ending sounding like
he's trying to hypnotize Chuck Todd.

90
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,760
It will work out so well.
You'll be so happy.

91
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,600
In four years you're going to say:
what a great job, President Trump.

92
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,400
I snap my fingers, you wake up
and wet your pants.

93
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,240
You would hope
that now he's in office,

94
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,280
Trump would've formulated a plan
outlining what he would like to see.

95
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,760
As late as one hour before the decision
was to be announced,

96
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,080
administration officials
privately expressed concern

97
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,760
that Mr. Trump might not know
the steps he was about to take.

98
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,760
Which is awful, but it is something
we all probably presumed.

99
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,400
Like Tom Hanks's character
in "Cast Away" fucked Wilson.

100
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,800
There is no doubt
that that happened.

101
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,240
Later that day, Trump seemed
to be walking back his decision,

102
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,360
saying Congress had six months
to legalize DACA, and if they didn't

103
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,280
he would "revisit this issue".

104
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,040
Dreamers have to go. But maybe
they can come back.

105
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,240
Or maybe
they don't have to go at all.

106
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,640
800 000 people's lives
are in the balance.

107
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,240
And when asked on Air Force One
about these mixed signals,

108
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,840
he was maddeningly vague about
anything even resembling a plan.

109
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,360
Chuck and Nancy would like
to see something happen, so do I.

110
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,920
If we can get something to
happen, we're going to sign it,

111
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,440
and we're gonna make
a lot of happy people.

112
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:13,120
Okay. Anytime Trump says he's
going to make people happy

113
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,720
or that you're going
to be happy in the future,

114
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,560
that means he has got nothing,
he's trying to end the conversation.

115
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,440
That's how he shut down
Chuck Todd on the plane.

116
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,760
And he does it
with everything.

117
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,880
Here's how he talk to businesses
about his plans to change trade policy.

118
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,320
Wait 'til you see what's up for you.
You are going to be so happy.

119
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,280
That is the tone of somebody who
forgot to buy an anniversary gift

120
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,960
and is stalling for time.

121
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,840
Wait until you see
what's up for you.

122
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,160
I'm going to be back in 45 minutes.
You're gonna be so happy.

123
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,000
He does this for everything. Here
are his promises for border safety,

124
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,280
the Middle East, steel tariffs,
replacing Obamacare and infrastructure.

125
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,880
We are going to make it
so that everybody is happy.

126
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,040
The steel folks
are going to be very happy.

127
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,240
Millions of people will be happy.

128
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,280
You have millions of people
that are unhappy.

129
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,400
You'll be so happy with Trump.
I think you already are.

130
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,040
In each case, it's the way you get
to that feeling that is important.

131
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,480
Laying out a policy
that's just "you'll be so happy"

132
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,600
is like naming a restaurant
"you're gonna be so full".

133
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,080
Okay, that's the goal, but how ?
What am I filling myself with ?

134
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,840
Is it Asian fusion or wet cement ?
I promise this happens all the time.

135
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,680
In case you're wondering what he does
when people aren't happy,

136
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,000
he even has a solution for that.

137
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,600
Remember that debt ceiling meeting and
how furious McConnell and Ryan were ?

138
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,520
This was Trump that same day.

139
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,120
We walked out of there,
Mitch and Paul and Kevin,

140
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,240
and we walked out
and everybody was happy.

141
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,160
They weren't ! Not Mitch, not Paul,
not Kevin ! None of them !

142
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,680
Trump may be able to fool people
saying they'll be happy in the future

143
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,120
but we cannot let him trick people
they were happy in the past.

144
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:19,200
It is weirdly ironic he is taking
such a hard line against "Dreamers"

145
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,880
because this guy is clearly
out of his fucking mind.

146
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,040
And now, this.

147
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,560
A look at what the NFL will
and will not tolerate.

148
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,800
Colin Kaepernick is a free agent,
talented, but no team has signed him.

149
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,680
Many believe that's because he's
controversial for NFL fan bases.

150
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,920
A lot of baggage comes
with Kaepernick.

151
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,960
They don't wanna deal
with that in their stadiums.

152
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,120
Meanwhile...

153
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,640
Jones was suspended for one game
following an arrest for an incident

154
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,760
involving him spitting at a nurse.

155
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,480
Violated the NFL policy on
performance-enhancing substances.

156
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,640
- A DUI earlier in the off-season.
- Domestic violence.

157
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,480
- DWI in May.
- Arrested for extreme DUI.

158
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,280
He violated the league
substance abuse policy.

159
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,360
Bryant was also suspended
for the first four games last season

160
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,720
while he was a member of
the Cleveland Browns for P.E.D. use.

161
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,760
He was suspended for 3 games after
the Lions claimed him off waivers.

162
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,880
That suspension was due
to an arrest back in 2015.

163
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,440
And yet...

164
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,200
They would have a tough time
signing somebody

165
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,000
who protested the American flag
and the national anthem.

166
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,440
Moving on. Our main story
concerns presidential pardons.

167
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,240
The only genuine
get-out-of-jail free card.

168
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,840
Pardons are one
of the most powerful tools,

169
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,840
and they have been used
controversially in the past.

170
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,040
Bill Clinton pardoned Marc Rich.
Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon.

171
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,760
Abraham Lincoln once pardoned
a man for attempted bestiality.

172
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,320
That is true ! And in fairness:
this was the horse !

173
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,080
That's a pretty fuckable horse.
I am not saying you should fuck it.

174
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,120
I wouldn't kick it out of bed
for eating apples.

175
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:17,840
Donald Trump issued his very
first pardon, and it was a doozy.

176
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,680
A legal lightning bolt
from President Trump late Friday.

177
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,640
A pardon for Arizona's controversial
anti-illegal immigration hard-liner,

178
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,400
Sheriff Joe Arpaio.

179
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,880
Donald Trump pardoned Arpaio,
a man who answers the question:

180
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,280
"what if a decaying russet potato
somehow hated Mexicans ?"

181
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,280
Let's look at that decision.
If the President of the US

182
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,320
is going to use his first pardon
on someone, this early in his term,

183
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:52,000
it is worth knowing who Arpaio is,
and what the implications may be.

184
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,120
You probably may have heard
of Joe Arpaio before.

185
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,640
He has cultivated an image over
25 years as a hard-nosed sheriff

186
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,040
with unconventional methods,
that the media has lapped up.

187
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,840
Joe Arpaio is known
as America's toughest sheriff.

188
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,360
Arpaio, who has been dubbed
America's toughest sheriff.

189
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,080
America's toughest sheriff,
Joe Arpaio.

190
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,880
He's known for his crackdowns on
illegal immigration and petty crime.

191
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,800
He brags about making prisoners
eat bologna sandwiches rotten.

192
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,480
Makes his inmates wear pink,
uses chain gangs.

193
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,920
Inmates are forced to wear
striped prison garb and pink underwear.

194
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,960
That is just awful.
The pink underwear is fine,

195
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,080
but no one should be forced
to wear horizontal stripes.

196
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,880
They widen the silhouette !
That's a fashion fact.

197
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,880
Arpaio didn't mind that coverage,
he actually welcomed it !

198
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,600
He loves being on camera
so much that he spent years

199
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,880
treating prisoners as props for
a reality show, sometimes literally.

200
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,440
He actually had a short-lived show
called "Smile... You're Under Arrest",

201
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,960
where people with warrants
would be tricked

202
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,200
into appearing on a set,
only to be pranked.

203
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,600
I got one more surprise.

204
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,640
These two people are deputies
of Sheriff Joe Arpaio's office.

205
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,040
Take 'em down.

206
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,000
So dude, you gotta smile,
'cause you're under arrest !

207
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,240
For real !

208
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,320
There it is !

209
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,680
Wait. "There it is."
Now for the record,

210
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,600
even then, that reference
was 15 years old.

211
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,640
Which is a real wiggity-wack
thing to do, dawg.

212
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,320
Tricking people into arrest
for your own amusement

213
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,720
is a terrible idea
for a reality show.

214
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,720
The only worse idea is
"not making Peter the bachelor".

215
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,160
Look at that face.
Are you idiots, ABC ?

216
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,160
Peter, if you are out there,
you are, and shall ever remain

217
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,440
"my" bachelor.

218
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,360
Hashtag "Peter is my bachelor."
Hashtag: "he's-a-catch-elor."

219
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,080
Arpaio will do anything
for a camera.

220
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,280
Watch him sing his favorite song
of course, is Frank Sinatra's "My Way",

221
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,120
the universal anthem
of assholes everywhere.

222
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,360
Watch him sing it
for a documentary film crew.

223
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,080
The record shows
I took the blows,

224
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,800
And did it my way !

225
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,840
Something interesting there:
when Frank Sinatra heard that,

226
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,800
he climbed out of his grave,
walked 400 miles to Arpaio's house,

227
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,280
rang the doorbell
and simply said: "no".

228
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,960
But what does "doing it Arpaio's way"
actually mean ?

229
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,080
Trump didn't just pardon him,
he touted Arpaio's support on campaign,

230
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,040
even having him speak
at the Republican convention.

231
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,960
Trump doesn't seem to have any
problem with "Arpaio's way".

232
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,720
It is more than just the eye-catching
circus that you've seen so far.

233
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,440
Maricopa County, where he was
the sheriff until just last year,

234
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,640
contains over
four million people.

235
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,880
That's a higher population
than that of 24 states.

236
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,240
And conditions in his
Tent City were appalling.

237
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,800
Temperatures there could rise
as high as 145 degrees,

238
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,000
food was limited to two meals a day
and then there was this.

239
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,640
Chinese law enforcement officials
drop in for some tips from Joe,

240
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,280
who brushed up on his Mandarin.

241
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,640
I hear China very tough
on criminal, correct ?

242
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,120
I'm asking them, in China do they
put women on a chain gang ?

243
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,160
No.

244
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,240
Thank you. I am still
the first in the world.

245
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,000
Yes, Arpaio actually put women
on chain gangs. So, I guess...

246
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:03,160
Hashtag Feminism ?
It's a gray area.

247
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,880
Arpaio operates jails, not prisons,
and jails are typically for people

248
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,840
serving sentences of less than
a year, or even awaiting trial.

249
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,000
Which is not to say anyone should be
subjected to Arpaio's treatment.

250
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,320
He installed webcams in the jail,
which showed inmates using the toilet,

251
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,440
which wound up being linked
to by pornographic sites.

252
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,840
While the cameras were pulled, the
sheriff's office defended themselves,

253
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,800
with their lawyer saying they did
not show the private parts of inmates

254
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,400
and "no juveniles would
have been displayed"

255
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,640
"unless they
look older and lie to us."

256
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:44,440
Spare a thought for the attorney
who went through years of law school

257
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,280
only to have to tell a reporter:

258
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,600
"the women we broadcast taking
a shit were probably all adults."

259
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,720
Arpaio seemed impervious
to criticism of any of his tactics.

260
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,320
I have not received
many negative comments,

261
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,920
other than the Justice Department
or Amnesty International

262
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,960
or the Civil Liberties Union.

263
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:11,000
The 3 key groups who might criticize
you over mistreating prisoners.

264
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,840
So you just went three for three
on that one.

265
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,000
You're not going to get complaints
from Carl's Jr., the Girl Scouts

266
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,480
and Hootie and the Blowfish,
that's not what those groups do.

267
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,560
So, is it any wonder that,
when a reporter asked inmates

268
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,840
whether Arpaio had nicknames,
one responded: "Hitler",

269
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,000
while another responded:
"Hitler".

270
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,280
That is a charge that he's defended
himself against by saying:

271
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,880
"my daughter has adopted
children of various ethnicities..."

272
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,160
"I got a black, a Mexican
with Down Syndrome even."

273
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,640
"And yet I'm the racist, I'm
the fascist, I'm the Hitler !"

274
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,120
I'm not going to argue
with him on that one.

275
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,120
That is sound logic. That is why when
you play "Guess Who's The Hitler ?"

276
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,800
the first things you ask
to narrow it down are:

277
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,760
"do their daughter got a black ?"

278
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,320
and "do their daughter got a Mexican
with Down Syndrome even ?"

279
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,920
Because if their daughter got those,
they can't be the Hitler !

280
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,720
It's right there in the rules !

281
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:13,200
Arpaio's jails weren't just tough,
they were sometimes deadly.

282
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,960
The county paid
multiple large settlements to families

283
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,560
of inmates who've died following
incidents in his facilities,

284
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,800
including over $8 million
to the family of Scott Norberg,

285
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,520
who died in custody after being
restrained, shocked, and beaten.

286
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,200
When one officer tried to warn
two other guards

287
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,680
the inmate was in dire trouble,
their response was chilling.

288
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:40,040
I told him he was turning blue or
purple I don't think he was breathing.

289
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,000
And he said:
"who gives a fuck ?"

290
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,440
After Spidell responded to you
"who gives a fuck ?"

291
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,640
and you warned Officer Gurney,
what did Mr. Gurney say ?

292
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,760
They said,
just "who gives a shit ?"

293
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,480
You can't see someone dying
and say who gives a shit.

294
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,680
You can't even see some thing
dying and say that.

295
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,720
With the sole exception of orchids.
Because, really, who gives a shit ?

296
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,040
They're high maintenance little
flower cucks and they deserve to die.

297
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,840
Justice Department declined
to prosecute that case,

298
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,520
and both Arpaio and the officers
insisted they did nothing wrong.

299
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,280
Arpaio was so unapologetic
that both officer "who gives a fuck"

300
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,680
and officer "who gives a shit"
were later promoted.

301
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,080
To Lieutenant "whatever, asshole"
and Sergeant "zero fucks given."

302
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,960
That promotion sends a pretty
clear message to Arpaio's staff.

303
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,280
Almost as clear a message
as a president pardoning

304
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,320
the man who oversaw all of this.

305
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:47,840
Arpaio wasn't just in charge of jails.
He was also a law enforcement officer,

306
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,280
though his respect for the law
seemed awfully selective.

307
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,160
Over the years, his office
repeatedly launched criminal cases

308
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,880
against his perceived enemies,
county officials or even judges,

309
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,520
some of which were so flimsy,
they were dismissed or thrown out.

310
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,160
One civil suit that he brought
turned out to be so baseless,

311
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,160
it was cited in the disbarment
of the attorney who brought it,

312
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,200
with a member of the disbarment
panel saying it was:

313
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,600
"nothing short
of fumbling with the law,"

314
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,280
"like children wielding
a buzzing chainsaw."

315
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,440
Not only an amazing statement, it's
my favorite Precious Moments figurine.

316
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,680
For "America's Toughest Sheriff",

317
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,360
Arpaio seemed to let certain crimes
fall through the cracks.

318
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,040
In 2011, his department
failed to properly investigate

319
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,040
more than 400 sex crimes,
some of which involved children.

320
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:45,080
While Arpaio admitted to that,
his apology left a lot to be desired.

321
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,880
If there were any victims out there,

322
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,760
I apologize to those victims,
if there were any.

323
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,760
"If there were any" ?
There were, we know that.

324
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,960
That is a casual indifference to
overlooking sex crimes so egregious,

325
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,520
I am surprised that Penn State
hasn't erected a statue of him.

326
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:12,720
None of what you have just seen,
not the conditions, not the deaths,

327
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,360
not the baseless charges
against his critic, has anything to do

328
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,000
with why he was convicted
and needed a pardon.

329
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,520
That stems from racial profiling

330
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:28,200
and one huge investigation made
some really troubling allegations.

331
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,040
A three-year investigation
by the Justice Department found

332
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,720
what it called
"unconstitutional policing"

333
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,560
and a "pervasive culture of
discriminatory bias against Latinos",

334
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,960
who are up to nine times more likely
than whites to be stopped by a deputy.

335
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:49,440
A Hispanic driver was incarcerated
for 13 days

336
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,960
before his citation was dismissed
for not using his turn signal.

337
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:00,400
13 days for a turn signal infraction !
And that is in Arizona,

338
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,480
where an old person driving
with their turn signal on

339
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,320
is literally their state seal.

340
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,120
In 2011, a lawsuit alleging

341
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,920
his department had a pattern of
racial profiling resulted in this.

342
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,840
A federal court decided Arizona
authorities cannot arrest people

343
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,760
suspected of being illegal immigrants
solely on their appearance.

344
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,440
If Arpaio does not comply
with the court ruling

345
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,560
Arpaio could be held in contempt
of court and face jail time.

346
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:34,400
You'll never guess what happened.
Arpaio did not comply.

347
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,640
Over the next 18 months, his office
detained 171 people without charge

348
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,480
and turned them over
to immigration enforcement.

349
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,480
Last July, a federal judge found
Arpaio guilty of criminal contempt.

350
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,760
And at that point,
he was a criminal.

351
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,720
He had committed
and was convicted of a crime.

352
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,680
The thing that the people he put in
tents and pink underwear had done

353
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,400
and which he felt meant they had
forfeited any right to complain.

354
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,640
He hadn't even been sentenced before
Trump started hinting at a pardon

355
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,680
for a frankly incredible reason.

356
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,040
Was Sheriff Joe convicted
for doing his job ?

357
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,840
I'll make a prediction. I think
he's going to be just fine. Okay ?

358
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:28,920
He was not just doing his job.
He was also doing something illegal.

359
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,640
You wouldn't say John Wayne Gacy
was "just doing his job"

360
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,040
even though he was
a pretty good birthday clown.

361
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,440
It's the stuff he was doing on top
of that that needed addressing.

362
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,160
I do not doubt that Trump thinks
everything Joe Arpaio did was,

363
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,200
or should be, part of a law
enforcement officer's job.

364
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:54,920
That is why this pardon is a slap
in the face to Latinos

365
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,520
that Arpaio and his department
unconstitutionally targeted.

366
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,760
and to the very rule
of law itself.

367
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,720
Arpaio broke the rules
he was sworn to uphold,

368
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,200
rules put in place to protect citizens
from a government going out of control.

369
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,960
And Trump giving him a pass,
after everything that you have seen

370
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,480
and saying that he was
"just doing his job"

371
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,800
is a loud confirmation that, as far
as this White House is concerned,

372
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,840
for the next years, law enforcement
won't necessarily be expected

373
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,800
to do their jobs the way
the constitution or the courts say.

374
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,040
Instead, like Sheriff Joe Arpaio,
they should absolutely feel free

375
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,000
to do their job....
what's the term ?

376
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:42,520
My way. Yes.

377
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,640
And now, this.

378
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:53,120
Joe Arpaio sings another song with
no sense of irony whatsoever.

379
00:24:53,560 --> 00:25:00,000
I'm gonna make it to heaven.
Light up the sky like a flame.

380
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:06,160
I'm gonna live forever.
Baby, remember my name.

381
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,920
Finally tonight, I'd like to give you
a quick word regarding trains.

382
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,160
Or, as I call them
"groundplanes".

383
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:27,120
One of our recent "And Now" segments
concerned Scranton's WNEP.

384
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:32,640
Their backyard train that runs
behind their weather forecasters.

385
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,560
It is a charming feature,

386
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,400
and the people of Scranton
have a lot of opinions about it,

387
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,880
regularly calling in during
their "Talkback" segment.

388
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,600
Talkback callers seem to be obsessed
with the train and trolley.

389
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,160
I would like to know whose idea
it was to put a train in the backyard.

390
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,600
I'm calling about your train.
Keep the train rolling, baby !

391
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,960
What is going on with the train ?
It hasn't been running in weeks.

392
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,000
I wish Snedeker would put

393
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,480
a quarter-stick
in the train and blow it up.

394
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:19,480
That level of emotional investment
in a toy train set is only experienced

395
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,720
by middle-aged dads divorced
or about to get divorced.

396
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,600
The people of Scranton
saw our segment on them.

397
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,640
The reason I know that is this.

398
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,080
Our train getting
national attention.

399
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,320
Some folks love it, some feel
it's at our area's expense.

400
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:43,080
I just watched this
John Oliver train controversy.

401
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,360
This guy...  We're not clowns
for his entertainment.

402
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,080
I think this guy owes us
an apology here in NEPA.

403
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,280
First, look, let me be clear:

404
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,480
I do not think residents of Scranton
are "clowns for my entertainment".

405
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,400
I don't think clowns
are for entertainment at all.

406
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,640
They are for murder threats, attempted
murder and actual murder. That's it.

407
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,680
That's what clowns are for.
So, please, as well...

408
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,880
Don't think that I was making fun.
I fucking love that backyard train

409
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,320
and I also love how passionate
you all are about it.

410
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,600
Let me prove it to you. Because
my only criticism of your train set

411
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,080
is that I think you deserve
a better one, a bigger one.

412
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,080
An almost irresponsibly
large one.

413
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,560
And that is why,
and I hope you don't mind,

414
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,360
we have used HBO's resources
to make you something special.

415
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,680
Please, come with me,
because I have something to show you

416
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,520
that I'm pretty sure
you are going to like.

417
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,400
Scranton, look at this !

418
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,560
It's not the train set
that Scranton needs,

419
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,840
but it is the train set
that it deserves.

420
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,600
This thing spins around,

421
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,520
it has every Scranton landmark
that we could find on Google.

422
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,760
It's all there. The Scranton sign,
the Electric City building,

423
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,160
multiple other Scranton landmarks.

424
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,800
I know you have a waterfall, that's
why this thing has a fucking waterfall.

425
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,480
There's three levels of trains.
There's the Tunkannock Viaduct,

426
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,880
the Penn Paper building
from "The Office", right there.

427
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,840
The Times building
and radio tower is there,

428
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,920
and we wouldn't miss the Lackawanna
Station Hotel and Coal Mine Tour.

429
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,400
And this thing even
has a train tunnel

430
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,480
in the shape of Scranton's famous son,
basketball coach PJ Carlesimo.

431
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:44,120
Look at this beautiful thing !
We built it for you !

432
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,480
Seriously, this is yours now.
You need to come and get it.

433
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,480
It can't stay here.
So, please:

434
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,280
WNEP, call us to arrange pickup
or delivery

435
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,960
of the greatest backyard train
that local news has ever seen.

436
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,200
This thing also catches fire.
Something you should probably know.

437
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,680
That's our show,
thank you so much for watching.

438
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,880
We'll see you two week's time.
Good night !

439
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,960
It's yours, Scranton !

440
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,840
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

441
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,240
END OF EPISODE 23,
SEASON IV
