LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,560
Season IV
Episode 28

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,080
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,280
Thank you for joining us,
we begin with President Trump,

5
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,040
the person who most deserves
to look like that.

6
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,200
I know, right now,
all anyone can think about

7
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,480
is the reported indictments
coming from Robert Mueller:

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,880
please, let it be Jared !

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,960
A lot has happened this week,

10
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,320
including Trump addressing
America's opioid crisis,

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,960
which claims 140 lives every day
or, as one newscaster put it...

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,320
Good evening.
I'm Anthony Mason.

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,760
By the time this broadcast is over,
three people will be dead.

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,840
Holy shit ! The only thing
creepier than that

15
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,360
is if he specifically named
who those people are.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,880
Three people will be dead: Jason Kohler
of Waltham,Massachusetts,

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,800
Diane Forant of Spokane, Washington,
and you.

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,360
Combating opioid crisis was one
of Trump's central campaign promises.

19
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,120
A lot of his solutions
were underwhelming,

20
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,120
including one of the key
announcements on Thursday.

21
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,920
It's really easy not to take 'em.

22
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,440
That's going to be
our most important thing.

23
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,080
Really tough,
really big, really great advertising,

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,960
so we get to people
before they start.

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,400
So, an ad campaign.

26
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,560
It is important not to start
abusing opioids,

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,360
but that doesn't help the people
who are struggling with addiction.

28
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,400
It's like seeing someone neck deep
in quicksand and then putting up

29
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,440
a "don't do quicksand" sign.

30
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,760
The whole ad-blitz strategy has
famously been tried, and failed,

31
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,320
with Nancy Reagan's
"Just Say No" campaign.

32
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,080
It still seems to be
Trump's preferred approach,

33
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,640
going by what happened
at one of his rallies.

34
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,640
Don't take drugs. Okay ?
Raise your hand.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,480
I promise Donald J. Trump.

36
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,600
That I will never take drugs.

37
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,320
I don't want to say no alcohol,
but take it easy on the alcohol !

38
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,520
What are you doing ?

39
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,240
Why are you walking back
the pledge as you go ?

40
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,480
He would be a terrible
wedding officiant.

41
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,200
Do you take this woman, I don't
want to say 'forsaking all others',

42
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,400
there are gonna be others,
but take it easy on the others.

43
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,280
Don't let them call you at home.

44
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,560
It is good that the president is
calling attention to the opioid crisis.

45
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,040
The problem is, attention
is pretty much all he's giving it.

46
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,520
He didn't put out a detailed strategy
and his splashiest step

47
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,000
declaring it
a "public health emergency",

48
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,400
doesn't do very much.

49
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,040
It will streamline some access
to addiction treatment,

50
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,320
but provides
few new resources.

51
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,000
Financing comes from
the Public Health Emergency Fund,

52
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,640
which has a balance
of just over $56 000.

53
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:30,800
The federal government estimates
the crisis costs $75 billion annually.

54
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,640
Trump chimed in with his two cents
about how to tackle this crisis,

55
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,440
and it involves allotting for the
2,6 million Americans addicted,

56
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,520
literally about two cents each.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,560
Trump's fix for our opioids
epidemic essentially boils down to:

58
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,560
"Here's two pennies.
Throw them in a mall fountain"

59
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,520
"and wish your addiction away."

60
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,080
Let's turn to Alabama,
the South's "The South".

61
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,480
On December 12th,
they are holding a special election

62
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,280
for the Senate seat left open
by Attorney General Jeff Sessions,

63
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,120
a position he will be leaving any day
now for his regular holiday job.

64
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,680
This special election
has gotten a lot of buzz,

65
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,720
because the Republican candidate

66
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,000
is former Alabama Supreme Court
Chief Justice Roy Moore.

67
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,840
And he is a lot.

68
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,440
He's called American Indians "Reds"
and Asian Americans "Yellows".

69
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,840
He's called Islam a false religion.
Homosexual activity should be illegal.

70
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,360
He reportedly said in February
that the 9/11 attacks

71
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,200
might have been punishment for
America's turning away from God.

72
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,600
And on Monday, he caused
a stir by waving a gun.

73
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,040
I believe
in the second amendment.

74
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,600
During a campaign rally.

75
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,960
He also personally
kicked a panda in the balls

76
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,000
and he once called Tom Hanks
the n-word.

77
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,720
Just in case you thought
he couldn't get any worse,

78
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,680
Moore is also an aspiring poet.

79
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,360
Listen to him recite a poem
he calls "America the Beautiful."

80
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,400
America, the beautiful,
Or so you used to be.

81
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,640
Land of the pilgrims' pride.
I'm glad they're not here to see

82
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,520
Babies piled in dumpsters,
Abortion on demand.

83
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,360
Sweet land of liberty,
Your house is on the sand.

84
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,640
I don't support everything Roy Moore
says, but we can all agree:

85
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,840
that is objectively good poetry.

86
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,000
I would say that's the best use
of dumpster baby imagery

87
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,000
since Frost's "Stopping by a Dumpster
Full of Babies on a Snowy Evening."

88
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,160
Whose babies these are,
I think I know.

89
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,800
His babies are in the dumpster,
though.

90
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,600
He will not see me stopping here,
To say

91
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,640
"Holy shit,
this dumpster is full of babies."

92
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,280
Listen to Moore's feelings
on homosexuality.

93
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,920
As bad as you assume they are,
they're worse.

94
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,720
He favors criminalizing sodomy
and if you ask him about that,

95
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,280
things get weird fast.

96
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,320
Sodomy is against the law of nature.
Ok, let's take another one.

97
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,320
Is there a right
in the Constitution for bestiality ?

98
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,640
There is no right in
the constitution to commit bestiality.

99
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,400
There's nothing that says a man
can have sex with a donkey.

100
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,600
Or a woman can have sex
with a donkey, right ?

101
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,400
It's not in there.

102
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,000
Say what you will about Roy Moore,
he is a man who believes

103
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,440
that a woman can fuck a donkey
every bit as well as a man.

104
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,320
And that is something. Hashtag
tap that ass. Hashtag feminism.

105
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,840
Moore has also stoked
fear of Muslims,

106
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,320
suggesting Keith Ellison's faith should
prevent him from serving in Congress.

107
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,560
Now luckily, Republicans in both
the House and the Senate

108
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,520
condemned Moore
and his views,

109
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,480
have even gone so far as to...
I'm obviously kidding !

110
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,400
He entered into a fundraising
agreement with the RNC

111
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,120
and multiple Republican senators
are fundraising on his behalf.

112
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,600
If you are wondering
why they would do that,

113
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,080
I'll let Texas senator
John Cornyn explain.

114
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,000
Have you seen these comments

115
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,200
when he said that homosexual
conduct should be illegal ?

116
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,680
Do you agree with that ?

117
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,080
I don't have to agree with somebody

118
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,840
to support them
over the Democratic nominee.

119
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,400
I support the nominee of my party.

120
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,480
But that kind of blind loyalty

121
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,080
means there is nobody
you would not support.

122
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,280
If the Republican Party nominated
a swarm of smallpox-infected bees,

123
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,880
John Cornyn would say
"we disagree on a lot of things,"

124
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,720
"but all those bees
is a reliable vote on tax cuts."

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,120
"I support the nominee
of my party."

126
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,680
Even senators
who are not publicly supporting Moore

127
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,400
are hardly condemning him.

128
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,360
Here are their reactions after being
asked to comment on his campaign.

129
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,320
Senator Dean Heller of Nevada:

130
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,160
"Who won ? I wasn't paying attention.
I'm just worried about taxes."

131
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,840
Senator Rob Portman of Ohio:
"He's going to be for tax reform..."

132
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,800
"I don't know him." Senator
Tim Scott of South Carolina:

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,800
"I'm not going to comment.
I have not followed that race."

134
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,360
I haven't followed that one ?
Come on.

135
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,120
This is your own party's senate
candidate, not "Ray Donovan".

136
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,360
I haven't been following that one.
What is his character ?

137
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,800
The poster gives me nothing !
Is he an assassin ? A sommelier ?

138
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,040
An uncle showing up drunk
at a christening ?

139
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,720
A member of the Wahlberg family ?
I'll never find out.

140
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,920
If any of that made you feel sad
about the state of our democracy,

141
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,960
spare a thought for Australia:

142
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,160
not the birthplace of
Outback Steakhouse

143
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,160
but very much the Outback
Steakhouse of countries.

144
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,120
Australia is in the midst
of a major vote of its own.

145
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,640
16 million Australians
are being asked to vote

146
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,120
in a postal survey
on same sex marriage.

147
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,920
The Australian government
is conducting a postal survey

148
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,640
on whether same-sex marriage
should be legal.

149
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,960
Polls already exist, showing around
two-thirds of Australians support it.

150
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,440
Parliament could simply
pass it into law.

151
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,040
They are inexplicably holding
a non-legally-binding postal vote

152
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,520
at a public cost of $120 million,
which is the weirdest waste of money

153
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,320
since every Baz Luhrman
movie ever made.

154
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,120
The ballots are due by November 7th
and the campaign has been toxic,

155
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,760
with members of parliament
delivering ridiculous arguments.

156
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,480
There are all sorts
of relationships.

157
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,440
I have an affectionate relationship
with you, Sam.

158
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,840
We're not married.

159
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,440
- That's right, we're not married.
- You have a very lovely wife.

160
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,800
I have an affectionate
relationship with my cycling mates,

161
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,280
who we go cycling,
but that's not marriage.

162
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,760
We do fuck. We finish cycling,
we peel our cycling clothes off

163
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,680
by the side of the bucolic
country road and we fuck.

164
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,960
That's not marriage.
That's fucking your cycling mates.

165
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,840
That's different your cycling mates.
It's not marriage.

166
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,440
You cycle, you fuck.
It's not marriage though.

167
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:17,160
One activist seemed unusually
obsessed with terminology.

168
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,120
Ladies and gentlemen,

169
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,280
if I may still use that term
in these gender fluid times.

170
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,880
I speak for marriage.

171
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,200
Speaking against same-sex marriage
is Sophie York from Marriage Alliance,

172
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,080
which says unions of same-sex
couples shouldn't be called marriage.

173
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,320
That idea of having a different word
has been floated and it still will be

174
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,880
and someone else put forth
the word "garriage" as a possibility.

175
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,680
"Garriage".
That is a stupid word,

176
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,080
except in the rare case of a wedding
between two men named Gary,

177
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,880
in which case, they should be
getting "garried".

178
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,960
As stupid as that is, it is the sort
of argument you would expect.

179
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,880
The "no" campaign has had
some surprising members.

180
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,720
I used to be a supporter.
I proposed to Ben five years ago.

181
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:21,160
I explained to him. I said:
"I don't think it's my cup of tea".

182
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,680
Even if same-sex marriage
is legalized,

183
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,240
Mark and Ben
won't be walking down the aisle.

184
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,920
If it's yes, congratulations.
Everyone can get married.

185
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,440
We will not be getting married.
We'll stand by our commitment.

186
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,760
We don't need marriage
in our lives. Definitely not.

187
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,280
Two things: Ben ?
You are cold blooded !

188
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,040
Mark, you can do
so much better than him.

189
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,960
You deserve someone as committed
to you, as you are to them.

190
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,720
This relationship is going nowhere.
Don't stay together for the dog.

191
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,200
He knows you're unhappy, too !
Respect yourself, Mark, and leave.

192
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,960
Get yourself on Australian Grindr
and swipe,

193
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,840
the exact opposite
direction than we do.

194
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,800
This whole debate got so heated,
it even spilled over

195
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,000
into Australian rugby's version
of the Super Bowl.

196
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,000
An online petition is calling on
the league to stop rapper Macklemore

197
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,040
from performing his gay rights
song "Same Love"

198
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,520
as part of Sunday's
final entertainment.

199
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,640
That is putting me
in a tough position.

200
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,680
I support gay marriage,
but I refuse to ever say:

201
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,600
"let Macklemore perform !"

202
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,560
His music belongs in one place
and that is the Pandora station:

203
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,120
"Now That's What
Your Mom Calls Rap Music".

204
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,200
Let's not pretend Australia
has high standards

205
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,640
of who performs
at their sporting events.

206
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,120
Not after this memorable performance
at the 2011 AFL Grand Final.

207
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,280
Step aside, Buddy Holly,
Richie Valens and the Big Bopper.

208
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,080
There is a new
"the day the music died" in town.

209
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,120
Fighting the debate with
words and songs is one thing.

210
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,160
The progay-marriage head
of Qantas got pied in the face,

211
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,160
while the anti-gay-marriage
former Prime Minister Tony Abbott,

212
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,840
a man whose very smile says:
"smell that ? I just cut one"

213
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,040
had an unfortunate incident
on the street.

214
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,600
A gentleman sang out:
"Hey, Tony."

215
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,080
I turned around, he said:
"I want to shake your hand."

216
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,360
I saw him coming towards me.
I held out my hand,

217
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,240
he grabbed my hand
and it turned into a head-butt.

218
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:22,000
Tony Abbott was head-butted
by this man, a Tasmanian anarchist

219
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,600
who goes by the names
"Astro Labe"

220
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,080
and, even better, "DJ Funknukl".

221
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,800
According to DJ Funknukl

222
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,840
the attack wasn't connected
with the gay marriage issue.

223
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,000
It has nothing to do
with marriage equality.

224
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,120
Someone
had stuck a sticker on my jacket.

225
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,720
I was thinking, there's Tony Abbott,
I'll head-butt him.

226
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,560
Here's the important thing.

227
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,480
I am in no way condoning
Tony Abbott being attacked.

228
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,360
Thinking to yourself: "there's
Tony Abbot, I'll head-butt him"

229
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,640
is entirely natural,
it's an automatic human response.

230
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,320
It's like "there's a puppy,
I'm going to pet it"

231
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,440
or "there's Sean Penn,
I'm not going to see that movie."

232
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,480
This has been a dispiriting,
ultimately pointless process,

233
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,800
and there are only two good things
that could come out of it:

234
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,800
one is if Australia's parliament
legalizes gay marriage.

235
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,960
And two, that Mark heeds my words
and puts himself out there

236
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,320
and meets someone
who deserves him.

237
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,560
Mark, you can find someone
who would do anything for love,

238
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,720
including that.

239
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,960
And now this.

240
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,520
If it makes Australia feel better,

241
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,480
here's Meat Loaf butchering
"America the Beautiful".

242
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,160
Mitt Romney !

243
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,480
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns floods.

244
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,520
They are clearly catastrophic,
traumatic events.

245
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,200
They've also been responsible for
one of the most memorable clips

246
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,200
in the history of broadcast news.

247
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,560
Good morning ! We're getting
a nice break from the rain,

248
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,040
but not the flooding.

249
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,360
This is essentially now a part
of the Passaic River.

250
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,600
That's it, fuck James Cameron.
And fuck "Titanic".

251
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,840
That is the greatest boat
disaster ever captured on film.

252
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:51,280
Floods were everywhere this summer.
The "Despacito" of natural disasters:

253
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,480
persistent, ubiquitous and no fault of
the Puerto Rican government.

254
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:01,520
90% of all natural disasters
in the U.S. involve a flood,

255
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,960
which is the reason FEMA's website
once referred to flooding

256
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,360
as "America's #1 Natural Hazard,
exclamation mark !"

257
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,840
Which is a pretty weird tone to take
when describing something horrible.

258
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,200
It's like saying: "Boils:
America's #1 Staph Infection !"

259
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,760
or "Parks: America's #1 Place
To Die Unnoticed !"

260
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,840
Floods are only going to get
worse, due to climate change.

261
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,720
People will dispute that, we don't
have time tonight to litigate

262
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,200
whether extreme weather events
are exacerbated,

263
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,920
so for now, let's just say...

264
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,280
They are.

265
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:42,520
Yeah, they just definitely are.
It is a complicated issue

266
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,320
and we may not have definitive
proof until the late 1980s.

267
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,600
While floods are often referred to
as natural disasters, the truth is,

268
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,720
the damage they do is often
within our control,

269
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,360
we have made decisions that put
and keep people and property

270
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,240
in the path of flooding
and that is what this story is about.

271
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,760
Let's acknowledge that people live
near water for all sorts of reasons.

272
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,040
It's where their families lived,
or a necessity for the work.

273
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,760
For others, it's a luxury and living
next to the water is attractive,

274
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,680
despite the risks like flooding
or stepping on pointy seashells

275
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,600
or mistakenly giving a Tostito
to a seagull,

276
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,200
means that you will spend your life
haunted by a Tostito-addicted seagull.

277
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,640
Whatever the reason
to live by the water, many do it...

278
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,160
For fuck's sake !
I don't have any Tostitos !

279
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,680
I've been telling you that
for six years. Look ? No Tostitos !

280
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,920
Get out of here,
you flying beach rat !

281
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,120
Sorry !

282
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,080
Dangers of waterfront
living are real.

283
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,960
But many people, like this man
who lives on the water in Tampa Bay,

284
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,240
feel the benefits outweigh the risks.

285
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,120
Mark knows that life here is tenuous.
But he doesn't dwell on it.

286
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,680
Every morning when I walk out
to get the paper, I see dolphins,

287
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,960
and Roseate Spoonbills walking
around the edge of the Bayou,

288
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,480
so, it tends to make you forget
about all those sorts of things.

289
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,800
Seeing a Roseate Spoonbill would take
your mind off things,

290
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,440
you're spending your day
trying to figure out

291
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,240
how a flamingo could have gotten
its face stuck into a panini press.

292
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,240
Even people who like birds
don't like this bird.

293
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,320
The Audubon Society
an organization who champions birds

294
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,320
says they are: "gorgeous at a distance
and bizarre up close."

295
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,640
Which is like the American
Kennel Club saying:

296
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,040
"we celebrate all dogs and honor
them as man's best friend,"

297
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,800
"but the Dandie Dinmont
has a trash personality"

298
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,600
"and looks like a Scottie
fucked Phil Spector."

299
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:03,080
If you are overlooking a bayou,
you are aware that flooding is a risk.

300
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,600
But not every flood-prone area
is directly along the coast.

301
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,360
Aggressive development can
exacerbate the risk of flooding.

302
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,880
Look at Houston, which
was recently rocked by Harvey.

303
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,960
The metro area's development
exploded. One study found

304
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,000
the Houston area added
25% more pavement over 15 years,

305
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,320
replacing soil-rich wetlands
with concrete-covered suburbia.

306
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:36,000
That made Harvey's damage worse.
Concrete isn't good at absorbing water.

307
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,280
Why people don't dry off at the beach
by rolling around in the parking lot.

308
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,960
It's not just global warming
or unchecked growth

309
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,040
that have put more people
in risky, flood prone areas.

310
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,760
It's also the fact that it's possible
for people to take that risk

311
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,920
because they have
flood insurance.

312
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,240
Look at "Buying the Beach", a show
for people who want to live near water.

313
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,680
One episode featured two brothers
named Mitch and Daniel,

314
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,120
arguing over a particular house,
which led to this exchange.

315
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,080
What'd you think about
the island house ?

316
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,520
There was a lot of good
and a lot of bad on it.

317
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,160
- Off those steps: into the beach.
- We are close to the water.

318
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,440
- That's got me concerned.
- That's what insurance is for.

319
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:24,040
That may be the most reckless
statement ever said on a boat.

320
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,880
And I am very much including:

321
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,200
"I can definitely
make this shot work",

322
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,360
and "let's feed these gulls
some Tostitos !"

323
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,880
I don't have any !
All I did was say the word !

324
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,400
Get out of here ! No Tostitos !

325
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,520
But Mitch... No Tostitos !

326
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:50,920
Mitch isn't wrong that, they
could get flood insurance cheaply.

327
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,720
And it's worth taking some time
to understand why that is the case.

328
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,400
Unlike other forms of
homeowner's insurance,

329
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,800
flood protection is underwritten
by the government through

330
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,640
the NFIP,
or "National Flood Insurance Program".

331
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,040
It started 50 years ago,
after historic floods wiped out

332
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,040
many people's homes
in the 1960s.

333
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,680
There was a problem: insurance
companies wouldn't cover floods,

334
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,800
it was too risky.

335
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,160
Government was spending way
too much on disaster relief.

336
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:27,080
So they created the NFIP,
which offered discounted insurance.

337
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,720
And that sounds great.
But crucially,

338
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:35,040
the aim was not that people would be
staying in at-risk homes permanently,

339
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,960
as the program's current
administrator explains.

340
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,440
They presumed that if we told people
they were at risk, they would move.

341
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,160
They presumed
that over the life of the program,

342
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,960
those discounts
wouldn't need to be continued

343
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,760
because once people knew they
had the risk they would move out.

344
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,480
That has not proven true.

345
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,560
No, but of course it hasn't.
That's not how people work.

346
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,680
We will accept huge risks
for the sake of a discount.

347
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,920
That was the premise behind
the McDonald's dollar menu.

348
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,360
That is one of the many flaws with
how this program was designed.

349
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,360
Because everything about it
from who participates,

350
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,640
to the incentives it creates,
needs fixing.

351
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,240
And let's start with the fact
that eligibility for the program

352
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,560
is determined
through floodplain maps.

353
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,880
You are required
to buy flood insurance

354
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,440
if you have a federally-backed
mortgage and FEMA's maps show

355
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,960
you live in a risky area.

356
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:40,400
Lots of people
don't buy insurance who should.

357
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,040
The maps can be both out of date
and wildly inaccurate.

358
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,800
Days before Harvey struck,
a study of Houston-area flood maps

359
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,440
was published
and the results were alarming.

360
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,200
Researchers at Rice University and
Texas A&M Galveston studied

361
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,560
one section
of Southeast Harris County.

362
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,560
FEMA's flood plain maps missed
about 75 percent of the damages.

363
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,600
75 percent ! You might as well
predict floods

364
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:14,560
by having blindfolded 6-year-olds
pin little cardboard puddles.

365
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,600
Even if the maps were perfect,
there would be another flaw

366
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,880
with the NFIP,
how it's administered.

367
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,920
The government
doesn't directly insure you.

368
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,680
It pays private insurance companies
a fee for every policy they sell.

369
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,600
The federal government is responsible
for covering any losses.

370
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,160
Which is a sweet deal
for those companies.

371
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,800
They take none of the risk
and yet, they get all the rewards.

372
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,880
They also get paid
for each claim they handle.

373
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,440
And when Frontline
crunched some of the numbers,

374
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,680
they found something shocking.

375
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,640
There was one number
that really jumped out.

376
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,320
With all the claims
in the wake of Sandy,

377
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,680
the profits were more
than 400 million dollars.

378
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,960
They're handling a lot
of claims that year

379
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,520
and they make a lot of money
when they do that.

380
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,280
When a big storm hits,
they make more money ?

381
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,640
Yeah, at the very time you need
them to make less money,

382
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,720
because the burden is going
to be borne by the taxpayers.

383
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,040
For insurance companies,

384
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,160
the bigger the disaster,
the more they stand to profit.

385
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,120
A business model not seen outside
of Nicolas Cage's career.

386
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,280
While the insurance industry may
dispute how much profit they make,

387
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,240
the government and the taxpayer
are the ones eating the losses.

388
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,120
Which is one of the reasons why,
even before these latest hurricanes,

389
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,080
the program
was $25 billion in debt.

390
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,360
And there are not enough
Roseate Spoonbills in the world

391
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,000
to take your mind
off that and just to be clear,

392
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,360
there are exactly enough
Roseate Spoonbills in the world.

393
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,160
Do we all really need
more of this ?

394
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,960
Kids, come see !

395
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,360
The dirty pink dinosaur is noisily
devouring its young !

396
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,560
Helping people after a disaster
is what government is for.

397
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,800
A big chunk of that money
is going to the insurance companies.

398
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,000
Another, shockingly big chunk
goes to very few homes.

399
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,640
Along the Gulf Coast and Florida,
one percent of properties covered

400
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,560
have accounted
for a quarter of flood claims.

401
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,080
These are so-called
"repetitive loss properties".

402
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,960
They are homes that can flood
over and over again.

403
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,400
Some of them
are costing us a fortune.

404
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:47,520
Washington Post highlighted
a home in Pointe Coupee Parish

405
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,160
that has flooded 40 times.

406
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,480
The house is valued at just
$56 000,

407
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,960
NFIP has doled out nearly
$430 000 to cover flood claims.

408
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,280
That is just stupid.
If your house floods 40 times,

409
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,320
Mother Nature is sending you
a pretty clear message:

410
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,120
"You mind leaving ? Some weird fish
would like to fuck in here now."

411
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,560
Some parts of the country
have extreme examples of this.

412
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,760
Remember Mitch and Daniel ?
The deathtrap that they were looking at

413
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,880
is on Dauphin Island,
where over the past two decades,

414
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,000
homeowners have
"paid just $9.3 million in premiums",

415
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:33,320
"but they've received $72.2 million
in payments for their damaged homes."

416
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,080
The island got written up by
Bloomberg under the headline:

417
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,880
"Love Of Coastal Living Is
Draining U.S. Disaster Funds",

418
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,360
and at first glance,
we thought, hold on:

419
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,000
isn't that the same eyesore on stilts
that Mitch and Daniel almost bought ?

420
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,840
The good news is it's actually not.
The bad news is,

421
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:57,080
it's the house next door, was also
featured on a different episode.

422
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,520
It's right in the water.

423
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,160
It wasn't close to the beach,
it was in the ocean.

424
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,520
The waves
are just right here.

425
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,400
It's literally in the ocean.
This is insane.

426
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,360
Yeah, it is insane.
But what's even crazier is,

427
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,680
at the end of the episode,
they decided to buy that house.

428
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,560
Even if you were able to overlook
the repetitive loss properties,

429
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:29,200
nearly one out of every five homes
covered under the NFIP

430
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,840
is a second home.

431
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,360
Because the program
isn't means-tested,

432
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,280
the benefits frequently go to
wealthy individuals' vacation homes.

433
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,800
One property belonged to
John Stossel: a Fox News personality

434
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,200
and partially hydrogenated
Tom Selleck.

435
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,440
I'll let Stossel, who answers
the question:

436
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:50,120
"what if Freddie Mercury became
manager at Men's Warehouse ?",

437
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,800
I'll let him tell you all about it,
he knew it was ridiculous.

438
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,040
Years ago I built this beach house.
That's younger me, there.

439
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,360
The house was on the edge
of the Atlantic Ocean.

440
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,200
A risky place to build,
but I built anyway,

441
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,960
'cause a federal program
guaranteed my investment.

442
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,240
A storm swept away my first floor,
but I didn't lose a penny.

443
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,360
I never invited you there,
but you paid for my new first floor.

444
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,840
Stossel is just baiting people.

445
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,960
Under no circumstances
does anyone want to be funding

446
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,040
the reconstruction of the world's
smuggest man's rickety sea prison.

447
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,080
There is lots to be confused about,
not the least of which that photo

448
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:39,520
of Stossel, posing shirtless,
in skin tight white swim trunks.

449
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,200
Who took that photo ? It can't
be another human who wanted it.

450
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,800
I think that he put a camera
on a long-delay timer,

451
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,800
then sprinted for a full 45 seconds
back to the deck of his house,

452
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:59,440
whispering "hurry" to himself
and got in position just in time.

453
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,720
That is the only scientifically
possible explanation.

454
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,640
We debated this and it's the only
scenario that we could all agree on.

455
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:15,480
Here's the thing: if you choose
to build something in a risky place,

456
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,320
like John Stossel's salt-battered,
bottoms-only beachmistake,

457
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,480
you should
be allowed to do that.

458
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,720
But you shouldn't expect the government
to repeatedly help you rebuild

459
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,720
when things inevitably go wrong.

460
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,280
The vast majority
here of NFIP beneficiaries

461
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,000
are not wealthy
or second homeowners.

462
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,040
They often need this program and
cannot afford for it to go under.

463
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,760
For those stuck
in repetitive loss properties,

464
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,360
it is easy for anyone to just say
they should just move,

465
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:52,280
but it's much more difficult,
as this Kentucky woman will tell you.

466
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,560
We couldn't sell our house.
Who would want to buy

467
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,800
a house that's had
this many repetitive floods in it ?

468
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,880
Neighbors have had their houses
up for sale for three years,

469
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,640
that haven't even had anyone
come and view the house.

470
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:15,560
We need a buyout from FEMA or
from whoever is responsible for this.

471
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,920
Her decision to try and leave that
home could not have been easy.

472
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,120
You don't want to throw out
the baby with the floodwater,

473
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,120
but the responsible thing to do
is to get a more water-resistant baby.

474
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,080
Also the title of Britain's bestselling
book on teaching children to swim.

475
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,880
Our buyout programs are underfunded
and prohibitively slow.

476
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,320
It can take years for buyouts
to get approved by which point,

477
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,320
homeowners have had
to rebuild their house,

478
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,560
and it may have
already flooded again.

479
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,000
A program that was supposed
to help people in flooded homes

480
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,160
is sometimes trapping them
inside them indefinitely.

481
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,880
Trapping people in structurally
unsound homes

482
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,800
isn't what the government is for:
it's what "Buying the Beach" is for.

483
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,840
There has to be a better way.
There are some key things

484
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,800
we can do to improve
this program.

485
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,880
We can meanstest it and get rid
of discounts for second homes

486
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,000
and gradually increase the insurance
rates so they reflect actual risk.

487
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,240
The last time that Congress tried
a major reform of the NFIP,

488
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:29,320
the result was that many people's
rates skyrocketed overnight.

489
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:35,000
Politicians were so spooked,
they scaled back many reforms.

490
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,200
I'm not saying that this
will ever be politically easy.

491
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:42,400
Even if you do properly fund
and streamline a buyout scheme,

492
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,320
there are still going to be cases
where people want to stay put.

493
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,400
In New York, there is a low-lying
community called Broad Channel

494
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,400
where the streets
can flood twice a month.

495
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,440
Its residents fought against
those rate increases a few years ago.

496
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,760
Many of them
have no interest in leaving.

497
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:05,400
The neighborhood is too great.
My house got destroyed by Sandy.

498
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,840
I redid my whole house.
People are like, you should move.

499
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,000
Absolutely not.

500
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,440
But you're standing
in water right now.

501
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,040
Maybe the people telling
you to move were saying:

502
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,440
"can you move up
five inches to dry land ?"

503
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,200
Even expensive interventions

504
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,320
are likely to only buy
that community a little more time

505
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,240
and people in Broad Channel
will be leaving,

506
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,800
whether it's by moving truck
or by boat.

507
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,720
Environmental conditions
are going to get worse.

508
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:46,720
Heavy downpours increased
and sea levels have been climbing.

509
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,720
I'm not saying that that is because
of climate change, even though...

510
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,200
It is ! It just fucking is !

511
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,880
It just is, precisely.

512
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:03,040
The NFIP is actually due for
reauthorization this December

513
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,160
and it's time to take another
shot at serious reform.

514
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,720
Without it, we have an unstable,
unsustainable program

515
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,560
that is indirectly harming
people it was designed to help.

516
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,640
I don't have any,
I told you last time that I haven't...

517
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,760
Relax.
I'm not here for Tostitos.

518
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,520
Really ?
Hold on. You can talk ?

519
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,200
Seagulls can talk. We just
choose to listen most of the time.

520
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,880
That's actually very nice.

521
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,440
I heard what you said about
flooding, and you are right.

522
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,080
I've seen it. I'm a seagull.

523
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,920
Some people in high-risk areas
will need to move.

524
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,800
We should give them the help
they can do that with.

525
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:47,440
While leaving your home is hard,
being forced out is ten times harder.

526
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,480
Your home
isn't just walls and a roof.

527
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,000
It's where the people you love are.

528
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,520
- That was absolutely beautiful.
- Not bad for a flying beach rat.

529
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:05,080
No. Don't talk like that
about yourself. No, don't.

530
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,200
I know it's true. You know it's true.
Everybody watching knows it's true.

531
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,720
I eat French fries
out of the garbage.

532
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,960
You're right.
You're absolutely disgusting.

533
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:19,320
I am sorry for misjudging
your motives in coming here.

534
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,120
That's okay, Johnny.
Just one more thing !

535
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,720
- Sure, anything.
- Do you have any Tostitos ?

536
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,360
Fuck you !
I do not have any Tostitos.

537
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,320
They're all gone !
Get the fuck out of here !

538
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,640
And now this !

539
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,040
A few of the things
Tucker Carlson is not against.

540
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,400
This is the way
America is heading.

541
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,640
I'm not against gays, I'm not
against people getting married.

542
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,480
Not against learning
about gay.

543
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,960
Not against transgenders
or gay cowboys !

544
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,160
Not against female firefighters
or federal employees.

545
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,760
I'm not against immigration !
I like immigrants.

546
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:01,040
I liked every Mexican I've met.
And I like the country.

547
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,280
Not against Sweden. I'm not
against people from Somalia.

548
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,920
I played squash
and I like the Canadians.

549
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,640
Canada is a sweet country,

550
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,840
like your retarded cousin
you pat him on the head.

551
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,480
I went to the Million Man March
and I had nothing against it.

552
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,560
I'm not against art.
I'm not attacking Oprah.

553
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,680
I'm not against George Clooney.
I like Morgan Freeman.

554
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,760
I have nothing against Jane Fonda.
I'm not against Matthew McConaugh.

555
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:34,960
I don't even understand
but I'm against it. But I like it.

556
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,800
That's our show.
See you next week, good night !

557
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:47,280
I have a Tostito. Ok ?
There you go. That's it.

558
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,880
I've got another Tostito.
Take it easy.

559
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,720
Look just peck it.

560
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,280
Just have the bag.
Shit !

561
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,160
