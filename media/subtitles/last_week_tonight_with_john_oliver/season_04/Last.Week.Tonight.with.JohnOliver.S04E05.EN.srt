LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,840
SEASON IV
EPISODE 405

3
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,520
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,200
Thank you for joining us.
A quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,960
On Wednesday, it was
International Women's Day,

6
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,760
or as I call it,
Int-Her-National Women's Day.

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,720
Hashtag feminism,
hashtag hashtag feminism.

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,120
The best way of gauging
not just how far women have come,

9
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,080
but how far
they still have to go,

10
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,600
is by watching powerful men
around the world

11
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,120
trip over their dicks
talking about the day.

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,320
Let's start with Vladimir Putin.

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,520
Women give us life and
perpetuate it in our children.

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,600
We will do our utmost to surround
our dear women with care and attention

15
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,040
so that they can smile more often.

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,200
Perfect. If there are
two things that women love,

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,480
it's being told to smile more
and being surrounded.

18
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,720
Come on, baby. You're such
pretty gender when you smile.

19
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,000
Give Vladimir a little twirl.

20
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,080
Putin is a model of sensitivity

21
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,600
next to the speech given
by Brazilian president Michel Temer.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,120
Today women participate
strongly in the economy too.

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,520
Nobody is more capable of pointing
out changes in supermarket prices

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,720
better than women.

25
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,880
He reduced the economic contribution
of half of Brazil's population to:

26
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,680
"women be shoppin', y'all."

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,480
This year, there was no more
spectacular celebration

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,200
than in San Antonio, Texas,

29
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,760
where one local morning show
host really gave it his all.

30
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,200
Today is International Women's Day
so ladies, don't worry, it's your day.

31
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,040
You can do whatever you want.
It's workout Wednesday.

32
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,000
It's time to get that bikini body
in time for summer.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,280
Ladies, you can do whatever
you want, crunches, curls,

34
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,320
maybe some light cardio,
point is, keep it tight.

35
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,640
It's your day. But keep it tight.
He was just getting started.

36
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,160
It's just me today,
Kimberly's in traffic but it's ok,

37
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,480
it's Women's Day
so she can do that today.

38
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,640
This year Women's Day will come
together with "A Day Without",

39
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,080
women being on strike.

40
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,280
When it comes down to it,
that's where we all come from.

41
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,000
What ? That is a pretty limited
understanding of human reproduction.

42
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,800
I bet if you asked him to label
a chart of the female anatomy,

43
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,040
he'd write "noice" across
the top of it and call it a day.

44
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,440
He went on and on.
He attempted to ad-lib his way

45
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,000
through a whole story
in a manner so incompetent,

46
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,000
it made you feel
the stuck-in-traffic Kimberly

47
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,240
probably does most
of the heavy lifting on that show.

48
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,360
In that sense, I'm not sure
that anyone this week

49
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,000
managed to show better what
a day without women is all about.

50
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,800
Kimberly, I don't know
who you are or what you do,

51
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,280
but I sure as shit know what
happens when you're not there.

52
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,960
Tomorrow, go into the office
and ask for a fucking raise.

53
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:36,480
So, for now, let's move on
to the CIA. My employer...

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,000
I wasn't supposed to say that !
They're gonna be so mad with me.

55
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,040
The CIA had a difficult week.

56
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,920
WikiLeaks has a bombshell,
publishing these documents.

57
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,120
What could be the biggest exposure
of US intelligence gathering methods

58
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,680
since Snowden's leak.

59
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,280
The spy agency
has become the spied upon !

60
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,880
There is a certain satisfaction
in seeing that.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,480
It's akin to going and shitting
on the neighborhood dog's lawn.

62
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,360
How do you fucking like it ?
How do you like it now ?

63
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,280
The documents initially
sounded pretty alarming.

64
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,600
According to WikiLeaks,
the CIA explored the possibility

65
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,160
of hacking
into the software of modern cars.

66
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,320
It can be accessed from outside
and taken control of

67
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,800
and this can let you do from
playing the music to taking control

68
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,280
and crashing it if you want
to assassinate somebody.

69
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,760
That escalated quickly.

70
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,520
First I'll make them listen
to Coldplay and then it's murder !

71
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,280
Listen again to how that report
characterized this news.

72
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,200
According to WikiLeaks,
the CIA explored the possibility

73
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,800
of hacking
into the software of modern cars.

74
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,760
They "explored the possibility" of it.
And that is important.

75
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,800
We knew that cars could,
technically, be hacked.

76
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,200
So it's not surprising the CIA might
be interested in doing that, too.

77
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,200
But "exploring the possibility
of doing something"

78
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,000
isn't the same as doing it.

79
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,080
A list of things I've thought about
doing but have not done includes:

80
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,640
karate, chess, guitar,
becoming a "wine guy",

81
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,840
CrossFit, going vegan,
learning Spanish, alpaca farming,

82
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,840
and being a guy with a woodshop
making the perfect birdhouse.

83
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,760
This story ate up a lot of media time.

84
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,320
Allegations were slightly less
alarming than early coverage suggested.

85
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,480
Take another one
of the big claims.

86
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,400
A program called Weeping Angel,
which can remotely turn

87
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,440
a Samsung TV anywhere in the world
into a secret listening device.

88
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,640
One CIA hacking operation
called Weeping Angel.

89
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,120
If you've got a Samsung TV,
you think you're watching TV ?

90
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,960
That thing is watching you.

91
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,920
Okay, first: she should
deliver all of the news.

92
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,680
"19 dead in a blazing apartment fire,
all of them children, girlfriend."

93
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,360
"Weeping Angel" sounds
less like a spy program

94
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,080
and more like a tactic your mom
uses to keep you from masturbating.

95
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,240
Look at the Weeping Angel, David.
You did that ! You made her cry !

96
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,960
The notion that the CIA can listen
to anyone through their TV is scary.

97
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,840
If you read the documents,
you'll find this program applies

98
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,640
to Samsung TVs
from 2012 and 2013,

99
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,200
and the malware
was installed via USB,

100
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,720
so the CIA needed to physically
stick that into your TV.

101
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,360
Experts advise that there's still
a potential way to circumvent it.

102
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,080
It's a little complicated.
Step one: unplug the TV.

103
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,480
And that is it. End of steps.
You're off the grid.

104
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,400
But what is most important
regarding these revelations

105
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,800
is CIA, with some exceptions,
is barred from spying domestically.

106
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,240
There is nothing in these documents
showing illegal surveillance.

107
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,600
Which is not to say there wasn't
interesting stuff in there.

108
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,720
Weeping Angel was the beginning
of the CIA's stupid code names.

109
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,240
A range of CIA programs
with code names like After Midnight

110
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,800
and Brutal Kangaroo all in the hands
of terrorists and foreign targets.

111
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,920
It's not just After Midnight
and Brutal Kangaroo.

112
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,680
Other programs were called
Crunchy Lime Skies, Elder Piggy,

113
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,560
AngerQuake and McNugget.

114
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,400
Which are also the names of
a'cappella groups at Dartmouth.

115
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,760
You should hear Crunchy Lime Skies'
rendition of "Roar." It is fierce !

116
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,360
I am not saying these leaks
are not a big deal.

117
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,240
The fact that WikiLeaks obtained
these documents is significant.

118
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,560
This story is still developing.
There's only one thing we can say

119
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,960
and that is that the big loser so far
is Samsung.

120
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,960
They have had
a rough couple of months.

121
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,760
Remember what happened
with their phones.

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,280
Burning and melting. Samsung
issuing an unprecedented recall

123
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,320
of millions of new Galaxy Note 7
smart phones.

124
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,960
Wanted to post this and share
what happened to my Note 7.

125
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,280
Everyone rocking the new Note 7,
might catch fire.

126
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,800
Not ideal. That is the worst thing
that can happen with a phone

127
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,080
other than someone leaving a voicemail
instead of text like a normal person.

128
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,440
It is not just Samsung's phones.

129
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,000
Washing machines, exploding.

130
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,680
I'm totally scared.

131
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,360
Lids flying off. Samsung launching
a nationwide recall in November.

132
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,400
I'm afraid to do laundry,
it could hurt my kids.

133
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,680
"I'm afraid to do laundry" is not
a great review of a washing machine.

134
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,760
It is a fantastic review
of "Jaws 5: Laundry Shark".

135
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,040
Samsung is having
a spectacularly bad run of PR,

136
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,120
they should come clean about
all their other products' flaws.

137
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,000
Hi, we're Samsung,
and we understand

138
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,600
you might be a little nervous around
our products at the moment,

139
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,440
and we just want you to know,
we totally get it.

140
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,280
Our promise is no more surprises !
Cards on the table, here's the truth.

141
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,320
Our phones secretly call your mom
whenever you're having sex.

142
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,040
Our laptop computers scream
in pain any time you touch them.

143
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,680
Our robot vacuums will fuck your cat.
And your cat is gonna like it.

144
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,800
Here's a fun fact:
our Smart TVs firmly believe

145
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,040
that Bill Cosby is innocent.

146
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,760
No shit. Our fitness watch
is actually fine,

147
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,560
but it does make you
look like a total douche.

148
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,880
And finally,
our dryers make things wetter.

149
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,400
We know.

150
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,120
But the one promise we can
absolutely make you

151
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,240
is that none of our products
will explode anymore.

152
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,200
Shit ! Okay.
Maybe the phones, I guess.

153
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,760
But definitely not the...
Shit. No.

154
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,760
Put the vacuum up.
Oh my God, it's on fire.

155
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,720
The vacuum's on fire.
How is it still moving ?

156
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,120
Fuck !

157
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,520
Tell me the watch is okay. You
fucking tell me that watch is okay.

158
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,000
No ! Oh, God, fuck me.

159
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,640
The point is, our dryers,
they are fine.

160
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,240
Fuck you.

161
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,560
Samsung. At least our logo
works, right ? Come on !

162
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,600
Moving on. For our main story,
we're going to look at Obamacare.

163
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,520
The opposite of this photo, which
is more "Obama-Don't-Give-A-Fuck".

164
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,400
We devoted 20 minutes
to Republicans' efforts

165
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,360
to repeal and replace that bill.

166
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,080
The reason we have to talk
about it again is this.

167
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,160
Republicans reveal their long-awaited
replacement for Obamacare.

168
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,120
House Republicans roll out
a health care plan.

169
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,680
The Republican plan
to replace Obamacare is public.

170
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,680
This is
the American Health Care Act.

171
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,040
Yes, it's finally here !
The American Health Care Act:

172
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,200
you may not have wanted it,
but it's here anyway.

173
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,200
It's the legislative equivalent of
"Pirates Of The Caribbean Five:"

174
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,040
"The Curse of Johnny Depp Getting
Divorced and Needing the Money".

175
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,440
As will be the case with that movie,
the early reviews have been rough.

176
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,240
This is dead on arrival.

177
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,160
Conservatives hate their bill.
Obamacare lite, dead on arrival.

178
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,320
It seems dead on arrival.

179
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,040
They're calling it garbage.
They're calling it dead on arrival.

180
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,600
Yes, much like the life
behind Melania Trump's eyes,

181
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,880
the AHCA looked dead by the time
it was introduced in Washington.

182
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,080
The bill got enemies quickly.
American Medical Association,

183
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,680
American Hospital Association,
American Nurses Association

184
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,200
and the AARP
all came out against it.

185
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,600
Even people you would presume
would be happy about the repeal

186
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,240
were not exactly thrilled.

187
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,440
Let me show you what was
the front page of Breitbart.

188
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,720
Freedomworks Opposes Speaker
Ryan's Obamacare 2.0 Plan.

189
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,320
I don't think
they meant that in a nice way.

190
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,880
I don't think they do either.
They mean it in the sense of:

191
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,560
"Ryan is a beta-male who needs
safe space for his cuckservative bill".

192
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,680
People on both sides see the
AHCA as being shitty Obamacare.

193
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,200
The way Old Navy is a shitty
version of the Gap,

194
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,680
and the way Easter should
just be called Shitty Christmas.

195
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,480
Only one month 'till Shitty Christmas !
What are you asking for ?

196
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,160
It had better be a basket of beans,
that's what you're getting !

197
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,240
This bill is not actually
dead on arrival.

198
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,720
There is still a chance
it could become law.

199
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,880
We need to take a look
at what is inside this thing.

200
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,400
Let's start with one
of the big changes.

201
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,080
It gets rid of Obamacare's
insurance tax credits,

202
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,640
based on many factors,
including income,

203
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:38,160
and they've replaced that
with a flat tax credit based on age.

204
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,600
The proposal provides tax credits
to help pay for premiums.

205
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,400
Someone under the age of 30
would get $2 000.

206
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,800
Someone 60 and older
would get $4 000.

207
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,480
Okay. So, the older you get
the more money you get.

208
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,640
Think of it as the exact opposite
of being a woman in Hollywood.

209
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,320
As we discussed two weeks ago,
the key question here is,

210
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,200
do the size of those credits cover
the cost of health insurance,

211
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,360
or are you left, like a middle-aged
man in a thong, under-covered ?

212
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,600
I'm sorry: can, can we just take
that down ? That's much better.

213
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:21,120
The Kaiser Family Foundation
made a tool showing you

214
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,560
how you might be impacted
by this new bill,

215
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,880
based on your age,
income and location.

216
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,720
It's like a choose-your-own game
for a very specific type of child.

217
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,840
If your kid likes Caillou,
he will love this interactive map

218
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,760
of tax credits from
the Kaiser Family Foundation.

219
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,680
Let's say you live in Woodward
County, Oklahoma, you're 60,

220
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,480
and you earn $50 000 a year,
under Obamacare,

221
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,280
you'd get $13 350 towards
insurance.

222
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,520
But under the new bill,
that will drop down to $4 000.

223
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,760
That is over two-thirds less !

224
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,560
It's not one of those two-thirds
decreases you barely notice,

225
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,160
like when Robin and Barry
of The Bee Gees died.

226
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,040
I'm kidding. Barry is fine,
Robin and Maurice are dead.

227
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,800
Or are they ?
The point is: they are.

228
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,280
I have no idea, you either, and I don't
see either one of us Googling it soon.

229
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,520
That is one example.
There are a lot of people

230
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,200
who would be harmed by
the switch to these flat tax credits

231
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,840
and experts say one thing
is pretty clear here:

232
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,240
those who are lower-income
would be particularly hurt.

233
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,840
That is before we even get
into Medicaid,

234
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,880
the program that provides health care
to poor and disabled Americans.

235
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,720
That is where this bill
gets really vicious.

236
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,440
You know the changes are rough

237
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,440
from how creepily enthusiastic
Paul Ryan sounds talking about them.

238
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,840
Let me describe what this bill
does for conservatives.

239
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,080
This is why I think people need to see
the forest through the trees.

240
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,520
We are defederalizing
an entitlement,

241
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,120
block granting it back to the states
and capping its growth rate.

242
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,480
That's never been done before.

243
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,080
He is rock hard
talking about that.

244
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,920
Somehow, you can hear
his erection during that.

245
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,720
If you don't know, that sounds
like a benign pile of words.

246
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,400
But when he says "defederalizing,
block granting and capping",

247
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,400
what that means in layman's terms
is cutting the shit out of Medicaid.

248
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:31,600
The plan would cut at least 370
billion in federal funding for Medicaid

249
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,320
over the next ten years.

250
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,880
States would have to make up that
gap to maintain current coverage.

251
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,720
Which for many of them
will be next to impossible.

252
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,040
So when they don't,

253
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,120
millions of the poorest Americans
will lose coverage, millions.

254
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,520
And I heard Ryan getting
another erection

255
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,240
when I said those words.

256
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,440
And when you combine that with
the insufficient tax credits,

257
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,960
6 to 15 million people
are projected to lose insurance.

258
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,000
To hear Jason Chaffetz tell it,
there is an easy solution.

259
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,840
Americans have choices and
they've got to make a choice.

260
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,600
And so maybe rather than
getting that new iPhone

261
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,320
maybe they should
invest in their own healthcare.

262
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,560
That is complete bullshit.

263
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,800
It's hard to take a lecture
on making good choices

264
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,640
from a man who entered
a barbershop and said:

265
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:30,160
"Give me the wet poodle pubes.
Make it look like this photo I took."

266
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,720
If insurance cost as an iPhone,
we wouldn't be having this debate.

267
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,120
People are going to be hurt
by this bill

268
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,880
and those hit the hardest
who stand to lose $5 000 or more

269
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,640
under the new plan are, a group
that voted for Trump by a huge margin.

270
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,680
Which is pretty frustrating.

271
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,200
It's like if the people of Pompeii
voted for the volcano.

272
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,760
I know you get to define
your own self-interest,

273
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,760
but I wish you hadn't voted
for that volcano.

274
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,080
If this bill is bad for older
Americans, poor Americans

275
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,400
and many Trump supporters
and all these groups oppose it,

276
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,480
who exactly is it for ?

277
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,160
Wealthy Americans are set
to get a sizable tax break

278
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,120
under the GOP's healthcare bill.

279
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,880
And the ultra wealthy will see
an even bigger tax cut.

280
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,840
Those in the top 1% of incomes
will get a tax break of around $33 000.

281
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,520
Those in the top 0.1% will get
an average tax cut

282
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,240
of about $197 000
under the GOP plan.

283
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,600
Indeed. So this plan is literally
taking money from the poor

284
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,560
and giving it to the very rich.

285
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,840
It's a reverse Bernie Sanders,
which is actually also the name

286
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,920
of a sex act consisting
of very aggressive fingering.

287
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,040
It is not just liberals
uncomfortable with this idea.

288
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,160
Paul Ryan visited "Tucker Carlson's
second second-chance attempt"

289
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,720
"at his own TV news show
with Tucker Carlson"

290
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,760
and found himself under attack.

291
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,200
Kind of a hard sell to say:
"we're gonna repeal Obamacare"

292
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,880
"but we'll send more money to those
who've gotten the richest."

293
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,680
I'm not a leftist. That's true !

294
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,600
I'm not a leftist, that's true.
Ryan's plan is so harsh,

295
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,080
it just caused a 47-year-old boy-man
in a bowtie named "Tucker"

296
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,840
to worry about seeming overly
sympathetic to the poor.

297
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,440
Before you point out that
Carlson isn't wearing a bowtie...

298
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,040
He is.
Just not where you can see it.

299
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,440
Many Republican governors
and members of Congress

300
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,200
expressed concern that this bill
is going to hurt their states.

301
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,440
Those on the far right wing
of the party,

302
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,320
like Congressman Mo Brooks,
think it's way too generous.

303
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,120
This far and away is the biggest
welfare program ever sponsored,

304
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,040
it increases greater reliance on
welfare from the government.

305
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,000
It's gonna to result in the demise
of our country or at least contribute

306
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,360
to our debilitating insolvency.

307
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,200
So this bill seems almost
universally hated in Washington.

308
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,640
It is truly the Ted Cruz
of healthcare legislation.

309
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,440
Fuck you, Ted.
Fuck you, from everybody.

310
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,800
The White House clearly
has a tough sales job ahead,

311
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,480
their efforts
have been less than impressive.

312
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:41,880
Watch White House Press Secretary,
Melissa McCarthy, deploy visual aids.

313
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,840
For all the people who have
concerns about this, look at the size.

314
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,320
This is the Democrats,
this is us.

315
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,320
You can't get any clearer in terms
of "this is government", "this is not".

316
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,480
First: she's a national treasure.

317
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,120
That is the most aggressively
stupid thing I've ever seen.

318
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,960
I saw Jason Chaffetz suggest
paying for health insurance

319
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,440
by retroactively not buying
an iPhone.

320
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,240
That low page count starts
to get worrisome when you find out

321
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,040
what they spend time
in there focusing on.

322
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,520
A section devoted to making sure
people receiving health care assistance

323
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,800
who win the lottery are removed
from the program.

324
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,800
Six pages of this bill is devoted

325
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,240
to letting states dis-enroll
high dollar lottery winners.

326
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,360
So a not-insignificant percentage
of this bill is focused on:

327
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,680
"what if one poor person
suddenly becomes less poor ?"

328
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,560
I'm surprised they didn't
have a section for

329
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,240
what would happen in the event
of a Freaky Friday-type situation.

330
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,680
If a recipient Freaky-Fridays into
the body of an individual

331
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,720
living above 138 percent
of the federal poverty line,

332
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:02,120
states are obligated to de-enroll
recipient until Freaky-Fridays back,

333
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,560
using wish or magic
not otherwise specified

334
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,200
or Freaky-Fridays
into an eligible body.

335
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,640
And yet, despite all of this,

336
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,440
Republican leaders are
trying to jam this bill through.

337
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,560
It had been introduced in the house
and passed by two committees.

338
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,600
And yet there is one person,
you noticed I haven't mentioned so far:

339
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,280
and that is Donald Trump.

340
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,760
He's been
largely absent from our story,

341
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,840
because he's been absent
from this story in general.

342
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,680
Putting aside the prop comedy
of the star of "Mike and Molly",

343
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,760
the White House has been
pretty hands-off with this bill.

344
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,520
And is there really any way,
deep down,

345
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,200
that Trump has read this thing,
given that he recently said this ?

346
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:55,400
We have come up with a solution
that's really very good.

347
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,000
I have to tell you:
it's an unbelievably complex subject.

348
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,880
Nobody knew health care
could be so complicated.

349
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,880
Everybody knew
health care is complicated.

350
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,840
Literally everybody. It is the one
thing people know about health care.

351
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,800
It's complicated.
It's like you're saying:

352
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,960
"Who knew King Tut was dead ?"
Everybody did.

353
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,400
He's as dead as Barry,
Maurice or Robin Gibb.

354
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,040
Or all of them, or none of them.
There's no way to find out.

355
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,160
Trump has been distant
from this whole process

356
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,880
and nothing shows that more
than how this bill is being branded.

357
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,240
Is it by any other name,
Trumpcare ?

358
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,000
I'll call it Trumpcare if you want to,

359
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,040
but I didn't hear President Trump
say I want my name on that.

360
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,680
Holy shit. Trump is not clamoring
to put his name on this bill

361
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:55,200
and he has put his name on some
of the shittiest products in history.

362
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,840
He put his name on a vodka,
even though he doesn't drink,

363
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,600
whose slogan was "success
distilled", which was discontinued.

364
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,400
He put his name on Trump ties,
which look like the answer to:

365
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,040
"if erectile dysfunction was a fabric,
what fabric would it be ?"

366
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,480
He even slapped his first and
last names on Donald Trump Jr.,

367
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,680
a man who looks like a six-year-old's
drawing of a mean bank teller.

368
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,800
Trump not wanting his name
on the health care bill

369
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,880
is like Tyler Perry not wanting
his name anywhere near

370
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,600
"Jew!: A Madea Hannukah."

371
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:35,000
I can kind of understand Trump
not wanting his name on this.

372
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,280
It contains nothing
that he promised,

373
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,040
as Laura Ingraham pointed out
on Fox and Friends.

374
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,120
The Trumpism of the healthcare
reform, the Trumpiest parts of it,

375
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,960
were transparency in pricing,
competition across state lines

376
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,760
and even on the edges, repealing
the McCarran-Ferguson Act.

377
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,480
Where is that in this plan ?

378
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,680
I'll tell you, it's not in there.
He is pushing a health-care bill

379
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,280
that is missing a lot
of what he said he wanted.

380
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,760
That is the top-shelf dealmaking
that you can read all about

381
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,720
in his bestselling book:
"The art of the... wait !"

382
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,280
"What was the deal I wanted
again ? I forget."

383
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,080
"Let's talk about how hot
my daughter is, right, fellas ?"

384
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:22,440
Trump noticed that criticism.
Shortly after the segment aired,

385
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,640
he tweeted, don't worry,
getting rid of state lines,

386
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,440
which will promote competition,
will be in phase 2 & 3 of rollout.

387
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:35,120
As if to eliminate any doubt as to
he was watching Fox and Friends

388
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,600
he ended the tweet:
@foxandfriends.

389
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,560
Just about that
"buying across state lines" business:

390
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,160
Trump and Ryan keep promising
that it's just around the corner.

391
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,080
It probably won't lower prices.
These three states currently allow it,

392
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,400
but not a single out-of-state-insurer
has taken them up on the offer,

393
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,880
which make sense.

394
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,040
If you're an insurer in Massachusetts,
it takes a massive amount of time

395
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,400
and investment to set up new networks
of doctors and hospitals in Maine.

396
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,800
Assuming Maine even has
doctors,

397
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,520
I think it's mainly beavers
with stethoscopes.

398
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,280
This state line thing is something
people love to talk about in theory

399
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,400
but no one wants
to do in practice,

400
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,280
like apple picking
or shower sex.

401
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:27,400
The bigger issue is, it's almost
certainly not going to happen.

402
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,440
The state-lines bullshit and a lot
of other things Trump promised

403
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,680
are not in this bill because they
cannot be, as Ryan well knows.

404
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,640
Inter-state shopping across
state lines. We love that policy,

405
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,320
but you cannot put that
in a budget reconciliation bill,

406
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,080
it could be filibustered.

407
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:51,920
Exactly. For procedural reasons,
this is presented as a budget bill.

408
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,240
Which Republicans can pass
with a simple senate majority.

409
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,880
Any non-budget-related policy change
requires 60 votes to beat a filibuster.

410
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,720
That is pretty much a dead-end.
Meaning that this bill is

411
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,720
all Trump can get passed
to replace Obamacare.

412
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,040
So it is important everyone
understands what is in it,

413
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,080
and that the "something terrific"
that he promised,

414
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,000
better coverage, lower costs, no
one losing their health insurance.

415
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,560
This bill is not it.

416
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,520
The bill Trump is championing will
increase costs for poorer Americans

417
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,640
and will cause millions
to lose coverage.

418
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,160
Somebody needs
to explain this to him.

419
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,360
Since he is clearly still
watching Fox and Friends,

420
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,840
we might actually be able
to help here.

421
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,760
You might remember last month,
we bought time on that show

422
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,840
to have our Catheter Cowboy explain
what the nuclear triad is.

423
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,200
Saddle up, partner,
for tonight, you ride again !

424
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,680
Who better to tell Trump
what this bill will do

425
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,240
than someone
who's stands to be hurt by it ?

426
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,200
Someone in his sixties,
in rural America,

427
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,480
with an unspecified medical problem
that requires constant treatment ?

428
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:12,960
Please enjoy this ad, which will air
on Fox and Friends in the D.C. area.

429
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,640
Attention patients.

430
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,680
Hi, me again. I'm a professional
cowboy and I use catheters.

431
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,080
Been cowboyin' for 25 years and
there's two things I know:

432
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,720
I don't like paying when I cath
and healthcare is complicated.

433
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,560
Everybody knows that,
literally, everybody.

434
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,920
Also if my premiums go up
and subsidies go down,

435
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,440
I'm gonna wind up paying more,
basic math there.

436
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,800
That's like replacing my catheter
with a garden hose.

437
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,520
I do not like pain when I cath.

438
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,480
If that happens, millions of folks
like me might get real angry,

439
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,160
which is worth thinking about
if you like being popular.

440
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,080
You get that, right ? Right ?

441
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,120
You get that ?

442
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,000
Right ?

443
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,920
Right ?

444
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,120
You get that, right ?

445
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,480
That's our show !
See you next week. Goodnight !

446
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,560
How is that moving ?
Why is it not dead ? It's on fire !

447
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,720
That's fucked up right there.
Is it me ? Or is that fucked up ?

448
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,840
Shit. Fuck this whole thing.
We are grossly irresponsible.

449
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,280
It's coming right at me.
Fuck this.

450
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,920
I can't even believe I agreed
to do this. You guys suck.

451
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,560
END OF EPISODE 5,
SEASON IV
