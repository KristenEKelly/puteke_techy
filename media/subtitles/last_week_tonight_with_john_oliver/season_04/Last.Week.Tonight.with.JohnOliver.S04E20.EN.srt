00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,080
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,720
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to Last Week Tonight.

3
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,480
I am John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

4
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,840
And much like the disintegration
of western civilization,

5
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,200
we begin tonight,
with Donald Trump.

6
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,440
The Donald Trump Jr.
of American presidents.

7
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,520
And now, if around 5pm on Friday,

8
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,120
you suddenly started feeling
just a little bit calmer,

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,200
it may be because this happened.

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,280
Tonight, President Donald Trump is
getting away from the Washington heat.

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,120
The president arrived in New Jersey
just a little while ago

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,720
to begin a 17-day vacation.

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,760
Yes, Trump is taking
a 17-day vacation from work,

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,920
which means America may be getting
a 17-day vacation from Trump.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,720
Which is exciting, right ?

16
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,880
Although, hold on,
while he's there,

17
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,080
he will still have access
to the nuclear codes,

18
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:24,080
and, even worse, Wi-Fi,
so don't relax. Never relax.

19
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,760
Your life is still a torture chamber
of fear and panic.

20
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,680
But that was on Friday,
and Trump was leaving

21
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,960
at the end of what the White House
had dubbed "American Dream Week."

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,840
Which Trump chose to mark by
demeaning as many American institutions

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,640
as he possibly could,
beginning with this.

24
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,480
After that political speech
to the Boy Scouts last week,

25
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,120
the president told
The Wall Street Journal

26
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,800
the head of the Boy Scouts
personally called him

27
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,320
to say it was the greatest speech
that was ever made to them

28
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,040
and they were very thankful.

29
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,640
But actually
the speech angered so many,

30
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,520
the Boy Scouts were forced
to issue an apology.

31
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,760
And yesterday
they said there was no phone call.

32
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,120
Okay, so let me get this straight:

33
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,920
Trump showed up,
said a bunch of crazy shit,

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,800
then lied to make himself
look good.

35
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,080
I'm honestly not sure
why the Boy Scouts are so upset.

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,760
If you book Trump, you get Trump.

37
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,080
You can't book Gallagher

38
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,640
and then complain when you go home
covered in melon juice.

39
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,600
If you're not familiar with his acts
by now, it's kind of on you.

40
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,200
But Trump was just getting started.

41
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,480
Even as that controversy
was still going, a new one emerged.

42
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,280
According to Sports
Illustrated's Golf.com,

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,400
President Trump explained
to members of one of his golf clubs

44
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,400
that he goes to his own properties
so frequently these days

45
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,920
because, quote,
"that White House is a real dump."

46
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,560
Now, yes, it seems a little odd

47
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,320
to call an objectively
grand residence "a dump",

48
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,520
until you remember
that Trump's taste in interior design

49
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,240
is a cross between C-3PO's colon

50
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,800
and a museum where no one
has ever learned anything.

51
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,520
Trump issued a statement
denying that he had said that,

52
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,200
tweeting, "I love the White House,
one of the most beautiful buildings"

53
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,240
"(homes) I have ever seen."

54
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,200
And that is two qualifiers !
In one sentence !

55
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,560
It's the equivalent of saying,

56
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,560
"I love my wife.
She is one of the most beautiful women"

57
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,920
"(older than 30)
I have ever seen."

58
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,760
But the journalist who wrote that
story stood by it,

59
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,080
stating that "Trump said this
in front of eight or nine people".

60
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,680
Which is actually a pretty brilliant
way to get Trump to confirm it:

61
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,040
estimate the size of his crowd
and just wait for him to correct you.

62
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,720
"I didn't call the White House a dump
in front of eight or nine people,"

63
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,120
"I said it in front of hundreds
of thousands of people,"

64
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,720
"and all of them were 10's,
and all of them loved it,"

65
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,760
"and the next day everyone called me
and told me"

66
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,960
"that no one had ever done a better job
of calling the White House a dump."

67
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,080
"Nobody had done it !
I'm sad inside."

68
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,320
And look, Trump still wasn't done,
because on Thursday,

69
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,800
it emerged, that in a conversation
with Mexico's president,

70
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,720
he had shit talked
an entire American state.

71
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,600
While talking about stopping the flow
of drugs into the United States

72
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,440
the president also said this,
and I'm quoting him,

73
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,640
"I won New Hampshire because
New Hampshire is a drug-infested den."

74
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay, so first, obviously, he is wrong
about winning New Hampshire.

75
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,280
He lost it in the general.

76
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,400
But second, I am not going to sit here
and defend the state of New Hampshire.

77
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,920
I haven't lost some terrible dare.

78
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,120
But that is not the way,

79
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,520
even if you want to do it,
to shit on New Hampshire.

80
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,080
If you want to do that, just point out

81
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,800
it's nothing more than 9,000 square
miles of granite and Lyme disease,

82
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,720
and it is the only state so boring,

83
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,080
it can genuinely make you say,
"oh thank God, we're in Maine now."

84
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't want to give you
the impression

85
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,760
that it was only Trump
in the White House

86
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,840
attacking cornerstones
of America this week.

87
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,680
Because it was also Stephen Miller,

88
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,720
policy adviser
and vitamin-D deficient Minion.

89
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,240
Yes, you might well think,
"that's unfair."

90
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,440
"Anyone can find a photo of someone
looking a bit like a Minion."

91
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,360
But with Miller, it is genuinely hard

92
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,080
to find a photo of him not looking
like a Minion. I'll show you.

93
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,440
Frowny Minion, smoochy Minion,
smiley Minion !

94
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,640
Look ! They're both happy
because they're planning something !

95
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,760
Now, in any case,
Miller spoke to the press this week

96
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,480
about the White House's support
for a draconian immigration bill,

97
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,440
which would slash legal immigration
levels in half over a decade,

98
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,880
and make citizenship
contingent on factors such as

99
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,560
English ability,
education levels, and job skills.

100
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,240
Which prompted this incredible
exchange with CNN's Jim Acosta.

101
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,360
The Statue of Liberty says,
'give me your tired, your poor,'

102
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,000
'your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free.'

103
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,000
It doesn't say anything
about speaking English

104
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,480
or being able to be
a computer programmer.

105
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,240
The poem that you're referring to,
that was added later,

106
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,840
it's not actually a part
of the original Statue of Liberty.

107
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,040
Wait, though. Just because
it wasn't part of the original,

108
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,800
does not mean
it is worthless.

109
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,920
Some of the best things ever made
were changed partway through.

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,360
Did you know for instance
there was a time

111
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,920
where Fast and Furious movies
didn't have The Rock in them ?

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,680
It's true ! And they sucked ! That's
why they added The Fucking Rock !

113
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:20,200
That clearly wasn't the greatest piece
of communication from Stephen Miller,

114
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,320
so the White House is now
considering him

115
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,920
for the communications
director job,

116
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,920
taking over
from the dearly departed "Mooch".

117
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,080
And that would be a lot
of responsibility for Stephen Miller,

118
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,960
a man who is, and this may be the
most shocking thing you learn tonight,

119
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,960
31 years old.

120
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,680
He is 31 human years old.

121
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,040
He is the same age as the Olsen twin.

122
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,560
That's right. I said twin.
There's only one of them in that photo,

123
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,160
she's tricking your eyes
by moving very quickly.

124
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,920
How is she doing that
in a still photograph ?

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,280
I don't know that yet, but I'm close.
I'm really close.

126
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,960
The point is, Miller is so young
that there are

127
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,520
videos on the internet
of what he was like in high school

128
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,280
and first of all, obviously:
Minion.

129
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,600
But second: the video was of him
campaigning for student government,

130
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,320
and it gives you a sense
of what we may all be in for

131
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,360
if he does become
the new Mooch.

132
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,120
Am I the only one who is sick and tired
of being told to pick up my trash

133
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,840
when we have plenty of janitors
who are paid to do it for us ?

134
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,400
Wow.

135
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:38,360
He is truly one of the most revolting
humans (Minions) I have ever seen.

136
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,520
In a way there is no more fitting
spokesman for the Trump administration

137
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,680
than an entitled, elitist asshole

138
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,400
who refuses to take responsibility
for the messes he makes,

139
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,240
and who can somehow manage
to pick a fight with a fucking statue.

140
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,800
And now, this.

141
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,520
And now, you wish you loved anything

142
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,760
as much as Seattle gardening expert
Ciscoe Morris loves everything.

143
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,000
It's time to clean out the garden.
There's room for new plants out there !

144
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,640
This is the best tomato on Earth.

145
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,240
Oh, I love that plant.

146
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,640
I love this nursery.
Great plants.

147
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,680
This is a really cool plant.

148
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,280
This is the ugliest plant in the world,
but I love it.

149
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,040
I love chimes.

150
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,120
I've used one of these for a banister
on my porch.

151
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,320
Oh, Meeghan, I'm so excited.
Look, the rhubarb is starting to bud !

152
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,640
It's so cute.
Rhubarb tart !

153
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,160
I just saw rhubarb budding up
in my garden,

154
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,280
and I love the living dweedle
out of that stuff.

155
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,400
I'm gonna harvest the living beetle
hopper outta you !

156
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,920
So pretty.
Does smell good.

157
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,440
So flavorful !

158
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,880
I love doing this !
Can I do this for the next half hour ?

159
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,960
Look at that one !

160
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,880
AND NOW

161
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,080
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns the border,

162
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,720
the boundary that is incredibly tough
to smuggle a monkey across, I am told.

163
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,400
President Trump has famously made

164
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,080
securing the border
a key priority for his administration,

165
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,120
most notably through his border wall,

166
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,080
something which,
as we've pointed out before,

167
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,640
he himself inadvertently found
a flaw in on the campaign trail.

168
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,680
There's no ladder going over that.

169
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,640
If they ever get up there,
they're in trouble,

170
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,880
because there's no way
to get down. Maybe a rope.

171
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,680
Yeah, yeah, maybe a rope.

172
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,280
I know that sounds stupid,
but to be fair,

173
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,560
you haven't heard phase six
of Trump's border security plan:

174
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,000
go get me all the ropes.

175
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,280
And while that wall idea has
received a lot of coverage,

176
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,440
it is by no means
Trump's only border plan.

177
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,320
One of his more benign-sounding, but
potentially no less dangerous ideas,

178
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,120
concerns the Border Patrol.

179
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,600
And first, let's be clear about
who they are.

180
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,920
They are part
of Customs and Border Protection.

181
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,560
They are not ICE, who you may know
from immigration raids.

182
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,440
They're also not Customs officers,

183
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,880
who you'll see at airports
and border crossings.

184
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,120
Nor are they the "Borders Patrol,"
a group of vigilantes

185
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,240
who defend abandoned
Borders Bookstores from raccoons.

186
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,800
No, the Border Patrol are the people
in green uniforms

187
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,680
who literally patrol
the boundaries of our country.

188
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,200
There are around 20,000 of them,

189
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,400
but Trump, in an executive order,
has called for them to add 5,000 more,

190
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,680
to tackle the many problems
that he sees on our southern border.

191
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,000
Let's stop the drugs and the crime
from pouring into our country.

192
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,200
You can certainly have terrorists,
you can have Islamic terrorists,

193
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,560
you can have anything
coming across the border.

194
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,720
We're gonna have a strong border
that people are going to respect

195
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,200
and the drugs are not gonna be
flowing across like gravy.

196
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,480
Now, that right there is what happens
when Donald Trump

197
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,200
starts a sentence feeling xenophobic
and ends it feeling hungry.

198
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,040
"We need to stop Mexicans coming in"

199
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,320
"like hot fudge sundaes
coming into my tummy."

200
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,280
"Three scoops, whipped cream,
no cherry 'cause I don't do fruit."

201
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,080
But for the record:

202
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,600
Border Patrol agents do a lot more
than just fight drugs, crime and gravy.

203
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,080
In recent years,
the number of Mexicans

204
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,720
apprehended crossing
the border has dramatically dropped,

205
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,920
and has now been surpassed

206
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,280
by the sharp rise in migrants
fleeing violence in Central America,

207
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,760
for whom there is a legal process
to seek asylum here,

208
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,120
meaning that agency's days can
frequently include moments like this.

209
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,160
The Bocche family
take their first tentative steps

210
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,400
into the United States of America.

211
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,880
Within seconds
the Border Patrol are on them.

212
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,120
There's no chase, no tension,
they expected to be caught.

213
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,600
As we film, another two figures emerge,
a mother and her daughter.

214
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,320
They're given blankets
to protect them from the cold.

215
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,320
And that's not what people expect
when they think of the border.

216
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,160
In the Venn diagram
of "hardened drug dealers"

217
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,880
and "people who need blankets,"

218
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,800
that middle section
is pretty much just Linus.

219
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,960
Oh, I'm sorry,
he is not a drug dealer ?

220
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,880
The messy hair, the stripy shirt,
the thumb sucking,

221
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:19,360
he sells ecstasy at raves, and he's
high on his own supply all the time !

222
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,680
There is no Great Pumpkin !
He's a junky, someone intervene !

223
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,920
But the truth is
it is moments like that there

224
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,880
that show how difficult the job
of a Border Patrol agent can be,

225
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,520
because in that moment,
they are delivering aid,

226
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,920
but later that same day, they may be
chasing down drug traffickers.

227
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,440
So it's a mixture between humanitarian
work and law enforcement,

228
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,320
and not everyone can do it.

229
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,400
And that is what makes Trump's plan

230
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,560
to expand the Border Patrol
by 25 percent so concerning.

231
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,640
Because if you hire agents
quickly and badly,

232
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,080
it can actually leave us
much less safe,

233
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,080
and have devastating
consequences.

234
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,600
And the reason we know this is because
we have been down this road before.

235
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,480
So tonight, I would like
to talk to you

236
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,880
about the last Border Patrol
hiring surge,

237
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,760
because it wasn't that long ago.

238
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,680
After the so-called bungling
of intelligence leading up to 9/11,

239
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,080
President George W. Bush is determined
to shore things up at the borders.

240
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,360
As part of that mandate,

241
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,920
the Border Patrol expanded
from 10,000 agents to 20,000.

242
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,360
It's true the late 2000s saw
a surge in Border Patrol agents

243
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,400
that was matched only by the surge
in the number

244
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,160
of reality shows
about people making cakes.

245
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,440
There were so many of those, you don't
even know which one of them I made up.

246
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,840
It was by the way "Cake Cucks"

247
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,920
which I guarantee you will be
in production sometime next week.

248
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,840
Now, to meet the surge's ambitious
targets, recruitment was aggressive.

249
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,760
And the government
advertised everywhere,

250
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,640
even at one point,
doing this.

251
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,360
The Border Patrol spent $8.4 million
sponsoring this car,

252
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,120
getting it detailed
and staffing recruiting booths.

253
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,080
That is honestly true !
They sponsored a NASCAR team,

254
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,920
putting the Border Patrol in such fine
company as other NASCAR sponsors

255
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,520
Depends Underwear
and Boudreaux's Butt Paste.

256
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,240
A product for, I assume, people
who want their butt pasted closed.

257
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,320
And look, that wasn't all. They also
ran slickly produced TV ads like this.

258
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,760
As a mobile law enforcement arm
of the Department of Homeland Security,

259
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,960
it is the job of the Border Patrol

260
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,760
to prevent terrorists
and terrorist weapons

261
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,960
and all those who seek to do us harm
from entering the United States.

262
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,720
The Border Patrol.
We protect America.

263
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,480
Are you up to the challenge ?

264
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,160
You have to admit, they make that job
look very exciting.

265
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,440
Although, in fairness,

266
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,480
anything said in that tone of voice
would be exciting.

267
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,800
"Here is my kitten.
I named him Bootsie."

268
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,560
"Don't wee on the rug, Bootsie !"

269
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,360
"I'm not sure he likes me
as much as I like him !"

270
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,400
But the truth of their job is

271
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,440
that most agents work alone
patrolling vast swaths of desert.

272
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,480
And while some days feature
bursts of action,

273
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,800
others can involve
absolutely nothing,

274
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,040
which can be challenging
in and of itself.

275
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,000
One of the larger problems is boredom.

276
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,400
It doesn't mean
that it's never dangerous.

277
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,160
There are bandits out there;
there are drug organizations out there.

278
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,000
What they're not really getting
is preparation

279
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:38,120
for the boring non-risky reality
of almost all of their career.

280
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:44,000
Exactly. Boredom is a significant part
of life as a Border Patrol agent.

281
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,680
And they should probably train for it.

282
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,960
For every hour they spend
in target practice,

283
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,920
they should probably spend ten hours
watching "Mozart In The Jungle".

284
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,400
Are you funny ?

285
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,280
Am I supposed to care about you ?

286
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,880
Who's that woman with the oboe ?

287
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,600
I'm confused, but I'm also bored.

288
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,240
But the big problem was that,
as they doubled in size,

289
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,880
meeting and maintaining
their hiring quotas meant

290
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,120
that their screening process
wasn't always very strong.

291
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,600
It was only late in the surge

292
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,080
that the CBP started giving applicants
polygraph tests,

293
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,360
something that most other federal
law-enforcement agencies do.

294
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,120
And listen to James Tomsheck,

295
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,120
who headed internal affairs for CBP
through most of the surge,

296
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,960
their findings indicated they probably
should have done that sooner.

297
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,160
The shocking discovery we found
was that more than half of the persons

298
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,840
who had cleared background
investigations

299
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,080
failed the polygraph examination.

300
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,000
The vast majority of them
providing detailed descriptions

301
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,720
of the criminal activity
they had been involved in.

302
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,880
Now just think about that.
Over half of CBP's applicants,

303
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,880
who had cleared the highest level
of background check,

304
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,840
were found unsuitable
for service.

305
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,600
And some of what they confessed to
was absolutely incredible.

306
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,160
One applicant admitted
to smoking marijuana

307
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,680
20,000 times in a 10-year-period,
kudos to that individual,

308
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,560
while another stated he had
"no independent recollection"

309
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,840
"of the events that resulted
in a blood-doused kitchen,"

310
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,240
"and was uncertain
if he had committed any crime"

311
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,440
"during his three-hour
black out."

312
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,600
Which I'm going to go ahead and say,
yes, you did commit a crime !

313
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,280
Or at the very least, you "really"
fucked up a soufflé.

314
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,080
I mean you fucked that thing up bad.

315
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,240
And the problems didn't stop
once the new agents were hired,

316
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,360
because the training
was also significantly cut back.

317
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,640
And that caused real issues,
as one trainer revealed while,

318
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,040
for some reason, being disguised
as an asthmatic scarecrow.

319
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,280
We are disguising the face and voice

320
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,840
of this veteran agent
and training instructor

321
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,920
because of fears of retaliation.

322
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,000
We went from a 20-week course
to a 12-week course.

323
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,680
So the standards were lowered.

324
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,000
Well, they say the standards
weren't lowered but they were.

325
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,120
What is happening there ?

326
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,880
He sounds like Jesse Ventura

327
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,440
after swallowing one of those novelty
cow voice noisemakers.

328
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,160
I know that it is really hard
to pay attention

329
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,640
to what Robot Neil Young
is saying there,

330
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,440
but it is genuinely worth listening to
where they cut corners.

331
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
The source told us

332
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,480
Spanish language classes and physical
training were cut back.

333
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,760
The person was so out of shape
I actually had to treat the trainee

334
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,280
and the bad guy got away.

335
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,000
Pretty much everybody gets through
the academy.

336
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,960
They cut back on Spanish
and physical training,

337
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,480
so the new standards affected

338
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,960
agent's abilities to talk
to the people they caught

339
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,680
and their ability to catch the people
they wanted to talk to,

340
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,960
which seem like
pretty essential facets of their job.

341
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,800
It's like if the training program
at Sea World left out

342
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,080
putting on a wet suit

343
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,280
and systematically driving carnivores
whales insane.

344
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,160
That's the whole job there.

345
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,080
Take them away.
You're left with nothing else.

346
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,640
And consequently as the ranks grew,

347
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,240
corruption and excessive force
skyrocketed.

348
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,680
Misconduct became such a problem
that, at one point,

349
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,800
the Border Patrol felt it needed
to issue a memo about the fact

350
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,120
their agents were averaging
two alcohol-related arrests per week.

351
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,360
And some agents' off-duty run-ins with
the law were even more spectacular.

352
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,960
Tonight, two border agents
are on leave,

353
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,760
after a woman says they put on
a lewd show during Cirque Du Soleil,

354
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,160
performing a sex act
right in front of children.

355
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,360
The accusations don't stop there.

356
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,200
The couple is suspected of being drunk
and violent.

357
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,640
Wow.
Now, I should tell you:

358
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,400
one agent was found guilty of
assaulting the woman who complained,

359
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,920
but both denied that anything sexual
was happening,

360
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,160
and they were found
not guilty of the sex act.

361
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,720
Presumably because they were
at Cirque Du Soleil,

362
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,120
where everything
looks like a sex act.

363
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,760
I'll show you: this is a sex act,
this is a sex act,

364
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,680
this is a wildly difficult sex act,
that is a bird-person sex act,

365
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,520
and I have absolutely
no idea what's happening there,

366
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,400
but I think it's the thing that
Steve Bannon is supposed to be good at.

367
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,480
And things got more serious than that.

368
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,720
Since 2005, 77 agents were arrested
or indicted for corruption.

369
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,960
And if you think about it,

370
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,480
Border Patrol agents are particularly
attractive to drug traffickers.

371
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,960
Remember: they often work on their own,
patrolling the border.

372
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,200
Which, as one journalist points out,
is a pretty potent recipe for trouble.

373
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,920
One Border Patrol agent can undo

374
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,240
an incredible amount of good that
all the other Border Patrol agents do.

375
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,440
One Border Patrol agent can wave in
tons of drugs.

376
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,640
- You mean that literally.
- Absolutely literally.

377
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,840
Yeah, this is one of the only cases
where someone saying "a ton of drugs"

378
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,840
actually means
"a literal ton of drugs."

379
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,920
No, Kevin.
You did not do a "ton" of drugs.

380
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,640
You took a Benadryl,
you made out with a goldfish,

381
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,920
and you passed out
with your head in the dishwasher.

382
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,760
Pull your life together.

383
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,560
Let me give you a taste of the kind
of spectacular corruption involved.

384
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,440
Take agent Joel Luna, who, it turned
out, had a brother in the Gulf Cartel,

385
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,120
and who was convicted
of engaging in organized crime,

386
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,600
with some pretty striking evidence
emerging during a house search.

387
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,840
We end up finding a safe, a black safe.

388
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,160
We found $89,000 in cash.

389
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,480
Joel Luna's commemorative
Border Patrol badge,

390
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,400
kilo and a half of cocaine,
methamphetamine.

391
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,120
A gun that's tied directly
to the Gulf Cartel.

392
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,560
It says Gulf Cartel on it.
It's hard to explain that away.

393
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,680
It's hard to explain why
your Border Patrol badge is in a safe

394
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,400
with cocaine, money,
and a cartel pistol.

395
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,040
Yeah. That is really hard to explain.
I mean the best I can do is,

396
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,200
"my badge had a drug problem that
it couldn't bear to tell me about,"

397
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,640
"so finally it decided to shoot itself
with a gun that we found on a case,"

398
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,320
"planning to die
surrounded by its money"

399
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,080
"because its views on death resembled
those of ancient Egyptians."

400
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,040
But even then, we are talking
about a sentient police badge

401
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,520
with an interest in Egyptology,

402
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,680
so you're already banking on a pretty
large suspension of disbelief there.

403
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,920
Oh, and you should know:

404
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,040
Luna was hired during
the last recruitment surge.

405
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,360
And CBP will tell you
what they told us,

406
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,440
that while some agents did disgrace
the badge with corruption,

407
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,080
the vast majority did not.

408
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,240
Although it is worth knowing
that Tomsheck,

409
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,640
the internal affairs guy, believes the
problem is much bigger than they imply.

410
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,600
Mr. Luna is not one bad apple.
He is part of a rate of corruption

411
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,880
that exceeded that of any other U.S.
federal law enforcement agency.

412
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,240
Ok, so it's less "one bad apple"

413
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,920
than "oh my god,
that is a lot of bad apples."

414
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,840
Which should really be the marketing
theme for "red delicious apples."

415
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,640
"Red delicious apples: well, at least
we got the 'red' part right !"

416
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,040
And it gets even worse.

417
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,320
Because remember:
these agents have guns.

418
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,720
And some have made
very bad decisions.

419
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,840
And you may have seen coverage
of some of the tragic incidents.

420
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,640
In a string of shootings
by the Border Patrol

421
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,800
that have stirred up emotions
at the border,

422
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,720
there's one case in particular that
has become a rallying cry for justice,

423
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,200
a shooting of a 16-year-old boy
named Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez.

424
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,000
They say their agents were threatened

425
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,040
by somebody throwing rocks
on this side of the fence,

426
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,240
but standing here,
the first thing you ask yourself is

427
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,600
could a 16 year old boy really threaten

428
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,120
somebody standing on top
of what's at least a 20 foot cliff

429
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,200
and on the other side of that fence ?

430
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,880
I mean, yeah,
that does seem pretty unlikely.

431
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,760
And to explain why, tune in next week,
when our main story will be

432
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,200
"Gravity: arch nemesis
to the concept of up."

433
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,880
Now, so you know:
that case is still in the courts

434
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,920
and agents can sometimes
feel threatened by rock throwers.

435
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,320
But, it is worth pointing out that
a report, which looked at 25 cases

436
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,360
where Border Patrol agents shot people
who'd thrown rocks concluded that

437
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,520
"too many cases do not appear to meet
the test of objective reasonableness"

438
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,520
"with regard
to the use of deadly force".

439
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,960
Which I believe is kind of
law-enforcement-legalese for

440
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,840
"holy shit, you shot some people
you should not have fucking shot at."

441
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,120
"Maybe don't do that as much !"

442
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,480
And there is one more thing
about the agent in that fence-shooting

443
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,360
that will not surprise you.

444
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:22,240
He was one of those persons hired
by the Border Patrol during the surge.

445
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,720
Of course he was.

446
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,080
And yet, despite
all of these warning signs,

447
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,160
we are about to embark upon another
ambitious Border Patrol hiring surge.

448
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,200
And CBP will tell you
not to worry about that,

449
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,160
that, in recent years, they've improved
hiring and made reforms.

450
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,520
For instance,
they've increased transparency,

451
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,640
and given agents more non-lethal
weapons, like pepper spray guns,

452
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,160
as well as rewriting their use-of-force
rulebook to, and I quote,

453
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,360
"prohibit the shooting of suspects
fleeing the scene"

454
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,680
"who do not pose a threat to themselves
or others."

455
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,120
And look that is great !

456
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,720
Although it does seem to be one
of those rules

457
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,160
that you shouldn't have
had to write down.

458
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,720
If you went to a zoo
and there were a giant sign that said,

459
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,240
"please don't finger the armadillos,"

460
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,680
you would wonder what the fuck had
happened before that sign went up.

461
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,840
But the problem is many other reforms
have not been made,

462
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,760
and it is hard to believe
that they will be

463
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,640
now that president
gravy-drugs is in charge.

464
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,920
In fact, there has already been talk
that hiring standards might drop again,

465
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,040
with suggestions
like a shorter polygraph,

466
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,520
or removing parts
of the entrance exam.

467
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,360
And most frustratingly of all,

468
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,040
there may be no reason for us
to take this risk

469
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,640
because a report from the inspector
general for Homeland Security

470
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,080
questions whether we even need
5,000 more Border Patrol agents.

471
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,600
And yet, Trump seems determined
to do this anyway. Who knows why ?

472
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,280
There's a fairly good chance
he only said 5,000

473
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,120
because someone told him
5 bazillion is not a real number.

474
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,080
And look: whatever your feelings

475
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,920
about the laws the Border Patrol
have been given to enforce,

476
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
and I have plenty of feelings on that,

477
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,680
you do want the best possible people
enforcing them.

478
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,560
Because if you don't, as we have seen,
bad things happen.

479
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,760
This is a story about the danger
of not learning from your mistakes.

480
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,760
And for the sake of everybody,
people on both sides of the border,

481
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:17,000
and the good Border Patrol agents
just trying to do a difficult job well,

482
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,880
if we are going to hire
all these new people,

483
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,160
the very least we can do is
be more careful this time around.

484
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,280
And one tiny step would be
to have recruitment ads

485
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,520
that show potential agents
what the job is "really" like.

486
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,600
The Border Patrol !

487
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,560
We protect America
and we're hiring again,

488
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,040
but this time,
we're going to do it right.

489
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,040
So if you're looking for an exciting,
heart pounding adventure,

490
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:47,120
maybe go skydiving, or try Parkour,
or do whatever the fuck this is.

491
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,520
But the Border Patrol
may not be for you

492
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,840
because a lot of the time,
the job looks less like this,

493
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,240
and more like this.

494
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:04,480
That's right. Just you, the desert,
and nothing for miles around.

495
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,760
This could be your lunch break.

496
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,280
This is a job that can combine hours
of boredom

497
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,200
with sudden bursts of action.

498
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,880
Oh shit !
I got people moving; I need back up.

499
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,880
And about that action:

500
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,520
it definitely can involve people
entering illegally or drug smugglers,

501
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,360
but a surprising
amount of the time,

502
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,400
it involves desperate migrants for whom
you're the first point of contact

503
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,320
in a system ill-equipped
to cater to their needs.

504
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,160
Um... these guys are.

505
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,400
Here.

506
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,600
- Gracias.
- I don't...

507
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,240
Shit.

508
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,080
This job is not for everyone

509
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,760
and that's why this time we're not
advertising with NASCAR.

510
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:08,360
Instead, we're recruiting with this
sweet-ass Honda Odyssey:

511
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,920
a practical car
for reasonable, methodical people.

512
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,800
Please make sure you read
the entirety of its nuanced text

513
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,440
before making any decisions,
and some of it's in Spanish

514
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,600
because it would be really useful
if you can speak that.

515
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,920
But just to be clear, if you want
to fuck at Cirque du Soleil,

516
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,880
this is not the job for you,
and we will find out.

517
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,280
Last question.

518
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,800
Have you ever, and I mean ever,
considered having sexual relations

519
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,240
at a performance of exotically dressed
Canadian acrobats ?

520
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,200
No.

521
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,280
We're done here.

522
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,600
The point is,
if you're kind, physically fit,

523
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,280
impervious to bribery or boredom,
and you want to serve your country

524
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,840
by enforcing a controversial
and ever-changing set of policies

525
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,360
in the most humane way possible,
then give us a call.

526
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,440
The Border Patrol ! We're hiring !
Wish us luck with that !

527
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,680
Circus fuckers need not apply.

528
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,000
Thank you so much for watching !
We'll see you next week, good night !
