LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,560
SEASON IV
EPISODE 14

3
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,360
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,240
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

5
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,720
A quick word regarding
last night's attacks in London,

6
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,680
where seven people were killed
and multiple people were injured.

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,200
Our thoughts
go out to everyone affected.

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,000
But as a British person
living in America,

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,280
I feel compelled to address
a certain theme

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,840
that emerged through
American coverage of this tragedy.

11
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,760
The UK is reeling this morning
from yet another terrorist attack.

12
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,800
- A city reeling from a terror attack.
- The UK under siege, essentially.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,400
London is under siege.

14
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,120
A country and a city that feels
in some ways under siege.

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,240
Ok, here is the thing: for the record,
in no way is Britain under siege.

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,360
Is it upset ? Yes.
Is it pissed off ?

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,480
You fucking bet it's pissed off.

18
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,240
But to say it's under siege,
and that its people are reeling,

19
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,520
is to imply that it's weak enough
to be brought to its knees

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,640
by three monumental assholes.

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,040
And that as an idea is insulting.

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,040
British people were so irritated
by headlines about Britain reeling,

23
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,920
like this one in the New York Times,
they took to Twitter this morning,

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
using the hashtag things
that leave Britain reeling,

25
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,280
to show things that,
unlike terrorists,

26
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,840
actually do have the ability
to rock them to their very core,

27
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,200
like, accidental eye contact
on the tube or in a lift,

28
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,840
and when people make tea
in the microwave,

29
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,720
accompanied with a GIF
of a monkey screaming.

30
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,200
It was an uplifting demonstration
of quintessentially British defiance.

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,520
The British people are never going
to let terror change their way of life.

32
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
And if you need proof of this,
just look at this footage

33
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,000
of people being evacuated
from the scene.

34
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,920
You see that guy ? He refused
to leave his pint of beer behind.

35
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,760
That is a one man walking
Keep Calm and Carry On poster.

36
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,200
Perhaps my favorite reaction
of all came from this man,

37
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,720
who was in a restaurant
and witnessed the attacks first-hand.

38
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,520
He went back
to that restaurant

39
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,080
to try and pay his bill
and tip the staff,

40
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,800
and when a reporter asked whether
he was worried about his safety,

41
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,880
this was his incredible
response.

42
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,800
If me having a gin and tonic with my
friends, flirting with handsome men,

43
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,800
hanging out with brilliant women,
is what offends these people so much,

44
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,560
I'm going to do it more, not less,
that's what makes London so great.

45
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,000
Fuck yeah, it is !

46
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,640
I sincerely hope that that guy
is out on the town tonight,

47
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,800
pounding down gin and tonics
and flirting with every man he sees.

48
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,640
To you sir, I say this: cheers.

49
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,520
Cheers to you !

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,840
But for now,
let's move on to Vladimir Putin.

51
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,600
Perhaps the biggest threat
to the United States

52
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,040
after the President
of the United States.

53
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,200
Putin was appearing

54
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,080
in newly released clips for the
upcoming Oliver Stone series on him,

55
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,920
which looks like a truly depressing
episode of Carpool Karaoke,

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,560
and also appearing as guest of honor
on Megyn Kelly's new NBC show,

57
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,680
which I assume is called, forget
everything I said on FOX since 2004.

58
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,480
But the most notable thing
Putin said,

59
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,040
was when he admitted,
for the first time,

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,200
that Russian citizens may have been
involved in hacking the U.S. election.

61
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,080
Hackers are free-spirited people,
like artists.

62
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,800
If they wake up in the morning
in a good mood, they paint pictures.

63
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,560
Same way with hackers.
They wake up one morning,

64
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,040
read that something is going on
in international relations,

65
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,640
and if they are patriotically minded,
they contribute in their own way.

66
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,320
Sure. Hackers are just artistic
types looking for inspiration.

67
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,600
They're like an improv troupe who said:
we need a location to get started.

68
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,800
And someone in the audience shouted:
inside the email server at the DNC.

69
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,760
Putin's coy answer there has now
just added smoke to the concerns

70
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,080
about Russia's connections
to the Trump administration.

71
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,400
Smoke that got ever
so slightly thicker,

72
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,640
after some news that got a bit lost
in other developments.

73
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,920
The Washington Post
out with a report

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,080
alleging the White House
is looking to give Russia back

75
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,400
its compounds
in Maryland and New York.

76
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,120
Russian officials were ousted
from those diplomatic compounds,

77
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
by the Obama administration
in late December

78
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,120
in a direct response to Moscow's
interference in the 2016 election.

79
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,320
It seems the U.S. is considering
giving Russia back two compounds,

80
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,640
which have, since the Reagan era, been
associated with spying on Americans.

81
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,840
With Trump in office, it seems Putin
is about as likely to get what he wants

82
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,360
as a Make-A-Wish kid
who wants to meet Jason Mraz.

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,400
Really ? Jason's definitely available.
I'm just saying...

84
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,360
Really ?

85
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,640
This is worrying
because the compounds

86
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,160
are connected to the scandal
that tripped up Michael Flynn,

87
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,400
whose face answers the question,
what if an eagle hated Muslims ?

88
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,240
You may remember
that Flynn got in trouble

89
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,080
for misleading answers about
phone calls with Russia's ambassador

90
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,840
during the Trump transition.

91
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,600
One subject was allegedly
whether Donald Trump

92
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,760
would roll back sanctions
on Russia,

93
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,040
sanctions that included
closing these two compounds.

94
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,400
It seems that not only
may that happen,

95
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,040
but we're not really
expecting much in return.

96
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,880
The Trump administration appears to be
willing to give back those 2 compounds,

97
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,680
one in Maryland and one in New York
to the Russians

98
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,560
that had been seized
by the Obama administration.

99
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,080
But Russia's not coming to the table
to give us anything back.

100
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,120
And that is why this looks so bad.

101
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,040
Trump may be handing
the Russians back compounds

102
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,800
in the midst of a special
counsel investigating

103
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,960
whether his campaign
colluded with Russia,

104
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,240
an investigation that includes
the issue of those very compounds

105
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,280
he may now be returning,
and he could be doing all of this

106
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,920
while receiving nothing
for America in return.

107
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,400
I kind of hope Putin
does have a golden shower tape of him,

108
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,080
because otherwise, Trump is the worst
dealmaker in human history.

109
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,840
Which shouldn't be a surprise,

110
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,360
because we all remember
the name of his famous book:

111
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,040
The art of the...
Look I never wanted any of this.

112
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,160
This was a branding exercise
that got out of hand.

113
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,960
God the Russians
are on the phone again,

114
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,360
tell them I'm not here, Jared,
what did you do, Jared ?

115
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,320
Shit !

116
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,480
And now, this...

117
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,600
And now, 60 Minutes anchors
are still prompting people

118
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,400
to give them the exact sound bites
they need.

119
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,480
Does that not strike you
as incredibly cynical ?

120
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,720
It's incredibly cynical.
That's exactly what it is.

121
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,960
- Do you see it as a moral obligation ?
- Yeah. It's a moral obligation.

122
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,360
It was classified information.

123
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,880
Effective and overwhelming response.

124
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,040
And empowering a criminal network.

125
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,880
It was just a coincidence.

126
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,600
And it takes off.

127
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,840
That's why it's powerful.

128
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,440
The same way.

129
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,280
And I'm five years old.

130
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,240
500 a day.

131
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,360
Half a billion dollars.

132
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,640
- In cash ?
- In cash.

133
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,040
Divided.

134
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,760
- You wanted more.
- More.

135
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,120
- So, that's your shtick ?
- My shtick.

136
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,720
Moving on.

137
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,400
Our main story tonight concerns earth,
the adopted home world of Bjork.

138
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,840
What are you ?

139
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,920
Now the reason we have to talk
about earth tonight is this.

140
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,000
President Trump revealing his decision
to the country, to the world.

141
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,520
"We're out", he says, pulling out
of the Paris Climate Accord.

142
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,560
I was elected to represent...

143
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,840
the citizens of Pittsburgh,
not Paris.

144
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,240
First, relax, no one, for a second,
thought that you represented Paris.

145
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,680
Partly because Paris is represented
by a smoking French bulldog

146
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,960
who found the first course
to be derivative and jejune.

147
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,440
Trump announced he would pull out
of the Paris Climate Agreement.

148
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,320
Which is hardly surprising as a title,
it is so off-brand for him,

149
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,960
it might have been called the globalist
cuck surrender, or a light jog.

150
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,800
Yet, pulling out of this
is a huge deal.

151
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,080
To understand why, it helps
to keep in mind one key number,

152
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,880
and it's two degrees Celsius.

153
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,680
It's a bit of a shorthand,
but the concern is that,

154
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,000
if we fail to limit temperature
rise to that number,

155
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,360
things get very bad,
and potentially irreversible.

156
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,400
Scientists say we'll likely see
longer droughts and heat waves,

157
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,920
which could cause big disruptions
to the world's food supply.

158
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,120
If we don't start
with rapid emissions reductions

159
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,160
and substantial emissions reductions,
then we'll pass a danger point,

160
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,080
beyond which the consequences
for many people and countries on earth

161
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,720
will simply become unacceptable
and eventually disastrous.

162
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,800
It's true, and we are not talking
about a fictional apocalypse

163
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,680
like the one in the movie, 2012.

164
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,160
We're talking about an actual
global disaster, like the movie, 2012.

165
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,720
And the serious danger may actually
be more imminent than you think.

166
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,920
To have a good chance of avoiding
the 2 degree threshold,

167
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,640
human emissions of CO2 should
stay below this level, in total.

168
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,320
This is our so-called carbon budget.
And by the end of last year,

169
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,880
we were estimated
to already be up to here.

170
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,600
If current emissions trends continue,

171
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,080
we would go above that critical line
in about 20 years.

172
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,400
And that is not a long time !

173
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,360
20 years ago,
South Park was on TV,

174
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,960
Foo Fighters were touring,
and Paul Rudd looked like this.

175
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,840
What I'm saying is:
20 years ago was basically now !

176
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,840
So the Paris Agreement's central aim
was to try and keep

177
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,320
our global temperature rise
below that 2 degree threshold.

178
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,280
For that, each signatory
would set their own goals,

179
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,720
with a plan to reconvene
every five years,

180
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,080
to ideally
set more ambitious targets.

181
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,840
And look: it was not perfect.

182
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,120
Some critics at the time felt
that it did not go far enough.

183
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,120
But the key achievement was,
for the very first time,

184
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,160
getting virtually the entire world,
including China and India,

185
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,880
to commit to taking action.

186
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,240
It was a historic moment,
and it was celebrated like this.

187
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,880
The moment the world agreed
to tackle climate change.

188
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,520
And so the Paris Agreement
was born.

189
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,640
Emotions spilled over.

190
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,960
So much so that Laurent Fabius
banged the gavel again.

191
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,800
So, I have been asked
to bang the gavel again.

192
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,960
It's a little gavel, but I think
it can do great things.

193
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,360
Okay, listen, I'll say this...

194
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,880
if you are trying to convince
people of the gravity of a moment,

195
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,600
maybe don't use such
a humiliatingly shitty gavel

196
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,680
because it just undercuts
what you're trying to say.

197
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,360
It would not be appropriate for a judge
to conclude a death penalty by saying,

198
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,320
I hereby sentence you
to hang by the neck until dead.

199
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,760
May God have mercy
upon your soul.

200
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,480
Right ?

201
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,360
Solemn moment,
solemn moment for everybody.

202
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,320
So, why did Trump announce
that he would pull out this week ?

203
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,360
One clue may've come
during his speech on Thursday,

204
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,080
when he talked
about that happy celebration,

205
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,600
but seemed to see
something sinister in it.

206
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,800
The rest of the world applauded
when we signed the Paris Agreement.

207
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,600
They went wild.
They were so happy.

208
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,640
For the simple reason
that it put our country,

209
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,600
the United States of America,
which we all love,

210
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,120
at a very big
economic disadvantage.

211
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,440
What are you talking about ?

212
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,680
They were happy because
they secured a landmark victory

213
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,040
for the future of the planet,
you fucking egomaniac !

214
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,880
The whole world is not secretly
conspiring against the United States.

215
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,200
The only thing the whole world
is secretly conspiring to do

216
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,320
is convince everyone
that there are two Olsen twins.

217
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,640
No way it is just one girl, moving
very quickly backwards and forwards.

218
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,480
It's an optical illusion. The Olsen
twins thing is a massive scam.

219
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,080
The whole world is in on it,

220
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,040
and the only thing that
I don't quite know yet is why.

221
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,920
But we don't have time for that.

222
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,000
The point is, if the agreement was
a scheme to hurt American businesses,

223
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,000
you know who
that might be news to ?

224
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,680
Many American businesses.

225
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,760
Because they were not just
in favor of this agreement,

226
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,200
they even made a last-ditch
attempt to change Trump's mind.

227
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,240
25 companies,
including Microsoft and Intel

228
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,360
have purchased a fullpage
ad in today's New York Times

229
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,200
arguing, the agreement generates jobs
and economic growth.

230
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,040
He was never going to be convinced
by an ad in the New York Times.

231
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,120
How was he going to see it ?

232
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,640
If the companies
wanted to get his attention,

233
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,080
they needed to talk KFC
into putting out a full-bucket ad.

234
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,000
Which, he would read on the toilet,
while eating chicken.

235
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,560
Because that, at its core,
is who our President is.

236
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,880
But rather than listening
to those companies,

237
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,800
the President was getting advice
from climate change skeptics

238
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,600
like his EPA Chief, Scott Pruitt, and
human custody hearing Steve Bannon.

239
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,880
Although really,
Trump's actions were in keeping

240
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,760
with a long-held skepticism that
he has concerning climate change.

241
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,680
He has called it expensive bullshit,
and a hoax created by China,

242
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,520
and he repeatedly brought that idea
up on the campaign trail,

243
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,040
often before losing track
of what he was talking about.

244
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,440
China isn't abiding by anything.

245
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,160
They're buying all of our coal;
we can't use coal anymore.

246
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,960
They're buying our coal.

247
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,200
Now when you talk about the planet,
it's so big out there

248
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,280
we're here, they're there, it's like
they're our next-door neighbor.

249
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,240
In terms of the universe.
Miss Universe, by the way,

250
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,000
I made a great deal when I sold it,
did I get rich.

251
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,640
That was a great deal.

252
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,680
They broke my choppers, they said
he talks about illegal immigration,

253
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,320
we are not going to put him
on television.

254
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,520
NBC, I made a great deal
with them, just like an amazing deal.

255
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,680
Why can't you finish a thought ?

256
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,520
That was 36 seconds, touching on
at least 7 different topics,

257
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,480
including the non-phrase,
broke my choppers,

258
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,840
and yet he did not conclude
a single thought there.

259
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,560
A goldfish would hear that speech
and go, hey, hey, hey focus !

260
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,800
Get back to China !
You were talking about China !

261
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,360
What is wrong with this...
God I'm drowning !

262
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,000
When you combine
Trump's lack of attention to detail,

263
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,520
with his deep-rooted paranoia,
you get misleading reasons

264
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,480
that he cited on Thursday
for pulling out of Paris.

265
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,400
He seemed to think
the agreement committed America

266
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,920
to shutting down
coal-fired power plants.

267
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,240
China will be allowed to build
hundreds of additional coal plants.

268
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,080
We can't build the plants, but they
can, according to this agreement.

269
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,240
India will be allowed to double
its coal production by 2020.

270
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Think of it. India can double
their coal production.

271
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,920
We're supposed to get rid of ours.

272
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,240
For the record, the agreement
doesn't actually ban America

273
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,880
from building coal plants.

274
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,360
It doesn't even contain
the word "coal".

275
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,120
Each country sets its own goals
that it can meet however it wants.

276
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,880
So that is wrong. As is the fact
that Trump said in his speech,

277
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,600
"America would continue
to be the cleanest"

278
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,960
"and most environmentally-friendly
country on Earth",

279
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,000
which is objectively untrue,
because over history,

280
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,080
the U.S. has emitted by far more
carbon than any other country,

281
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,000
and we still emit more per person
than almost any other nation.

282
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,320
So that's like Mark Wahlberg
saying he's going to continue

283
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,680
to be the best dentist on the planet.

284
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,920
How are you going to do that ?
That's not what you are, Mark.

285
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,200
Maybe you could decide to do that.
But you're definitely not doing it now.

286
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,200
There is Trump's concern
over the Green Climate Fund,

287
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,040
which finances projects
in developing nations,

288
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,800
helping them adapt
to the impacts of climate change.

289
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,120
Watch now as Trump
describes that fund.

290
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,280
The Green Fund would likely
obligate the United States to commit

291
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,080
potentially
tens of billions of dollars

292
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,960
of which the United States
has already handed over

293
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,440
$1 billion.

294
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,640
Nobody else is even close.

295
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,400
To his credit, that is an impressive
amount of misleading bullshit

296
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,840
in very few words.

297
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,480
In fact, here is everything
that he just said.

298
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,640
Let's break those words down.
First: "The Green Fund".

299
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,520
It's not called "The Green Fund"
it's called "The Green Climate Fund".

300
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,280
Then, "would likely obligate
the United States to commit money".

301
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,640
There is no enforcement
mechanism in the Paris Agreement.

302
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,120
The U.S. could easily
just refuse to pay the bill,

303
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,520
something Donald Trump
has a lifetime of practice doing.

304
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,080
As for the "potentially tens
of billions of dollars ?"

305
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,840
No, we committed
three billion dollars.

306
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,040
You can't just inflate three
to "potentially tens".

307
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,040
I can't say that you have had
"potentially tens" of failed marriages.

308
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,200
I can only say that you've had three.
Because you have.

309
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,360
You have had
three failed marriages,

310
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,320
and yes, I am very much including
your current one.

311
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:15,080
Finally, "nobody else is even close"
to paying more ?

312
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,160
That is just willfully misleading.

313
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,200
While we have given the most
so far in sheer dollars,

314
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,760
we are one of the richest countries,
and one of the top emitters.

315
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,920
And when you rank contributions
as a fraction of GDP, we are 32nd.

316
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,880
Trump's description of the agreement
is so flamboyantly deceptive,

317
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,480
would've been equally accurate to say
compliance with the Paris Agreement

318
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,880
would likely require all ducks
to wear jean shorts,

319
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,840
and that it would potentially cost
each and every American citizen

320
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,480
five fish and a dump-truck
full of hamsters.

321
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,760
That would be
as true as what he just said.

322
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:56,360
And even when he tried to strike
a reassuring tone, he got it wrong.

323
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,360
So we're getting out
but we will start to negotiate

324
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,520
and we will see if we can make
a deal that's fair.

325
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,960
And if we can, that's great.
And if we can't, that's fine.

326
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,400
Except no, it is not fine, is it ?

327
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,000
Because, the leaders of Germany,
France, and Italy said in a statement,

328
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,120
"we firmly believe that the Paris
Agreement cannot be renegotiated."

329
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,320
And I would not test
Europe's leaders

330
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,120
when it comes to pulling out
of a major international agreement.

331
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,240
Britain is trying that bullshit
right now with Brexit,

332
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,880
and maybe you can send your
demands to the same email address

333
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,560
that Europe set up for that.

334
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,720
It's "lick dot our nuts
at go fuck yourselves dot EU".

335
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,160
So, drop them a line.
They'll answer.

336
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,920
But I have saved for last Trump's
most ludicrous misunderstanding.

337
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,600
For a man who cites the agreement's
strict, onerous and draconian terms,

338
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,920
what he does not seem to comprehend
is each nation sets its own goals,

339
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,360
and more importantly:
the whole thing is fucking voluntary.

340
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,760
The agreement as a whole
is not legally binding

341
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,480
and doesn't penalize nations
who fail to meet their commitments.

342
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,960
But it does include a process designed
to shame them into compliance.

343
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,000
It's true,
the only penalty was shame.

344
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,680
Unfortunately, this president
is immune to the very concept of that.

345
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,440
If they even tried to shame him
into compliance,

346
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,000
he could just hold up this photo
of him in a too short bathrobe

347
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,800
on what appears to be
a child's bed, and say,

348
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,320
"I posed for that."

349
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,520
"You cannot hurt me any more
than I've already hurt myself."

350
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,120
And you may be thinking:

351
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,320
"If it's all voluntary,
then what is the harm in leaving ?"

352
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,320
The truth is it's substantial.

353
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,440
Let's start with just the harm to
America's standing in the world alone.

354
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,760
Trump's decision to leave the agreement
has pissed off almost everyone.

355
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,400
German Chancellor Angela Merkel
called it extremely regrettable.

356
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,240
Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau
called it disheartening.

357
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,040
And the Vatican went further,

358
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,280
saying Mr. Trump's decision
was a disaster for everyone.

359
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,680
We are getting shit-talked
by the Vatican.

360
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,920
And not the Nazi Pope, the cool one !
That's worse.

361
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,960
That is like getting into a Twitter
fight with the Dalai Lama.

362
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,840
He doesn't snap often,
but when he snaps, he snaps hard.

363
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,680
That reputational harm can have
real costs for businesses abroad.

364
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,160
An environmental negotiator who worked
in the George W. Bush administration

365
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,840
described this decision as,

366
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,000
"the worst thing for brand America
since Abu Ghraib."

367
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,240
And that is rough,
because a bad association

368
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,680
can stick with a brand
for a long time.

369
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,720
Just ask Sexual Assault Pudding Cups,
Double Murder Car Rentals,

370
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,000
or Mr. Touchy's Fresh 'N
Tasty Pedo-Sandwiches.

371
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,360
And there is the harm
to American workers,

372
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,080
the very people
Trump is claiming to protect.

373
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,040
Most of the world now realizes
that in order to reduce emissions,

374
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,920
we need to shift
to renewable forms of energy.

375
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,440
And the more
a government encourages that,

376
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,480
the quicker costs come down,
and the more likely that that country

377
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,040
is to be at the forefront
of a new industry,

378
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,440
creating countless jobs
in the process.

379
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,840
And you know who knows that ?
China.

380
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,880
Or, as Trump would say, Chiiina.

381
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,040
Trump just handed
a huge advantage to them.

382
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,200
They've not only canceled plans

383
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,920
to build more than
100 coalfired power plants,

384
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,760
they're also increasing
investment elsewhere.

385
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,480
China plans to spend more than $360
billion on renewable energy by 2020,

386
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,400
which it says will create
at least 13 million new jobs.

387
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,920
In a way, Trump is fulfilling
his campaign promise:

388
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,080
he is creating millions of new jobs,
he's doing it for the wrong country.

389
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,640
If you want proof
that the jobs of today and tomorrow

390
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,440
are in renewable energy, France's
new president, Emanuel Macron,

391
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,160
issued a call this week
to America's workforce.

392
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,600
To all scientists, engineers,
entrepreneurs, responsible citizens

393
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,240
who were disappointed by the decision
of the President of the United States,

394
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:15,320
I want to say that they will find
in France a second homeland.

395
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,200
I call on them,
come and work here with us.

396
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,600
I guess what he's saying there
is "be...our...guest !"

397
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,680
Be our guest !
Put our service to the test !

398
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,840
Tie a napkin 'round your neck...
We don't have time for this.

399
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,480
I'm sorry, Lumiere.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Potts.

400
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,960
I'm sorry, Cogsworth.
You gotta go !

401
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,040
Quick, this is my fault. Get the fuck
out of here, you little fuckers !

402
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,120
The real concern here

403
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,240
is that America's absence
from the Paris Agreement

404
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,160
could make other countries less
inclined to meet their commitments.

405
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,520
That could quickly
become catastrophic.

406
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,280
That brings us to our final point:
given that we cannot afford

407
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,240
to just wait four years to vote Trump
out of office, what can be done now ?

408
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,280
For starters, companies
need to continue to step up.

409
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,720
And to their credit, some like
Walmart and Bank of America

410
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,000
have set deadlines to power themselves
completely with renewable energy.

411
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,800
Nearly half of Fortune 500 companies,
including Philip Morris International

412
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,640
have pledged to reduce their
carbon footprint in the coming years.

413
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,600
This is a story where Walmart,
Bank of America and Philip Morris

414
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,760
end up being the good guys.

415
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,800
Which feels inherently surprising.

416
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,360
It's like I just said:
"Great news, everyone: Ebola, ISIS,"

417
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,400
"that dentist who shot Cecil the Lion
are gonna save the planet for us !"

418
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,800
Thanks, guys ! You're the best !
You are the best !

419
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,960
It is not just companies
stepping up.

420
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,720
In the wake of Trump's decision,
multiple governors have announced

421
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,600
their intention to hold themselves
to the Paris Agreement goals.

422
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,680
As have many mayors, including,
notably, the mayor of Pittsburgh,

423
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,240
the city that Trump cited as the reason
he was pulling out of the agreement.

424
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,960
Their mayor, Bill Peduto,
was pretty clear

425
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,560
about what he thinks
about Trump's decision.

426
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,280
Pittsburgh is the poster child
of showing why the Paris Agreement

427
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,080
is good economics
for the United States,

428
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,560
and what we did today
sets us back decades.

429
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,600
That is pleasantly surprising
on so many levels.

430
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,520
Not the least of which is,
I had always just assumed

431
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,600
that Pittsburgh's mayor was a Heinz
ketchup-drenched Lombardi trophy.

432
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,520
So we're all learning
a lot of things tonight.

433
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,840
This means that the onus is on
politicians at the state-local level

434
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,560
to do what Donald Trump
cannot be bothered to.

435
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,040
And unfortunately, that means
that you now need to find out

436
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,680
where your mayor, your governor,
and even your state reps stand

437
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,880
on climate change.

438
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,520
And first, you'll have
to find out who they are,

439
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,560
but then you will need
to find out their positions.

440
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,360
And maybe you'll get lucky,
maybe yours is great.

441
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,400
Or maybe you live in Pennsylvania,

442
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,480
and you're represented
by State Senator Scott Wagner,

443
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,520
who has an interesting theory for
what might be causing global warming.

444
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,160
The Earth moves closer to the Sun
every year. We have more people.

445
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,080
Humans have warm bodies,
so is heat coming off ?

446
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,160
We're going
through a lot of change,

447
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,800
but we are, as a society,
doing the best we can.

448
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,240
I don't even know
where to begin there.

449
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,760
I mean, yes, the Earth does move
closer to the sun every year.

450
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,320
But then it moves
further away from the sun.

451
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,680
Because that is
what a fucking year is.

452
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,960
Our body heat
is not warming the planet.

453
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,600
And we are clearly
not doing the best we can,

454
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,600
because we keep putting idiots like
Scott Wagner in positions of power !

455
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,880
And he is not alone.
In North Carolina,

456
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,960
they're considering a bill
that would freeze progress

457
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,240
that that state has made
towards renewable energy

458
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,000
and one of the people
who would have a vote on that

459
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,000
is State Rep. Larry Pittman.

460
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,200
So, what is Larry's
nuanced take on climate ?

461
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,520
Our climate runs on a cycle.

462
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,760
It goes up and it goes down
and the Lord designed it that way.

463
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,760
And the main thing
that causes global warning

464
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,480
is the Earth's relationship
to a big ball of gas

465
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,240
that's burning out there,
that we call the sun.

466
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,680
And it is the height of hubris
for human beings

467
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,160
to think that we can have
any effect on that.

468
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,280
No, Larry, no.

469
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,520
The height of hubris is not opposing
climate change against God's will.

470
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,720
The height of hubris is,
according to Wikipedia,

471
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,520
six-foot-two, and he just pulled
us out of the Paris Agreement.

472
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,080
If your local reps resemble
those guys in any way, you are going,

473
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,040
you're gonna need to work to get
them out of office as soon as you can.

474
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,560
And all of this is going to take work,
attention, and energy.

475
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,200
And I know that's not easy.

476
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,840
But Trump may have inadvertently
done us a tiny favor this week:

477
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,680
the problem with climate change
is that it's always felt so abstract,

478
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,080
impersonal,
and far off into the future.

479
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,880
The usual symbols that we use
don't do much to fix or help that

480
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,960
it's either a graph
that's difficult to understand,

481
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,320
or a sad polar bear
on a small piece of ice.

482
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,360
And it's hard to get emotionally
fired up over that.

483
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,080
I don't even know that bear.
He could be a dick.

484
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:19,520
But, finally, this week,
the climate change movement

485
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,920
may have gotten
a symbol to rally around.

486
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,920
Because apparently,
it was never quite enough for us

487
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,720
to motivate ourselves out of love
for this large, gassy orb.

488
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,160
But maybe, just maybe,
we can now motivate ourselves

489
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,280
to do something
out of our loathing of this one.

490
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,640
And now, this.

491
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,280
And now,
still more 60 Minutes anchors

492
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,800
prompting people to give them
the exact sound bites they need.

493
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,920
We're gonna put $456 million
to go to an island of 50 people ?

494
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,960
The bridge to nowhere.

495
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,920
Each person has a purpose.

496
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,960
24 hours a day.

497
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,000
- You got greedy.
- I got greedy.

498
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,480
Bribes and threats.

499
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,160
Bribes.

500
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,960
Covering up tests.

501
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,680
Fake urine.

502
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,120
You name it.

503
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,680
That's basically what happened.

504
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,640
Car's in charge.

505
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,400
It's locked.

506
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,560
- This is a private home ?
- Yes.

507
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,400
- We're guinea pigs.
- Yes.

508
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,720
That's an occupational hazard.

509
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Genuine fake
extra virgin olive oil.

510
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,880
You admit that you participated

511
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,360
in a system that just willy-nilly
jacked prices way up.

512
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,920
- I said anything about willy-nilly ?
- I'm saying willy-nilly.

513
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,280
I'm not saying that !

514
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,720
Thank you so much for watching.
See you next week. Good night !

515
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,280
