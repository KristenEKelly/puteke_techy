00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,720
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,280
SEASON IV
EPISODE 2

3
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,560
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,640
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,520
We begin with President Trump.

6
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,680
Two words that will always sound
unnatural together,

7
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,960
like "fuckable clown"
or "Wolf Blitzer".

8
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,960
The reason we start with him is,
Trump dominates the news cycle

9
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,680
the way a fart dominates
the interior of a Volkswagen Beetle.

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,480
There is no escape from him.
Now just a case in point:

11
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,520
last night, Trump held
a pointless rally in Florida,

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,360
which got roadblock coverage
across cable news.

13
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,160
While his speech
was mostly boilerplate Trump,

14
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,640
the media is fake, Chicago is
a nightmare, I'm the greatest,

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,840
one thing warning about the danger
of refugees caught people's attention:

16
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,440
You look at what's happening
last night in Sweden.

17
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,920
Sweden, who would believe this.
They took in large numbers.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,800
Having problems
like they never thought possible.

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,040
No ! What happened there ?

20
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,280
Did someone blow up Sweden's
most famous landmark,

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,200
and if they did, what was it ?

22
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,920
There was just one little
problem with what the president said

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,640
and this news clip sums it up:

24
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,720
We start with a plea from Sweden
to the US government,

25
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,400
asking what is your president
talking about ?

26
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,440
Yeah, it turns out,
there was no terror attack.

27
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,960
A quick message to all other
countries on earth:

28
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,960
you are going to find
yourself wanting to ask:

29
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,920
"what is your president
talking about a great deal ?"

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,320
The answer is almost always going
to be: "We have no fucking idea."

31
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,840
Trump admitted his comment
was in reference to a story

32
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,440
broadcast on FOX News
concerning immigrants and Sweden.

33
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,000
Sifting through Trump's brain
to see why he said something

34
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,400
is like examining a shark's
stomach to see what it ate.

35
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,320
There's a sea urchin,
a decomposed dolphin skull.

36
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,440
A FOX news segment on Sweden.
It's stuck in its throat.

37
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,680
Here is where we're at:
Trump can dominate the news

38
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,400
merely by referencing something
that didn't happen in Sweden.

39
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:49,280
This week has seen a great deal of
fascinating stories go under-covered !

40
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,320
The estranged half-brother
of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un

41
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,480
poisoned as he waited for a flight.

42
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,160
That story is both incredible
and not entirely surprising.

43
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,280
If you're associated with Kim Jong Un,
your odds of being murdered

44
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,640
are around the same as if you live
in a town Jessica Fletcher visits.

45
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,280
Death follows that woman
wherever she goes.

46
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,120
I'll tell you why, because, and this
is true, she's a serial killer.

47
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,880
Hashtag Jessica Fletcher
is a serial killer.

48
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,480
It wasn't so much who was killed
that was surprising. It was how.

49
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,200
One of the two women accused
of carrying out the hit now says

50
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,400
she thought she was taking part
in a TV prank show.

51
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,160
Police say the suspect claims
she was paid to convince men

52
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,400
to close their eyes and she would
spray them with water as part of a gag.

53
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,120
With the last target,
Kim Jong Nam,

54
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,800
police believe the water
was secretly replaced with poison.

55
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,760
Holy shit. That is
a really harsh prank show.

56
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,440
You're dead
and you're a murderer ! I gotcha !

57
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,920
Actually, she got you, and we got
her, still: you're double pranked !

58
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,080
There is nothing that is not
fascinating about that story.

59
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,400
It didn't get
the attention it deserved.

60
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,000
The same is true of this story
you probably missed from Florida.

61
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,360
A Florida man behind bars

62
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,520
accused of plotting to blow up target
stores up and down the east coast.

63
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,000
According to the documents
the 48-year-old offered someone

64
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,160
10 000 dollars to put ten bombs
on the shelves inside Target stores,

65
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,920
warning not to let the boxes bounce
around or they would explode.

66
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,200
Barnett hoped the bombings would
send Target stock prices plummeting

67
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,200
so he could buy shares
on the cheap.

68
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,040
Magnificent. That story contains
homemade explosives,

69
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,360
a big store, an idiotic get-rich-quick
scheme and felony charges.

70
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,800
If it somehow also involved
a snake on meth,

71
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,360
you'd have full-on Florida bingo.

72
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,960
The stories don't stop there.
British Prime Minister Theresa May

73
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,920
went to see some children's
Lego robot creations

74
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,760
and this is the face she made.

75
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,240
If you're thinking:
"hold on that's unfair,"

76
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,680
"the camera caught
a split second there."

77
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,680
She also made this face
and then this face.

78
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,120
What is that ghastly
monstrosity, street rat ?

79
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,720
Did you create it
using your imagination ?

80
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,760
I thought we got rid of those
after we brexited. Scurry along rat !

81
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,400
In any other week, that face
would be the least diplomatic thing,

82
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,440
but this was also a week when Trump's
Ambassador to Somalia

83
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,200
presented that country's president
a hat: "Make Somalia Great Again"

84
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,720
and Trump took on the fraught
Israeli-Palestinian two-state solution

85
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,680
in the most casual possible way.

86
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,040
Looking at two-state and one-state and
I like the one that both parties like.

87
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,520
I'm very happy with the one
that both parties like.

88
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,240
If I may paraphrase
the people of Sweden for a second:

89
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,920
what the fuck
are you talking about ?

90
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,960
The people on each side who
want a one-state solution

91
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,320
generally cannot agree
on what state it should be.

92
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,200
No one's expecting them
to suddenly say:

93
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,080
"We agreed on one state
and it's Peru !"

94
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,880
"Shalom ! Salaam aleikum !
Welcome to Peru !"

95
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,440
But that is the problem: here we are,
talking about Trump again.

96
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,480
You cannot avoid him.
In the past week alone,

97
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,320
Trump designated the media
as enemies of the American people,

98
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,760
had his EPA-hating nominee
for head of the EPA confirmed,

99
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,000
lost his nominee for labor secretary
and his adviser,

100
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,520
signed a bill undoing Obama protection
for waterways from coal mining waste,

101
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,840
a signing that he capped off
with this wonderful gesture.

102
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,640
How about we give the pen
to the miners ?

103
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,720
That's perfect. Leave it to Trump
to give "seven people" one pen.

104
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,400
He must expect them to all share it,

105
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,400
like some kind of brotherhood
of the traveling pen.

106
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,680
That might be the laziest instance
of pen-gifting I've ever seen.

107
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,040
I'm including every other time
someone has given a pen as a gift.

108
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,440
Great. An expensive pen.
It's different than a regular pen

109
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,640
because I get to worry about losing it
and no other reasons.

110
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,000
Perhaps nothing summed up
Trump's week better

111
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,160
than his crazy press conference,

112
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,280
including this amazing exchange
with an African-American journalist.

113
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,040
Are you gonna include
the congressional black caucus...

114
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,680
I would. I tell you what: do
you want to set up the meeting ?

115
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,080
- No. I'm just a reporter.
- Are they friends of yours ?

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,560
The man is incredible.
What hits you first there

117
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,000
is the racism of assuming that
all black people are friends,

118
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,720
later you appreciate the sexism
of thinking all women are there

119
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,120
to perform secretarial tasks
for you.

120
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,840
The guy packs so much into so little.
His press conference was so unhinged

121
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,160
that many of the reporters
had the same initial response:

122
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,240
Yes, "wow". A presidential press
conference elicited the same reaction

123
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,440
you get from people who watched
someone shoot fireworks out of his ass.

124
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,520
Which when you think
about it is actually fitting.

125
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,120
When Trump speaks, what it is
essentially other than sparks, flames,

126
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,040
sputtering noisily
out of a damaged asshole.

127
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,800
And now, this.

128
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,800
Fox and Friends is painfully
aware of who is watching them.

129
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,880
I know Donald Trump is watching
and is up right now

130
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,920
so if you want us to check your
schedule, see if we have the same one.

131
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,320
Donald Trump watches this show,
tweet us this morning, let us know.

132
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,280
If he's watching, tweet us,
say we're going to Mars.

133
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,480
Donald Trump watches this show.

134
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,800
Trump watches every day,
like a groupie.

135
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,400
Trump probably
hasn't heard about it.

136
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,360
And we know that Donald Trump
watches this show,

137
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,560
so Donald, it's more than ISIS,
for example, Muslim Brotherhood.

138
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,280
Donald Trump is watching and
he doesn't love when you talk and eat.

139
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,640
I'll be very elegant.

140
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,440
I watched this morning,
and I have to say,

141
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,520
Fox & Friends in the morning,
they're very honorable people.

142
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,400
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns Russia.

143
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,600
The country that gave the world
Tetris, Merkins you wear on your heads

144
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,400
and potentially the 45th president
of the US.

145
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,720
Russia was at the center of a major
development in the US this week.

146
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,280
Michael Flynn resigning as
the US national security advisor.

147
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,880
This coming after reports that
the Justice Department warned

148
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,920
he could be vulnerable to blackmail

149
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,200
over communications he had
with the Russian Ambassador.

150
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,200
Check your office pools !
If you had "communication with Russia"

151
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,280
as the reason first member of Trump's
inner circle resigned, you win !

152
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,120
Shame, because my money was
on "never set foot in a public school"

153
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,920
or "President can't stop seeing
Melissa McCarthy when you speak".

154
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,040
But the Flynn debacle is just
the tip of the iceberg

155
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,600
regarding Trump Administration
and Russia.

156
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,560
Accusations swirling around
people in his campaign,

157
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,360
Paul Manafort and Carter Page,

158
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,560
evidence that Russia hacked the DNC's
emails to influence the election

159
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,640
and the infamous leaked dossier
alleging serious connections

160
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,440
between Trump and his associates
and Russia,

161
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,320
or as you remember it: "the thing about
the urine-fetish Moscow sex party".

162
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,840
There is no hard proof yet of direct
links between Trump and Russia.

163
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:01,400
But, he does have a weird, soft spot
for both the country and its leader.

164
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,360
I was in Moscow recently
and I spoke indirectly and directly

165
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,520
with President Putin,
who could not have been nicer.

166
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,560
Putin even sent me a present,
with a beautiful note.

167
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,240
It would be great if we could
get along with Russia.

168
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:24,160
You'll say: "Trump wants to get along
with Russia, this is terrible."

169
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,120
It's not terrible. It's good.

170
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,640
I'm not saying it's terrible
but I'm saying it's a bit weird.

171
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,040
You've being nicer to Vladimir Putin
than you have to Meryl Streep.

172
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,920
Who,
I'm sure is not an infamous autocrat

173
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,640
although if she tried it, she'd nail
it, the woman is the tour de force.

174
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:52,200
But the point is, Trump is fixated
on getting along better with Russia,

175
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,600
so tonight we thought we'd ask
what does that actually mean ?

176
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,000
What are the chances
of it happening

177
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,320
and what might we give up
in the process.

178
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,360
Here we think of Putin
as a cartoon character

179
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,320
who stages photo ops
where he's shirtless on a horse,

180
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,120
or swimming like a dolphin, emerging
from the sea like a Bond villain,

181
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,880
or winning a staring contest
with a baby chick,

182
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,680
or quite possibly
breaking a child's arm.

183
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,800
In Russia, he's not comic-book villain.
To many, he's a comic-book hero.

184
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,040
He is genuinely popular there.
For years, he's had his own pop song.

185
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,680
I want a man like Putin,
who's full of strength.

186
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,080
I want a man like Putin,
who doesn't drink.

187
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,400
I want a man like Putin,
who won't make me sad.

188
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,600
I want a man like Putin,
who won't run away.

189
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,800
That song has been stuck in my head
all week, I don't even speak Russian !

190
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,160
It's called "A Man Like Putin"

191
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,480
and it's all about how women
want someone like him.

192
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,160
That means they want a man
in his 60s, who has thinning hair

193
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,360
and who's probably about
5 foot 5.

194
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,680
The man they're saying they want is
essentially Richard Dreyfuss, but mean.

195
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,680
As for all those photo ops,
you'd be surprised how many Russians

196
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,000
look at those
and take them at face value.

197
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,480
Earlier this year Putin miraculously
recovered two ancient vases

198
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,160
from the bottom of the ocean.

199
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,080
Fortunately cameras were on hand
to capture this historic moment.

200
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,640
Lots of people go diving
and find nothing.

201
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:38,040
It is amazing that Putin found it.
It is a sign.

202
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,640
It's not a coincidence.
It's very significant.

203
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,320
Come on.
Not only is that clearly bullshit,

204
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,160
but contrived seaside photo ops
is the same publicity strategy

205
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,320
as Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston.

206
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:58,120
America had Hiddleswift. Russia
got Putlejug. Hashtag "putlejug".

207
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,560
Putin's popularity
is more surprising given that

208
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,200
his presidency has been shrouded
in accusations of corruption.

209
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,240
We have seen him enriching
his friends, his close allies.

210
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:17,440
And marginalizing those who he doesn't
view as friends using state assets,

211
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,040
whether that's Russia's energy wealth,
other state contracts,

212
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,240
he directs those to whom
he believes will serve him

213
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,640
and excludes those who don't.

214
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,800
I see. So Putin's friends depend
on him for their wealth.

215
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,640
That explains how he wound up once
going out dressed like this,

216
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,200
because any real friend
would tell him:

217
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,320
"Vladimir, I love you, but you cannot
pull off white denim."

218
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,680
You look like you're attending
the wedding of a yacht in 1991.

219
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,120
As a friend, get changed.

220
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,000
It's not just Putin's friends
who've become rich,

221
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,600
some estimates put Putin's personal
wealth anywhere from $40 to $85 billion

222
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,720
which would make him one
of the richest men in the world.

223
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,880
Although he strenuously denies it,
nothing about his finances adds up.

224
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,280
President Putin's official income
is around $100 000 a year,

225
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,800
and yet he lives like the super rich.

226
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,640
He has a collection
of expensive watches,

227
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,640
even his designer tracksuit
costs three thousand dollars.

228
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,680
What monster works out
in a $3000 tracksuit ?

229
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,000
The only acceptable reason
for owning a tracksuit that expensive

230
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,480
is if you recorded the 2002 hit
"Work It",

231
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,280
your name is Missy Elliott, and you are
not aware that other clothes exist.

232
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,520
That is it. I draw a line there.

233
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,320
For example of surprising wealth,
consider Putin's daughter.

234
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,720
She and her husband have
holdings worth around $2 billion,

235
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,000
which is a lot of money,
for someone who

236
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,600
is an academic-acrobatic
rock-and-roll dancer.

237
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,840
If you think we don't have footage
of her in action, you are mistaken.

238
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,240
First: cool.
And second...

239
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,640
A lot of people think
the most dangerous job in the world

240
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,000
is prison guard or fighter pilot,
but I'd like to put in a word for

241
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,680
"guy whose job is to throw Putin's
daughter way up in the air"

242
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,800
"and then hopefully catch her."

243
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,040
Maybe Vladimir Putin has just been
extraordinarily lucky in his life.

244
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,800
If so, it contrasts with the extreme
misfortune many of his critics

245
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,600
and opponents have suffered.

246
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,320
Opposition leader Boris Nemtsov
was shot dead.

247
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,400
Litvinenko, a former KGB
agent who turned on Putin,

248
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,240
died of radiation poisoning.

249
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,080
Journalist Anna Politkovskaya
was murdered on Putin's birthday.

250
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,440
The activist Vladimir Karamurza
was allegedly poisoned,

251
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,160
survived, only to be allegedly
poisoned again earlier this year.

252
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,200
This looks bad. But, again: maybe Putin
had nothing to do with any of that

253
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,200
and just got lucky,
maybe the guy has a rabbit's foot.

254
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,200
A freshly severed one,
but still, he's got one.

255
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,040
Other Putin adversaries
have a ended up disgraced

256
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,040
when sex tapes of them were
shown on TV or on the Internet.

257
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,880
A sex tape doesn't even need to be
real, as this man, Kyle Hatcher,

258
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,200
worked for the US state department
in Russia, discovered.

259
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:41,080
This undercover video of Hatcher
was posted on a Russian site

260
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,280
complete with background music.

261
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,080
Hatcher is seen in a Moscow
hotel room in his underwear,

262
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,880
then the lights are out in the room,

263
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,720
and a man and a woman appear to be
having sexual relations on the bed.

264
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,760
Hatcher told US officials
this is a fabrication.

265
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,000
That is obviously ridiculous.
But I do have some questions:

266
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,560
if someone releases a fake sex tape
of you, do you watch it ?

267
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,280
What if the fake you is better
at sex than the real you ?

268
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,880
I'm currently talking shit
about Putin on television,

269
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,560
so I'm expecting my fake sex tape
to come out any moment now.

270
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,080
I'm just interested, that's all.

271
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,800
Putin created an atmosphere in Russia
hostile to any oppositions.

272
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,320
Standing up to him can mean being
targeted by trolls, not just on-line.

273
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,920
When Garry Kasparov spoke at
a political opposition event,

274
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,160
he was interrupted
by radio-controlled flying dildos.

275
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,120
I have to say:
I kind of respect that deep down.

276
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,520
That takes real imagination,
initiative and planning.

277
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:57,320
What is less impressive, is what
Ilya Yashin claims happened to him.

278
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,280
I never expected this.

279
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,240
One after the other,
without being ashamed,

280
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,000
two thugs get onto the bonnet
of my car and take a dump.

281
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,240
Just imagine: the center of Moscow.
Children and their parents passing by.

282
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,840
I do understand being mad at someone
who has shit on your car,

283
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,200
but parents walking by
are not going to be offended.

284
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:36,720
Your response to seeing someone other
than your own kid take a dump in public

285
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,280
is "not my fucking problem."

286
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,280
Putin may or may not have
stolen billions of dollars,

287
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,400
may or may not have been involved
in the intimidation of his opponents.

288
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,080
There is so much that people suspect,
but can't quite prove.

289
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,120
In the same way that I suspect

290
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,120
Putin's genitals are just
a fist covered in thorns,

291
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,640
but I can't entirely say for sure.

292
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,920
I'm 98%,
I'm just not quite there.

293
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,280
But here is what we can say
about Putin without a doubt.

294
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,000
He annexed Crimea, imposed severe
fines and prison terms on protestors,

295
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,960
propped up the brutal Assad regime,
signed a harsh anti-gay propaganda law,

296
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,680
which many Russians supported,
which might not be that surprising

297
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,800
when you see shit like this
on state-sponsored TV.

298
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,240
Sodom and Gomorrah were burnt
with the rain of sulphurous fire.

299
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,920
Since that time, the real name of
homosexuals, just so you know,

300
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,600
is not gays, but sodomites.

301
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,640
God does not tolerate the filth and sin
that may consume the entire world.

302
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,200
We need to resist to stay alive.

303
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,120
Now, to give you just a sense
of just how anti-gay Russian TV is,

304
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,080
their most popular makeover show
features five straight guys

305
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,400
and is called
"That Jacket Looks Fine".

306
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,480
That is Russia under Vladimir Putin.

307
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,480
Our president wants
to get along better with him.

308
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,400
I'm not saying America
hasn't cozied up

309
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,040
to regimes
with hideous human rights records.

310
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,040
I will not mention names, but
Saudi Arabia knows who they are.

311
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,680
There is something alarming about how
easy Trump makes this all sound.

312
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,760
If our country got along with Russia,
that would be a great thing.

313
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,720
Wouldn't it be a wonderful thing,
if we got along with Russia ?

314
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,960
Wouldn't it be great if
we got along with Russia ?

315
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,040
Wouldn't it be nice
if we got along with Russia ?

316
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,640
Wouldn't it be wonderful ?
Wouldn't it be nice ?

317
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,560
Wouldn't it be nice if we got along
as an example with Russia.

318
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,720
It would also be nice if you could
walk right up to a bear and hug it.

319
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,480
That would be really nice.
But unfortunately, it's not that easy.

320
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,040
Negotiating anything with Putin
is going to be way more difficult

321
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,680
than Trump seems to think.

322
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,200
Putin spent his early life as a spy
for Russia in East Germany,

323
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,840
where he mastered
manipulating foreigners.

324
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,720
I'm not saying that Trump
isn't at his level.

325
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,840
Watch what happened last year,
when Bill O'Reilly tried to game out

326
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,440
how Trump would respond to Russian
planes buzzing US warships.

327
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,560
I would say: "Do not do that.
That's provocation."

328
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:31,120
Right. But if he did, you would have
to shoot one of those planes down.

329
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,560
I may have to do something which
you would hate to do.

330
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,240
But this is something
I wouldn't want to do.

331
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,720
I would say: "Vladimir, don't do it.
Let's go. Come on."

332
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,760
We're gonna have
a good relationship. Don't do it.

333
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,640
That is embarrassing.
He is using the tone of a dog owner

334
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,360
failing to stop a spaniel
peeing on the rug:

335
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,000
"Waggles, don't do it.
Let's go. Come on, Waggles."

336
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,880
"We're gonna have a good relationship.
Don't do it, Wags. Don't do it."

337
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,880
Trump has already given Putin
something absolutely massive

338
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,200
and he may not even realize it yet.

339
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,880
Putin is actually a little bit weaker
than you think at the moment.

340
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,520
His economy is struggling,
not great news for an autocrat

341
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,360
who may have stolen billions
from his own people.

342
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,160
But he is still very popular,

343
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,800
in part because he deflects criticism
onto the US.

344
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,680
Not just to dodge blame,
but to delegitimize our ability

345
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,520
to claim the moral high ground.

346
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,240
Russians love it when America
points a finger at him,

347
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,240
and he points it right back.

348
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,000
When he was asked about suppressing
dissent in Russia,

349
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,080
he changed the subject
to problems in America.

350
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,400
You believe that everything is perfect
from the point of view of democracy ?

351
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,320
If everything was perfect, there
would be no problem like Ferguson.

352
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,560
There would be no other problems
of a similar nature.

353
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,720
There would be
no abuse by the police.

354
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,800
This is the same case in Russia,
a lot of problems.

355
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,280
Yeah, but not all problems
are the same.

356
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,920
It's like comparing "La La Land",
an Academy Award nominated movie,

357
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,760
to "The Human Centipede",
a thing that barely counts as a film.

358
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,080
Yes, one movie is people
sewn mouth-to-anus,

359
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,880
but Ryan Gosling looks at his feet
when he dances, so it all evens out.

360
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:34,480
This message: "if things are bad here,
know they're just as bad in America"

361
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,600
that is a key Putin technique.

362
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,160
Russian state media spent a good part
of last year insisting

363
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,040
that the US election was rigged
and they did this for a clear reason.

364
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,720
What does the Kremlin
want to put in Russians' heads ?

365
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,160
There is no real democracy
in the world.

366
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:56,640
This will be the opportunity to show
that they do the same thing.

367
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,600
- We're no worse than they are.
- Yes, exactly.

368
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,560
So that is the official line: "you're
shit, we're shit, everything's shit."

369
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,800
"Never try for a better world
because it doesn't exist."

370
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,440
I think it's also the working title
of every Russian novel ever written.

371
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,400
You would expect "America's elections
are rigged" to be standard Putin line.

372
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,200
What changed last year though

373
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,480
was that he had a major American
candidate saying the same thing.

374
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,720
And if you think that
that played into Putin's hands,

375
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,880
imagine how happy he was to then
see the president of the US

376
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,160
take his moral equivalence
argument and just run with it.

377
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,760
Putin's a killer.

378
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:46,000
We've got a lot of killers.
You think our country's so innocent ?

379
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,160
I don't know government
leaders that are killers in America.

380
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,200
Take a look
at what we've done, too.

381
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,560
Holy shit.

382
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,240
The only way he could sound
any more like Vladimir Putin

383
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,720
is if he said all that
in a fucking $3000 tracksuit.

384
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,480
Trump is basically the propagandist
of Putin's dreams.

385
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,560
Who knows
why he's acting this way ?

386
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,280
Maybe he's compromised.
Maybe he's an idiot.

387
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,480
Since the president of the US won't
stick up for this country, I will:

388
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,840
America and Russia are not
the fucking same.

389
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:24,880
America has had and continues to have
endemic problems that need fixing.

390
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,440
That might as well be
the title of this show.

391
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:34,080
But hold on. 'Cause our elections
have flaws, but they are not rigged.

392
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,880
Our human rights record
is far from perfect,

393
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,320
but it does not compare
to Putin's Russia.

394
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,360
Our press is at least currently free
enough that I can routinely do this.

395
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,040
Donald Trump,
America's wealthiest hemorrhoid.

396
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,400
America's walking,
talking brush fire.

397
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,080
Rome burning in man form.

398
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,960
An suit full of
chickens coming home to roost.

399
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,040
Twitter's id made manifest.
This sentient circus peanut.

400
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,800
A racist voodoo doll made
of discarded cat hair.

401
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,800
A clown made of mummified foreskin
and cotton candy.

402
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,000
A piece of candy corn in a wig
made of used medical gauze.

403
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,160
A bag with cheeseburgers
and confederate belt buckles.

404
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,360
A luggage
covered in Cheez Whiz.

405
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,480
A kidney on the floor
at a Super Cuts.

406
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,280
He is what happens if
The Secret gets into the wrong hands.

407
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,040
Yeah, I've talked a lot of shit.

408
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:28,000
And to his credit, Trump
has not had me murdered. Yet.

409
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:33,440
There is still time. Trump has
already given Putin a lot,

410
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,960
without realizing it,
but Putin wants more.

411
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,160
Experts say that he likely wants
an end to US sanctions,

412
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,040
for us to endorse
his pro-Assad position in Syria,

413
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,480
and to let him weaken NATO, and to
recognize his annexation of Crimea.

414
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,960
All of which would be against
American interests and values.

415
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:56,480
If unchecked, Trump may trade any
or all of that away in exchange

416
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,600
for "getting along better",
whatever the fuck that means.

417
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,200
So someone needs quickly
to get into Trump's ear

418
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,640
and educate him in how realistic
getting along better with Putin is.

419
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,880
Our Catheter Cowboy
cannot do it in thirty seconds.

420
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,840
We've put together an explanation
guaranteed to stick in Trump's mind,

421
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,280
in the catchiest possible
form: shitty techno music.

422
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,200
A man like Putin may seem
like he's strong,

423
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,440
But if you think that,
know that you're wrong.

424
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,720
A man like Putin sure has good luck

425
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,960
Because journalists die,
and he's rich as fuck.

426
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,480
A man like Putin only wants power.

427
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,880
He'll fake a tape
of your golden shower.

428
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:50,320
That's not something we want to see,
your orangey face all covered in pee.

429
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,200
And critics like Oliver better run far,
because he'll track you down,

430
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,920
And he'll shit on your car.

431
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,440
No ! Do not shit on my car !
That is weird. It's so weird.

432
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,920
If anything it might be the
weirdest part of this whole story.

433
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,320
Don't shit on my car.
Please, don't do it.

434
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,440
Sorry, you were telling
the president about Putin. Go.

435
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,520
Beware of Putin,
he's ruthless and shrewd.

436
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,960
If you're not careful,
we'll all end up screwed.

437
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:29,640
A man like Putin is really bad,
that you need that explained is so sad.

438
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,960
That's our show,
thank you so much for watching.

439
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,320
We'll see you next week,
good night !

440
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,200
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

441
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,320
END OF EPISODE 2,
SEASON IV
