00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,280
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,200
SEASON IV
EPISODE 10

3
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,200
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,920
Thank you for joining us.
A quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,920
We begin with: "a narcissistic,
unstable man who might kill us all."

6
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,000
It says something about
the state of the world

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,440
that you have no idea which
world leader our story is about.

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,800
A tubby, powerhungry leader with
daddy issues and a bad haircut.

9
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,680
Which still only narrows us
down to these two.

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,520
Our first story
is about both of them.

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,520
North Korea marked
the 105th birthday of Kim Il-sung,

12
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,200
their first supreme leader,
with a parade.

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,560
These canisters could carry
a missile capable of reaching the US,

14
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,480
but are they real, or are they
what one intelligence official called

15
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,520
just big green tubes ?

16
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:25,160
That is a good question. They
could be intercontinental missiles,

17
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,000
capable of destabilizing
the whole world order.

18
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,360
They could also be dildos
for the Jolly Green Giant's wife.

19
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,640
He does not sexually satisfy her.
That's a sad fact.

20
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,640
The parade wasn't the issue
for the international community,

21
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,640
but the missile test that followed it,
the fifth in the past ten weeks.

22
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,120
While it failed,
it was a provocative act,

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,720
especially considering Trump had
tried to warn them not to do it.

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,160
What are we doing right now,
in terms of North Korea ?

25
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,760
We are sending an armada,
very powerful.

26
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,920
We have submarines,
very powerful.

27
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:08,040
That was a very powerful response
from Trump. Very powerful.

28
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,000
The most surprising thing is that he
knows what the word "armada" means.

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,680
I assumed that's what he mistakenly
called his housekeepers.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,440
Armada, you forgot
to dust under the lamps.

31
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,280
You think I don't check under
the lamps, but I do.

32
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,000
I do check under the lamps.

33
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,840
To give the president
some credit:

34
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,400
that was at least a clear response
echoed later by Sean Spicer,

35
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,520
who argued there was
a message of deterrence being sent

36
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,080
"when you see a carrier group
steaming into an area like that."

37
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,080
That message got muddied,

38
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,480
after we learned something
about that carrier group.

39
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,040
The 'USS Carl Vinson' was not,
in fact, on its way.

40
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,640
It was more than
3 000 nautical miles away,

41
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,600
traveling in the opposite direction,
heading south.

42
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,680
So it was steaming,
just the wrong way.

43
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,920
It was off the coast
of North Korea the same way

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,360
that New York
is off the coast of Portugal.

45
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,960
When confronted, Sean Spicer,
a professional spokesperson,

46
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,480
yet again
lost control of his mouth.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,080
Can you take us through the events
from the perspective of the White House

48
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,200
this administration thinking
that this vessel was

49
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,120
thousands of miles away
from its actual location ?

50
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,640
President said we have
an armada going towards the peninsula.

51
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,920
That's a fact.
It is happening, rather.

52
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,000
Wait. So, Spicer is claiming that,

53
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,280
because the fleet was
going to North Korea "eventually",

54
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,000
it was fine to suggest
it was on its way there now.

55
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,080
And by that logic,
I can truthfully say that Sean Spicer

56
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,920
is currently posting
his resume on monster.com.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,960
He isn't, but he will eventually,
possibly as soon as next week.

58
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,800
With the parade of potentially fake
weapons, the failed missile test

59
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,640
and the armada that's "definitely"
in an ocean steaming somewhere,

60
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,680
it has been a week of confusing
messages back and forth.

61
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,560
On Wednesday, we got
the most surprising message.

62
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,360
The New York Times reports
on unusual activity

63
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,520
at North Korea's nuclear test site.

64
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,800
Images taken Sunday showed
a volleyball game being played.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,560
Analysts say the games were intended
to send a message, but is unclear.

66
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,640
Volleyball on a nuclear test site

67
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,400
is a pretty hard message
to get your head around.

68
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,440
It's like getting a text that said:
"hey you up, eggplant emoji,"

69
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,640
"I just ate an entire box of graham
crackers, gun emoji."

70
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,080
I don't know what that means,
but it can't be good.

71
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,920
Let's move on to Turkey: a country
that shares its name with a bird.

72
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,440
And not just any bird.
The "hottest" bird.

73
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,840
Lookin' good, my friend,
lookin' good.

74
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,000
We've talked before about
President Recep Erdogan,

75
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,800
who once got hoof-punched
in the dick by a horse.

76
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,480
He has been attempting
to consolidate his power for years

77
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,240
and last Sunday,
he took his boldest step yet.

78
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,040
President Erdogan declared victory

79
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,000
in a referendum that gives him
sweeping new powers.

80
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,440
His critics say this is a step
towards dictatorship.

81
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,240
I can now add Turkey to my list
of things to worry about,

82
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,800
along with America,
the French election

83
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,240
and whether John Cena is
having a happy 40th birthday today.

84
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,680
How the fuck John Cena and I
are the exact same age ?

85
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,800
My God.
That is heartbreaking.

86
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:39,000
The power this referendum
gives Erdogan is sweeping:

87
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,000
Erdogan now has broad unchecked
powers and the authority

88
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,760
to potentially remain
in office until 2029.

89
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,880
The referendum gives Erdogan
the power to do pretty much everything

90
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,960
short of building a statue of himself
with an erection

91
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,200
that citizens will be forced
to give pretend handjobs to.

92
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,080
It might have given him
the power to do that as well.

93
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,120
Legitimacy of the results
were called into question

94
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,560
after reports of voting irregularities.

95
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,760
European observers
criticized the referendum, saying

96
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,360
it "took place on
an un-level playing field",

97
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,800
something that Erdogan
did not take well.

98
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,720
"What George, Hans, or Helga say,
that's not our problem," Erdogan said,

99
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,240
mocking European election
monitors questioning the results.

100
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,880
That is dismissive. Especially
since "George, Hans & Helga"

101
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,840
sounds like a former East German
folk-rock group:

102
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,600
We are George, Hans und Helga.
Prepare for sound of peace and love

103
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,320
administered promptly into
your ears and brains, mein Freunde.

104
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,480
But this really does put America
in a tricky situation:

105
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,200
Turkey is a critical ally,

106
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,440
so any reaction to this referendum
needed to be handled delicately.

107
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,800
Sean Spicer refused to issue
a comment on the contested results.

108
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,880
There's an international commission
reviewing this and issues a report,

109
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,280
so ten to twelve days and
we'll let them do their job.

110
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,440
Build the administration time,
don't jump into the situation

111
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,040
without thinking through
the complicated ripple effec...

112
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,240
You all know
what's coming now, right ?

113
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,200
U.S. President Donald Trump
has called Turkish President

114
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,560
to congratulate him on
his narrow referendum triumph.

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,160
That happened the same day.

116
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,560
I guess at least
it would've been a fun call.

117
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,320
Congratulations on winning
a vote that made you,

118
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,720
a egomaniacal bully,
enormously powerful in your country !

119
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,240
Thanks ! Same to you, Donald !
Thanks ! Aren't we the worst ?

120
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,200
We are the worst ! Goodbye !

121
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:50,160
Why is Trump so eager
to stay on Erdogan's good side ?

122
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,160
One explanation for that
comes from Trump himself,

123
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,080
in this interview that he gave
to Breitbart in 2015.

124
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,840
I have a little conflict of interest,
I have a major building in Istanbul.

125
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,320
It's a tremendously successful job.
It's called Trump Towers.

126
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,520
Two towers, instead of one.
Not the usual one, it's two.

127
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,880
Of course to everything
you just heard.

128
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,640
There's a conflict of interest.
Of course it's caught on tape.

129
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,320
Of course he pronounces it
Istan-bool.

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,680
Of course he has a childlike surprise
that towers can come in twos.

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,120
Between his actions regarding
North Korea and Turkey,

132
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,400
world war three is beginning
to feel like Trump's armada.

133
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,200
It's not here yet, but it sure as
shit feels like it's on its way.

134
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,960
And now this.

135
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,840
And now, cable news.

136
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,000
It is a violation of the emoluments
clause of the constitution,

137
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,160
the remedy for which is impeachment,
somebody tell me where that's wrong.

138
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,960
You're talking over each other,
I can't hear you. Go ahead, Senator.

139
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,120
How it works.

140
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,680
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns the White House.

141
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,720
The building inside which Trump
and I feel this isn't mentioned enough

142
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,040
is regularly naked.

143
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,480
Think about that: he might be naked
in there right now.

144
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,640
Maybe he just sneezed. Maybe there's
a Band-Aid somewhere on his person.

145
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,920
We just know that he's there
and we all have to live with that.

146
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,960
While Trump is divisive,
there are two White House figures

147
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,040
widely admired:
Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.

148
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,000
America's William and Kate,

149
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,880
except in this case
"both" of them are attractive.

150
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,760
Many people
have praise for them.

151
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,960
The only adults in the room,
the moderates, the centrists,

152
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,880
frankly Democrats,
are Jared and Ivanka.

153
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,080
Thank god his kids are there.
They're a positive influence on him.

154
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,360
His best running mate
would be Ivanka.

155
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,720
I don't know I've met a more
composed, brilliant,

156
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,040
beautiful in every way, person.

157
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,480
Well that is high praise
from Senator Bob Corker:

158
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,240
"Never met a more brilliant,
beautiful person."

159
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,760
I imagine that went down great
with his wife and two daughters.

160
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,240
Happy father's day, dad.
Did Ivanka send you anything ?

161
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,160
But for liberals,
the popular assumption is

162
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,240
that Jared and Ivanka
will be moderating influences.

163
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,040
If Trump is thinking about pressing
a button labeled "nuke earth",

164
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,800
they will, on behalf of all of us,
guide his hand

165
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,640
towards the button labeled
"hey... maybe don't".

166
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,640
They both have
official roles now.

167
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,640
Ivanka has taken an unpaid position
as "Assistant to the President".

168
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,040
Jared seems to have a hand
in basically everything.

169
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,840
He's been planning this week's visit
of the Chinese president to Mar-a-Lago

170
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,800
and brokering
peace in the Middle East.

171
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,240
The president tapping his son-in-law
to reform the criminal justice system,

172
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,960
not to mention he's running
the new office of American innovation

173
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,920
where he's responsible
for reforming veteran care,

174
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,080
tackling the opioid epidemic
and overseeing the not so small feat

175
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,080
of revamping
the federal government.

176
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,240
Holy shit.

177
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,320
It is not unusual for powerful men to
give their son-in-laws do-nothing jobs.

178
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,080
But leave it to Donald Trump,
who can't even get nepotism right,

179
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,440
to give his a do-everything job.

180
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,280
Given the power they seem to hold,
let's take a look at Jared and Ivanka.

181
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,800
Set aside the questions surrounding
potential conflicts of interest

182
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,000
and let's focus on answering
just two basic questions.

183
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,520
Is Ivanka really the moderating
influence people claim ?

184
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,640
What in Jared's background justifies
such a gigantic White House portfolio ?

185
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,840
Let's start with Ivanka.
Trump's only daughter,

186
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,840
except for, and yet somehow
including, Tiffany.

187
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,520
Ivanka is reassuringly familiar,

188
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,680
she's been part of the Trump brand
since she was a child.

189
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,520
She even co-hosted Trump's
"Miss Teen USA" pageant at age 15,

190
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,640
featuring this
noticeably odd moment.

191
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,720
Let's go back to Ivanka !

192
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,720
I guarantee my brothers were loving
that. Are any of you up there single ?

193
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,120
God. Why did they
have her say that ?

194
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,320
Yes, Eddie: my blood relatives
are rock hard right now.

195
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,560
The men with whom I share
parents probably have erect penises !

196
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,400
In the public drama
of the Trump family,

197
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,640
Ivanka has been cast as the calm,
reasonable, indoor-voiced one,

198
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,000
a dynamic that's perhaps
best exemplified by this moment.

199
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,680
What's the favorite thing you have
in common with your father ?

200
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,040
- Either real estate or golf.
- Donald ? With your daughter ?

201
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,440
I was going to say sex,
but I can't relate that to her.

202
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,320
What is wrong with you,
you colossal fucking creep ?

203
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,440
You found the only possible
wrong answer to that question !

204
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,320
What's your favorite color ?
Hitler.

205
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:03,000
That clip actually illustrates a lot
of what we like about Ivanka:

206
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,240
she's the opposite of her dad.

207
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,240
He's crazy,
she's poised and restrained.

208
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,520
She is impressively on-message.

209
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,840
Think about how little information
gave in that exchange.

210
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,960
She was asked: "what do you have
in common with your dad ?"

211
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,160
and she said:
"real estate and golf".

212
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,600
Those are not personal details,
they are core components

213
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,120
of the Trump brand that any stranger
would associate with him.

214
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,000
If you asked Huey, Duey and Louie
what they had in common with Donald

215
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,680
and they said:
"either feathers or no pants",

216
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,200
you would think: "Duck family doesn't
spend a lot of quality time together."

217
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,240
That ability to apparently say nothing
and yet support her dad,

218
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,840
can apply to her political views.

219
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,080
The assumption that she disagrees with
him isn't actually based on much.

220
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,240
Watch her response to being questioned
about what they disagree on.

221
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,240
My father agrees with me
on so many issues.

222
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,920
And where he doesn't,
he knows where I stand.

223
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,360
Give us an example of something
that you disagree with him on

224
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,960
and by speaking up it made him
change or soften his position !

225
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,160
Most of the impact I have,

226
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,880
over time, most people
will not actually know about.

227
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,000
That's convenient !

228
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,760
Give her credit
when good stuff happens

229
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,200
and blame others
when bad stuff happens.

230
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,200
That's not a job description
of a political adviser,

231
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,840
that's a description
of an Old Testament God.

232
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,480
That answer there enables you
to project whatever you want onto her,

233
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,120
based on second-hand rumors
and assumptions.

234
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,400
Which is exactly what
Gayle King and her co-hosts then did.

235
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,920
What is it they differ on
and where do you think she has...

236
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,880
She is not gonna share that
information, with me anyway.

237
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,120
- That's between her and her dad.
- But what do you think ?

238
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,520
I think about climate change, gay
rights, some of the immigration ban.

239
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,000
- Planned Parenthood.
- Certainly.

240
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,480
Certainly Planned Parenthood
as well, why not ?

241
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,480
Those things all feel true,
but there is not a lot of evidence.

242
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,600
The same way
that I assume Johnny Depp's penis

243
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,080
also has its own miniature hat
and goatee.

244
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,360
I don't have any concrete evidence.

245
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,600
But c'mon... Probably, right ?

246
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,600
Looking at what the Trump
administration has been doing,

247
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,440
it is hard to see much
of Ivanka's influence there.

248
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,920
Take Planned Parenthood,
which she certainly cares about.

249
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,960
Donald Trump allowed
states to block funds to it.

250
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,680
Or maybe take climate change.
Ivanka bring Al Gore to Trump Tower.

251
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,040
Three days later, Trump named
climate change denialist Scott Pruitt

252
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,280
to head the EPA.

253
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,200
Maybe that is an example of
Ivanka's moderating influence.

254
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,160
Maybe Trump's initial choice
was a guy strangling a dolphin.

255
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,920
Let's look at an issue that Ivanka
has been very outspoken about:

256
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,800
last year at the RNC, she brought up
family leave and child care.

257
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,000
When the campaign released
their plan, she sold it hard.

258
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,800
We've proposed something
incredibly comprehensive,

259
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,360
it's very innovative,
it's a bold and fresh solution.

260
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,320
There's no policy
on Hillary Clinton's website

261
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:31,800
pertaining childcare, elder care
or maternity or paternity leave.

262
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,640
Except none of that was true.

263
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,280
First, of course Hillary's site
had pages on those issues.

264
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,400
When it comes
to lying about easily observable facts,

265
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,840
the apple does not fall
far from the orange.

266
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:51,640
Let's look at that comprehensive,
bold fresh Trump child-care proposal.

267
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,760
According to the Tax Policy Center,

268
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,280
"very few of its benefits went
to the lowest income families."

269
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,320
Families with incomes
between 10 and $30 000

270
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,000
would receive average benefits
of just $10 a year.

271
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,600
And the only daycare that
costs ten dollars is a padlock.

272
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,160
Mommy's going to work and
Mrs. Masterlock is going to keep you

273
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,520
in your bedroom
for the next eight hours.

274
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,520
Thanks, Ivanka !
You're the best !

275
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,800
You may still like Ivanka.
That's fine.

276
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,120
She can be appealing and that's,
frankly, not by accident.

277
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,640
She's been trained to be as vague
and likable as possible

278
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,040
so that everyone can plausibly think
that she shares their values,

279
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,160
whether or not that's true.

280
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,600
And if that sounds like a harsh thing
for me to say about her,

281
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,120
she's basically shared that
message in one of her books.

282
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,240
Perception is more important
than reality.

283
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,040
If someone perceives
something to be true,

284
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,960
it is more important
than if it is in fact true.

285
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,520
Doesn't mean you should be
duplicitous or deceitful,

286
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,400
but don't correct a false assumption
if it plays to your advantage.

287
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,320
She's pretty much telling you

288
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,960
not to trust any assumption
that you are making about her.

289
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,320
So it is possible that she is doing
nothing to moderate her father.

290
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,440
I understand that there is an impulse
not to want to think about that.

291
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,480
Like you don't want to think about
the fact that it is also possible that,

292
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,920
in the White House right now,
her father may be bowling naked.

293
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,800
Maybe he's wearing
bowling shoes.

294
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,880
Maybe he's forcing Mike Pence
to play alongside him.

295
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,400
We just have to deal
with the fact that it's possible.

296
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,640
We all may be thinking that Ivanka
is doing more than she actually is.

297
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,240
The same can emphatically not be said
for her husband, Jared Kushner.

298
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,400
The man responsible for, among
others, repairing the Middle East,

299
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,720
something that his father-in-law
is pretty confident in.

300
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,000
I have a feeling
that Jared is gonna do a great job,

301
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,000
he's gonna do a great job.

302
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,080
He is so great. If you can't produce
peace in the Middle East, nobody can.

303
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,120
Then nobody can.

304
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,440
Or I am wrong and future history
books will say:

305
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,200
"peace was finally brought
to the Middle East"

306
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,160
"by a sentient Kohl's mannequin
who read a book once."

307
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,000
Jared has more responsibility.
He's also reportedly been

308
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,720
the primary point of contact
for two dozen different countries.

309
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,240
If you look at Trump's meetings,
it's like "Where's Waldo ?":

310
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,560
he's in all of them.

311
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,760
When Trump met the leaders
of Congress, there he was.

312
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,960
Listening session with
business leaders, there he was.

313
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,560
At a meeting on cyber security,
there he was.

314
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,280
At a meeting with a Saudi prince,
there's Jared.

315
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,640
Japanese prime minister ?
It's J-Dog.

316
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,200
Chinese president visiting ?
You got Kushner in the house.

317
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,600
Discussing the airstrikes on Syria,
where's the Kush ?

318
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,720
There he is !
There's the Kush !

319
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,320
Jared is either being invited
to every important meeting

320
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,440
or he died in the White House
in the late 1800's

321
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,520
and he's been haunting it
ever since.

322
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,160
His portfolio would be unmanageable
for the smartest man on Earth.

323
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,400
So: is Jared Kushner
the smartest man on Earth ?

324
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,640
We already know
he's the coolest,

325
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,600
he can really rock
a trill pair of sunnies,

326
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,400
but what is going on behind them ?

327
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,480
This guy can be quiet but confident
and he is a visionary.

328
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,200
If you have meetings with Jared,
Jared listens,

329
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,520
he doesn't talk that much,
he absorbs it.

330
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,600
I see Jared as like the Alexander
Hamilton of the new administration.

331
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,160
He's super thoughtful.

332
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,680
He's a three-times listener,
0.5 percent talker.

333
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,680
Stop. So he is brilliant
because he's quiet ?

334
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,360
Just because you don't talk,

335
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,200
does not mean
you are thinking something amazing.

336
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,200
It can mean that you're sitting
in a meeting, staring at people's lips,

337
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,360
thinking about why baby cats
aren't called "cattens",

338
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,880
or whether all goldfish
might have peanut allergies

339
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,320
but since they don't ever eat
peanuts, we'll just never know.

340
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,880
That point-five percent talker thing
point to something odd about Jared,

341
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,760
because for someone
with the amount of power he has,

342
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,520
have you ever heard him speak ?

343
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,760
Seriously,
what does his voice sound like ?

344
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,800
You don't know, do you ?
It wasn't easy,

345
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:28,160
but we manage to find an interview
of him talking on TV in 2009.

346
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,200
My main business is real estate
and I also own a newspaper

347
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,000
and other websites
and online media businesses.

348
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:42,840
I know what you're thinking,
you're thinking hold on:

349
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,160
"you took that clip, and
you dubbed in Gilbert Gottfried".

350
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,120
But you don't know that
for sure. Listen to it again.

351
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,520
My main business is real estate

352
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,600
and I own a newspaper and other
websites and online media businesses.

353
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,680
You don't know for a fact
that is not his actual voice.

354
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,600
And that is the real point.

355
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,000
So, in the absence
of Jared's spoken thoughts,

356
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,680
we've had to rely on
second-hand evidence of his brilliance.

357
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,320
First thing many people cite
is his education.

358
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,880
Jared is a great young man,
went to Harvard. Very smart.

359
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,200
Went to Harvard.

360
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:21,160
He's a number one at Harvard guy.
He's incredibly smart.

361
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,600
That's not evidence of anything.
The Unabomber went to Harvard.

362
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,400
Ted Cruz went to Harvard.
Plenty of smart people went there too,

363
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,040
they'll tell you about it,

364
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,960
but it is worth noting that officials
at Jared's high school

365
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,520
were reportedly dismayed he got in,
because, as one put it:

366
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,920
"his GPA did not warrant it,
his SAT scores did not warrant it."

367
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,800
Who knows how
he pulled that off ?

368
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,040
I'm sure it's nothing to do
with the fact

369
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,400
that his father pledged $2.5 million
to the school before he was admitted.

370
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,640
I'm certainly not saying that is
a case of paying for admission.

371
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,000
I'll leave that to the textbook
the "Price of Admission",

372
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,240
in which that story
actually appears.

373
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:10,080
After graduating, he took over
his father's real-estate business,

374
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,560
after his dad, Charlie,
was sent to prison.

375
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,120
I don't have time to get into why.
Let me say:

376
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,440
it involves blackmailing
his brother-in-law, a sex worker

377
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:24,120
and a hidden camera in a shitbox
motel on Route 22, The Red Bull Inn.

378
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,640
The story I promise is amazing:
it is worth a Google.

379
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,960
You're gonna need
the safe search off.

380
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,960
How has Jared run
the family business ?

381
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,360
He made a big splash when
he bought 666 Fifth Avenue

382
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,720
for a record $1.8 billion in 2007.

383
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,520
But that deal has not been
a raging success.

384
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,480
The deal was a miscalculation.

385
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:53,240
He bought at the top of the market
so then the market turned.

386
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,120
Ten years later the building
is struggling to cover its debt.

387
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,040
Kushner's purchase did make a splash,
but it turned out to be

388
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,720
the kind of splash your phone
makes when it falls into the toilet.

389
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,080
That building is not Jared's
whole record in business.

390
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,040
He owned the New York Observer,
which even the paper's staff found odd,

391
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,040
people described him
as "unenthusiastic reader,"

392
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,960
"with little use for newspapers,
let alone books."

393
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,960
He spearheaded a Brooklyn
development called "Dumbo Heights".

394
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,720
His partner praised
his involvement, saying:

395
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,000
"He's very uncluttered in his mind..."

396
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,600
"I think that simplicity
allows him to filter some things out."

397
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,600
Which could be
a compliment or a savage insult.

398
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,200
To give you a flavor of what Jared's
vision for Dumbo Heights is,

399
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,440
watch a video that he showed
to a real estate conference.

400
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,480
The most infuriating combination
of meaningless tech nonsense

401
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,880
and stock footage of models
that you will ever see.

402
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,240
Dumbo Heights, a dynamic space,
mechanically engineered

403
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,400
for optimal performance
and unrivalled connectivity.

404
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,360
This campus is the staging ground for
the next innovators and creators.

405
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,600
Change is forged in the fire
of great thinkers and visionaries.

406
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,240
A community built for collaboration.

407
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,880
When innovation is cultivated,
the world rises to meet.

408
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:21,920
Dope. Now, it's hard to pick,
but I think my favorite phrase

409
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,600
is actually bragging the development
is "mechanically engineered".

410
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,520
What are the other options ?
How many office buildings

411
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,920
are "naturally occurring" or "created
with a wish on a genie's lamp ?"

412
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,400
If you are concerned Jared's
business record may not qualify him,

413
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,640
I point out one other prominent
item that is on his resume:

414
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,240
the 2016 election.

415
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,120
A few weeks after it was over,

416
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,240
Forbes ran a cover story titled
"This Guy Got Trump Elected",

417
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,640
sounds impressive
and it features quotes from Jared like:

418
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,720
"we played moneyball,
asking ourselves which states"

419
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,320
"will get the best ROI
for the electoral vote".

420
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,680
A sentence that can only be forged
in the uncluttered mind

421
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,600
of the wizard of Dumbo Heights.

422
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,920
The article give examples
of what specific technical expertise

423
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,880
Jared may've brought
into the operation.

424
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,400
They found a way to get people on
Facebook and Twitter.

425
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,680
They evolved into this 100-person
secret data center in San Antonio

426
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,680
and they had data do everything.

427
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,920
Data determined his schedule,
rallies, even what he spoke about.

428
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,480
Even what he spoke about ?

429
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,640
Really ? Data determined what
Trump spoke about at his rallies.

430
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,000
I don't doubt there were 100 people
in a basement somewhere

431
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,680
"moneyballing the ROI".

432
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,560
I would love to see the data
that recommended this.

433
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,920
I love these boards.
Look, here's a beauty.

434
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,400
I love charts.

435
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,920
I always said it's too
tough putting a screen up.

436
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,920
Gotta get guys, it costs,
I don't like to spend money.

437
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,000
This is a cheap version of a screen.
It's just as good.

438
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:07,240
Like you need good, strong hands.
You ready ? So, there it is.

439
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,720
Thanks, Jared. You mechanically
engineered the shit out of that one.

440
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,080
Trump did win the election.
And I wasn't there. So who knows ?

441
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,040
Maybe Jared is single-handedly
responsible for the entire victory.

442
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,280
But that still doesn't mean
he has the specific knowledge

443
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,080
to tackle government reform,
Middle East or the opioids epidemic.

444
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,960
Can somebody please reassure me
that this is okay ?

445
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,960
Jared is incredibly smart, talented,
has enormous capacity.

446
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:44,040
He is humble in the recognition
of what he doesn't know

447
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,120
and is secure in his ability

448
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,360
to seek informed viewpoints.

449
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,880
No, not you. Not you.
I know your game now. Not you.

450
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,320
To that point that he will
seek informed viewpoints,

451
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,120
that will be harder since there
are still hundreds of key jobs

452
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,960
across the government that
Trump has not yet named nominees for:

453
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:13,840
the Department of Transportation,
the DEA, and the VA.

454
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,200
It is too bad that Trump can't appoint
someone to nominate people,

455
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,800
although I am sure he'd give
that job to Jared fucking Kushner.

456
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,360
The truth is,
for many people,

457
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,360
the main thing qualifying Jared
for his positions is not who he is,

458
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,520
but who he isn't.

459
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,040
As many questions I have about Jared,
Ivanka and they're qualifications,

460
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,560
they're more qualified
than Steve Bannon.

461
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:43,120
I would prefer to have them rather than
Mr. Bannon involved in decisions.

462
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,560
Is he James Baker ?
No, he's not James Baker.

463
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,560
But is he Steve Bannon ?
No, he's not Steve Bannon.

464
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,160
That is true,
Jared Kushner is not Steve Bannon.

465
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,400
That is a low bar. That recommendation
would get you no other job.

466
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,640
We shouldn't be excited
about a top White House adviser,

467
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,560
because he is preferable to a man
best described as:

468
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,120
"every dark thought humanity
has ever had,"

469
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,080
"inhabiting the longdead corpse
of a Civil War-era plantation owner"

470
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,520
"that even his fellow plantation
owners called a bit much."

471
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:19,480
There has to be a third option.
Even some people who know Jared

472
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,320
and like him
have some serious questions.

473
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:27,160
I know Jared Kushner and Ivanka.
They're lovely, young people.

474
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:32,640
Does this person have qualifications ?
Lovely guy ! I'm sure level-headed.

475
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,320
Yes, he's temperamentally sane
versus the president. Got it.

476
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,480
Having said that, what has
this guy done in his life ever ?

477
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,880
He said: "lovely young man. Seems
levelheaded. What's he done ?"

478
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,640
It does not bode well
that Kushner's neighbors

479
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,200
describe him like he got arrested
for murdering eleven people.

480
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,160
In the end,
this isn't even Jared's fault.

481
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,600
It's the fault of the guy
who appointed him.

482
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,800
Imagine anyone other than
Donald Trump was president.

483
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,000
And hold that thought.
It's nice, right ?

484
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,960
Imagine this stock photo guy
was in office. This guy.

485
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:17,040
And he said: "I'm gonna fix Middle East,
opioids, and the whole of government"

486
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,600
"and I've found
the perfect person to do it:"

487
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:26,120
"it's this creepily silent, 36-year-old
heir to a real estate fortune."

488
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,360
You would justifiably
be fucking upset at that.

489
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,760
This may seem like an evisceration
of both Jared and Ivanka,

490
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,360
but it is really not.

491
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,000
I don't know enough about them
to eviscerate them.

492
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,440
Just as you don't know enough about
them to justify putting hopes in them.

493
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,280
It is dangerous to think of them
as a moderating influence.

494
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,240
Believe me, and it gives me
no pleasure to say this:

495
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,120
if they are the reason
you are sleeping at night,

496
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,360
you should probably
still be awake.

497
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,080
If you need help doing that,
simply remember:

498
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,080
Trump may currently be airing out
his balls in the Lincoln bedroom.

499
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,120
Sweet dreams.
And now this.

500
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,240
And finally, Bill O'Reilly:
A Life In Television.

501
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,200
I'm sexist,
I'm a bigot, I'm a racist.

502
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,440
Let's just get it on the table,
I'm everything.

503
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,960
Racist, sexist, or any other 'ist'
the far left embraces.

504
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,640
They're gonna point at people,
you're a racist, you're a sexist,

505
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,960
you made me uncomfortable,
you did this.

506
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,680
What about the sexism thing.

507
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,640
The fact that I said
va va voom makes me a sexist ?

508
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,480
- No.
- It doesn't, are you sure ?

509
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,880
I wanted two ladies on here,
I know I'm insensitive.

510
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,240
You are both female.

511
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,680
There's gotta be some downside
to having a woman president.

512
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:56,680
Something that may not fit
with that office.

513
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,600
Many pregnant women are blasted
out of their minds when they have sex.

514
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,080
When you hear me try to talk,
button it up.

515
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,080
No, you're snorting out there.
Knock it off.

516
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,400
If you were a man
I'd have scolded you.

517
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:15,040
You don't want to be treated equally,
you want special treatment.

518
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,640
She looks good for 50.

519
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,960
You chilly here in this outfit ?
You're calling me sexist.

520
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,440
I'd go on the lesbian cruise.
I'd see it as a challenge.

521
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,280
Ladies, good to be,
we're not mad at you, Kirsten,

522
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,280
I'm sorry if I mischaracterized
what you were doing.

523
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,120
I want respect for everyone.

524
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,320
White people don't force blacks
to have babies out of wedlock.

525
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,400
I do not believe you are granted
favorable treatment in this country

526
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,080
because you are white.

527
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,480
The white establishment
is now the minority.

528
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,480
The race hustlers
blame white privilege.

529
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,760
You can't be blaming the white
people for everything.

530
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,120
There's no white privilege,
there must be Asian privilege.

531
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,200
Asians are at the top of the chart and
African Americans are at the bottom.

532
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,760
It has nothing to do with slavery,
it has everything to do

533
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,080
with you Hollywood people
and you derelict parents.

534
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,520
By nature, I'm kind of a hot head.
This is justice.

535
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,440
And you want anarchy !

536
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,440
When things go wrong, you should
not react, until you cool down.

537
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,720
We'll do it live. Fuck it !
Do it live.

538
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:28,200
If you raise your voice even
slightly, you're labeled a maniac.

539
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:33,440
I'll write it and we'll do it live.
Fucking thing sucks.

540
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,680
Bill O'Reilly.
The fucking guy sucked.

541
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,920
That's our show. We're off next week,
back after that. Good night !

542
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,240
My main business is real estate.

543
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,960
