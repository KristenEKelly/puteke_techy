00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,520
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,280
SEASON IV
EPISODE 1

3
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,120
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !

4
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,760
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

5
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,120
We're back,
and a lot has happened.

6
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,000
A lot has happened
since we last saw you. So...

7
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,800
We need to address the big elephant
in the room straight away:

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,040
How 'bout "The Young Pope" ?

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,960
Pretty crazy, right ?
There's a kangaroo in the Vatican !

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,920
I can't think of anything more shocking
to have happened in the last months !

11
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,920
I guess there was that one thing.

12
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,040
The United States has a new president.
The 45th president.

13
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,400
There he is. Donald J. Trump.

14
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,520
We live under President Trump, 2 words
that will never sound normal together,

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,760
no matter how many times
you say them.

16
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,120
Like "panda mustard"
or "Mom's orgasm".

17
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,000
The last weeks have been frantic. Trump
has nominated a Supreme Court justice

18
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,640
and issued 24 executive orders
and memoranda,

19
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,640
one of which the notorious "travel ban"
has been smacked down in court,

20
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,840
to which he tweeted nonsensically,
"See you in court !".

21
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,560
He failed to mention Jews in
a Holocaust Remembrance statement,

22
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,920
made fun of Arnold Schwarzenegger's
ratings on "The Celebrity Apprentice",

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,480
and twitter-bullied Mexican president
into canceling his visit to the US.

24
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,560
That is just the tip of the shitberg.
It has been so busy,

25
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,760
it's gotten to the point
where the most terrifying sound

26
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,120
is your phone buzzing
with a news alert.

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,360
I hate to say this,
but I found myself at one point saying:

28
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,440
"Thank God,
it's just that Mary Tyler Moore's dead."

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,360
"That is a massive relief."

30
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,000
We've been living in a world
where if someone says "good morning",

31
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,120
the only acceptable response is:
"No it isn't. What is wrong with you ?"

32
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,960
And even if you try to avoid the news,
someone will come up to you and say:

33
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,480
"The new Secretary of Labor
is a giant jar of wasps". I'm kidding.

34
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,640
The nominee is Andrew Puzder, who
has opposed raising the minimum wage,

35
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,600
and who currently heads
Hardee's and Carl's Junior,

36
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,240
the chains famous
for tasteful ads like this.

37
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,480
Introducing the classic patty melt.
With a spicy twist.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,760
I like it hot !

39
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,160
That is truly the perfect ad
to prepare you for the actual interior

40
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,640
of a Carl's Junior restaurant,
which is undeniably so hot.

41
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,880
But remember Trump's
attorney general is Jeff Sessions,

42
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,680
named "Man of the Year"
by "Wrong Side of History Magazine".

43
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,320
All Trump's nominees seem
to have been chosen sarcastically.

44
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,520
The Secretary of Education
hates public education system,

45
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,400
the nominee to head the EPA
hates the EPA,

46
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,120
and the future Secretary of Energy
is this guy.

47
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,600
Cool !

48
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,680
Rick Perry once proposed eliminating
the department that he will soon head,

49
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,880
although he later recanted, saying:

50
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,880
"After being briefed on so many of the
functions of the Department of Energy,"

51
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,360
"I regret recommending
its elimination."

52
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,200
I can imagine he thought it protected
our reserves of Monster energy drinks".

53
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,200
"Come on, you can't have
monsters gettin' energy !"

54
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,120
"Why're we even givin' em drinks ?
Department needs to be shut down !"

55
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,120
With the pace of chaos
raining upon us,

56
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,200
it is important to find something
to center yourself.

57
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,000
I have been using
this framed photograph of Eddie,

58
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,120
the dog
from the TV show "Frasier".

59
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,160
I look at this
whenever I want to feel better.

60
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,480
Eddie is the perfect example

61
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,440
of something that has no idea
what's going on in the world:

62
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,560
he's a dog, he's fictional,
and he's almost certainly dead.

63
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,440
And at various times these past
few weeks,

64
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,800
I have been genuinely jealous
of all three of those things.

65
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,160
This is going to be
a long presidency.

66
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,920
And perhaps nothing encapsulated
the way many of us feel right now

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
better than Japanese Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe.

68
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,040
He met with our new president
for what was a comically long

69
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,360
and marathon-like handshake,
but watch his expression at the end.

70
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,840
I feel you !

71
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,960
That is the prime minister

72
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,440
of a country known for awkwardly
long formal displays of respect.

73
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,200
And even he is going:
"Fuck this shit".

74
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,880
And now this !

75
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,680
And now... Donald Trump
can't shake hands right.

76
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,960
Thank you very much.

77
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Moving on. Our main story tonight
is going to be a little different.

78
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,840
Normally, we like to focus this part
on complex, depressing policy issues.

79
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,200
Something fun,
like CO2 emissions from hearses,

80
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,840
or space poverty,

81
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,280
or the proliferation of special-purpose
taxing districts, a topic so boring,

82
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,600
you didn't realize we already did that
exact story last year.

83
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,040
And we want
to keep doing those things,

84
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,880
but we can't until we address
something even bigger:

85
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,040
the concept of Reality itself.

86
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,560
And that is because of this guy.

87
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,120
Since taking office
around 412 years ago,

88
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,920
Trump has made it clear that reality
is not important to him.

89
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,080
He's exaggerated
the size of his inauguration crowd,

90
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,840
he said the election was marred
by mass voter fraud with no proof,

91
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,960
and he also falsely claimed
that compared to Muslims,

92
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,840
it was almost impossible for Christian
refugees from Syria to get into the US.

93
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,480
He even lied about the weather
during his inauguration.

94
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,880
The rain should have scared them away
but God looked down and he said:

95
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,520
"We're not gonna let it rain
on your speech".

96
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,960
No, he didn't. First, it did rain
while you were speaking

97
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,680
that's why your wife
was holding up an umbrella,

98
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,320
and people behind
you were wearing ponchos.

99
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,240
And if God did look down,
his only thought would've been:

100
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,120
"The Mormon Tabernacle Choir ?"

101
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,840
"I'm sick of them, and I'm God.
Could you not book silence ?"

102
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,000
"Or was silence somehow
boycotting this thing, too ?"

103
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,680
So, that is where we are currently at.
We have a president capable

104
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,840
of standing in the rain
and saying it was a sunny day.

105
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,400
"Donald Trump lies"
is clearly not a fresh observation.

106
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,760
Liberals are probably thinking:
"Hot take there, Johnny !"

107
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,680
"Next you're going to tell me that
Obama is aloof, Dick Cheney is evil,"

108
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,360
"and Paul Ryan doesn't climax
until he checks his FitBit"

109
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,320
"to see how many calories
he's burned from fucking".

110
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,480
If you're on the other side,
you're probably thinking,

111
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,560
"Another blizzard of snowflakes"

112
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,840
"from "Last Cuck Tonight
with Johnny Trigger-Warning".

113
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,960
And yes, I know all
other presidents have lied.

114
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,120
Politifact found that over a quarter
of President Obama's statements,

115
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,880
that they evaluated,
were some degree of false.

116
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,240
But with Trump,
that number is currently over 2/3.

117
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,720
Perhaps that is why one reporter
found himself saying this.

118
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,160
This is what makes covering
Donald Trump so very difficult.

119
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,600
What does he mean
when he says words ?

120
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,520
"What does he mean
when he says words ?"

121
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,880
We are talking about the president

122
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,960
like a Tindr match
we've been on 4 dates with.

123
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,600
"I asked him if he we could hang out
this Friday and he said"

124
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,320
"Prolly, dot dot dot, I'm starving,
bicycle-emoji poop-emoji".

125
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,400
"What does he mean
when he says words ?"

126
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,840
Trump's relationship
with the truth

127
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,880
is going to be of profound
importance going forward.

128
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,800
Any policy discussion has to begin
with a shared sense of reality.

129
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,240
And Trump's reality can change
within a single sentence.

130
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,680
When you hear
4.9 and 5 percent unemployment,

131
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,480
the number's probably
28, 29, as high as 35

132
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,800
in fact,
I even heard recently 42 percent.

133
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,360
Which one is it, then ?
Because a 4.9 percent rate

134
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,720
might result in a cautiously
constrictive monetary policy,

135
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,760
whereas a 42 percent rate
might result in The Purge.

136
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,640
So we thought it would be useful
to try and answer four questions:

137
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,680
how did we get a pathological liar
in the White House ?

138
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,440
Where are his lies coming from ?
Why do so many people believe him ?

139
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,440
And what can we do about it ?

140
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,600
To that first question,
Trump's lying is nothing new.

141
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,040
He has a well-documented,
40-year history of bullshit.

142
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,600
He lied about being
invited on this show,

143
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,720
and about the ratings
for "The Celebrity Apprentice".

144
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,880
He pretended to be
his own publicist.

145
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,360
Even his building, Trump Tower,
is not as big as he says it is.

146
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,200
He inflated the floor numbers.

147
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,040
His 58-story building
became a 68-story building.

148
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,440
It made a lot of sense in his mind.
If you're renting a room,

149
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,520
you'd rather be on the 14th floor
than on the 6th floor.

150
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,240
Spare a thought for firefighters
turning up to that building.

151
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,120
"The smoke alarm's going off
in penthouse B on the 68th floor,"

152
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,240
"which is apparently
an alcove studio on the 58th."

153
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,000
"Quick, it's an emergency."

154
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,720
But lies like that
are almost charming.

155
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,400
What is less harmless

156
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,400
is when he started lying
about the president's birth certificate,

157
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,400
and then started making
troubling statements like these.

158
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,760
The murder rate in the United States,

159
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,760
it's the worst,
the highest it's been in 45 years.

160
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,040
Our president wants to take in
250 000 from Syria.

161
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:11,600
Our gross domestic product,
a sign of strength, right ?

162
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,880
But not for us. It was below zero.
Who ever heard of this ?

163
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,000
Real quick on those:
no it isn't, no he didn't,

164
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,160
and no one's ever heard
of a GDP below zero,

165
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,080
because that is impossible.

166
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,400
Any one of those falsehoods
could have disqualified him for office.

167
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,080
We were so accustomed
to Trump's nonsense,

168
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,240
people could just shrug it off
as "Donald being Donald".

169
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,600
His advisers argued that people
shouldn't worry about his statements,

170
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,720
because he didn't really
mean them.

171
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,600
I think a lot of the voters
who vote for Trump

172
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,440
take Trump seriously,
but not literally.

173
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,720
When they hear things like the Muslim
comment or the wall comment,

174
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,600
the question is not are you gonna build
a wall like the Great Wall of China,

175
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,040
or how exactly are you
gonna enforce these tests ?

176
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,080
What they hear is,
we're gonna have...

177
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,960
a saner,
more sensible immigration policy.

178
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,960
That is definitely the sense I got
from watching those Trump rallies.

179
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,720
"Yes, while we are all furiously
chanting build that wall,"

180
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,280
"we all understand, in this context,
wall is a clever use of metonymy,"

181
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,440
"or a figure of speech
in which one word, wall,"

182
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,720
"is used as a stand-in for a saner,
more sensible immigration policy."

183
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,720
Now, if you will,
let's unpack 'Trump the bitch'.

184
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,840
Yet the travel ban literally happened,
and as for the wall...

185
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,040
The wall is getting designed
right now.

186
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,280
A lot of people say,
"Trump was only kidding..."

187
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,720
I don't kid.

188
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,160
Exactly, when he says he's going
to build a wall, he means it.

189
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:09,160
It might be 30 feet and labeled 156
stories but assume that it's coming.

190
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,520
It was worth taking him seriously.
Trump was telling the truth

191
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,920
about his solutions to the problems
he was lying about.

192
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,160
And he is now making real policy
based on fake facts.

193
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,760
Which brings us to our second question:
where is his information coming from ?

194
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,880
Trump himself has admitted
he gets a lot of it from TV.

195
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,600
Which may explain
why he speaks so confidently

196
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,560
about cable news staples
like crime and terrorism,

197
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,640
but when it comes to the nuts-and-bolts
aspects of government

198
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,920
like the nuclear triad, he struggles.

199
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,760
He famously flubbed a question
on the triad during an early debate,

200
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,800
in an exchange that ended like this.

201
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,480
So the three legs of the triad,
though, do you have a priority ?

202
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,120
To me, nuclear's just the power,
the devastation is very important.

203
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,560
That is terrifying. The components
of that triad are important.

204
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,200
It is unacceptable not to be able
to name every one of them,

205
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,960
they are nuclear weapons,
not your children.

206
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,560
What is her name, Donald ?
What is her name ?

207
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,560
I'll give you a hint. It starts with T.
And it's not the other one.

208
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,320
And you would hope that,
as President,

209
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,640
he'd be getting information
from primary sources,

210
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,000
but Trump still watches
a phenomenal amount of cable news.

211
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,520
His tweets frequently echo things
that just aired on TV.

212
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,120
Two weeks ago, he tweeted,
"ungrateful traitor Chelsea Manning"

213
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,480
"is now calling President Obama
a weak leader. Terrible !"

214
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,000
Interesting, because Chelsea Manning
never used the words "weak leader".

215
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:51,160
That phrase was used on Fox News
just 15 minutes before he tweeted,

216
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,840
in a segment, which also called
Manning an "ungrateful traitor".

217
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:00,040
The President seems to tweet about
whatever information he saw on news.

218
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,760
If someone changed the channel
to the Sprout network, he'd tweet,

219
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,320
"Caillou's life is boring
even for a cancer kid. Sad !"

220
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,160
Now to give you a sense of just
how much he watches cable news,

221
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,040
a few hours later,
he was on Air Force One,

222
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,200
and you could hear
the commercials from Fox News

223
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,920
blaring in the background.

224
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,840
- Thank you.
- How was your first flight ?

225
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,960
That's real. That is the Empire Carpet
jingle playing at full blast.

226
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,840
Trump just made
the interior of Air Force One

227
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,320
sound like the living room
of an old person

228
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,200
who died three days ago
and who nobody's found yet.

229
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,480
He watches so much cable TV,

230
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,040
he presumably also gets
daily briefings from this guy.

231
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,400
I'm a professional cowboy,
and I use catheters.

232
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,200
Been cowboyin' for 25 years.
I've broken 14 bones,

233
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,880
had two concussions
and a punctured lung.

234
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,160
I know pain, and I don't want
any more of it. Especially when I cath.

235
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,400
Stop.
I have so many questions.

236
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,000
Is "cath" a real verb ? If you've
only been "cowboyin'" for 25 years,

237
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,400
what did you do
before you were cowboyin' ?

238
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,080
Why are you in a library that doesn't
want to overdo it with the books ?

239
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,440
You fascinate me.

240
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,720
But Trump doesn't just
watch cable news,

241
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,840
he also takes information in
from unreliable sources,

242
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,040
such as Breitbart,
the organization

243
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,640
which gave us Steve Bannon,
now Trump's chief strategist.

244
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,280
Breitbart has published
such Pulitzer-eligible stories

245
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,640
as "birth control makes women
unattractive and crazy",

246
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,040
"racist, pro-Nazi roots of Planned
Parenthood revealed"

247
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,840
and "hoist it high and proud:"

248
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,000
"the Confederate flag proclaims
a glorious heritage."

249
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,800
The kind you see your old
high school friends share on Facebook

250
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,120
and think: "That's a shame.
I guess Greg sucks now."

251
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,480
Trump's trust in Breitbart
goes way back.

252
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,560
Years ago, Trump
was challenged by Bill O'Reilly,

253
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,000
who pointed out that his claim
that thousands of Muslims

254
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,560
were seen celebrating
in New Jersey on 9/11

255
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,920
was based on no evidence
and this is how Trump responded.

256
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:24,680
I don't know that I'm wrong.
This came out from Breitbart.

257
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,960
Trump vindicated,
100% vindicated.

258
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,920
If there were thousands that
would have been reported.

259
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,200
This article says
they were swarming.

260
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,480
This article says they were swarming
all over the place.

261
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,440
It means a lot of people.

262
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,720
Holding up a Breitbart article does
not make you seem more credible.

263
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,560
You might as well have gone:
"Hold on a second, Bill. Hello ?"

264
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:55,200
Sources are saying I'm right.
Talk to my sources, William.

265
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,520
Trump's sources get even worse.
Because he also cited an article

266
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,960
to support his "Muslims on 9/11"
claim from "Infowars",

267
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,920
a website run by this guy.

268
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,680
Hillary and Obama want to make you
poor and pathetic. They hate you !

269
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,480
They hate prosperity, God,
children ! God damn them to hell !

270
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,520
That man is Alex Jones and that
is him at his most presentable.

271
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,480
That is Alex Jones at a job interview.

272
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,440
That's Alex Jones meeting
his girlfriend's parents first time.

273
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:38,280
Jones has argued the government
has the ability to control tornadoes,

274
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,720
that the Boston marathon bombing
was a "false flag" attack

275
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,640
and that tap water
is a "gay bomb"

276
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,880
and that they are putting chemicals
in that "turn the friggin' frogs gay".

277
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,560
Then there is the Sandy Hook
school shooting.

278
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,880
Sandy Hook is a synthetic,

279
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,640
completely fake, with actors,
in my view, manufactured.

280
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,160
I couldn't believe it at first.
I knew they had actors there,

281
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,280
but I thought
they killed real kids.

282
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:11,560
It just shows how bold they are,
that they clearly used actors.

283
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,520
That is not just offensive,
it's stupid.

284
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,680
If the government had
hired child actors,

285
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,680
there is no way their stage parents
would've stopped talking about it.

286
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,920
Didn't get the Tide commercial,
but booked a leading role

287
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,680
in a government-sponsored
false-flag attack.

288
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,640
The same director who did
the moon landing ! We're excited.

289
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,960
Trump is such a fan
that Alex Jones himself has said:

290
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,720
"it is surreal to talk about issues
here on air"

291
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,920
"and then word for word hear
Trump say it two days later."

292
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,480
I would be skeptical,

293
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,200
if Trump hadn't gone
on Jones's show and said this.

294
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,720
I want to finish by saying
your reputation's amazing.

295
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,360
I will not let you down.
You will be impressed, I hope.

296
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,480
I think we'll be speaking a lot.

297
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,120
It makes sense that Trump
wants to impress Alex Jones.

298
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,280
Why "drain the swamp", if not
to eradicate all those gay frogs ?

299
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,560
Stay there,
you two stay where you are.

300
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,640
This is really dangerous,
because there is a pattern:

301
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,600
Trump sees something that jibes with
his worldview, doesn't check it,

302
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,000
half-remembers it
and then passes it on,

303
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,800
it takes on a life of its own
and appears to validate itself.

304
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,560
Let me try and show you
that machine in action.

305
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,440
Trump's constant claim that millions
of people voted illegally

306
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,480
originated from some dude
on Twitter, who claimed in November,

307
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,240
while providing no evidence:

308
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,280
"we have verified more than
3 million votes cast by non-citizens."

309
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,880
Next day, Infowars picked that up
and it spread like jet fuel.

310
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,560
It was debunked by multiple outlets,
but despite that, days later,

311
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,560
President-Elect Trump started tweeting
about "millions of illegal votes"

312
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,720
and "serious voter fraud"
in states like California.

313
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,120
In December, people were on TV,
expressing similar concerns.

314
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,880
Voting is a privilege in this country.
And you need to be legal,

315
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,280
not like California
where 3 million illegals voted.

316
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,200
- Where are you getting your info ?
- From the media.

317
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,920
That answers our third question,
of why so many people believe Trump.

318
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,200
If you get your news
from similar sources to him,

319
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,600
as many people do,
he doesn't look like a crank.

320
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,440
He looks like the first President
ever to tell you the real truth.

321
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,600
Rumors can be tenacious.
I'll prove it:

322
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,200
what rumor do you think of
when you hear the name Richard Gere ?

323
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,000
Here's the thing:
there is no proof that he did that.

324
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,800
If you think, it's ridiculous. Have you
ever held one of those things ?

325
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,520
No way it was possible !
But if the President went on TV

326
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:02,640
and told you it was true, you'd go:
"I knew it ! Finally someone said it."

327
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,880
That loop gets more dangerous when
you're not talking about gerbils.

328
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,280
Trump validated his supporters'
beliefs about voter fraud.

329
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,560
And in turn, they validated his.

330
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,200
When he was confronted with the lack
of evidence, this is how he responded.

331
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,360
It's important that millions
agree with me when I say that.

332
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:28,200
If you've looked at the other networks
and the people were calling in said:

333
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,080
"we agree with Mr. Trump",
they're smart people.

334
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,760
Just because they believe you, and you
believe them, doesn't make it true.

335
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,600
This isn't like Peter Pan,

336
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,840
where believing in fairies
will keep Tinkerbell alive.

337
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,200
This isn't a magic thing, Peter !
She has Lou Gehrig's Disease !

338
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,840
Instead of clapping, you should've
done the ice bucket challenge !

339
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,440
Then she'd still be alive !
I'm sorry Peter, but she's dying.

340
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,080
Tinkerbell's dying.

341
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,080
Even if you take the kindest
approach here

342
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,880
and assume Trump made
an innocent mistake,

343
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,360
passed along a story
without checking it,

344
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,040
when he was presented
with a lack of evidence,

345
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,800
he disregarded that fact,
at which point, he is lying.

346
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,440
It seems no one in the White House
has a problem with that.

347
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,480
When asked to justify President's
views, this is what Sean Spicer did.

348
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,840
President
believed that a while.

349
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,640
A longstanding belief he's maintained.
It's a belief he maintains.

350
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,320
It's a belief that he's maintained.
He's believed this for a long time.

351
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,880
A comment he made
on a long-standing belief.

352
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,000
He believes what he believes based
on the information he's provided.

353
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,240
What does
that mean for democracy ?

354
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,680
- I've answered your question.
- Have you ?

355
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,160
No, you haven't, Melissa...

356
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,800
Because this isn't about belief.

357
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,200
It can't be. The incidence
of voter fraud is a verifiable fact.

358
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,280
And faith and facts aren't like
Bill Pullman and Bill Paxton.

359
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,360
When you confuse them,
it actually matters.

360
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,080
Real people get hurt when you make
policy based on false information.

361
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,080
Billions will get spent
on a wall that won't work,

362
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,520
while refugees sit in dangerous
situations

363
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,800
to prevent "Bowling Green"-style
massacres that never took place.

364
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:27,080
What are we going to do ?
The press is going to be a key element

365
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,000
in helping us sort out fact from
fiction and they are under attack.

366
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,080
This administration seized on small
corrections in news coverage

367
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,360
attempting to delegitimize
all of them.

368
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,760
This is only going to get worse.
Steve Bannon has labeled the media

369
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,160
the "opposition party", although there
does seem to be one exception.

370
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,280
The only seat that was reserved for
the media at Trump's news conference

371
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,240
was in the front row
and it was for Breitbart News.

372
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,480
That is some blatant favoritism.

373
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,640
You are Snow White
introducing the dwarfs saying:

374
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,320
"Meet Grumpy, Sleepy, Sneezy,
big-dick-cool-dwarf and three others."

375
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,760
If you are thinking that Breitbart
went out of their way

376
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,440
to ask a challenging question,
think again.

377
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,280
Go ahead.

378
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,440
With CNN's decision to publish fake
news over the course of the election,

379
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,240
what reforms do you recommend
for this industry here ?

380
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,920
I have two follow-up questions:
does this feel good ?

381
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,800
And will you let me know
when you're going to come ?

382
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,000
Just tap my head.

383
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,760
The end game is obvious:
with a delegitimized press,

384
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,200
you're only going to have
one source to get your news from

385
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,120
as one congressman
pointed out.

386
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,840
Better to get your news
directly from the President.

387
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,360
It might be the only way
to get the unvarnished truth.

388
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,760
Getting your news from the leader
is the philosophy of North Korea.

389
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,440
The notion that our leaders

390
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,680
should be able to pass
on mistruths with impunity,

391
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,880
should be alarming
to everybody, regardless of politics.

392
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,280
Republicans should want our sense
of objective reality to remain intact,

393
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,040
in case the Democrats
find their own appealing reality star

394
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,920
to win back the White House,
RuPaul, for instance.

395
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,960
Make America fierce again.
Hashtag make America fierce again.

396
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,920
We need to commit
to defending the reality of facts.

397
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,800
As we've already seen, protests,
calls to legislators, and lawsuits

398
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,680
are ways to try and drag
the administration back to reality.

399
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,800
But this needs to go down
to a personal level, as well.

400
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,240
We should make extra efforts
on social media to verify stories.

401
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,440
Especially if they confirm
our pre-existing biases.

402
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,320
Ask questions like: "is this
a source I know and recognize ?"

403
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:01,040
Does it link to primary sources and do
sources match what the story says ?

404
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,000
If you see an outlet getting things
wrong and never correcting it,

405
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,880
maybe stop trusting it, whether
that outlet is some idiot's blog

406
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,400
or the White House.

407
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,280
I know our President will not
follow any of those suggestions,

408
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,520
partly because rightfully,
he does not watch this show,

409
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:24,240
there is one small way we wanted
to try and sneak some useful facts.

410
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,680
He watches morning cable news
for information.

411
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,280
We've created commercials,

412
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,200
to bring him up to speed on
some information he may lack.

413
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:39,200
We'll run them on shows we know
he watches every day. Take a look.

414
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,240
Catheter patients !

415
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,120
I'm a professional cowboy
and I use catheters.

416
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,440
Been cowboying for 25 years
and there's two things I know.

417
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,360
I don't like pain when I cath
and the nuclear triad

418
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,440
consists of land-based missiles,

419
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,360
submarine-launched missiles
and aerial bombers.

420
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,560
This increases our ability to
strike back in the event

421
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,440
one of those is destroyed and
deters an attack on us or our allies.

422
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,120
That's the nuclear triad,

423
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,600
in case you're the person
who might really need to know that.

424
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,400
That ad will air tomorrow
morning between 8:30 and 9

425
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,160
on all these channels in the DC area.

426
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,440
And until we're shut down,
we are prepared to educate Trump

427
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,600
on topics we're pretty sure
he doesn't know about.

428
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,080
Might seem like a show of strength
to kill the families of terrorists,

429
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,440
but according to Geneva Conventions,
it's a war crime.

430
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,480
Not all black people live
in the inner cities

431
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,240
and not all people
in the inner cities are black.

432
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,880
There's something you may not know.

433
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,680
Appetizer fork, entrée fork.

434
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,240
I know it can sometimes feel as if
you are the only person in the world.

435
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:56,360
But, as you can see here, there
are many non-you people.

436
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,560
We call those other people.

437
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,000
Just because sometimes it's cold,
don't mean there's no global warming.

438
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,000
You confuse climate
with weather.

439
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,200
Gabon is a country on
the west coast of Africa.

440
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:14,280
Tiffany. Tif-fa-ny.

441
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,240
The unemployment rate
is a carefully calculated measure

442
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,840
derived from a monthly survey
conducted by two federal agencies

443
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,200
and has been the agreed-upon
standard since 1948.

444
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,440
And that little fella there

445
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,480
is what we call the clitoris.

446
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,200
Just remember, Donald, if you
don't know, it's okay to ask.

447
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,280
See you tomorrow.

448
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,880
That's our show. We'll see you
next week, good night !

449
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,680
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

450
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,480
END OF EPISODE 1,
SEASON IV
