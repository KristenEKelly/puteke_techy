LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
Season IV
Episode 27

3
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,280
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,960
Thank you for joining us.
It has been yet another hectic week,

5
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,400
from wildfires in California,
to problems in Puerto Rico,

6
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,200
to more details
concerning Harvey Weinstein.

7
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,040
It's not just his behavior
that was troubling,

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,520
it's the way people
around him excused it.

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,280
Nothing is more emblematic of that
than this story told by Angie Everhart.

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,200
While she was sleeping
on a boat at the Cannes Film Festival,

11
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,840
Weinstein broke into her room
and masturbated in front of her.

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,040
I told people on the boat,

13
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,880
and everyone was like:
"that's just Harvey".

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,520
What the fuck ? So everyone knew
and they just went with it ?

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,640
Harvey's gonna burst into your room
and masturbate. That's just Harvey.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,040
He's like a sex-criminal version
of the Kool-Aid man.

17
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,440
While most have
condemned Weinstein's behavior,

18
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,720
some initially tried to defend him,
from Oliver Stone,

19
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,520
whose first response was: "it's not
easy what he's going through",

20
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,480
to longtime friend Donna Karan,
who took an incredible tack.

21
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,680
How do we present
ourselves as women ?

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,720
What are we asking ?
Are we asking for it ?

23
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,720
It's not Harvey Weinstein.
You look at everything,

24
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,320
all over the world today,
and how women are dressing

25
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:56,240
what they're asking by just presenting
themselves the way they do ?

26
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,160
Excuse me ?
One, that is appalling.

27
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,160
And two: how would Donna Karan
know how women are dressing now ?

28
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,880
It's not 1993. Her most
recent work included this hat.

29
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,480
"Howdy there, excellency !"

30
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,080
"If it ain't pious the kid,
the cowboy Pope !"

31
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,880
Both Stone and Karan
did later apologize,

32
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,320
and the Motion Picture Academy
made a big announcement.

33
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,440
The board of governors voting
to expel the once powerful producer,

34
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,280
saying the era of willful ignorance
and shameful complicity

35
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,480
in sexually predatory behavior
and workplace harassment is over.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,440
Yes, finally: the group that counts
among its current members

37
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,400
Roman Polanski, Bill Cosby
and Mel Gibson

38
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,200
has found the one guy who treated
women badly and kicked him out.

39
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,120
Congratulations, Hollywood !
See you at the next Oscars,

40
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,360
where Casey Affleck will be
presenting best actress !

41
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,240
Let's move on to President Trump:

42
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,560
the silver lining for anyone
who died in 2015.

43
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,600
He spent his week continuing efforts
to sabotage Obama-era policies,

44
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,920
beginning with
the Affordable Care Act.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,560
He signed an order intended
to make it easier

46
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,080
to buy cheaper,
shittier health care plans,

47
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,200
which he did by putting a pen in
his mouth and having a seizure.

48
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,760
He eliminated $7 billion in subsidy
payments to insurance companies

49
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,240
which help offset health care expenses
for around seven million Americans.

50
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,280
And the results of that
could be severe.

51
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,480
Nonpartisan Congressional
Budget Office estimated

52
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,560
ending these subsidies will push up
premiums by about 20 percent

53
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,440
in 2018 and add 200 billion dollars
to the deficit over ten years.

54
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,040
Trump's plan is going
to make insurance more expensive

55
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,600
and lose the federal
government more money.

56
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,800
Strategy you can read
about in his book:

57
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,320
"The Art Of Being Bad At Stuff,"
parentheses,

58
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,320
"Including Book Titling,"
no end parentheses.

59
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,760
Even members of his own
party know this is bad politics.

60
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,800
When he's raised the prospect
of cutting subsidies,

61
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,880
some managed
to talk him out of it.

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,920
Republicans are playing checkers.
And Trump is playing Chex.

63
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,040
That's right: Chex, the game
of stress-eating Chex Mix

64
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,760
because you do not understand
your job.

65
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,480
That was not the only case this
week where Trump acted

66
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,320
without seeming
to understand the consequences.

67
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,520
President Trump said he will no longer
certify that Iran is complying

68
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,000
with the nuclear deal, or that
it is in the US national interest.

69
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,320
This goes against what his own
national security team

70
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,720
and all global powers that
signed the deal believe.

71
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,520
Exactly, Trump seems to be
pretty much alone on this.

72
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,520
His Defense Secretary
thinks Iran is in compliance,

73
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,240
as does his Secretary of State,
I'm sure that Mnuchin does as well,

74
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,480
but I'm so blinded by that guy's
moviestar handsomeness

75
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,880
that I can no longer hear
anything he says.

76
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,080
Prime beef right there. Right ?
Prime. Beef. Am I right ?

77
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,000
The guy's hot. You don't mean it.

78
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,880
Thankfully Trump's move
does not instantly kill the deal.

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,160
Congress passed a law

80
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,080
where the president has to re-certify
the deal every 90 days.

81
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,720
No other nation has a requirement
like this, it is a stupid idea.

82
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,640
It goes to Congress, whose options
range from doing nothing

83
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,240
to restoring sanctions, which
could blow the whole thing up.

84
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,320
That would be insane,
because essentially everyone,

85
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,920
including the agency
who monitors this,

86
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,200
agrees that Iran
is in compliance.

87
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,400
Why is Trump doing it ?
On Wednesday he explained

88
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,880
his what we'll call "thinking".

89
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,240
It was one of the most incompetently
drawn deals I've ever seen.

90
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,720
150 billion dollars billion given,
we got nothing.

91
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,760
They got a path to nuclear
weapons very quickly.

92
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,440
One point seven billion dollars
in cash. Cash out of your pocket.

93
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,280
You know how many airplane
loads that must be ?

94
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,720
Stopping Iran getting a nuclear weapon
is not "getting nothing" !

95
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,120
It makes life on Earth safer.
As for the money,

96
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,880
we didn't "give" it to them,
it was just frozen under sanctions,

97
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,640
or it was money
that they paid us

98
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,400
for military equipment in 1979,
that we never delivered.

99
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,320
So he's wrong. He just said a string
of things factually inaccurate.

100
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,520
And you all know
what this means ? Yes !

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,440
We got him ! Yes !

102
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,520
Wait ! Stop !

103
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,280
We didn't get him !
Stop ! I just got a news alert,

104
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,560
he's still the president,
we didn't get him,

105
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,800
it turns out nothing matters,
nothing matters anymore.

106
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,800
I'm sorry. He didn't
know what he was talking about.

107
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,640
I thought that was meaningful.

108
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:14,560
The Iran deal now goes to Congress.
But they can't renegotiate it,

109
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,760
cause the deal isn't just
between the US and Iran.

110
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,760
It's between all of these parties,

111
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,240
and they have been
clear where they stand.

112
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,080
EU leaders are defending
the current agreement

113
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,280
and the UK, Germany and France
are committed to the deal as is.

114
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,600
Yeah, of course they don't
want to reopen the deal.

115
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,760
That's not how deals work.
If you buy a lamp for 40 dollars,

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,320
one person gets 40 dollars,
one person gets a lamp.

117
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,120
Also, one of you will get murdered,
but figuring out who and how

118
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,800
is the "joie de vivre"
of Craigslist !

119
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,720
As Iran's Foreign Minister
points out,

120
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,680
this decision may limit the ability
of Trump or any future presidents

121
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,280
to make deals from now on.

122
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,360
Nobody else will trust
any U.S. administration

123
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,640
to engage
in any long-term negotiation,

124
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:14,200
because the length of any commitment
from now on with any US administration

125
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,160
will be the remainder
of the term of that president.

126
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,880
And that is a huge problem.

127
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,520
Countries need to know that America
will honor its agreements,

128
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,840
if they don't, that's gonna be an issue
no matter who that next president is,

129
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,200
Warren, or President Kaine, or
more likely, President Donald, Jr.,

130
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,400
followed by President Eric,
followed by President Jared and Ivanka.

131
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,480
There is no reason to expect
that that won't happen.

132
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,480
So, this Iran deal decision is
dangerous and bizarre.

133
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,680
Trump is asking Congress to fix a deal
they don't have the ability to fix.

134
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,920
Fixes, incidentally,
that may violate the deal itself,

135
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,760
which has a process for restoring
sanctions if Iran doesn't comply.

136
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,320
Which everyone
agrees that they are doing.

137
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,080
He threatened
to pull out of the deal himself,

138
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,800
though his Secretary of State
said he wouldn't,

139
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,120
but who knows if those two
are speaking,

140
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,240
considering Tillerson called
Trump a "fucking moron"

141
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,720
and Trump publicly challenged him
to an IQ contest this week.

142
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,320
As foreign policies go,
this is incoherent.

143
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,480
You can't call it realism
or idealism or neoliberalism.

144
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,960
You can barely even call it
foreign policy.

145
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,480
The thing it's closest to

146
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,480
is a scared monkey in a submarine
randomly pushing buttons.

147
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,120
That might be fun to watch,
until it suddenly hits you:

148
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,840
"Shit, we're all on the submarine
with that fucking monkey."

149
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,840
And now this.

150
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,320
And now, it's autumn,
and that means only one thing...

151
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,200
Boy, pumpkin spice latte.

152
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,080
This is a whole season in a cup
of coffee, isn't it ?

153
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,440
Yeah !
Pumpkin spice latte !

154
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,720
It is now officially
pumpkin spice latte time.

155
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,720
Try to walk in and get a pumpkin
spice in the summer, you can't get it.

156
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,360
No, you can't !
Pumpkin spice latte !

157
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,960
The pumpkin spice latte, have you
had it ? Sent me to the moon.

158
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,480
Jim Cramer loves
pumpkin spice lattes !

159
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,480
I'm waiting for the pumpkin latte
and I'm trying to lose weight,

160
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,240
so I had to stay away from it,
the pumpkin latte.

161
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,440
Shut up ! Just drink it !
Pumpkin spice latte !

162
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,080
As soon as Starbucks has
that pumpkin spice latte, or PSL...

163
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,360
Good one, Steve !
P-S-L !

164
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,480
When they take away the pumpkin
spice latte, I cry a little.

165
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,440
Don't cry, handsome actor man !
Pumpkin spice latte will return !

166
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,360
Pumpkin spice lattes are delicious.
They seem wholesome

167
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,040
and after all, they're only
a beverage, but are they also racist ?

168
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,600
Fuck you !
Pumpkin spice latte !

169
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,960
By the way, love your
pumpkin spice latte-color...

170
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,320
I've got so much to tell you.
I've been so ahead of this curve,

171
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,640
but pumpkin latte futures are big.

172
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,560
- Is it X-rated ?
- No, it's not.

173
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,080
Wait. What ? Did he fuck a pumpkin
spice latte ? Pumpkin spice latte !

174
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,600
The bigger deal is this new maple
pecan latte. All right ?

175
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,640
So, this is gonna push
the pumpkin spice to the side.

176
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,640
Fuck maple pecan !
Pumpkin spice lattes forever !

177
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,680
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns Equifax,

178
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,360
whose name sounds
like a theatrical production

179
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,000
in which Daniel Radcliffe plays
a horse that fucks a fax machine.

180
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,000
Equifax is one of the big
three credit reporting agencies,

181
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,400
who keep financial data
on all of us,

182
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,320
so lenders and landlords can decide
whether or not we are trustworthy.

183
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,720
Equifax controls some
of our most sensitive information

184
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,880
and a month ago,
we learned this.

185
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,800
Breaking news from the credit
monitoring company Equifax.

186
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,760
Cyber thieves making off
with private information

187
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:01,600
of 143 million Americans,
nearly half the U.S. population.

188
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,160
It's actually worse,
it's now 145 million Americans.

189
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,600
The good news is that by
"private information",

190
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,160
they don't mean
your Google search history.

191
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,240
Nobody yet knows you searched
"Wario porn, parentheses 'real',"

192
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,480
or "world's richest dogs
looking for assistants"

193
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,360
or "can loneliness
cause the farts ?"

194
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,440
Bad news is, the information
they got could well be all this.

195
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,920
Your name, Social Security
number, birth date, driver's license,

196
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,600
and addresses where you lived,
information mostly permanent,

197
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,240
unless you're in federal
witness protection.

198
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,760
That does sound bad,
but here is a simple solution:

199
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,960
move 145 million people into
the witness protection program.

200
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,840
That means Joneses ?
You are the Thompsons.

201
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,680
Thompsons ? You're the Campbells.
Campbells, you're the Mendozas.

202
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,360
Mendozas, you're the Joneses.
Joneses, you shouldn't be there.

203
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,440
I made you the Thompsons !
No ! I made you the Campbells !

204
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,440
Campbells,
you're the Mendozas !

205
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,120
Mendozas, you should be living
in the Joneses' house in Phoenix !

206
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,000
I shouldn't have said Phoenix !
God, the Joneses are dead !

207
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,200
The Joneses are dead !
Forget the whole plan !

208
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,000
I was just trying to help !
I'm sorry for trying !

209
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,720
They're dead !

210
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,920
I know there might be
some younger people watching this:

211
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,320
"Who cares ? We're the first
generation to routinely send"

212
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,840
"pictures of our junk
over the Internet,"

213
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,640
"why should we care if someone
sees our Social Security numbers ?"

214
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,720
Criminals can do a lot more
with that number

215
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,080
than they can
with a picture of your dick.

216
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,800
This information's gonna be sold
on the black market.

217
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,640
People are gonna be able
to open up credit cards

218
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,960
for the rest of your life
once they have that information.

219
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,080
They can purchase
a home in your name,

220
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,720
they can open bank accounts,
take car loans.

221
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,440
Someone who has
your social security number

222
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,040
could take a job, file taxes,
even claim your kids as dependents

223
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,240
and be gone with your refund
before you file a tax return.

224
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,960
No ! The tax benefit is
the whole point of having children !

225
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,720
Without that, all you're left with
is your actual children,

226
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,440
which, you know...

227
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,920
It's a huge problem.
And in any other era,

228
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
this would've been the biggest
news story for a month,

229
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,600
but now that every day's headline
is the words

230
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,760
"everything batshit bananas again
today", it's slipped under the radar.

231
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,760
How the hell did this happen ?
Because the short answer is:

232
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,400
"the people in charge have done
literally everything wrong".

233
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,520
Let's start with the way Equifax
told us about the hack.

234
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,440
In September,
their then-CEO Rick Smith,

235
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,720
a man with a face and name so bland
he may as well be called

236
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,600
"human person" or "Frasier rerun",
he issued a taped apology,

237
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,560
but his remorse seemed
a little less than heartfelt.

238
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,400
On July 29th of this year,
we discovered that attackers gained

239
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,760
unauthorized access
to certain Equifax data files.

240
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,680
This is a disappointing event,

241
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,040
that strikes at the heart
of who we are and what we do.

242
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,680
Rick Smith is
so alarmingly mechanical,

243
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,840
you have to put him in rice
every time he gets wet.

244
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,360
He mentioned there that
Equifax learned about the breach

245
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,920
on July 29th.

246
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,840
But that video was uploaded
in September,

247
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,920
which is, and this is true,
after July.

248
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,840
Equifax knew for nearly six
weeks before telling the public.

249
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,800
They needed
that time because their investigation

250
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,840
was "complex and time consuming".

251
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,720
That's not all that happened
in that timespan.

252
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,720
Three Equifax executives sold
nearly two million dollars

253
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,120
in company stock days after
the data breach was discovered.

254
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,280
Selling stock before the public
knows there's a problem

255
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,320
looks suspicious, whether or not
you're doing something wrong.

256
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,200
It's like walking
into a petting zoo with a bib on.

257
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,960
What exactly are you planning
on messily devouring in there ?

258
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,600
Equifax defended that, saying
none of the executives in question,

259
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,280
knew about the data breach.

260
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,000
Which raises another question:
how is that even possible ?

261
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,240
Did they just ignore emails
with the subject lines, "Breach !",

262
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,040
"Following up on breach !",
"Where the fuck are you ?"

263
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,080
and "just spoke to you about breach,
and you stared blankly at me"

264
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,240
"and then said 'I'm gonna order
from that salad place'."

265
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,160
If you are getting frustrated
with this incompetence,

266
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,200
pace yourself, because
this story gets a lot worse.

267
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,440
There were multiple points where
this hack could've been prevented.

268
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,560
Equifax were alerted
by Homeland Security back in March

269
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,880
that they needed to fix
a vulnerability in their software.

270
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,520
But as lawmakers discovered,
that's not what happened.

271
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,800
There was one person
who forgot to tell somebody

272
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,080
that they had a software
that needed to be patched.

273
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,440
It is not ideal that a company
guarding such valuable information

274
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,520
leaves something that important
down to one person.

275
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,560
It's like Chase Bank has a big red
button labeled "lose everyone's money"

276
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,360
and the only thing stopping
anyone from pushing it is Frank.

277
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,160
I love Frank, I love the guy
but what if he has to pee ?

278
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,880
This is an anomaly, but Equifax
has had multiple breaches.

279
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,160
Not even counting
smaller incidents like this.

280
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,880
I checked my credit report
the other day online with Equifax.

281
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,440
Next thing I know I have 300 pieces
of mail sittin' in my mailbox.

282
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,360
Every one is addressed to her,
but they're not hers.

283
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,360
She got other
people's credit reports.

284
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,640
Now, names, social security
numbers, dates of birth,

285
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,920
current and previous addresses,
bank and loan account numbers,

286
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,240
all stacked up
on a kitchen table in Biddeford.

287
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,080
That's not great, is it ? It should've
set off red flags at Equifax

288
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,040
when hundreds of credit reports
were being mailed to the same address.

289
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,360
What did you think
had happened there ?

290
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,560
That every single fraggle
checked their credit at once,

291
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,120
down at Fraggle Rock ?

292
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,920
Down at Fraggle Rock ?
Very nice.

293
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,880
I know that other
companies have had breaches,

294
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,840
but none as damaging
as this new Equifax one.

295
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,560
This isn't Target exposing
customers' credit cards,

296
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,400
this is compromising
social security numbers,

297
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,640
thieves could use it to open
new credit cards in your name.

298
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,040
If your information was stolen,
about a 50-50 chance,

299
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,800
it could haunt you forever.

300
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,520
You don't change your birthdate,
your social security number.

301
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,720
Those who have been jeopardized
by this hack

302
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,960
will have to protect themselves
until they're dead.

303
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,720
It's true. Think about that:
there is only one other thing

304
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,320
you have to constantly protect
yourself from until you're dead.

305
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,960
And that's fucking death.

306
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,800
You would hope Equifax would do
a decent job of mitigating the damage,

307
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,360
after all, they did have nearly
six weeks to work on a response.

308
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,680
But instead,
their fuckups continued.

309
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,000
They created a website for
concerned consumers to go to,

310
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,880
but then this happened.

311
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,920
The site that Equifax started
is called Equifaxsecurity2017,

312
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,600
but a developer
named Nick Sweeting wanted

313
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,200
to show how easy it is
to create a similar, fake site,

314
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,200
so he did, he called it
SecurityEquifax2017.

315
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,000
Someone created a fake site.
And if you're thinking:

316
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,320
"who'd be dumb enough
to fall for that ?"

317
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,480
Equifax, that's who. Because
they tweeted links to that fake site

318
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,120
at least eight times.

319
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,640
Despite that site had a couple
of tiny clues that it might be fake,

320
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,400
from the headline:
"why did Equifax use a domain"

321
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,400
"that's so easily impersonated
by phishing sites ?"

322
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,120
To the fact that, when you clicked
on their "FAQ", this happened.

323
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,520
Well-played, pranksters.
You have my respect.

324
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,520
Equifax says that they
are tightening up their operation.

325
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:23,680
You can just go to
Equifaxfraudprevention.com.

326
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,960
Not because it's their site,
but because it's our site.

327
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,040
We bought it two days ago.
You'll find the message:

328
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,400
"How were we still able to do this ?
Why haven't you learned anything ?"

329
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,360
There is even more.

330
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,360
Equifax also offered consumers
a year of free credit monitoring.

331
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,880
When people tried to sign up,
they noticed something.

332
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,560
You lock into Equifax's terms
of service when you sign up for it,

333
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,080
which means that
you can't sue the company.

334
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,440
You resolve disputes
in forced arbitration.

335
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,920
You'd be giving up
your right to sue, so legally,

336
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,240
your best recourse at that point
would be shaking your fist

337
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,240
while shouting "Equifax" !

338
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,520
They've since rescinded
that clause.

339
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,280
Many are signing up for third-party
credit monitoring services,

340
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,320
like LifeLock, who've been
advertising everywhere,

341
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,800
and they have seen a surge
in business.

342
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,720
If you are considering LifeLock
because you are mad at Equifax,

343
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,120
it's something
you're gonna need to know.

344
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,440
According to filings with the SEC,

345
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,080
LifeLock purchases credit
monitoring services from Equifax.

346
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,200
That means someone buys credit
monitoring through LifeLock,

347
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,760
LifeLock turns around
and passes some of that revenue

348
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,040
directly along to Equifax.

349
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,680
- Is that right, Mr. Smith ?
- That is correct.

350
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,080
It's true. Some of the money
that you pay to LifeLock

351
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,840
goes right back to Equifax,
which could only be more infuriating

352
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,200
if you then found out that the rest
goes to Toys for Todds,

353
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,120
a charity that purchases sex
toys for grown men named Todd.

354
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,400
Buy your own sex toys, Todd,
we can't carry you on this one.

355
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,000
Equifax connections aside,
LifeLock had repeated issues itself,

356
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,280
including settlements
with the FTC

357
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,600
and a truly disastrous
ad campaign a few years back.

358
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,080
I'm Todd Davis
and I'm here to prove

359
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,320
how safe your identity
can be with LifeLock.

360
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,080
That's my real
social security number.

361
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,120
LifeLock's then-CEO,
Todd Davis,

362
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,440
put his real social security number,
457-55-5462,

363
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,080
on a truck and billboards.

364
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,960
For a time, it was impossible
to escape his number,

365
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,120
457-55-5462.

366
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,000
And that was
a very cocky move

367
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,360
and one that resulted in him
having his identity stolen 13 times.

368
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,880
I'm guessing that the defense
for the people who took it was:

369
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,720
"I didn't steal his identity,"

370
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,360
"I literally got it
off the back of a truck."

371
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,440
LifeLock may not be your best
solution to the Equifax crisis.

372
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,760
Which brings us to the question:
what is ?

373
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,000
Consumer advocates told us
the step everyone should take

374
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,120
is go to all three large
credit-reporting companies,

375
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,720
Equifax, Experian and TransUnion
and freeze your credit.

376
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,880
That way, no one can access it,
including you,  until you un-freeze it.

377
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,320
The companies offer their
own credit-protection products,

378
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,360
with names like "Trusted ID",
or "Credit Lock Plus",

379
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,320
but they are more expensive and
offer fewer consumer protections.

380
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,040
If you need to remember this,
locks are something you don't want.

381
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,280
Think of
Justin Bieber's dreadlocks.

382
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,400
A terrible decision, to be avoided.
Whereas freezes are great.

383
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,760
Think of this tiny penguin
losing its frozen mind.

384
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,760
See ?
So, to recap: locks ?

385
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,320
Freezes ?

386
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,440
Here's the thing on this:
freezing and unfreezing your credit

387
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,040
can cost money, which will
go back to these companies.

388
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,120
Seemingly, they just can't
fucking lose on this.

389
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,920
On the same day that Congress
was yelling at Equifax's former CEO,

390
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,720
it emerged that the company
had just been awarded

391
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,680
a $7 million contract
by the IRS to prevent fraud.

392
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,400
Which led one senator to make
a brutal comparison.

393
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,440
You realize to many
Americans right now that looks like

394
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,240
we're giving Lindsay Lohan
the keys to the minibar ?

395
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,480
I understand your point.

396
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,440
That was the pause
of a man thinking:

397
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,800
"do I let that pass,"

398
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,440
"do I correct him
on how to pronounce Lohan,"

399
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,800
"or I pronounce her name
Lingonberry Lohoneybaloney" ?

400
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,080
You should know:
that IRS deal has been suspended.

401
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,080
Not canceled, just suspended.
That might make you angry.

402
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,360
That anger won't have much
impact on Equifax,

403
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,960
they make most of their money
selling our data to businesses.

404
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,640
In their eyes, we're not the
consumer, we're the product.

405
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,120
In terms of KFC, we're not
the guy buying the ten-piece buckets,

406
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,960
we're the fucking chickens.

407
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,240
Businesses are the only ones who
can exert influence here.

408
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,960
As one colorfully-dressed
expert pointed out,

409
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,760
that's not gonna happen soon.

410
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,240
I haven't heard any big
company come out yet and say

411
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,880
we're not going to use Equifax
anymore for their credit scores.

412
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,480
Everybody's quiet, I don't know
what they're waiting to hear.

413
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,520
They should be done. But, because
it's America they'll be okay.

414
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,600
That angry, business-casual
farm animal on Fox Business

415
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,080
is talking sense.

416
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,600
That sentence alone shows
just how bad things are.

417
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,720
There should clearly be major
reform to this industry.

418
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,240
But that is going to take time.
So until then,

419
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,240
freeze your credit reports
with all three of these companies

420
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,480
and only un-freeze them when
you need to apply for credit.

421
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,880
Because the freeze option can be
hard to find on their sites,

422
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,320
if you go to our Twitter feed,
we will give you the exact links.

423
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,560
They will give you a PIN number
you need to un-freeze it,

424
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,240
so do not lose that number,
or make it something memorable,

425
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,120
like 457-55-5462.

426
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,360
But not that.
Because of course,

427
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,240
that's Todd Davis's social
security number.

428
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,200
And now, this.

429
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,440
New York City mayoral
candidate Bo Dietl

430
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,000
makes a splash
at this week's debate.

431
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,320
One minute opening
statements, with Bo Dietl.

432
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,440
First of all, go Yankees !

433
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,000
I was mobbed 500 times,
I was stabbed, I was shot at,

434
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,840
hospitalized 30 times.

435
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,960
What'd you make last year ?
I made $1.8 million, ok ?

436
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,000
If I had my head
in a potato field,

437
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,600
but I popped it out
and listened to this mayor,

438
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,920
I'd vote for him too.

439
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,520
He hired that Ponte, from Maine.
He was guarding mooses.

440
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,640
Mr. Dietl,
we're going to you first.

441
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,640
I haven't
asked the question yet.

442
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,680
I'd like to go to Riker's Island
with the Mayor. Me and you.

443
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,560
This is just one of the issues
in which our Mayor has.

444
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,760
What is that wall against Gracie
Mansion ? Is it the Berlin wall ?

445
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,280
We're going to cut your mic
off if you don't follow the rules.

446
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,840
My question is to
the assembly member.

447
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,600
- Wha' 'bout me ?
- Sorry, I get only one.

448
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,520
I cut off your mic,
because you keep interrupting

449
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,280
and we'll do it again
if you continue.

450
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,760
You said that a quote:
"Muslim guy who works for the state"

451
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,800
"was to blame
for your problems."

452
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,440
You referred to your attorney
as my quote: "Jewish lawyer",

453
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,240
and you said that you knew
you had lost your court battle

454
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,600
because the African American
judge you said

455
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,080
"looked like Bill de Blasio's wife,
Chirlane McCray."

456
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,160
You're wrong on that,
what you just said.

457
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,440
What was I wrong on ?

458
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,120
Was very familiar
looking as the mayor's wife,

459
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,240
with two beautiful eyes
and a smile.

460
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,680
I never used the word
African American.

461
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,760
Yeah, just turn off the mic.
Thanks for watching.

462
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,440
Please vote next month,
have a great evening.

463
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,280
That's our show.
We're off next week,

464
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,840
good night !

465
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,120
Pumpkin spice latte !

466
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,080
END OF EPISODE 27,
SEASON IV
