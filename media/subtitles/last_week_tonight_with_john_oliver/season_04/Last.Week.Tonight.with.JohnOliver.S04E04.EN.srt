00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,640
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,040
SEASON IV, EPISODE 4

3
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,640
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,720
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

5
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,440
And we begin this evening
with President Trump.

6
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,440
Two words that still simply
do not belong together,

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,760
like baby pubes
or haunted horse.

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,120
This week the president
addressed congress

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,880
with what appeared to be
a more disciplined tone.

10
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,000
The time for small thinking is over.

11
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,240
The time
for trivial fights is behind us.

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,880
Ok, here's the thing about that.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,560
That's supposed to be
a reassuring statement,

14
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,200
but it could go either way.

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,160
Time for trivial fights is behind us.
The time for major fights is here.

16
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,920
Which is why I am launching
a full-scale invasion of Australia.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,080
Who's with me ?

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,080
The speech got rave reviews
and for almost 24 hours,

19
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,920
seemed the White House might
be getting on track.

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,400
Until this happened:

21
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,880
Washington Post reporting that
Attorney General Jeff Sessions

22
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,600
when he was still a senator and
an adviser to the Trump campaign

23
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,640
had meetings
with Russia's Ambassador

24
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,480
but did not disclose them
during his confirmation hearings.

25
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,720
Jeff Sessions, Trump's attorney general
and the unfortunate result

26
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,360
of Dobby the house elf's one
night stand with a confederate flag

27
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,800
got in trouble this week

28
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,080
for undisclosed meetings
with Russia's Ambassador.

29
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,000
Something, which in itself,
is not against the law.

30
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,840
Sessions' confirmation
hearing featured this exchange.

31
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,480
If there is any evidence that anyone
affiliated with the Trump campaign

32
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,280
communicated with the Russian
government in this campaign,

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,520
what will you do ?

34
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,600
Senator Franken, I'm not aware
of any of those activities.

35
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,240
I have been called a surrogate
at a time or two in that campaign

36
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,200
and I didn't have communications
with the Russians

37
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,760
and I'm unable to comment.

38
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,440
There is an obvious problem:
what he just said is not true.

39
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,440
The weirder thing is
that was an unforced error.

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,720
He wasn't even asked whether
he'd met with the Russians.

41
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,160
He implicated
himself out of the blue.

42
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,040
Which should have been
immediately suspicious.

43
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,440
If you ask how your
weekend was and they say:

44
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,080
"I wasn't masturbating into
the Slurpee machine at the 7-11,"

45
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,040
you check the security cameras at
the 7-11 and you don't act surprised.

46
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,320
You can sort of tell that
Sessions knew he'd fucked up,

47
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,960
because watch his expression
afterward.

48
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,160
I didn't have communications
with the Russians

49
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,840
and I'm unable
to comment on it.

50
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,200
Very well.
Without divulging sensitive...

51
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,520
He looked right at the camera.

52
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,280
He looks like he's about to loosen his
collar and audibly say the word "gulp."

53
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,760
Sessions recused himself from
investigating anything to do

54
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,080
with Russia and Trump campaign,
but it might not be enough.

55
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,800
There are multiple
calls for his resignation,

56
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,560
the most forceful
was a damning tweet that read:

57
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,160
"that's not good enough.
You need to resign"

58
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,480
posted by the band Smash Mouth.

59
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,000
You know what they say:
as goes Smash Mouth,

60
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,640
so goes about 8 000 people, tops.

61
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,360
It wasn't just Sessions meeting
with Russian officials last year.

62
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,240
Trump campaign operatives,
including J.D. Gordon and Carter Page,

63
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,760
met with the Russian Ambassador,
as did Jared Kushner.

64
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,360
Nothing inherently wrong there.
But it doesn't look great that

65
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,400
every time Trump associates
are asked about Russia,

66
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,400
they respond like they're
trying to hide something.

67
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,480
Watch former policy advisor
Carter Page on Thursday.

68
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,000
Did you meet Sergey Kislyak
in Cleveland, did you talk to him ?

69
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,760
- I'm not gonna deny that.
- So you did talk to him !

70
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,520
I never met him anywhere
outside of Cleveland.

71
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,240
The only time that
you met him was in Cleveland ?

72
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,120
I may have met him, possibly,
it might have been in Cleveland.

73
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,720
Cleveland is more of a state
of mind than a physical place !

74
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,840
When I need to delay an orgasm,
I "go to Cleveland" in my mind.

75
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,480
Sometimes I meet Sergey Kislyak
there. Does that count ?

76
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,800
Am I still talking ?

77
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,480
A pattern of suspicious responses
you trace back to last summer,

78
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,120
when Paul Manafort, Trump's
then-campaign manager, did this.

79
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,640
Trump has no financial relationships
with any Russian oligarchs.

80
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,080
That's what he said.

81
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,720
That's what I said, that's
obviously what our position is.

82
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,960
Holy shit.
That was so unconvincing,

83
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,320
it probably set off an
unplugged polygraph machine.

84
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,520
Sarge,
I went in to get some paper clips

85
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
and the needle
was just going crazy.

86
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,680
It is not clear
what is really going on here yet.

87
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,680
One possibility is that this amounts
to what I'll call "stupid Watergate":

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,160
a potential scandal with
all the intrigue of Watergate,

89
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,440
except everyone involved is
really bad at everything,

90
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,560
and the relevant question isn't: "what
did the president know and when ?"

91
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,720
as it is: "is the President physically
capable of knowing things at all ?"

92
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,920
Yesterday, he decided this was the best
way to dispel everyone's suspicions.

93
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,840
It was before sunrise in Palm Beach,
when the president of the US

94
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,600
took to Twitter to make one
of his most stunning accusations ever.

95
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,280
"Terrible. Just found out that Obama
had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower"

96
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,720
"just before the victory,
nothing found."

97
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,640
Followed by four more outbursts
taking on Obama and misspelling tap.

98
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Let me give you some context
for where we are:

99
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,360
in 1992, Dan Quayle
misspelled "potato"

100
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,320
and it became one of the most famous
dumb moments in political history.

101
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,880
Now the President is so busy hurling
conspiracy theories around

102
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,960
we can't even pause to enjoy
the fact he misspelled the word "tap".

103
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,560
And his evidence for suggesting Obama
committed a crime seems pretty thin.

104
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,720
The president cited no proof,
it is not clear tonight

105
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,720
whether he based his allegations
on a top secret White House briefing.

106
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,160
Or whether it came from reading
an article on the Breitbart website,

107
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,680
that detailed speculation

108
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,760
from a conspiracy-loving
talk show host, Mark Levin.

109
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,760
We can now declare Trump has a worse
media diet than the Son of Sam Killer

110
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,880
and he got all his news from a talking
dog who told him to murder.

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,280
Rather than providing evidence
to support the accusation,

112
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,760
the White House urged
congress to look into the allegations.

113
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,840
It seems odd that a president
would issue a firm statement of fact,

114
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,520
and then launch an investigation
to try and support that claim,

115
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,720
something pointed out
to a White House spokesperson.

116
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,880
The President of the United States

117
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,960
is accusing the former president
of wiretapping him.

118
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,640
I think that this is again,
something that if this happened.

119
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,600
If... Why is the president
saying it did happen ?

120
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,800
He's going off of information that
he's seen that has led him to believe

121
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,040
that this is a very real potential.

122
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,280
Let's break that down. She "thinks"
the president saw information

123
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,640
that led him to "believe"
that this is a real "potential".

124
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,240
I guess this is just how
things are going to work now.

125
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,880
The president once saw a banana
with a bruise

126
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,120
that looked like a picture
in an article he read in a dream

127
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,320
and that is why
we're at fucking war.

128
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:31,080
Deep down we probably knew
this week would end this way.

129
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,560
And if you need proof of that,
just look at Paul Ryan's face

130
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,240
immediately after Trump made
his call for an end to triviality.

131
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,320
The time for trivial fights
is behind us.

132
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,000
We just need the courage to share
the dreams that fill our hearts.

133
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,560
That is the face of a man thinking
"don't laugh, he's the President."

134
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,160
Which incidentally should now be
the official slogan of the Republicans.

135
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,040
And now, this.

136
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,360
Does anyone know
if CNN's Brooke Baldwin

137
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,520
would consider herself a nerd ?

138
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,240
All right,
my fellow pop culture nerds.

139
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,880
All right, you Apple nerds,
myself included.

140
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,920
Here's how big of a nerd I am.
All of us political nerds.

141
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,840
I was a huge nerd
and watched the entire last debate.

142
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,520
Kinda put on my news nerd hat.
I'm a bit of a word nerd.

143
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,880
I was a bit of a Shakespeare nerd.
Big music nerd.

144
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,800
Wanted to have a geek out moment.

145
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,800
I'm an archaeology geek.
A self-professed geek myself.

146
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,040
Thank you for allowing me
to get my Supreme Court geek on.

147
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,440
As a huge space geek.
All right, my fellow space geeks.

148
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,440
All right, my fellow space nerds.
Thank you, my fellow space nerd.

149
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,600
I'm a bit of a nerd
about these things.

150
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,040
Are you geeking out like me ?
Is this not amazing ?

151
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,640
Thank you for having a nerd moment
with me here live on CNN.

152
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,840
Moving on. For our main story tonight,
we'd like to talk about

153
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,560
someone you may not have thought
about for a while: the Dalai Lama.

154
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,840
A man so enlightened he's basically
the original woke bae.

155
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,440
According to a Gallup Poll,

156
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,720
the Dalai Lama is the sixth
most admired man in America.

157
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,720
When you mention his name,
you can see how widely he's revered.

158
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,800
Lotta respect,
inspiration for what he says.

159
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,560
He says a lot of good quotes.

160
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,680
He has some great quotes about life.

161
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,360
He said
a lot of good things.

162
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,000
I guess he's a peaceful man.

163
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,280
He's about peace.

164
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,880
So, he's peaceful, admired
and has some good quotes.

165
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,120
That is pretty broad. They could be
describing either the Dalai Lama

166
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,640
or Matthew McConaughey.

167
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,040
Watch what happens when those
people are asked a simple follow-up:

168
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,520
What would you say
the Dalai Lama does ?

169
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,440
I have no idea,
I'm not even gonna lie.

170
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,800
I'm not really sure.

171
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,320
He's a very important figure
for Hinduism ?

172
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,200
- He's a Buddhist god, right ?
- He's a real person.

173
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,760
- He's alive.
- Shit.

174
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,560
He just said: "oh shit" like
he owes the Dalai Lama money.

175
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,400
He's alive ? Shit ! I gotta disappear.
That guy does not fuck around.

176
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,720
The Chinese government
have a very different view:

177
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,160
instead of vaguely loving
the Dalai Lama,

178
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,160
they very specifically hate him.

179
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,200
They've referred to him
as "a wolf in monk's robes",

180
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,920
and have banned his image.

181
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,920
They've retaliated against Americans
for even meeting with him.

182
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,400
Britain's Guardian says China
reportedly banned Lady Gaga,

183
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,800
because she met with the Dalai Lama
to discuss yoga.

184
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,240
Not only is it incredible
they banned her for that.

185
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,560
It's incredible
that event happened.

186
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,960
Lady Gaga was with the Dalai Lama
in Indianapolis discussing yoga.

187
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,400
Slightly less ridiculous than
Elton John meeting Ben Bernanke

188
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,720
on Easter Island
to talk about Roombas.

189
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,720
The Chinese government's hatred
stems from its desire to control Tibet,

190
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,840
a region in southwest China.

191
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,040
Tibet was something of a celebrity
cause in the 1990s,

192
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,680
there were Tibetan Freedom concerts

193
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,480
and Richard Gere
brought it up at the Oscars.

194
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,080
I was wondering
what this kind of...

195
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,080
If something miraculous and kind
of movie-like could happen here,

196
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,360
where we could all kind of send
love and truth and kind of sanity

197
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,720
to Deng Xiaoping
right now in Beijing.

198
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,760
That he will take his troops and
take the Chinese away from Tibet

199
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,480
and allow these people to live
as free, independent people again.

200
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:52,160
We send this thought,
send this thought out...

201
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,720
We send this thought,
we send it out right now...

202
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,920
I'm sorry,
there's been a mistake.

203
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,000
The thoughts are supposed to be
sent to the producers of "Moonlight".

204
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,280
This is not a joke. Moonlight !
These thoughts are for you !

205
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,840
There's been a horrible mistake.
Moonlight, take the thoughts.

206
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,160
There is a lot about Tibet
that you might not actually know.

207
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,480
It's larger than you probably think.
China say it's this area

208
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,240
but Tibetan exiles will say
it's even larger,

209
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,480
encompassing an area that
is roughly a quarter of China.

210
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,680
So it's very big,
in a confusing way,

211
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,200
also how director Lars Von Trier
characterized Willem Dafoe's dick.

212
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:40,040
He told reporters: "Too big. Everybody
got confused when they saw it."

213
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Tibet is the Willem Dafoe's dick
of planet Earth. Surprisingly large.

214
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,480
The point is,
China invaded Tibet in 1950,

215
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,480
and imposed strict controls on
the institutions of Tibetan Buddhism.

216
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,160
Temples have been destroyed

217
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,360
and hundreds of thousands
of Tibetans have been killed.

218
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,160
When Freedom House scored

219
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,120
countries and territories for
political rights and civil liberties,

220
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,040
Tibet came in second-worst
behind Syria

221
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,320
and ahead of both Somalia
and North Korea.

222
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,120
The whole territory is
a gross human rights violation,

223
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,640
another way that Lars Von Trier
described Willem Dafoe's penis.

224
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,520
The clearest sign of just how bad
conditions are is the fact that,

225
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,240
since early 2009, 146 Tibetans
self-immolated in Tibet and China,

226
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,840
setting themselves
on fire in protest.

227
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,440
To which the Chinese police have been
less than sympathetic.

228
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,960
When Lobsang was on fire,
Chinese police came

229
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,760
and they caught him
and beat him.

230
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,360
Because Lobsang was on fire,
the police's clothes caught on fire.

231
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,000
So later, the police
are demanding Lobsang's family

232
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,680
that they need compensation
for the burning of their own clothes.

233
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,320
Every part of that is horrifying.

234
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,960
And China is unlikely
to loosen its grip on the region.

235
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,800
Tibet has rich resources,
from gold and lithium,

236
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,080
to rivers supplying hydroelectric power
and water to over a billion people.

237
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,840
They are very sensitive to any
perceived threat to their control,

238
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,280
which brings us back
to the Dalai Lama.

239
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,240
He's been both a spiritual and
political leader of Tibetan Buddhists,

240
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,560
a cross between
a Pope and a president.

241
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,480
A "Popesident," if you will.
But you shouldn't, so please don't.

242
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,560
China has done everything over
the years to diminish his power.

243
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,880
He even fled Tibet in 1959,
under fear of arrest,

244
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,080
an escape that was reported

245
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,440
by the most British man
who has ever lived.

246
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,480
The young Dalai Lama, revered by
his people as a living Buddha,

247
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,960
was reported under arrest
by the Reds.

248
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,000
But, according to other sources,
is safely in hiding.

249
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,920
Red tyranny is not wanted
by these intensely religious people.

250
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,400
Yes, damn that unwanted
creeping Red tyranny !

251
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,880
Down with those
thieving imperialists !

252
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,560
And good night to her majesty's
subjects in Bahrain, Maldives,

253
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,800
Rhodesia, Jamaica, Barbados,
Kenya and Uganda.

254
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,360
Nighty-night. Sleepytight.

255
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:26,440
For over 50 years, the Dalai Lama
has lived in exile in India.

256
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,240
And he's lived quite a life. He's met
with the last four presidents.

257
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,800
When he was a child,
FDR gave him a beautiful

258
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,320
Patek Philippe pocket-watch,
which he still has to this day.

259
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,880
George W. Bush gave him an even
greater gift by painting his portrait.

260
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,600
This portrait.

261
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,560
I'd give Bush's skills as an artist

262
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,560
the same review I give his time as
president: not bad for a five year old.

263
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,840
Dalai Lama officially stepped down

264
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,080
from running the Tibetan government
in exile in 2011.

265
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,480
But he is still of profound importance
to the Tibetan people

266
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,960
as a spiritual leader
and as a figurehead.

267
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,240
Here is where
this story gets absolutely amazing.

268
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:10,240
He's 81 years old. So thoughts have
turned to his next reincarnation.

269
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,520
It turns out, there's a bit
of a problem with that.

270
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,120
Broadly speaking,
when the Dalai Lama dies,

271
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,280
he reincarnates
as a child somewhere on Earth.

272
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:25,280
A key person in the process of finding
him is the Panchen Lama.

273
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,120
When the Panchen Lama dies,
Dalai Lama plays a similar role

274
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,960
in finding him and so on.

275
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,360
They're playing
a Buddhist version of hide-and-seek.

276
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,800
The ninth Panchen Lama helped
identify the current Dalai Lama,

277
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,120
who in turn, identified this six-year
old boy as the Panchen Lama.

278
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,080
It gets tricky because that boy has
not been seen in more than 20 years.

279
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,760
These are the last known pictures
of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima,

280
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,720
the boy chosen
to be Panchen Lama.

281
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,560
Chinese authorities rejected
his appointment,

282
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,480
arrested the boy and his family.

283
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,960
China kidnapped a six-year-old,
and no one has heard from him,

284
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,400
although just two years ago,
a senior Chinese official said:

285
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,000
he is being "educated,
living a normal life,"

286
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,240
"growing up healthily and
does not wish to be disturbed."

287
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,440
Sounds like the kind of thing a
former child star's publicist

288
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,160
would scream into a phone:

289
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,160
"She's growing up healthy,
living a normal life."

290
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,600
Those track marks on her arms
are where they inject vitamins.

291
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,560
She's fine.

292
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,520
China didn't stop at just
stealing the Panchen Lama.

293
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,880
They had another trick
up their sleeve.

294
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
In an attempt to discredit
the Dalai Lama's choice,

295
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,360
Chinese officials used a 200-year-old
ceremony to name their Panchen Lama.

296
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,800
Yes ! They made
their own fake Panchen Lama !

297
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,080
They counterfeited a religious
leader like a knockoff handbag.

298
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,280
That doesn't say "Coach".
That says "Cough !"

299
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,400
China's tactics here are obvious:
if they control the Panchen Lama,

300
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,360
they can use him to pick
a new Dalai Lama who might,

301
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,320
coincidentally, be very favorable
to the Chinese government.

302
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,920
Meanwhile, the Dalai Lama
is pretty pissed off about this.

303
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,960
One thing that I want to make clear,

304
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,840
that as far
as my own rebirth is concerned,

305
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,160
the final authority is myself.

306
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,280
No one else. And obviously,
not Chinese Communists.

307
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,080
That is some forceful language too.
He's basically saying:

308
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,920
"They can make that decision
over my dead body",

309
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,400
except specifically not that.

310
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,720
He's now saying that he will either
not reincarnate as the Dalai Lama

311
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,440
or, if he does, it won't be inside
Chinese-controlled Tibet.

312
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:59,720
When he dies, we could plausibly
wind up with two rival Dalai Lamas

313
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,840
and the already fraught situation
in Tibet could spiral out of control.

314
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,160
There is only one person
who can fill you in

315
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,040
on what is happening
in the Dalai Lama's head,

316
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,160
but he lives in India, and
that is a 14-hour flight away.

317
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,920
I went to speak to the Dalai Lama
in India. Enjoy.

318
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,960
I traveled to the Himalayan
foothills of Dharamsala, India,

319
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,080
a journey that involved
more uphill walking, cows

320
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,840
and monkey traffic
than I'd been led to believe.

321
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,040
All to talk with the Dalai Lama
about China, conditions in Tibet

322
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,680
and what comes next for him.

323
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,640
Your Holiness, it is
an honor to speak to you.

324
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,320
- May I say, "tashi delek".
- Tashi delek. Thank you.

325
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,480
- How is my pronunciation ?
- I think very good.

326
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,720
I just started learning Tibetan
40 seconds ago.

327
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,680
Let's talk about China,

328
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,000
because the Chinese government
absolutely hates you, don't they ?

329
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,320
Yes.

330
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,000
One government official said you're
a wolf wrapped in monk's robes.

331
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,320
And photos of you
are forbidden in many places.

332
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,200
You don't, to me,
look like an evil wolf.

333
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,600
- They describe me as a demon.
- You're a demon. Yeah.

334
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,960
Then, I immediately reacted yes,
I am demon, with horn.

335
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,880
- That's the classic demon, right ?
- Yes.

336
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,600
When they look at you,
that's what they see.

337
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,320
Whatever they want to say,
that is their freedom.

338
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:41,960
I have no negative feeling.
I just feel love, like that.

339
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,640
I practice, you see,
taking others' anger, suspicion,

340
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:54,840
distrust and give them patience,
tolerance and compassion.

341
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,040
I practice that.

342
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,240
It seems the Chinese government
are particularly good

343
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,720
at taking your positivity,
turning it back into negativity

344
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,240
and oppression of the Tibetan people,
and they hand it back to you.

345
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,400
Outside the Dalai Lama's temple
is a local memorial,

346
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,680
honoring Tibetans who've
self-immolated in protest,

347
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,360
acts that put him
in a very difficult position.

348
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,880
This is a hard question.
The self-immolation that has happened,

349
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,800
140 Tibetans have burned themselves,
it is very sad.

350
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,040
Indeed, yes.

351
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:39,160
Why is it hard to definitively
tell them to stop doing it ?

352
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,160
This is, I find,
very difficult sort of situation.

353
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,680
That right from the beginning,
when I first heard that,

354
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,920
firstly I expressed
my sort of sadness.

355
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,880
Meantime,
if I say their action is wrong,

356
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,240
then their family,
they feel very sad.

357
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:06,920
One of their family member did
something against Dalai Lama's wish.

358
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:12,040
I don't want to create that.
Then suddenly I cannot support that.

359
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:18,080
Act of killing, from Buddhist
viewpoint, self-killing not good.

360
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,440
So therefore,
my position is very difficult.

361
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,160
So then, best thing
is remain silence, keep quiet.

362
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,480
The Dalai Lama is painfully aware
how powerful his words are

363
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,480
and he uses them in targeted
and surprisingly specific ways,

364
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,680
like this example, which he offered up
out of nowhere.

365
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,960
One of my previous visit Mongolia,

366
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,360
they took lot of vodka,
the Russian sort of hard...

367
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,120
They like a drink. Yeah, vodka.

368
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,040
Then, I suggested drink
much less vodka.

369
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,520
They love to hear that.

370
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,880
Instead of that, traditional sort
of drink, horse milk.

371
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,240
- Wait, hold on.
- Horse milk.

372
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,960
You tried to wean them off vodka
by giving them horse milk.

373
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,120
- Yes. Then, they follow.
- What ?

374
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,760
They really follow.
Since then, you see,

375
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,000
I think majority of Mongolian
no longer any drink.

376
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,440
Hold on, that is a huge claim.
You cured Mongolia of alcoholism.

377
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,280
- Using horse milk.
- Yes.

378
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,160
Yeah, not to labor the point,
I'm just concerned.

379
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,120
I would see horse milk and I'd think
that came from a horse.

380
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:42,240
That's illogical. What's differences,
cow milk and horse milk ?

381
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,440
One comes out of a cow,

382
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,360
the other I don't know how
you get it out of a horse.

383
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,400
We were having fun and I knew
how to keep the party going.

384
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,680
Let's talk about a lighter subject:
death.

385
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,600
You are going to die and when you do,
it's going to be a massive problem,

386
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,360
because there are issues regarding
your reincarnation regarding China.

387
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,680
I do not much
concern about that.

388
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,280
My main concern is wellbeing
of seven billion human being,

389
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,480
and then preservation
of rich Buddhist tradition.

390
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,480
- Which we kept.
- You're intertwined with that.

391
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,800
You see, individual person,
not much important.

392
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,400
But you're the Dalai Lama.

393
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,600
Buddhism over 2 600 years
still very much alive.

394
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,360
So, do you think you might be
the last Dalai Lama ?

395
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,000
- Very possible.
- You do ?

396
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,040
- Yes.
- You might be it ?

397
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,440
If I become last Dalai Lama,
I feel very happy.

398
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,120
- Because you were a good one ?
- I may say, quite intelligent.

399
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,160
You're calling yourself intelligent ?
A little bit of arrogance there.

400
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,800
But if you don't resolve
your reincarnation issue,

401
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,080
are you not worried that China
will appoint their own Dalai Lama

402
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,400
and he may not speak
like you're speaking now ?

403
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,960
That also, may I say so...
That's also one of the foolish act.

404
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,520
- Short-sighted.
- China ?

405
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,200
Without using human brain
properly. It's harmful.

406
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,200
That is a guaranteed way to calm
the Chinese government,

407
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,360
to tell them they're not using
the human brain properly.

408
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:42,480
I told them, our brain have
the ability to create common sense.

409
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,600
The Chinese hardliners,
that part of brain is missing.

410
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,880
I think the Chinese leaders,
Chinese Communists,

411
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,760
they are concerned
about image of China.

412
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,880
I'm happy to sit here
and criticize China with you,

413
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,160
because the consequences for me are
not as bad as they are for you.

414
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:14,440
They call me demon.
So I want another demon.

415
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,200
So you become demon.

416
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,320
No, you can't transfer, you can't
reincarnate the demon into me.

417
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,720
- Yes.
- No, don't make me a demon.

418
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,160
No, you can't do it.
Can he do that ?

419
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,520
- As I mentioned, you see...
- No.

420
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,440
This is not how I wanted
this interview to go.

421
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,560
Dalai Lama seems determined to keep
his reincarnation plans private,

422
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,760
leaving millions of Tibetans
waiting for an answer,

423
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,680
and as our time drew to a close,
I wanted to cement our friendship.

424
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,400
You were given a watch by
President Roosevelt, is that true ?

425
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,680
Yes. True. At that time,
I think one Patek Philippe.

426
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,880
- Patek Phillippe, a beautiful watch.
- Pocket watch.

427
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,880
I have a special gift for you. Not
a beautiful watch from a president,

428
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,920
but it is a special watch
from me.

429
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:14,920
Here it is. It's a calculator watch.
Right ?

430
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,840
Roosevelt may have given you a fancy
watch, but that is water resistant.

431
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,640
Wonderful. Thank you.
Roosevelt watch I think old-fashioned.

432
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,320
This new-fashion.

433
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,200
Not so much
new-fashioned as from the 1980s.

434
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,080
Thank you so much.

435
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,680
Thank you, my demon friend.
It was an honor.

436
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,200
That's our show, thanks for watching.
See you next week, good night !

437
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,720
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

438
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,040
END OF EPISODE 4,
SEASON IV
