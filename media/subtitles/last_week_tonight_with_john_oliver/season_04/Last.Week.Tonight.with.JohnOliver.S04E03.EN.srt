00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,080
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,080
SEASON IV
EPISODE 3

3
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,000
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,200
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,520
Unfortunately we must begin, again,
with President Trump.

6
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,800
Two words that continue
to sound unnatural together

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,760
like walrus porn
or Tilda Swinton.

8
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,440
Trump visited the Museum of African
American History and Culture,

9
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,760
promising to unite
a divided country.

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,280
If you didn't hear that,

11
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,360
it's because it happened on
the same day he did this.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,320
Trump administration laying out plans
to crack down on illegal immigration,

13
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,880
sparking a steep increase
in deportations

14
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,440
and stoking fears
among immigrants.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,800
That's upsetting,
even by Trump's standards.

16
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,600
Normally, when he wants
to terrify an immigrant,

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,920
he texts Melania:
"coming home early. Feeling horny."

18
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,280
This new plan gives ICE agents
much greater latitude

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,280
in who they can pursue
and deport.

20
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,280
It includes hiring 15 000 new
border patrol and immigration officers.

21
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,880
Which might be difficult,
as they've already had so much trouble

22
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,240
finding qualified applicants,
there are 2 000 vacancies.

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,200
Seems immigration agent
is the hardest job to fill,

24
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,960
after personal assistant
to Mariah Carey.

25
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,800
I want a limo for my dog and mirrors
that make me look like it's 1997.

26
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,200
Go get me them.

27
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,880
Many people were alarmed,
and it didn't help

28
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,480
when the president seemed
to escalate the stakes out of nowhere.

29
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,920
We're getting bad dudes
out of this country

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,480
and at a rate
that nobody's ever seen before.

31
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,840
And they're the bad ones.
It's a military operation.

32
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,520
First, please stop using
the phrase "bad dudes".

33
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,000
You're trying
to wean yourself off "bad hombres",

34
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,280
but it still feels like
a lateral move.

35
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,360
What was that you said
about a military operation ?

36
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,520
That is a casual way to mention
you've deployed the armed forces.

37
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,440
Actress Melissa McCarthy was on hand
to set the record straight,

38
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,040
with the world's
least convincing explanation.

39
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,160
President used it as an adjective.
It happens with precision.

40
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,160
Okay, Mel, but presidents need to be
precise with language.

41
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,600
When commander in chief,

42
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,360
term "military operation"
has consequences.

43
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,400
It's not just a meaningless word
you can throw around,

44
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,480
like "consultant"
or "superfood".

45
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,760
Please, don't think that Trump just
went after immigrants this week.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,800
He targeted children, too.

47
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,080
Schools and students
are facing uncertainty

48
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,600
after Trump
withdrew federal guidance

49
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,400
on transgender bathroom use
in public schools.

50
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,280
Trump is delivering on his promise
to

51
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,040
"Make Entire Subsets
Of The American Citizenry"

52
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,160
"Concerned About Their Safety
And Well-Being Again !"

53
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,080
Hashtag
"MESOTSACCATSAWBA".

54
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,640
This is gratuitous
in so many ways:

55
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,360
the guidelines
had been suspended last summer,

56
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,720
there's a Supreme Court case
that may settle these issues.

57
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,560
Guidelines recommended
that students be called

58
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,720
by their preferred name
and pronoun,

59
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,880
be allowed to use the restrooms
consistent with their gender identity

60
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,240
and be able to wear a tux to prom,
or a dress in yearbook photos.

61
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,960
If the government wants to address
a problem with yearbooks,

62
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,040
maybe ban quotes
by Dave Matthews.

63
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,480
Really, Dylan ?
You've got so much to say ?

64
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,320
Evidence is stacking up
to the contrary.

65
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,120
As we've discussed before,
anti-transgender rules

66
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,160
are almost always rooted
in deep sexual fear-mongering.

67
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,680
The idea they would cover predators
to sneak into ladies' locker rooms,

68
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,120
despite the fact there is
no evidence of that happening.

69
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,560
What there are reports of
are of Trump himself barging in

70
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,600
on women and teenagers
who competed in his pageants,

71
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,080
something that he both denied
and been recorded on tape bragging.

72
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,200
I'll go backstage before a show
and everyone's getting dressed,

73
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,960
no men are anywhere
and I'm allowed to go in

74
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,080
because I'm the owner
and therefore I'm inspecting it.

75
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,760
They're with no clothes.
"Is everybody okay ?"

76
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,600
You see incredible looking women,
I get away with things like that.

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,240
Yeah, you do seem
to sort of get away with it.

78
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,800
If we want to protect
women from predators,

79
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,600
let's stop wasting our time
with pointless bathroom laws

80
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,240
and launch a military operation
to ban the president himself

81
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,280
from women's rooms nationwide.

82
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,640
And now this !

83
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,240
Some random thoughts from
WCBS2 meteorologist John Elliott.

84
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,520
So I am told that if the light
would hit him just right,

85
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,800
Thomas Jefferson had red hair,
your first redheaded president.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,720
Our buddy Joe Iavelli ran
in the New York City Marathon,

87
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,040
didn't break any records,
but he finished, so way to go.

88
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,960
That is great.
Julie's husband.

89
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,680
One, two, three, four...

90
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,160
Four tattoos in the studio
and there's only 2 people here.

91
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,080
I'm kidding. Do you have a tattoo ?

92
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,680
I'd love to do a duet with
John Lithgo. Terrific singer.

93
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,880
I love Ice-T in the commercial
where they... No, it's lemonade.

94
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,600
I love clip-on ties, remember
clip-on ties when you were a kid.

95
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,680
I posted a picture of my mom on
Facebook this week. 600 likes.

96
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,640
Does anyone wear
Ban roll-on anymore ?

97
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,760
With pizza it's all a function of
geometry and the thickness

98
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,760
and then the angle, so yeah
there's really an art to that.

99
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,760
"Jerry Maguire" or "Weekend
at Bernie's" ? I can't decide.

100
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,160
Moving on.
Our main story tonight

101
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,560
is the Affordable Care Act,
also known as Obamacare.

102
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,600
Or, in emails from your uncle as:

103
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,240
"Forward Forward: The Communist
Takeover Of American Values !"

104
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,560
For years now, Obamacare has been
the bane of Republicans' existence.

105
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,760
If Obamacare is ever implemented,
we will never recover from it.

106
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,480
It's an affront on the morality of
the provision of American healthcare.

107
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,200
Obamacare is the worst piece
of legislation ever.

108
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,760
Yes, the worst legislation ever.

109
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,600
So, good news, Fugitive Slave Act !
You're finally off the hook !

110
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,800
Now, with Republicans controlling both
the White House and Congress,

111
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,440
they've gone from talking about
repealing Obamacare to do it.

112
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,280
House and Senate passed budget
resolutions to start the process.

113
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,400
At least one member
is giddy about it.

114
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,040
A little over six years ago
I lived in a pretty decent house.

115
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,080
One day I heard a knock on the door.
And before I knew it

116
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,560
my colleagues
had let a goat loose in my house.

117
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,680
For six years that goat has been
messing in and destroying my house.

118
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,000
I want to renovate my house,
but I have to get the goat out

119
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,800
before it does any more damage.

120
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,440
It makes no sense to start fixing up
until we get the goat out.

121
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,240
Voting for the fiscal year '17 budget
resolution gets this goat out.

122
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,880
That is so specific, no way that
goat incident didn't happen.

123
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,400
I bet he brings it up all the time.

124
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,480
NAFTA is like when
you're half asleep one morning,

125
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,080
you put your arm around what you think
is your wife, but it's that goat again.

126
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,080
You wonder: why is
it wearing my wife's perfume ?

127
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,960
Get this goat out of my house, y'all !

128
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,280
Republicans have been dealing
with an unexpected problem:

129
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,480
constituents at town halls, furious
that Obamacare might be taken away.

130
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,160
I can tell you
three members of my family,

131
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,600
that would be dead

132
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,600
and homeless if it was not for ACA.

133
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,360
Yes. That annoying Obamacare
goat in the house

134
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,960
turned out to be a licensed physician
who's been saving lives,

135
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,400
and a lot of people do not want her
to go anywhere.

136
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,960
I said her. You assumed
that goat doctor was a man ?

137
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,560
What is wrong with you ?

138
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,160
Hashtag Lady Goats Can Be Doctors,
hashtag Feminism.

139
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,840
That tone is a big shift, because
if you remember eight years ago ?

140
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,200
People were terrified
about what Obamacare might mean.

141
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,640
It's a stepping stone for a takeover,
like Hitler did in Germany.

142
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,760
Obama's a Marxist, socialist.

143
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,320
No ! Don't do this to us !

144
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,920
You dirty thieves.

145
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,320
You wanna kill my grandparents,
you come through me first.

146
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,360
President Obama did not want
to kill that guy's grandparents.

147
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,720
He wouldn't have used health insurance.
He'd have just ordered a drone strike

148
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,160
and then declared them enemy
combatants, that was his style.

149
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,880
Let's look at Obamacare.
What it does, what needs fixing,

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,480
and how Republicans plan
to replace it.

151
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,280
It's worth remembering how bad
things were before it was passed.

152
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,320
Nearly 49 million
Americans had no coverage,

153
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,160
insurers could deny
anyone they considered too risky.

154
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,800
Some denied entire professions,
like air traffic controllers,

155
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,800
taxi cab drivers
and scuba divers.

156
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,560
And this baby was denied
coverage at four months old

157
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,240
for an unexpected
pre-existing condition.

158
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,120
His parents decided to apply
for individual health coverage,

159
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,040
but they were turned down.

160
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,960
Not because of his age,
but because he was too fat.

161
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,880
Am I supposed to put my child
on a diet, put him on a treadmill ?

162
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,480
He's an infant.

163
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,840
You're upset. He's never going to
lose the weight with that attitude.

164
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,160
Obamacare was an attempt
to solve those problems.

165
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,120
It made it illegal to deny people
because of pre-existing conditions,

166
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,320
it let people stay on their
parents' plans until age 26,

167
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,720
made preventive screenings free
and created marketplaces

168
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,880
where people could shop
for insurance, with subsidies.

169
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,240
Between that and Medicaid expansion,
20 million people gained coverage,

170
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,920
putting our uninsured rate
at a historic low.

171
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,360
For many people,
like this woman,

172
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,120
whose treatment for breast cancer
was covered under Obamacare,

173
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,880
the law was too closely associated
with the man responsible for it.

174
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,560
I absolutely detest hearing
the words Obamacare.

175
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,160
Detest it !

176
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,520
It just should've been given
a more proper name.

177
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,680
Why be named
after our president ?

178
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,880
It did have a proper name, the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act.

179
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,240
That shows you: it matters
what people call something.

180
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,800
Would Emma Stone be as popular if
her real name was Blump Shartcracker ?

181
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,120
No, that's why it's good
that she changed it.

182
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,800
Some of the early accusations
against Obamacare still linger.

183
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,320
Republican Bill Akins, in Florida,
threw out this classic at a town hall.

184
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,560
Here's the problems I have
with the Affordable Healthcare Act.

185
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,480
There is a provision in there
that anyone over the age of 74

186
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,600
has to go before what is
effectively a death panel.

187
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,600
Yes, they do.
It's in there, folks.

188
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,160
You're wrong.

189
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,640
Okay, children.
All right, children.

190
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,360
It is a death panel.

191
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,680
Who here has read the affordable
healthcare plan ? I doubt that.

192
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,400
What the fuck
are you talking about ?

193
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,520
The notion of "death panels"
isn't just a lie,

194
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,640
it's Politifact's 2009
"Lie of the Year".

195
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,320
Impressive, considering that in 2009,
America was also repeatedly told

196
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,520
Jason Mraz was
the next big thing.

197
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,280
We were lied to
in a big way there.

198
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,920
Obamacare is not perfect.
It had and has serious flaws.

199
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,840
The Healthcare.gov website
was broken on day one

200
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,080
and the president
made a very misleading promise.

201
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,080
If you like your doctor,
you will be able to keep your doctor.

202
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,920
If you like your healthcare plan,
you'll be able to keep it, period.

203
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,160
No one can promise that.
Insurers drop policies

204
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,560
and doctors change networks
all the time.

205
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,800
That is as empty a promise as
a father telling his daughter:

206
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,040
"I will always keep you safe,
period."

207
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,120
Really, Dad ? What about bees ?
What about angry swarms of bees ?

208
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,680
Be honest: "I'll try to keep you safe,
but bees are not fuckin' around."

209
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,520
There've been practical problems:

210
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,960
some plans have deductibles so high,
they're unusable.

211
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,280
Premiums have increased sharply
and some insurers dropped out.

212
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,360
Although that was partly thanks
to Republicans gutting a program

213
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,760
that helped protect insurers
from unexpected losses.

214
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,560
Republicans have happily complained
about the flaws in the law,

215
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,920
taken no responsibility for fixing them
and have often undermined the thing.

216
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,200
But that time is now over.
It is their turn to present a plan.

217
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,000
Insurance companies are deciding

218
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,560
whether to even offer Obamacare
plans next year.

219
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,280
There are ads on TV right now
suggesting that Republicans

220
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,800
have been working
on something special.

221
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,640
Imagine a new path forward:

222
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,120
health insurance that provides more
choices and better care at lower costs.

223
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,680
House Republicans
have a plan to get there !

224
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,320
Without disrupting
existing coverage.

225
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,600
Giving your family
the health care it deserves.

226
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,360
That sounds nice,
but it is a little worrying

227
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,640
that that ad is encouraging you to
"imagine" a better health care plan.

228
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,280
Close your eyes.
Dream of a better way forward.

229
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,040
Tell us what you came up with.
Because we've got nothing.

230
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,520
If you think I'm kidding,
that ad ends with

231
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,560
"learn more at
ABetterHealthcarePlan.com".

232
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,720
This is the entire website:
a single page,

233
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,160
with two sentences of text
and the fucking ad again !

234
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,720
And if you click on the ad,
it'll send you back to the website,

235
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,040
and so on, until you
don't even want healthcare,

236
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,720
you're begging
for the sweet relief of death.

237
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,880
Every time you get near something
resembling a Republican plan,

238
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,040
it seems
to recede into the distance.

239
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,720
In January, Trump said he was
working on one

240
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,160
"very much formulated down
to the final strokes."

241
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,120
Tom Price, his secretary of health
and human services,

242
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,880
was asked about it
at his confirmation hearing.

243
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,400
President said he's working with you
on a replacement plan for the ACA,

244
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,160
nearly finished and to be revealed
after your confirmation.

245
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,320
- True ?
- It's true that he said that, yes.

246
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,880
It's funny because the president lies
to us with no repercussions !

247
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,680
I see what the joke
we're laughing at is. Dear !

248
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,280
If you need any more proof of how
unprepared Republicans are,

249
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,360
let me show you one of the draft bills
they circulated.

250
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,040
It is seven pages long, and it ends
abruptly with the world "placeholder".

251
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,320
One member of Congress
tried to spin that as a positive.

252
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,440
This placeholder provides
the clearest signal

253
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,360
we're working with patients
and health care groups

254
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,760
to draft language that balances
health status protections

255
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,560
with necessary risk mitigation tools.

256
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,040
If your spouse gave you a birthday
card that said "placeholder",

257
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,480
they're not working on best language
to express their feelings for you.

258
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,880
They forgot your birthday, because
they're fucking Sharon from the office.

259
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,760
Deep down,
I think you know that.

260
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,240
The best sense we have
of what Republicans want to do

261
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,200
is from previous plans
from both Price and Paul Ryan

262
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,160
and from these talking points

263
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,440
that Ryan gave out ahead
of the Congressional recess.

264
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,480
You are going to be hearing phrases
from this a lot in the coming months,

265
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,400
so let's take a moment
to understand what they mean.

266
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,760
Let's start with the one
Ryan has been talking up a great deal.

267
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,120
What we believe
is the right way to go,

268
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:09,040
are refundable tax credits for people
to be able to buy affordable coverage.

269
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,560
Yes, refundable tax credits.
Free money to help pay your premiums.

270
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,480
Surprising, coming from Paul Ryan,
a man who probably tips waiters

271
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,400
by writing on the check: "find a job
the market deemed has more value".

272
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:29,120
This document suggests tax credits
would be based on age, not income.

273
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,680
Meaning theoretically,
61-year-old billionaire Bill Gates

274
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,520
would get a bigger subsidy than
a 27-year-old making minimum wage.

275
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,720
Gates does not need that money !

276
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,640
He'll blow it on more $10 haircuts
and orthopedic sweaters.

277
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,360
The risk is subsidies ending up too
small for who need them the most.

278
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,320
Tom Price once proposed a credit
1 200 dollars to peoples aged 18-35

279
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,960
and 3 000 dollars to people 50 and up
which is roughly a third the cost

280
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,080
of the most bare bones plans
on the market today.

281
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,680
A tax credit that small
helps cover your health insurance

282
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,240
the way a thong
covers your dad's ass.

283
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,600
It doesn't and there's something
fundamentally wrong about that.

284
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,080
Now the next big term
is "health savings accounts" or HSA's.

285
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,040
Tax-free accounts where you can save
money to pay health care costs.

286
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,000
Republicans love these things.

287
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:31,160
Why do these savings accounts...
Why are you pushing so hard for them ?

288
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,640
Why do you think they're effective ?

289
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,160
You're spending your own money
as opposed to someone else's.

290
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,600
It's like when my daughter goes
to the mall with my credit card

291
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,200
or when I go to the mall
with my credit card.

292
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,680
Our purchases come back different.

293
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,560
Setting aside that healthcare is
nothing like shopping at the mall,

294
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,440
shouldn't you come back
with different purchases

295
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,880
regardless of whose
credit card you have ?

296
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,360
If you came back
with a tongue ring,

297
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,160
a bottle of Manic Panic hair dye
and a "yas queen" crop-top,

298
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,040
it would raise questions having
nothing to do with healthcare.

299
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,440
The key problem with HSAs
should be obvious here:

300
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,680
they're great for rich people,
but if you're too poor to save,

301
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,960
or you get sick enough
to blow through what you've saved,

302
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,800
you're not going to be covered and
you have that thong problem again.

303
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,000
People understand that.

304
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,800
Listen the reaction when Joni Ernst
brought them up at a town hall.

305
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,160
But health savings accounts,
it isn't...

306
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,320
That is an appropriate reaction
when your problem is:

307
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,560
"I don't have enough money"
and the proposed solution is:

308
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,280
"if you ever do,
here's a very fancy piggy bank."

309
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:55,640
Let's move to another key idea: block
grants. A phrase designed to bore you

310
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,720
'cause it combines "block",
the most nothing shape,

311
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,720
with "Grant",
your co-worker's nothing boyfriend.

312
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:07,520
"I don't believe we've met."
Yes we have. Six times. I'm Grant.

313
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,920
Paul Ryan wants to use block
grants to fund Medicaid,

314
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
which provides health care to
the poorest Americans.

315
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,440
He wants to stop guaranteeing
to pay each state a percentage

316
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,560
of their Medicaid costs and send
them a fixed block of money.

317
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,920
If costs start to rise and the block
grant doesn't keep pace...

318
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,720
It's that thong...

319
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,400
A few years ago Ryan proposed
a block-grant program

320
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,080
that a study estimated could kick
20,5 million people off Medicaid

321
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,440
over a decade.

322
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,480
That's a kind of evil so chillingly
banal you don't see it coming.

323
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,840
It's like if you found out that
Grant was a serial killer.

324
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,240
I kill in plain sight, for none can
remember my face. I am Grant.

325
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,680
We've now met seven times.

326
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,280
The final big talking point here.
I'll let Paul Ryan explain.

327
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,760
State high-risk pools are a smarter
way of guaranteeing coverage

328
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,800
for people
with pre-existing conditions.

329
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,120
High-risk pools. They may sound like
something you find at Jeremy Piven,

330
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,640
but they isolate the sickest people
in their own insurance group.

331
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,280
This brings everyone else's insurance
rates down.

332
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,880
But there is an obvious problem here:
those pools are going to be expensive,

333
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,320
which is fine, if the government
subsidizes them properly.

334
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,400
If it doesn't, that's right:
it's thong o'clock everybody.

335
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,320
Three years ago, a study estimated
that adequately funding high-risk pools

336
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,840
to maintain Obamacare
levels of coverage,

337
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,520
would cost $178 billion a year.

338
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:54,040
Guess how much Tom Price set aside ?
Three billion over three years.

339
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,480
That is one 178 of what is needed.

340
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:03,240
Imagine you asked for 178 pounds
of grade-A premium hunk.

341
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,840
Instead of Chris Evans, someone
brought you six of his severed toes.

342
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,640
Tom Price's plan
is six severed hunk toes.

343
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,040
Those are the four big bullet points.

344
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,160
The most revealing thing is not what's
inside it, but what is not in there.

345
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,800
There is no replacement
for the individual mandate.

346
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,720
Obamacare's requirement that you
have insurance or pay a penalty.

347
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,320
It is the thing
that people hate the most.

348
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,360
The individual mandate
is unconstitutional.

349
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,000
We've got to get rid
of the individual mandate,

350
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,120
a freedom killing part of the ACA.

351
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,720
That should be repealed.
Get rid of the individual mandate.

352
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,440
Who's got two thumbs and hates
the individual mandate ? This guy !

353
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,240
But the mandate keeps younger,
healthier people in the system,

354
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,160
which is crucial to lower
the cost for everyone else

355
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:01,240
and to keep in popular provisions,
like not punishing fat babies.

356
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,640
Republicans' solution is to make it
painful for you to get insurance again

357
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,760
if you drop it at any point,
for any reason.

358
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,960
They use the positive-sounding term
"continuous coverage incentive",

359
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,240
but it has to involve
some penalty.

360
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,520
Maybe a higher premium
or even denial of coverage.

361
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,760
They are not keen to talk
about details.

362
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:27,400
Remember the "placeholder" ?
That was in place of an explanation

363
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,800
of the continuous
coverage incentive.

364
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,440
This is a subject so toxic,
they'd rather go abruptly silent,

365
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,480
much like when you're a white person
singing karaoke and you realize:

366
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,600
"we have an n-word coming up."

367
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:49,800
Republicans are in a real bind:
they need a plan and soon,

368
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,680
and what Price and Ryan
have given them so far

369
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,880
seems to shift costs from
the government to the people,

370
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,240
and fewer people are
going to be covered.

371
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,680
Good luck fixing that, Republicans !
There's one more problem here.

372
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,600
Remember the shit you gave Obama
for saying you can keep your doctor ?

373
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,720
Let me remind you what Trump
promised that you are going to do.

374
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,960
Everybody's got to be covered.
This is an un-Republican thing

375
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,120
because they say: "no, the lower
25 percent, they can't afford private".

376
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,240
- Universal health care.
- I'll take care of everybody.

377
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,960
I don't care if it costs me votes.
Everybody will be taken care of.

378
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,200
- Who pays for it ?
- The government.

379
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,640
We'll save so much money
on the other side.

380
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,760
It's going to be a private plan
and people are going to negotiate

381
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:42,400
with different competition,
with great companies

382
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,760
and they can have their doctors,
they can have everything.

383
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,120
"They can have everything."
Period !

384
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,680
Anything short of that is a disaster.
Insurers are gonna need an answer,

385
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,760
so tick-tock, motherfuckers,

386
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,120
'cause you don't get to "placeholder"
your way out of this one again.

387
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,080
And now, this.

388
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,000
WCBS-2 Meteorologist John Elliott
drops some famous names.

389
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,320
How weird, my nephew, Will Carr,
hangs around with John Grisham's kid.

390
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,960
My beloved, late father's first cousin,
growing up, they were buddies,

391
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,200
he was a close friend
of Ronald Reagan's.

392
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Bridget Moynahan watches Channel 2.
She's probably watching now.

393
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,200
Sweet as they come
and we appreciate her tuning in.

394
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,880
I love Madam Secretary.
I met Tim Daly at an auto show.

395
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,760
Lionel Richie is a nice guy.
He's been in here.

396
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,720
I like the Peyton Manning commercials.
He seems like such a nice guy.

397
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,760
I met Norman Lear in the cafeteria
here. Nicest guy ever.

398
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,560
And we have pictures of some
of the great Norman Lear hits.

399
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,320
It was a very nice moment.
Nice guy. He had a salad.

400
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,840
And finally:
a few words about the Supreme Court.

401
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,600
America's most respected
adult-assisted living community.

402
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,880
As you probably know,
there is currently a vacancy,

403
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,200
following the death
of Antonin Scalia.

404
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,240
A few weeks ago,
Trump announced his nominee.

405
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:24,280
President Trump unveiling Neil Gorsuch
as his nominee to the Supreme Court.

406
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,880
Yes, Neil Gorsuch,
a man so blandly handsome,

407
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:32,120
it feels like you saw him on page 14
of any JC Penney's catalog

408
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,560
or as second lead
in a erectile dysfunction ad.

409
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,640
He is aggressively Caucasian.
He's like a white Tim Kaine.

410
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:46,480
There is a lot for Democrats to be
annoyed about here:

411
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:51,480
not only is Gorsuch conservative,
Republicans basically stole this seat.

412
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,920
Merrick Garland, who Obama
nominated eleven months ago,

413
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,680
wasn't even given a hearing.

414
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,720
The debate is whether
to filibuster Gorsuch

415
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,480
or confirm a man whose place
on the Supreme Court

416
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,440
will always have
an asterisk on it.

417
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,280
Which puts our show
in a tricky position, as well.

418
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,000
We have an all-dog Supreme Court
to reenact oral arguments,

419
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,800
since cameras are not
allowed in the courtroom.

420
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,600
When Merrick Garland was nominated,
we held a vote to choose his dog

421
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,680
and you, the people, chose Molly.

422
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,120
Molly never got to serve,
she's on a farm upstate

423
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,320
with a lot of grass and toys,
not unlike the actual Merrick Garland.

424
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,720
We should be finding a dog for
Gorsuch. We're not going to do that.

425
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,600
To reflect the fact that Gorsuch's
nomination is a historical aberration,

426
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,240
he will be getting an animal
that will constantly remind us

427
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,880
that it has no place
in that spot on a dog court.

428
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,920
Gorsuch is getting a lobster.
That's right !

429
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,400
We're going "paws & claws"
up in this piece.

430
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,480
But we still need your help
to pick a lobster Gorsuch.

431
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,520
We are asking you to
advise and consent

432
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,480
on the choice between
these three glorious lobster justices,

433
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,360
all of whom,
like Neil Gorsuch himself,

434
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,440
have absolutely
no business being here !

435
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,920
First up, there is Cindy Clawford !
A strict constructionist

436
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,080
who believes life begins at
the piercing of the abdomen

437
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,000
with the first pair of pleopods.

438
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,680
Pinchers Von Shellington the third !
An opponent of judicial activism

439
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,960
who pairs beautifully
with a light tarragon-cream sauce !

440
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,320
Finally, there's Mike !
His teeth are actually a gastric mill

441
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,640
located in his stomach
and he's just a fucking lobster !

442
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,480
So, choose wisely, America,
because this is a lifetime appointment

443
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,200
and lobsters can apparently live
to be up to 100 years old.

444
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,640
Who knew !
So visit our Twitter feed

445
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,560
and choose Cindy Clawford,
Pinchers, or Mike,

446
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,880
or tweet your thoughts using
the Hashtag Claw and Order.

447
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:03,080
Thank you so much for joining us,
see you next week, good night !

448
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,800
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

449
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,880
END OF EPISODE 3,
SEASON IV
