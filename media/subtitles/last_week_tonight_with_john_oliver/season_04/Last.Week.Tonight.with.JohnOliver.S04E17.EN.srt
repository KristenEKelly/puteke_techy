LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,840
Season IV
Episode 17

3
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,920
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,040
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,960
Look, before we begin:
you may remember, last week,

6
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,880
we did a story about coal,
the reason Dick Van Dyke looked

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,600
like he spent all of Mary Poppins
in blackface.

8
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,600
One of the coal company CEOs
that we mentioned

9
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,000
was not particularly thrilled
with how the piece turned out.

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,680
Oliver is the target of a lawsuit by
one of privately-owned coal company.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,640
Oliver criticized
Murray Energy Corporation

12
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,680
and CEO Robert Murray on his show
Last Night Week Last Week Tonight.

13
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,880
It's true ! We here at the show
"Last Night Week Last Week Tonight"

14
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,920
are currently being sued
by Bob Murray, CEO of Murray Energy.

15
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,400
I desperately want to talk to you
about this tonight.

16
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,680
Our lawyers suggested that the courts
be the venue where we work this out.

17
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,400
But I promise we will tell you
all about this, as soon as it is over.

18
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,800
Of course, Mr. Nutterbutter will get
a chance to tell his side of the story.

19
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,640
Of course he will.
But for now, for now tonight,

20
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,680
let's move on to President Trump,
two words that don't belong together,

21
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,600
but that we're all getting used
to hearing out loud,

22
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,520
like "Instagram celebrity"
or "Ansel Elgort".

23
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,320
Back in May, Trump suggested on
Twitter that he may have tapes

24
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,560
of his conversations with deposed
FBI director and Slenderman alter-ego

25
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,880
James Comey.

26
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,640
On Thursday, Trump finally
admitted that he had no such tapes

27
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,160
and offered up
this rationale for his claim.

28
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,280
I didn't tape him. You never
know what's happening

29
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,240
when you see that Obama administration
and perhaps longer than that,

30
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,040
was doing all of this unmasking and
surveillance you read all about it.

31
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,240
I've been reading about it
for the last couple of months,

32
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,040
about the horrible situation with
surveillance all over the place,

33
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,640
and you've been hearing
the word unmasking,

34
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,960
a word you
probably never heard before.

35
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,000
So you never know
what's out there,

36
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,920
I don't have
any tape and I didn't tape.

37
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,880
What the fuck was that ?

38
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,720
Whenever Trump talks,
it's like a cross between

39
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,960
a lottery machine
that spits out words

40
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,920
and a Speak-and-Spell
that just fell into a toilet.

41
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,080
But he wasn't done.
Trump had not yet explained

42
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,760
the strategic brilliance of how
his tweet influenced Comey.

43
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,680
Wait for the reporter's
follow-up at the end.

44
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,040
When he found out that
there may be tapes out there,

45
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,680
whether it's governmental tapes
or anything else and who knows,

46
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,880
his story may have changed,
you'll have to take a look at that,

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,200
because then he has to tell what
took place at the events,

48
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,680
my story was always a straight
story, my story was always the truth,

49
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,880
but you'll have to determine
whether or not his story changed,

50
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,720
but I did not tape.

51
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,520
It was a smart way to make sure
he stayed honest, in those hearings.

52
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,840
It wasn't very stupid,
I can tell you that.

53
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,800
"It wasn't very stupid." Let's break
down what just happened there.

54
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,320
First: world-class reporting,
Fox News,

55
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,960
you held his feet
to the fire there.

56
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,080
Second: he seemed justifiably taken
off-guard by that compliment.

57
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,880
Third: think about
what he just said.

58
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,160
He didn't just admit to misleading
the American public.

59
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,680
He also implied that doing so
may've swayed Comey's testimony

60
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,600
which, if that was his intent,
could constitute witness tampering.

61
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,640
He then implied he made Comey tell
the truth about their conversations,

62
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,560
seemingly verifying Comey's account,
which is damaging to the president.

63
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,400
Trump might be right,
it wasn't "very stupid".

64
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,120
It was extraordinarily stupid.

65
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,640
All this served to distract from
the important business in Washington

66
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,040
concerning the Senate's new
Obamacare replacement bill,

67
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,800
the "Better Care Reconciliation Act",
released on Thursday,

68
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,400
and denounced
by many Democrats.

69
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,080
Obama took to Facebook to say:
"it would raise costs,"

70
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,240
"reduce coverage, roll back protections
and ruin Medicaid as we know it."

71
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,240
Obviously Obama objects
to repealing the ACA.

72
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,160
His parents literally
named him after Obamacare.

73
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,840
Of course he would say that,
so put that aside.

74
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,360
Chuck Schumer engaged
in some spectacular prop comedy.

75
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,880
When the White House
passed their health care bill,

76
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,640
a bill that President Trump
called "mean",

77
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,600
I thought it wouldn't be possible
for the Senate Republicans

78
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,520
to conjure up a bill
even worse than that one.

79
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,320
Unfortunately,
that is what they have done.

80
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,840
Meaner. Can you read it ?
Do I have to color it in ?

81
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,280
How's that ? Right there.
"Meaner".

82
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,960
My God.

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,600
Now, if political theater
were actual theater,

84
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,680
it's the equivalent of someone
falling to their death

85
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,720
in "Spiderman: Turn Off The Dark".

86
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,280
As for the contents of the bill,
it is set to hurt a lot of people.

87
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,880
BCRA preserves much of what
was objectionable in the House bill,

88
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,400
like deregulation for insurers
to drastically cut their coverage.

89
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,560
When it comes
to Medicaid spending,

90
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,320
this new version is, in some ways,
even harsher than it was before.

91
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,680
The House bill would end
Medicaid expansion in three years

92
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,200
and give states a block grant
to fund Medicaid as they see fit.

93
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,120
The Senate version phases out
Medicaid expansion more slowly,

94
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,680
starting in 2021, but makes
deeper cuts to the overall program

95
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,720
by reducing
federal funding over time.

96
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,200
House bill would cut Medicaid
relatively quickly,

97
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,240
the Senate bill would do it
slowly, but far more drastically.

98
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,400
Both options are deadly.

99
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,920
It's choosing between
getting run over by a drunk driver

100
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,320
or getting run over
by a drunk elephant.

101
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,160
That elephant has been going through
a rough patch since her divorce.

102
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,360
That's right, I said "her".

103
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,320
Hashtag "lady elephants can commit
involuntary manslaughter,"

104
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,680
hashtag "feminism".

105
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:08,000
Those cuts will have massive
impacts right now,

106
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,840
Medicaid covers 20% of all Americans,
49% of births,

107
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,400
60% of children with disabilities
and 64% of nursing home residents.

108
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,600
Unless you are a professional beach
volleyball player with a vasectomy,

109
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,080
estranged from his family
and who plans to jump into a volcano,

110
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,040
you or someone you know
desperately needs these services.

111
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,840
Some Republicans have come out
against this bill in its current form.

112
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Some, because it's too harsh,
others, because it is not harsh enough.

113
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,080
And of course Ted Cruz is
in that group. Of course he is.

114
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,000
He is the only man in history
whose personality

115
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,760
somehow contracted bedbugs.

116
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,800
I would be very careful relying
on those politicians to hold out.

117
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,320
Rand Paul suggested he might
vote for the bill if they needed him

118
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,960
and Ron Johnson said he wasn't
a "no", he was just a "not yes yet".

119
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,760
Isn't so much a courageous stance
as it is not a cowardly stance yet.

120
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,720
You should be wary of any
coverage with this kind of tone.

121
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,800
The Republican Senate health
care bill is on life support.

122
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,480
Is the plan to repeal and replace
Obamacare on life support ?

123
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,960
A Senate plan that
is dead on arrival.

124
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:37,320
It would seem the Republican
version of the bill is dead on arrival.

125
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,560
That's great, it's dead on arrival.
Then kick back and relax,

126
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,240
I haven't felt this confident about
an outcome since Tuesday,

127
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,160
November the 8th, 2016.

128
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:55,040
There is every chance that
absent huge effort to stop it,

129
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,240
this bill may well pass.

130
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,440
So resisting complacency would be,
to borrow a truly moronic phrase,

131
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,320
"not very stupid, I can tell you that."

132
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,280
And now this.

133
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:13,480
The ongoing controversy over
WNEP 16 Scranton's backyard train.

134
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,520
Talk back callers seem to be obsessed
with the train in our backyard.

135
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,400
I would just like to know
whose idea it was

136
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,080
to put a train in the backyard.

137
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,360
I'm trying to watch the news and hear
the weather and it's distracting.

138
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,320
I'm calling about your train !
Keep the train rolling, baby.

139
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,800
How 'bout making this train
go the right way ?

140
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,800
Now is the wrong way.

141
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,480
We don't care if it's going backwards
or frontwards, we just enjoy it.

142
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,280
That trolley keeps blowing over
because it's not supposed to be there.

143
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,520
The train's supposed to be there,
not the trolley.

144
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,520
Tell that guy that complained
about the trolley being on,

145
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,360
conductor can put anything
on the track he wants to.

146
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,720
Shut up
and go do your supper dishes.

147
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,440
What is going on with the train ?
It hasn't been running in weeks.

148
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:22,000
I wish that I could put a quarter stick
in that train and blow it up.

149
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,640
We're calling again. Your train
is not running once again.

150
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,200
I'm sick of these idiots worrying about
the stupid train in the backyard.

151
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,920
Your news show is on so
many times during the day

152
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,760
that you oughta just take
one of those half hours

153
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,360
and play nothing but a video of a train
running around in a circle.

154
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,080
Maybe that would pacify these idiots
who call when the train isn't running.

155
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:02,080
Moving on. For our main story,
we're going to talk about vaccines.

156
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,560
Or, as the "fun doctor" at your
family practice puts it:

157
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,680
"Shots ! Shots !" Seriously,
there'll be a slight pinch.

158
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,760
Vaccines are humanity's
most incredible accomplishment

159
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
and they've saved
millions of lives.

160
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,360
There was a time when a new one
was a cause for huge celebration.

161
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,840
Dr. Jonas Salk discovers a vaccine
that promises to wipe out

162
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,720
childhood's crippling
and killing enemy, polio.

163
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,240
Anxious parents are thrilled
and grateful,

164
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,880
responding to one of the greatest
mass inoculations in annals.

165
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,000
People lined up for the polio shot
like it was an iPhone !

166
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,240
Polio was never
"childhood's most crippling enemy",

167
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,760
because that was
and will forever remain:

168
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,360
"accidentally seeing
your father's penis."

169
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:02,000
Despite their success, small groups are
skeptical and vocal about vaccines.

170
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,440
Their voice has been amplified
by the human megaphone

171
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,640
that is the president of the US.

172
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,200
I am in favor of vaccines.

173
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,480
But I want smaller doses
over a longer period of time.

174
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,320
You take a baby in,
and I've seen it,

175
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,680
and I had my children taken care
of over a long period of time,

176
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,200
same exact amount, but you
take this little beautiful baby...

177
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,560
It looks like it's meant
for a horse, not for a child.

178
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,800
Trump, on the campaign trail, raising
doubts about vaccinations.

179
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,360
A sentiment he's also expressed
online, with a tweet reading:

180
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,720
"tiny children are not horses."

181
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,400
That is an assertion
that PolitiFact rates:

182
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,280
"I guess technically we've gotta
give him that, but, good grief."

183
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,560
You know this: it is not wise
to take health care advice

184
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,920
from a man who has willingly sought
care from this doctor,

185
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,080
who looks like he sneaks into a Senor
Frog's to fucks the mozzarella sticks.

186
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,520
It is not just Trump who is skeptical

187
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,760
and those concerns have driven
some people to extremes.

188
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,320
In 2011, some parents made headlines
by taking what they saw

189
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,600
as a more natural route
to immunizing their children.

190
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,440
We're talking about parents
who are taking used lollipops,

191
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,560
saliva and pus-soaked clothing
from complete strangers

192
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,320
and deliberately
infecting their children.

193
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:42,680
Setting aside the grossness of parents
infecting their kids with lollipops,

194
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,320
that graphic
has an unfortunate misspelling,

195
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,480
"swapping spit and passing puss"
sounds like the sex talk

196
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,000
that Kid Rock
would give his teenage son.

197
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,480
You're gonna wanna swap
some spit and pass some puss,

198
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,960
but if you don't throw a raincoat
on that devil dog

199
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,440
it's gonna be scorch
city for you, buckaroo.

200
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,720
We just had some quality time.

201
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,680
While it is important to remember
that the vast majority of parents

202
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,960
are making sure their children
get vaccinated on time,

203
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,280
the voices of those who don't,
carry.

204
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,040
Any internet search about vaccines
will quickly lead you

205
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,920
down a frightening rabbit hole.

206
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,520
The background hum of doubt
can make some parents nervous.

207
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,720
I'm concerned about
how many vaccines

208
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,120
we have to give
our children at once.

209
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,960
I will do them,
but I'm debating the age.

210
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,880
When should I have them done ?

211
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,400
There's so much information there,
I don't know who to ask.

212
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,920
There's no such thing
as an unbiased source.

213
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,880
At least 10 percent of parents
delay or skip some shots.

214
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,120
Around one percent
don't vaccinate at all.

215
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,120
Parents get so much information,
it is hard to know what to do.

216
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,200
Should you vaccinate ?
Should you eat the placenta ?

217
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,480
Should you let kids cry ?
And the answer to those,

218
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,720
are yes, no, and absolutely,
because the more they cry now,

219
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,800
the more they'll be prepared to watch
"This Is Us" when they get older.

220
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,040
This atmosphere of confusion about
vaccines caused real problems.

221
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,240
In 11 states, the number of
unvaccinated kids is on the rise.

222
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,400
And in small pockets,
the numbers can get startlingly high.

223
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,840
In the Somali community
in Minnesota,

224
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,720
the measles vaccination rate for
children dropped to 42 percent.

225
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,240
And that had
very real consequences.

226
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,160
Measles, once eradicated in the US,
is now exploding in Minnesota,

227
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,080
where many parents
won't vaccinate.

228
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,840
If you're exposed to it and
you don't have the vaccine,

229
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,120
there's a 90% chance
you'll contract it.

230
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,000
They can have permanent brain
damage, blindness or deafness.

231
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:11,000
We wouldn't vaccinate
if this was just a rashy illness.

232
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:17,240
Exactly: in that community,
the number of measles cases this year

233
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,880
outpaced the total number
in all the US last year.

234
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,720
And that is terrible, the only
thing Minnesota should have more

235
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,520
of than any other state
is Garrisons Keillor

236
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,280
and people disappointed
by the Mall of America.

237
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,120
So it's just a bigger mall and
it has two Build-A-Bear workshops ?

238
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,320
That's amazing. This memory
will last me a lifetime.

239
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,760
As will these two bears.

240
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,240
From two different
Build-a-Bear workshops.

241
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,360
We are going to look
at why these fears persist

242
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,600
and what the consequences
of succumbing to them can be.

243
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,920
I get why vaccines
can creep people out.

244
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,400
Vaccination is getting injected by
a needle filled with science juice.

245
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,480
Pretty much every medical
practice sounds terrifying

246
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,400
when you break it down
like that.

247
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,320
An appendectomy means removing one
of your organs through stabbery.

248
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,800
Antibiotics are poisons used
to murder things living in you.

249
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,560
And even exercise means forcefully
burning up your insides.

250
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,560
The human body
is a true carnival of horrors

251
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,480
and I'm embarrassed
to have one.

252
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,600
Much of the fear
surrounding vaccines

253
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,200
stems from their
supposed link to autism.

254
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,040
A theory that gained traction
in the late '90s,

255
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,960
thanks to a study published
in The Lancet,

256
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,320
suggesting a link between autism
and the MMR vaccine.

257
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,800
The study was of just 12 children
by this guy, Andrew Wakefield.

258
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,440
If you're wondering why I didn't say
"Dr." Andrew Wakefield, this is why.

259
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,080
Follow-up studies of hundreds
of thousands of children

260
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,840
could not find any evidence
that the MMR vaccine causes autism.

261
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,920
Investigations into
Wakefield's original paper revealed

262
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,520
he distorted the data
and acted unethically.

263
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,920
He's lost his medical license.
The Lancet paper has been retracted.

264
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,040
Wakefield made a big splash
before having his title revoked.

265
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,840
He's the Lance Armstrong
of doctors.

266
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,360
Even though Wakefield's conclusions
have been debunked many times,

267
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,720
he still gives talks about the
supposed dangers of the MMR vaccine.

268
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,520
This is him in 2011,
talking to the Somali community

269
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,840
we saw earlier in Minnesota,
and presumably ending his speech with:

270
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,200
"trust me:
I'm a used-to-be-a-doctor."

271
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:48,000
Wakefield is not the only voice
raising alarms about vaccines.

272
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,000
He has company
from across the political spectrum,

273
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,200
from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
on the left,

274
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,360
to Alex Jones wherever the fuck
he fits in, to even this guy.

275
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,880
You can't make people
do procedures that they don't want.

276
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,120
The parents have to be the ones
to make decisions for our kids.

277
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,600
It can't be the government.
Against Nuremberg Laws.

278
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,320
Rob Schneider performing an
impromptu rendition of his character:

279
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,400
"the annoying guy
who is wrong."

280
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:26,080
Despite his misunderstanding of
what the Nuremberg Laws are,

281
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,720
and what constitutes acceptable
headwear for a grown man,

282
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,720
Schneider has spoken out against
mandatory vaccines for years,

283
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,520
calling this California state
assemblywoman to debate the issue,

284
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,560
prompting her
to post on Facebook:

285
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,720
"that is 20 minutes of my life
I'll never get back arguing"

286
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,680
"that vaccines don't cause autism
with Deuce Bigalow, male gigolo."

287
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,760
Sure, it's funny.
But, you know, hold on, lady.

288
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,840
Let's not sully the good name
of Deuce Bigalow

289
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,840
because of something that
his portrayer, Rob Schneider, said.

290
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,120
That's like implying William Wallace
doesn't trust Jews

291
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,160
or Officer Nordberg
is a murderer.

292
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,320
Try and separate the two.

293
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:14,520
These days, very few people will say
they are completely anti-vaccine.

294
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,120
Instead, like the president, they'll
say: "I'm not anti-vaccine... but."

295
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,840
And it's what comes after that
"but", that we need to look at.

296
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,080
One example is: "I'm not anti-vaccine,
but I am pro-safe vaccine."

297
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,200
And that can often refer to concern
over scary-sounding ingredients,

298
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,080
like thimerosal,
a mercury-based preservative.

299
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,760
RFK Jr. has led a crusade against it,

300
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,800
just this year, he gave
a speech where he said this.

301
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,960
For 33 years I've been working
to get mercury out of fish.

302
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,840
Nobody has ever called me anti-fish.

303
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,240
I want mercury out of vaccines,
I should not be called anti-vaccine.

304
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,320
Why would anyone be ashamed
to be called anti-fish ?

305
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,480
Fish are stupid. How do
I know that ? Look at them !

306
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:12,080
Just look at this idiot ! It's not
just him, check this moron out,

307
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,360
and while you're at it,
what about this dimwit ?

308
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,960
Here's another bonehead.

309
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm pretty sure this dunce
didn't make it past the third grade.

310
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,120
This doofus isn't curing cancer.
That's right ! Come at me, fish !

311
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,760
I'm sorry, you can't, can ya ?
And that's because,

312
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,920
after five hundred million years,
you haven't figured out how to breathe.

313
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,280
Fuck you, fish, it's easy.
I'm doing it now.

314
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,840
Ea-sy. You don't' know me, fish.
Get out of here.

315
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:50,520
More importantly,
in fact, much more importantly,

316
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,120
the mercury that has been used
in vaccines

317
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,600
is not the same kind
that is harmful in fish.

318
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,240
There have been multiple large
studies finding no link

319
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,720
between thimerosal and autism.

320
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,480
Perhaps most importantly of all,
since the early 2000s,

321
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,160
it has been removed as a preservative
from all vaccines for infants,

322
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,640
except for the flu vaccines
and even there,

323
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,120
thimerosalfree versions
are available.

324
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,120
We spent time and energy solving
a problem that never existed.

325
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,400
It's like spending years fighting to
get marshmallows out of Lucky Charms,

326
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,880
because a few people think minions
can choke to death on them.

327
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,080
For a start, marshmallows dissolve
and minions don't exist,

328
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,040
and if they did, I would
want them to choke to death,

329
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,600
'cause those little fuckers
will murder us.

330
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,880
Open you eyes !

331
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:51,480
If you're thinking: if it wasn't
harmful, why was it taken out ?

332
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,760
There was intense public concern
amplified by people like

333
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,200
then-congressman Dan Burton,
making arguments like this.

334
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,920
I have yet to find any scientist
who will say there is no doubt

335
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,640
that the mercury in vaccines
does not contribute to autism.

336
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,680
They'll say there's
no scientific evidence,

337
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,640
there's no studies or anything
that proves that yet.

338
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,240
Turn that around, there are
no studies that disprove it, either.

339
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:25,240
Here's the thing. Proving a negative
is an impossible standard.

340
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,360
And that is also a slippery slope.
Because it means that I can say

341
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,920
you, Dan Burton,
are a donkey fucker.

342
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,880
You dress up donkeys in cheerleader
outfits and you fuck them.

343
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,880
It's what you're into.
And you do it all the time.

344
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:45,240
And you will say to me there is
no evidence of me doing that.

345
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,720
But I would say:
turn that around,

346
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,200
there's no evidence of you
not doing that, either.

347
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,400
See, Dan ? This is not a road
you want to go down.

348
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,440
The thing is, that donkey-fucker's
remarks actually get

349
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,360
at why scientists can be
at a real disadvantage in this debate.

350
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,280
Because they are careful in how
they present their conclusions.

351
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,840
Science and English are not
really the same language.

352
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,920
And so when a scientist says,

353
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,720
we have no evidence there's a link
between vaccines and autism,

354
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,840
what they're really saying is,

355
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,760
we are as positive as someone can
humanly be that there's no link.

356
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,600
One thing that I sometimes do
when I'm talking to parents is say,

357
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,880
I'm as confident that there's no
link between vaccines and autism

358
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,560
as I am that if I walk off this
building I would not be able to fly.

359
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,760
Right. And that is about
as clear as you can be.

360
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,200
If your doctor does believe
they can fly, run.

361
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,400
They are either crazy
or they are R. Kelly.

362
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,640
If your pediatrician is R. Kelly,

363
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,280
vaccines are the least
of your problems.

364
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,080
I know that some will say that the
real problem is that scientists

365
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,040
are being paid by pharma companies
to hide the problems with vaccines.

366
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,080
You can find countless memes about
how the system is corrupt,

367
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,880
some of which feature
a very smart looking cat.

368
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,680
I'm not saying there are not
problems with big pharma.

369
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,840
There absolutely are. We have
discussed them before.

370
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,800
But on the rare occasions when there
have been issues with vaccines,

371
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,600
they have been pulled and fast.

372
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,880
I know that that explanation
will still not satisfy some.

373
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,680
There are gonna be some toxic
comments below this video,

374
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,600
alongside the usual ones

375
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,680
about how I look like an owl
who can't get a date for prom,

376
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,560
or that I probably live alone,

377
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,480
surrounded by jars
I'm too weak to open by myself.

378
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,920
You're laughing too hard
at that.

379
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,480
And those comments will link
to the hidden truths about vaccines

380
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,120
and demand to know
why I didn't look into them.

381
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,760
We did look into a lot of them
and the problem is

382
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,440
I could go point by point
and be talking for hours tonight

383
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,320
and this will still never end.

384
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,560
It's like whack-a-mole. As one
theory goes down, another pops up.

385
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,760
I kind of get the insistence
that there must be a link.

386
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,000
The age children are supposed
to get the MMR vaccine

387
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,360
happens to be the same age that
signs of autism can appear.

388
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,800
But correlation
is not causation.

389
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,320
That is what scientific studies
are for. And remember:

390
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,120
they are really clear,
that link is not there.

391
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,720
And the problem with spending more
and more time and money

392
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,040
trying to prove that link
is that it takes resources away

393
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,800
from studying actual causes
and treatments.

394
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,680
Listen to the mother
of one child with autism,

395
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:52,240
who started a foundation,
she wanted to find out the causes.

396
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,960
We have dozens of studies !

397
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,520
We were right to look at whether
vaccines might be a cause of autism,

398
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,400
but there comes a point where
there is so much evidence,

399
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,280
none of which shows any link
between vaccines and autism,

400
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,480
that you have to say, enough !

401
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,520
That's right. It's like that Einstein
quote you sometimes see on Internet:

402
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,680
"the definition of insanity is doing
the same thing over and over again"

403
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,720
"and expecting different results."

404
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:27,760
Except Einstein didn't say that.
Because memes aren't facts.

405
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,360
If you won't take that from me,
take it from this smart-looking cat.

406
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,720
That hum of doubt
is hard to shake off.

407
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,000
Some parents agree with the president
and they favor hedging their bets,

408
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,720
and skipping or spacing vaccines out,
just in case.

409
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,000
93 percent of pediatricians

410
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,840
say they've been asked
by parents to do that.

411
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,840
And one of the places that that idea
may be coming from

412
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,880
is a pediatrician
named Dr. Sears.

413
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,440
Not Bill Sears, the famous doctor
and author, but his son: Bob Sears.

414
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,640
Dr. Bob has made a name
for himself with what can seem

415
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,240
like a sensible approach
to address worried parents' concern.

416
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,520
I've put together
my alternative vaccine schedule.

417
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,760
It's a way to get
a baby fully vaccinated,

418
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,920
but in a manner that spreads
the shots out a little bit.

419
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,920
And that sounds
like a decent compromise.

420
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,400
It's the middle
ground position, right ?

421
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,760
The middle ground between
sense and nonsense.

422
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,720
It's like saying, it would be crazy
to eat that entire bar of soap,

423
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,400
so I'll just eat half of it.

424
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,840
Enthusiasm for spacing vaccines
out stems from some parents' belief

425
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,880
that children these days
get too many shots, too soon,

426
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,360
perhaps best summed up by
this meme of a doll full of needles.

427
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,360
If that's how they were given,
I would oppose that.

428
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,520
Let's break that fear down.

429
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,360
While children do receive more
shots than they used to,

430
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,800
the number of antigens
in those shots

431
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,640
or the substances that
induce the immune response

432
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,480
has greatly decreased, and
it's a drop in the ocean

433
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,800
compared to the thousands of foreign
antigens a child encounters every day.

434
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,600
Watch a child for five minutes and see
if they don't eat friend's boogers,

435
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,320
put their entire mouth
over the water fountain

436
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,960
or try to kiss a raccoon
they just found in a dumpster.

437
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,920
My point is:
children are fucking disgusting.

438
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:34,000
Sears admitted his approach is not
based on scientific research.

439
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:39,240
Where is the published,
peer-reviewed evidence

440
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,120
to support the notion of
a, quote, overload,

441
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,440
if you follow
the CDC-recommended schedule ?

442
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,640
Chris, I don't think there
is any such research

443
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,040
and I actually
never claimed there was.

444
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,800
I have put out there clearly
in my writings

445
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,960
that my precautions on spreading
out vaccines are theoretical.

446
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,000
It's a theoretical benefit to kids
and it's a choice

447
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,800
that a lot of parents
feel more comfortable about

448
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,640
and might bring more parents
to vaccinate

449
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:14,080
if they spread the shots out
more than the regular schedule.

450
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,920
Except your job is to make sure
children don't get deadly diseases,

451
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,920
not to make parents comfortable.

452
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,720
You're a pediatrician,

453
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,480
not a flask of whiskey
tucked into a baby Bjorn.

454
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,560
Dr. Bob sometimes seems
to be trying to have it both ways.

455
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,160
While he says he is pro-vaccine
and that he doesn't tell parents

456
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,240
to skip or delay important shots,
his book just happens to include

457
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:45,840
an alternative vaccine schedule
and a selective vaccine schedule.

458
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,680
And on that one,
you can get vaccinated for measles

459
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,360
as late as ten years old.

460
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,920
Every once in a while,
he'll drop a line like this.

461
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,000
My statement I like to make
on vaccines and autism

462
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,560
is that vaccines don't cause
autism, except when they do.

463
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,040
I know that sounds like
equivocating bullshit, but:

464
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,440
opportunistic quacks writing books
that fan flames of people's fears

465
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,880
don't cause a legitimate public health
hazard... except when they do.

466
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,800
While the benefits of Dr. Sears' plan
are, as he says, theoretical,

467
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,640
the dangers of spacing vaccines
out are very real.

468
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,120
CDC says spreading shots out
puts children at risk

469
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,720
of developing diseases during
the time that shots are delayed.

470
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,040
Some of those diseases
are dangerous.

471
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:46,960
Measles was responsible for over
130 000 deaths worldwide in 2015,

472
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,280
partly because
it is ridiculously infectious.

473
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,240
I'm talking, "Happy"
by Pharrell infectious.

474
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,840
I just said that, and it's already
stuck in your head now.

475
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,720
Cause I'm happy.
That's how infectious measles is.

476
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,440
One way we can keep measles at bay
is through herd immunity,

477
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,080
the concept whereby, the more
people who are vaccinated,

478
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,760
the harder it is
for a disease to spread.

479
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,800
But the margin for safety there
is smaller than you may think.

480
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,640
Most experts say that the herd
immunity threshold for measles

481
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,480
is around 95 percent.

482
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,400
But when, in France, that dropped
to 89 percent a few years back,

483
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,000
this is what happened.

484
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,920
In 2007, there were around 40 cases
of measles across France.

485
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,840
Then, in 2008, a 10-year-old girl
returned from holiday in Austria.

486
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,560
She went back to school and
played with some friends.

487
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,640
Several days later,
the girls became ill.

488
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,640
The measles infection spread
from district to district,

489
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,960
infecting the susceptible
population.

490
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,880
In 2011, there were fifteen thousand
cases; at least six people died.

491
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,920
Okay so that clip proves
two things:

492
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,960
one, a decrease in herd immunity
can have devastating consequences,

493
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,120
and anything is terrifying

494
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,440
if you play children singing
Frere Jacques underneath it.

495
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,360
I guarantee you that's true.

496
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:24,160
Look at what happens when you add
that underneath this stock footage.

497
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:41,200
No way those kids are not about
to be decapitated by a stop sign.

498
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,320
And if you are thinking, that is
a chance that I'm willing to take.

499
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,800
I'm making this choice for my child,
the thing is, you're not.

500
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,080
You're putting at risk
kids like Rhett Krawitt.

501
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,600
He was diagnosed
with leukemia at age 2,

502
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,880
his immune system was weakened
he couldn't be vaccinated,

503
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,200
meaning if he picked up
a serious disease, it could be fatal.

504
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,160
I'll let his mom
take it from here.

505
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,640
When he was first diagnosed he was
pulled out of society.

506
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:15,440
We avoided highly concentrated
groups of people.

507
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,800
When we went out,
we wore a mask.

508
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:23,600
We did limit his exposure.
We were so excited for the day

509
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,440
when he could start kindergarten
so he could have

510
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,720
that sense of socialization
and community and learning.

511
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,840
A year into remission
and back in school,

512
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,360
Rhett will soon be healthy
enough to be fully vaccinated.

513
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,320
Until then, his life
depends on herd immunity.

514
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,640
Exactly. So by getting vaccinated,
you're helping and protecting

515
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,320
those who are most vulnerable,
like sick people,

516
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,680
and newborns too young
to be vaccinated.

517
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,800
Why would you choose
not to do that ?

518
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,880
I believe Jesus Christ
put it best when he said:

519
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,560
"do you need some sort of wise
quote to convince you on this ?"

520
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,040
Just, like, don't be a dick."

521
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:09,560
I honestly know that
for some people this is still hard.

522
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,040
But what can help is
to try and anchor yourself

523
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,600
to what we know to be true
about the risks of vaccines.

524
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,200
When it comes to autism,
again: there is no link.

525
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,640
And even when it comes
to other serious side effects,

526
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:28,920
it is literally, according to the CDC,
close to one in a million.

527
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,440
I know that in a way
that's not helpful

528
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,880
because every parent thinks
their child is one in a million.

529
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,160
Your child's odds of being
convicted of murder

530
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,320
and eventually executed by
the state are only 1 in 119 012.

531
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,920
And if that makes you feel
even worse, just cheer up:

532
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,000
maybe your child will be one of
those murderers that never gets caught.

533
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,160
They're very smart. Maybe.

534
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,920
Maybe one of the biggest problems
is that when people hear about vaccines

535
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,120
so much of the emphasis is on
non-existence or wildly unlikely harms

536
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,120
and we tend not to talk about
the very tangible good that they do.

537
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:14,800
Nobody is going to post "didn't
get polio again today ! So lit !"

538
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,760
Maybe we kind of should,

539
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,720
it is easy to forget the benefits
of vaccines are enormous.

540
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,760
What we have seen
in the industrialized world

541
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:33,040
is all of the major epidemics,
they've vanished.

542
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:39,040
Moms today have every expectation
that their little baby will live

543
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,520
and not be polished off
by diphtheria, by tetanus,

544
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,640
even, occasionally, by measles.

545
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,800
That is the transformation in young
lives that vaccines have wrought.

546
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,840
And that is a really good point,
only slightly undercut

547
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,160
by him using the phrase
"polished off".

548
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,840
You're talking about babies,
not a rack of ribs.

549
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,000
It comes down to this.
It is likely that at some point,

550
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,160
you may hear scary vaccine stories
from other parents or on the Internet.

551
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,200
It is hard not to be terrified
when you encounter it.

552
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,400
That is partly because parenthood
in general is fucking terrifying.

553
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I'm someone who is scared
of literally everything,

554
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,240
the dark, the light, heights, depths,
confined spaces, wide-open spaces,

555
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,440
strangers, intimacy, spiders,
and a sudden lack of spiders.

556
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:40,440
But for what it's worth
and if this helps at all:

557
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,480
I have a son. He is 19 months old.
He was born prematurely,

558
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,520
and I've worried about his health
and I still worry about his health.

559
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,600
But we are vaccinating him
fully on schedule.

560
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,080
If I can overcome the temptation

561
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,120
to listen to the irrational shouting
of my terrified lizard brain,

562
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,520
then I believe that everyone can.

563
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,160
And now this.

564
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,160
Seriously: the people of Scranton

565
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,400
are very invested
in WNEP 16's backyard train.

566
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,760
Our backyard train continues to be
a debated topic in Talkback 16.

567
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,760
I see Kurt in the backyard, the train
is down to just the locomotives.

568
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,520
What happened to
the passenger cars ?

569
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,120
So much for buying that,
a new train that was supposed

570
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,840
to be indoor, outdoor, weatherproof
with sound and smoke.

571
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,920
You are all talking about
the snowstorm in the backyard

572
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,200
and all I can see is that
poor train engine,

573
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,720
the poor little thing spazzing out,

574
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,960
too worried about his tracks
getting all covered up.

575
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,800
Can you give him a little
home or something ?

576
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,520
I'd like to see that train
running in the backyard,

577
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,000
even with the snow.

578
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:02,080
You get the weathermen out there
to clean that track off.

579
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,600
I turned the news on and
I saw the train running.

580
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,840
I am so happy. Thank you.

581
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,080
I could come through the phone
and give youz all a big hug.

582
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,480
I've been enjoying
the Talkback 16 segments.

583
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:24,440
I think Jon Meyer is the one who
is shutting down the train

584
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:29,600
to distract from the terrible
reviews he's getting on Talkback 16.

585
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,760
It's just another example
of fake news.

586
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,720
That's our show. Thanks for watching.
We'll see you next week. Goodnight !

587
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,640
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

588
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,040
END OF EPISODE 17,
SEASON IV
