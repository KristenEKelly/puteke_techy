LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,840
Season IV
Episode 16

3
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,000
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,080
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,880
It has been another
bewilderingly busy week:

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,280
Sessions testified, Trump seemingly
admitted he was under investigation,

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,080
Republican politicians
were shot at by an idiot,

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,080
a terrible verdict
in the Philando Castile trial

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,440
and no verdict
in the Bill Cosby one,

10
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,880
a case which supplied us with one
of the single weirdest moments.

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,160
After 12 hours at the courthouse
outside Philadelphia,

12
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,360
he yelled out his famous
Fat Albert catch phrase.

13
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,680
What are you doing ?

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,960
Shouting your character's catchphrase
while on trial is a bizarre choice.

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,080
If RenÃ©e Zellweger was
on trial for triple murder,

16
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,360
it would be strange for her to shout,
you had me at hello.

17
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,560
We had you when the blood in
the trunk turned out to be a DNA match.

18
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,720
You're going to jail
for a long time.

19
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,560
Let's not talk about Cosby.
But about a different terrible bill:

20
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,640
the American Health Care Act,
which answers the question:

21
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,960
what if a bus-stop ad for a personal
injury lawyer was a healthcare policy ?

22
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,840
This has been buried
by other news,

23
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,640
but Senate Republicans have been
quietly working on a new version.

24
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,440
A task complicated
by a surprising new critic.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,080
Associated Press saying
that Trump told Senators

26
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,320
that the House bill is,
quote: "mean".

27
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,880
Yes, the President called
the bill "mean".

28
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,440
Presumably folded his arms,
stamped on the ground,

29
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,240
screamed til he tuckered himself out,
and fell asleep on the floor.

30
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,160
Nap it off, big guy.

31
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,720
That's a little hard to hear,
coming from a man who celebrated

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,720
that mean bill's passage
at a Rose Garden ceremony.

33
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,320
Perhaps he knows this bill
is incredibly unpopular.

34
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,360
One analysis found it doesn't enjoy
a plurality of support in any state.

35
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,320
Which is amazing ! You can't get
all 50 states to agree on anything.

36
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,920
You can only get 49 states
to admit that Delaware sucks.

37
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,520
And the holdout,
by the way: Minnesota.

38
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,920
They're just too nice
to admit the obvious !

39
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,320
Republican Senators say
their bill will be gentler.

40
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,240
But it is hard to know that,
very few people have seen it

41
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,680
and they're planning to bypass
the committee hearing,

42
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,000
limiting the amount of changes
that can be made.

43
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,720
They seem unprepared for
the pushback they've been getting.

44
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,040
Will we have a hearing
on the healthcare proposal ?

45
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,720
- Will we ?
- Yes.

46
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,920
We've already had one...

47
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,520
On the proposal you are planning
to bring to the floor of the Senate.

48
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,040
Will there be a hearing ?

49
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,800
Democrats have been invited
to participate in this process

50
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,480
and we are open
to all ideas and suggestions.

51
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,040
I don't know that there's
going to be another hearing,

52
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,600
but we've invited you...

53
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,880
That is pathetic.

54
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,000
He should not have lines fed to him
when he already looks like a...

55
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,400
Ventriloquist dummy of Mike Pence,
you fucking idiot.

56
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,920
A ventriloquist dummy
of Mike Pence, you fucking idiot.

57
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,480
Thank you, Juli.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But all this mystery and secrecy
has a real cost.

59
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,520
Insurers decide whether
to be part of the Obamacare exchanges

60
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,200
and the situation
is making things difficult.

61
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,800
Listen to a representative from
the Insurance Commissioners.

62
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,080
It comes down to the biggest
problem we have, uncertainty.

63
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,760
I think everybody will agree,
insurance hates uncertainty.

64
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah, of course. They like
consistency and predictability.

65
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,080
This is an industry where a duck has
been a spokesperson for 18 years.

66
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,360
That uncertainty is taking a toll.

67
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,600
Anthem pulled out of the Obamacare
marketplace in Ohio,

68
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,120
citing continual changes in federal
operations, rules and guidance.

69
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,640
That will happen when no one knows
what the law is even going to be.

70
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,240
One of the prime drivers of this chaos
seems oddly cavalier about that news

71
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,000
and also the prospect
of people losing coverage.

72
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,800
Yesterday we learned that the last
statewide insurer in Ohio is leaving.

73
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,400
Have you heard about that ?
That's it. Bye-bye, wave goodbye.

74
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,200
What a mess.

75
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,760
We need to remember that sentence.
Because those may be the exact words

76
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,600
that Trump uses one day as mushroom
cloud explodes across America:

77
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,280
Bye-bye, wave goodbye.
What a mess !

78
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,520
And now this.

79
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,720
And now, things people's
fathers used to say.

80
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,720
There are three things you never
change people's minds on:

81
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,000
politics, baseball and sex.

82
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,320
My dad used to say, at times in life,
it's important to call an ace, an ace.

83
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,200
My dad used to say, son,
don't look very far up the family tree.

84
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,680
There's some stuff
you don't need to see.

85
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,320
My dad said: if you
draw a circle and shut me out,

86
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,640
I'll draw a bigger circle
and shut you in.

87
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,280
My daddy used to say, it's Wednesday
all day long unless it rains.

88
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,040
I never did know what
would happen if it rained.

89
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,440
I guess it would just be
rainy Wednesday.

90
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,040
As my dad used to say,
them are the rules.

91
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,000
As my daddy used to say,
you gonn' have that.

92
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,040
You can't
tell the players without a program.

93
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,280
Congress is always in session.

94
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,880
There lies the body of Jonathan Gray,
who died defending his right of way.

95
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,040
As my dad used to say,
dogs don't bark at parked cars.

96
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,160
That is very profound.

97
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,640
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns coal.

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,640
Basically, cocaine
for Thomas the Tank Engine.

99
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,520
We heard a lot about coal this year,
particularly from President Trump.

100
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,200
A reason that we have this cautionary
Bible story in the White House

101
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,280
was his ability to connect with
mining communities in campaign,

102
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,240
even doing this in West Virginia.

103
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,680
Nice ! I'll put it on, right ?

104
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,320
Okay,
let me stop you right there.

105
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,960
It is not easy watching someone
I doubt has done a day of hard labor

106
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,440
show how he thinks
coal mining works.

107
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,680
It's like watching
a four year old play store.

108
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,080
You hand them your duckie and
then you get cookies, ya idiot.

109
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,920
What that crowd remembered
was how Trump's speech ended.

110
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,720
We'll start winning and you
are going to be very proud,

111
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,240
and for those miners, you're
gonna be working your asses off !

112
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,240
Thank you, everybody.

113
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,240
You're gonna be working
your asses off ! Like that, right ?

114
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,920
Maybe some of this you'll do ?
Or maybe this ?

115
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,840
You're mimers, right ? You're
going back to the coal mimes ?

116
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
I don't know
what you people do.

117
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,840
Trump promising to bring back coal
jobs is undeniably potent.

118
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,520
To listen to his EPA administrator,
it's a promise he's keeping.

119
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,840
Since last, fourth quarter of last year
added 50 000 jobs in the coal sector.

120
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,520
In the month of May,
almost 7 000 jobs.

121
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,080
So the only problem there is
that those numbers are bullshit.

122
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,480
Bureau of Labor Statistics
says the number of coal jobs created

123
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,240
has been just 1 300.

124
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,640
So that 50 000 new jobs claim was off
by 48 700.

125
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,600
Which for this administration
is uncharacteristically accurate.

126
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,480
I'd just assumed that the figure
would be more like 12 mining jobs

127
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,240
and they're not actually jobs,
they're lobsters

128
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,000
and Trump didn't create them,

129
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,280
he just remembers 12 times
in his life that he saw a lobster.

130
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,440
Trump claims coal is a huge
priority for his White House.

131
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,720
Let's set aside tonight the fact that
it is environmentally catastrophic,

132
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,800
which we shouldn't,
because it is.

133
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,120
This President
doesn't care about that.

134
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,840
He pulled out of the Paris Agreement
citing coal,

135
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,120
lifted a freeze on new coal
leases on public lands

136
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,280
revoked a rule to limit companies
from dumping debris in local streams,

137
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,440
with miners behind him
both times.

138
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,520
If coal jobs are so important
to him, let's talk about them.

139
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,760
Let's begin with a number,
it is smaller than you might think.

140
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,680
While Trump has talked
about reviving the coal industry,

141
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,840
which employs 76 000 people,
retailer JC Penney,

142
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,920
on the verge of bankruptcy,
employs 114 000 alone.

143
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,920
For a start: I didn't even know that
JC Penney had employees anymore.

144
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,640
I thought anyone who walked
into a JC Penney was handed the keys

145
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,680
saying; here, see if you can
make it work, good luck !

146
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,760
76 000 coal workers
is less than you'd expect.

147
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,440
In areas where they are concentrated,
coal mines are central to community.

148
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,960
Some schools have miners as mascots
for their sports teams,

149
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,040
or even, they have
coal industry sponsored fairs

150
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,600
where kids make a variety of projects,
perhaps none as awesome as this one.

151
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,240
It's about a lump of coal
named Lumpy

152
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,960
on a journey to figure out what
he's gonna be and what he could be

153
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,840
when he "grows up".

154
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,120
I love that kid. And by the way
top-notch use of air quotes there.

155
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,440
You and I both know that
Lumpy is not going to "grow up".

156
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,600
Lumpy is going to live
a short life underground

157
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,240
until one day
his friends notice he's missing.

158
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,200
Where's Lumpy ? They'll say.
Has anyone seen Lumpy ?

159
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,840
They'll form search parties and
put posters up around town.

160
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,440
But, in their minds, they know
the truth. They've always known.

161
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,440
One day there's a knock at the door.
The news they've all been dreading.

162
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,400
Lumpy has been burned to death
in a horrifying ritual

163
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,400
alongside the entire Lump family.

164
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,160
This is why we don't name them !
Because then we get attached.

165
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,840
When coal jobs go away,
communities feel it,

166
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,240
because these jobs
are high-paying.

167
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,120
A coal miner can make
upwards of $80 000.

168
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,960
So that's not easy to replace.

169
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,240
The industry points much of the blame
for lost jobs at President Obama,

170
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,960
with one of the loudest voices
being this guy.

171
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,600
These are my employees.
I care for them deeply.

172
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,560
Barack Obama and his followers are
destroying segments of America.

173
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,680
Mr. Obama is an outlaw. I pray
every day that this man's incompetence

174
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,920
will be overcome, that his evil
agenda will be overcome.

175
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,320
When you have a 52-year-old coal miner
in your office crying

176
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,600
because you were forced
to lay him off,

177
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,080
that's what Obama has never
seen because he's never had a job.

178
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,000
What are you talking about ?
He had a job.

179
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,360
His job was destroying segments
of America with his evil incompetence

180
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,840
or his name was not
"Barick" Obama.

181
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That man was Bob Murray,
the CEO of Murray Energy.

182
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,480
His claim that Obama's
regulations have been job killers

183
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,960
is worth taking a look at.

184
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,400
While coal mining jobs undoubtedly
did decline under Obama,

185
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,600
it's worth noting coal mining jobs
have also been declining for decades.

186
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,040
Look at that trend line.
Coal industry jobs declined

187
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,400
at the same rate as careers
in the Zeppelin industry

188
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,720
and babies named Adolf.

189
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,960
Some still exist ! There's just
not nearly as many of them anymore.

190
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm not saying Obama's
regulations had no effect.

191
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,960
Researchers found
they had very little impact.

192
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,760
Studying the decline in expected
demand for coal from a decade ago,

193
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,560
they found that nearly half
of that drop was owing

194
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,880
to the drop in natural gas prices
and another 18 percent

195
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,400
was due to the growth in renewable
energy, like wind and solar.

196
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,680
No more dramatic evidence of coal
losing out to solar energy than this.

197
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,440
Work has begun to power
the Kentucky Coal Mining Museum

198
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,720
not by coal,
but by the sun.

199
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,840
This project will help save
at least 8 to 10 000 dollars

200
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,200
off of the energy costs
on this building.

201
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,520
Kentucky Coal Mining Museum
is now using solar energy.

202
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,840
It's like finding out
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

203
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,800
was brought to you
by Smash Mouth.

204
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,560
Even if consumption
wasn't declining,

205
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,880
companies would be cutting jobs, they
are replacing miners with machines.

206
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,680
You had all this mechanization
going on with people leaving,

207
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,920
but its come to the point now where
they dont do underground mining

208
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,560
if they can get away with it.

209
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,440
They do mountaintop removals
and surface mining.

210
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,520
You can mine
a whole mountainside.

211
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,920
I'm talking about a whole mountainside
within a year or two,

212
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,240
with around 7 to 12 people,
that's all you need.

213
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,720
Mining, like almost all industries,
is facing increased automation.

214
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,600
I say that well aware
that in five to ten years

215
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,280
I am probably going to be replaced
by a robotic English teakettle

216
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,840
that screams depressing
money stats at you.

217
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,160
The rise of alternative energies
is good thing for the earth as a whole.

218
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,400
As coal jobs go away,
new green jobs are opening up.

219
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,080
Which is true,
but not where coal miners live.

220
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,360
West Virginia and Kentucky rank near
the bottom in solar jobs per capita.

221
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,320
For the people who've faced layoffs,
the future can look bleak.

222
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,720
It's depressing when you have kids
and you go to work one day,

223
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,280
and they say:
"you don't work here no more".

224
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,000
You gotta go home and...

225
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,800
Face your family and say
you don't have the job.

226
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:43,520
That is devastating. It does not help
someone in his situation

227
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,880
to be told statistics by someone
like me, in a TV studio,

228
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,160
who doesn't have the skills or
muscle mass to be a miner

229
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,440
and who looks like the result
of a drunk threesome between

230
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,760
Chris Hayes, Austin Powers
and a potato.

231
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,880
I know that,
but the question is:

232
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,040
what does help someone
in that situation ?

233
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,960
Trump insists that he's helping miners
by reducing regulations on companies.

234
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,600
People conflate coal,
coal miners and coal companies

235
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,480
and imply that when you help one,
you help them all.

236
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,080
But they are not
all in the same boat,

237
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,400
although they may insist otherwise.

238
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,240
When the coal company
Alpha Natural Resources

239
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,640
filed for bankruptcy, their CEO
stressed how painful that was.

240
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,560
- Are more mine closures possible ?
- They are, unfortunately.

241
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,400
And for Crutchfield, that's clearly
the hardest part of it all.

242
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,080
When I asked him about this photo
displayed at Alpha headquarters,

243
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,560
a photo called "Daddy's hands",
emotions were hard to hold back.

244
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,880
That is the backbone of America.
And we have that photograph

245
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,360
just to remind everybody
who we serve.

246
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,640
That's a nice sentiment,
slightly undercut by the fact that,

247
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,600
Alpha asked its bankruptcy trustee
if it could

248
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,800
save $3 million by terminating
the health and life insurance benefits

249
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,760
of around 1 200 retirees,
seeking permission to pay bonuses

250
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:17,880
up to around $12 million to top
executives, including that guy.

251
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,560
Which is the sort of thing that
might make "Daddy's hands"

252
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,400
want to do
something like this.

253
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,080
You wouldn't really
blame them for that.

254
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,600
Coal CEOs constantly claim to workers
that it's "us against them".

255
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,760
Don Blankenship,
ex-CEO of Massey Energy,

256
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,440
once held a rally featuring Ted Nugent,
Hank Williams Jr.

257
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,120
and a rousing speech
from Blankenship himself.

258
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,040
The safety and health of coal miners
is my most important job.

259
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,760
I don't need politicians to tell me
that, and neither do you.

260
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,240
Okay, so, speech aside,
that's a hell of a look.

261
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,440
It takes a brave man to go for
half-Kerri Strug

262
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,120
and half-the 'time to make
the doughnuts" guy.

263
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:10,120
If you thought the presence of a man
who's been ejaculated on by a flag

264
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,760
was as upsetting as that rally could
get, guess who else was there ?

265
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,360
We believe in God, right ?
Faith ? Family ? Country ?

266
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,760
We believe America's a shining
city on a hill, right ?

267
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,480
We believe in freedom ?
How you doin', doc ?

268
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,280
There's a really hot looking chick
in the third row there.

269
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,640
I'll take you back stage to meet
Hank a little later if you want.

270
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,480
You wanna meet me later ?

271
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,640
What the fuck was that ?
In the course of his speech,

272
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,600
he referenced God, quoted Reagan
and engaged in sexual harassment.

273
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,360
That man really is FOX News.

274
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,880
Just a few months after his rally
against Washington's safety rules,

275
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,920
Blankenship's company had a massive
explosion, killing 29 miners.

276
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,480
Blankenship denies responsibility.
In the wake of that disaster,

277
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,800
he was sentenced to a year in prison
for conspiring to violate mine safety.

278
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,040
He just got out
and now has to rebuild his life,

279
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:23,200
with nothing but his estimated
golden parachute of $86 million.

280
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,880
That will help you
get back on your feet.

281
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,320
$86 million will help you get back
on anyone's feet.

282
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,080
You want to get back on Fred Astaire's
feet ? That's no problem.

283
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,440
For $86 million, grab a hacksaw,
we are digging up Fred !

284
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,440
Blankenship is lobbying
the Trump administration

285
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,840
to oppose more onerous criminal laws
for mine owners, saying

286
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,960
they "will not improve
mine safety".

287
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,720
I'd like to think Trump
would not listen to him.

288
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,640
Because
he loves the miners so much.

289
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,680
But there's not much evidence of that.
What there is evidence of,

290
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,880
is his affection for mine CEOs.

291
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,280
His secretary of commerce
is Wilbur Ross,

292
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,600
who ran the company that had
the deadly Sago Mine disaster.

293
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,720
He's also close to that man
you saw earlier, Bob Murray,

294
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,520
who claims that Trump called him
to deliver a special message.

295
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,040
He said, tell your coal miners
I've got their back.

296
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,600
And then he said:
"I love you man".

297
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,840
Congratulations on that, Bob !
You're now in the very select group

298
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,320
that Donald Trump
has said "I love you" to,

299
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,160
along with, presumably,
the worst Baldwin,

300
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,280
exactly one of his two daughters
and the holloweyed business ghost

301
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,800
that greets him
in the mirror every morning.

302
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,640
And Murray illustrates the divide
that can exist between

303
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,680
a coal company's interests
and those of its workers.

304
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,800
I'll be careful, because,
when we contacted Murray Energy,

305
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,160
they sent us a letter
instructing us to

306
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,160
"cease and desist to defame, harass
or injure Mr. Murray or Murray Energy"

307
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,600
telling us: "failure to do so will
result in immediate litigation".

308
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,720
A "cease and desist" letter is
something we've never received.

309
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,200
Not even the nation of New Zealand
has sent us one,

310
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:15,680
and we wallaby-kick those "Iminim"
burglars in the balls every week.

311
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,280
I have to proceed with caution.
I'm not going to say, for instance,

312
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,120
that Bob Murray looks like
a geriatric Dr. Evil,

313
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,160
even though he clearly does.

314
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,200
Murray Energy has sued people.

315
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,000
Just last month they sued
the New York Times for libel.

316
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,840
They also sued everyone from
a contributor to the Huffington Post

317
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,480
to these two papers in Ohio.

318
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,240
Murray's current general counsel
told reporters that this paper

319
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,560
inflicted a potential economic loss of
"one billion dollars".

320
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,360
It's exactly what you'd expect
from a geriatric Dr. Evil.

321
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,040
Though Murray Energy insisted
that they only sue news outlets

322
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,880
"as a matter of last resort"
and "never to chill free speech",

323
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,520
they might pursue our damages
to the fullest extent of the law,

324
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,200
including to the level
of the Supreme Court of the US.

325
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,040
That would be a real mistake, we have
a relationship with those judges.

326
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,840
Fun fact: if you scratch Justice Alito
behind his ear, he pees on the floor.

327
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,760
That's true of the dog
and the man.

328
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:31,120
As we have been explicitly
told to "cease and desist",

329
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:36,040
let us do neither of those things
and let's talk about Bob Murray.

330
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:42,200
He often speaks on TV
in defense of coal workers.

331
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:47,520
But let's take a look at his actions.
Murray's company unsuccessfully sued

332
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,080
to block a rule aimed at reducing
miners' exposure to coal dust

333
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,120
that causes black lung,
a disease which killed as many

334
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,280
as 10 000 people
between 1995 and 2005.

335
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:04,360
Murray insisted the rule was illegal,
did nothing for miners, for health.

336
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,520
Last year, with the rule in effect,
government reports indicated

337
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,400
respirable dust levels
fell to historic lows.

338
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,600
If you even appear to be
on the same side as black lung,

339
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,720
you're on the wrong
fucking side.

340
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,360
That's the equivalent of watching
"My Girl" and rooting for the bees.

341
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,720
Some of Murray's employees
clashed with the company over safety.

342
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,440
Murray proposed a program where
miners could receive bonuses

343
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,960
based on the amount
of coal they extracted.

344
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,880
It was voted down by employees

345
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,840
who believed it would have an adverse
impact on safety in the mines.

346
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,280
The company did it anyway,
saying if workers didn't like it,

347
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,960
they could just write
"void" on their checks.

348
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:51,400
62 employees did just that,
with two going even further,

349
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,640
one returning a check for $11.58
by writing "kiss my ass, Bob" on it

350
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,680
and another taking a check
for $3.22 and writing:

351
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,160
"Eat shit, Bob."

352
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,360
Well-played, miners. Because you
could've sent that message on a cake

353
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,720
or you could have sent it on
a bear with a big stuffed heart,

354
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,920
but to write it
on your $3 bonus check ?

355
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,760
Well-played to you, sirs.

356
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,560
There was the deadly collapse at
the Crandall Canyon Mine in Utah.

357
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,040
Murray attracted attention
for a bizarre press conference

358
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,680
in which he was making bold claims
about the cause of the accident.

359
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,720
This is the first major accident
I've ever had in one of my mines

360
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,160
in 20 years of being in existence,
the first major accident.

361
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,920
And this was caused
by an earthquake,

362
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,640
not something that Murray Energy,
or Utah American did,

363
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,640
or our employees
or our management.

364
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,800
So here is the interesting
thing about that:

365
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,760
to this day, Murray says
that the evidence proves

366
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,040
"he was correct that an earthquake
caused the collapse."

367
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,720
That was not the conclusion
of the government's investigation,

368
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,760
which found it was caused
by unauthorized practices

369
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,360
and there was no evidence that
an earthquake caused the collapse.

370
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,200
Murray does not want us talking
about the accident, saying:

371
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,400
"it was an incredibly
difficult time for the families".

372
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,440
Though he was unable to satisfy the
expectations of the family members,

373
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,560
he says "he showed them honesty,
sincerity and compassion".

374
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:33,320
According to a Department
of Labor investigation,

375
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,560
their pain was exacerbated
by Murray's behavior

376
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,440
while they waited
news of their loved ones.

377
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:45,440
All we heard was earthquake. We did
not want to hear about earthquakes

378
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,080
but wanted to know when we were
going to see our loved ones again.

379
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,680
Murray more than once yelled
at us when we asked questions.

380
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,000
Yelling at distraught families when
they ask questions is not okay.

381
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,920
It is barely okay
to do it with five year olds

382
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,200
and they ask
over 42 million questions a day.

383
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,480
"Why are birds ?" is not a question
I know the fucking answer to.

384
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,600
Google it !

385
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,640
And there is one more Bob Murray
story I'd like you to know about.

386
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,240
It's an apocryphal tale concerning
how the company began.

387
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,200
Union miners claim that Murray
used to tell them that

388
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,480
"he was sitting on his porch,
contemplating his future,"

389
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,160
"when he was approached by
a squirrel, who looked him in the eye"

390
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,280
"and said: Bob Murray, you should be
operating your very own mines."

391
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,800
We asked Murray's
company about that story

392
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,040
and they told us:
"it never occurred".

393
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,880
I actually believe Murray on that one.
I think deep down we all know,

394
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,600
if squirrels could talk, they
wouldn't be giving career advice.

395
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,880
They'd be listing their favorite nuts:
okay, let's go.

396
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,760
Acorns, chestnuts, walnuts,
almonds, cashews are good,

397
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,200
although of course
technically not a nut.

398
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,720
Brazil nuts not my favorite
but I wouldn't kick 'em out of bed.

399
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,600
Do ya feel this ?

400
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,320
Back to jobs: Murray argues he provided
thousands to mining communities.

401
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:28,080
And for those communities, that
fact might outweigh everything else,

402
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,440
especially if Murray and Trump
can bring coal back.

403
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,400
Even Murray himself
is careful regarding that.

404
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,200
Can those jobs come back
if it's a Donald Trump presidency ?

405
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,320
I don't think they can come back.
But we can stop the destruction.

406
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:49,360
That's what I have told
Mr. Trump. And he gets it.

407
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:56,000
Hang on there, Bob, no he doesn't.
A, he barely gets what mining is.

408
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,760
He may think it's running up to things
that he wants and yelling "mine" !

409
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,840
That's possible.

410
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:10,600
And B, he's told miners they're
going to be working their asses off.

411
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,080
If Trump cares about miners,
he would be putting a plan in place

412
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,600
for their futures as mining
continues its long-term decline.

413
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,160
But he isn't doing that.

414
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,480
There are some small things
being done by others.

415
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:28,360
Bit Source, in Kentucky, is hiring
miners as software programmers

416
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,880
and paying them
through their retraining.

417
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,160
I've learnt numerous code languages,
I've learnt CSS,

418
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:39,440
I've learnt PHP, HTML,
JavaScript, Twig and YAML.

419
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,560
That's impressive. I will ignore the
fact that "Twig & YAML" sounds like

420
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,440
a bootleg Russian DVD knockoff
of "Lilo & Stitch".

421
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,040
That program is encouraging,
but it won't suit everyone.

422
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,400
And at present, it only has
nine jobs for former miners.

423
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,160
Trump is actively hurting
the chances of other projects like it.

424
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,640
His budget proposes cutting funding for
the Appalachian Regional Commission,

425
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,760
which helps revitalize communities
affected by coal mining job losses,

426
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,400
by funding employment programs
that have helped Bit Source.

427
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,960
You might wonder: why would a guy
who says he loves miners do that ?

428
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,840
Read a Playboy interview from 1990,
where he said and I quote:

429
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,280
"if I had been the son of a coal miner,
I would have left the damn mines."

430
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,880
Most people don't have the imagination
or whatever to leave their mine.

431
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,480
They don't have it.

432
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,320
They certainly don't have
what Trump has, specifically,

433
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,400
inherited wealth and hair like
the wispy pubes of an aging Yeti.

434
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:52,640
Trump needs to stop lying
to coal miners. We all do.

435
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,640
Stop telling them that their jobs
are all coming back when they're not.

436
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,560
Stop telling them that coal is clean,
when it isn't.

437
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,800
Stop pretending that this isn't
an industry in the middle

438
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,000
of a difficult, painful,
albeit necessary transition.

439
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,000
An honest conversation about coal
and its miners needs to be had,

440
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,720
and we should neither cease
nor desist from having it.

441
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,520
Which reminds me: one more
thing here. Bob Murray.

442
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,720
I didn't really plan for so much
of this piece to be about you,

443
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,000
but you forced my hand
on that one.

444
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,080
I know that you are
probably going to sue me.

445
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,760
I stand by everything I said.
Although just to reiterate:

446
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,840
I do not think you claimed
a squirrel talked to you.

447
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,560
Even by your standard, that would be
a pretty ridiculous thing to say.

448
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,200
I believe that you have never been
spoken to by a squirrel.

449
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,880
Until, that is, tonight.

450
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,400
Look, Bob ! Look !

451
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:56,160
It's Mr. Nutterbutter, Bob !
Look, Bob, look !

452
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,400
- It's Mr. Nutterbutter ! Hi !
- Hi, John!

453
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,720
I understand that you have
a message for Bob Murray ?

454
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,880
- I do !
- Okay !

455
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,560
Hey, Bob ! Just wanted to say,
if you're planning on suing,

456
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,480
I do not have a billion dollars,

457
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,880
but I do have a check for
three acorns and eighteen cents !

458
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,760
- Very nice of you Mr. Nutterbutter.
- It is.

459
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:27,720
It's made out to "Eat Shit, Bob".
Memo line: "Kiss My Ass".

460
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,560
Thank you, Mr. Nutterbutter !

461
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,240
That's our show !
See you next week ! Good night !

462
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,800
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

463
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,160
END OF EPISODE 16,
SEASON IV
