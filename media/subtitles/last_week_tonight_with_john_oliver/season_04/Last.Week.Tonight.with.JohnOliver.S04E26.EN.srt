LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,920
Season IV
Episode 26

3
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,920
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,000
Thank you for joining us.
A quick recap of the week,

5
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,400
which has been hectic and depressing,
from mass shooting in Las Vegas,

6
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,320
to the battle
over Catalan independence,

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,760
to the ongoing recovery from
Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.

8
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,240
Or, as our president insisted
on pronouncing it this week.

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,240
We are also praying
for the people of Puerto Rico.

10
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,080
We love Puerto Rico.

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,160
No. Nobody loves anything
and still says its name like that.

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,120
If I ask you if you feel like Italian
and you say:

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,680
"let us order some spaghetti".

14
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,600
I love "spaghetti",
then you don't love spaghetti,

15
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,840
you hate Italians, and we're
not having dinner together.

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,280
Trump was not the only world
leader to malfunction this week.

17
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,400
In the UK, Theresa May
addressed her party conference,

18
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,880
hoping to quell a revolt
by demonstrating strong leadership.

19
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,520
So how did that go ?

20
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,320
Nearly an hour into her speech,
the sign behind her head

21
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,320
began falling apart,
one letter at a time.

22
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,240
That is not a good sign.
That literally wasn't a good sign.

23
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,480
Not everything
I say has to be a joke.

24
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,960
I'm allowed to just say true
things sometimes. I'm allowed.

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,400
We marked the one-year anniversary
of the Access Hollywood tape

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,480
with grim stories concerning
the treatment of women.

27
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,320
The Times published a massive
expose detailing

28
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,480
movie executive Harvey Weinstein's
years of alleged sexual harassment.

29
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,160
His response was infuriating,
he and his attorneys admitted

30
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,760
he needs help, while denying charges
and threatening to sue the Times.

31
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,440
And on top of that was this.

32
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,800
Weinstein says in part:
"I came of age in '60s and '70s"

33
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,800
"when all the rules about behavior
in the workplaces were different."

34
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,360
"I have
since learned it's not an excuse."

35
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,800
Your excuse isn't an excuse.
In fact, it isn't even an excuse

36
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,920
for that behavior in the '60s.

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,960
We had no idea women didn't want
to be forced to look at dicks !

38
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,320
That wasn't discovered by
scientists until 1998 !

39
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,960
It was a different time !

40
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,760
New stories are coming out, including
an allegation from one local reporter

41
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,240
that Weinstein trapped her, tried
to kiss her and when she refused,

42
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,840
he exposed himself before ejaculating
quickly into a potted plant.

43
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,640
Step aside, "Chocolat", you are
no longer the most horrifying picture

44
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,040
that Harvey Weinstein
has ever produced !

45
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,440
Donald Trump,
the Harvey Weinstein of presidents,

46
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,120
had his own surprise
for women this week.

47
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,320
This is a story
that could affect a lot of women.

48
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,320
A change to an insurance mandate
means birth control

49
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,080
may no longer be covered.

50
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,160
Employers can stop offering
free birth control,

51
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,480
if they have a sincerely held
religious or moral objection to it.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,080
Trump administration is making
it easier for employers

53
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,640
to stop covering employees'
birth control,

54
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,960
or, as Mike Pence would put it,
they:

55
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,640
"defend the right of future babies
to continue"

56
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,000
"through the male sin stick and
into a woman's motherhole."

57
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,360
On top of all of this, there has been
chaos in the White House,

58
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,920
particularly surrounding
secretary of state, Rex Tillerson,

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,320
a man who in every photo looks like
he sold someone a Weber Grill.

60
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,320
It seems that relations between
Tillerson and the president

61
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,920
have hit an all-time low.

62
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,600
A report rocketing around Washington.
NBC News reporting

63
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,120
Tillerson had called Trump
a "moron".

64
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,680
Yeah, a moron.
State Department denied that report,

65
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,840
which prompted NBC to issue
a crucial clarification

66
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,840
that he'd actually called him
a fucking moron.

67
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,400
Which led
to this amazing TV debate.

68
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,400
- Was it moron or fing moron ?
- It's unclear.

69
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,640
I feel there is
a little bit of a difference.

70
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,160
It was definitely moron.

71
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,760
This is the type of discussion
we now have on TV:

72
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,600
does the secretary of state think
the president is a moron

73
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,840
or a fucking moron ?

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,640
If it's just "moron",
that makes him a moderate.

75
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,960
The breakdown in this relationship
is very funny.

76
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,240
It could have
serious consequences.

77
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,000
Foreign powers
may not negotiate with a diplomat

78
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,760
they don't believe
has the president's support.

79
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,080
If Tillerson goes,
he might not go alone.

80
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,720
There is, quote, a reported suicide
pact forged between Mattis,

81
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,240
Mnuchin and Tillerson whereby
all three cabinet secretaries

82
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,320
vow to leave if the president
makes moves against one of them.

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,960
Apparently, these three
cabinet members have a pact

84
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,800
to quit
if one of them is fired.

85
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,160
Which makes sense,
except... Mnuchin ?

86
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,360
He's sexy, yeah,
the guy's a perfect ten,

87
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,080
but we all agree on that,
but Mnuchin threatening to resign

88
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,120
is a bit like a bee threatening
to fly out of a car.

89
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,680
Okay. Fucking go, then.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,280
That instability within
the administration is more concerning,

91
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,800
given the terrifying statement
the president gave this week.

92
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,760
President raised eyebrows
with this comment

93
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,040
about the military leaders
he invited to the White House.

94
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,920
- Do you know what this represents ?
- Tell us, sir.

95
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,240
Maybe it's the calm
before the storm.

96
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,480
- What's the storm ?
- The calm before the storm.

97
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,200
- What storm, Mr. President ?
- You'll find out.

98
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,720
What are you talking about ?

99
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,280
No moment in the preceding nine
months has been remotely calm.

100
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,320
It's like we are two hours
into a Slipknot concert

101
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,040
and they said: "enough ballads,
we're gonna play one that rocks."

102
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,200
He could mean decertifying
the Iran nuclear deal.

103
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,320
It could mean launching
all-out war with North Korea.

104
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,680
It could mean a military
strike on Puerto Rico.

105
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,720
Or it could mean nothing.
I am quoting the secretary of state,

106
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,360
these are his words, it is vulgar
and I do not approve this language,

107
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,560
our president is
a "fucking moron."

108
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,240
And now, this.

109
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,320
And now, dicks.

110
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,240
This construction is happening
along North Michigan,

111
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,400
starting at Houghten Avenue
and going all the way to State Avenue.

112
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,640
Then those storms will
move up to the north and the east.

113
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,080
And then this year,
the places that just don't have snow.

114
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,400
We're gonna be seeing a lot of
the energy that continue to climb up.

115
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,320
Temperatures are going to be
a few degrees higher.

116
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,360
We've got that forecast going,
shows you that it stays off the...

117
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,040
Watch the precipitation.
Some will head towards the west.

118
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,480
You can see him spraying
some kind of...

119
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,240
I don't know if it's a picture
or a message.

120
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,360
This is my crude version
of a map of the United States.

121
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,280
How does this play out ?

122
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,800
A cannon !

123
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,040
- I don't know.
- What do you do ?

124
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,960
These you can buy,
and those ones, I made.

125
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,960
- Using your hand or...
- What'd I just make there ?

126
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,520
Moving on.
Before our main story tonight,

127
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,360
I'd like to quickly tell you about
a beloved icon of my childhood

128
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,640
and it's this man.

129
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,520
For twenty years, he made
the dreams of young people come true,

130
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,880
with his hugely popular
"Jim'll Fix It" program.

131
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,040
Best known for his trademark
jewelry, track suits, tinted glasses

132
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,560
and Havana cigar.

133
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,680
That bizarre-looking man,
Jimmy Savile, was a national hero.

134
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,560
We named places for him,
we gave him a knighthood,

135
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,480
we even put up
this statue of him.

136
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,480
It looks like a cheese sculpture
of George Carlin left in the sun.

137
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,720
He had a show called "Jim'll Fix It"
where he granted wishes

138
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,360
and like many British kids,
I wrote to him.

139
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,840
I asked him to make me the mascot
for Liverpool Football Club.

140
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,360
Hd he never wrote back.
Which I'm glad about,

141
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,000
because after he died, Britain began
to find out who he really was

142
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,640
and the truth was horrific.

143
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,800
He's gone from a loved entertainer
and respected charity fundraiser

144
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,400
to a man described by Scotland Yard
as a predatory sex offender.

145
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,080
Jimmy Savile's headstone was here
for less than three weeks.

146
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,440
His epitaph read
"it was good while it lasted".

147
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,400
An unsettling thing to have written
on his gravestone.

148
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,840
Nearly every famous epitaph
would sound horrifying

149
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,200
written on a sex offender's gravestone,
from Dean Martin's

150
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,480
"everybody loves
somebody sometime",

151
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,720
to Rodney Dangerfield's
"there goes the neighborhood".

152
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Funny, but if he'd been
a sex offunder, not so much.

153
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,840
Savile's headstone was taken down.
As was that sign and that statue.

154
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,120
Once we found out
that he was a monster,

155
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,880
we accepted it was no longer
appropriate to publicly glorify him.

156
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,240
Which brings us to our main story
tonight: the Confederacy,

157
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,360
America's tracksuit sex offender.

158
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,880
There has been a robust debate over
Confederate symbols,

159
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,080
from flags being taken down,
to statues being removed,

160
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,360
to the white nationalist rallies
in Charlottesville,

161
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,680
the violent one in August
and the one happened last night.

162
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,280
As this debate is
not going away,

163
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,680
we wanted to take a look
at the arguments.

164
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,920
You don't have to look hard
to find people very upset

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,880
at the idea of Confederate statues
being taken away.

166
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,520
You can't change history,

167
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,240
you can't pick and choose
what you decide is history.

168
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,480
They oughta leave them alone.
They're part of history.

169
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,920
I don't think we can erase
our history.

170
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,600
It may not represent the best idea
that anybody ever came up with,

171
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,040
but it's part of our history
and I think it should stay there.

172
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,200
He is right that the Confederacy
and everything that came with it

173
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,840
is, to put it mildly, not the best
idea anybody ever came up with.

174
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,440
That is making grilled cheese
on a toaster turned sideways.

175
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,840
That is a billion-dollar idea
that is also worthless.

176
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,680
They're also right about one thing:
we should remember our history.

177
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,920
Let's do that and look at the unique
heritage of these symbols,

178
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,280
starting with the fact that there are
more than you expect.

179
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,200
The Southern Poverty Law Center

180
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,840
found 1 500 Confederate memorials
across the country.

181
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,040
More than 700 of them are statues
and monuments

182
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,880
and 10 U.S. military bases
are named for Confederate officers.

183
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,600
There are U.S. military bases named
for Confederate officers.

184
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,960
And they were the enemy !
They killed U.S. soldiers !

185
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,200
Like finding out that Nancy Kerrigan
named her child "Tonya Harding".

186
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,520
Why would you do that ?
That's a weird choice.

187
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,080
Tributes to the Confederacy are
everywhere, in the South,

188
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,280
and, notably,
some in the North, too.

189
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,760
That map doesn't include kitschy
ways the War is presented,

190
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,680
like at this family restaurant.

191
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:53,440
Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede brings
a rip-roaring taste of America to life !

192
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,880
Dixie Stampede is a musical
extravaganza of sight and sound

193
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,320
centered around a friendly
North/South rivalry.

194
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,200
Friendly servers bring
the delicious feast right to you,

195
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,720
including a whole rotisserie
chicken and all the Pepsi,

196
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,400
iced tea or coffee you like.

197
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,320
Yes: that is a Confederate soldier
serving a small child

198
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,680
all the Pepsi she likes,
which is still, remarkably,

199
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,040
only Pepsi's
second worst ad campaign.

200
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,240
If you grew up
with experiences like that,

201
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,440
it can seem like the Civil War
is just a friendly rivalry,

202
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,960
a fun, colorful part of U.S. history.

203
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,840
But that omits the key
fact about the Civil War:

204
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,600
the Confederacy was fighting
for the preservation of slavery.

205
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,320
And that's not my opinion.
That is just a fact.

206
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,440
There are many ways
that we know this.

207
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,840
Slavery is mentioned in
states' declarations of secession,

208
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,000
Mississippi saying:
"our position is identified"

209
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,120
"with the institution
of slavery".

210
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,280
Confederate constitution contains
a clause enshrining slavery forever.

211
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,640
The speech Stephens, the Confederate
vice president, gave in 1861,

212
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,760
in which he articulated the basic
principles for the Confederate nation.

213
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,560
Its foundations are laid,
its cornerstone rests upon the truth

214
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,080
that the negro
is not equal to the white man,

215
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,400
that slavery, subordination
to the superior race,

216
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,880
is his natural
and normal condition.

217
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,240
"Subordination
to the superior race"? That is explicit.

218
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,000
If the Confederacy
was not about slavery,

219
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,080
somebody should go back in time
and tell the fucking Confederacy that.

220
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,880
Many people think the Civil War
was over something else.

221
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,760
When people were asked

222
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,720
what do they think the main cause
of the Civil War is ?

223
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,840
48% said mainly
about states' rights,

224
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,240
only 38% said mainly about
slavery, 9% said both.

225
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,360
And that is amazing.

226
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,560
Only 38% thought the Civil War
was mainly about slavery.

227
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,560
In other words: look to your left.
Look to your right.

228
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,320
Statistically, all three of you
live in a country

229
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,800
where only 38% of people think
Civil War was mainly about slavery.

230
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,480
And on that "states' rights"
argument, for the record:

231
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,760
the Southern states were
ardently pro-states' rights,

232
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,200
but with some glaring exceptions.

233
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,680
When Northern states passed laws
to help protect runaway slaves,

234
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,640
the South wanted federal government
to override those states' laws.

235
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,320
So, they loved states' rights,
as they were the right states' rights.

236
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,200
The wrong states' rights
would be states' wrongs,

237
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,720
wrongs which needed to be righted
by the right states' rights.

238
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,800
To put it simply:
they just wanted to own black people

239
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,400
and they didn't much care how,
that's a fact !

240
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,160
But that's a very hard fact
for some people to accept,

241
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,880
especially if a member of your
family fought for the Confederacy.

242
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,160
The desire to want to distance
your relative from that cause

243
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,960
can lead to people distorting
the cause itself.

244
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,000
Watch as one man,
in North Carolina,

245
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,760
defend a Confederate statue
by talking about his family history.

246
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,320
My great-grandfather
was a Confederate soldier.

247
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,840
And I was proud of that

248
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:14,400
because my opinion
of his fight was for his rights.

249
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,080
I don't know what his rights
were, I wasn't there.

250
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,520
He was dead long
before I came along.

251
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,760
I'm concerned about our monument,
I want it to stay.

252
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,920
It reminds me that I got
a little rebel in me.

253
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,240
We all want
to kind of be independent.

254
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,720
We all have a little rebel in us,
even the ladies.

255
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,880
Even the ladies !

256
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,720
Hashtag feminism,
hashtag confedera-she.

257
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,880
I don't know
why his great-grandfather fought.

258
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,280
It is hard to know the motivations
of any individual soldier.

259
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,920
What we do know is that,
again, collectively,

260
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,320
they were fighting to preserve
the institution of slavery.

261
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,280
I honestly get wanting a more
comfortable history for your family,

262
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,440
but you can't invent a comfortable
history for your country.

263
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,240
You'd be erasing the actual,
painful experiences of many Americans,

264
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,600
as a fellow
North Carolinian explains.

265
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,800
When I walk by this statue,
I become very painful

266
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,640
when I think of the suffering
that my ancestors went through.

267
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,440
They enslaved people,

268
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,920
abused people
for their own economic impact

269
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,640
and it should not be celebrated
by these statues.

270
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,640
Right. And that is the harsh reality
of what was done by Confederate men,

271
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,160
and, yes, even the ladies,
hashtag confedera-she.

272
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,080
If you want to see a crystallization
of what happens when two people

273
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,240
have wildly different views
of the same symbol,

274
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,240
watch this local news clip.

275
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,080
- Why do you carry that flag ?
- Because this is my heritage !

276
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,480
My family fought to save
their farm under this flag !

277
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,120
Who was working that farm ?

278
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:13,800
That is a good, tough question.
The news clip cut out there,

279
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,600
but we were intrigued
to find out his response,

280
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,800
we tracked it down.

281
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,240
Whatever you are expecting,
you're going to be surprised.

282
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,800
- Who was working that farm ?
- My family was.

283
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,080
They were poor. Do you know
how much a slave cost back then ?

284
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,920
You know you are in the wrong
when you decide your best argument

285
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,920
is screaming at a black man: "You know
how expensive you used to be ?"

286
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,960
It is comments like that one
that landed this guy

287
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,760
on the cover of "Holy Shit That
Is Not Remotely The Point" magazine.

288
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,240
That is an intense example,

289
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,320
but denial of this painful part
of history can take many forms.

290
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,560
Look at PBS's
"Finding Your Roots",

291
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,280
where Henry Louis Gates explores
celebrities' family histories

292
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,000
and he often finds some shit.

293
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,320
Ben Affleck pulled strings to get
the show to remove all references

294
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,920
to his slave-owning ancestors
and though he later apologized,

295
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,440
that impulse is not good,
because it sanitizes history.

296
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,800
While there is no easy way to respond
to learning that horrible information,

297
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,280
it is worth watching Anderson Cooper
find out how one relative of his died.

298
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,800
Boykin was murdered
by a rebellious slave.

299
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,640
Your ancestor was beaten to death
with a farm hoe.

300
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,880
My god. That's amazing.

301
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,440
Incredible. I'm blown away.

302
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,160
- He deserved it ?
- Yeah.

303
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,280
You know what ?
As a general rule, just try

304
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,600
not to live a life that could lead
a descendant of yours to one day say:

305
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,720
"a guy smashed grandpappy's
head in with a garden hoe ?"

306
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,080
"Amazing !
Great job, that guy !"

307
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,120
But my absolute favorite response
to a nasty surprise

308
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,480
comes from Larry David,
who received a real one-two punch.

309
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,120
My great grandfather fought
for the South in the Civil War ?

310
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,120
Are you kidding ?

311
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,640
My goodness.
I hope no slaves show up on this.

312
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,520
Please turn the page.

313
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,200
Larry, this is another
part of the eighteenth...

314
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,960
You did it ! I knew it !

315
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,000
- Unbelievable.
- That's unbelievable.

316
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,520
Yeah, pret-ty, pret-ty, pretty bad.
Pretty bad !

317
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,480
Larry David is not responsible
for what his ancestors did.

318
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,960
None of us are. I have to believe
that, because I'm English

319
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,920
and I "would" like to go to an Indian
restaurant at some point in my life.

320
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,040
We do have to reckon,
personally and as a country,

321
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,800
with what our heritage means.

322
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,760
You can't ignore it,
like Batman.

323
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,240
You can't say it's something else,
like Town-Meeting Santa.

324
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,720
You've got to actively, painfully
come to grips with slavery

325
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,000
and the lasting benefits and
disadvantages it conferred,

326
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,760
in ways that we haven't yet.

327
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,440
That brings us back
to Confederate monuments.

328
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,000
There is something about them
that symbolizes our reluctance

329
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,640
to have that conversation and that
is the dates that they went up.

330
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,240
While some initial memorials were
built, mainly in cemeteries,

331
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,320
shortly after the Civil War,
the real surge came much later.

332
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,440
The Southern Poverty Law Center
says a majority of the monuments

333
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:49,280
were erected decades
after General Lee's surrender.

334
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,640
As this chart of the years
that they were dedicated shows,

335
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,440
there was a big spike
from 1900 to 1920,

336
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,960
as white southerners were reasserting
their dominance through Jim Crow laws,

337
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,640
with another spike
in the fifties and sixties,

338
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,400
as the Civil Rights Movement
was gaining steam.

339
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,600
So they weren't
commemorating recently-fallen dead,

340
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,320
as sending a hostile message
to African Americans.

341
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,240
Sending messages is kind
of what statues are often for.

342
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,720
This one says
"we love freedom".

343
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,120
This one: "the most notable thing about
our city is a fictional character",

344
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,600
and this one says
"about yea big".

345
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,680
We still don't know
what he was trying to measure,

346
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,440
but whatever it was,
it was about yea big.

347
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:43,720
For some Confederate statues,
the intent is crystal clear.

348
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,080
In that town meeting from before,
the statue they were debating was this,

349
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,760
which went up in 1914,

350
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,280
and a leader of that county's chapter
of the KKK gave a speech,

351
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,920
calling the occasion
an opportunity

352
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,880
"to recall achievements of the great
and good of our own race and blood".

353
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,080
Which is pretty
on-the-nose right there.

354
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,600
The largest Confederate memorial,
carving on Stone Mountain in Georgia,

355
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,560
is located where
the 20th-century KKK was born.

356
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,040
It depicts three Confederate
leaders on horseback

357
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,680
and it was completed in 1972,

358
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,920
so there is color footage
of the dedication.

359
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,400
After half a century of work,
the memorial carving is finished

360
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,880
and officials are calling it
the eighth wonder of the world.

361
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,720
We must recall those principles
of loyalty, dignity, and honor

362
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,160
that shine through the lives of men
we commemorate today.

363
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,560
Yes, that was Vice President
Spiro Agnew commemorating

364
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,040
the "loyalty" of literal traitors.

365
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,920
What can you expect from a man
whose name, rearranged,

366
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,480
spells "grow a penis" ?

367
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,120
Some monuments went up
even more recently.

368
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,440
I want to show you one that
was erected on private land,

369
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,640
but very much
for public consumption.

370
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,160
Once you see it,
you will not forget it.

371
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:12,040
The statue was erected in 1998.
It portrays Nathan Bedford Forrest

372
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,080
on his horse, gun in one hand
and sword in the other,

373
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,000
surrounded by Confederate
state battle flags,

374
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,600
visible for all to see
on the side of I-65.

375
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,920
Forrest was a Confederate general
and an early leader of the KKK.

376
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,920
That is terrifying,
regardless of context.

377
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,560
He looks like if a nickel
did cocaine.

378
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,680
Some of these statues commemorate
people who fought to preserve slavery,

379
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,200
were erected
to assert white supremacy

380
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,360
and were dedicated
by Klan members.

381
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,280
And yet, there is a blanket defense
that tends to get offered by people

382
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,400
and not just people,
also this guy.

383
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,960
They're trying to take away
our culture, our history.

384
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,360
Their argument is, taking these
statues down obliterates history.

385
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,800
Which is ridiculous. First: monuments
are not how we record history.

386
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:10,280
Books are. Museums are.
Ken Burns 12-part miniseries are.

387
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,960
Statues are how we glorify people
or, in the case of one in Tokyo,

388
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,440
how we glorify giant
radioactive lizards.

389
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,400
The president's concern: tearing down
statues leads to a slippery slope.

390
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,120
This week, it's Robert E. Lee.
Stonewall Jackson's coming down.

391
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,800
I wonder,
is it George Washington next week ?

392
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,040
Is it Thomas Jefferson
the week after ?

393
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,200
You really do have to ask yourself,
where does it stop ?

394
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,920
I'll tell you where it stops:
somewhere.

395
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,120
Anytime someone asks
"where does it stop ?"

396
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,480
the answer
is always fucking somewhere.

397
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,040
You might let your kid have Twizzlers,
but not inject black-tar heroin.

398
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,160
You don't go; "after the Twizzlers,
where does it stop ?"

399
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,760
And the same is true
of Confederate monuments.

400
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,520
Think of it this way:
all people, living and dead,

401
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,840
exist on what I'm going to call
the Hitler-Hanks spectrum,

402
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,120
from bad to good.

403
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,280
At some point
on the spectrum,

404
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,960
monuments to honor people
are going to be inappropriate.

405
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,920
It does get tricky
around the middle,

406
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,560
where, of course,
you'll find Adolf Hankler.

407
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:19,600
There are people deserving of statues
who were imperfect humans.

408
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,120
Sometimes our standards
change over time,

409
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,920
you're judging historical
figures by modern standards.

410
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,880
For many Confederate monuments,

411
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,880
especially those erected
well after the Civil War,

412
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,080
valorizing the cause
or leadership of the Confederacy,

413
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,960
this really isn't a close call.

414
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,680
This is your babysitter showing up
in a Jimmy Savile t-shirt.

415
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,440
I don't care what you think
that represents,

416
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,480
you're not staying home
with my fucking kid tonight.

417
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,760
For Robert E. Lee in particular,
it's easier, because of this.

418
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,960
Lee was once asked about placing
memorials at Gettysburg in 1869.

419
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,920
The former general replied:

420
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,040
"I think it wiser
not to keep open the sores of war"

421
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,560
"but to follow those
nations who endeavored to obliterate"

422
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,320
"the marks of civil strife,"

423
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,200
"to commit to oblivion
the feelings engendered."

424
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,040
Robert E. Lee was opposed to statues
of people like Robert E. Lee.

425
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,280
So any city that decides to keep
a statue of him should

426
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,440
add a speech bubble saying:
"I told you not to do this".

427
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,040
What do we do now ? I would argue
that "nothing" is not acceptable.

428
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,320
Trying to paper over the cracks
can make things worse.

429
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,800
Richmond tried to fix
its Monument Avenue,

430
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,800
a street lined with statues
of Confederate leaders,

431
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,320
by adding African-American
tennis legend Arthur Ashe to it.

432
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,760
You can't give Confederates
a black friend and say:

433
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,440
"We're good, right ?"
Arthur's up there. You love Arthur."

434
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,880
If we want to learn from
and honor our history,

435
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,680
the first step might be to put statues
somewhere more appropriate,

436
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,200
surrounded by ample historical
context, like in a museum,

437
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,280
where people go to learn
about history

438
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,520
and also,
to punish their children.

439
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,880
Try not to think of this as a loss.
It's actually a real opportunity.

440
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I'll show you,
please come with me:

441
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,080
if and when a plinth
becomes empty,

442
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,360
that is a huge chance for your area,
to honor someone who deserves it.

443
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,160
I have some ideas for replacements
I would love to run by you.

444
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,840
First: Beaufort County,
South Carolina,

445
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:35,280
how about a giant statue
of Robert Smalls here ?

446
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,400
He was born into slavery,
he stole a Confederate boat

447
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,000
and he sailed it to freedom,
later served five terms in Congress.

448
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,440
This guy is amazing !
Atlanta, Texas ?

449
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,600
You are the birthplace
to Bessie Coleman,

450
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,080
the first African American
woman pilot.

451
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,400
Why would you not want this ?
She's incredible !

452
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,160
Florida ?
You might not want an individual,

453
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,760
but something that honors
what your state represents ?

454
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,920
Something that says
"you've got a little rebel in you" ?

455
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,720
I give you this statue
of your official state reptile,

456
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,920
an alligator,
giving everyone the finger.

457
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,520
He's called Herman !
And he definitely says Florida,

458
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,240
while also having
nothing to do with slavery !

459
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,760
Finally there is Charleston.
And to you I say this:

460
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,840
why have a divisive Confederate
statue when instead,

461
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,000
that pedestal can be filled
by your favorite son,

462
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,840
the actual Stephen Colbert,
who will stand up there all day,

463
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,800
telling you fun facts
about your wonderful town ?

464
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,880
Right ?

465
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,360
Yes, Charleston.

466
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:46,160
Charleston is the site of the
first free public library in America !

467
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,800
That's fascinating !

468
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,400
Every year,
we host Zugunruhefest,

469
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,720
the Southeast's most comprehensive
migration-focused birding festival !

470
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,080
That sounds incredible !
I'll Google it !

471
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,440
You can have this 24 hours
a day, seven days a week !

472
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,840
I actually, I need to do
my show five days a week.

473
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,720
Five ?! How ?

474
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,960
I don't know.

475
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,560
We're also Traveler and Leisure's
number 1 U.S. destination

476
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,360
for the last 5 years running !

477
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,400
Come on, Charleston !
You could have this in your life !

478
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,520
That's our show.
See you next week, good night !

479
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,680
Also, it's the first public
museum in America.

480
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,280
It's also the first naval victory
over the British in America !

481
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,560
- I don't want to hear that.
- Of course you don't.

482
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,120
It's kind of important.
We're proud of it.

483
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,040
- You started it.
- No, no you started it. Be honest.

484
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,880
We started it a little bit...

485
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,800
END OF EPISODE 26,
SEASON IV
