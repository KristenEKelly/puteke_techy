00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,840
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,200
Season IV
Episode 24

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,680
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,760
Thank you for joining us.
Another frantic week.

5
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,120
A new and terrible health care bill
was pushed in the Senate,

6
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,280
the president called Kim Jong Un
"Rocket Man" at the UN,

7
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,880
there were developments in
Mueller's Russia investigation

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,280
and this weekend,
all hell broke loose.

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,200
The president picking
a fight with professional athletes.

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,760
Taking aim at players
like Colin Kaepernick

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,880
who protested by taking a knee
during the national anthem.

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,840
Wouldn't you love to see
one of these NFL owners,

13
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,200
when somebody
disrespects our flag, to say:

14
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,600
get that son of a bitch off the field,
he's fired !

15
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,360
Putting aside the free-speech
implications there,

16
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,320
how is kneeling in front
of a flag more disrespectful to it

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,320
than grinding it against
your gnarled, old boner ?

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,160
I'm afraid it is true: the president
of the US took time out

19
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,440
while three million American citizens
in Puerto Rico are without power

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,240
to call Colin Kaepernick
a son of a bitch.

21
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,040
Kaepernick's own mother
magnificently responding:

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,440
"guess that makes me
a proud bitch !"

23
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,440
That was one of many eye-catching
responses to Trump,

24
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,520
including Bills running back
LeSean McCoy tweeting:

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,800
"it's really sad, man, dot dot dot,
our president is an asshole".

26
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,000
Many more players took a knee

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,200
and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell
denounced the president's comments.

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,560
When you have lost the moral
high ground to Roger Goodell,

29
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,960
something is horribly wrong.

30
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,600
Which is not to say that Trump did not
have his supporters,

31
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,960
and none were more vigorous
than Fox News's Jeanine Pirro,

32
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,280
who delivered a calm and measured
address to those kneeling players.

33
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,360
America's been incredibly good
to every one of you

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,920
from the time you displayed
talent in sports as a youth,

35
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,880
America's allowed you to shine
and become financially prosperous.

36
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,880
There are so many of you who make
tens of millions of dollars.

37
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,880
Shame on you.
Shame on all of you.

38
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,960
No one wants to hear about politics
from a wildly successful athlete.

39
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,920
You only want to hear about them
from an abject failure of a prosecutor

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,040
who somehow let Robert Durst
slip through her fingers.

41
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,960
Jeanine, there's a flag behind you,
have some fucking respect.

42
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,520
Let's move on, because I would like
to focus on a pair of scandals

43
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,240
concerning officials
and their use of planes.

44
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,720
Tom Price had taken at least
two dozen private-plane trips

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,760
since he became health secretary,

46
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,960
which by one estimate has cost
taxpayers more than $400 000.

47
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,000
An occasional private jet flight
may be necessary for officials.

48
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,480
But for many of these flights,
including one to Philadelphia,

49
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,760
it turns out far less costly
alternatives were available

50
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,040
as CNN's graphics department
showed.

51
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,080
There was a commercial flight
departing just minutes earlier.

52
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,640
That commercial flight would have
cost between $500 and $700.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,360
There was also the option of Amtrak.
A train from DC to Philadelphia,

54
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,520
even in first class, would've cost
no more than a few hundred dollars.

55
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,200
The same trip by car would've cost
an estimated $18 in gasoline

56
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,040
each way for an SUV.

57
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,920
Price could've taken a Greyhound bus
for either 10 dollars or a hand-job.

58
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,960
Or he could've just Razor scootered
himself there instead.

59
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,080
Or even fired himself out of a cannon
and saved us all a lot of money.

60
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,360
According to Politico, he may've
paid $25 000 for that trip,

61
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,800
which is disgraceful.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,560
Not as disgraceful as this
mustache he used to have.

63
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,560
But still, unforgiveable. It's like
his upper lip is being haunted

64
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,400
by the mustache of a
17th-century sex offender.

65
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,400
But for sheer brazenness here,
Price has to take a reclinable backseat

66
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,120
to treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin,
a man whose appearance answer to:

67
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,400
"what if income inequality dressed up
as me, John Oliver, for Halloween ?"

68
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,840
That's mean, to both of us...
Mnuchin's wife, Louise Linton,

69
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,880
seen here on her wedding day,
silently reminding herself,

70
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,480
that this is exactly what she wanted,

71
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,480
stepped in trouble when accompanied
her husband on a trip to Kentucky.

72
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,480
It all started when Louise Linton
posted a picture of herself

73
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,840
getting off a government plane,
mentioning labels from her outfit,

74
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,040
including Hermes and Tom Ford.

75
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,040
An Oregon woman responded:

76
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,160
"glad we could pay
your little get away. #deplorable."

77
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,440
Linton fired back: "pretty sure
the amount we sacrifice per year"

78
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,080
"is more than you'd be willing
to sacrifice"

79
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,680
and "you're adorably out of touch."

80
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,800
It's a little ironic that Linton,
who actually tagged her photo

81
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,120
"hashtag ValentinoRockstudHeels",
is calling someone else out of touch.

82
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,160
Rockstud heels ? Really, Louise ?

83
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,760
What is this, Valentino's Fall 2010
ready to-wear show ?

84
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,360
Is there some asymmetrical pastel
organza you'd like to pair them with ?

85
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,000
Maybe something floaty
with a scalloped hem ?

86
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,800
Or is it seven years ago only
from the ankle-down ?

87
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,720
If you've never seen Valentino
rockstud heels, first: congratulations,

88
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,520
Google-image: "a stylist phones it in
for a CW star's red carpet appearance"

89
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,720
"at the People's Choice Awards"
and you will find them.

90
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,320
The strangest part of Linton's
response came when she wrote:

91
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,200
"do you think the US govt paid for
our honeymoon or personal travel ?"

92
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,480
I hadn't considered that, but now that
you've brought it up: yes, definitely.

93
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,480
Guess what we found out last week ?

94
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,840
Multimillionaire treasury
secretary Steven Mnuchin requested

95
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,160
that he and his new wife, Louise,
regularly seen in designer clothes

96
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,120
with purses at $10 000 plus,
be allowed to travel in style

97
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,360
in a government jet
on their honeymoon to Europe.

98
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:03,640
A man worth an estimated $300 million
asked to use a government jet.

99
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,840
And the request was later
withdrawn, which is good,

100
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,120
because that would've been
a breathtaking waste of money.

101
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,360
That is saying something for Mnuchin

102
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,400
considering that
he invested in Collateral Beauty.

103
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,200
A movie that was, and not a lot
of people know this, a movie.

104
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,480
Mnuchin is still facing questions over
whether he arranged that trip,

105
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,440
it happened to be the perfect spot
from which to view the solar eclipse.

106
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,680
Mnuchin denied that, and, casually
insulted the entire state of Kentucky.

107
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,480
People in Kentucky took
this stuff very seriously.

108
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,080
Being a New Yorker, in California,
I was like,

109
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,040
I don't have any interest
in watching the eclipse.

110
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,840
What are you talking about ?

111
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,520
It's a fucking eclipse,
not a Broadway show.

112
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,120
I live in Manhattan so
I see eclipses all the time.

113
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,480
I'll leave work a little early, grab
a pre-eclipse dinner at Joe Allen.

114
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,640
I don't have time to go to Kentucky
to see some touring-company eclipse.

115
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,920
I know Mnuchin and Price's scandals
are not the biggest in the world.

116
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,280
For this administration,
they're nostalgically quaint.

117
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,880
But to quote America's
loudest legal mind,

118
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,840
America has been
incredibly good to them.

119
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,760
It's allowed them to shine, and
become financially prosperous

120
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,800
and they've made million dollars.

121
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,200
They have disgraced the American
taxpayer. So shame on you.

122
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,080
Shame on both of you.

123
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,800
And now this.

124
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,720
A preview of Megyn Kelly's
new morning show.

125
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,160
In a world, in a country that
is incredibly divided right now,

126
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,000
my hope is that this show
can be a unifying force.

127
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,440
And now look at the "unifying force"
that is Megyn Kelly.

128
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,320
Gay rights are more protected
and recognized in this country.

129
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,120
Christian beliefs and rights,
not so much.

130
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,280
This is about the attempted war
on the religious right, not on women.

131
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,560
For all you kids watching at home,
Santa just is white.

132
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,680
Jesus was a white man.

133
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,320
The decision to drop the now-infamous
voter intimidation case

134
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,080
against members
of the New Black Panther Party.

135
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,240
The New Black Panther case.
The New Black Panther Party,

136
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,560
out there saying we gotta go
kill some cracker babies.

137
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,440
Do you hate white people ?
Is Obama playing the race card ?

138
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,880
Now people made this a race thing.
Do black lives matter, or all lives ?

139
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,360
Last night's debate
found five presidential contenders

140
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,720
suggesting black lives may have
more value than all lives.

141
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,040
Are these just thugs ?
Thugs is not far off the mark.

142
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,280
The thug mentality,
and that's a controversial term,

143
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,080
that it's cool to sort of hate
the cops and hang out

144
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,120
and be somebody who doesn't
prize being there for your family.

145
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,440
Illegals. Late-term abortions.
Death panels. War on Christmas.

146
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,560
Benghazi. Look at that moron.
Cupcake nation alert !

147
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,880
A culture of victimization.
If you watch those VMAs,

148
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,800
you wonder if in 25 years they're
gonna be openly having sex on stage.

149
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:17,440
Why can't we acknowledge the role God
played in formation of this country ?

150
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,080
You get on TV every night
and state what you believe to be true.

151
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,080
- I do. I state what I believe...
- You're opinion guy. I'm journalist.

152
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,120
Moving on. Tonight, I would like
to talk to you about business:

153
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,280
the thing that everyone on "Shark Tank"
thinks they have a great idea for,

154
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,400
even this guy !

155
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,640
Our cakes are made of foam
and they're rentals.

156
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,320
Wait: so I can neither have
my cake nor eat it, too ? I am in.

157
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,120
Here is a million dollars.

158
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,080
Small startup businesses like that hold
a special place in America's heart

159
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,120
and politicians love to talk
about how important they are.

160
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,680
Small business is the backbone
of the American economy.

161
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,200
Small businesses are the backbone
of this nation's economy.

162
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:12,520
Small businesses are
the backbone of our economy.

163
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,080
Small businesses are
the backbones of our economy.

164
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,920
It's true. "Small businesses
are the backbone of our economy"

165
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,920
is that rare thing that
every politician agrees on.

166
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,680
It's that, "support the troops",
"Ted Cruz can go fuck himself"

167
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,440
and South Dakota senator John Thune
can get it, he can get it.

168
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,040
It can feel like we're in a golden age
of small business startups,

169
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,800
but the rate at which new businesses
are created been falling since 1970.

170
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:48,600
And one of the reasons is that big
businesses have been getting bigger.

171
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,320
Which brings us to our main topic:
corporate consolidation.

172
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,400
Recent years have seen record highs
for mergers and acquisitions,

173
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,760
as you would know if you've watched
reactions they get on business news.

174
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,320
M&A has been hot,
continues to be hot.

175
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,240
An exciting year for M&A.

176
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,520
A few blockbuster deals. They call
it Merger Monday on Wall Street.

177
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,240
It is shaping up to be another
Merger Monday.

178
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,680
Don't call it Merger Monday
for nothing.

179
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,080
Media Mega Merger Monday...

180
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,400
Merger Monday ?!?
At last we have one. And I sayý

181
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,600
That is a little nauseating.

182
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,440
But also pressing a button on TV
is a little bit dangerous.

183
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,240
Someone could take that footage
and then loop any sound they want.

184
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,360
I am not immature enough to do that.
If I were, it would look like this.

185
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,960
Merger Monday ?!?
At last we have one. And I say...

186
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,000
The point is all this merger activity

187
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,880
helped make some sectors of our
economy ridiculously consolidated.

188
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,680
The US has gone from having 10 large
airlines back in 2000 to just 4 today.

189
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,640
And those 4 mega airlines
now dominate

190
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,040
more than
80% of the US market.

191
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,360
We're down
to just four major airline choices.

192
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,280
That does not include Jet Blue,
that is not actually an airline.

193
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,640
It's just an expensive way to eat
those weird blue chips,

194
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,040
which are, and this is true,
just sliced Grover arms.

195
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,520
Airlines are just the beginning.
The rental car business

196
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,560
is now 90 percent dominated
by just three companies.

197
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,840
The US beer industry is 70 percent
controlled by just two companies.

198
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,720
And online search
engines are, as we all know,

199
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,680
dominated by one major player.

200
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,320
That's right, say it with me: Bing.

201
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,360
That's right, Bing:
the best way to Google something.

202
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,640
Even our own parent company,
Time Warner,

203
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,000
is currently trying
to merge with AT&T,

204
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,400
which makes this story
dangerous for us to do.

205
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,240
Presuming that AT&T's
executives manage to get

206
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,200
their shitty service
working long enough to see it.

207
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:15,480
AT&T: it's the top telecom company
around, alphabetically, nothing else.

208
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:21,560
Even brands you might think of as indie
now have multinational owners.

209
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,960
Burt's Bees ? It's not run by
a backwoods bee-fucker called Burt,

210
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,200
it's run by Clorox.

211
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,240
Tom's of Maine, the deodorant
which didn't deodorize your roommate ?

212
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,520
That's now owned
by Colgate-Palmolive.

213
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,480
And then there is Goose Island.
Now their ads

214
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,640
feature beardy brewers
rubbing hops on their faces.

215
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,280
They don't mention Goose Island
is owned by Anheuser-Busch

216
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,000
and that farm that you just saw
is located at 822 Budweiser Loop.

217
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,080
It's presumably just past
Bud Light Lime-A-Rita Boulevard.

218
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,280
If you see the mass grave of Clydesdale
horses, turn left and you're there.

219
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,680
It says something about the rapid rate
of mergers that even Jim Cramer

220
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,080
occasionally finds himself in disbelief
at one happening.

221
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,640
Watch him react to a mega-merger
in the aluminum can industry.

222
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,560
Ball Corp's acquisition of Rexxam

223
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,920
is taking the number of competitors
in this space down from 3 to 2.

224
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,840
How did they let that happen ?

225
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:31,080
It's not great when a business-casual
Louis C.K. with a sound effects board

226
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,840
is saying: "Holy shit,
this was a really bad idea."

227
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,400
But "how did they let that happen ?"
is a really good question

228
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,240
and the answer is interesting.

229
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,800
We have had antitrust laws on the books
for more than a century.

230
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,880
I'm not saying that
every single merger is bad.

231
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:52,520
Businesses getting bigger can lead to
greater efficiencies and improvements.

232
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,000
The tension is between allowing that
and preventing them from doing harm.

233
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,160
So it's a balance. But since
the late 1970s,

234
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,280
that balance has tipped in
favor of being merger-friendly.

235
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,640
Which led to problems.
Let's start with the obvious:

236
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,520
for workers, mergers
can often mean big layoffs.

237
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,280
It's not just employees
that can suffer, consumers can, too,

238
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,480
as Jim Cramer explained,
in that aluminum-can segment

239
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,160
in an inexplicably sarcastic tone.

240
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,000
I always say competition,
while great for you a consumer,

241
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,600
is anathema to profits.

242
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,920
Sometimes a business will be a total
monopoly with no competition.

243
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,200
While that's the ideal,
it's rare to see a genuine monopoly

244
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,000
because it's against the law.

245
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,000
Which brings us
to the next best thing: an oligopoly,

246
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,240
where a handful of companies
control an entire industry,

247
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,640
coexisting without much
in the way of price competition.

248
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,760
That's a weird tone to use to describe
something that's awful.

249
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,120
"It's rare to see genuine bestiality,
because it's against the law,"

250
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,560
"which brings us
to the next best thing:"

251
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:01,200
"having sex with a stuffed animal while
looking at pictures of a real horse."

252
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,720
For a sense of what it can look like
when "a handful of companies coexist"

253
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,440
"without much in the way of
price competition," look at airlines.

254
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,960
In 2012, one airline executive told
an industry conference,

255
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,640
consolidation allowed us to do things
like ancillary revenues,

256
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,360
which is jargon for all those fees
that drive you crazy.

257
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,560
American was the first major airline
to charge you

258
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,880
for your first checked bag,
back in 2008.

259
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,400
And back then,
people could not believe it.

260
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,040
American Airlines will soon charge
15 dollars for the first checked bag.

261
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,640
That's on top of a fee
of $25 for your second one.

262
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,400
Fifteen dollars ? I'll have
to put my underwear in my pockets !

263
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,880
Yes. First: that is clearly
a delightful man.

264
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,720
It does make you wonder whether
he fills his bags full of underwear

265
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,960
and nothing else.

266
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,320
But within months, most major
airlines followed American's lead

267
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,520
and it was the industry standard.

268
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,360
And it is easy for that to happen

269
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,840
when there's only
a handful of big players.

270
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,800
Since then, they've increased
bag fees multiple times,

271
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,240
which is how those fees have gone
from generating

272
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,880
around $540 million a year a decade
ago, to $4.2 billion now.

273
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,040
If I wanted exorbitant fees
that keep getting raised all the time

274
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,880
despite shitty service,
I'd become a customer of AT&T.

275
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,160
Fuck you, AT&T. Even if you take over,
you'll never be my real dad !

276
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,960
You may well be angry with the service
you get from airlines,

277
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,160
but thanks to consolidation,
they don't really need to give a shit.

278
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,520
Remember that awful video
that went around earlier this year ?

279
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,600
The shocking images of a passenger
caught in a travel nightmare.

280
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,240
A man shaken as he's yanked
and then dragged off a United jet

281
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,160
by law enforcement after
refusing to give up his seat.

282
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,320
That is the most horrifying thing
you can see on an airplane,

283
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,080
unless your in-flight movie
is "The Boss Baby".

284
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,240
A movie that combines the
unbearable smugness of Alec Baldwin

285
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,520
with the unbearable smugness
of a baby.

286
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,840
People said it was a PR nightmare,
there was talk of boycotting United.

287
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,840
On certain routes,
they're the only option.

288
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,840
So a boycott is going to be
pretty hard to pull off.

289
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,720
That is why their CEO was able to open
his earnings call for that quarter,

290
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,640
by describing a period in which

291
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,200
a passenger had his teeth knocked out
on one of United's planes, like this.

292
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,600
Welcome to a terrific second quarter,
strong financial results

293
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,640
and even more
incredible operational results...

294
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,000
As you think of our customers, I thank
them for their loyalty and support.

295
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,480
We continue to find
new and better ways to service them

296
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,120
and make them more comfortable
on our airline.

297
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,320
Is it really any wonder that
their earnings stayed solid ?

298
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,920
United is sometimes the only way
to get to where you are going,

299
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,920
which explains their new slogan:

300
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,200
"You want to rollerblade
to Houston ? Shut up and get in."

301
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,280
And when an industry
gets too consolidated,

302
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,120
any company trying to compete
or survive in their supply chain

303
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,480
can get crushed.

304
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,680
Now we all know about
Amazon, Walmart, or Google,

305
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,080
but there are less obvious examples,
take eyewear.

306
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,720
If you go into a LensCrafters,
you will see frames from brands

307
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,160
like Prada, Dolce and Gabbana,
Burberry and Ralph Lauren,

308
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,040
all of which are made by
an Italian company called Luxottica.

309
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,120
Which, incidentally,
also own LensCrafters

310
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,560
and Sunglass Hut, and Pearle Vision
and runs Target Optical

311
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,000
and Sears Optical.

312
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:01,040
What happens when a smaller company
goes up against them ? Ask Oakley.

313
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,440
Oakley was a big competitor.
They had a fight with Luxottica.

314
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,480
Luxottica basically said: "We're
dropping you from our stores."

315
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,600
They refused to sell
their glasses in their stores.

316
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,520
They dropped Oakley,
Oakley's stock price collapsed.

317
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,800
There were some issues in
the beginning of the 2000s.

318
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,120
Both understood
that it was better to go along.

319
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,480
- We merged with Oakley in 2007.
- You bought Oakley.

320
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,520
They tried to compete and they lost
and then you bought them.

321
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,360
I understand your theory, but they
understood life was better together.

322
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,720
That is the menacing tone
of a Bond villain.

323
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,000
They understood life
was better together. Mr. Bond, no ?

324
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,760
That is the first time
that I've ever felt sorry for Oakley,

325
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,080
the official sunglasses of guys
who use the term: "fingerblasting".

326
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,080
It's a sponsorship deal. There is
one more victim of consolidation

327
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,320
and that is
the products themselves.

328
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,680
Heavily consolidated industries can
lose the incentive to innovate.

329
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,640
And the best example of this may be
the cable box beneath your TV.

330
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,600
If you have one of those,
you probably hate it.

331
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:24,080
It's huge, glitchy, and one of
the largest energy-consuming items,

332
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,840
even when it's turned off.

333
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,800
Cable companies have no real
incentive to improve them,

334
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,160
they're regional monopolies.

335
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,760
They know that you basically
have nowhere else to go.

336
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,480
You can't even smash your cable
box of frustration, you are renting it

337
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,720
and they'll then charge you
if you don't give it back.

338
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,360
We went to the trouble
of blowing this one up for you.

339
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,480
Please take a look. There you go.
Pretty cathartic to watch, right ?

340
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,200
Feel free to watch it again
in slow-motion.

341
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,640
I want you to know:
that box suffered.

342
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:21,000
We seem to have forgotten
how important antitrust is

343
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,240
and now all being forced to live
with the consequences.

344
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,440
This issue affects almost everything
you do. Angry at banks ?

345
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,320
The industry is dominated
by just these four.

346
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,240
Frustrated with your
health insurance provider ?

347
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,720
Odds are, it's one of these.
If this story is infuriating you

348
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,640
that you are yearning
for the sweet escape of death,

349
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,120
bad luck because the casket industry
is controlled by these companies.

350
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,880
The afterlife is actually
controlled by "one" religion.

351
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,360
I'm not saying which one, but when
you find out, you are gonna be so mad !

352
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,640
The point is we have laws to prevent
the worst effects of consolidation.

353
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,680
And it may well be time to more
aggressively use them,

354
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,760
to empower the FTC and the DOJ's
antitrust divisions.

355
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,000
That is something most people
would really get behind,

356
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,240
and nearly every politician should.

357
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,440
After all, there is one thing
they cannot stop saying.

358
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,760
Small business
is the backbone of our economy.

359
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,280
If they really believe that,
it may be time for them

360
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,920
to stop talking about backbones
and actually fucking grow one.

361
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,160
And now this.

362
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:39,120
All of Jim Cramer's sound buttons,
replaced with fart noises.

363
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,160
Hedge funds that are
in trouble start selling.

364
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,520
Not because they want to, but
because they have to raise money

365
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,120
to pay back their
unhappy clients.

366
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,760
Things keep working out.

367
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,880
Is it any wonder that Norfolk Southern
Union Pacific keep running ?

368
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,880
Buy high, and then sell low.

369
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,640
A time honored way to lose money.

370
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,440
Sell it tomorrow.

371
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,560
The whole idea of saving
for retirement will put you to sleep.

372
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,720
Well I want you feel emboldened
not...

373
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,520
As we tell you what we would do
before we pull any trigger.

374
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,240
I was wrong on both counts.

375
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:36,440
Moving on. Finally tonight, just
a quick word regarding trains.

376
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,600
Basically, buses that fuck.

377
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,600
We recently became obsessed
with WNEP Scranton's train.

378
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,080
It runs behind their
weather forecasts,

379
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,520
we got so obsessed
that on our last program,

380
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,360
we made them a large train set
and ended our show with this plea.

381
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,520
WNEP, call us to arrange
pickup or delivery

382
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,200
of the greatest backyard train
that local news has ever seen.

383
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,640
We built them
an enormous train set

384
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,160
and then demanded that they drive
two and a half hours to get it.

385
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,640
Which is basically
the world's worst gift,

386
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,880
right after giving
someone a "plant".

387
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,320
That is not a present.
It is an assignment.

388
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:24,120
In classic Scranton style, viewers
were split on the issue of the train,

389
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,360
some, like this one,
were positive.

390
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,520
You've got to go get that train,
that beautiful train for the backyard

391
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,640
that HBO made.

392
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,320
Your little one,
I can't even look at it now.

393
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,960
Come on ! There's no need
to make this about how shitty,

394
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,440
your words,
the regular backyard train is.

395
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,080
To be fair: not everyone
in Scranton liked ours, either.

396
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:55,360
I won't let some New York big shot
come and give that big, fancy train.

397
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,240
The hecks with them
New York fellows there.

398
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,640
What do they know about
trains anyway ?

399
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,760
That man does have a point.
The subway here proves

400
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,280
that New Yorkers
know nothing about trains.

401
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,920
Subway trains are basically
just elongated dumpsters with seats

402
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,200
that slowly roll through
rat-infested sadness tunnels.

403
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,920
Those angry callers got their wish,

404
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:22,000
our train set will not be replacing
their backyard train,

405
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,720
for the simple reason
that it doesn't fit in their backyard.

406
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,320
Which, to be completely honest,
we kind of thought might be the case.

407
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:35,920
We decided it would be funnier
to give them a really big train.

408
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,360
It wasn't an accident.
We're just terrible people.

409
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,440
But the really good news here is
that WNEP donated our train set

410
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,440
to Scranton's local
Electric City Trolley Museum.

411
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,520
Or as it's known to the children
"every fucking year's class trip".

412
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:56,000
They went all-out, even using
a police escort

413
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,520
to bring our train set
through Scranton.

414
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,240
Took a train, loaded it into a truck
and then surrounded it with cars.

415
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,880
So they weren't so much "going"
to a transportation museum

416
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,120
as "becoming" one.

417
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,160
And on Friday,
they celebrated the big unveiling.

418
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,000
Now that large train is on display
in Scranton for all to see.

419
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,040
John Oliver could not make
it to today's dedication,

420
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,960
but we were honored with the presence
of two of the show's characters:

421
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,720
Mr. Nutterbutter himself
and the Dancing Zebra

422
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,960
took part in today's festivities.

423
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,960
I couldn't make it,

424
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,920
I have to work all week to make
this show... Stephen and Jimmy.

425
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,760
We did send our favorite naturally
occurring barcode, the Bolivian Zebra.

426
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,240
And Mr. Nutterbutter,
America's furriest co-defendant.

427
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,280
This train adventure
has genuinely been a lot of fun

428
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,040
and I would like to thank
the people of Scranton,

429
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,320
because they found the perfect way
to say thank you,

430
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,440
and also to get back at me.

431
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,160
We have made some amendments
to it since you saw it last here.

432
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,960
John Oliver's face is now on it.

433
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,840
Well played, Scranton ! There is
no more passive aggressive way

434
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:19,040
to thank someone for a gift than by
driving a train into their face.

435
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,240
That is our show, we'll see you
next week, good night !

436
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,560
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

437
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,760
END OF EPISODE 24,
SEASON IV
