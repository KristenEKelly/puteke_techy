00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,080
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,640
Season IV
episode 8

3
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,320
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,160
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,200
A quick recap of the week.
It has been frantically busy.

6
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,600
Senate triggered the nuclear option
to put Gorsuch onto the Supreme Court

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,440
and, therefore,
a lobster onto our all-dog court.

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,800
Nunes recused himself from house
investigation of Trump's Russia ties

9
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,480
after he came
under an ethics investigation.

10
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,480
A classic Devin move.

11
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,920
On Thursday,
there was the biggest news of all.

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,040
President Trump has just
ordered a military strike on Syria.

13
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,480
U.S. warships launched between 50
and 60 Tomahawk cruise missiles

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,800
targeting a Syrian government
air base.

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,680
A Syrian airfield this week
was bombed by President Trump,

16
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,520
two words that when placed
in a sentence like that

17
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,640
are as downright unsettling as
ham smoothie or placenta kimono.

18
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,840
Before we get into
what we did and why,

19
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,960
it is worth to acknowledge reactions
to the airstrikes themselves,

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,120
particularly within the media,
which bordered on the orgasmic.

21
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,800
We see these beautiful pictures
at night

22
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,400
from the decks of these two U.S. Navy
vessels in the eastern Mediterranean.

23
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,840
I am tempted to quote
the great Leonard Cohen:

24
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,400
"I'm guided by the beauty
of our weapons."

25
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,760
They are beautiful pictures
of fearsome armaments.

26
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,000
What are you talking about ?

27
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,080
It is a little ironic to see
Brian Williams on MSNBC

28
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,560
talking about
"the beauty of our weapons",

29
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,040
that is not a phrase anyone
would use if they had, for instance,

30
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,120
ever been in a helicopter
that was hit by ground fire.

31
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,600
He wasn't done talking about
whatever the fuck he was talking about.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,840
Because life imitates art, there's
a scene in "The American President"

33
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,240
where Michael Douglas,
playing the fictional president,

34
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,040
is being told that an airstrike
against a radar installation

35
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,880
is proportional
and it's presidential.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,080
He chooses to think about the guy
who's coming on the night shift

37
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,680
as part of a cleaning crew

38
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,600
and how he's gonna lose his life
in this presidential airstrike.

39
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,760
The same
thing happened tonight.

40
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,080
No, it didn't. Because first, this is
not a song, it's not a movie,

41
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,760
we fired real missiles
at an actual country.

42
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,960
There is nothing obvious about
Trump's concern for another human.

43
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,280
The only time he's thought about
a cleaning crew has been to say:

44
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,000
"There's a fingerprint on this vase.
Don't pay them this week."

45
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,400
Some of Trump's biggest critics
had praise for the strikes,

46
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,800
John McCain and Lindsey Graham
saying Trump deserves the support

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and Chuck Schumer saying
it was the right thing to do.

48
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,040
Some of Trump's prominent supporters
were significantly less happy,

49
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,040
including Alex Jones, who tried
to weave a conspiracy around it.

50
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,200
So paradoxically,
Trump is really disintegrating

51
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,640
in my eyes on many levels.

52
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,720
Paradoxically
he's doing so much good,

53
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,640
I realize they're maneuvering him,
so they won't call him a Russian agent,

54
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,480
so he can look tough
to the Russians and to the Chinese.

55
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,640
So he can shut down his critics.

56
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,880
But once you feed the pirate,
they're going to want more.

57
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,800
"Once you feed the pirate
they're going to want more ?"

58
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,560
Not only is all of that crazy,
that is not even a phrase.

59
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,960
I'm against these strikes,
you know what they say:

60
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,960
if you wanna skin a ferret,
bring your dancin' shoes.

61
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,960
And I mean it ! Once you start
washing an alligator,

62
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,720
paradoxically,
you don't stop 'til it's dry.

63
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,680
There are serious questions
regarding these airstrikes,

64
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,320
in retaliation against al-Assad's
apparent use of chemical weapons

65
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,640
to target his own people,
which is horrific.

66
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,760
When Assad did
the same thing four years ago,

67
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,520
Trump's response
was significantly different.

68
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,080
The attack also a startling about-face
for President Trump,

69
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,080
who has repeatedly argued against
military intervention in Syria.

70
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,560
Why do we care ?
Let ISIS and Syria fight.

71
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,080
And let Russia, they're in Syria,
let them fight ISIS.

72
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,920
Tweeting after the last major chemical
attack in Syria four years ago

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,840
that the US should stay
out of the conflict.

74
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,800
Is there anything Trump is doing now

75
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,240
where he didn't at one point
tweet about doing the opposite ?

76
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,560
I honestly would not be surprised
if in 2011, he tweeted:

77
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,680
"only an idiot would live in a big
white house and sign bills into law."

78
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,840
Hashtag sad.

79
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,560
Administration officials said
that it was the gruesome images

80
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,280
that changed Trump's mind.

81
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,840
Which, on one level,
is understandable.

82
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,920
The images were horrifying.
Just as they were four years ago.

83
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,480
It's natural to want to take
some kind of action in response,

84
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,320
it has to come
in the context of a larger strategy,

85
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,000
or it's close to worthless.

86
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,440
Though the strikes
made certain people feel better,

87
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,360
what did they actually achieve ?

88
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,520
Does this change the facts
on the ground at all ?

89
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,200
I don't think it does.
This wasn't a strategic strike,

90
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,320
and hurting Assad going forward.

91
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,720
It's this one airfield,
it is a punishing air strike.

92
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,040
It took out aircraft, fuel supplies,
the surrounding infrastructure,

93
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,920
but he has other airfields.

94
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,240
It's true. He apparently
still has the one we bombed.

95
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,240
Syrian warplanes were carrying out
attacks from it

96
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,400
just hours
after our missile strike.

97
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,520
And that is hardly
a crippling blow.

98
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,760
Delta passengers experience
longer flight delays on a daily basis.

99
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,400
Maybe a symbolic airstrike was
strategically the best move for Trump.

100
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,200
But I don't think
he's thinking strategically.

101
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,960
Because he hasn't answer
some fairly basic questions, like:

102
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,160
if this was a warning shot,
what are we warning against ?

103
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,480
Do we only want to stop
Assad using chemical weapons

104
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,800
or are we going to push
for regime change ?

105
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,000
If he does it again, are we prepared
to go to war to stop him

106
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,080
or for how this may deteriorate
our relationship with Russia ?

107
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,720
How will that affect our fight
against ISIS ? This is complicated.

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,200
Not saying there are right answers.
There needs to be a tangible strategy

109
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,680
acknowledging how difficult
taking on Assad actually is.

110
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,320
We have a President
who feeds off praise

111
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,600
and he just got a "lot" of it
for bombing someone.

112
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,880
And that should make everyone
very worried.

113
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,520
Or, to put this in terms that
Brian Williams can understand:

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,120
there is a scene in "American Pie"
where Jim, played by Jason Biggs,

115
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,160
has sex with a pie because he wants
to feel like a big strong grownup man.

116
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,680
The concern is, that if we let him
continue down this path,

117
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,640
Donald Trump could become
that horny teenager

118
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,480
and the whole world
could become that pie.

119
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,560
So for now,
let's move on to FOX News,

120
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,560
Cialis and catheter commercials
occasionally interrupted

121
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,200
by an episode of "The Five".

122
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,000
FOX news has been rocked
by sexual harassment scandals,

123
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,800
and this week brought
one of the most damaging yet.

124
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,760
New revelations about sexual
harassment claims at FOX News

125
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,920
aimed at the network's biggest star.

126
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,960
New York Times finding FOX News
and Bill O'Reilly paid five women

127
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:10,000
a total of almost $13 million in
settlements, going back 15 years.

128
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,960
O'Reilly, who scientists hypothesize
is a dense nebula of boner and racism

129
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,440
has been paying out settlements
for alleged harassment for "years".

130
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,680
The victims claiming things
like verbal abuse, lewd comments,

131
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,880
unwanted advances and phone calls
in which it sounded

132
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,080
as if Mr. O'Reilly
was masturbating.

133
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,080
And I hate to ask this, but,
what does that sound like ?

134
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,920
Like a dog's jowls flapping when
it sticks its head out of the window ?

135
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,480
Or someone frantically
stirring a bowl of cake batter ?

136
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,400
Or was it more a subtle
"tap tap tap"

137
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,800
like a mouse
giving a round of applause ?

138
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,360
Either way, it is horrible.
It's not just those five women.

139
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,480
Dr. Wendy Walsh,
occasional guest on O'Reilly's show,

140
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,840
claimed he took her to dinner,
to offer her career advice.

141
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,040
She declined to come to his room,
his tone noticeably changed.

142
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,480
I ordered a soda water,
he complained about the cost,

143
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,880
said: I wonder what they're charging
for a cup of water here.

144
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,200
He told me my bag was ugly:
"the ugliest bag I've ever seen".

145
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:26,080
She is saying, when he got rejected,
he started negging her by complaining

146
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,760
about the price of seltzer
and criticizing her fashion choices.

147
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,880
In Bill O'Reilly's mind, every woman
wants to fuck her own mother.

148
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:40,480
It is hard for us to imagine
what it must be like

149
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,840
to be on the receiving end
of dirty talk from Bill O'Reilly.

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,480
But it's not,
as it turns out, impossible.

151
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,240
In 1998 he wrote a book called
"Those Who Trespass",

152
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,280
featuring numerous sex scenes.

153
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,440
And he narrated
his own audiobook.

154
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,640
And yes, we're doing this !
Here is a sample.

155
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,160
I would like you to unhook your bra
and let it slide down your arms.

156
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,800
You can keep your shirt on.

157
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,400
Cup your hands under your breasts
and hold them for ten seconds.

158
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,280
He slipped the hose down
to her ankles,

159
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,920
continuing to knead
her skin with his tongue.

160
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,880
Ashley climaxed twice before
the two got up from the couch.

161
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,800
Hot.

162
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,920
That is a man describing
a woman's orgasm

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,560
who has clearly
never seen a woman's orgasm.

164
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,960
You can't knead
skin with your tongue, Bill.

165
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,120
You've confused making love with
making a rustic sourdough bread.

166
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,120
We haven't even got to the most
stomachchurning part yet.

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,760
He had accomplished his goal,

168
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,000
giving Ashley Van Buren a night
she would long remember.

169
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,480
His physical pleasure
was secondary.

170
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,640
His primary euphoria came

171
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,360
from knowing that Ashley was
enjoying every bit of his expertise.

172
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,360
There has never been
a fictional character

173
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,920
more happy to not actually exist
than Ashley Van Buren.

174
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,440
And yet so far, FOX News
is firmly standing by their man

175
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,720
and is citing some
weak reasoning.

176
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,960
FOX's parent company points out no
current or former FOX news employee

177
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,320
ever took advantage
of the 21st Century FOX hotline

178
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,680
to raise a concern
about Bill O'Reilly.

179
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,560
So their defense is,
he can't be guilty,

180
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,800
because no one called HR
to complain.

181
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,800
Why would they ? I'd assumed
that FOX News' HR department

182
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,360
is a telephone in an empty room
being manned by a horny goat.

183
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,960
O'Reilly denies the claims,
accusing women of wanting money.

184
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,680
Wendy Walsh isn't even
asking for money.

185
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,920
She thinks everyone could learn
a valuable lesson.

186
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,760
All men need to learn that a workplace
is not a mating marketplace.

187
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,720
Bill O'Reilly, like the rest of us,
needs to just use Tinder.

188
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,280
No, he absolutely does not
need to do that.

189
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,360
That would be terrible for literally
everyone, except Bumble,

190
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,520
they would have a rocksolid
new ad campaign

191
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,840
that's going to hit hard
and hit well.

192
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,800
Whether O'Reilly is learning
his lesson here or not,

193
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,920
his advertisers are not
hanging around to find out.

194
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,640
We have seen around
60 advertisers go ahead and say

195
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,160
we're not going to run our ads
all round the O'Reilly factor.

196
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,000
Not good news for Bill O'Reilly.

197
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,640
I would say that he should call
his advertisers to apologize,

198
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,960
but he might start jerking off
while they're on the phone.

199
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,360
Almost nobody
is standing by Bill O'Reilly.

200
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,160
Nobody, that is, apart from
the President of the United States.

201
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,000
He's a person I know well.
He's a good personý

202
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,200
Personally, I think
he shouldn't have settled.

203
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,440
- How come ?
- Should have taken it all the way.

204
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,240
I don't think Bill
would do anything wrong.

205
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,880
Nobody gets to be surprised
because it is entirely plausible

206
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,600
that the hill our President
is willing to die on

207
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,840
is the one formed by Bill O'Reilly's
workplace erection

208
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,080
poking up
against his old-man slacks.

209
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,160
To recap this story for you:
Bill O'Reilly needs advertisers.

210
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,320
Donald Trump needs
to understand sexual harassment.

211
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,000
Here is where we come in.
As you may remember,

212
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,440
our catheter cowboy spent this year
appearing in ads on FOX News,

213
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,200
explaining the nuclear triad
and the American Health Care Act.

214
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,680
I think you know
where this is going.

215
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,120
We have produced an ad
to educate Donald Trump,

216
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,240
to air during the "O'Reilly Factor"
in New York and DC.

217
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,480
We submitted it to stations
on Friday, but weirdly,

218
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,760
we haven't heard back
from them since.

219
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,880
Surprising, because we're one
of the only advertisers

220
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,560
offering to buy time
on his show at the moment.

221
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,160
I hope they don't reject this ad.
But just in case they do,

222
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,720
here's a sneak peek of what we
would like the President to see.

223
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,680
Attention, patients.

224
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,960
Howdy. I'm a professional cowboy.
There's two things I know.

225
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,040
I don't like pain when I cath,
and repeated, sexual advances

226
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,200
or obscene remarks in the workplace
constitutes sexual harassment.

227
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,280
If there's a power disparity
between the two parties,

228
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,040
that's as inappropriate as
lubricating a catheter with hot sauce.

229
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,640
Why would you do that ?
I do not like pain when I cath.

230
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,920
If you've got a friend
who is accused of something like that,

231
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,960
I think twice
about defending him,

232
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,800
that contributes to a culture where
women don't wanna come forward.

233
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,040
I know you might not care about that.

234
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,520
But on some level, you gotta
know, you're blowing this.

235
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,080
You're sacrificing the chance
to make society a better place

236
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,760
on the altar of your towering
ignorance and fragile ego.

237
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,160
You are blowing this.

238
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,680
Goodbye everyone watching this
and definitely not one specific person.

239
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,120
See ya next time.

240
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,360
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns democracy.

241
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Undeniably the best Greek export
that doesn't have fruit at the bottom.

242
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,400
There is concern about the
personalities harming our democracy.

243
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,560
Let's talk about one of the major
structural problems.

244
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,720
Something that Democrats
love to complain about.

245
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:39,360
We've seen Republicans rig the system
by their often illegal gerrymandering.

246
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,040
Gerrymandering to a fare-thee-well
in states controlled by Republicans.

247
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,720
Political gerrymandering is one of
the greatest threats to our democracy.

248
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,720
That is a bit much.
The greatest threat to our democracy

249
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,040
is clearly whatever tweet the President
planned for Cinco de Mayo this year.

250
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,880
We don't know yet, which
Spanish words will be misspelled.

251
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,400
But we can assume
it will be horrifying.

252
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,720
Gerrymandering is a problem.

253
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,200
Practice of drawing voting districts
in a way that creates unfair advantages

254
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,800
for whoever happens
to be drawing the lines.

255
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,080
Which sound mundane,
but the results can be significant.

256
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,760
Gerrymandering is responsible
for giving Republicans an edge

257
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,720
in the House of Representatives.

258
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,640
Look what happened in some states
where they drew the district lines.

259
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,480
In Pennsylvania 44 percent
chose Democratic candidates

260
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,200
for the House of Representatives
in 2014.

261
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,600
But, 13 of the 18 districts
are represented by Republicans.

262
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,880
In Ohio, 40 percent of the voters chose
democratic candidates for the House,

263
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,160
but 12 out of 16 seats
are represented by Republicans.

264
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,760
Those numbers are out of proportion
to what people should expect.

265
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,960
You wouldn't accept Neapolitan ice
cream that was 75 percent strawberry.

266
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,680
How is that okay ?
What perverts voted for this ?

267
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,920
Whoever draws the districts
has a lot of power.

268
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,920
It's possible to use that
power in very precise ways.

269
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:17,240
In the age of computers, you can
gerrymander with scientific precision.

270
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,400
You can run in and out of alleys
and up and down streets,

271
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,920
so include and exclude
whichever voters you want,

272
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,280
so it's become
a very precise science.

273
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,480
He's right: gerrymandering has
become a very precise science.

274
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,160
It's one of the few
remaining types of science

275
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,120
in which the Republican Party
currently believes.

276
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,040
There are different reasons
politicians engage in gerrymandering

277
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,200
it's done to disadvantage voters
based on race, or on political party,

278
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,560
or to shore up seats for incumbents,
sometimes even within a party.

279
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,520
Take Hakeem Jeffries.
In 2000, he ran a strong challenge

280
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,720
in a Democratic primary
for the New York State Assembly.

281
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,680
He planned to run again
in 2002,

282
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,160
but the Democrats had done
something interesting to the map.

283
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,880
The map that was drawn
was absolutely fascinating.

284
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,080
They drew a map that literally
carved out the block

285
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,640
on which Hakeem Jeffries lived
from Assembly District 57.

286
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,760
I remember
shaking my head in disbelief.

287
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,120
A lot of people hoped to vote for me
but were surprised to find

288
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,000
that they no longer lived
in the assembly district

289
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,080
they had been living in
for years, if not decades.

290
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,200
Brooklyn politics can be rough,
but that move was gangsta.

291
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,600
Yeah, it was "gangsta"
and remember:

292
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,520
the threshold for "gangsta"
in Brooklyn is the Notorious B.I.G.,

293
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,440
whose debut album begins
with songs that are, respectively,

294
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,320
about armed robbery, gun violence,
armed robbery and gun violence,

295
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,240
being prepared to die by gun violence
while committing armed robbery.

296
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,280
Even the term "gerrymandering"
goes back centuries.

297
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,120
It gets its name from a 19th century
politician named Elbridge Gerry.

298
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,240
As Governor of Massachusetts,

299
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,960
he helped shape a congressional
district so blatantly one-sided

300
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,760
that one critic said it looked
like a salamander.

301
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,200
"No", another replied:
"a gerry-mander".

302
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,920
Now, that counted
as a joke in 1810,

303
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,480
when your entertainment
options were sunsets,

304
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,680
Washington Irving novels
and getting kicked by a horse.

305
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,240
You are not wrong to notice that
the "gerry" in "gerrymander"

306
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,280
refers to a guy whose name
was pronounced "Gerry".

307
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,680
Everything about gerrymandering
is stupid and wrong.

308
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,480
There is nothing inherently wrong
with re-drawing a voting district.

309
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,920
It's necessary. They need to have
the same number of people in them.

310
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,800
Populations shift over time,
as people move, or die

311
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,800
or emigrate because
their stand-up careers endured

312
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,240
what might be characterized
as a "pogrom of indifference".

313
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,640
Every ten years,
we have a census,

314
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,080
lines are re-drawn for both
the U.S. House and state legislatures.

315
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,360
The problem is, in most states,
the lines are drawn by politicians.

316
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,400
In fact, in 37 states, the drawing
of state legislative districts

317
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,640
is primarily controlled
by the legislators themselves

318
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,800
and they have a pretty clear
vested interest there.

319
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,760
And if you think that seems
crazy, you're not alone.

320
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,800
Every fall I speak to five or six
members of the British parliament,

321
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:35,120
one of the things I explain: "here's
how you get elected to the House."

322
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:41,280
I see these shocked looks
and one time one said:

323
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,840
"That's not the voters choosing
their representatives,"

324
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,040
"that's the representatives
choosing their voters !"

325
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,840
First: that's racist.

326
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:58,560
And second: even I find it difficult
hearing advice on map-drawing

327
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,840
in a British accent that once said:

328
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,680
"I don't see why one scrap of dust
is any different from another."

329
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,080
I ended the border here,
that's where my pen ran out of ink.

330
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,600
They'll learn to like it. What's
the worst that can happen ?

331
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,120
If your party holds the redistricting
pen, it wields substantial power

332
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,120
and there are multiple techniques
at its disposal.

333
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,480
There are a couple of ways
that you can reapportion people

334
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:28,960
and there's a thing called packing
and a thing called cracking.

335
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,520
Yes, "packing" and "cracking".

336
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,440
Not to be confused with the teen
drug trend of "cracking and packing",

337
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,440
which is when the teens
fill a cucumber with crack

338
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,960
and put in in their anus
to absorb it faster.

339
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,680
I saw it on the local news,
which means it's real

340
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,040
and every teenager
is doing it right now !

341
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:53,040
In this context, "packing" means
cramming as many opposition voters

342
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,680
into just a few districts.

343
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,600
"Cracking" means spreading them
out thinly over a bunch of districts

344
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,280
so they can't gain a majority
in any one of them.

345
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,480
Either way,
it dilutes their impact.

346
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,480
Try and think of it
as table assignments at a wedding:

347
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,520
you can either break up
your eight awful relatives

348
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,040
and spread them out
over different tables,

349
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,160
or you can pack them all together
in one table of the damned.

350
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,560
Washington Post showed how this can
work: look at this hypothetical state.

351
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,760
It's 60 percent blue voters,
40 percent red

352
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,600
and it needs to be
carved up into five districts.

353
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,880
Proportionally, you would want
three blue and two red districts,

354
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,880
but if you draw
the lines like this,

355
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,000
you can get three red majorities,
and two blues,

356
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,760
and if you draw it like this, you get
five blue majorities and no red.

357
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,880
And if you draw lines like this
it looks like a dick,

358
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,400
which is irrelevant,
but it is objectively very funny.

359
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,600
And if you are thinking:
"Shouldn't all of this be illegal ?"

360
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,800
Complicated. If you're gerrymandering
to disadvantage minorities,

361
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,160
that is illegal
under the Voting Rights Act.

362
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,080
If you are gerrymandering to
disadvantage voters of opposing party

363
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,120
that has generally been allowed.

364
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,160
So racial gerrymandering ?
No.

365
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,560
Partisan gerrymandering ?
That's kind of okay.

366
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,280
And it's led politicians to be
brazen in their behavior.

367
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,840
Like in North Carolina last year.
Their congressional map

368
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,160
was thrown out in federal court for
racial gerrymandering, which is wrong.

369
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,760
They had to redraw.
And while doing it,

370
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,960
State Rep. David Lewis went out
of his way to explain

371
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,560
the new map would not illegally
fuck over minorities.

372
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,360
It would legally fuck
over Democrats.

373
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:43,120
We want to make clear that we,

374
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,680
to the extent, are going to use
political data in drawing this map,

375
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,680
it is to gain partisan advantage
on the map.

376
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,520
I want that criteria to be clearly
stated and understood.

377
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,360
I need you to understand: this is not
a race thing because it can't be.

378
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,240
We just want a map that churns
out Republicans like it's Ann Romney.

379
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,960
That is all we're saying here.
Please let me understand.

380
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,960
And that map worked.

381
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,320
In 2016, despite Republicans winning
over half the votes in House races,

382
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,320
they wound up controlling 77 percent
of the state's seats.

383
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,320
A more blatant disregard
for what people want

384
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,560
than the asshole who gives out
Bazooka Joe on Halloween.

385
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,400
Gum from the Roosevelt administration

386
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,960
wrapped in a comic from
the other Roosevelt administration.

387
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,080
The guy handing out
Snickers stuffed with razor blades

388
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,920
actually gives you a Snickers.

389
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,440
Republicans elevated this technique
to art form with a plan called REDMAP,

390
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,200
or the Redistricting Majority Project.

391
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:54,520
They poured more than $30 million
into state-level races,

392
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,840
gaining huge numbers of seats
and that paid massive dividends.

393
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,640
When Republicans won the majority
of state houses in 2010,

394
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,280
it ensured they'd be redrawing
the maps in those states.

395
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,680
Lo and behold,
it paid off in 2012.

396
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:15,080
Nationwide, Democrats running for
Congress got 1.1 million more votes,

397
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,080
but Republicans sent 33 more
members to the House.

398
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,240
The maps they drew put Democrats
at a significant disadvantage.

399
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,560
It's like if,
instead of Tim Duncan,

400
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,760
the San Antonio Spurs
had had to use Tim Burton.

401
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:35,600
It's not technically impossible to win,
but it's going to be much harder.

402
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,480
And look: to some extent,
Republicans got lucky,

403
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,440
because 2010 was a wave election
for their party.

404
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,080
I'm not saying Democrats
are angels here.

405
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,160
They've gerrymandered the shit out
of districts in states like Maryland

406
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,000
and they've been brazen, too.

407
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,800
Take Illinois. In 2001, Democrats won
the right to redistrict there after,

408
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,040
for reasons too complicated
and too stupid to explain,

409
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,200
a name was pulled out of a replica
of Abraham Lincoln's stovepipe hat.

410
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,440
Watch as one Democratic lawmaker
made the least convincing promise.

411
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,760
We'll sit down
and draw a very fair map.

412
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,480
Come on.

413
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,280
That's an inherently
suspicious look on his face.

414
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,720
That's the expression of someone
who urinated in a public pool.

415
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,440
Water's warm today !
Enjoy your swim.

416
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,320
How do you know if your district
has been drawn with nefarious intent ?

417
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,360
That's tricky. Because too often,

418
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,880
people will lazily point
to districts that have a weird shape.

419
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,480
North Carolina's 12th district
looks like spilled coffee.

420
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,800
Pennsylvania's 16th
is flexing its muscles.

421
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:59,200
One commentator compared Maryland's
3rd to a broken-winged pterodactyl.

422
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,280
And then there's this,
they call it the earmuffs.

423
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,800
Yes, an earmuff district, not to be
confused with the Earmuff District,

424
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,040
an area of Manhattan
where sketchy men sell accessories

425
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,440
made from the fur
of endangered species.

426
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,840
You should go visit.

427
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,920
While it is tempting to see something
suspicious in an oddshaped district,

428
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,440
there is a pretty good argument
against prioritizing tidy lines.

429
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,400
Dropping a bunch of squares
seems fair.

430
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,920
Like if you could just draw a grid
like Tron that you could put people

431
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
into districts and there wouldn't be
any manipulation in the process.

432
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,720
But Americans don't live,
with the exception of Montana,

433
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:47,320
Americans don't live in squares,
our communities are irregular.

434
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,640
American communities
are not square.

435
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,520
They're like jazz music:
they're free-form, free-flowing

436
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,320
and they contain a troubling
amount of opioids.

437
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,640
And there is no one right way
to draw a district.

438
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,560
Reasonable people will disagree.
Some might prioritize a district

439
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,360
being politically competitive,
others might favor compactness.

440
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,320
Others want to keep so-called
"communities of interest" together.

441
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,800
It may be physically impossible to do
all three of those things in one place.

442
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,800
Take that Earmuff District.

443
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,440
The thin line connecting
the two halves is just a single road.

444
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,520
People love to make fun of that.

445
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,000
In Chicago, squeezed
between two freeways,

446
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:34,440
this narrow strip is needed to connect
two halves of a gerrymandered district

447
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,560
to keep it contiguous,
as is required.

448
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,840
This is the way Congress gets around

449
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,880
the contiguous rule because
there's obviously nobody living here.

450
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,680
Unless they're homeless people,
I guess.

451
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,800
Anybody here ?
Any congressional voters out there ?

452
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,280
Now you may laugh,
but a few seconds later,

453
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,120
an entire ghost baseball team
from the 1900s walked out of the grass

454
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,640
and beat him to death
with their ghost bats.

455
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,280
And he kind of deserved it.

456
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:10,120
But here is the thing: it is drawn
like earmuffs for good reasons.

457
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,880
The northern and southern
parts are two Latino communities.

458
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,520
The district in the middle
is predominantly African-American.

459
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,880
Both are Democratic, so it's not
about partisan advantage.

460
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,920
It's about ensuring both communities
have representatives.

461
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,720
And it's criticized a lot,
but redistricting experts love it,

462
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,080
two of them actually put it
on their wedding cake.

463
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,480
That is a real wedding cake !

464
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,520
The bachelorette
party cake was something like:

465
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,000
"one more night
of packing and cracking !"

466
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,560
Not all weird shaped districts
are bad

467
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,440
and not all normal shaped districts
are good.

468
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,840
Gerrymandering is not the sole reason
for the mismatch

469
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,440
between our popular vote percentages
and our representation.

470
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,440
Some of that is due to where
Democrats choose to live.

471
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,600
Democrats live in the wrong places,
they cram themselves in cities

472
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,280
and that makes it really hard
to have a winning coalition.

473
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,560
If you are college-educated,

474
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,640
you move to a city and those places
have enough Democrats already.

475
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,560
Democrats need to make places
like Des Moines or Columbus, cool,

476
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,240
but that's outside of the typical
realm of political strategy.

477
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,240
What do you mean
make Des Moines cool ?

478
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,800
They've already got
the Des Moines Heritage Carousel,

479
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,760
the most bad-ass, balls-to-the-wall
carousel in the whole Midwest !

480
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,200
According to their website,
it is closed for the season, of spring,

481
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,200
not a good time for carousels,
but when May 28th rolls around,

482
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,400
it's gonna be an all-out
carousel fuckstravaganza !

483
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,920
Until 8pm.

484
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,080
Democrats are basically
packing themselves into districts.

485
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,240
And that is not likely
to change soon.

486
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,320
But there is a broader,
non-partisan point here,

487
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,320
that in a democracy, the question
of who gets to draw the map

488
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,680
should not have as much
significance as it currently does.

489
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,760
There is a Supreme Court case,
involving a redistricting in Wisconsin

490
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,440
that was so partisan, a lower
court struck their maps down

491
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,120
and the Supreme Court may,
for the first time,

492
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,960
issue a clear ruling putting limits
on partisan gerrymandering.

493
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,760
Our hopes are now in the delicious
claws of Justice Neil Gorsuch.

494
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,600
Even without a ruling,
many experts argue

495
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,360
we should be taking redistricting
out of the hands of politicians

496
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,320
and give the task
to independent commissions.

497
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:45,520
A handful of states already
do some version of that.

498
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,720
It's not perfect. It is tough
to remove partisan biases,

499
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,360
a fact that one state lawmaker
brought up to shoot the idea down.

500
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:59,240
If I felt there were any way I could
stand before my constituents and say:

501
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,360
I believe that it's possible
to come up with a group of people

502
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,080
who have no political bias
who will simply sit down in a room

503
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,080
and magically create districts,
I'd be behind it.

504
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,960
I'd be behind it a hundred percent.
But those people don't exist.

505
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,880
If you recognize that guy,
you saw him ten minutes ago,

506
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,200
reassuring everyone that his intent
in drawing districts

507
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,040
was to gain partisan advantage
for Republicans.

508
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,440
He's arguing: nobody's unbiased,
so let's use me,

509
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,160
the most brazenly
biased man in the universe.

510
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,240
Which is pretty much arguing:

511
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,600
"no babysitter is perfect,
so let's just use Slenderman."

512
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,760
While commissions
might not be perfect,

513
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,400
they would be better.

514
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,280
It is hard to come up with a worse
system than the one most states have.

515
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,120
And there is something
important at stake here.

516
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,720
Lawmakers should not be allowed
to dilute our votes

517
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,040
by drawing their own lines
and picking their own voters.

518
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,880
I will tell you why.

519
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,440
The foundations of democracy
are built on the idea

520
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,160
that everybody's vote
should count equally.

521
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,520
Everybody's.
That is what America is all about.

522
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:14,120
Every one of us should get an equal
chance to make a bad decision,

523
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,600
which fucks things up
for everybody else.

524
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,000
Whoever we are,
however poor our decisions.

525
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,840
Whether you are a juggalo...
Stop it.

526
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,960
- Or a 47-year-old Quidditch player...
- It's a sport !

527
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,960
Or someone who bought
that stupid $6 000 jacket

528
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,920
I wore on the show last week,
it's horrible.

529
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,080
Our voices should be fully heard.
Even if we're scientologists,

530
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,400
or guys who ride unicycles as their
primary mode of transportation.

531
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,560
In this one context,
we should all be relevant,

532
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,320
regardless of our questionable
life choices.

533
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,600
Whether you're an EDM bro,
a guy jamming a knife into a toaster,

534
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,680
or a Washington Redskins fan
or even a Jill Stein supporter.

535
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,920
- She would've won !
- How ?

536
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,600
What process
could she have used to win ?

537
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,640
Her voice should count
as much anyone else's,

538
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,600
as much as a guy in a fedora
or a baker of erotic pastries,

539
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,960
or a Santacon attendee,
or everyone's racist grandma.

540
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,640
Don't say anything.

541
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,880
Because at the end of the day,
that is the point of this country.

542
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,480
That's what's made America great.
Because think about it:

543
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,200
election results should not be
the fault of lawmakers' crazy lines.

544
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,920
They should be the result of our own
crazy decisions. Am I right ?

545
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,200
- Am I right ?
- Yeah !

546
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,200
That's our show. We'll see you
next week. Good night !

547
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,480
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
