00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,280
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,400
Season IV
Episode 19

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,920
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,760
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,760
We have been away for most of July.
So we have missed a lot,

6
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,560
from Kid Rock possibly
running for the Senate,

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,040
to O.J. Simpson getting parole finally,
to Jared Kushner speaking out loud

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,000
following his testimony
before a Senate Committee.

9
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,120
My name is Jared Kushner. I am Senior
Adviser to President Donald J. Trump.

10
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,000
When my father-in-law
decided to run for president,

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,680
I served his campaign
the best I could.

12
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,560
I told you that's what
his voice sounded like !

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,480
You wouldn't believe me !
Now that happened on Monday.

14
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,960
If it feels like
that happened a month ago,

15
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,520
that's all thanks to Trump, who seems
to be bending the space-time continuum

16
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,720
in order to fill a week with more news
than it can scientifically contain.

17
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,600
This week may be notable not just for
the terrible things Trump tried to do,

18
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,000
but for how terribly
he tried to do them.

19
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,040
Take what happened
on Wednesday.

20
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,960
A policy pronouncement from
the President of the US.

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,800
He just took a major stance,

22
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,000
saying he will ban transgender people
from serving in the US military.

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,960
That is as hateful
as it is pointless.

24
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,000
It means that we may be entering

25
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,520
the Madlibs portion
of Trump's presidency,

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,080
where he persecutes
groups at random.

27
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,400
Transgenders
banned from the military.

28
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,640
Pacific Islanders can no longer
use the postal service.

29
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,920
Jews can no longer highfive.
Sorry, Jews.

30
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,720
Trump not only announced
this policy over Twitter,

31
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,720
but across three tweets,
the first of which read:

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,200
"After consultation with
my generals and military experts,"

33
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,240
"the US government
will not accept or allow..."

34
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,480
Then there was a nine-minute gap,
presumably while he finished

35
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,360
his breakfast of Big Macs
and mashed Doritos.

36
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,880
Even his own generals were concerned
about what might be coming next.

37
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,040
Generals
at the Pentagon were nervous

38
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,760
for nine minutes till
the second tweet came out,

39
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,760
they thought he might be
declaring war on North Korea.

40
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,480
A pretty scary thought.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,120
A "pretty" scary thought ?
No.

42
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,840
Trump declaring war on
North Korea with a tweet

43
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,320
is the scariest ten consecutive
words in the English language

44
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,600
and I am including:

45
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,800
"a clown waits for you in your
house, softly whistling"

46
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,880
and "sharks can fly now
and they know where you live."

47
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,160
As the military soon
informed the president,

48
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,160
it doesn't take its marching
orders from Twitter.

49
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,440
General Joseph Dunford said:

50
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,560
"there will be no modifications
to the current policy"

51
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,320
"until the order goes
through proper channels."

52
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,160
The military needs instructions
through the proper chain of command.

53
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,920
You cannot change policy
over the same channels

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,080
that Justin Bieber once used
to tweet

55
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,640
"random shoutout
to all my sexy ladies."

56
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,720
There was also a development
regarding the repeal of Obamacare,

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,080
which was a signature goal
for Trump's presidency,

58
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,200
along with passing comprehensive
pro-daughter-dating legislation

59
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,760
and getting to second base
with a truck.

60
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,600
This week, the repeal ran aground
in spectacular fashion.

61
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,760
The GOP drive to repeal Obamacare
fell apart at 1:29 AM Eastern time.

62
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,800
When John McCain flashed
a thumbs-down,

63
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,360
drawing gasps
and some applause from Democrats.

64
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,640
I haven't seen a group of senators
break into spontaneous applause

65
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,120
since every time
Ted Cruz leaves a room.

66
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,200
He's going !
Fuck that guy.

67
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,560
McCain's vote was
a dramatic moment

68
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,440
although CNN could not help
trying to amp up the drama even more.

69
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,560
1:29 AM, Senator McCain
re-enters the chamber.

70
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,800
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
stands at the front of the room

71
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,480
like he had most of the night.

72
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,080
McCain waves his hand to get
the attention of the Senate clerk,

73
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,800
pauses and gives
a dramatic thumbs-down.

74
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,240
Senator Elizabeth Warren
leans in to get a better look

75
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,960
and breaks into applause.

76
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,320
Senator Dianne Feinstein,
a single, assertive clap.

77
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,640
Senator Roy Blunt shakes
his fist at the heavens,

78
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,560
wondering how an omniscient
god could be so cruel,

79
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,040
Claire McCaskill does something
that looks like the Macarena

80
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,920
and the ghost
of Strom Thurmond

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,520
carves a racial epithet
into a wooden desk.

82
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:18,560
This drama took a back seat to the one
unfolding within the White House,

83
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,640
where Sean Spicer and Reince Priebus
have resigned,

84
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,280
following the appointment
of Anthony Scaramucci,

85
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,080
a former hedge-funder and
"Long Islander of the frickin' month"

86
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,680
for 643 months in a row.

87
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,920
Scaramucci's nickname
is "The Mooch",

88
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,200
which already sounds
like the name of a cow STD.

89
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,040
So neither one of us has been
with anyone else.

90
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,400
And yet somehow
I have The Mooch.

91
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,560
Is there anything
you need to tell me ?

92
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,960
"Tony Mooch" wasted no time
cracking down on leakers,

93
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,960
going on CNN to explain his philosophy
with an unexpected reference.

94
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,160
Why don't you honor the job ?
You remember Joe Paterno ?

95
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,120
What would he say ?
Act like you've been there before.

96
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,840
Act with honor and dignity.

97
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,440
It is a little loaded
quoting Joe Paterno

98
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,120
in the context of "everyone needs
to keep their mouths shut".

99
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,440
That "act like you've been there"
quote has been attributed

100
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,200
to multiple coaches,
including Vince Lombardi.

101
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,600
The Mooch still picks the guy

102
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,320
with a "child sex abuse scandal and
dismissal" section on Wikipedia.

103
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,880
If you were pregnant
and someone asked you

104
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,040
if you knew the sex of the baby,
your response would not be

105
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,800
"like Casey Anthony
once said: it's a girl !"

106
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,440
That Paterno line would have been
the craziest thing Scaramucci had said

107
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,920
until this.

108
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,520
Anthony Scaramucci unloaded on
Chief of Staff Reince Priebus,

109
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,120
calling him an expletive paranoid
schizophrenic, a paranoiac.

110
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,200
The most disgusting thing
he said:

111
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,000
"I'm not Bannon, I'm not
gonna blank my own blank.

112
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,720
"Suck my own cock."
That's what Scaramucci said:

113
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,000
"I'm not Steve Bannon, I'm not
trying to suck my own cock."

114
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,000
That's what he said.
To a reporter, on the record.

115
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,000
No point in anyone being coy
about this anymore.

116
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,200
Scaramucci's remarks put news
networks in a tricky position.

117
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,600
Leave it to Gayle King on CBS
"This Morning" to cut to the chase.

118
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,000
How is that even physically
possible, number one ?

119
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,920
When you hear something like that,
are you offended

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
or disappointed,
are you saddened by it ?

121
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,600
She's talking to Bob Schieffer.

122
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,920
Nothing in his half-century of
Murrow-Award-winning journalism

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,360
could have prepared
him for the question:

124
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,240
"Does the idea of Steve Bannon
sucking his own cock"

125
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,800
"make you angry or sad ?"

126
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,440
That is where we are, six months
into the Trump administration:

127
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,240
with a president who has no major
legislative accomplishments,

128
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,560
no conception of even the very
basics of how his job works

129
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,000
and a Communications Director
who answers the question:

130
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,000
what if a tanning bed
was a person ?

131
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,000
There is no public indication
from Trump

132
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,520
that he thinks he's doing
anything wrong.

133
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,120
This was his takeaway from
the failed Obamacare repeal.

134
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,520
They should have approved
health care last night,

135
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,880
but you can't have everything.

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,400
I said from the beginning,
let Obamacare implode,

137
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,640
and then do it,
I turned out to be right.

138
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,520
"I turned out to be right."
You got to hand it to him:

139
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,200
no one is better than Trump
at claiming victories from defeats.

140
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,280
I could see him,
at the end of his term, saying:

141
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,880
"I said I didn't have the ability,
experience, or intelligence"

142
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,080
"to be a successful president,
I turned out to be right."

143
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,640
And now, this.

144
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:58,920
More newscasters trying not to say
the words "suck my own cock".

145
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,360
I'm not Steve Bannon. I'm not trying
to expletive my own expletive.

146
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,520
I'm not trying
to suck my own bleep.

147
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,720
I'm not trying
to suck my own blank.

148
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,440
I'm not trying...
this is really graphic.

149
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,840
I'm not gonna keep just
saying blanking.

150
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,480
Bannon should perform
physically impossible acts on himself.

151
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,960
There was also suggestions
of physical acts

152
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,600
that require flexibility
that none of us has.

153
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,960
What he said about Bannon
which is, if true,

154
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,720
would make Bannon a gymnast.

155
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,680
Talking about self-fellatio.
Not like nothing I've ever seen.

156
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,320
Yeah, Bob. Bob ?

157
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,440
You're smiling at the way
she expressed it ?

158
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,840
For our main story tonight,
we're gonna talk about the media.

159
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,720
One increasingly
influential member of it:

160
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,120
Alex Jones, the Walter Cronkite
of shrieking batshit gorilla clowns.

161
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,120
You may be thinking:

162
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,280
"There is nothing more
I need to know about Alex Jones."

163
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,920
You've probably seen
crazy clips like this.

164
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,960
What do you think tap water is ?
It's a gay bomb.

165
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,960
Not saying people didn't naturally
have homosexual feelings.

166
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,880
You think I'm shocked by it,
because I don't like gay people ?

167
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,040
I don't like 'em putting chemicals
in the water that turn the frogs gay !

168
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,840
Do you understand that ?
I'm sick of this crap !

169
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,040
If he is that upset about a government
conspiracy that is not happening,

170
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,920
imagine how upset he's going to be
when he finds out about one that is.

171
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,760
Like the fact that the government
is turning raccoons bilingual.

172
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,880
They're all fluent in French and will
be working that into conversation.

173
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,920
That famous clip is
by no means an outlier.

174
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,120
Jones is a charismatic performer
who gets charged up.

175
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,280
There are plenty
of lesser-known outbursts, like this.

176
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,160
My spirit gets close to that evil
and my whole spirit just goes...

177
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,280
They call that crazy, that's not crazy.
That's my will.

178
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,960
My human spirit saying, crush those
that would hurt the innocent !

179
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,160
Go after the enemy !
Build a civilization ! Be honorable !

180
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,120
Crush the snakes under your feet.

181
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,280
Now we know what "Friday Night
Lights" would've looked like

182
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,880
if they'd given Coach Taylor
a nasty PCP habit.

183
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,080
Go after the enemy ! Crush
the snakes under your feet.

184
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,440
Clear eyes full hearts,
God there's snakes everywhere !

185
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,680
Stomp those snakes,
motherfuckers !

186
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,160
Ideally the first thing
you should know

187
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,560
about "The Alex Jones Show"
is nothing.

188
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,560
It is an important part of a lot
of people's media diets.

189
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,440
Six million people listen to his radio
show or watch it online every week,

190
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,160
and we know at least one Jones fan
seems to be

191
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,000
our current Russian Ambassador
to the United States, Donald Trump.

192
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,600
He supposedly called
Jones after the election,

193
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,200
tweeted content from Infowars
and one of its editors,

194
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,080
and a year and a half ago,
even appeared on his show.

195
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,560
I wanna finish by saying
your reputation's amazing.

196
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,040
I will not let you down.
You will be very impressed, I hope.

197
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,960
I think we'll be speaking a lot.

198
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,480
The only thing that could've made
that moment any grosser

199
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,320
is if Nigel Farage, Bill Cosby
and Phil Spector were on the same call.

200
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,760
No wonder Jones has been getting
a lot of coverage recently,

201
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,400
we mentioned him on our first
show of the season, in February.

202
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,840
And in his response to it, he seemed
a little annoyed with me.

203
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,680
Your ratings are in the toilet,
you're a joke.

204
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,760
They brought you back, revamped,
out of the gates to attack yours truly,

205
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,560
after you lectured us that Trump
could never win over and over,

206
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,320
you're the intellectual, everybody
knows British accent's intellectual.

207
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,600
Now you make fun of me out of context
and now go: "Look at this loon."

208
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,120
Hey, boy ! People want legitimacy,
they want real,

209
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,520
they want to hear somebody
that can touch 'em inside.

210
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,080
A few things there:
one, don't call me a "boy".

211
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,040
Two: my British accent
does not sound intellectual.

212
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,480
I sound like a chimney sweep
passing through a wood chipper.

213
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:23,560
Jones is right that people don't
present him in his full context.

214
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,640
So tonight,
we are going to do that.

215
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,120
Let's first set aside the key context
that Alex Jones has used his show

216
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,400
to fuel speculation that the Sandy Hook
massacre was staged by government,

217
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,320
which was hurtful for the parents
over the years.

218
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,240
That is disgusting
and it should be disqualifying

219
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,440
in terms
of ever taking him seriously.

220
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,280
Doing things that disqualify you
from being taken seriously

221
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,040
doesn't really seem to be
much of a thing anymore.

222
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,160
But there is a piece of context
you may be less aware of

223
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,160
and that concerns the nature
of Jones' show itself.

224
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,720
It is four hours long,
and if you tune in to the whole thing,

225
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,640
your most shocking discovery
might be how frequently and shamelessly

226
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,600
he pitches products
that he sells.

227
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,960
Remember that clip from him earlier,
yelling about snakes ?

228
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,320
Let's go back to that
and play it out a bit.

229
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,400
Be honorable !
Crush the snakes under your feet.

230
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,520
Get behind me, Satan !

231
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:25,240
Before I go any further,
we gotta fund this operation.

232
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,520
We got the very best nutraceuticals,

233
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,240
I don't know if I can run
this for another week or so...

234
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,080
I don't want to sell out
before more gets in.

235
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,840
X-2 the good halogen,
20% off infowarslife.com...

236
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,440
That is a hard turn. Satan-worshipping,
deep state globalists

237
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,120
are going to murder you
and your entire family !

238
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,480
Open your eyes, sheeple !
They're coming for all of us !

239
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,480
But first...

240
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,760
McGillicuddy's Oatmeal:
the perfect way to start your day !

241
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,960
That clip is not an anomaly.

242
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,520
In one week of recent broadcasts
on his site,

243
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,760
he spent nearly a quarter
of the time either talking about

244
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,920
or playing ads for his products,
or pointing you to the Infowars store.

245
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,560
If you have never gone
shopping on Infowars

246
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,840
you are in for whatever
the opposite of a treat is.

247
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,640
There's the kind of survival gear
that you would expect,

248
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,920
alongside more surprising items,
like organic shampoo,

249
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,600
body wash and deodorant,
as well as products

250
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,920
like "combat one tactical
bath wipes,"

251
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,080
a $10 pack of moist towelettes
that can be "used anywhere needed,"

252
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,200
"including the perineal area."

253
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,800
Which, if you're wondering,
is this region right here.

254
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,920
Alex Jones is trying to sell you
sloppy wet rags for your taint.

255
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,240
When you are done wiping down
the area between your genitals and anus

256
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,560
why not pick up a Bill Clinton
rape whistle,

257
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,480
which, according to Infowars,
should be used to

258
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,040
"let Bill know you're in the crowd
and that you know the truth."

259
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,320
That truth, by the way ?

260
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,640
You just spent
$6 on a whistle.

261
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,960
We bought this.
And by the way: our order came

262
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,320
with a free "9/11 was an inside job"
bumper sticker

263
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,240
that we most assuredly
did not ask for.

264
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,640
Radio hosts doing ads
is not inherently unusual.

265
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Since 2013, Jones has focused on
promoting his own products,

266
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,800
which he sells on his site,
under his Infowars life brand,

267
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,080
particularly vitamins
and nutraceuticals,

268
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,120
which I believe are the result
of the word "nutrition"

269
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,840
fucking the word
"pharmaceutical" from behind.

270
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,040
I'm pretty sure
that's what it is.

271
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,480
This is a big part of Jones' business.

272
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,440
Two-thirds of his funding reportedly
comes from selling his products.

273
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,800
And there are a lot of them.
And the reason I know that is...

274
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,880
We bought a whole bunch.
Let me break it down for you.

275
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,560
There is "Super Male Vitality".
"Super Female Vitality".

276
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,280
"Wake Up America Patriot Blend
Coffee". "Lung Cleanse".

277
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:15,800
"Brain Force Plus". Something called
"DNA Force" that costs $120 a bottle.

278
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,080
"Child Ease", a herbal blend
which, according to Infowars,

279
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,520
is "designed to soothe the mind
and bodies of children"

280
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,240
which is a creepy phrase.

281
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,360
And then there is "Caveman True
Paleo Formula with Bone Broth,"

282
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,120
a chocolate-flavored drink-mix
made from bee pollen, Stevia

283
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,240
and the dust of chicken skeletons.

284
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,400
According to Infowars,

285
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,840
it is "one of the most popular
new health trend in the world."

286
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,560
And by the look on Jones' face,
it tastes as good as it sounds.

287
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,240
You pour that in
on a couple ice cubes,

288
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,040
and folks, it tastes,
when it's creamy and thick,

289
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,760
I think better than Ovaltine

290
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,760
and it is got all the bone broth
and so much more.

291
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,120
This is why the ancients
had so much better bones.

292
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,320
You could freeze this and this
would be better than ice cream.

293
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:21,240
I know for a fact that Alex Jones
did not enjoy drinking Caveman.

294
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:27,640
I have got a glass of Caveman here.
I can confirm to you that it tastes...

295
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,040
It tastes exactly how you imagine
a drink would taste

296
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,440
that's made from chocolate
and domesticated bird corpses.

297
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,120
It comes at you in waves.

298
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,160
And that is not the only time
Jones used himself as a guinea pig

299
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,680
to sell his own products.

300
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,160
A warning: the following footage
of a man graphically too comfortable

301
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,240
with his own body
may be disturbing.

302
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:58,480
Ten minutes before we taped this,
we took photos a year ago,

303
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,080
and then again about six months ago
and the weight loss is dramatic.

304
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,920
Okay, so you're redder.
And you're wearing a belt.

305
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,160
The only thing I can discern
happened between those two photos

306
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,960
is that you walked shirtless in
the sun for two hours to a belt store.

307
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,440
You could flip those two photos around
and the effect would be the same.

308
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:32,760
He does have a medical expert
who consults on his supplements:

309
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,000
Dr. Edward Group III,
who looks like the lead

310
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,480
in a direct-to-DVD
Kato Kaelin biopic,

311
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,080
but he's even less
impressive than that.

312
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,520
Here he is explaining the importance
of one of the products.

313
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,240
If you're suffering from
abdominal pain, allergies,

314
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,480
even like headaches, anemia,
weakened immune system,

315
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,120
gut problems, depression,
hair loss, excess gas,

316
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,840
muscle pain, nervousness.

317
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,160
If you look at some of these conditions
and then us opening up our borders

318
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,240
and all the other countries
opening up their borders,

319
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,760
you're dealing with a mass amount
of parasites or harmful organisms.

320
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,360
You can type in
"refugees spreading disease".

321
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,720
The CDC is going crazy.

322
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,000
I am pretty sure that if you type
"refugees spreading disease"

323
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,720
it takes you right to the Wikipedia
page for "xenophobia".

324
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,120
Which at the end of the day
is a real time saver for you !

325
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,000
Despite Dr. Group
looks like what would happen

326
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,280
if Tom Petty was machine-washed
instead of dry-cleaned,

327
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,240
Alex Jones swears by him.

328
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,720
He has defensive
about Dr. Group's credentials.

329
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,160
You've got degrees from MIT,
and a bunch of other degrees.

330
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,000
The media makes fun of you
and says you're an idiot.

331
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,280
They say we cannot sell coffee,
it's a fraud.

332
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,840
I've been a research scientist
for a long time, I am MIT alumni

333
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,760
and I can tell you that
I do research all the time.

334
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,240
Okay, stop. Let's break down that
"bunch of degrees" Jones mentioned.

335
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,720
Group have a doctor of chiropractic
degree from Texas Chiropractic College.

336
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,880
But while he lists all these
other schools on LinkedIn,

337
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,560
he didn't graduate
from any of them.

338
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,320
We asked him, and he admits: he does
not have an undergraduate degree.

339
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,200
And as for whether
he's an "MIT alumni",

340
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,520
he completed a non-degree
certificate program there.

341
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,800
To be sure, we contacted MIT
and according to them:

342
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,960
"it is not accurate to say
he has a degree from MIT"

343
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,840
and "calling him an alumni would
be inaccurate and misleading."

344
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:47,160
Which does make sense, this man
does not look like an MIT alumnus.

345
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,320
He looks like a 5th-year senior at the
University of Falling Off a Surfboard.

346
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,840
Just to clarify, Alex,
that is what we are making fun of

347
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,720
when we make fun
of Dr. Group.

348
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,880
That and the fact that he looks
like what would happen

349
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,640
if Iggy Pop got "The Rachel".

350
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,200
Jones can inflate Dr. Group's
credentials all he wants.

351
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,360
He says a lot of crazy shit.
But it is noticeable that,

352
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,800
when it comes
to selling his supplements,

353
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,000
he can sometimes show a caution
pretty out of character.

354
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,720
Watch him bend over backwards
to repeatedly qualify what he says,

355
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,440
seconds after he's said it.

356
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,280
Maybe you've had back pain
or nerves cut off,

357
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,960
this creates tingling, a lot of people
had their feeling come back.

358
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,080
I'm not gonna make claims, research
true organically-based BioPQQ.

359
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,440
And it's not technically organic,
the other stuff's synthetic,

360
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,120
completely lab made, this is
made from organic sources,

361
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,280
but the bacteria's GMO,
I'll just tell you upfront.

362
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,000
It's not like the super
hi-tech stuff.

363
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,680
It's a bacteria that's just been bred
to be able to secrete and produce,

364
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,680
that's just like beer is bacteria,
a lot of good bacteria, obviously.

365
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,480
That's how the Japanese do it.

366
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,640
But it's bio-identical,
this stuff is only found in comets.

367
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,600
And in trace amounts
in blueberries.

368
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,960
Let's break that down. It repairs
nerves, but maybe doesn't.

369
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,720
It's organic, but not really.
It contains GMOs, which is bad,

370
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,160
except for when
he's selling you something.

371
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,800
You can only find
its ingredients in comets.

372
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,840
And blueberries. Iit's the drop-off
after that last one that is incredible.

373
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,640
You can only find this stuff
in dinosaur bones,

374
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,200
and in trace amounts in Ritz Bits.

375
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,280
Jones' products don't come cheap.
He sells this bottle of vitamin D3

376
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,760
for $29.95.

377
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,520
But ConsumerLab.com,
a supplement watchdog,

378
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,160
points out that you can buy
the same amount of D3

379
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,280
from other sources
for less than $4.

380
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,840
Jones will give you a hard sell.
He'll tell his products are different

381
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,920
than the one
you can find in stores.

382
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,080
And sometimes,
he'll go even bigger.

383
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,560
It is in the crystalline form,
the strongest, you absorb it !

384
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,240
Don't get iodine from, say, one of
the big chains. It'll kill you.

385
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:19,840
I did not know that you could
imply your competition kills people.

386
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,880
Four out of five dentists
prefer Trident gum,

387
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,840
and the fifth dentist is dead,
because he put Wrigley's in his mouth

388
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,680
and that's basically suicide.

389
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,600
To hear Jones tell it,
his products are marked up

390
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,920
just enough to keep
his business going,

391
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,080
as he explained on "Rationalizing
Low Ratings with Megyn Kelly".

392
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,320
It costs $45-50 million
a year to run this.

393
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,040
How much money is being made ?

394
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,520
The money made
is put back into things.

395
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,120
That is remarkable
for two reasons.

396
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,960
First, $45 to 50 million
is a lot of money.

397
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,400
Jones would have you believe that
every penny they earn

398
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,840
is being plowed back into a show
that looks like it was filmed

399
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,640
on the set of a low-budget
porn parody of itself.

400
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:12,520
He needs audience to buy more
to keep his truth-telling crusade

401
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,920
solvent and growing.

402
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,520
We fund ourselves by you
buying the products.

403
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,040
We're at a shortfall because of the
massive, sustained economic attacks.

404
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,920
But the listeners have almost
narrowed that gap.

405
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,920
I could have to sell my house
to keep this place running 3, 4 months.

406
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,000
I could have sponsors every
segment, I don't do it.

407
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,200
I plug enough to fund things.
Fund us !

408
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,120
Give me the energy
and I will attack the enemy.

409
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,360
Exactly. It's like an NPR pledge
drive for people who hate NPR.

410
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,360
To listen to Jones, Infowars
is on the edge of disaster.

411
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,080
He even has a link on Infowars store
where you can give him money

412
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,840
to "help fund the fight
against tyranny",

413
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,040
and contributors left comments
like:

414
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,200
"$25 may not be much,
but I know every little bit helps."

415
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,280
Jones seems to be doing a bit more
than keeping his head above water.

416
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,000
Ex-employees describe a thriving
business, with one saying:

417
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,320
"he can sell 500 supplements
in an hour."

418
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,200
"It's like QVC for conspiracy."

419
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:17,840
We noticed he's wearing
what looks like a Rolex watch

420
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,440
worth around $8,000,
which: cool.

421
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,200
As we looked around, we noticed
he also seems to have

422
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,880
another two different Rolexes
and you know: cooler.

423
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,960
That is honestly fine.
He can have fancy watches.

424
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,280
There is nothing wrong with him
getting paid. I get paid for this show.

425
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,120
But it does fight with his message
that he needs you to buy products

426
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,880
to help keep his show going.

427
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,120
Even Alex Jones seems to be
self-conscious about that disconnect.

428
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,240
He's reconciled it
in a truly amazing way.

429
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,560
I wear a blue sports coat
and a Rolex because it's a symbol

430
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,680
of middle class and humanity
having prosperity,

431
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,760
promoting human prosperity
for the respect of empowering humanity

432
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,320
and stealing the image of a man
in a sports jacket with a Rolex,

433
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,720
that is the Satanic image,
so I dress as a Satanist

434
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,200
so that I can enter their world
and show you it means nothing.

435
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,840
Bullshit. How stupid
do you think your audience is ?

436
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,160
You bought a Rolex so you
could dress up like a Satanist.

437
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:30,560
What are the other two for ?
Tormenting the parents of Sandy Hook

438
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,440
should comfortably
get you into the Satanic club.

439
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,680
That's the E-Z Pass to whatever hell's
version of "the champagne room" is.

440
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,920
I promised Alex Jones that
I would put his statements in context.

441
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,920
If you play small clips in isolation,
he looks like a loon.

442
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,400
But if you play them in context,
he looks like a skilled salesman,

443
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,120
frightening you about problems
like refugees spreading disease

444
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,960
and then selling you
an answer.

445
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,680
Remember that gay
frog clip at the start ?

446
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,840
He did a follow up show explaining how
chemicals were being placed in water

447
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,560
to feminize society
and reduce the population,

448
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,360
and then segued to this.

449
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:16,040
We sell five different brands of
the very best water filtration systems.

450
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,960
They cut out 99.99% of the
glyphosate, the herbicides,

451
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,800
the pesticides, the fluoride.

452
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,560
To an untrained eye,
it sure seems like he was using

453
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,240
the idea of a gay frog
to sell his products.

454
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,800
Which, is the same mistake
the WB Network made.

455
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:39,400
I am not saying the only reason
Jones is talking about the globalists

456
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,720
systematically feminizing us is
to sell overpriced nutraceuticals

457
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,440
so he can buy luxury watches.

458
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,120
But if I were saying that,
it wouldn't be the stupidest theory

459
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,160
that you've heard so far tonight.

460
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,480
So if Alex Jones wants his
words in context, this is it.

461
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,640
The fact that he happens
to sell so many solutions

462
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,920
should recontextualize how you think
about what he is claiming are problems.

463
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,320
How would you feel if,
at the end of this segment

464
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,720
that may've made you
feel a little dirty,

465
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,120
I tried to sell you something
to wipe that gross feeling away ?

466
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,760
Would you question my motives ?
I certainly hope not,

467
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,280
because that's what
we are doing right now !

468
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,600
Come with me because
I am proud to say,

469
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,880
that we've been working
with a leading medical expert

470
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,000
and I would like you
to meet him now.

471
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:37,400
Please, welcome
Dr. Ted Throup III. Dr. Ted.

472
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,920
- So happy to be here.
- We're so happy to have you.

473
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,760
We are here, the doctor and I,
to offer you

474
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,440
the John Oliver Moisture-Armored
Tactical Assault Wipe,

475
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,240
the first tactical wipe for use
exclusively on the perineum.

476
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,920
That's right,
don't use this anywhere else.

477
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:05,480
You're gonna want to just focus
on this area right here.

478
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:13,400
Now, doctor, how is this
going to make people feel better

479
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,400
about what they've seen tonight ?

480
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:20,000
My studies show that when
you vigorously apply this taint wipe,

481
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,200
it causes a sensation that distracts

482
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,360
the brain from what
it had been thinking about.

483
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:31,520
You've got degrees from MIT,
and a bunch of other degrees.

484
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,880
- The media says that you're an idiot.
- They do !

485
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,000
But just for the record,
you did go to MIT, right ?

486
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,520
I've definitely
physically been there.

487
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,760
- That's essentially the same.
- That's what I've been telling !

488
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:53,240
You can buy one of these wipes at
Infowipes.com for one million dollars.

489
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,480
This is real. They are available
for a million dollars apiece.

490
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,360
Don't think about buying
a similar wipe in a store,

491
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,080
those wipes will kill you.

492
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,840
These wipes have the power
to heterosexualize frogs.

493
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,040
So that's very nice to have,

494
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,480
'cause that's been a real problem
what with all the refugees.

495
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,400
This tactical taint wipe
has demonstrated incredible results !

496
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,800
Absolutely !
Look at this photo of me.

497
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,760
And now look at this photo
of me 45 minutes later,

498
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,640
after applying the taint wipe.

499
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,440
- You're much redder there.
- I'm so much redder.

500
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,400
- So much redder.
- So disturbingly red.

501
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,040
If you want to spend
a million dollars on a taint wipe,

502
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,920
go to infowipes.com.

503
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,920
And if you are thinking:
"no one's going to do that",

504
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,920
I will say: "people pay Alex Jones"

505
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
"$45 for a jar of chocolate-flavored
chicken juice",

506
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,040
so anything is fucking possible.

507
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,120
That is our show. Thank you
to Dr. Throup for joining us.

508
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,240
See you next week.
Good night !

509
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,240
