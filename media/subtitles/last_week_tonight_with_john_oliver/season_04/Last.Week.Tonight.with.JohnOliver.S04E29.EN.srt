LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,280
Season IV
Episode 29

3
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,520
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,480
Our thoughts are with people of Texas
following today's horrific incident,

5
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,080
details of which
are still unfolding.

6
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,400
I am sure that there will be more
to say about this in the days ahead,

7
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,440
but for now, we are gonna dive
into tonight with President Trump.

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,880
Statues of him will inevitably
one day be erected and later taken down

9
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,720
amid a storm of controversy.

10
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,320
The news surrounding Trump

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,600
was dominated by the bombshell
that dropped on Monday.

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,120
Huge developments unfolding
in Washington this hour

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,200
after Special Counsel unveiled
the first charges in his investigation

14
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,520
into Russian interference
in the American election.

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,240
Yes, it's finally happening !

16
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,920
The first charges in the scandal
we've been calling "Stupid Watergate".

17
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,320
A story that, like Watergate, could
end up toppling democracy,

18
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,800
but only because one of these idiots
slipped on a banana peel,

19
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,520
yelled something stupid like
"spaghetti-o !"

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,280
and knocked democracy over.

21
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,800
It is worth looking at Monday's
charges, they're incredible.

22
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,480
Let's start with Paul Manafort,
former Trump campaign chairman,

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,680
and his business partner,
Rick Gates.

24
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,160
The rap sheet against them
is impressive.

25
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,960
The 31-page indictment charges
that over at least 10 years,

26
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,560
the two men set up a scheme
to hide tens of millions of dollars

27
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,160
they received from a pro-Russian
Ukrainian political party.

28
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,000
The scheme involved hiding
that foreign work,

29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,880
funneling $75 million dollars
through unreported foreign accounts,

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,360
laundering tens of millions and lying
to the IRS and Justice Department.

31
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,720
That is a lot of charges.
Trump must be furious with them,

32
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,600
not so much for the part where they
allegedly lied to the government,

33
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,360
but for where they pretended
to have less money.

34
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,920
That violates the tenets of the sticky
issue of Fuckable Yachts magazine

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,280
Trump considers
his code of ethics.

36
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,720
While they deny charges,
details are damning.

37
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,040
Not all the money was squirreled away
in shell companies and accounts.

38
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,280
Some of it
was used to go shopping.

39
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,280
According to the indictment,
Manafort used the money

40
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,920
to enjoy a 'lavish lifestyle',
spending nearly a million dollars

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,600
on antique rugs and more
than 1.3 million on fancy clothes.

42
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,640
Over $2 million
on rugs and clothes ?

43
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,720
I can't speak to
the quality of his rugs,

44
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,480
but how is this guy spending
that much on clothing ?

45
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,040
He looks like he bought all the suits
that he was going to wear all his life

46
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,520
on one day in 1982 with
a cashier's check for $900.

47
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,600
When journalists tried to find out
where he got his clothes from

48
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,800
they got either denials or
"no comments" from Canali,

49
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,000
Isaia, House of Bijan,
Zegna and Brioni.

50
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,000
Surprising, because what brand would
not want, as its public face,

51
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,600
a man who looks like an extra
from a direct-to-DVD mobster movie

52
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,560
who fell asleep in a tanning bed ?

53
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,680
If I may quote the TSA agent assigned
to inspect Mariah Carey's carry on,

54
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,120
"let's set aside the $1.3 million
in clothes for just a minute."

55
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,880
And let's ask the question Trump
asks himself every day:

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,400
how does
Donald Trump fit into this ?

57
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,360
To hear him tell it, he doesn't.

58
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,000
The president revealed
his thoughts in two tweets.

59
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,240
Sorry, but this is years ago

60
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,280
before Paul Manafort was part
of the Trump campaign.

61
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,160
Why aren't crooked Hillary
and the Dems the focus ?

62
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,120
Adding also: 'There is no collusion',
writing all in capital letters.

63
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,800
All capital letters ?
I haven't seen such a forceful denial

64
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,600
since every men's clothing store
in two major American cities

65
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,400
denied supplying Manafort
with a closetful of boxy jackets

66
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,320
from the "dad's opencasket
funeral" collection.

67
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,880
If you think about Trump's defense,
which he definitely hasn't,

68
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,200
it's pretty strange,
'cause he's essentially saying:

69
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,400
"Manafort had already done
this stuff at the time"

70
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,600
"that, I, decided to hire him
as my campaign manager."

71
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,680
Which means either
Trump did a background check,

72
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,800
discovered his suspicious
activity and didn't care.

73
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,600
Or he didn't so much as Google
Manafort before hiring him.

74
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,120
Everybody
knows that Manafort is dodgy.

75
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,920
He has represented the interests
of strongmen around the world,

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,520
including Ferdinand Marcos,
Mobutu, Viktor Yanukovych

77
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,760
and Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska,

78
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,880
the last two of whom
had close ties to Putin.

79
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,160
It's since come to light
that Manafort may have been

80
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,080
"in debt to pro-Russian interests
by as much as $17 million."

81
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,360
And the more we learn
about him, the shadier he gets.

82
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,480
Prosecutors have noted that
Manafort has three U.S. passports

83
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,600
with different numbers,
and recently traveled abroad

84
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,840
while using a phone and email
registered under an alias.

85
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,920
Who outside of Jason Bourne

86
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,640
needs
three passports and an alias ?

87
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,840
Besides, of course, the Olsen twin.
Because she's got one for Mary-Kate,

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,600
one for Ashley
and one for Hilary Duff.

89
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,800
Right, there is also
no Hilary Duff,

90
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,120
it's just one Olsen twin moving back
and forth very quickly

91
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,680
and changing her hair and face,
standing still in a different place.

92
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,400
I'm so close to blowing
this whole charade apart.

93
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,840
Trump has argued that Manafort

94
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,960
was with the campaign
for a short period of time.

95
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,280
But he held top positions
within it for five months,

96
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:29,360
he also spoke on the campaign's
behalf, with decidedly mixed results.

97
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,200
Trump has no financial relationships
with any Russian oligarchs ?

98
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,040
That's what he said
and that's what I said.

99
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,280
That's what our position is.

100
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,840
There is nothing suspicious
about that response at all,

101
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,720
except for the sweatiness,
the stumbling

102
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,240
and the fact you couldn't
hold eye contact with the camera.

103
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,280
While Manafort may have been
gone before the election,

104
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,320
Gates, his partner, who prosecutors
say had 55 bank accounts,

105
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,680
has been a frequent visitor
to the White House.

106
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,080
So, again: did Trump know all
of this and not care ?

107
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,520
Or did he know none of it,
because he's incompetent ?

108
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,800
In other words: is Trump
smart enough to be evil ?

109
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,800
And before you answer, consider
the surprising news from Monday,

110
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,240
the guilty plea
from George Papadopoulos,

111
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,640
the former Trump campaign staffer
and real cool dude,

112
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,520
who has now admitted
to lying to the FBI.

113
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,000
He could be a real problem.
Because we now know,

114
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,600
not only did Papadopoulos have
contact with the Russians,

115
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,520
who told him that they
had "dirt" on Hillary Clinton,

116
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,360
but he mentioned his Russian
contacts to the campaign,

117
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,080
who responded like this.

118
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,600
A Trump campaign
supervisor told Papadopoulos:

119
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,640
"Pursue contact with Russians" and
that he had done "great work".

120
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,920
It speaks to the stupidity
of the people involved

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,520
that they left written records of
their potentially-criminal actions.

122
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,720
It's like if during Watergate,
we had an email chain

123
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,160
of Howard Hunt
saying "about to break in !"

124
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,240
and Nixon replying: "noice !"

125
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:28,280
This would not be stupid Watergate
without some truly idiotic details.

126
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,600
One of Papadopoulos's former
professors described him as

127
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,240
"zealous and a bit simple"

128
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,400
which, is also how you would
describe a golden retriever in ISIS

129
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,640
and some of his Russian sources
turned out to be unimpressive.

130
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,160
Papadopoulos was in London,
meeting with his Russian connections,

131
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,880
including a woman he thought was
Putin's niece but turns out was not.

132
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,160
We are living in an era where the top
New York Times headline could be:

133
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,560
"Shades McCool Got Catfished
by a Fake Putin Niece."

134
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,440
Trump is now also trying to
distance himself from Papadopoulos,

135
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,920
calling him a low-level volunteer,
a pretty weak defense,

136
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,280
because not only did Trump
once call him an "excellent guy",

137
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,280
they were photographed together
in a national security meeting.

138
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,120
That photograph was released
this week,

139
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,800
when the seal
on grand jury testimony was...

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,200
I'm kidding, Trump posted it
to his Instagram last March.

141
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,320
While that photo looks damning,
White House insisted it meant nothing.

142
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,400
How can you describe
Papadopoulos as having a limited role

143
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,360
when there's a photograph of him
sitting at a table with...

144
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,320
The president has thousands of
photographs with millions of people.

145
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,960
She is not wrong there. Trump has
taken photos with many people.

146
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,320
Here's one of him
with O.J. Simpson.

147
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,040
Here's one of Trump
and Harvey Weinstein.

148
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,800
Here he is with Grimace.
The president has smiled for photos

149
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,800
with murderers, sexual predators
and, in the case of Grimace, both.

150
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,800
But none of them got to sit
with Trump and his campaign staff.

151
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,560
When Trump was asked about what
happened in that meeting,

152
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,000
this was his response.

153
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,200
It was a very unimportant meeting.
Don't remember much about it.

154
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,520
You don't remember ?
That is convenient.

155
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,200
Although it's undercut
by one of Trump's favorite boasts.

156
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,560
People know me for my memory.

157
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,560
It's up here and
it's called memory.

158
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,320
I have a good memory.

159
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,360
I have a good memory.

160
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,720
I have a good memory
like a great memory.

161
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,920
One of the great
memories of all time.

162
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,400
There is just no way to reconcile
those two positions,

163
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,480
although Trump
tried in the past.

164
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,320
When he was asked in 2015
about claiming that he had

165
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,600
one of the world's great memories,
he said and I quote:

166
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,160
"I don't remember saying that.
As good as my memory is."

167
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,880
"But I have a good memory."

168
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,480
There are three people
from the Trump campaign

169
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,080
facing serious charges about
their entanglements overseas.

170
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,440
Trump's pushback has basically
been: "I don't know anything about"

171
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,440
"the people I should've known
those things about."

172
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,720
That is his signature move.
He is playing the Trump card.

173
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,880
He's using his own incompetence
as a defense.

174
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,160
It's the same way that you might excuse
the behavior of a dog, or a child.

175
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,560
If you found your dog
pissing on a rug

176
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,160
and your child urinating on the dog,
you would think:

177
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,720
"I'm annoyed, but they're idiots
who don't know what they do,"

178
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,880
so they get to walk away
from this one.

179
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,400
That is the Trump card.

180
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,560
The worrying thing here is,
it may work for Trump.

181
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,160
Because think about what
the counterargument may be:

182
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,680
"this is a meticulous man who
made strategic decisions,"

183
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,560
"fully aware of the consequences
of his actions."

184
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,400
But we cannot accept the Trump
card as his defense here.

185
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,560
Just think about
what we actually be saying there:

186
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,560
"this guy is too dumb to really
understand what he's doing,"

187
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,800
"so we have no choice but
to let him keep being president."

188
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,800
Please let's not do that.
And now this.

189
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:44,120
The inevitable, sad consequences of
morning shows celebrating Halloween.

190
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,360
Halloween has come to Channel 6.
I am the Gru and you are my minion.

191
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,120
I feel like I look like a Hamburgler.
I can be Hamburgler.

192
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,320
- On a mission from God.
- No, we're on a mission from God.

193
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,240
- Mario.
- It's-a Mario.

194
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,760
Nice.

195
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,960
This is Kate, one of our interns.
She is the Operation game, I guess.

196
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:16,600
We go over to Alissa Henry.
I gotta watch my corn stalks. Alissa ?

197
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,960
- How did it take to put all this...
- Two seconds.

198
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,360
- Really fast ?
- Yeah.

199
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,360
You'll be Wilma later on in the
show, 'cause we can't have you

200
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,920
reading the news in a costume.

201
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,640
It just doesn't work !

202
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,960
Developments in a Houston County
truck bombing case.

203
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,880
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns jobs:

204
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,720
literally the only reason that
anyone gets up before 11:00.

205
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,720
Politicians care about jobs
more than anything,

206
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,480
as you can tell from
how often they mention them.

207
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,800
These are the things I have
focused on: jobs, jobs, jobs.

208
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,080
Jobs, jobs, jobs.

209
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,480
Jobs, jobs, and jobs. Period.

210
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,000
Jobs, jobs, jobs.

211
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,560
It's about jobs, jobs, jobs,
good paying jobs.

212
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,640
It's about jobs. Jobs, jobs, jobs
and more jobs, American jobs.

213
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,200
Politicians seem to think
that jobs are like "Beetlejuice",

214
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,760
if you just say the word a magic
number of times, they'll just pop up.

215
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,840
I'd like to talk about one of the ways
that politicians try to create jobs:

216
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,040
economic development incentives.

217
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,080
I know that that doesn't sound
interesting... Wait !

218
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,640
You're putting me picture-in-picture ?
Is that "Entourage: The Movie" ?

219
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,600
Fine ! Switch over the audio. Listen
to the first line. You'll be back.

220
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,520
I may have to jerk it
before we even get there.

221
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,960
How about that ?
A show about economic development

222
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,680
doesn't seem like the worst thing
you could be watching, does it ?

223
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:01,000
So, as I was saying: economic
development incentives are essentially

224
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,800
when state and local governments
offer perks to companies

225
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,640
to entice them to build
or expand in their area.

226
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,040
In New York, there is a program
called "StartUp New York"

227
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,000
which launched
with astounding tax breaks.

228
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,720
StartUp New York creates zero
tax zones for new businesses

229
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:23,160
for ten years, zero property tax,
zero corporate tax, zero business tax

230
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,280
and zero income tax.

231
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,880
Zero property, corporate,
business and income tax.

232
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,040
That sound you heard was Trump
getting an erection.

233
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,680
Wait for it, it's gone again.

234
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,640
See you next year, little buddy.

235
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,240
It's not just New York,

236
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,200
all 50 states offer some kind
of incentives, like tax breaks,

237
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,600
to attract companies.

238
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,400
And the argument is that
they attract employers,

239
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,040
which attract jobs, which lead
to spending, which creates more jobs.

240
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,000
Many places bought into this hard,
trying to outbid one another.

241
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,440
Indiana even once took out
attack ads on other states,

242
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,240
like this billboard, which readý
"Illinoyed by higher taxes ?"

243
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,360
"Come to Indiana, a state that works."
And that's pretty aggressive,

244
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,120
it's much tamer
than their original billboard:

245
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,920
"just Arkan-saw your tax bill ?
Ida-hope you like our tax breaks."

246
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,760
"If you Colora-don't, we'll
Connecti-cut your fucking balls off."

247
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,440
And if a company is big enough,
it can even start a bidding war itself,

248
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,800
that is happening now with Amazon.

249
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,200
They are planning to build a second
headquarters in North America

250
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,680
and they are making
governments bid for it.

251
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,040
They released eight pages
of instructions for candidates,

252
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,600
telling them
"to think big and be creative".

253
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,520
Which led many cities
to do stupid shit like this.

254
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,080
Overnight, the Big Apple
looking more like an orange.

255
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,400
Mayor Bill de Blasio
lighting the city in "Amazon Orange".

256
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,240
The city of Birmingham is using
giant Amazon boxes

257
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,440
to try to get Amazon's attention.

258
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Stonecrest, Georgia offering to create
a new town of Amazon, Georgia.

259
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,440
They would create a new town
and name it "Amazon".

260
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,640
To compete, I'm surprised
Omaha, Nebraska

261
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,360
didn't offer to let Jeff Bezos kill
any three people he likes,

262
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,440
because you know he would,
he wants it so bad.

263
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,600
It's the only thing
he can't have and he wants it.

264
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,840
And numerous mayors
made direct appeals to Amazon,

265
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,040
with videos ending in versions
of the same bad joke.

266
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,680
Alexa, where should
Amazon locate HQ2 ?

267
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,760
In Frisco, Texas.

268
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:46,200
Alexa, where is the most interesting
company in the world gonna locate ?

269
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,840
Obviously, Washington D.C.

270
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,600
Alexa, where is the best place
for Amazon to locate its headquarters ?

271
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,040
Danbury, Connecticut.

272
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,240
I told you so.

273
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,920
My one and only worry,
sincerely, is:

274
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,200
are they almost too hilarious ?

275
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,320
Those stunts are window dressing.
What Amazon cares more about,

276
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,160
as they mentioned in their instructions
21 times, are incentives.

277
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,120
While few places
are revealing what they offered,

278
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,720
New Jersey reportedly
offered $7 billion in tax breaks.

279
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,360
An insane amount that other places
may now have to compete with.

280
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,880
That could be billions of tax
dollars that would not be collected

281
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,080
for things like roads,
or schools, or hospitals.

282
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,120
Amazon already has more money
than it knows what to do with.

283
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,320
How else can you explain
the existence of "Goliath",

284
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,560
a show that literally
nobody has ever seen.

285
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:55,760
Nobody. No human, no animal.
No one.

286
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,520
If you make a show and no one
watches it, does it exist ? Discuss.

287
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,280
We give companies a lot of money
through these incentives.

288
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,920
In 2015, they cost state and local
governments $45 billion.

289
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,840
That money can go
to some questionable projects.

290
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,800
Years ago,
Kentucky took a big swing on this.

291
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,040
A full-size replica of Noah's Ark

292
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,240
is drawing visitors to
Williamstown, Kentucky.

293
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,040
The Ark Encounter, a chapter from
Genesis told on a $100 million budget.

294
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,000
Four floors of Noah, his family
and beasts, great and small.

295
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,400
The project received $18 million
in Kentucky tax incentives.

296
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,560
$18 million of tax breaks
for a gigantic ark museum !

297
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,280
I'm not saying it's a bad idea.
I do want to see this thing,

298
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,320
especially as its website has a section
devoted to the question

299
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,400
"what about all the manure ?"

300
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,960
The answer is "slatted floors
or multiple-level cages".

301
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:10,000
Not a good answer, you don't want to be
the animal on the lowest level.

302
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,880
While the ark created some jobs,
there were caveats to those positions.

303
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,320
Critics complain of discrimination
in hiring. Only Christians.

304
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,960
No gays or lesbians, and single
people have to sign a chastity pledge.

305
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,560
Aside from the homophobia,
chastity is a pretty weird rule

306
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,320
for a museum that's a gigantic
replica of a floating fuck-zoo.

307
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,520
They weren't brought in two by two
so everyone would have a swim buddy.

308
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,720
They were on that boat to fuck.

309
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,680
To fuck !

310
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,440
But the justification for taking
a gamble on a gigantic ark

311
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,080
was that it would be a boon
to the area.

312
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,120
The economic impact
has been underwhelming.

313
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,400
The ark's success has not had
the ripple effect many hoped.

314
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,720
Downtown Williamstown, which
was expecting increased traffic

315
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,840
has almost as many empty
storefronts as occupied storefronts.

316
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,600
What's it meant
for downtown Williamstown ?

317
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,920
Nothing. I don't mean to sound
negative, but there's nothing here.

318
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,840
That makes sense.
Once you've spent three hours

319
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,720
walking around a wooden boat
with sexually frustrated tour guides,

320
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,400
and haunted by the image of
a miserable zebra, neck-deep in shit,

321
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,680
'cause apparently decks
were assigned alphabetically,

322
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,440
you're probably gonna skip
lunch in town.

323
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,120
A well-designed, closely-monitored
program with clear goals

324
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,120
might make sense to an area.

325
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,800
But too often,
the terms are extremely lax.

326
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,120
Some don't require that jobs
be created at all.

327
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,080
Some require almost laughably few.

328
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,120
Remember "StartUp New York" ?
Zero taxes for a decade ?

329
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,800
Shit. I'm sorry, don't think about it.
I'm sure it will pass.

330
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,720
That program's hiring requirements

331
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,600
were that you create
just one new job a year,

332
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,440
and the state considered scaling that
back to one new job in 5 years.

333
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,720
Sometimes, incentives are given out
even when they may not be necessary.

334
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,760
Take a look at Fargo, North Dakota.

335
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,120
He's not wrong and I knew
that would do the job.

336
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,000
Fargo gave a tax break to FedEx
for moving a facility to their city.

337
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,160
But why ?
Did they really need to ?

338
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,720
Listen to what happened when
one city council member asked

339
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,120
that question
of a FedEx representative.

340
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,960
If you don't get this exemption,
will you still move to Fargo ?

341
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,120
Yes.

342
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,400
Yet ten minutes later, the council
voted to give FedEx that exemption.

343
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,360
Why ? Also: if someone wants
to willingly move to Fargo,

344
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,560
you don't offer them
tax incentives.

345
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,760
You offer them a full psychological
workup that starts with the question:

346
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,120
"who did you murder ?"

347
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
"We'll still let you live here,
but we do need to know."

348
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:15,200
There are programs narrowly set up
to encourage an industry to grow.

349
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,800
Sounds great, but may not lead
to good, permanent jobs.

350
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,680
Take film and TV incentives.
In the last couple of decades,

351
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,400
nearly every state decided they
wanted to be the next Hollywood

352
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,800
and now, 31 states have incentive
programs for film or TV.

353
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,560
If you are one of them, you have
30 other states competing with you.

354
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,240
And because film productions
are portable,

355
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,320
if you scale back your incentives,
they'll go wherever a better deal is.

356
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,560
Listen to this producer, who has taken
advantage of multiple incentives.

357
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,920
I would never make a movie
where I didn't get an incentive

358
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,440
and I don't intend to.

359
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,160
If there's an incentive,
it's good for me.

360
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:05,200
He's not wrong. He looks like
every woman's worst ex-boyfriend,

361
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:11,360
but his job isn't to worry about
his incentives are good for states.

362
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,600
It is his job to refer to sushi
as "sush". He definitely does that.

363
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,760
But it should be someone's job
to worry about the effects.

364
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,960
When states have done that,
the news they got was not great.

365
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,040
Louisiana found that, for every dollar
it spent on its film program,

366
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,920
it generated
just 22 cents of tax revenue.

367
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,280
Which sounds bad, but which
is still better than Maryland,

368
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:43,040
which made just 10 cents, still better
than Connecticut's program,

369
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,880
which returned
only seven cents on the dollar.

370
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,160
That's like putting a dollar
into a vending machine

371
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,840
and getting a single
yellow Starburst.

372
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,400
At some point, what you're getting out
is not worth what you're putting in.

373
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,400
Defenders of incentives will say,

374
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,480
that's just a fraction of the broader
economic benefit that they bring.

375
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,520
The problem is, there's
not much evidence for that.

376
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,120
Accounting for the total economic
impact of anything is tricky.

377
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,120
But we are gambling billions
on little more than faith,

378
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,320
and even basic information
can be really hard to come by.

379
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,000
Three-quarters of major state
development programs

380
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,880
don't even disclose actual
jobs created or workers trained.

381
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,280
Throwing money down a hole
and hoping it brings us prosperity

382
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,800
is the exact business model
of a wishing well.

383
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,040
To see this at perhaps its most
pointless, look at Kansas and Missouri.

384
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,200
They've offered competing tax breaks
for years,

385
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,480
which made things
interesting in one metro area.

386
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,760
I'm in Kansas City, Missouri.
That's it behind me.

387
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,880
There is Kansas City, Kansas.
Two states, one metro area,

388
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,840
but both states offer subsidies
for job creation.

389
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,520
So what do businesses do ?
A Missouri business will move

390
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,560
some employees over to Kansas City,
Kansas and claim a tax break.

391
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,320
Move 'em back,
claim another.

392
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:12,120
Kansas City, Missouri lost offices
for companies to Kansas City, Kansas,

393
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,440
which, in turn, lost offices for these
companies to Kansas City, Missouri.

394
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,720
And that isn't creating jobs any more
than moving your couch

395
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,720
is creating fucking furniture.

396
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,560
This war has come
at a real cost:

397
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,480
a local foundation has studied
two state-level incentives programs

398
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:36,560
and since 2009, 6 600 jobs
moved from Missouri to Kansas,

399
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,560
while around 5 500 jobs
have moved from Kansas to Missouri,

400
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,160
there's been a net gain of around
1 100 jobs on the Kansas side,

401
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:52,120
at a combined cost of
$331 million in lost tax revenue.

402
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,720
You could create a program

403
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:00,080
where the first 1100 people to move
to Kansas City from Missouri

404
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,520
would each get a Ferrari,
which they could then drive around

405
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,280
a giant pile of $30 million
that the state had set on fire

406
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,960
and you'd be fiscally responsible,
would've saved the area $20 million.

407
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,720
Economic development needs to be
done in a much smarter way.

408
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,920
I don't fully blame the companies,

409
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,400
if governments are going
to offer ridiculous incentives,

410
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,080
they are going to take them.

411
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,600
Governments need to hold themselves
and companies more accountable.

412
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,520
If companies aren't producing
what they promised,

413
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,320
we need to claw our money back.

414
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,960
We're going to need much
more oversight over these programs

415
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,960
and what
we're getting in return.

416
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,560
I will tell you one thing that I know
for sure we got in return:

417
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,480
the Entourage movie.

418
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,280
That got a $5.8 million tax credit
from California.

419
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,960
Where else were they going
to film Entourage ?

420
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:03,520
Idaho ? So, California, know
you had a hand in producing a movie

421
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,320
which, may I remind you,
has this for its very first line.

422
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,840
I may have to jerk it
before we even get there.

423
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,960
I've got to say this: congratulations,
Kentucky Ark Museum !

424
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,160
You've become the second-worst
taxpayersubsidized fuck boat.

425
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,720
And now this.

426
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,520
Let's check in with Halloween
traffic and weather.

427
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,280
33 degrees, winds out of the west
at 13 that's making it feel like 24.

428
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,480
Things are changing. There's snow
embedded with the cold.

429
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,040
Seeing a few clouds.
We are expecting rain.

430
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,760
34 here but we're tapping
into cold air off to the west.

431
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,080
Sunday there is a cold front coming.
None of you are taking me serious.

432
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,480
We have an overturned semi-truck
and there's no ETA yet.

433
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,200
Over an hour delay from Pennsylvania
Avenue to the Wilson Bridge.

434
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:01,280
You've probably never seen this
before: the bodiless weatherman.

435
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,880
That northbound traffic
heading away from us there.

436
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,280
We've got zombies in the forecast !

437
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,280
The two other suspects. They're
charged with accessory to murder.

438
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,880
We are seeing clear skies
starting off your Tuesday.

439
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:27,280
And finally tonight, a quick word
on the United States Postal Service,

440
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,480
drivers of windowless white
vans you can trust.

441
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,400
It fallen on hard times recently.
It's massively in debt

442
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,680
and last year posted
a loss of $5.6 billion,

443
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,520
'cause why send a letter
when you can send an email ?

444
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,000
You could send a two-sentence letter
in the mail to your friend that reads:

445
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,080
"Finally saw "The Martian".
It was okay."

446
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,200
But that would be both
inefficient and deeply weird.

447
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,680
Postal Service is fighting
to stay relevant and cool.

448
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,440
Which is hard for an
organization whose uniforms

449
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,160
make you look
like a sexual predator on safari.

450
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:12,840
They try to get out there. And one
recent attempt is incredible.

451
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,960
Did you know that, since 2015,

452
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,960
the Postal Service has had
its own television show ?

453
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,640
It's on Saturday mornings
and it's called "The Inspectors",

454
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,640
and while it airs on CBS, its budget
is funded by the government.

455
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,440
And the show is pretty much
what you would expect

456
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,680
if a bunch of civil servants
had their own show.

457
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,360
I'm Preston Wainwright
and this is my mom, Amanda.

458
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,480
She's a US Postal Inspector,

459
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,080
she solves any crime
that uses the mail.

460
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,880
My dad was an inspector too,
one of the best,

461
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,080
until I lost him and the use
of my legs in a car accident.

462
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,840
I'm following my dream with
an internship in the crime lab

463
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,680
and the help of my best friends.

464
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,120
Together we are "The Inspectors".

465
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,200
The whole thing is a mix
of teenage soap opera,

466
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,680
police procedural and a PSA
about how to protect yourself

467
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,760
from mail related crimes, all
amounts to a kind of "CSI: Mailbox".

468
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,800
Its stars include this guy, who looks
like Anthony Michael Hall.

469
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,440
And you may think
I'm cherry picking similar photos,

470
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,240
but I'm not,
their photos are all similar.

471
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,200
Which of these actors was in the
"The Breakfast Club" ?

472
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,360
You can't do it !
That's my point.

473
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:36,000
There is something about
the aggressive tone of a cop show

474
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,880
and postal inspectors
that doesn't seem to quite fit.

475
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,120
I want to see my lawyer.
I know my rights.

476
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,600
Who are you anyway, the FBI ?

477
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,720
- We're postal inspectors.
- We've got a 98% conviction rate.

478
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,840
You're about to raise it to 99.

479
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,720
If a postal inspector
is your worst nightmare,

480
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,040
you need
to have worse nightmares.

481
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,840
There's a reason
that Freddy Kreuger kills people,

482
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,280
he doesn't fine them for
manufacturing counterfeit stamps.

483
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,840
About that conviction rate line:
that's not how numbers work.

484
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,880
Say they've convicted
980 out of 1 000 people.

485
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:24,240
By convicting one more person,
their rate isn't now 99, it's 98.1.

486
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:30,160
I'm going to give this
our official stamp of never mind.

487
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,480
Never mind. Doesn't matter.
Let it go. Never mind.

488
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,160
Episodes are 30 minutes long,
but I can run you through one.

489
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,400
A story featured the postal inspectors
involve in a cyber-ransom case,

490
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,440
after they find some evidence on
an envelope, and they work fast.

491
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,360
Georgia can match this
guacamole to the stuff on the letter.

492
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,800
We should have the results
in a few minutes.

493
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:03,560
The elements on the sample is almost
identical to the guac on the envelope.

494
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,560
Fiesta's over, Frank.

495
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,040
U.S. postal inspectors.
Up against the taco truck.

496
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,040
That is solidly written dialogue,

497
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,080
except for the part
when the guy says: "Man".

498
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,360
If someone whips out a badge and
yells: "U.S. postal inspectors",

499
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,920
the only natural reaction is gonna be:
"You guys have badges ? Why ?"

500
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,360
This isn't just about the cases. This
is a show that wants you to invest

501
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,360
in the histories and the complex
emotions of its characters.

502
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,560
With all the preparations
for this party,

503
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,560
I plum forgot to get you
something for your birthday.

504
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,440
You don't have to do that.

505
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:53,560
I thought I'd tell you why I became
a letter carrier after the military.

506
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:00,960
While I was deployed overseas,
every day I saw how important

507
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:06,680
a letter or a care-package from home
could be to a soldier

508
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:12,760
who was tired or scared
or was missing home,

509
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:17,440
it made all the difference
in the world.

510
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,920
I knew that when I got home,

511
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,320
I wanted to be a part
of that smile every day.

512
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,600
So, happy birthday.

513
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,480
That is officially the world's
shittiest birthday present:

514
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,280
Sorry, I couldn't get you a gift,
but how about I make you stand there

515
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,600
for what will feel like an eternity
while I talk about mail ?

516
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,320
That's a gift, right ?
I just gave you something.

517
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,080
The Postal Service made their
own behind-the-scenes video,

518
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,960
featuring Anthony Bootleg Hall
and the rest of the cast

519
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,880
talking about what
a great agency the USPS is.

520
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,720
The best and saddest part
is when they interview

521
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,720
the real-life chief
postal inspector Guy Cottrell,

522
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,280
who has an interesting assessment
of his status in Hollywood.

523
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,120
I came here, star struck,
looking at the actors

524
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,120
and the actors look at me
and the rest of our inspectors here

525
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,920
just as star struck because
we're doing the work.

526
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,720
As cool as it is for us
to see a TV show,

527
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,400
it's just as cool for them
to see real postal inspectors.

528
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,280
No, it isn't, Guy.
You're wrong about that.

529
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,040
You've misinterpreted the tone of
the actor who found out

530
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,080
he had to meet with you and said:
"I can't believe this is happening."

531
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,280
As this is a Saturday program,

532
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,200
it's supposed to be geared
towards kids and teens.

533
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,640
The main audience
for the show is 55 and older.

534
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,640
Not ideal. The postal service
needs to get its message out.

535
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,440
The point is to educate viewers
about things like mail fraud,

536
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,160
identity theft, and the importance
of postal inspectors.

537
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,720
It can't do that if it isn't
reaching the right audience.

538
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,760
What they need to do is insert
their message into popular shows.

539
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:13,000
Here is where we come in.
We've called in a few favors

540
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,600
from some of the most popular
shows and they agreed to help out.

541
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,160
First: there's this.

542
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,640
Laila McQueen,
Shante, you stay.

543
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,120
Misha Lopez, even though
you are a truly fierce tigress,

544
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,560
you forgot to check for watermarks
on postal money orders

545
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,200
and failed to turn on
two-step verification.

546
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,840
The Postal Inspection Service
can help you avoid scams.

547
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,320
If you can't love yourself,

548
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:51,880
how you gonna be
truly safe from identity theft ?

549
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,200
Now, sashay away.

550
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,400
Tell me that that is not
educational and fierce.

551
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,600
You can't, because it's both.

552
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,120
Not everyone watches reality shows.
What people do watch is "This Is Us",

553
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,720
which makes you laugh and cry,
and makes you wonder

554
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,920
when they're going to explain
how the father dies.

555
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,240
Why won't you tell us ?
Tell us so we can prepare ourselves !

556
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:26,800
If you could sneak some mail-related
dialogue, that'd be amazing, right ?

557
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,960
Take a look.

558
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,960
Hey, babe.
Did you get the mail today ?

559
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,960
I did. Once again, no suspicious
or fraudulent packages in it.

560
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,400
It's a good thing we
have a U.S. Postal Inspection Service,

561
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,240
otherwise I could be killed
by a mail bomb one day.

562
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,680
- It'd be terrible if that happened.
- Yeah, but luckily, it won't.

563
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,720
A mail bomb's definitely
not how I die, one day.

564
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,040
Even if you did die premature,
I doubt it would be from a mail bomb.

565
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,160
Yeah, definitely not. I'm gonna
live forever. I'm an invincible god.

566
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,680
See, perfect ? The key here,
as you've already seen so far,

567
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:14,000
is to do it subtly, a normal part
of a completely normal scene.

568
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,120
I'm tell you man it's like the system
is set up to keep us in here.

569
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,480
It's the prison industrial complex.

570
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,160
Ease up. Not everything
about the federal government is bad.

571
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,840
Let us not forget about
the hardworking men and women

572
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,560
of the United States
Postal Inspection Service.

573
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,880
True, the USPIS does guard us
from serious crimes.

574
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,600
Fuck that. The USP-I-S is trash.

575
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,160
I'm going to punch you.
I will cut you.

576
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,080
You don't know me.
You don't know the USPIS.

577
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,400
I told you to not be disrespecting
the postal inspectors in front of her !

578
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,520
If you'd like to know
more about them,

579
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:03,600
simply call
1-877-876-2455.

580
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,520
All right, I'll call them today.

581
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,120
You're welcome, Postal Service !
Our gift to you.

582
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,000
That's our show, thank you,
see you next week, good night !

583
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,280
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

584
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,160
END OF EPISODE 29,
SEASON IV
