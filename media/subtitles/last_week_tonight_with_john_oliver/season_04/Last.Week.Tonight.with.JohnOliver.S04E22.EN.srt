00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,880
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,480
Season IV
Episode 22

3
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,280
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,960
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,360
We begin tonight
with the White House:

6
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,120
still a beautiful building despite
what's happening inside it.

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,840
It's not the house's fault. Hashtag
it's not the house's fault.

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,320
On Friday,
there was some big news.

9
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:57,280
Another shake-up at the White House.
Chief Strategist Steve Bannon is out.

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,320
Steve Bannon is gone,

11
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,360
presumably to spend more time
sucking his own cock.

12
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,320
He leaves behind a legacy defined
by quasi-constitutional xenophobia,

13
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,080
unfulfilled campaign promises
and a definitive answer to:

14
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,440
"What if Martin Sheen
ate sea-salt for a thousand years ?"

15
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,800
While it was shocking,

16
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,400
Bannon is just the latest
in a string of recent departures.

17
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,760
This picture of the president
in oval office with his top advisors

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,320
was taken just days
after the inauguration.

19
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,560
National Security Advisor
Michael Flynn, gone.

20
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,720
Press Secretary Sean Spicer, gone.
Chief of Staff Reince Preibus, gone.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,280
And finally today, Steve Bannon.

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,600
He's surrounded by four white
nothings and Mike Pence !

23
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,600
Let's make that
five white nothings !

24
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,440
The truly depressing thing
about Bannon's departure

25
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,280
is just how utterly unsatisfying
it actually is.

26
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,360
One panderer to white nationalists
has left the White House.

27
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,240
The problem is, the one he was
working for is still very much there.

28
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,800
Trump doubled down on his
remarks about the group's march

29
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,800
in Charlottesville last weekend.

30
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,040
Not all of those people
were neo-Nazis, believe me.

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,920
Not all of those people
were white supremacists.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,320
You had some very bad people
in that group.

33
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,800
But you also had people that were
very fine people on both sides.

34
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,480
No ! They weren't !
And I'll tell you why,

35
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,640
because if you are marching
with white nationalists,

36
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,400
you are, by definition,
not a very nice person.

37
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,960
Let me put it to you this way,

38
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,760
if Malala Yousafzai had taken part
in that rally, you'd have to say:

39
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,920
"I guess Malala sucks now.
I don't know why she's there,"

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,280
"but Malala definitely sucks, that's
the only conclusion you can draw."

41
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,840
Condemnation of Trump came fast,
sometimes from unexpected quarters.

42
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,480
A key White House Advisory
Council of powerhouse CEOs

43
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,040
voting to disband.

44
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,360
Many of those leaders, Democrats
and Republicans speaking out,

45
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,800
like the CEO of Campbell's Soup,
saying:

46
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,800
"Racism and murder are reprehensible
and are not morally equivalent"

47
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,920
"to anything else that happened
in Charlottesville."

48
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,280
When you become
CEO of Campbell's Soup,

49
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,800
you do not expect to have to start
your public statements with:

50
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,320
"Racism and murder are
unequivocally reprehensible."

51
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,680
You expect to start them by saying:
"Yes we're very sorry but again:"

52
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,440
"you're the one eating
clam chowder from a can."

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,200
Commentators who are usually
in Trump's corner

54
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,880
had a tough time
defending his remarks

55
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,160
and none tougher perhaps
than Fox News's Melissa Francis.

56
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,400
He didn't say there were very good
people among neo-Nazi protesters.

57
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,600
There are people that were
opposed to the statues.

58
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,560
I am so uncomfortable
having this conversation.

59
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,480
That's what this woman said before
this, I know what's in my heart.

60
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,880
I don't think anyone
is different, better or worse

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,520
based on the color of their skin,
but I feel like there is nothing

62
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,960
any of us can say now
without being judged.

63
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:20,000
Here's a tip: if you're feeling judged,
for defending Trump

64
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,440
in his "Nazi sympathizer" phase
stop fucking doing it.

65
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,680
It's that simple.
No one's making you do it.

66
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,320
Also, how did you manage
to make this about "you" ?

67
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,600
That's almost impressive !
It was also fascinating to watch

68
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,440
Trump's own party try desperately
not to deal with what he had said.

69
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,360
Mitch McConnell, whose office
initially responded with a statement

70
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,800
that's "he had no new response
to Trump's news conference."

71
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,200
Although a new rumor
had started making the rounds:

72
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,680
Sources close to Senate Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell describe him

73
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,600
as "very concerned and very upset",
McConnell's office denies that.

74
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,440
McConnell had the moral courage
to deny anonymous sources

75
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,800
who had said
he had some moral courage.

76
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,360
"I will not stand idly by while people
drag my name out of the mud !"

77
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,600
"Leave my name in the mud
where it belongs !"

78
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,880
Others tried
to delicately thread the needle,

79
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,200
condemning the Nazis without
mentioning the president.

80
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,800
Take Paul Ryan, a man whose spine
ran away from home ten years ago

81
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,920
and is now living on a spine
commune in northern Vermont.

82
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,400
He tweeted that "white supremacy
is repulsive",

83
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,400
but did not mention "Trump".

84
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,360
Come on. You can mention him.
He is not Voldemort.

85
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,240
He's just a terrifying entity
who viciously attacks his enemies

86
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,920
and judges people based
on their birthright.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,880
I do hear it now.
I take that back.

88
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,160
That is not to say no Republicans
condemned him by name, some did.

89
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,560
Let's look at how many Republican
lawmakers called the president out

90
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,840
over his response to Charlottesville.

91
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,320
This is only a handful of the roughly
300 Republicans in Congress.

92
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,240
Exactly and that's actually generous.
That graphic includes John Kasich,

93
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,960
who isn't a member of Congress,
and Jeb Bush,

94
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,760
who holds no government
position whatsoever.

95
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,000
He's currently running his own frozen
yogurt shop in Orlando.

96
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,880
Apparently, their tropical mango
flavor is... fine. It's fine.

97
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,600
It's not going to change
your life. It's fine.

98
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,040
After the President implied that
good people were marching with Nazis,

99
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,680
the majority of Republicans
opted not to condemn him.

100
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,240
Out of 292 Republican
members of Congress,

101
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:51,160
only 54 could be bothered to
condemn Trump by name.

102
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,000
That is less than 20 percent !
The problem with not mentioning him

103
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,000
is that that suggests that he is
not a key part of the problem here.

104
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,880
So in the words of the poets
BeyoncÃ© and the other ones:

105
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,560
"say his name, say his name.
Go right on to Fox News."

106
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,360
"Say Donald I condemn you.
If you ain't runnin' game."

107
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,160
Although this week has been
repeatedly called a turning point,

108
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,320
I really don't see it.

109
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,160
Every day has felt
like a turning point.

110
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,840
We're not so much turning
anymore as spinning.

111
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,320
We're on a carousel that will not stop,
we've vomited so much

112
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,040
there's nothing left to throw up
and there's just no way to get off,

113
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,880
because an unstable race-baiting
carny is operating the controls.

114
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,000
We are going to go through a lot more
before Republicans will do anything.

115
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,280
Nothing is really going to change
in the White House

116
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,760
until one more person in that photo
finally gets shown the fucking door.

117
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,480
And now this...

118
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,240
And now local news
tries to answer the question:

119
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,080
should you stare at the sun ?

120
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,360
It's been pretty well established you
should never look directly at the sun.

121
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,200
You'll risk permanent eye damage if
you look at the sun without protection.

122
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,000
Peer through a dark beer bottle ?
Wrong.

123
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,640
Spray paint glass ? Don't do it.

124
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,960
Do not look at the sun like this.

125
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,240
It is always dangerous
to look at the sun.

126
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,400
Cannot look at the sun,
you'll be going to the hospital.

127
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,400
Don't stare at the sun
unless you hate your eyes.

128
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,360
Be warned, you could go blind.

129
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,160
You're not going to go blind,

130
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,200
but it is going to cause
significant damage to your eye.

131
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,480
There is no amount of time that's safe
to look at the sun.

132
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,840
If you look at the sun through
a telescope without a filter,

133
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,800
you lose your eye instantly.

134
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,600
Do not stare at the sun.

135
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,560
Don't stare at the sun.

136
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,080
It's the last time
I'm going to say it.

137
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,800
Do not look at the sun.

138
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,720
Despite everything we've been talking
about about this eclipse,

139
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,160
you're going to look
straight into the sun ?

140
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,600
I'm afraid I am, yes.

141
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,360
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns nuclear waste.

142
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,280
The worst type of garbage
for raccoons to get into.

143
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,600
It's a substance we know is dangerous,
thanks to movies like this.

144
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,600
They tormented him until
he had a horrifying accident

145
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,840
and fell into
a vat of nuclear waste.

146
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,720
Melvin became the toxic avenger !

147
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,880
The first superhero born
out of nuclear waste.

148
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,680
His face is so terrifying,
we can't show it to you now.

149
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,040
You'll have to see the movie.

150
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,200
Honestly you really
don't need to see the movie,

151
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,760
his face really
isn't that terrifying.

152
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,160
This is it. I mean it's bad but it's
so ugly, it's almost cute again.

153
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,440
It's like someone melted a candle
shaped like a pug.

154
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,880
Nuclear waste, the radioactive
and toxic byproducts

155
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,760
from making nuclear energy and
weapons, is a serious health hazard.

156
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,440
And America has a lot of it.

157
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,400
There are more than 71 000 tons
of nuclear waste

158
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,120
stranded
at the nation's 104 reactors.

159
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,720
Put all those
spent fuel rods together

160
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,440
and you get a pile as big as a football
field and more than twenty feet tall.

161
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,680
Or put them in a pile
as big as two football fields

162
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,440
and ten feet tall, or half a football
field and forty feet tall,

163
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,960
or twenty football fields
one foot tall.

164
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,680
We have a lot of nuclear waste
and it's very fun to play with.

165
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,480
That is just the waste
from nuclear "energy",

166
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,400
we also have more than 100 million
gallons of hazardous liquid waste

167
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,920
from producing weapons.

168
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,040
And you may live closer
to nuclear waste than you think.

169
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,760
One out of three Americans live within
50 miles of high-level nuclear waste.

170
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,920
Some of which, like plutonium,
is lethally dangerous,

171
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,880
and will be around
for an incredibly long time.

172
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,960
Even microscopic amounts
of plutonium, if ingested, are deadly.

173
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,200
One of the characteristics of it
is it has an extremely long half-life.

174
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,600
Plutonium 239 for example
has a half-life of about 24 000 years.

175
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,440
It's true.
And that just scratches the surface,

176
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,040
it takes ten half-lives for plutonium
to become harmless.

177
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,840
So that's 240 000 years.

178
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,560
A unit of time more commonly known
as one "English Patient".

179
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,760
As any adult with an American Girl
doll collection eventually finds out,

180
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,040
if you want to keep something
for a disturbingly long time,

181
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,880
you have got to find an appropriate
place to put it.

182
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,760
I cannot live with your murder
dolls anymore !

183
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,840
Felicity stares at me while I sleep !
She stares at me !

184
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,080
She stares unblinking !

185
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,280
I am not the first to make this point.
Look at this news report from 1990.

186
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,040
Almost half a century after
nuclear power was harnessed,

187
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,120
there still is no agreement
on where to store the waste.

188
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,360
We have built the house, said
one critic, and forgotten the toilets.

189
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,720
A home with no toilets,

190
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,200
or as a realtor selling a Brooklyn loft
is calling it: "artisanal composting".

191
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,760
You're suggesting
I shit in that potted plant,

192
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,520
we know that I will do that,
this is convenient to public transport

193
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,200
and it has both northern
and eastern exposures.

194
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,200
It has been 27 years since that clip

195
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,200
and our country still
doesn't have a nuclear toilet.

196
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:31,000
And that is our subject tonight:
why do we not have a nuclear toilet ?

197
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,600
It's easy to understand
how we got into this situation.

198
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,920
During World War II, we rushed
to develop nuclear weapons,

199
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,400
because we were trying
to defeat the Nazis,

200
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,720
who pretty much all Americans
agreed were bad at the time.

201
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,280
We didn't really have a plan
for what to do

202
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,680
with all the radioactive
byproducts that we produced.

203
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,520
And this initially led us to some
mind-blowingly stupid solutions.

204
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,720
For instance, for years,
we did this.

205
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,360
They loaded the radioactive waste
and it was in barrels,

206
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,600
55 gallon barrels of radioactive waste
with concrete poured over it.

207
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,080
It's funny the ocean don't glow out
there outside of Red Bank, New Jersey.

208
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,480
We dumped
a lot of barrels out there.

209
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,840
We didn't just dump barrels of
radioactive waste in the ocean,

210
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,080
we did it off the coast
of New Jersey.

211
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,000
That is so horrifying, I'm surprised
that "Jersey Shore" was the title

212
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:35,240
of a lighthearted MTV series and not
the name of a harrowing documentary.

213
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,880
An entire generation of children
was born without thumbs,

214
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,800
a phenomenon known
to locals as... the situation.

215
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,680
Not all of those barrels sank.
In fact, in 1957,

216
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,680
when two barrels were caught
floating off the shore,

217
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,560
naval aircraft were summoned to strafe
them with machine-gun fire.

218
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,880
They shot barrels full of nuclear
waste with machine guns.

219
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,840
That has got to be one of the
most terrifying sentences ever said,

220
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,600
right after "Donald Trump
is the president now"

221
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,480
and "wasn't Felicity on a different
shelf when we went to bed ?"

222
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,600
My God !
Felicity is a waking nightmare.

223
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,080
Although, tossing barrelfuls
of nuclear waste into the ocean

224
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,440
and shooting them with machine guns
is actually preferable

225
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,120
to at least one genuine other idea
that was thankfully rejected,

226
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,760
and that was blasting it into space,
a concept with a pretty clear flaw.

227
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,080
Unfortunately, we don't have
a great record

228
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,840
with getting rockets
out into the atmosphere.

229
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,720
If any one of them blew up,
that would basically contaminate

230
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,360
a large portion of the Earth
with radioactive material.

231
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,400
So that's probably not a great idea.

232
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,960
Yeah, you're right.
That's probably not a great idea.

233
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,400
A great idea would be also filling
the rockets up with confetti,

234
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,120
so if there's a horrific accident,
there's also a party.

235
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,040
Over the years, we dumped nuclear
waste all over the country

236
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,120
and in many places, there
have been frightening leaks.

237
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,000
In the Savannah River site,

238
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,720
waste from poorly-stored material
leaked into the groundwater.

239
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Watch this alarmingly laid-back man
explain the consequences of that.

240
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,000
There are radioactive
alligators on the site.

241
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,360
Radioactive materials
are in the sediments.

242
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,080
It's gonna go up the food chain

243
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,200
and there's going to be
radioactive alligators.

244
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,960
Yeah !
Radioactive alligators !

245
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,680
They even have names:
Tritagator and Dioxinator,

246
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,160
after two of the wastes
that poisoned them.

247
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,560
Because if I had
to give them names,

248
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,200
I'd have probably
gone with something like:

249
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,840
"holy shit a fucking
radioactive alligator"

250
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,280
and "no, fuck me,
there's another one !"

251
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,400
"What nightmare
hath God wrought ?"

252
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,160
It's not just reptiles who've been
impacted by nuclear waste.

253
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,760
Researchers are now studying
an area in North St. Louis County,

254
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,320
where waste from the Manhattan
Project was improperly stored,

255
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,880
some near a creek that winds
through residential communities.

256
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,480
People there noticed
some alarming trends.

257
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,000
I got on Facebook in order to reconnect
with people from high school

258
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,360
and we all started noticing
that so many of us were sick.

259
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:37,560
The Department of Veterans Affairs
recognizes around 21 cancers

260
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,680
associated with exposure
to ionizing radiation

261
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,920
and compared that list
to what we had.

262
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,120
We had all of those cancers.
Every single one.

263
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,680
That is an incredibly depressing
thing to discover on Facebook.

264
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,680
It's hard to know how to respond,
don't want to use the 'Like' button,

265
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,400
because then it looks like you
like the fact they just got cancer.

266
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,960
There is that new 'sad' emoji,
which would really be perfect,

267
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,560
if you hadn't already cheapened it
by using to respond to the news

268
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,360
that Chris Pratt and Anna Faris
were separating.

269
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:15,400
It is sad. But it's not "21 cancer"
sad. It's "nine cancer" sad, tops.

270
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,840
Sixty years ago, our government
and the scientific consensus

271
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,360
came up with a solution.

272
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,800
In 1957, the National Academy
of Sciences issued a report

273
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:32,600
urging the creation of a permanent
storage facility deep underground.

274
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,800
While we did build a repository for
lower-level waste in New Mexico,

275
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,160
we still haven't built one for the most
dangerous, high-level waste.

276
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,560
It's been left wherever it was made.
Those facilities were not built

277
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,040
with the idea that they would be
storing waste indefinitely.

278
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,680
So to continue the toilet metaphor,
we've been shitting in bags,

279
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,480
leaving them all over the house
and praying that they don't leak.

280
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,800
And the most frightening example of
this is the Hanford site in Washington,

281
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,160
which created two-thirds of
the plutonium in the US arsenal

282
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,680
and is storing 56 million gallons
of highly toxic and radioactive waste.

283
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,840
There have been
so many issues at Hanford

284
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,160
that they've achieved
a dubious honor,

285
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,840
as one local news station reported
with an almost prideful tone.

286
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,840
The most contaminated place
in the entire western hemisphere

287
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,080
isn't at a polluting factory
or an old chemical plant,

288
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,640
it's here in Washington state.

289
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,160
It's right here !
We did it, guys !

290
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,720
Home to the most contaminated
place in the western hemisphere,

291
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,720
thousands of acres of apple orchards
and several of Ted Bundy's murders.

292
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,480
We did it ! Right here.

293
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,120
There have been problems at Hanford,
from explosions to toxic vapor releases

294
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,920
to a million gallons of waste
leaking out of their tanks.

295
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,200
The government has had to pay out
nearly one and a half billion dollars

296
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,000
in compensation to workers
for illnesses

297
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,320
stemming from exposure to radiation
and toxic chemicals.

298
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,160
A local news station
has done a series of reports,

299
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:17,680
and they found the infrastructure
there is comically badly put together.

300
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,680
Mistakes in construction are factors
in the dangerous state of the tunnels.

301
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,880
They're 55 and 60 years old, well
beyond their expected lifespan.

302
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,000
Wood beams holding up
the tunnels are eroding.

303
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,880
And what corrodes
timber beams ? Radiation.

304
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,320
You can't build something out of wood
and expect it to last forever.

305
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,160
You learn that from the second
dumbest of the three little pigs.

306
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,840
Hanford is a gigantic problem

307
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,160
and even though it hasn't produce
anything for 30 years,

308
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,880
Department of Energy spends
two and a half billion dollars a year

309
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,000
on cleaning it up,
10 percent of its annual budget.

310
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,960
It is pretty weird to find out
that a place you just heard about

311
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,440
is getting that much
of the DOE's money.

312
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,360
It's like finding out that half
the Department of Agriculture budget

313
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,280
goes to this moose named Gordon.

314
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,400
I don't know the right amount.
But that seems like a lot.

315
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,840
If you're thinking: "I'm glad
I don't live near Hanford",

316
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,120
there are nuclear power plants storing
waste all over the country,

317
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,880
lots of it in so-called
"spent fuel pools",

318
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,080
and that's where nuclear fuel rods
are supposed to cool down,

319
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,520
and then moved to permanent
underground storage sites.

320
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,800
We don't have one of those.
And in many places,

321
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,120
those pools are accumulating
more and more rods.

322
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:52,120
If a Fukushima-like accident happens,
the results could be catastrophic.

323
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,400
The Northeast has a number
of nuclear power plants,

324
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,720
including the Indian Point Plant
outside of New York City.

325
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,440
If any one of those were to have
a severe spent fuel pool accident,

326
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,760
you're taking away a lot
of big cities, a lot of farmlands,

327
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,840
a lot of the United States
for decades, perhaps centuries.

328
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:17,000
That's right, lots of big cities.
New York, Hartford, Boston.

329
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,520
And that last one is a real shame
because as I understand it,

330
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,840
they only just got unracist yesterday.

331
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,000
I mean at least they could get
to enjoy their new life.

332
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:34,080
We need to find a permanent facility
to store our dangerous waste.

333
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,040
30 years ago, we settled on a site:
Yucca Mountain, in Nevada.

334
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,600
Congress passed a law designating it
as our sole candidate for storage.

335
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,920
Since then, we've spent
$15 billion prepping the site,

336
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,440
as you can see
from this rather upbeat video.

337
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,720
Located about 100 miles
northwest of Las Vegas,

338
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,960
Yucca Mountain is the most thoroughly
researched site of its kind.

339
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,680
Experts agree that the most feasible
and safe method for disposing

340
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,640
of highly radioactive materials
is to store them deep underground.

341
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,480
The best place to put nuclear waste
is in a hole deep underground,

342
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,880
much like Felicity.

343
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,560
Wait, if she's not there,
where is she ?

344
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:30,200
Jesus Fucking Christ ! Fuck me !
Get it the fuck out of here !

345
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,440
It's all right. I'm fine.
It's fine.

346
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:50,120
The point is... So: Yucca Mountain
is our permanent storage site,

347
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,040
so the problem is solved, right ?

348
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,760
No. Because while the site
has been deemed safe

349
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,560
and the people in the immediate area
actually support the project,

350
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,080
many Nevadans elsewhere
in the state don't want it.

351
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,120
And their former senator,
Harry Reid, lobbied hard,

352
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,040
managing to get Yucca shut down.

353
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,600
He had an alternative plan for states
sitting on their nuclear waste,

354
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,120
but to put it mildly, it was not
exactly scientifically sound.

355
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,120
Leave it on site, where it is.

356
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,200
Leave it where it is
in dry cask storage containers.

357
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:25,560
If you were smart, what you would do
is leave the thing where it is.

358
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,800
"If you're smart, what you would do
is leave the thing where it is"

359
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,680
is terrible advice
for dealing with nuclear waste

360
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,720
although, it is the title of Britain's
best-selling book on parenting.

361
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,400
Here is the truth: the scientific
consensus for decades

362
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,160
has been that leaving it where it is,
is a really bad idea.

363
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,200
The shuttered power plant
at San Onofre is storing nuclear waste

364
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,560
and it's on a fault line,
right next to the ocean.

365
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,160
Sounds like something you learn
in the first scene of a movie

366
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,680
starring The Rock
that you watch on a plane.

367
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:06,920
Maybe Yucca is the best place to store
our garbage, maybe it's not.

368
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,120
I am not a nuclear scientist.
I just have the face of one.

369
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,080
And our new Energy Secretary,
Rick Perry,

370
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,680
said that he is optimistic
about fixing the whole problem.

371
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,160
Although he didn't do exactly do
a great job dealing with this disaster.

372
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,880
Yeah, that was him
on "Dancing with the Stars",

373
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,800
and on the basis of that, managing
volatile energy is not his forte.

374
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,480
We've been saying that we are going
to fix this for decades

375
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,840
and we seem to be no closer
to a solution.

376
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:47,880
We've been researching this story
for a couple of weeks now.

377
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:54,520
Yesterday, we stumbled on a TV special
from 1977, the year that I was born.

378
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,880
NBC News presents:

379
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,520
Danger ! Radioactive Waste.

380
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,360
This problem is so old they reported
on it back when the news was kept

381
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,440
in an America-shaped vault
you had to open with a crank.

382
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,960
We gradually realized
that by pure coincidence,

383
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,320
it hits every beat of the story
we told you.

384
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,240
It opens with footage of sailors
throwing barrels into the ocean,

385
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,520
it looks at the facilities at Hanford,

386
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,400
talks about radiation's impact on
workers and on families nearby.

387
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,200
While it doesn't have
a radioactive alligator,

388
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,040
it does have radioactive cows.

389
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,960
Which is still good, although I did
prefer our alligator,

390
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,840
I liked it when he went...

391
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:52,040
But the most chilling moment
might be the one where they sit down

392
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,080
with someone in authority and demand
to know when this will be fixed.

393
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,400
When you ask when the problem will be
solved, you get answers like this.

394
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,840
What's the realistic timetable ?

395
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Timetable is scheduled to have
a repository in operation by 1985,

396
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,880
with a selection of the sites
by the end 1978 for detailed work.

397
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,360
Nuclear waste is a problem we were
supposed to have dealt with

398
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,920
in the 1980's
and still cannot solve,

399
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,600
much like this Rubik's cube
that I always carry with me.

400
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,000
You are my Jean Valjean, cube,
and one day I shall defeat you.

401
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,760
At the end of that special,
remember, forty years ago,

402
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,320
the correspondent delivers
this message.

403
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,840
The waste increases every minute.
The solution is years away

404
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,040
and none of the previous
solutions has worked.

405
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,680
We are accustomed in this country
to act only in times of crisis.

406
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,600
With nuclear waste, when
the crisis comes, it will be too late.

407
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,160
That was from 4 decades ago !
We have already waited way too long

408
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,200
and we are dancing
with trouble here.

409
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,920
So if anyone says the government
can just continue to wait,

410
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,000
they are, much like a house with
no toilet, absolutely full of shit.

411
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,080
And now, this.

412
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,280
Some of the actual responses
from potential jurors

413
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,680
excused from
the Martin Shkreli trial.

414
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,680
I'm aware of the defendant
and I hate him.

415
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,600
No.

416
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,800
By the time I came in and sat down
and he turned around,

417
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,400
I felt immediately I was biased.

418
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,840
He kind of looks like a dick.

419
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,280
When I walked in here today,
I looked at him,

420
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,320
and in my head,
that's a snake.

421
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,320
Not knowing who he was.

422
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,160
I just walked in and looked
right at him and that's a snake.

423
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,000
I think he's a greedy little man.

424
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,200
You'd have to convince me he
was innocent rather than guilty.

425
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,760
The only thing I'd be impartial about
is what prison this guy goes to.

426
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,520
Is he stupid or greedy ?
I can't understand.

427
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,160
He disrespected the Wu-Tang Clan.

428
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,200
That's our show. Back September 10th.
Thanks for watching. Good night !

429
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,800
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

430
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,040
END OF EPISODE 22,
SEASON IV
