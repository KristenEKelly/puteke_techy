00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,240
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,360
Season IV
Episode 25

3
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,000
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,160
Thank you for joining us and
we must begin with Puerto Rico,

5
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,480
where three million
American citizens continue to cope

6
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,800
with the aftermath
of Hurricane Maria.

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,120
President's response has been
widely criticized all week

8
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,800
and it still doesn't seem clear
that he understands the gravity.

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,000
The loss of life is always tragic.
But it's been incredible,

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,320
the results that we've had
with respect to loss of life.

11
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,320
People can't believe how successful
that has been, relatively speaking.

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,120
How are you even trying
to take a victory lap now ?

13
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,160
He could've
saved that statement if he added

14
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,640
"I kind of ramble, I know nothing,
I talk because silence sounds weird,"

15
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,280
"try and think of me as a parrot who's
memorized human sounds."

16
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,400
"Yabba Dabba Do,
Jumanji, byebye."

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,680
Getting aid to a disaster zone
is a huge challenge.

18
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,840
Trump's rosy assessment of success
has been disputed by many,

19
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,120
like San Juan Mayor
Carmen YulÃ­n Cruz,

20
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,800
who plead for more aid, and got
a depressingly predictable response.

21
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,080
The president tweeting
about Puerto Rico.

22
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,400
Such poor leadership ability
by the Mayor of San Juan

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,160
who are not able
to get their workers to help.

24
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,040
They want everything to be done,
it should be a community effort.

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,920
Really ? The primary obstacle
to hurricane relief

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,400
has been
Puerto Rican "laziness" ?

27
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,640
Anybody can say horribly racist
things about Hispanic people

28
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,200
on a golden escalator.

29
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,400
But it takes real balls to do it
while their fellow citizens are dying.

30
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,560
Trump is saying:
"When hurricanes hit our people,"

31
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,880
"they're not hitting our best,
they're killing poors,"

32
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,880
"lazies and some
have said nice things about me."

33
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,400
This debacle came at the end
of a week of embarrassments,

34
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,440
from the resignation of Tom Price,

35
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,600
to the failure of the Graham-Cassidy
Health Care Bill,

36
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,120
although to hear Trump tell it,
there is a good excuse for that.

37
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,880
One senator in the hospital.
He can't vote because he's there.

38
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,360
- Cochran ?
- He can't vote, he's in the hospital.

39
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm almost certain we have the votes.
But with one man in the hospital,

40
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,160
we cannot display
that we have them.

41
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,480
We can't do it now because we have
somebody in the hospital.

42
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,160
Which senator
are you referring to ?

43
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,760
In other words, he can't vote
because he's in the hospital.

44
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,960
Who ?

45
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,080
You probably didn't hear me,

46
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,440
one of our yes votes
is in the hospital.

47
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,560
I can't take him
out of the hospital.

48
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,120
To be fair, he couldn't take
that senator out of the hospital,

49
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,680
because there was
no senator in the hospital.

50
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,600
People thought that he may've
been thinking of Thad Cochran,

51
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,520
who tweeted: "Thanks for the well
wishes. I'm not hospitalized."

52
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,040
Cochran's staff released
a statement saying

53
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,800
he was recuperating
from a "urological issue".

54
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,240
So the president's lies
became so frustrating,

55
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,760
the only way to shut them down
was to publicly discuss the fact

56
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,840
that something may be wrong
with Thad Cochran's dick.

57
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,720
Think about what happened:

58
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,040
the president just repeatedly
said something not true.

59
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,960
That was wrong.
We just caught him in a lie.

60
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,880
In other words, and I have
waited a long time to do this...

61
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,080
We got him !

62
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:36,040
No, don't... I'm sorry !
He's still president !

63
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,880
I found out he is still president.
We didn't get him. I'm sorry.

64
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,440
I thought that Cochran
thing would do it too.

65
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,880
Thanks for coming in,
I'm sorry, he's...

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,120
That was great, thanks,
he is still president.

67
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,720
We didn't get him. I know.

68
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,600
I thought we got him.
I thought he was finished.

69
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,440
I'm sorry about that.
I'm sorry !

70
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,760
The senator
wasn't in the hospital, so...

71
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,960
I guess we've just got to carry on
with the show now.

72
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,760
Let's move on to tax reform,

73
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,960
the concept that gives Grover Norquist
a shattering nor-gasm.

74
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,880
The president has been
promising tax reform all year,

75
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,560
which usually means "a comprehensive
overhaul of the tax code".

76
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,320
In Trump's hands,
become much narrower.

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,920
At the very center of that plan
is a giant, beautiful, massive,

78
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,120
the biggest ever
in our country, tax cut.

79
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,840
So to be clear: a tax cut
is not just at the center of his plan.

80
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,800
It basically is his plan.
It's like saying:

81
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,040
"at the center
of this egg is an egg".

82
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,640
Yes, of course, it's an egg.
That's all it is.

83
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,880
While the plan is light on detail,
when the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center

84
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,840
tried to create an estimate,
they found that, by 2027,

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,880
it could raise taxes
on many middle-class families

86
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,520
and that 80% of the benefits would go
to taxpayers in the top 1 percent.

87
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,640
Trump's Treasury Secretary
Steven Mnuchin, also known as me,

88
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,240
John Oliver, after waking up from a
surgery to have my morals removed,

89
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,160
he dismissed those concerns.

90
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,440
I don't know how the Tax Policy Center
can publish those figures

91
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,080
since they don't have all the details,
including the brackets.

92
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,800
Tax Foundation and others waited,
which I think is responsible.

93
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,960
Okay, so first: I'm just gonna
say this. I think he's handsome.

94
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,520
Yes, not in a conventional way.
But, you know, he's striking.

95
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,240
It is hard to hear Mnuchin urge
people to withhold judgment,

96
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,320
when this administration has been
out aggressively selling this plan.

97
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,120
Take Trump's Chief Economic
Advisor Gary Cohn,

98
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,760
the answer to the question:

99
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,840
"What if Daddy Warbucks never met
Annie and just kept being an asshole ?"

100
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,560
He spoke to reporters and game out
how a middle-class family

101
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,920
could spend
their hypothetical tax cut.

102
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,080
If we allow a family to keep
another thousand dollars,

103
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,400
what does that mean ?

104
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,920
They can renovate their kitchen,
they can buy a new car,

105
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,520
they can take a family vacation,
increase their lifestyle.

106
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,600
Hold on: a thousand dollars
for a kitchen renovation ?

107
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,920
Or a new car ?
He's talking about $1 000

108
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,560
like a cartoon hobo
from the 1920's.

109
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,960
"If I ever got that kinda money,
I'd buy myself a private island."

110
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,560
"I'd eat caviar three times a day
and my butler would be a seal."

111
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,960
"I'd never have to worry
about nothin' never again."

112
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,960
As for the president himself,
he is insisting that wealthy Americans,

113
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,480
including himself, will not benefit.

114
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,280
Our framework includes
our explicit commitment

115
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,760
that tax reform will protect low-income
and middle-income households,

116
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,360
not the wealthy
and well-connected.

117
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,480
They can call me all they want,
it's not going to help,

118
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,440
I'm doing the right thing and it's not
good for me, believe me.

119
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,600
I don't believe you at all !
And you know why ?

120
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,320
Just one element of the plan,
the elimination of the estate tax,

121
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,520
could save Trump's family
as much as a billion dollars.

122
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,880
So, again: he's wrong. We just
caught him in another lie.

123
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,160
This time, I am going to call it:
we got him !

124
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,520
That's fair. And now, this.

125
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:50,200
Guy Fieri gives a surprisingly detailed
tour of his favorite place on Earth.

126
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,560
I'm Guy Fieri
and you know what I need ?

127
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,600
I need you riding shotgun.
I'm on my way to Flavortown.

128
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,640
That's a dusty road to Flavortown.

129
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,600
This is a train to Flavortown, dude.
Ravioli train to Flavortown.

130
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,240
That's Flavortown pass forth.
A $10 lift ticket to Flavortown.

131
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,720
You can find that at the library.
Mining for food in Flavortown river.

132
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,320
There's a culinary buoys.
This is a road cone in Flavortown.

133
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,720
A manhole cover in Flavortown.
The community pool of Flavortown.

134
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,680
A punchbowl at the meat buffet.
She threw away the dental floss.

135
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,760
Making a brick at the capital
of Flavortown.

136
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,720
The artillery center
in Flavortown.

137
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,400
This is the first discovered
culinary cave of Flavortown.

138
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,680
The nacho crown
in the kingdom of Flavortown.

139
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,360
That's the definition of stupid,
stupid in the good way.

140
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,520
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns crime.

141
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,400
That thing that was almost
solved by a flasher dog in the 1980s.

142
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,520
This story is how we solve crimes
using forensic evidence,

143
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,840
it's that thing that is just
a staple of TV crime shows.

144
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,440
Bullet from the torso on the left,
bullet from the boat on the right.

145
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,840
Two hearts beat as one.

146
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,360
Matches up perfectly.

147
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,040
That's a match.

148
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,320
- We've got a match.
- I just found us a match.

149
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
- Visible match.
- Match.

150
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,080
Were you able to determine
which monkey bit him ?

151
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,560
Bite marks matched
the monkey at the scene.

152
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,120
That last one was presumably
from one crossover episode,

153
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,400
where the team from Law & Order
worked a case with the cast

154
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,360
of
"Monkey Law & Monkey Order".

155
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,240
But on TV and in real life,
forensic science plays

156
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,760
an important role
in criminal convictions.

157
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,920
Prosecutors complain
about a so-called "CSI effect",

158
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,400
where jurors expect to see
forensic evidence in every case.

159
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,160
Not all forensic science
is as reliable as we believe.

160
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,800
A report in 2009
found that many forensic sciences

161
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,000
"do not meet the fundamental
requirements of science."

162
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,440
A report last year by
a presidential science council agreed:

163
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,120
"expert witnesses have overstated
the value of their evidence,"

164
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,320
"going beyond what the relevant
science can justify."

165
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,800
It's not that all forensic science
is bad, 'cause it's not.

166
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,000
Too often, its reliability
is dangerously overstated.

167
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,920
One sign of that
is that forensic experts in court

168
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,880
are often nudged to use
one very convincing phrase.

169
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:35,520
To a reasonable degree
of scientific certainty.

170
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,360
Within a reasonable
scientific certainty.

171
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,200
To a reasonable degree
of scientific certainty.

172
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,160
You say that within a reasonable
degree of scientific certainty ?

173
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,400
That phrase does have
a persuasive ring to it.

174
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,880
As that presidential council
pointed out:

175
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,200
it "has no generally
accepted meaning in science."

176
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,120
It's one of those terms like
"basic" or "trill"

177
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,840
that has no commonly
understood definition.

178
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,760
Am I trill ? Is that good or bad ?

179
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,560
I do "feel" trill,
so I'm guessing it's awful.

180
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,280
When bad science
is confidently presented,

181
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,320
terrible convictions can happen.

182
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,320
Among the hundreds of people
who've been exonerated

183
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,600
by DNA testing since 1989,
in nearly half of their cases,

184
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,400
there was misapplication
of forensic science.

185
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,480
Santae Tribble was convicted
of murder and served 26 years,

186
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,000
thanks to an FBI analyst
who testified that his hair

187
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,000
matched hairs
found at the scene.

188
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,120
The evidence
was presented as rocksolid.

189
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,800
They said they match my hair
in all microscopical characteristics.

190
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,960
That's the way they presented
it to the jury

191
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,720
and the jury took it for granted
that that was my hair.

192
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,480
I can see why they did.
Because who other than an FBI expert

193
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,200
would possibly know
that much about hair ?

194
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,840
Except for whoever styled
Amanda Seyfried at the 2009 Oscars.

195
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,720
Breathtaking waves, without
losing any of their body or bounce.

196
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,240
Stunning.

197
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,160
Stunning.

198
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,800
Stunning.

199
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,480
Jurors in Tribble's case
were actually told

200
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,600
there was one chance in ten million
that it could be someone else's hair.

201
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,400
He was exonerated.
Once DNA analysis became available,

202
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,040
his lawyer tested
the 13 hairs from the case

203
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,440
and not only were none of them his,
some of what they found was incredible.

204
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,560
Nine of the hairs had come
from the same source

205
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,960
and one was a dog.

206
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,120
Two different FBI agents
who analyzed it

207
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,520
didn't recognize
that it was dog hair ?

208
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,160
It was a canine.
It was a domestic dog, yes.

209
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:55,160
My personal conclusion was
the dog committed the crime.

210
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,680
So, first: it is amazing
that he is able to laugh at that.

211
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,240
Second: if a dog
did commit the crime,

212
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,880
there's no recourse,
because there is no law

213
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,600
against dogs committing murder
and that's a fact that I learned in

214
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,680
"Air Bud Nine:
Fuck the Paw-Lice."

215
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,160
Tribble is not the only case
where FBI experts

216
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,920
overstated their confidence
in their results.

217
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,160
Innocence Project and Association
of Criminal Defense Lawyers

218
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,120
found from the 1970s through 1999,

219
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,880
in 268 cases where FBI hair
analysis led to a conviction,

220
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,440
257, or 96% of them,
had errors in analysis.

221
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:46,000
Nine of those defendants had
been executed. Which is horrifying.

222
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,280
You would expect FBI hair analysis
to have a higher rate of accuracy

223
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,400
than your friends' hair analysis of:
"you can totally pull off bangs."

224
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,120
Because you can't.
You absolutely can't.

225
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,720
I couldn't. Just learn
from my mistakes, kids.

226
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,920
Save yourselves.
It's too late for me.

227
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,720
It's by no means just microscopic
hair comparison

228
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,800
which had the reliability
of its results overstated.

229
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,000
Those reports suggest there
is weak scientific support

230
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:22,360
for blood pattern, footwear,
firearm, and bite mark analysis.

231
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,240
You must be familiar with that
last one, from cool scenes like this.

232
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,160
A little 3D magic for clarity and
I give you the killer's incisors.

233
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,120
No ! The computer
rated it yellow rectangle !

234
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,320
Yellow rectangle
is the highest of match

235
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,520
a computer can give you
about teeth !

236
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,040
In the real world, bite mark
analysis is highly subjective.

237
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,080
The president's council
found the entire discipline

238
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,080
"does not meet the scientific
standards for foundational validity",

239
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,240
which I believe is science-speak
for "bullshit".

240
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,520
People have been sent to prison
on the basis of bite mark testimony

241
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,560
by experts like Dr. Michael West.

242
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,360
The science of bite marks
analysis is very accurate.

243
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,960
When it comes to bite marks,
West considers himself the maestro.

244
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,480
He's found bite marks
on a decomposed body submerged,

245
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,840
on a corpse that had been
buried for more than a year.

246
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,360
He's even used a bite mark taken out
of a bologna sandwich.

247
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,480
Impressive, matching a killer's teeth
to a bite mark in a sandwich.

248
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,520
The defendant in that case
got a new trial,

249
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,520
after an autopsy report
found that the murder victim

250
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,640
had eaten a small amount
of bologna,

251
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,640
consistent with the amount bitten
off the sandwich.

252
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,160
So that sandwich
was irrelevant to the case.

253
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,120
You could even argue that it was
actually Dr. West who was full of,

254
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,400
say it with me... shit.

255
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,120
That is not the only issue
arisen from his testimony,

256
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,720
there are now five cases where
he testified for the prosecution

257
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,720
and where the charges were dropped
or the conviction was overturned.

258
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,560
West himself admitted that
he no longer believes

259
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,600
in bite mark analysis
for identifying perpetrators

260
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,360
and he doesn't think
it should be used in court.

261
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,480
Every time a defendant
has challenged its validity,

262
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,360
the court ruled it admissible.

263
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,560
A key reason for that is that
judges often rely on precedent

264
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,880
to decide what to allow
in front of a jury.

265
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,840
If a particular discipline has
been in court before,

266
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,400
it is likely that a judge
will admit it again.

267
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,520
All of which means that
decisions about the validity of science

268
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,440
are being made by people who
don't necessarily know much about it.

269
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,080
Historically, we had a situation

270
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,960
where two scientifically illiterate
lawyers argue the bona fides

271
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,760
of scientific evidence
for a scientifically illiterate judge

272
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,360
so that 12 scientifically-illiterate
jurors could decide

273
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,000
the weight of that evidence.

274
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,720
That's absolutely terrifying.
Trials can often be a situation

275
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,320
when no one really knows
what they're doing.

276
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,040
It's like a cooking competition
for toddlers,

277
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,080
hosted by a stray cat
and judged by goats.

278
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,400
The tuna was undercooked
and covered in cold spaghetti sauce.

279
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,000
You covered the whole dish
in Honey Nut Cheerios. I loved it.

280
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,760
None of this is not to say there is not
reliable forensic science out there,

281
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,680
fingerprints and DNA
are obvious examples.

282
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,040
While we think of them as perfect,
it is important to know,

283
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,920
they are by no means infallible.

284
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,800
FBI found fingerprint analysis
could have a false-positive rate

285
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,120
as high as 1 error in 306 cases.

286
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,640
A dramatic example came after
the Madrid train bombings in 2004,

287
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,480
when the FBI arrested this
Oregon man, Brandon Mayfield.

288
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,440
He had never even been
to Spain in his life,

289
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:55,240
3 examiners matched his fingerprints
to one on a bag of detonators.

290
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,040
So he was, at that point,
completely fucked,

291
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,080
until investigators determined
that that fingerprint also matched

292
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,680
someone else, who was
in Spain at the time

293
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,520
and that blew the minds
of fingerprint experts.

294
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,160
We always assumed that fingerprints
are very unique.

295
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,680
But what the Mayfield case
demonstrates

296
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,480
is that parts of the fingerprint
can be so similar

297
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,520
that it's possible for two people to
be identified to be one latent print.

298
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,920
It turns out that two people
can have fingerprints so close

299
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,280
that even experts
can't tell them apart.

300
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,400
We are now this close to finally
proving my theory

301
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,800
that there is only
one Olsen twin.

302
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,680
She's moving fast back and forth.
She confuses your eye.

303
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,760
I don't know how this
new information helps me yet,

304
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,920
but when it does,
the end is nigh, you fraud !

305
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,200
There is DNA, which is the gold
standard in forensic science:

306
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,320
in perfect conditions, it's seen
as the most reliable form of evidence.

307
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,960
But not all DNA tests are equal

308
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,520
and crime scenes can produce
DNA of widely varying quality.

309
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,440
DNA is very fragile and easily mixed
up at a messy scene.

310
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,280
At a crime scene,

311
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,480
you may have a pool of blood
and it may not be one person's !

312
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,120
The more contributors
to that mixture of DNA,

313
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,960
the more difficult it is
to determine whose DNA it was.

314
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,360
It can be difficult to tell whose
blood is whose in a large pool,

315
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,160
which is the premise
of my new game show:

316
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,800
"So You Think You Can Tell Whose
Blood Is Whose In A Large Pool ?"

317
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,720
It premieres on Tuesday night,
and it's already been canceled.

318
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:46,120
Lower-quality DNA samples
are sometimes presented to juries

319
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,000
as if they are highly reliable.

320
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,680
In 2003, a prosecutor
in a double murder told the jury

321
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,200
that the odds the defendant's
DNA matched a glove at the scene

322
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,000
was 1 in 1.1 billion,
pretty strikingly impressive.

323
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,800
But it turned out, the glove
contained at least three people's DNA

324
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,040
and a later analysis put
the odds closer to one in two.

325
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,760
That's close enough, isn't it ?

326
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,520
People do confuse the numbers
1.1 billion and two all the time.

327
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,840
That's why I'm always saying
my favorite RnB group

328
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,720
is Boyz 1.1 Billion Men.

329
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,560
There is one more factor that
can be impossible to detect

330
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,880
and it concerns the relationship
between law enforcement

331
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,320
and the forensic labs.

332
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,600
You would hope that those labs
would work independently,

333
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,600
taking in evidence
and spitting out results.

334
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,520
But many labs work
closely with law enforcement,

335
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,520
knowing details of the case
they are working on,

336
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,640
which can prejudice their
work, even subconsciously.

337
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,760
Sometimes it's not intentional fraud,
rather something inadvertent,

338
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,480
which is the kind of bias
that can come from feeling

339
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:02,200
like you're part of a team,
you're attached to the prosecution

340
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,560
and you want to get the bad guy.

341
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,840
Yeah, but that's not their job !
They are supposed to be neutral !

342
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,880
If a referee started participating
in a team's end zone celebration,

343
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,440
you'd have some questions, like
"why have you picked a side ?"

344
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,640
and "how long have you been
practicing the Dirty Bird ?"

345
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,760
A lot needs to be fixed.
Some states have stepped up.

346
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,520
One passed a first-of-its-kind
"junk science" law,

347
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,320
which enables convicts
to request a new trial

348
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,120
if the science used
to convict them was flawed.

349
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,200
And that sounds great !
The pioneering state that did that...

350
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,480
Was Texas !
Yes, I know ! Texas !

351
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,800
Don't expect Texas to lead in science
related criminal justice reform.

352
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:57,600
But in remembering the Alamo
or naming their children "Football".

353
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,560
I love you, Football, but if you
ever forget the Alamo, we are done.

354
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,760
At the federal level,
progress has been slower.

355
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,920
Although The National Commission
on Forensic Science tried to fix that.

356
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,880
They were founded to advise
the DOJ on how to address

357
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,440
many of the problems
you have seen tonight

358
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,600
and their most recent meeting
featured remarks from Keith Harward,

359
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,280
who spent 33 years in prison for
a crime that he did not commit,

360
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,480
based on faulty bite mark
evidence.

361
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,320
Some would say,
you're a free man.

362
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,880
I will never be free of this.
There's no possibility.

363
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,280
Excuse me if I get emotional.

364
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:46,280
I spent more than half my life
in prison behind the opinions

365
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:53,240
and the expert egos
of two odontologists.

366
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,400
There's a death penalty case
in Pennsylvania that's going on now,

367
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,280
and the judge is going to allow
bite mark evidence.

368
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,880
How many people have to be
wrongly convicted

369
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,800
before they realize that
this stuff's all bogus,

370
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,640
it's all made up ?

371
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,680
That's a good question.
It's also the kind of speech

372
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,000
that could inspire that commission
to do a lot of good work.

373
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,000
Unfortunately, that was
their final meeting.

374
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,560
The commission was shut down in
April by Attorney General

375
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,960
and Xenophobic Boss Baby
Jeff Sessions.

376
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,080
That shouldn't surprise you.
Sessions is a former prosecutor,

377
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,240
and he seem like the kind
who watched "Dead Man Walking"

378
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,280
and was like: "Hurry up !
Let's kill the guy already !"

379
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,640
This movie should be called
"Dead Man Dilly-Dallying !"

380
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,560
We may be actively going
backwards on this issue,

381
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,520
which is dangerous, not only
are innocent people getting convicted,

382
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,840
guilty criminals are being left
on the streets as a result.

383
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,920
If this administration does
not see this as a problem,

384
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,320
then we should do more to educate
potential jurors

385
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,920
about some of the shortcomings
of our system.

386
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,120
One small way
to do that might be this.

387
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,640
In this city,
when the heat rises,

388
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,320
so does the murder rate.

389
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,840
Let's get
this stuff back to the lab.

390
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,680
Chief, no need.
Look what I found.

391
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,080
Bite mark, bologna sandwich.
Now, that's what I call...

392
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,880
Dead meat.

393
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,240
No ! The fuck is wrong with you ?

394
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,360
Dead meat ? This is a murder.
That's a human person.

395
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,280
That is his wife over there.

396
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,480
You're a fucking asshole.

397
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,480
He's a crime solver who
doesn't like to play by the rules.

398
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,440
I get something on these bite marks,
but it's far from conclusive.

399
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,760
There's a reasonable
degree of scientific certainty ?

400
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,760
- No. That's meaningless.
- Right.

401
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,400
And that's a problem
for everyone around him.

402
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,800
Chief ! The hair matches
the victim's wife. Case closed.

403
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,960
Slow down. Microscopic hair
comparison is bullshit science.

404
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,760
I ran a mitochondrial DNA test
on those hairs.

405
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,960
The wife did it, right ?
Case closed.

406
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,320
There were five hairs.
Three were from a coconut.

407
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,000
Two were from the wife.

408
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,560
One was from
a Cabbage Patch Kid.

409
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,200
- And the remaining one...
- The wife.

410
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,240
- This golden retriever.
- So there's our killer, chief.

411
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,040
The victim was shot.
How can a dog fire a gun ?

412
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,880
That's a bad dog right there.

413
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:49,680
And he's about to face
some... ruff justice.

414
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,760
We're indoors. Fuck you.

415
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,040
And he won't stop asking
the hard questions.

416
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,680
How 'bout, certainly reasonable
science degree-itude ?

417
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,680
- No.
- Yeah, okay.

418
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,160
He's passionate about his job,
despite not fully understanding it.

419
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,960
If we don't have something solid,
DA's gonna have my ass.

420
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,560
Why would the DA have your ass ?
We don't work for the DA.

421
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,920
- What ?
- We don't work for the DA.

422
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,680
- You do understand that, right ?
- Tell us you understand that.

423
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,240
Well, yeah !
I understand that, totally.

424
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:38,240
There's no way he understands that,
because this guy will not quit.

425
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,800
- How about a certainly...
- Just stop talking.

426
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,160
- Okay. Keep up the good work.
- Okay.

427
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,960
When his team abandons him,
he's not afraid to call for backup.

428
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,240
This better be good.

429
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,720
I brought in some expert witnesses
to help lock in this case.

430
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,760
Take a look. We got
a forensic dentist,

431
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,600
twin boy detectives, an oldtimey
prospector with a divining rod,

432
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,080
sack full of magic eight balls
and the foremost crime-sniffing pony.

433
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,160
None of this is admissible
in court.

434
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,440
Three of them testified in court
before, and they all got convictions.

435
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,280
- Is that the bologna evidence ?
- My God !

436
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,400
CSI: Crime Scene Idiot.

437
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,360
If you want or if you are able
to help relief efforts in Puerto Rico,

438
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,760
you can give here.

439
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,680
That is our show tonight.
We'll see you next week !

440
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,400
Cheers !

441
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,120
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

442
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,160
END OF EPISODE 25,
SEASON IV
