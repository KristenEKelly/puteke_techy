LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,720
SEASON IV
EPISODE 9

3
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,720
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,640
Thank you so much for joining us.
Time for a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,560
We begin with President Trump,

6
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,480
two words that give you
a sense of impending doom,

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,720
like sewage enema,
or United Airlines.

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,080
This week saw a moment when
White House spokesman Sean Spicer

9
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,000
explain our stance on Syria
by pointing to the fact

10
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,960
Assad had used chemical
weapons on his own people.

11
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,720
Not that difficult a thing to explain.
Very difficult to explain this badly.

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,680
We didn't use chemical weapons
in World War II.

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,200
You had a, you know,
someone as despicable as Hitler

14
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,280
who didn't even sink
to using chemical weapons.

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,040
Yes. "Hitler didn't use
chemical weapons."

16
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,480
That's not just wrong, that's $200
question on Jeopardy wrong.

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,280
That is Wheel of Fortune
first round tossup wrong.

18
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,720
Because everybody knows:

19
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,480
mass chemical extermination
was kind of Hitler's thing.

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,960
That and the mustache.
You take them away,

21
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,160
and all you've got is an ill-tempered
Austrian with resting bitch-face.

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,640
And Spicer's comments led to
this incredible follow-up question.

23
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,200
Please, clarify something that seems
to be gaining some traction.

24
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,320
"Hitler didn't even sink to the level
of using chemical weapons."

25
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,600
What did you mean ?

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,920
I think when you come to sarin gas,

27
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,760
he was not using the gas on his people
the same way that Assad is doing,

28
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,960
There was clearly...
I understand your point, thank you.

29
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,680
There was not... He brought them into,
to the Holocaust center, I understand.

30
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,520
At no point during that
was he in control of his own mouth,

31
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,040
specifically the moment he decided
to coin the term "Holocaust center",

32
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,240
which sounds like the home arena
for an alt-right hockey team.

33
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,040
But he wasn't done. Spicer put out
a printed statement, reading,

34
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,080
"in no way was I trying to lessen
the horrendous nature of the Holocaust"

35
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,840
which is an amazing way
to start any statement, continuing:

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,920
"I was trying to draw a contrast
of the tactic of using airplanes"

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
"to drop chemical weapons
on innocent people."

38
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,760
But that could imply
the victims of the Holocaust

39
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,960
were not innocent people.

40
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,000
Hence Spicer's hastily-released
second statement,

41
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,240
changing "innocent people"
to "population centers".

42
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,680
Then a third statement,
with an extra line:

43
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,560
"any attack on innocent people
is reprehensible and inexcusable",

44
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,640
and then a final statement,
which read in its entirety:

45
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,840
"I can't stop making statements. I don't
want to make any more statements."

46
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,120
"Can anybody hear me ?
Hitler Hitler Hitler. Sean."

47
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,800
Meanwhile, the president himself
was being interviewed about Syria,

48
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,240
where he described
in surprising detail

49
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,240
the moment he informed
Chinese President Xi Jinping

50
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,960
that the strikes
would be taking place.

51
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,160
I was at the table, we had finished
dinner, we're having dessert...

52
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,440
the most beautiful piece of
chocolate cake that you've ever seen,

53
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,480
and President Xi was enjoying it,

54
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,640
and I was given
the message from the generals

55
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,280
that the ships are locked and loaded,
what do you do ?

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And we made a determination
to do it.

57
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,720
Only Donald Trump

58
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,480
could use a conversation about
missile strikes in the Middle East

59
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,680
to advertise the cake at Mar-a-Lago.

60
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,440
Which you might want to think twice
about trying given that it was reported

61
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,240
the club's kitchen was cited
for 13 health code violations

62
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,560
for fish that had not undergone
proper parasite destruction,

63
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,760
and storing ham at 57 degrees.

64
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:25,080
Nothing says upscale dining like
lukewarm ham with a side of tapeworm.

65
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,400
If you are thinking: "Perhaps
the president brought up the cake"

66
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,360
"because he wanted to be extra-precise
about every single detail",

67
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,560
let's rejoin the interview,
just one minute later.

68
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,760
So what happens is I said, we've
launched 59 missiles heading to Iraq.

69
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,800
- Headed to Syria.
- Yes, heading toward Syria.

70
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,480
I wish she'd kept naming places,
to see if he kept agreeing with her.

71
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,480
- "Headed to Egypt."
- "Yes, headed to Egypt."

72
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,680
- "Headed to Dollywood."
- "Yes, headed to Dollywood."

73
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,320
- "Headed straight for us."
- "Yes, straight for us right now."

74
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,520
The bigger issue with Trump's
sudden bombing of Syria

75
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,680
is it runs directly counter
to everything he'd said,

76
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,840
through tweets like "what I am
saying is stay out of Syria."

77
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,560
That was just a warm-up for a week
full of foreign-policy flip-flops.

78
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,160
President Trump making
a number of stunning reversals

79
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,720
as he faces multiple
foreign policy crises.

80
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,480
After repeatedly calling NATO
obsolete on the campaign trail...

81
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,320
NATO in my opinion is obsolete.

82
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,200
Mr. Trump changing his tone.

83
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,840
I said it was obsolete.
It's no longer obsolete.

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,600
It is incredibly annoying
how long it took Donald Trump

85
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,200
to reach a conclusion
that everyone else had already reached.

86
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,800
It's like a Flat Earther
finally admitting the Earth is round.

87
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,440
"Yes, you are right,
but I'm still mad at you"

88
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,600
"that you ever believed that shit
in the first place !"

89
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,080
He also U-turned on calling China
a currency manipulator,

90
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,520
replacing Fed chair Janet Yellen,

91
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,440
and his criticisms
of the Export-Import bank.

92
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,880
And you may be happy
with those reversals.

93
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,600
But if you are a Trump supporter,
you might be rightly pissed off.

94
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,880
This is not
what you thought you bought.

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,440
It's like getting tickets
for The Vagina Monologues,

96
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,760
but on the night you went,
it starred Brian Dennehey.

97
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,160
Who's great, but it's not
really what you signed up for.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,440
And sometimes Trump's 180s
seemed to happen in real time.

99
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,160
His long-standing belief

100
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,320
that North Korea could easily
be taken care of by China

101
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,920
apparently changed moments
after he brought it up to Xi Jinping.

102
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,240
Mr. Xi then explained the history
of China and Korea, Mr. Trump said,

103
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,400
after listening for ten minutes,
he said, I realize it's not so easy.

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,720
Xi Jinping got him to completely
change his mind after ten minutes !

105
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,000
How did he explain something
that complicated in so short a time ?

106
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,120
I genuinely want to know that !
If this show did a segment on grapes,

107
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,000
we'd need 20 minutes and an
appearance from a marching band.

108
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,120
The president
seems to change his mind

109
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,600
based on any information
that is new to him,

110
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,040
which seems
to be almost any information.

111
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,640
And that is worrying. We have a leader
operating on a learner's permit.

112
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,440
And we were reminded this week of
what a president has at his disposal.

113
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,320
We learned a short time ago
for the first time in combat

114
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:32,480
the U.S. military dropped a 21 000
pound bomb in eastern Afghanistan.

115
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,120
Inside the Air Force,
inside the military,

116
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,080
it quite seriously is referred to
as the Mother Of All Bombs.

117
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,600
There is a lot to unpack there,

118
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,280
but let's take a minute
and appreciate the fact

119
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,720
that we've reached a point
where mothers can be bombs, too.

120
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,000
Hashtag Mom-Bombs,
Hashtag Feminism.

121
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,600
But minutes
after that historic bomb dropped,

122
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,080
Trump took a victory lap
that was tripped up slightly

123
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,280
by one very simple question.

124
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,320
We are so proud of our military.
And it was another successful event.

125
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,440
- Did you authorize it, sir ?
- Everybody knows what happened.

126
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,560
So, and what I do
is I authorize my military.

127
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,360
We have the greatest military
and they've done a job, as usual.

128
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,880
So, we have given them
total authorization.

129
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,520
What the fuck was that ?
That was a yes or no question,

130
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,520
to which you vomited 38 words,
none of which were "yes" or "no",

131
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,800
although none of them
were "Holocaust center" either,

132
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,880
so I guess we should be
at least partially relieved.

133
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,160
Later reports suggest that the US
commander who ordered the bomb drop

134
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,960
"didn't need and didn't request
President Trump's approval."

135
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,080
So Trump has placed
a significant amount of authority

136
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,000
in the hands of his commanders.

137
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,800
And you may think
that's good or bad.

138
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,320
But I would not expect Trump
to curb that power anytime soon.

139
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,200
As we talked about last week,
this is a man who responds to praise.

140
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,840
And yet again,
he is being praised for this.

141
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,200
Watch Trump's favorite
morning show, "Fox & Friends",

142
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,680
respond to the bombing !

143
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,560
That video is black and white.
But that is what freedom looks like.

144
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,880
One of my favorite things
in 16 years I've been at FOX News

145
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,920
is watching bombs
drop on bad guys.

146
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,440
A coincidence. One of my favorite
things in four seasons on this show

147
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,040
is getting to look into the camera
and say, "fuck you, Geraldo."

148
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,720
"I hope your mustache
gets caught in a box fan."

149
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,880
That felt amazing !
That felt absolutely amazing !

150
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,080
But Geraldo wasn't done,

151
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,120
he had strategic advice for the man
who was almost certainly watching.

152
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,080
It certainly sends a message.

153
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,880
The message has to be
we're coming for you.

154
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,960
I had a bully in high school
a guy named Richie.

155
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,440
You never knew
what Richie was gonna to do.

156
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,640
He'd have a temper,
sometimes he would want to kill you,

157
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,440
and sometimes they let you go.

158
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,840
I like they think
that Donald Trump is like Richie.

159
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,560
I want the bad guys to think
that he could do anything to them.

160
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,400
At any moment. And I think
that that has a positive impact.

161
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,560
Holy shit !

162
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,720
This is why bullying never works.
If you have a bully in school,

163
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,880
there is a good chance he's turning
some kid into the next Geraldo Rivera.

164
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,440
If you have a bully in the White House,
he does impulsive things

165
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,120
that seem to be inching us closer to
potential nuclear war with North Korea.

166
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,800
And it's gonna take an amazing piece
of chocolate cake to help us forget.

167
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,480
And now, this !

168
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,640
You put Easter and local news together,
and what do you fucking expect ?

169
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,600
We've got an Easter egg hunt
that is said to be eggcellent.

170
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,760
So you'd better hop on over
to the Lincoln Park Zoo.

171
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
A hop-pening this weekend,
one event in the Northland

172
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,640
is sure to egg-cellent
for the entire family.

173
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,080
The egg-cellent details when I see you
for Eyewitness News at 7 on WYOU.

174
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,640
That's all that it's cracked up to be.

175
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,080
They're here with their parents
getting some egg-cellent goodies.

176
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,760
Your bet your bonnet we have
a plethora of egg-citing events.

177
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,440
This Minnesota restaurant is gearing up
with this eggcellent tradition.

178
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,400
An eggcellent wildcard pick.
See what I did there ?

179
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,800
You were wondering
what's hopping here ?

180
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,080
Sounds like an egg-citing time.

181
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,080
Kids will be able to trade that in
for an egg-stra special treat.

182
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,360
- I saw what you did there.
- It was written in the script.

183
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,040
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns France,

184
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,880
home of Babar, the lovable elephant
who becomes less lovable

185
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,320
when you remember
he married his cousin.

186
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,040
Your childhood elephant hero
was a cousin-fucker.

187
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,080
Next Sunday, France holds the first
round of its presidential election.

188
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,400
If you're thinking,
"why should I care ?",

189
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,120
the truth is, it is way more important
than you might realize.

190
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,600
It's a very important election,
what's going to happen in France.

191
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,680
The future of Europe, basically.

192
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,000
France is the election that matters.

193
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,120
These French elections take place
at the crossroad of European history.

194
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,560
It's really defining Europe's fate.

195
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,480
That's right: the fate of Europe
rests in the hands of a country

196
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,720
that looks at snails and says
"I have got to get you in my mouth !"

197
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,720
But it is not an exaggeration
to say that post-Brexit,

198
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,920
and with a wave of far-right populism
sweeping Europe,

199
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,560
the fate of the EU
may hang on this election.

200
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,360
Multiple candidates
support a French Brexit,

201
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,960
and the consequences
of that would be steep.

202
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,440
Frankly, it's not bragging,
but if France is out of the EU,

203
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,280
it's the end of the EU
and the end of the Eurozone.

204
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,160
So a lot of things will depend
on the result of the French elections.

205
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,560
It's true. This could be the most
disastrous French exit in history,

206
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,080
and a "French exit" normally refers
to drinking an entire bottle of red wine

207
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,880
and then leaving the party
with the host's wife.

208
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:14,840
So, this is a critical election.
Or, technically, 2 critical elections.

209
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,800
The election takes place
in two rounds,

210
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,360
one on April the 23rd,
the next on May the 7th.

211
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,960
The first round will see
all the candidates compete for votes.

212
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,920
In the second, if nobody got more
than half the votes in the first round,

213
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,080
the top two contenders will face off.

214
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,480
What a ridiculous system !
Where are the 51 individual contests

215
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,440
that allot points based on outdated
demographic data that can result

216
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,000
in a decisive loser in the popular
vote count somehow winning ?

217
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,240
Go easy on France !

218
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,720
They're still working out
the kinks in their democracy.

219
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,080
And this election comes
at a time of great volatility.

220
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,280
France has suffered a string
of major terror attacks,

221
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,040
their unemployment rate
is around 10 percent,

222
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,680
and their president, Francois Hollande,
isn't running, for a pretty good reason.

223
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,160
The latest opinion polls have come out.
Francois Hollande is at an alltime low.

224
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,040
He even got close to zero here !

225
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,880
Get ready: according to this poll,
only four percent of French people

226
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,800
are satisfied
by Francois Hollande's presidency.

227
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,000
Four percent !
To put that in perspective:

228
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,760
apparently, the very lowest album
score in Metacritic's history

229
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,480
is 15 percent for Kevin Federline's
"Playing with Fire",

230
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,160
an album
about which Billboard raved,

231
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,760
"in general,
Federline enunciates well."

232
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,000
Even without Hollande running,
his Party is divided and struggling,

233
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,200
with one early contender
to replace him, Manuel Valls,

234
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,560
so widely disliked,
that this happened.

235
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,440
It happened an hour ago
in this cafe behind me, Café Broy,

236
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,640
well known
to Strasbourg residents.

237
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,720
A man approached Manuel Valls
and threw flour at him.

238
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,960
Anywhere else, it might be a bad sign
to have flour thrown at you,

239
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,640
but in a country where pastries
have greater rights than people,

240
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,320
it is possible
that that was an honor.

241
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,040
So, who is running for
this important job ?

242
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,000
There are actually
11 candidates at the moment.

243
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,720
We'll get to the main ones,

244
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,280
but first, you are going to want
to meet some of the outsiders.

245
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,600
Jacques Cheminade,
a conspiracy theorist who once said

246
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,720
that the Queen of England was involved
in international drug trafficking,

247
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,680
and whose platform includes
a plan to colonize Mars,

248
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,760
which he explained magnificently.

249
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,840
Today we don't have
an actual space policy.

250
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,760
We drag rickety obsolete objects
like the old Star Wars rocket.

251
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,000
So it works out in Star Wars
with the weird bear

252
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,400
and Larry Skywalker,
but it doesn't work in real life.

253
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,520
Yes, he said "Larry Skywalker"
and "that weird bear",

254
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,000
presumably meaning Chewbacca.

255
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,760
I think that should've been
those characters' names instead.

256
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,320
"Hi, I'm Han Solo, this is Larry,
and this is our friend,"

257
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,720
"that weird bear or whatever
the fuck he is, I don't know."

258
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,000
Then, there is Jean Lasalle,

259
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,200
who, as you can see,
is almost offensively French.

260
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,160
He once went
on a 39-day hunger strike

261
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,000
to protest a threat
to jobs in his constituency,

262
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,280
and his campaign ads
are mesmerizing.

263
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,280
He rides on a train in moody black
and white, works on his farm,

264
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,320
dances around,
and then mows a hillside shirtless.

265
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,640
His entire life seems like an attempt
to win the game show called:

266
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,480
"So You Think You Can France."

267
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,760
But the thing is there, there are
currently four main candidates

268
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,440
with a real shot
at getting to the second round.

269
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,800
There is Francois Fillon,
the former French prime minister.

270
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,880
He was leading,
but has since fallen back in the polls,

271
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,000
thanks to "Penelopegate",
which sounds like a scandal

272
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,480
involving selling weapons-grade uranium
to Penelope Cruz,

273
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,560
but it involves Fillon allegedly
paying his wife Penelope and children

274
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,520
hundreds of thousands of euros
of public money, for little or no work.

275
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,280
The accusations don't stop !

276
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,640
There are reports he may have
breached electoral rules

277
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,240
after receiving a donation of 2 suits
that together cost 13 000 euros.

278
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,920
I am allowed to be given a suit
by a friend. It's not against the law.

279
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,400
That is a completely normal thing
for adult friends to do.

280
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,720
"Happy birthday ! I got you two suits
that cost about 7 000 dollars each."

281
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,720
"That is a non-suspicious amount
to spend on a gift for a friend."

282
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,280
"How not weird is this ?
Couldn't be not weirder, right ?"

283
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,920
So the French public
turned on Fillon

284
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,160
and you will never guess
how they expressed their anger.

285
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,000
Moments before he took the stage
at a rally,

286
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,280
you'll see he was hit in the face
with some flour.

287
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,960
We can see images
of that happening right there now.

288
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,760
Apparently he had a spare suit,
luckily for him.

289
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,000
It just doesn't look great
to whip out a brand new suit

290
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,000
when you've been essentially accused
of having been bribed in suits.

291
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,280
Maybe go for a tshirt
and shorts there.

292
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,280
Next, there is far-left candidate
Jean-Luc Mélenchon,

293
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,320
who is anti-EU,
and pro-high-tech campaign wizardry.

294
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,560
Answering the eternal question
of how to be in two places at once,

295
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,320
Jean-Luc Melenchon
has embraced holograms.

296
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,840
Where am I ? In Lyon.

297
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,320
And now: in Paris !

298
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,040
Cool. That was both very lame
and very costly.

299
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,280
Like finding out your uncle's
"detachable thumb" trick

300
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,280
cost him $400 000.

301
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,040
That brings us
to the two current frontrunners.

302
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,160
Let's deal with Emmanuel Macron.
Polls suggest that he is the favorite,

303
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,360
which is impressive, considering
he's never held elected office before.

304
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,200
He's a former banker who served
as an economic adviser to Hollande.

305
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,440
If you are falling asleep listening
to me describe him, you're not alone.

306
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,960
Mr. Macron
who is neither left nor right

307
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,160
and is generally inoffensive
to the entire population

308
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,320
is not super attractive to anyone.

309
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,280
He is generally inoffensive
and not super attractive to anyone.

310
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,400
Like the guy who played the main
character on "How I Met Your Mother."

311
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,680
This man, and this is true,
has no name.

312
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,360
Macron has a centrist policy
that is pro-business, pro-Europe,

313
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,760
and aimed
at boosting France's economy.

314
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,880
But the most interesting thing
about him might be this.

315
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,640
Emmanuel Macron was once
a small town boy from Amiens

316
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,480
who met his future wife
here at school.

317
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,600
The only twist
is that she was his teacher.

318
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,240
It's true !
He married his French teacher,

319
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,960
who is 20 years older than him,
and as a result,

320
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,280
Macron, a 39-year-old man,
now has seven stepgrandchildren.

321
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,880
Sorry, but a man in his 30s ending up
with seven step-grandchildren

322
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,920
sounds like the plot of a direct-to-DVD
Ashton Kutcher movie called

323
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,240
"Even on a nine-hour flight
this movie is unwatchable."

324
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,960
If you're wondering:

325
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,200
"did Macron get any baking ingredient
thrown at him during the campaign ?"

326
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,440
What do you think ?

327
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,400
Emmanuel Macron just got hit
in the head with an egg.

328
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,560
So, to recap: that is two cups
of flour and now an egg.

329
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,520
I don't know if the French people
are any closer to picking a president,

330
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,560
but they're about halfway
to making a decent crepe.

331
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,640
And that leaves us
with Marine Le Pen...

332
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,280
Macron's biggest challenger,
and honestly,

333
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,840
she is the main reason you should
be invested in this election.

334
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,680
The Le Pen name
carries a lot of baggage in France.

335
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,920
Her father was Jean-Marie Le Pen,

336
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,600
who co-founded her party,
the National Front.

337
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,080
And he is a deeply unpleasant
human being.

338
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,680
Jean-Marie Le Pen famously
dismissed the Nazi gas chambers

339
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,120
as a mere "detail" of history,

340
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,520
and courts have repeatedly found him
guilty of questioning the Holocaust.

341
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,400
That's a taster.
He also said of one Jewish critic,

342
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,920
"we'll put a batch in the oven
next time".

343
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,280
Which is the kind of vile,
horrific anti-Semitism

344
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,640
that gets most people
permanently banished from society,

345
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,240
as well as an Oscar nomination
for directing "Hacksaw Ridge."

346
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,920
Now, Marine Le Pen actually
kicked her father out of the party,

347
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,880
and has worked hard to rehabilitate
the National Front's reputation

348
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,560
and present a softer image.

349
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,920
And to listen to one French voter,
it seems to have worked.

350
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,400
Why vote Front National ?
It's simple. It's Marine Le Pen.

351
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,480
If it were her father, it would be no,
because he's a crazy old man.

352
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,920
There were skinheads,
thugs, and fascists in the party.

353
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,040
With Marine it's not like that.
There's elegance, a bit of restraint.

354
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,360
Yeah, but elegant presentation
does not negate poisonous content.

355
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,480
A klansman is a klansman even if you
slap a monocle and a top hat on him,

356
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,880
and give him a cane.

357
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,440
Wait, hang on.
Take off the sheet.

358
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,960
I fucking knew it !

359
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,960
You're a monster, Peanut,
you're a monster.

360
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,280
Now, the point is...

361
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,520
Le Pen is particularly popular
among young people in France,

362
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,760
who have a high rate of unemployment,
and have responded to her promises

363
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,000
to give them jobs and to encourage
a "national preference" in employment,

364
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,600
making it more expensive
for businesses to hire non-citizens.

365
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,440
But beneath her slick presentation,
Le Pen's message is vicious.

366
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,120
She was asked
about immigrants in France,

367
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,640
and while her answer started well,
it quickly deteriorated.

368
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,360
I'm a very tolerant
and hospitable person, like you.

369
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,760
Would you accept 12 illegal
immigrants moving into your flat ?

370
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,600
You wouldn't ! On top of that,
they start to remove the wallpaper !

371
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,640
Some of them would steal your
wallet and brutalize your wife.

372
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,800
Brutalizing your wife
and stealing your wallet,

373
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,200
I get, that's just boilerplate racism.

374
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,920
But "people are coming
to take my wallpaper"

375
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,360
is something a crazy person says.

376
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,880
No one wants your wallpaper,
you catastrophically weird person.

377
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,080
While France
is a proudly secular society,

378
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,360
some of Le Pen's proposals
would take that to the extreme.

379
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,480
Should Muslim people
be allowed to wear headscarves ?

380
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,480
I'm opposed to wearing headscarves
in public places. That's not France.

381
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,840
Not just headscarves. Le Pen says
she would ban yarmulkes in public,

382
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,640
any conspicuous symbol
of religious belief.

383
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,040
Would a Sikh person
allowed to be wear a turban ?

384
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,080
No, not in public. We don't have
a lot of Sikhs in France.

385
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,000
We've got some, but we don't hear
much from them or about them,

386
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,200
which is good news.

387
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,000
Is it ?

388
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,600
That is such a reprehensible thing
to say about people you hope to govern.

389
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,840
I never thought I'd say this.
It doesn't make sense:

390
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,160
I hope someone
steals your wallpaper.

391
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,600
I don't know why they would Marine,
but I hope they do.

392
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,320
The truth here is though,
whatever the result of this election,

393
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,440
Le Pen has dangerously
normalized the National Front,

394
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,040
winning seats at the local level,
and a few in the legislature.

395
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,120
Frustrating about watching
this unfold from America

396
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,480
is this feels a little like deja vu:
a potentially destabilizing populist,

397
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,640
campaigning on anti-immigrant rhetoric,
who rages against the elites,

398
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,880
despite having a powerful father
and inherited wealth,

399
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,360
even as the experts reassure us
there is no way that this can happen.

400
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,120
The truth is she's not going to win.

401
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,680
In the second round,
everybody will unite against her.

402
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,960
I would think that most people,
doesn't matter which political color,

403
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,400
will vote for Macron
to block the way to Marine Le Pen.

404
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,360
She will not win. We will not have
in France another Trump election.

405
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,680
She is not named Donald Le Pen.

406
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,600
She is Marine Le Pen.
She will not be elected.

407
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,520
It's the kind
of reckless overconfidence

408
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,160
you normally only see in a
period-piece movie about a tragedy.

409
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,440
"The Hindenburg is the safest
form of travel there is !"

410
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,440
"I'd like to see static electricity try
to set this ship on fire, I tells ya !"

411
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,240
But I would not be so confident,
especially because,

412
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,240
while turnout in French presidential
elections is around 80 percent,

413
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,600
polls show that around 1/3 of French
voters might choose to abstain.

414
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,720
If they do that in the second round,
Le Pen's very motivated voters

415
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,920
could put her in office and that
could be bad for a lot of people.

416
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,280
I would like to try and convince you,
France, not to sit this election out.

417
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,200
To do that, let me appeal to your
innate French sense of superiority

418
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,080
over the U.S. and Britain.

419
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,800
Which is, and it pains to admit this,
not entirely misplaced.

420
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,000
Real French croissants
are buttery pillows of perfection,

421
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,960
whereas the American "croissanwich"
is an ungodly abomination.

422
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,360
Your French wines are magnificent
certainly superior to British wines,

423
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,840
which taste like Michael Caine
urinated in some grape juice.

424
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,800
You love acting like you are better
than Britain and America.

425
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,520
Now is your chance to prove that.

426
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,040
Because we made populist,
nativist choices with Brexit and Trump,

427
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,640
and to be honest, it's not working out
so great for us so far.

428
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,560
And now, you have a populist,
nativist choice of your own.

429
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,080
And just imagine
how superior you can feel

430
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,840
if you don't make
the same mistake that we did.

431
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:54,280
I want to convince you more, but I know
you don't like big, gaudy gestures.

432
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,000
Let me convince you in the elegant,
restrained manner that you prefer.

433
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,160
Please !

434
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,840
Please join me, France,
at a cozy bistro.

435
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,600
Join me at this bistro

436
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,000
and let us drink wine,
listen to accordion music,

437
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,240
and smoke into each other's faces.

438
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,240
Hello, France !

439
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:32,240
I know a British man speaking
on an American television show

440
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,560
about the Republic of France
is basically French kryptonite.

441
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,440
That's why I'm speaking French
to you right now,

442
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,240
even though I know
I'm making your elegant language

443
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,040
sound like a Guy Ritchie
remake of "Amelie".

444
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:56,960
But please, listen:
Britain and America are fucked up.

445
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,320
Don't fuck up, too.

446
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,880
Marine Le Pen is,
how do you say in French ?

447
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,920
A demagogic asshole.

448
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,400
A monstrous, demagogic asshole.
You're better than this.

449
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,200
This is your chance to live up

450
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,280
to the French philosophy
of the Enlightenment,

451
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,680
to show the whole world
that the French ideals

452
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:28,760
of liberty, equality, and fraternity
go together like...

453
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:38,480
Larry Skywalker
and, of course, that weird bear.

454
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,720
Help us, France,
you're our only hope.

455
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,240
That's our show,
see you next week.

456
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,600
Good night, my love !

457
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,080
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

458
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,080
END OF EPISODE 9,
SEASON IV
