LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,080
Season IV
Episode 7

3
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,080
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,680
Thank you for joining us.
A quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,240
We begin with the investigation
of Donald Trump and Russia,

6
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,680
a scandal we've been referring
to as "Stupid Watergate",

7
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,680
it has all the potential
consequences of Watergate

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,120
but everyone involved
is stupid.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,800
The news centered
on Congressman Devin Nunes,

10
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,000
the most Devin Devin
in the history of Devins.

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,480
His parents wanted
something else,

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,320
but the birth certificate
wrote "Devin" on itself.

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,000
Last week he made headlines
with a seemingly huge claim.

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,240
Devin Nunes
dropped a bombshell today.

15
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,840
He said Trump's transition team and
president's personal communications

16
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,320
may have been caught up in,
quote, incidental surveillance.

17
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,920
That sounded like it could
back up Trump's claims

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
that Obama wiretapped him,
but it unraveled,

19
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,920
as Nunes conceded
the surveillance was routine,

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,840
appeared to be legal,
occurred after the election

21
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,000
and may not have targeted
Trump or his transition team,

22
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,840
but rather foreign individuals
discussing the transition.

23
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,880
Trump claimed the evidence left him
feeling "somewhat vindicated".

24
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,040
Trump feels vindicated
by dubious sources all the time.

25
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,400
We don't need to invest
in clean energy.

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,320
It says on this cup that
"America Runs On Dunkin'".

27
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,400
There were many questions
surrounding Nunes,

28
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,360
who looks like the guy a 13-year-old
wishes her mom would stop dating.

29
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,120
Why did he raced to the White House
to share his information with Trump ?

30
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,760
Especially in the light
of this revelation.

31
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,160
New York Times reported White House
officials were the source of reports

32
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,800
given to House intelligence chair
Devin Nunes.

33
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,600
Devin took what appears to be
an unnecessary trip

34
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,120
to tell what appears to be
unimportant news

35
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,040
to what may have been
the source of the news itself.

36
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,720
What Nunes brought to light
has turned out to be smoke and mirrors

37
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,520
as convoluted as it is pointless,
the "Now You See Me" of revelations.

38
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,240
Stupid Watergate found a way
to get even stupider:

39
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,840
the surveillance Nunes studied
concerned Trump's team,

40
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,400
of which one member was
Devin fucking Nunes.

41
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,800
Which seems like
a conflict of interest.

42
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,480
It was important for Republicans
to make clear

43
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,080
how independent he is
from the White House.

44
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,560
They couldn't do that properly.

45
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,120
Keep in mind who he works for.
He answers to the president.

46
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,280
- Or for constituents of his district ?
- You do both.

47
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,360
No !
You absolutely do not !

48
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,480
You do one of them
and explicitly not the other.

49
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,320
That's the whole point of Congress.

50
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,480
That is why this
story is Stupid Watergate:

51
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,000
it could take down the government,
nobody involved understands why

52
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,200
or how to cover it up or what
the government fucking is,

53
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,800
or possibly how to breathe without
getting regular reminders.

54
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,000
So for now, let's move on
to the United Kingdom:

55
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,600
whose most beloved children's book
is about a child who thinks

56
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,280
a bear with an eating disorder
and a depressed donkey talk to him.

57
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,000
It has been almost a year since
the UK voted to leave EU.

58
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,480
The process of doing that
began Wednesday.

59
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,600
In accordance with
the wishes of the British people,

60
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,000
the UK is leaving the EU.

61
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,880
This is an historic moment from
which there can be no turning back.

62
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,520
The electricity
in that room is palpable.

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,920
Even her phrasing is ominous:

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,400
"a historic moment from which
there can be no turning back"

65
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,480
could apply to getting
a Limp Bizkit tattoo

66
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,600
or the moment after your
cult drank their suicide potions.

67
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,760
The UK has now initiated
Article 50 of the EU treaty,

68
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,480
triggering a two-year
negotiating process,

69
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,040
leading up to a withdrawal
from the EU in March of 2019.

70
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,000
We're facing 24 months
of promising to pull out,

71
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,240
or as Sting calls it,
a one night stand.

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,120
This process was initiated
by delivering a letter

73
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,560
to the president
of the European Council,

74
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,760
which began:
"Dear President Tusk."

75
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,800
Which should be the start of a letter
you write to a walrus president,

76
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,520
but it was a breakup letter to
an actual person named Donald Tusk,

77
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,920
who seemed
understandably devastated.

78
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,280
There's no reason to pretend
that this is a happy day,

79
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,520
neither in Brussels
nor in London.

80
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,240
What can I add to this ?
We already miss you.

81
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,600
Thank you and goodbye.

82
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,360
Come on, Tuskie !
Don't be sad !

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,560
If it helps, you will get over Britain.
If you ever find yourself missing it,

84
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,800
stare at this picture of an angry
old woman in a racist t-shirt

85
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,480
eating beans on toast in the rain,
that is what you are leaving behind.

86
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,080
Although, not everybody was
gloomy about the news this week.

87
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,760
Take Nigel Farage,
former UKIP leader

88
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,080
and current spokesmodel
for Smug Dickhead moisturizer,

89
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,240
the moisturizer that gives you
that smug dickhead glow.

90
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,360
He was absolutely thrilled.

91
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,560
Today's the day,
after 25 years of campaigning,

92
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,800
that the impossible dream
came true, I'm delighted.

93
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,560
That is horrible. Because every time
one of Farage's dreams come true,

94
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,480
somewhere in the world,
an angel gets diarrhea.

95
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:09,920
Never mind leaving, it is going to be
hard for UK to keep itself together.

96
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,400
This vote divided
the British public.

97
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:18,440
BBC illustrated this division with
a not entirely dignified visual aid.

98
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,600
How does our jury feel
about triggering Article 50 ?

99
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,120
We gave them emoji paddles: happy,
unhappy, or worried and confused.

100
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,440
Please vote now.

101
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,320
Four happy, three worried,
one unhappy.

102
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,640
Our jury and Britain is divided on its
reaction to triggering of Article 50.

103
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,760
I know that looks stupid, but
British are so emotionally repressed,

104
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,640
emojis are the best way to get
a coherent sentiment out of us.

105
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,400
It's pretty much that
or baking competitions.

106
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,200
Let this Victorian sponge cake
say what I never can.

107
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,480
I'm collapsing inside.

108
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,920
And with that in mind,
I'm really struggling to find the words

109
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,280
for how difficult and depressing
the next years will be.

110
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,560
So if I may try in emoji form:
Europe is feeling Crying Kitty Cat,

111
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,920
while Nigel Farage has a full,
throbbing Eggplant.

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,200
I am hovering between
Crying Face and Handgun,

113
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,080
because it seems our best-case
scenario is to just Pray emoji

114
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,240
that this does not turn
into a Flaming Pile of Shit.

115
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,200
And now, this.

116
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,640
Another look at the awkward
sex talk on CBS This Morning.

117
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,920
If I pinched your butt,
would you call the police ?

118
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,040
The answer is no.
I'll answer for you, Mr. Rose.

119
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,360
Would you pinch my butt,
is the question.

120
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,720
- We're pro-love.
- Pro-love, yes we are.

121
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,840
- The news is back and so is love.
- Love and sex are here.

122
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,280
You just went there.

123
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,600
You should see what I'm wearing
underneath this dress.

124
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,800
You should see what Charlie
wears underneath his shirt.

125
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,320
- It's getting hot in here ?
- Norah knows.

126
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,960
Ain't nothing shrinking
about Charlie Rose.

127
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,320
Brain ain't shrinking. I can tell
you something else, but I'm not.

128
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,120
You want me to just be
around you more ?

129
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,520
- I can do that.
- I could get more done.

130
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,680
I love you.

131
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,840
What time should Gayle
and I come over tonight ?

132
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,640
Do you want us to bring anything
or will dinner be served ?

133
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,120
You remember the answer last year ?
It was bring your sister !

134
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,680
You need to go on a boat
with Mr. Charlie Rose.

135
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,680
- I'm game.
- Me, too.

136
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,920
This is why I'm the luckiest man
in the world, right here.

137
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,360
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns marijuana.

138
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,360
Basically,
catnip for people.

139
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,960
It has gained increasing
acceptance in recent years.

140
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,640
One bright spot on Election Night
was pro-marijuana referenda

141
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,240
passing in eight states.

142
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,880
It's official !

143
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,640
A big win for lovers of weed.

144
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,560
We are really excited. This is a huge
victory, not just for Californians,

145
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,600
but for the country
and the world.

146
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,840
Everybody here
should be excited.

147
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,280
It's weird that those celebrations

148
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,080
happened the same night
that Trump was elected.

149
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,160
It's like celebrating
your baseball team winning

150
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,120
on the deck
of the sinking Titanic.

151
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,880
Bit of a mixed bag today,
but still: go Sox, Yankees suck !

152
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,440
44 states now have some form
of medical marijuana law,

153
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,840
and eight have laws
allowing recreational use.

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,280
The War on Drugs was futile,
expensive,

155
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,600
and imposed harsh penalties
on African-Americans,

156
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,680
who police data suggest are over
four times more likely

157
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,120
to be arrested
for marijuana possession.

158
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,800
White people are a million times more
likely to be shocked by that statistic.

159
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,800
And this is clearly
no longer a fringe issue.

160
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,160
In 1969, a Gallup poll showed
12 percent favored legalization.

161
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,240
Today it's 60 percent.

162
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,920
Marijuana is something we've just
all gradually decided is okay.

163
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,680
Like Mark Wahlberg
as a serious actor.

164
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,560
You know what... sure.
I've decided I'm fine with that.

165
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,520
But the legality of marijuana
is more fraught than you may think.

166
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,800
If you have marijuana now,

167
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,080
even if you are acting legally
according to your state,

168
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,320
you may still be
in serious jeopardy.

169
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,560
And that's not your
weed-induced paranoia talking.

170
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,560
You could lose your home,
job or possessions, Greg.

171
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,920
I'm freaking the shit out of
any stoned viewer named Greg.

172
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,120
That is not a bad thing, this story
is worth worrying about.

173
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,720
Let's begin with going back to why
marijuana is so heavily regulated.

174
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,360
It was legal at the start
of the 20th century,

175
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,560
but anti-drug hysteria, fueled by
racist stereotypes about who used it,

176
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,640
led to it being gradually
outlawed around the country.

177
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,560
It was Richard Nixon, the Mozart
of racially motivated lawmaking,

178
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,240
who targeted it
in his War on Drugs,

179
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,640
for reasons that he was open about,
in conversations he recorded.

180
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,720
Every one of the bastards that are out
for legalizing marijuana is Jewish.

181
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,200
What is the matter with the Jews,
Bob, what is the matter with them ?

182
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,720
I suppose because
most of them are psychiatrists,

183
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,280
all the greatest
psychiatrists are Jewish.

184
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,920
By God we are going to hit
the marijuana thing

185
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,880
and I want to hit it
right square in the puss.

186
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,320
Yes. Quick historical footnote:
you know who he's talking to there ?

187
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,920
Billy Bush. Yeah. Turns out
people open up to that guy !

188
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,120
Always have.

189
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,360
Nixon signed the Controlled
Substances Act in 1970

190
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,920
and it's still in effect.

191
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,920
Marijuana is classified
as a Schedule I drug,

192
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,880
the highest classification
alongside heroin.

193
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,320
Schedule II, a step down, features
cocaine and methamphetamine.

194
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,040
Marijuana is not a Schedule I

195
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,800
any more than a hedgehog
is an apex predator.

196
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,520
You're not scaring anyone, Rolland.
Get a tattoo.

197
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,080
But that federal law is constantly
clashing with new state laws.

198
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,880
Legal marijuana businesses have
struggled to get bank accounts,

199
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,120
because at the federal level, they
are still seen as criminal enterprises.

200
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,280
If banks took their deposits, that
could be considered money laundering.

201
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,000
This meant that businesses
operate all-cash.

202
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,560
100 percent of our revenues
come in cash.

203
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,000
This is federal taxes
that we pay in cash.

204
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,040
When we pay all 12 employees,
they're getting envelopes of cash.

205
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,880
These are state taxes.

206
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,800
That is a shitty way
to be forced to do business.

207
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,240
On the suspicious scale,
"cash-stuffed envelopes" rank

208
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,880
somewhere between "unfurled
hundreds dusted in white powder"

209
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,040
and "a wad of damp ones containing
a single pubic hair".

210
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,640
If you are wondering why he was
talking about paying his taxes,

211
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,120
yeah, under federal tax law,
you must declare income

212
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
even if the source of it is illegal.

213
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,560
The tax code
even has provisions like:

214
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,520
"if you receive a bribe,
include it in your income"

215
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,160
and "if you steal property, you
must report its fair market value".

216
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,880
Which seems such
an obvious trap to catch criminals,

217
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,360
it should really be listed
on the form as:

218
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,960
"This is a trap.
Are you really this stupid ?"

219
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,720
"You're filling out a federal
form admitting guilt, you idiot."

220
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,880
Marijuana businesses have all the tax
liabilities of other businesses,

221
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,560
but what they don't get
is one major advantage.

222
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,960
The agency bars them from making
most normal business deductions.

223
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,440
You could end up with
a tax bill far more than

224
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,360
any potential profit
you could ever make.

225
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,040
You can't deduct
certain expenses.

226
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,040
And that can mean that you pay
double the amount of tax

227
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,080
that you would if you were
selling any other product.

228
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,680
That means the shop where
you bought your weed

229
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,160
might pay double
the amount paid by the shop

230
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,640
where you ordered
that shitty pizza, Greg.

231
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,560
I'm talking to you again, Greg.
This was important. Pay attention !

232
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,720
It is not just businesses facing
difficulties. It's customers, too.

233
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,600
Look at Brandon Coats, paralyzed from
a car accident as a teenager.

234
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,440
He had a prescription
for medical marijuana,

235
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,120
but he was fired from his job
after he failed a drug test.

236
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,920
What was it like for you
when they said:

237
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,280
"we don't want you to work
here anymore" ?

238
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,800
It was devastating. It's hard enough
for somebody like me to get a job.

239
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,600
People probably don't think
that I can do what I can.

240
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,760
Did you think, because you had
a medical marijuana card,

241
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,360
that you had license
to go ahead and use it ?

242
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,720
I was under the impression

243
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,000
that we had passed a law
and that we had made it legal.

244
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,080
It's understandable he thought
he was doing nothing wrong.

245
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,000
The state had given him a license
to use medical marijuana legally,

246
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,760
and yet he got fired anyway.

247
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,040
Couldn't turn to the Americans
with Disabilities Act, a federal law,

248
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,560
and it doesn't protect marijuana use,
all of which is frustrating.

249
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,200
That's like driving
exactly the speed limit

250
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,080
and getting pulled over
by a cop:

251
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,600
Sorry, the federal
speed limit is three

252
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,440
and the legal age to drive is 62
and also you have to be drunk.

253
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,040
Surprise !
You're fucking under arrest now.

254
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,960
Even if you are only dealing with
your government at the state level,

255
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,520
decades of enforcing anti-drug laws
can result in officials making mistakes

256
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,120
as two Michigan parents,

257
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,600
one who treated his epileptic seizures
with marijuana, discovered in 2013.

258
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,800
Steve and Maria Green
watched as their infant daughter

259
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,480
was taken from their care.

260
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,840
The state-sanctioned medical
marijuana users' home

261
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,080
was too dangerous
because of the plants inside.

262
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,840
It would place our residence
at a higher rate of armed robbery

263
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,720
and therefore was an imminent
danger for my child to be removed.

264
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,880
That is absurd.

265
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,200
If you have valuable items in your
home, we might take your children.

266
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,040
That is gonna add some excitement
to "The Price Is Right" from now.

267
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,120
I want that entertainment
center, but I love my kids.

268
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,040
Sorry Tommy, Daddy's going
for the plasma screen !

269
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,640
It's a dream, son,
a dream of mine !

270
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,520
Some will say:

271
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,000
"the medical efficacy of marijuana
needs a lot more study".

272
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,240
And that is true. The problem is,
it's very difficult to do that,

273
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,360
because federal laws
are standing in the way.

274
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,080
To study marijuana, you need approval
from three different federal agencies,

275
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,480
which can take years.

276
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,320
One scientist was forced
to wait six years

277
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,360
to begin studying its effects on
PTSD, which is a long time.

278
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,960
I wouldn't blame her
if she'd just said:

279
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,280
I'm studying "does chocolate during sex
help red wine make you lose weight ?"

280
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,240
At least that way I'll get
to go on 'The Today Show !

281
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,440
If you are conducting a federally
approved study on marijuana,

282
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,840
you can only get it from one place.

283
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,120
Dr. Mahmoud Elsohly oversees

284
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,200
the University of Mississippi's
marijuana project.

285
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,200
Its mission: to aid law enforcement
and produce pot for federal study,

286
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,960
mostly related to addiction.

287
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,160
You're the government's
sole producer of marijuana.

288
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,200
It's true. The sole source of
government-sanctioned marijuana

289
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,320
is that guy,
at the University of Mississippi.

290
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,480
Update your stereotypes about
the University of Mississippi,

291
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,320
which I believe is the official slogan
of the University of Mississippi.

292
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,000
While researchers wait for marijuana
to study whether it helps with PTSD,

293
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,240
plenty of veterans will
tell you: it does.

294
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,000
Danny Belcher, a Vietnam vet
who'd been prescribed

295
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,160
medication
for pain and depression,

296
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,000
but, as he told
the Kentucky legislature in 2014,

297
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,800
he found that when he tried marijuana,
it started really helping him.

298
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,080
I do have my bowl
of pot in my house,

299
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,080
and if I wake up at night,
had a nightmare,

300
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,080
when I'm ringing wet
with sweat...

301
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,000
And I see Kramer, his dead body.
Rodriguez, his dead body.

302
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,520
If that nightmare gets so bad
I can't wake up

303
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,520
and realize it's just a nightmare,
I will light that pipe up,

304
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,800
I'll be a criminal,
I'll go back to sleep.

305
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,600
My next morning, I will
get up at 6 o'clock like I always do,

306
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,120
my four days a week
I go to the gym, I run.

307
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,960
I help other veterans.

308
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,640
I couldn't do that if I was on
the drugs VA had me on.

309
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,760
So for all the talk you hear of
marijuana being a "gateway drug",

310
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,480
in his case, that gateway
led to peaceful sleep,

311
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,960
rigorous exercise
and community service.

312
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,280
Pretty nice fucking gate,
it turns out.

313
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,000
Nice one to walk through
if you get the chance.

314
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,000
You may've noticed he said
he's acting like a criminal.

315
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,360
Which is a little odd, because
Kentucky has a medical marijuana law.

316
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,320
But the shortcomings of that law
touch on many of the reasons

317
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,120
why "legal marijuana" can
be a bit of a grey area.

318
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,640
Kentucky's law only applies
to one marijuana product,

319
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,760
and it requires a "written order"
or a prescription.

320
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,160
That is a real problem,
because under federal law,

321
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,440
it is technically illegal for a doctor
to write you a prescription.

322
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,680
So most states,
they get around that

323
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,840
by calling for a recommendation
or a certification doctors give you.

324
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,920
But even if Kentucky's law did that,
if Danny went to his doctors,

325
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
they couldn't give him anything,
because they're a federal hospital.

326
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,280
Federal policy prohibits VA doctors
from even recommending marijuana,

327
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,720
regardless of the state law
and of their medical opinion.

328
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,520
Which again,
is a bit weird.

329
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,200
A doctor shouldn't be ignored
because he recommends marijuana,

330
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,320
but because he is televised.

331
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,400
We all agree on that.
We're on the same page on that one.

332
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,840
It gets worse. Even if
Danny had a private doctor

333
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,560
and Kentucky rewrote its law,
where would he get marijuana from ?

334
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,680
Kentucky's law also neglected

335
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,840
to set up any system for
legal marijuana distribution.

336
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,320
He'd have to obtain it
from somewhere else.

337
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,680
But where would he do that ?
And how ?

338
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,120
He could have it shipped, right ?
That would be a federal crime.

339
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,560
What if he flew to a state
where marijuana is legal

340
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,320
and brought it to Kentucky ?

341
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,000
No, again.
That is also a federal crime.

342
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,560
Could he drive to a neighboring state
to get what he needs ?

343
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,480
No, two of those states have
prohibitions on marijuana

344
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,120
and the rest don't currently
recognize out-of-state patients.

345
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,160
If you are thinking,
could he train a carrier pigeon

346
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,080
to carry the pot from Colorado ?

347
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,160
Yes, that's a good idea
and "cool bird" stamp.

348
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,760
But as a practical
matter there, no.

349
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,640
Because it's illegal
and because you know

350
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,000
the bird will eat it on the way,
stop flying, and spend the night

351
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,640
giggling about how owls seem
like they have glasses but, like,

352
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,120
don't have glasses.

353
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,280
And that's crazy, right ?

354
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,320
They don't know,
but it's there right ?

355
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,920
If you live in Kentucky,
despite there being a law

356
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,360
that gives access
to medical marijuana,

357
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,160
there's virtually no legal way
for you to get it.

358
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,920
Things improved toward
the end of the Obama administration,

359
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,240
because his general attitude
was this.

360
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:43,360
We have federal laws that classify
marijuana as a illegal substance,

361
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:50,080
but we're not gonna spend
resources trying to turn back

362
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,880
decisions that have been made
at the state level.

363
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,480
His attitude to pot was:

364
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,040
"I'm not gonna hassle you over
this, unless you make me."

365
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,880
The same policy as a security guard
at a Dave Matthews concert.

366
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,280
And his administration issued
guidelines in that spirit.

367
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,600
By the end of his term, it was easier
to study marijuana

368
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,080
and for dispensaries
to get bank accounts.

369
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,080
Those guidelines weren't permanent.
And that could be a real problem.

370
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,040
Because our new attorney general
is Jeff Sessions,

371
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,520
the concept of golf
expressed in man-form,

372
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,240
and he has been pretty clear
where he stands on marijuana.

373
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,520
This is not a non-dangerous drug.

374
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,480
This drug is dangerous.
You cannot play with it.

375
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:40,360
It's not something to laugh about.
Trying to send the message with clarity

376
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,760
that good people
don't smoke marijuana.

377
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,040
Lady Gaga said she's addicted to it
and it is not harmless.

378
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,920
But Lady Gaga also said:

379
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,920
"Men and women
deserve to love each other equally",

380
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,760
and: "touch me in the dark, put
your hands all over my body parts"

381
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,360
so Jeff, if you're going
to live according to Gaga quotes,

382
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,000
accept the entire canon.

383
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:11,120
I'm not saying there shouldn't be laws
that place sensible restrictions,

384
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,720
but our federal laws desperately
need to be brought up to date.

385
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,320
There is no clearer sense

386
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,560
of how establishment
that view is becoming than this.

387
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,440
The cannabis caucus is a bipartisan
effort to protect state marijuana laws

388
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,400
and blow out outdated
federal prohibitions on weed.

389
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,160
These are the guys pushing
for legalized pot in Congress.

390
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,280
There is now
a Cannabis Caucus in D.C.

391
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,120
and it's co-chaired
by these four narcs.

392
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,600
If even an 83-year-old Republican
has come around on this issue,

393
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,880
then it's time
for our laws to catch up.

394
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,600
One bill proposed just this week
would remove marijuana

395
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,440
from the controlled substances act
and officially re-name the ATF

396
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,600
the "bureau of alcohol, tobacco,
marijuana, firearms and explosives".

397
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,400
Just get all the awesome stuff
together in one place.

398
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,320
Why not keep going and make it:
the bureau of alcohol, tobacco,

399
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,280
marijuana, firearms, explosives,
monster trucks, motorcycle jumps

400
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,160
and sick-ass leather jackets
with tigers on them.

401
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,360
And by the way: that jacket
is even sicker in person.

402
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,920
This is my jacket !
This was me this morning !

403
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,560
This is
an actual $6 000 Gucci jacket

404
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,920
and for anyone stupid enough
to buy one of these,

405
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,440
it's worthless now !

406
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,160
I just made your jacket uncool
and worthless by wearing it !

407
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,400
That bill is just one proposal.

408
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,720
Fixing this is a huge undertaking,
marijuana laws affect everything

409
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,320
from environmental regulations
to international treaties.

410
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,840
We should also go back and expunge
records of people convicted

411
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,520
of low-level marijuana
offenses in the past.

412
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,080
I know is a lot of work, which is
why we should start now.

413
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,360
I would argue
that it is absolutely worth it,

414
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,000
for people like Brandon Coats
and for people like Danny Belcher

415
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,040
and perhaps most of all, for Greg,

416
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,240
who has been freaking
the fuck out this whole time.

417
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,120
I can see you, Greg.
And I can hear your thoughts.

418
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,600
And now, this.

419
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:24,400
27 seconds of the breakfast-time
foreplay that is CBS This Morning.

420
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,960
Can I do a little bit
of the Marilyn Monroe ?

421
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,880
- Can I go over to you ?
- Yes.

422
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,760
Happy birthday Charlie Rose.
You're too cooperative.

423
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,400
Watch the hands,
he knows what he's doing.

424
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,200
If he puts his hands under here,
stop him.

425
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,040
Happy birthday to you !

426
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,040
And finally this week,
a quick update regarding zebras.

427
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,240
On our last show, we told you
about Bolivian traffic zebras,

428
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,080
young people in costumes who
direct cars and promote road safety.

429
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,880
We made the case that adding zebras
to things is always an improvement.

430
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,000
We even uploaded 23 minutes
of zebra footage

431
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,840
so you could add zebras
to whatever you wanted.

432
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,720
You people
really came through for us.

433
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:31,160
You took Mariah Carey New Year's Eve
disaster and improved it with zebras,

434
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,760
you completely filled
the White House press room with them

435
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,840
and you put zebras into movies like
"The Shining", "Mad Max: Fury Road".

436
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,280
And, naturally, "Basic Instinct".

437
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,760
It's nice.

438
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,640
Thank you so much for wasting
so much of your time with us.

439
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,640
The point was to make painful
moments easier to swallow.

440
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,680
That's why we put a zebra
into Trump's inauguration.

441
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,440
Someone took that to
the next logical step.

442
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,240
Remember Trump riding the escalator
to announce his candidacy ?

443
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,120
A pretty horrible memory, right ?
Get ready to have it improved.

444
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,720
It's better now. That doesn't
fundamentally change anything.

445
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,360
But it is just better now.

446
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,920
Adding zebras turns out to make great
moments even greater as well.

447
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,160
Good evening.

448
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,520
Tonight I can report
to the American people and to the world

449
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,280
that the US has conducted an operation
that killed Osama Bin Laden,

450
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,160
leader of Al Qaeda.

451
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,200
Yeah. And that is what
I will always remember now.

452
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:58,040
But the most exciting thing was
the response in Bolivia itself.

453
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,960
I was watching it on Sunday, Last Week
Tonight, John Oliver's program.

454
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,120
He starts talking about the zebras.
I thought he was only going to comment.

455
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,560
Suddenly he keeps talking
and talking...

456
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,560
I thought
he was only going to comment.

457
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,280
And suddenly he keeps
talking and talking.

458
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,480
That is an entirely
fair description of this show.

459
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,000
It gets one step better,

460
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,280
because the cebritas themselves
issued a public message.

461
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,640
John Oliver, we want
to invite you to La Paz, Bolivia,

462
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,160
to be a zebra for one day.

463
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,080
The mayor of our wonder city,
Luis Revilla, agrees.

464
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,600
The 265 zebras
are waiting in La Paz.

465
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:45,800
I know that is a friendly invitation
but there is no world in which

466
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,120
the phrase "265 zebras
are waiting for you in La Paz"

467
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,520
does not sound
like a genuine threat.

468
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,160
I have been invited to be a zebra.

469
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,720
I'm not gonna be able to do that soon,
because I have to be here.

470
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,160
So this is a disappointing
moment for both myself and Bolivia.

471
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,960
But as I think we both now know,

472
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,160
there is a real way to improve
moments like this.

473
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,760
Hit it !

474
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,800
It's better now !
That's our show !

475
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,480
Thank you so much
for watching us ! Good night !

476
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,080
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

477
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,360
END OF EPISODE 7,
SEASON IV
