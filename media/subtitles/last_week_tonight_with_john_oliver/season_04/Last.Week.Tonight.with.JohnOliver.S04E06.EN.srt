00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,800
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,400
SEASON IV
EPISODE 6

3
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,200
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,000
Thank you so much for joining us.
We begin with President Trump.

5
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,920
Two words that continue
to sound wrong together

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,160
sort of like Horse pope
or "Dr. Oz".

7
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,800
This was a week of diplomacy.
Or, as it turned out, the opposite.

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,360
President Trump hosting Chancellor
Angela Merkel at the White House.

9
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,320
Their first meeting since Mr. Trump
ridiculed the Chancellor on campaign

10
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,120
accusing her of,
quote, ruining Germany.

11
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,240
First, that is a major insult.
Because historically,

12
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,840
the title of "Chancellor synonymous
with ruining Germany" is taken.

13
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,200
It's gotta be awkward to meet someone
you've talked so much shit about.

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,680
That is why
I never leave the house

15
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,120
because I know Johnny Depp
is somewhere out there,

16
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,720
presumably vaping
into a supermodel's vagina

17
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,920
while he mansplains "acting".

18
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,560
If you think Trump made an extra
effort to smooth things over,

19
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,080
you'd be wrong because
watch what happened

20
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,000
when the media
made a very routine request.

21
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,680
Handshake ?

22
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,040
Do you want to have a handshake ?

23
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,240
Handshake ? Ok.

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,600
Shake her hand,
you weird man !

25
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,160
It is "not often" that
you can genuinely say:

26
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,840
"Trump really should have
touched that woman."

27
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,000
Look at him !
He's just staring straight ahead,

28
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,440
refusing to make eye contact !

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,920
He's treating
the Chancellor of Germany

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,520
like a drunk guy masturbating
in a subway car.

31
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,600
And it did not get any less tense
at their joint press conference.

32
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,600
Trump has been standing by his claim
that Obama had him wiretapped.

33
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,320
And when a German reporter asked,
he tried to pull Merkel into it.

34
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:34,280
As far as wiretapping
by this past administration,

35
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,360
at least we have
something in common, perhaps.

36
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,040
What that very funny joke
is referring to,

37
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,640
is the allegation that the U.S.
monitored Merkel's phone.

38
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,400
And she is not amused,

39
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,360
that may be the most uncomfortable
a U.S. president has ever made her.

40
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,400
George W. Bush once gave her
an unsolicited surprise backrub.

41
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,480
It wasn't just Germany dragged
into Trump's "wiretapping" mess.

42
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,840
His Press Secretary and special guest
on "Gilmore Girls", Melissa McCarthy,

43
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,840
brought a British spy agency
into it, too.

44
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,520
Sean Spicer, has backed claims
that GCHQ was involved

45
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,760
in tapping phones
for Barack Obama.

46
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,480
He didn't use the NSA, the CIA,
the FBI

47
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,720
or the department of justice,
he used GCHQ.

48
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,960
That is going to piss off the British,
and you do "not" want that !

49
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,320
Because if you do,
we will say "oh, dear,"

50
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,360
shake our heads, swallow the anger
and carry it around until we die.

51
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,600
Think about
what he's alleging there.

52
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,880
He is suggesting a U.S. president
enlisted a foreign intelligence service

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,040
to spy on a political adversary,
an explosive charge.

54
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,640
That is why the NSA's Deputy Director
told the BBC it was "arrant nonsense",

55
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,720
revealing "a lack of understanding
in how the relationship works",

56
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,160
and GCHQ called the accusations
"utterly ridiculous".

57
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,520
Rather than distancing himself from
Spicer, Trump backed him up.

58
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,040
All we did was quote a certain
very talented legal mind

59
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,240
who was the one responsible
for saying that on television.

60
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,200
That was a statement made
by a very talented lawyer on FOX.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,520
You shouldn't be talking to me,
but to FOX.

62
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,320
No, we should be talking to "you"
because you're the fucking president

63
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,280
and you're repeating it.

64
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,000
"He only said it because
he heard it on TV"

65
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,280
is barely an acceptable excuse for
why your parrot said a racial slur.

66
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,240
No !
We've been watching The Wire !

67
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,360
That "very talented legal mind"
Trump's talking about is this guy.

68
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,360
FOX News Contributor Judge
Andrew Napolitano,

69
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,920
a man whose persona
is so overwhelmingly non-authoritative

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,200
I assumed he was a judge in
the "Judge Reinhold" sense.

71
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,280
Spicer was quoting Napolitano.
And even by FOX's standards,

72
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,840
"the judge"
is an unreliable source.

73
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,040
He has a history of
entertaining dicey conspiracies.

74
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,680
He questioned whether
Bin Laden was killed,

75
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,480
and he went on Alex Jones' show
and said this, regarding the WTC.

76
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,120
It's hard for me to believe
that it came down by itself.

77
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,520
I think 20 years from now,
people will look at 9-11

78
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,400
the way we look at
the assassination of JFK today.

79
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,640
Couldn't have been done
the way the government said.

80
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,920
What a very talented legal mind !
And it is frankly telling

81
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,920
that even FOX news anchor Bret Baier
didn't stand behind the story.

82
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,080
We love the judge,
we love him here at FOX,

83
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,480
but the FOX News division was
never able to back up those claims.

84
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,040
That is like how you talk
about a racist grandparent.

85
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,840
We love nana,
we love her very much.

86
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,680
But we cannot stand behind
the things she says,

87
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,560
nor would the rest of us
use those specific words.

88
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,640
Also,
she has been watching "The Wire".

89
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,440
If Stringer Bell can say it,
why can't she ? That's her point.

90
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:19,520
If FOX News admits a story
is bullshit, then it is bullshit.

91
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,640
So all the Trump team had to do
was apologize, and move on.

92
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,200
They were so close
to doing that.

93
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:32,240
A senior administration official said
Spicer and NSA Adviser H.R. McMaster

94
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,200
offered an apology
to the British government.

95
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,880
Spicer disputed that saying
the administration had no regrets.

96
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,680
That is Sean Spicer saying
he has no regrets, which is amazing.

97
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,600
If anyone on this planet
should have fucking regrets,

98
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,880
it is you, Madame Ghostbuster,
you should regret everything.

99
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,560
Every life decision that brought you
into this regretful job you hold.

100
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,760
You should really be more regret
than man, a Regretotaur,

101
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,960
half man half regretful beast,
cursed to roam the planet

102
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,760
until one day you're released
from your prison

103
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,320
by the firing you will receive in,
let's say two and a half weeks.

104
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,560
There is no evidence
for Trump's claims.

105
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,120
No motivation for the British
government to be part of this.

106
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,640
Just the word
of a mid-transition werewolf

107
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,640
with questionable views on 9-11.

108
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,800
And yet none of that
seems to matter to Trump.

109
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,640
I could tell you why, but
I'll let Fareed Zakaria do it for me.

110
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,480
The president is indifferent
to things that are true or false.

111
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,040
He spent his life bullshitting.
He has succeeded by bullshitting.

112
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,880
He has gotten
the presidency by bullshitting.

113
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,720
It's hard to tell somebody at
that point that bullshit does not work,

114
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,600
because look at the results !

115
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,000
Yep.
Donald Trump is a bullshit artist.

116
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,880
I know Trump might want
to refute that,

117
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,840
but to be fair someone on TV
did say it, and I am repeating it,

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,840
so therefore it must be true.

119
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,680
And now, this.

120
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,080
Morning news shows
celebrating St. Patrick's Day

121
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,600
literally the only way
they know how.

122
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,760
And top o' the mornin' to ya.
We're live

123
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,320
and a great Friday morning
Saint Paddy's day to ya.

124
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,080
Top o' the mornin'.
St. Patrick's Day.

125
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,080
Top o' the mornin' to ya.

126
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,840
Top o' the mornin' to ya.

127
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,520
Top o' the mornin' to ya,
lad and lasses.

128
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,920
Top o' the mornin' to ya.

129
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,920
The victim
was shot on Denver avenue.

130
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,320
Officers located blood
on the car and weapon.

131
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,880
We will bring you more information
as it becomes available.

132
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,160
Well, top o' the mornin' to ya.

133
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,160
Moving on.
For our main story tonight,

134
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,640
we wanted to take a quick
look at the federal budget.

135
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,240
The only beach
read less appropriate than

136
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,280
"Bill Cosby's Little Bill:
One Dark And Scary Night."

137
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,600
Donald Trump a man who promised
he would run America like a business

138
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,000
gave us our clearest sense yet
of how he plans to do that.

139
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,280
The president revealing his new
budget proposal moments ago.

140
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,760
The most dramatic change in
the government since WW II.

141
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,560
This is a budget blueprint
from the president of the US.

142
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,920
A document that he puts out there.
It is his wish list,

143
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,800
the way he would like the government
to be funded

144
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,520
and what his priorities are.

145
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,880
This budget is a blueprint, known
in Washington as a "skinny budget",

146
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,960
sounds like a line-item that Trump
might've included in his pre-nups.

147
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,640
Think of it, this budget,
as a presidential mood board,

148
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,640
of a president
whose mood can always be described

149
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,560
as: "impatient, vain
and horny for malice."

150
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,040
What is in this thing ?

151
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,600
The blueprint calls for a $54 billion
increase in defense spending.

152
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,120
On the left you see the departments
getting an increase,

153
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,680
that would be defense,
Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs.

154
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,240
The agencies facing cuts,
Environmental Protection Agency,

155
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,240
the State Department,
the Agriculture Department,

156
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,640
the Labor Department,
and the list goes on and on.

157
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,880
It is sort of fitting that
the list of budget cuts scroll by

158
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,200
like the end credits for America.

159
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,920
Thanks for helping us out
Agriculture Department !

160
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,600
Hope you find a gig with the next
country that rises from our ashes !

161
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,200
While this budget is unlikely
to pass in its current form,

162
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,880
it is worth taking
a few minutes to look at it.

163
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,280
It gives us a clear sense
of our president's priorities.

164
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,640
It gives us a chance to get to know

165
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,080
another one of the Trump
administration's key characters.

166
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,680
We've met most of them,

167
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,800
Steve Bannon, a wealthy former
Goldman-Sachs banker

168
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,280
who looks like he woke up on a bench
after losing custody of his children.

169
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,560
Kellyanne Conway, the brave
survivor of a terrorist attack

170
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,080
she completely made up.

171
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,040
Stephen Miller, the least popular
boy at vampire school.

172
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,040
For this budget,
we got to know Mick Mulvaney,

173
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,120
whose name, in my accent,
sounds like what you'd call

174
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,160
a random Irish if you're trying
to get him to fight you.

175
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,040
He is the director of
the Office of Management and Budget.

176
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,880
I'll let him give you a glimpse
into the highly scientific process

177
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,040
by which he put
this budget together.

178
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,360
We wrote the budget by going
through the president's speeches,

179
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,520
the interviews he had given
and talking to him directly.

180
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,760
We took those policies
and turned them into numbers.

181
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,680
Mulvaney treated Trump's
past statements

182
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,280
the way Trump treats women.

183
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,960
Randomly singling out a few
and reducing them down to numbers.

184
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,920
Translating the noises

185
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,600
that come out of Trump's face
into hard policy prescriptions

186
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,400
is almost impossible.

187
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,000
Take this statement
on military spending.

188
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,560
You've got to make the country
rich again and strong again

189
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,320
and so you can afford military
and all of the other things.

190
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,560
I don't know what that was.
It sounds like the audiobook

191
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,480
of "A Farewell To Arms" broadcast
by an iPhone submerged in coffee.

192
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Mulvaney heard "increase
defense spending by $54 billion",

193
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,320
that is what he's proposing.

194
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,640
As for the funding
for nuclear weapons,

195
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,440
they had their basis
in statements like this one.

196
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,520
Putin has built up their military,
their military is much stronger.

197
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,000
He's doing nuclear,
our nuclear is old and tired

198
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,040
and his nuclear is tippy top
from what I hear.

199
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,600
Again: I don't know how
you turn that into policy.

200
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,320
Let's trickledickle money bunnies
into our boom-boom budget.

201
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,640
We aim for tippytop.

202
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,480
We're talking about the most lethal
weapons in the history.

203
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,120
So, if we can, tippy-tippy-top.

204
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,800
That apparently means "a $1.4 billion
increase for National Nuclear security"

205
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,000
"while cutting the Department
of Energy's budget by $1.7 billion".

206
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,960
I can't be certain because I don't
speak fluent toddler-psychopath.

207
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,160
These cuts have made headlines.
No one can say they're surprised

208
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,320
by who is on the receiving end
of some of the worst of them.

209
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,920
His 31-percent cut to the EPA
is making good on clear words.

210
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,520
Environmental protection,
what they do is a disgrace.

211
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,000
Every week they come out
with regulations.

212
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,960
Who'll protect
the environment ?

213
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,000
We can leave a little bit
but you can't destroy businesses.

214
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,440
We can leave
a little bit of the environment.

215
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,960
Specifically: this fish,
this bit of crabgrass in Utah

216
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,000
and one of these meerkats.

217
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,600
So, don't get too attached,
one on the right.

218
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,440
There is nothing wrong
with cuts in principle.

219
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:07,600
With budgets as with haircuts, it's
where and how you cut that matters.

220
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,960
I say that as a grown man

221
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,920
who had bangs on national TV
for seven years.

222
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,680
Cool ? Cool.

223
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,960
Non-defense discretionary spending
is already at its lowest level

224
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,480
relative to GDP in over 15 years,

225
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,200
lower than any year
of Reagan's presidency.

226
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,400
That's what makes something
like Trump's proposed 28-percent cut

227
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,040
to the budget for the State Department
and USAID so frightening.

228
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,080
Secretary Of State, Rex Tillerson,
doesn't seem that worried

229
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,240
and one of the reasons
he gave for that was surprising.

230
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,040
What the president is asking
the State Department to do

231
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,440
is reflective of a couple
of expectations.

232
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,600
As time goes by, there will be
fewer military conflicts

233
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,440
that the U.S. will be
directly engaged in.

234
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,320
You think we're gonna have fewer
military conflicts under Trump ?

235
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,960
There is no way that is true.

236
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,120
He just needs one person to tell him
World War I was called "The Great War"

237
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,760
and he's going to want to have
a better one out of pettiness.

238
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,320
Making big cuts to things
like the State Department

239
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,240
and the EPA
isn't just short-sighted,

240
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,480
it doesn't even
make fiscal sense.

241
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,120
The EPA is responsible for .2%
of federal spending,

242
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,120
and the State Department
and USAID are 1.4%.

243
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,600
So you don't cut those agencies
as a cost-saving measure,

244
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,120
you do it as a "fuck you".

245
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,320
It is the budgetary equivalent
of inviting Mitt Romney out to dinner

246
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,760
at Jean-Georges before not offering
him a cabinet position.

247
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:50,520
That was awesome by the way.
Trump is so consistently monstrous,

248
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,440
sometimes out of coincidence,
he happens to do something amazing.

249
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,680
Trump is truly the stopped clock
of assholes.

250
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,840
His pettiness extends on tiny items
his budget eliminates funding for,

251
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,560
like the National Endowments
for the Arts and the Humanities

252
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,200
and the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting,

253
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,320
which last year made up less than
.02% of federal spending.

254
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,400
According to Mulvaney, it is unfair
to expect people to pay that much.

255
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,520
When you start looking at the places
that will reduce spending,

256
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,960
can we really continue to ask
a coal miner in West Virginia

257
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,080
or a single mom in Detroit
to pay for these programs ?

258
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,160
We can ask them
to pay for defense,

259
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,520
but not to continue to pay for
Public Broadcasting.

260
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:42,080
That argument isn't just insulting,
it's absolutely ridiculous.

261
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,200
The military keeps single mothers safe,
on a day-today basis,

262
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,520
"Bob the Builder"
is a lifesaver for them.

263
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,280
Declan, honey, mommy's gonna lie
down while you watch some Bob.

264
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,680
He's the only man
I trust anymore.

265
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,840
If your real concern is for
the hard-earned dollars

266
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,720
of single mothers and coal miners,
let's break that down.

267
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,480
Because if your single
mother needs to work

268
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,720
and her child attends a school,
she'll need access to WINGS for Kids,

269
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,560
an after-school program that
serves 1 600 children in three states.

270
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,760
Guess what ?

271
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,040
Under President Trump's new
proposed federal budget,

272
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,760
WINGS' source of funding
would be eliminated.

273
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,480
Bridget Laird is the CEO.

274
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,400
- How does that make you feel ?
- Devastated.

275
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,400
Jessica Williams has two daughters
in the program.

276
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,120
What happens if it goes away ?

277
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:42,800
I really don't know how I could...
I really don't know. I would be lost.

278
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,640
That is a really bad cut.
I say that as a man who no one stopped

279
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,240
from going into a SuperCuts
with a photo of Demi Moore in "Ghost"

280
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,080
and saying:
"this, but worse."

281
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,160
As for Mick Mulvaney's
hypothetical coal miners,

282
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,120
let's look at what Trump's budget
cuts from the Appalachian region.

283
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,000
One program at risk of losing funding
is Appalachian Regional Commission,

284
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,800
which funded 35 different projects and
programs in Tennessee last year.

285
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,720
35 programs in Tennessee !
That list includes

286
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,680
the Healthier Tennessee
Communities Initiative,

287
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,160
The Boys & Girls Clubs
of Tennessee Valley

288
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,000
and The Governor's Books
From Birth Foundation.

289
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,320
All contain positive words, I'm
presuming that also in line for cuts

290
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,560
are The Kid-Kitten
Hardhat Alliance

291
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,640
and the Grandma's Wish Coalition
for Warm Cookies from the Oven.

292
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,600
The cookies will be thrown away,
the grandma will be put down.

293
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,120
Those cuts are coming in a state
that went for Trump.

294
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,960
Which leads us
to the weirdest thing of all:

295
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,720
some of the cuts in Trump's budget
impact groups that voted for him.

296
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,440
Rural airports. We spend money to
help subsidize rural airports

297
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,200
where they otherwise
couldn't have air service.

298
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,520
Maybe on principle that's a bad thing,

299
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,360
but the people who are gonna lose
their airports if we stop doing that

300
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,840
are the Trump voters.

301
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,200
Trump's rise was fueled
by people in red states

302
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,400
who were irritated that liberals
refer to them as "flyover country".

303
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,040
But this budget could turn some
of them into flyover country

304
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,520
because there would be
no other option.

305
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,520
Even some Republicans
are now wary of this budget.

306
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,440
Hal Rogers, former chair of the
House Appropriations Committee,

307
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,440
called many of the cuts "draconian,
careless and counter-productive."

308
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,960
A Republican saying that
about budget cuts

309
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,840
is like a toddler telling you:
"this balloon fucking sucks".

310
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,880
Really ?
I really thought you liked those !

311
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,640
Trump's defenders will say this
is him being a businessman.

312
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,760
It's a negotiation. The sort of thing
you could learn all about in his book:

313
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,480
The Art of the... I Seem To Be
Betraying Everyone Who Supported Me,

314
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,080
Well, Forget It. Let's Talk About
All The Trim I Got In The 80s !

315
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,560
But if anything resembling
this budget passes,

316
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,640
many of Trump's voters
will wind up getting burned.

317
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,480
And they are going to be angry.
Trump himself should know that,

318
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,520
given that, in "The Art of the Deal",
he said this.

319
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,960
You can't con people,
at least not for long.

320
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,960
You can create excitement,
you can do wonderful promotion

321
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,760
and get all kinds of press, and
you can throw in a little hyperbole.

322
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,640
If you don't deliver the goods,
people will eventually catch on.

323
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,600
I think people are catching on.

324
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,640
It's taking
longer than is perhaps ideal,

325
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,800
but soon all of us will be fed up
right up to the tippy fucking top.

326
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,000
And now this.

327
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,560
A special St. Patrick's Day moment
from Fox & Friends.

328
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,920
Today is St. Patrick's Day,
so we'll be celebrating throughout.

329
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,360
What did you just do ?

330
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,000
I moved the leprechaun. Didn't realize
there was one behind me.

331
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,160
A couple of years ago
when we had a leprechaun on the show !

332
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,440
I don't think
that video's available.

333
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,040
You wish that video
wasn't available...

334
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,160
Let's go to Judge Andrew Napolitano
with a special...

335
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,800
I got my new buddy here from
the University of Notre Dame.

336
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,400
What a fun memory.

337
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,600
We hired this leprechaun
off of Craigslist.

338
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,640
You get exactly what you pay for.

339
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,120
Fuck you.

340
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,960
And finally this week,
before we go,

341
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,160
I know the world
is a bleak place right now.

342
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,960
So we wanted to leave you with
a happy story. It involves Bolivia,

343
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,360
a country you think about so little,
you don't realize that's not Bolivia,

344
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,800
that's Colombia,
except it isn't, that's Venezuela,

345
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,360
that is Colombia,
except it isn't, that's Bolivia,

346
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,560
which is the one
we were looking for.

347
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,640
Which one's Colombia ?
There is no way to know.

348
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:10,640
The Bolivian city of La Paz
has had problems with their roads,

349
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,960
including traffic jams and
a high rate of fatal accidents.

350
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,520
I know you're thinking:

351
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,320
your "happy" story involves fatal
car accidents in Bolivia ?

352
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,920
Wait, trust me. Because this
is the solution they came up with.

353
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,920
Appropriating the image
of the crosswalks, called "zebras",

354
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,120
and dressed in a costume
of the animal by the same name,

355
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:39,960
these young people have been going
into the street of La Paz for 13 years,

356
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,960
with the goal of educating
the citizens with love

357
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,800
and changing the chaotic face
of the vehicular traffic in this city.

358
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,240
Admit it:
you didn't see that coming.

359
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,520
Not a single one of you was going:
"Traffic zebras. I'm calling it."

360
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,640
These zebras don't have policing
powers, issue tickets or make arrests.

361
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,160
They just tease people.
And if you look online,

362
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,080
there is incredible footage
of them in action.

363
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,240
From a zebra holding his head
while a man jaywalks,

364
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,360
to one dancing in front of a van
that stops just in the nick of time,

365
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,040
to this zebra risking
his life to stop a car,

366
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,480
to the many clips of zebras dancing,
every single one of which

367
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:35,000
is absolutely superb.

368
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,080
Watch him throw that down.

369
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,360
You may be wondering:
how did this happen ?

370
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,920
It was based on a similar program
in Colombia

371
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,680
where they dispatched traffic
mimes to monitor pedestrians.

372
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,480
As far as having mimes
rove around your city,

373
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,280
I think we can all agree: no.

374
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,320
Not only is it unpleasant, but being
mocked by a mime doesn't even work.

375
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,240
All you have to say is "I can talk
and you can't." Argument won.

376
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,880
You lock him in a glass box
and you walk away.

377
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Bolivia has taken it up a notch
with this zebra business.

378
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,200
The program started with
24 of them and today

379
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,240
in La Paz alone there are 265.

380
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,440
A population boom so great
it puts actual zebras to shame.

381
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,840
That is saying something because
zebras notoriously have no shame.

382
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,400
Put it away !

383
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,680
That thing is a liability !
Tuck it away !

384
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:41,760
While it may look fun for people,
this is a real job, with strict rules.

385
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,200
They explained some
of the rules to be zebras like:

386
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,120
honor the costume,
don't eat when you work,

387
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,440
never take your head off.

388
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,680
A good rule.
Never take your head off.

389
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,160
You cannot risk shattering a child's
belief that you are

390
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,280
a 'real' free-roaming, bipedal equid
six thousand miles from Africa.

391
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,840
That applies even in
interview situations.

392
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,840
There are many clips of reporters
shoving microphones in zebras' faces.

393
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,880
Even one with a zebra giving
an interview to another zebra.

394
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,880
This is very significant for me.
I really like what I'm doing

395
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,520
it's not just about
telling people what to do.

396
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,280
Every interview is improved
by a zebra head.

397
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,400
There's a lesson
for everyone there.

398
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,680
Stressful interview with 60 minutes ?
Put on a zebra head.

399
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,600
Tough questions on the red carpet ?
You put on a zebra head.

400
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,960
Sean Spicer ?
Get yourself a zebra head, man.

401
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,640
What is wrong with you ?

402
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,040
Here's the thing: it doesn't just help
with Bolivia's traffic.

403
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,560
Many of the people in those
costumes really need the work.

404
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,400
Many of the zebras are young people
recovering drug addicts and alcoholics.

405
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,480
It's a way for them
to get their lives back on track

406
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,840
and to give
something back to society.

407
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,800
They're not only getting
their lives on track,

408
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:09,320
the existence of these zebras is
keeping my life on track right now.

409
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,000
And is it any wonder
how beloved these "cebritas" are,

410
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,640
considering the attitude
that they project ?

411
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:25,360
One never stops being a zebra. I'm
a zebra in my heart, wherever I go.

412
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,160
Yes, the zebra
was inside her the whole time,

413
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,320
which sounds like a description
for a very risque YouTube video.

414
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,280
I've got a few questions here !

415
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,800
How the hell did no one tell me
about this before ?

416
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,920
We've been clear about our interest
in South American countries

417
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,160
you have scant geographical knowledge
of and people in animal costumes.

418
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,440
I have needed
this over the last few months.

419
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,520
The news has been hard. Which brings
me to my second question:

420
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,840
if zebras can make
Bolivian traffic jams bearable,

421
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,680
what else could they help with ?

422
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,920
So here is what we've done:
we made our own Bolivian zebra

423
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,920
and been seeing if they can help
make painful moments easier to take.

424
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,440
Remember Trump's inauguration ?
Tough to watch, right ?

425
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,400
It's a lot easier to watch
with a zebra involved.

426
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,880
I, Donald John Trump
do solemnly swear...

427
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,520
I, Donald John Trump,
do solemnly swear...

428
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,160
That I will faithfully execute...

429
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,840
That I will faithfully execute...

430
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,960
The office of president
of the United States.

431
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,240
The office of president
of the United States.

432
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,080
See ? It's better, right ?

433
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,280
Again: it doesn't change anything,
but it is easier to watch.

434
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,440
This works for moments
of frustration, too.

435
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,600
Remember Tuesday night,
when Rachel Maddow made you sit

436
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,280
through 19 minutes of preamble to get
to what amounted to nothing ?

437
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,920
You know what could've helped ?
A zebra to share your pain.

438
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,880
Somebody has decided
to leak

439
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:11,240
a portion of his 2005 tax return,
which is how and why we got it

440
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,840
and I am sure it is only the start

441
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,720
but it's a start
and our little piece of it.

442
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,800
We just got it.
We'll go through it next.

443
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,880
I promise, it works for anything.
Take "Manchester by the Sea".

444
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,520
Pretty harrowing movie !
That couple went through hell.

445
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,440
Now if only
they weren't so alone.

446
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,720
Maybe you don't wanna talk
to me. Let me finish.

447
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,760
My heart was broken.

448
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,920
It's always gonna be broken.

449
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,360
And I know yours is broken, too.

450
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,480
Look, I think it's pretty clear.

451
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,080
With things in America
the way they are now,

452
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,400
we need these zebras
like never before.

453
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,000
We've uploaded footage
of a green screen zebra

454
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,760
going through
a variety of emotions.

455
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,320
Use them however you want.
Let us know whatever you did

456
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,520
with the hashtag JustAddZebras.

457
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,080
That is our show.
Thank you for watching.

458
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:31,840
We'll be off next week. Good night.
Please enjoy a dancing zebra !

459
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,560
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

460
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,280
END OF EPISODE 6,
SEASON IV
