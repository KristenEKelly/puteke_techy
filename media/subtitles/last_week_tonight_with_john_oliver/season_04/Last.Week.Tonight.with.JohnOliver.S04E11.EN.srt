LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,160
Season IV
Episode 11

3
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,560
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,000
Thank you so much for joining us.
Let's get right into it,

5
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,520
there's a lot to get through,
and let's begin with New Zealand,

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,120
home of the planet's
most worthless bird.

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,040
You are nothing. Look at me.
You are nothing.

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,560
The ruling party has been at
the center of a ridiculous court case.

9
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,960
The high court has been filled
with the sounds of bad boy Eminem.

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,320
He accused the National Party
of ripping off one of his biggest hits.

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,320
Here's Eminem's "Lose Yourself".

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,440
This is National's advert.

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,080
As we have mentioned before,
New Zealand's National Party has been

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,520
accused of ripping off Eminem,
or as they call him: "Iminim".

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,280
And it is unquestionably
the lamest rap beef

16
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,360
since Lil Wayne's five-year
feud with William H. Macy.

17
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,880
National Party's defense is
that they used a different song.

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,840
The name of the song used
by National was "Eminem Esque".

19
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,840
It's true: the track they used
is literally called "Eminem-esque".

20
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,040
If you are going to rip off
someone else's work,

21
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,200
don't include the name
of the person you're ripping off.

22
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,440
Call it "This May Or May Not Be
Copyright Infringement",

23
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,200
or
"Please Don't Tell Anyone About This",

24
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,560
or "Blurred Lines".

25
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,040
I am thankful that neither side
backed down on this,

26
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,640
because this court case has been
everything I needed right now.

27
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,120
Watch
this moment from the trial.

28
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,920
I'm now going to play
the sound recording,

29
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,600
which embodies
the musical work "Lose Yourself".

30
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,920
That's the greatest thing
I've ever seen.

31
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,720
Some define comedy
as "tragedy plus time".

32
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,840
For me, the purest definition
is "a middle-aged Kiwi in a robe"

33
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,080
"playing Eminem's 'Lose Yourself'
to a motionless courtroom".

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,080
My favorite thing about that
is this woman's reaction.

35
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,520
She is questioning every life
choice that led her to this moment,

36
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,600
and hopefully not regretting
a single one of them.

37
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,480
That lawyer for Eminem's
music publisher

38
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,280
offered his own deep interpretation
of the song.

39
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,160
The idea of losing yourself
in the moment

40
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,600
and not missing opportunities
in life is closely associated

41
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,400
with the guitar rift
at the beginning of the song

42
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,920
and is why the song appeals
to both the public

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,480
and those who wish to influence
the public by advertising.

44
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,880
I now want to hear him describe
every single iconic rap song:

45
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,840
When the artist Juvenile uses
his incessant drum pattern,

46
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,640
it underlines his central thesis:
that the young woman in question

47
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,640
appears pleasing to the eye,
and that he, the singer,

48
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,400
would very much appreciate it if she
were to back that ass up.

49
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,000
There is nothing I want more
than to spend the whole show

50
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,040
breaking down what is
projected to be a six-day court case,

51
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,240
but we must move on to
the US House of Representatives.

52
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,680
Basically, 434 dorks
and Virginia's Don Beyer.

53
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,160
The guy is a fucking baller.

54
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,800
Look at him, he knows.
This week, the House made big news.

55
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,040
The House has passed a bill to repeal
and replace Obamacare.

56
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,280
The vote was tight:
217 for and 213 against.

57
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,880
The US House passed the American
Health Care Act by a whisker.

58
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,360
They were so desperate for votes,
Chaffetz flew in following foot surgery

59
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,440
zipping around like a corgi
with hip dysplasia.

60
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,240
Changes were still being made
to the bill this week

61
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,240
and CBO, which estimates the cost
and impacts of proposed laws,

62
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,000
hadn't even had time
to score the final version.

63
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,720
Members of Congress admitted
they hadn't read the whole thing.

64
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,040
Did you read this entire bill ?

65
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,840
Yeah. I wouldn't say every, yes.
I turned through every page.

66
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,080
As to whether or not I, I got through
some of the details, no.

67
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,720
But, yes, I attempted
to read the entire bill.

68
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,920
You turned through every page ?
That's not how you read a bill,

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,160
that's how you check for spiders.

70
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,560
I can't say whether this bill will
cause millions to lose insurance,

71
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,680
but it does have the Mark Sanford
no spiders guarantee !

72
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,240
In fairness,
as Chris Collins pointed out,

73
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,520
it's not essential that representatives
read every single word of a bill.

74
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,320
We rely on our staff
and on our committees

75
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,160
and I'm comfortable that I understand
this bill in its entirety,

76
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,040
without pouring through every word
and I'm just being quite honest.

77
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,400
That is actually fair. What matters
is that politicians like Collins

78
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,280
fully understand
the contents of this bill.

79
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,240
But when the Buffalo News asked him
if he knew that it would cut funding

80
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,040
for a program providing insurance
to over 600 000

81
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,840
low and middle-income people
in New York State,

82
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,000
including over 19 000 people in two
counties that he represents parts of,

83
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,560
he indicated that he didn't, and said:
"explain that to me".

84
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,240
I can explain that to you now:

85
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,160
this bill could cause
many of your constituents

86
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,760
to get thrown into an individual
marketplace they cannot afford

87
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,440
and when they realize that, they
are going to be furious with you.

88
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,560
You fucked up. Here is the amount
that you fucked up shown graphically.

89
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,800
Here is shown in a scatterplot.
Here is a Precious Moments figurine

90
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,400
explaining exactly
what you just did.

91
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,520
Clearly enough ?
Maybe ask your staff

92
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,560
to read what she's holding
and tell you what it means.

93
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,320
We talked about everything that
was bad with the previous version,

94
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,880
a bill that was estimated to result
in 24 million fewer Americans

95
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
having insurance after ten years.

96
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,880
The bill that passed had all the bad
things about the last one,

97
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,080
with an unpleasant addition.

98
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,360
Republican bill would roll back
the Affordable Care Act's protections

99
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,040
for patients
with pre-existing conditions.

100
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,560
Health insurers would
have to cover them.

101
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,480
The bill includes a mechanism

102
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,280
allowing insurance companies
to raise rates on those patients.

103
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,840
They took a bad thing and
managed to make it even worse.

104
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,920
Like watching
Mariah Carey's "Glitter" and saying:

105
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,200
You know what this needs ?
Jar Jar Binks.

106
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,400
Republicans are saying
that no one can be denied coverage

107
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,080
for pre-existing conditions
under this bill.

108
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,280
But if you have one, and there is
a gap in your coverage for any reason,

109
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,400
you could be charged more,

110
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,080
potentially so much more that
coverage becomes unaffordable.

111
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,160
It's like if your daughter asks:
"Can I have a cookie ?"

112
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,120
and you say: "Sure,
that'll be $1.5 billion, Katie".

113
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,200
You have not been denied this cookie !
You still have full access to it,

114
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,600
should you choose to become
successful enough to afford it.

115
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,120
Now get out of my sight.

116
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,600
This bill heads to Senate,

117
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,160
who are expected
to write their own version.

118
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,440
While it may be
slightly more moderate,

119
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,400
that could still amount to basically
cutting a shit sandwich in half.

120
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,280
And if any bill gets
to President Trump's desk,

121
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,480
we already know he will sign it.

122
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,080
This guy would sign a live snake,

123
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,000
as long as it had
"Obamacare Repeal" written on it.

124
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,800
So it is dangerous to assume that
this bill will die on its own.

125
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,840
Your senators are incredibly
important now.

126
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,520
You need to let them know
how you feel about this.

127
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,160
You only get one shot at this.
One opportunity.

128
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,240
And I know the perfect song
to pump you up,

129
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,520
but as New Zealand has shown me,
we cannot legally play it.

130
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,960
We can play you "Eight Mile Thug",

131
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,320
an actual Eminem-Esque-esque
song that we found.

132
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,680
The point is, if I may,

133
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,760
you gotta lose track of yourself
in the tune, the minute...

134
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,560
I'm not doing this.
Call your senators. And now, this.

135
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,720
To celebrate
their engagement this week,

136
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,280
a look back at the romance between
Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski.

137
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,240
That's like the fourth time.
We get the point.

138
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,000
No, you don't. You're the last
person on the face of the Earth

139
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,800
that appears to get the point.

140
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,440
I need to talk. Hold on.

141
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,600
- I'd like you to answer...
- It's silly. I'm answering.

142
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,600
- The horse is on the screen.
- It's not what you said.

143
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,400
You don't have to be so snotty.
You don't have to be so rude.

144
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:44,240
Let me say this, because it means
nothing coming from you !

145
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,920
You're being chauvinistic right
now and you need to stop.

146
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,960
Stop the apologizing.
Who would like politics...

147
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,040
- I haven't seen any evidence.
- Do you want me to talk ?

148
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,280
You got your cheap shot in.

149
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,400
No, I would not be quite so smug.

150
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,000
Bring it down and relax a bit.

151
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,400
- You're mad at me ?
- A little bit, yeah.

152
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,240
- Shut up.
- No, I'm wondering.

153
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,800
So that they can say anything
they want, and answer questions.

154
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,920
Okay, there you go.

155
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,600
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns the internet,

156
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,800
repository of knowledge and videos
of goats singing Taylor Swift songs.

157
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,640
Come on !
The internet is an incredible place.

158
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,120
We need to talk about an issue that
is impacting it: net neutrality.

159
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,920
We talked about it
in our fifth-ever episode,

160
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,400
three years ago, a piece that
got a weird amount of attention.

161
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,840
Last Week Tonight languished
in relative obscurity since its debut,

162
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,200
but this week, an Oliver diatribe
about net neutrality went viral.

163
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,720
Fuck you, lady ! I didn't
languish in relative obscurity.

164
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,840
I thrived in relative obscurity.

165
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,800
Relative obscurity
is my middle name.

166
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,840
Being negged by WGBH Boston

167
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,360
was not the weirdest bit of attention
that segment attracted.

168
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,280
That would be this.

169
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,480
It's comedian
John Oliver in New York !

170
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,040
They did a big piece on net neutrality
and the FCC.

171
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,720
He directed everybody to go
to the FCC website

172
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,560
and leave hateful comments.

173
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,960
It turns out it totally worked !
The FCC's web site crashed !

174
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,800
I didn't do anything. People did it.
I merely pointed out a problem.

175
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,520
That is a quintessentially
British excuse.

176
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,800
Can't hold me responsible for what
masses decide to make a fuss about.

177
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,400
Run along, scallywag. I said
good day to you. Good day, sir !

178
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,360
The reason for our segment
three years ago

179
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,520
was that the future of net
neutrality was in question.

180
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,960
The FCC took steps to safeguard it.
And if you're wondering

181
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,920
why I'm even bringing up a problem
seemingly solved, this is why.

182
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,440
The Trump administration announcing
plans to roll back Obama-era

183
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,080
net neutrality rules on equal access.

184
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,640
Of course.
It seems that the Trump era

185
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,320
will control-Z everything
that happened on Obama's watch.

186
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,560
I would not be surprised if one night,
Trump went on TV just to tell us

187
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,080
he killed every turkey
Obama ever pardoned.

188
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,480
But the point is, once again,
net neutrality is in trouble.

189
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,200
And if you need a refresher
on what it involves,

190
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,680
let the star of the 2007 viral smash
video "Chocolate Rain"

191
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,880
explain it to you in thirty seconds.

192
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,640
Net neutrality is the idea that
your pipe to the internet,

193
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,440
whether that is your
cable internet connection,

194
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:11,440
your LTE wireless internet connection,
however you are receiving information.

195
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,800
That pipeline to the internet is not
allowed to arbitrarily pick favorites

196
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,120
in terms of the content
that you consume.

197
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,040
If you like to use Google search and
your roommate likes Bing search,

198
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,480
your internet service provider
can't say:

199
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,160
Bing is paying us a lot of money,
so we're gonna slow down Google

200
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,560
and Yahoo and their other
competitors to make Bing load fast.

201
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,280
He's right. Although, that's
obviously just a hypothetical.

202
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,520
There is no such search engine
as "Bing". Or maybe there is.

203
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,120
There's only one way
to find out, and that's by Googling it

204
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,840
and that's kind of the point.

205
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,840
Net neutrality is about
more than just speed.

206
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,600
It is the principle that internet
service providers, or ISPs,

207
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,080
should not be able to engage
in any sort of fuckery

208
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,000
that limits or manipulates
the choices you make.

209
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,520
It also helps ensure
a level playing field,

210
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,680
so that big companies cannot
undermine small companies

211
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,240
before they can take off.

212
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,680
And without it, Ancestry.com
could easily crush my new site

213
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,720
Just-tell-me-if-I'mRelated-
to-a-Nazi-dot-com.

214
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,360
It's like Ancestry.com except
you get to skip all the bullshit.

215
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,680
Net neutrality is boring. And that
used to work to ISPs' advantage.

216
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,880
But more people know
what it is now,

217
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,520
which is why some companies
have started putting out statements

218
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,760
trumpeting their support for
a "free and open internet".

219
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,600
Verizon created a video to calm
any concerns that you might have.

220
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,320
Jeremy here with Craig Silliman,

221
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,480
our general counsel
and leads our public policy group.

222
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:49,920
Is the FCC going to kill the open
internet rules or net neutrality ?

223
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,480
The FCC is not talking about killing
the net neutrality rules,

224
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,720
not we nor any other ISP
are asking them to kill the rules.

225
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:03,040
They're looking to put the rules
on a different legal footing.

226
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,720
Sounds reasonable. Why wouldn't
you trust the commitment

227
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,280
to open access of a man sitting
at a table blocking a hallway ?

228
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:17,120
But while "a different legal
footing" sounds pretty benign,

229
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,480
it is not.

230
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,240
It's worth understanding how neutrality
landed on its current legal footing,

231
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,120
because it involves Verizon,
so let me explain.

232
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,760
I have to introduce you to two terms
more boring than "net neutrality".

233
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,720
Title I and Title II of the
Communications Act of 1934.

234
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,360
The equivalent of chasing an Ambien
with a shot of chloroform.

235
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,360
Here is what happened:
back in 2010,

236
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,960
the FCC wrote net neutrality
rules governing ISPs,

237
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,640
which were regulated
under the less-strict Title I.

238
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,840
The companies found those rules
inconvenient.

239
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:02,080
Verizon sued the FCC, arguing
it didn't have enough authority

240
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,560
to enforce those rules,
and the court ruled

241
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,440
that if the FCC did want strong,
enforceable net neutrality,

242
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,640
their best option would be
to reclassify ISPs under Title II,

243
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,080
which allows for stronger oversight.

244
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,120
So the FCC did that.
And the fact they did was huge.

245
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,880
So when Verizon claims:
"We love the open internet !"

246
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,200
But why don't we just put it
on a different legal footing ?

247
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,200
It's basically OJ Simpson asking

248
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,200
why you won't let him hold
any of your samurai swords.

249
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:37,120
C'mon, Juice. You know why.
You, if anyone, should know why.

250
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,440
The ISPs now have
a powerful ally on their side,

251
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,480
Trump has appointed a new head
of the FCC, and it is this guy.

252
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,320
Ajit Pai is known for being
anti-regulation, pro-merger.

253
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,160
He said he wanted to take
a weed whacker to current FCC rules

254
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,760
and predicted net neutrality's,
quote: "days are numbered".

255
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,760
"Days are numbered" and "take a weed
whacker" are serial-killer talk.

256
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,560
When the code of federal regulations
looks out its window at night,

257
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,640
there's just Ajit Pai,
standing silently,

258
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,240
holding his weed whacker,
waiting for his chance.

259
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,520
The dangerous thing about Pai
is that he presents himself

260
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,400
as a fun, down-to-Earth nerd.

261
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,320
The kind whose Twitter feed is full
of quotes from "The Big Lebowski".

262
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,080
He quotes it all the time.

263
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,880
Quoting "The Big Lebowski"
is fine in certain contexts,

264
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,640
if you're an actor and it's 1998

265
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,560
and you're filming the movie
"The Big Lebowski".

266
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,360
It is intolerable
in any other context.

267
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,240
That's not his only fun guy
at the office trait.

268
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,520
Watch his very first
press conference.

269
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,920
I will be happy to take
your questions from the panel.

270
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,360
Monty Tayloe, Comm Daily.
How do you plan to examine...

271
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,320
Ajit Pai is the kind of guy who has
a fun, oversize novelty mug,

272
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,480
and he is proud of it.

273
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,800
Here he is showing it off to
a reporter, to his Twitter feed.

274
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,760
In his first speech
as commissioner, he said...

275
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,080
I love walking into my office,
pouring a gallon of coffee

276
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,120
into my Reese's Peanut Butter Cups
mug, and starting my day.

277
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,440
He described his own mug
as "infamous," which is offensive.

278
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,600
At no point should you be describing
your own "fun" mug,

279
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,840
aloud, in the company
of other adults.

280
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,520
It's a fucking mug.
Calling a mug "infamous"

281
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,600
is like calling your Neti Pot
a "real panty-dropper".

282
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,440
In no context
can that be remotely true.

283
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,600
But for all of Pai's doofy,
"I'm just like you guys" persona,

284
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,600
there are some things about him
that you should know:

285
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,720
he is a former lawyer for Verizon
and despite being a smart man,

286
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,960
he sure loves to play dumb over why
ISPs were ever moved to Title II.

287
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,800
For decades before 2015,
we had a free and open internet.

288
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,720
Free and open internet flourished
under light-touch regulation.

289
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,320
We weren't living in some digital
dystopia before the partisan imposition

290
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,400
of a massive plan hatched
in Washington saved all of us.

291
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,000
2015 was not a digital
dystopia for anyone,

292
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,440
with the possible exception
of pizza rat.

293
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,600
Because the internet
put that rat through hell.

294
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,960
One cheat day in three months
of eating Paleo

295
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,360
and she never hears
the fucking end of it.

296
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,040
I said she. Hashtag greasy
filth monster, hashtag feminism.

297
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,280
But Pai's larger argument
is deeply disingenuous.

298
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,000
He has to know that Verizon,
his ex-employer,

299
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,640
won a lawsuit that meant
if the FCC wanted strong protection,

300
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,520
its only real option
was to re-classify the ISPs.

301
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,600
He cheerily insists,
under questioning,

302
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,120
there is no evidence cable companies
were engaging in rampant wrongdoing.

303
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,360
Let's say Comcast created
a new TV series,

304
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,880
and it happened that competed
with a Netflix series similarly.

305
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,280
If these rules go away, how
is there not an incredible incentive

306
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,840
for Comcast to slow Netflix down
coming into my house

307
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,480
and make their video
very robust ?

308
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,840
One of the things that's important to
remember is that it is a hypothetical.

309
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,200
We don't see evidence of that
in the marketplace on widespread level.

310
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,680
There are multiple examples
of ISP fuckery over the years.

311
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,240
A few years back,
Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile

312
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,600
shut out "Google Wallet"
from their phones,

313
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,600
a product that coincidentally
happened to compete

314
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,720
with their own
mobile-payment app.

315
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,400
An app that had
a significant flaw.

316
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,200
It's a little subtle,
but see if you can spot it.

317
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,600
Following in the footsteps
of PayPal and Google Wallet

318
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,880
is a virtual mobile wallet app
called ISIS.

319
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:14,560
That is incredible. If only because
it means that at some point,

320
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,600
someone's mom probably
sent a text along the lines of:

321
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,360
"How do I make a payment
to ISIS ? Love Mom."

322
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,400
PS: let me know about Passover.

323
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,360
When people complained that they
couldn't use Google Wallet,

324
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,200
T-Mobile sent out tweets
like: "we're supporting ISIS",

325
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,840
"we're really loving ISIS" and
"we have chosen to work with ISIS"

326
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,600
"and hope to roll that out
to everyone very soon."

327
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,040
Despite T-Mobile's
vocal support for ISIS,

328
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,680
which is all you should ever think,
when you hear the word T-Mobile,

329
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,560
or ISIS,
they're essentially the same thing,

330
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,080
Pai's main argument is that we don't
need Title II to have net neutrality.

331
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,520
Some of his ideas for what to have
instead are laughably lax.

332
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:07,160
He floated having ISPs voluntarily
agree not to obstruct

333
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,480
or slow consumer access
to web content,

334
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,320
by putting that promise
in their terms of service.

335
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,920
The things that no human being
has ever read

336
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,280
and that can change whenever
companies want them to.

337
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,640
That would make net neutrality as
binding as a proposal on The Bachelor.

338
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,640
Vanessa, I determined you to be
better for my brand than Corinne,

339
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,160
but I reserve the right to change
this agreement in the future,

340
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,120
should ABC ever offer me
a slot on "Fuck Pile Island".

341
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,840
Pai's other big argument
to remove ISPs from Title II

342
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,360
is that it places too great
a regulatory burden on companies

343
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,200
and that it's caused them to scale back
investment in broadband networks.

344
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,400
The economics are simple.

345
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,480
The more heavily
you regulate something,

346
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,440
the less of it you're going to get.

347
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,680
What happened after the FCC
imposed Title II ?

348
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,920
Infrastructure investment declined.

349
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,840
What he is essentially suggesting
is that as soon as Title II came in,

350
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,640
companies said: investing in
infrastructure is too difficult.

351
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,320
We're not doing it anymore.

352
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,080
Pull the cable out of the ground,
we're going back to the telegraph.

353
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,880
Infrastructure investment is harder
to measure than you think.

354
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,280
Pai's numbers are in dispute. Several
companies have gone on the record

355
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,880
saying their business has largely
been unaffected by Title II.

356
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,680
The best way
to gauge Title II's impact

357
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,960
is to listen to what cable companies
told their investors,

358
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,000
to whom they are legally
obligated to tell the truth.

359
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,560
Here is what Verizon
told its investors in 2014

360
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,080
about what the switch
to Title II would mean.

361
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,800
This does not influence
the way we invest.

362
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,280
We'll continue to invest in our
networks and our platforms,

363
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,840
both in wireless and wireline Fios
so nothing will influence that.

364
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,440
Doesn't sound like net neutrality was
jeopardizing investment at all.

365
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,080
That was a phone call.
And it was Verizon.

366
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,640
So it's entirely possible
that every other word was dropped.

367
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,840
Title II is the most solid legal
foundation we have now

368
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,040
for strong
net neutrality protections.

369
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,800
So Pai saying: "let's have
an open internet without it"

370
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,120
is like me saying:"how about
you have a gallon of coffee,"

371
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,240
"without your stupid
fucking mug ?"

372
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,640
Pour it into your hands and trust
you won't get burnt.

373
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,080
I know you're thinking:

374
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,480
"You're making fun of my mug
because you're jealous of it."

375
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,320
To which I would say:
why would I be jealous ?

376
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,360
Your mug's not that big.

377
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,680
You want to know
what I'm drinking ?

378
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,440
The blood of smaller mugs.

379
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,200
Cheers.

380
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:10,160
ISPs will tell you net neutrality could
be protected by an act of Congress.

381
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,640
But I do not trust this
or any Congress

382
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,320
to get something as complicated
as this right.

383
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,120
I wouldn't want
the current president involved,

384
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,880
as he doesn't seem to have
any idea what any of this is.

385
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,560
Trump once tweeted
back in 2014:

386
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,360
Obama's attack on the internet
is another top down power grab.

387
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,880
Net neutrality is Fairness Doctrine.
Will target conservative media.

388
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,120
That's the opposite of what it did !

389
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,440
Trump could not have
been more off base if he'd tweeted:

390
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,280
"Net neutrality is Monroe Doctrine.
Will target the Wu-Tang Clan."

391
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,880
We the people must take
this matter into our own hands.

392
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,800
The FCC are, again, going to invite
public comment on their website.

393
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,880
The process is actually a lot
more complicated this time

394
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,080
than it was three years ago,
you have to go to FCC.gov,

395
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,600
slash lower-case ecfs,
slash search, dash proceedings.

396
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,640
When you get to this page,
put in the proceeding number, 17-108,

397
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,320
then hit search
and on the next page,

398
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,920
"restoring internet freedom"
should be the only result you see.

399
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,040
Click on the link that says "express"
and then can you leave your comment.

400
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,480
And if you're thinking:
"Too complicated, I'm not doing it."

401
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,840
We bought the URL
"go FCC yourself" dot com

402
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,920
and if you go there, it will
land you straight on this page,

403
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,880
where all you have to do is hit
"express" and comment,

404
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,680
telling Ajit Pai that you support
strong net neutrality,

405
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,720
backed by Title II oversight of ISPs.

406
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:52,880
Every internet group needs to come
together like three years ago.

407
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,360
Every subculture must join. Gamers,
YouTube celebrities, Instagram models,

408
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,840
Tom from MySpace,
if you're still alive.

409
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,720
We need all of you !

410
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:08,200
Even Donald Trump's internet
fans on sites like 4chan and Reddit:

411
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,720
the most powerful
online trolls of all.

412
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,840
This subject is one of the few
things that we really agree on.

413
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,080
So express yourselves and harness
the rage you reserve for me.

414
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,480
The rage that you used
when you said I'm:

415
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,800
"genuinely one of the most visually
and intellectually repulsive people",

416
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,480
with "oddly long thumbs",
"batshit crazy eyes"

417
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,040
and a "mouth that looks like
a cemetery after an earthquake".

418
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:39,000
That's pretty good.
Everyone needs to get involved.

419
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,440
Comment now and again once FCC
makes its proposal official.

420
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,120
Call your representative
and your senators.

421
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,480
Do not tell me that you don't have
time to do this.

422
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:55,560
Internet is evidence that we have
way too much time on our hands.

423
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,920
I'm talking to you, those who posted
"May the 4th be with you"

424
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,040
for "Star Wars Day" this
and every fucking year.

425
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,560
I'm talking to you, everyone
who posted on Facebook about:

426
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,240
"ten concerts you've
seen and one you didn't".

427
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,840
And to you, everyone who did it
ironically and added a joke twist,

428
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,520
because you are exactly as bad.

429
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,400
You cannot say that you are too busy
when 540 000 of you

430
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,200
commented on Beyonce's
pregnancy announcement

431
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:28,240
and 673 of you took the time
to review the Grand Canyon on Yelp

432
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,440
seven of whom
gave it a one-star review.

433
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,520
What is wrong with you ?

434
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,480
I'm specifically looking at you,
person on Amazon

435
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,040
who gave "The Wolf Of Wall Street"
one star because, and I quote:

436
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,120
"there were
no wolves in the movie".

437
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,960
And to you, the 31 people
who took the time to say

438
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,840
they found that review helpful.

439
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,880
I'm looking at the frankly
surprising number of people

440
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,960
who, for some reason, keep tweeting
"choke me, daddy" at the Pope.

441
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,800
You're wasting your time.
He's not going to choke you.

442
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,760
The optics would be very bad.

443
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,680
I'm calling upon all of you,

444
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,320
the internet's time-wasters
and troublemakers,

445
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,200
to join me once more, in just five
to ten minutes of minor effort.

446
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,600
I need you to do this ! Once more
unto the breach my friends !

447
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:28,840
Go to this URL and tell the FCC to
preserve net neutrality and Title II !

448
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,280
Once again, commenters,
America needs you to rise

449
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,400
or remain seated in front
of your computer screen.

450
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,880
So please, fly my pretties !
Fly once more !

451
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,800
That is our show. See you next
week. Good night. Fly away !

452
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,080
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

453
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,920
END OF EPISODE 11,
SEASON IV
