00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,520
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,960
SEASON III
EPISODE 29

3
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,640
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !

4
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,080
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

5
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,320
For the last time before the vote,
we begin with the 2016 election.

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,040
"Of course Election Day
is November 8th,"

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,120
"the latest possible date
the election could fall on,"

8
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,960
"the universe punishing us for all
the masturbating we've done 2016".

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,680
The two candidates spent most
of this week furiously campaigning.

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,760
For Hillary Clinton, that meant
calling in help from BeyoncÃ© and Jay -Z,

11
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,040
who she thanked by ruining
one of his songs in front of him.

12
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,760
Jay memorably said
something we should all recall...

13
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,800
Rosa Parks sat
so Martin Luther could walk,

14
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,520
and Martin Luther walked
so Barack Obama could run,

15
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,440
and Barack Obama ran
so all the children could fly !

16
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,360
Cool !

17
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,120
I have to say, with that cadence,
flow, and swag,

18
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,520
Hillary Clinton is truly
the Hillary Clinton of rappers.

19
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,640
As for Donald Trump,
the equivalent of a clear plastic bag

20
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,960
filled with cheeseburgers
and Confederate flag belt buckles,

21
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,480
he spent the week making
a visible effort to restrain himself.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,400
Stay on point, Donald,
stay on point.

23
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,320
No sidetracks, Donald.
Nice and easy. Nice.

24
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,840
Trump's inner monologue
has the tone of a serial killer

25
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,080
stalking his prey at a food court:

26
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,960
"Stay on point.
They haven't seen you yet."

27
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,960
"Be nice and easy.
You're just here for a Cinnabon."

28
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,880
"Niiiiice."

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,680
Before we taped,
there was breaking news

30
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,920
regarding new emails
found on Anthony Weiner's computer

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,040
that started a shit -storm last week.

32
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,400
The FBI and have said they warrant
no new action against Hillary Clinton.

33
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,320
A big deal. Although, watch Trump
campaign manager Kellyanne Conway

34
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,120
try to minimize it
in truly incredible fashion.

35
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,880
I don't believe it is politically
good or bad information.

36
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,880
We have not made this
a centerpiece of our messaging.

37
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,480
Seriously ?
In the word-cloud of your campaign,

38
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,560
"email" is right up there
with "wall", "Mexicans", "big-league",

39
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,480
"unintelligible",
"sniffle" and "wrong !"

40
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,440
Who knows if this new information
about the emails will change minds ?

41
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,560
If you're still undecided,
I don't know if I can help you.

42
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,400
Our main story later won't have
anything to do with this election.

43
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,560
You have to vote, even if you live in a
state where you think it won't matter.

44
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,720
There are some important things
to vote for downballot,

45
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,760
the races that you don't think about

46
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,440
until you're in the voting booth
thinking "Comptroller ?"

47
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,360
"Shit, I did not study for that.
I hope this person's not a Nazi."

48
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,480
But it's not just candidates.
In many places,

49
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,600
there are important ballot initiatives,
from raising the minimum wage,

50
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,080
to legalizing marijuana,
to which I say: dank...

51
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,680
To the death penalty.
It can be confusing language.

52
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,000
Nebraska is voting whether to repeal
an earlier repeal of the death penalty

53
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,440
so voting to repeal
will actually reinstate it.

54
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,760
Which is, I would say: un-dank.

55
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,360
So you should prepare
before you vote.

56
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,120
It's easy if you Google "view
my ballot" and type in your address,

57
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,000
you can see who or what
is on the ballot in your area.

58
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,760
And after that, you can type
"dog dressed as a walrus" into Google

59
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,880
as a little treat for yourself,
because now you actually deserve it.

60
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,960
The point is that there is
a lot to consider on Tuesday.

61
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,960
And barring recounts this nightmare
of a campaign will be over.

62
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,400
Which is good, this election hasn't
so much appealed to our better angels,

63
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,600
as it has groped our better angels,

64
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,760
mocked their weight,
and called them "sixes at best".

65
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,400
We are at a point where this man
has a genuine shot at the presidency,

66
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,880
despite having blown up
a political party,

67
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,680
undermined confidence
in our electoral system,

68
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,320
and unleashed a river
of racism and misogyny.

69
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,760
And I feel
like we've lost sight of this...

70
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,880
He has really stupid hair.
It's important to remember that.

71
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,400
It is frankly hard to believe
that there was a time

72
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,840
when people thought a Trump
candidacy would be funny.

73
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,680
But there was such a time.
As you may remember, three years ago,

74
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,800
I guesthosted The Daily Show,
and there is something you should see.

75
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,000
Republicans better have
something special up their sleeve.

76
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,640
Donald Trump confirmed
that he's considering a run in 2016.

77
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,760
Do it. Do it. Look, look at me.

78
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,360
Do it. I will personally write you
a campaign check now,

79
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,560
on behalf of this country, which
does not want you to be president,

80
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,640
but which badly wants you to run.

81
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,480
Now, in my defense...
I have no defense for that,

82
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,760
and was hoping to think of one before
finishing this sentence: "It's over".

83
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,160
Listen... I want to believe
that America will reject Donald Trump.

84
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,240
That our innate sense of decency
will kick in like some moral autopilot.

85
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,200
But I have been spectacularly
wrong before.

86
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,960
Because, as you might remember,
eight years ago,

87
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,880
I was working as a correspondent
for The Daily Show,

88
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,560
and there's something you should see.

89
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,840
Cubs fans are considered
a subset of the stupid.

90
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,000
Absolutely Jon.
They've had 100 years to figure out

91
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,760
that what they want will never
happen, yet they still yearn for it.

92
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,960
- And that is stupid.
- Yes, it's very stupid.

93
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,240
- Because the Cubs will never win.
- No, that's right, Jon.

94
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,320
The Chicago Cubs will never,
ever win the World Series.

95
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm an idiot. But that clearly shows:
no outcome is certain.

96
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,960
If you are thinking
you don't have to show up to vote,

97
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,600
because the impossible
could not happen,

98
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,960
take it from somebody who has learned
from experience.

99
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,720
You are wrong about that.
And now: this !

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,400
The inevitable sad consequences of
morning shows celebrating Halloween.

101
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,160
This is WITN News, early sunrise.

102
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,040
Just keep swimming !

103
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,000
- Here's our costumes !
- Happy Halloween. Note the stems.

104
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,520
You're supposed to dress up
as your favorite thing.

105
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,280
Is that not perfect ?

106
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,480
- This is Prince over here.
- Like my guitar ?

107
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,600
- And it's even got the symbol.
- Awesome you did a great job.

108
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,960
We need to chill on this fog machine
cause you can't even see us.

109
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,520
In spots such as Uvalde,
Cotulla, Pleasanton, Gonzales...

110
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,680
This is much tougher
with Tyrannosaurus Rex arms.

111
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,760
It be a nice weather today, we be
looking at some beautiful weather

112
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,080
to start our Halloween
in our work week.

113
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,200
It is a spooktacular night
here in the heartland.

114
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,440
We be sailing the high seas
with some gorgeous conditions.

115
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,280
CBS this morning is gonna have
more on the big stories of the day.

116
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,600
The man who fired several shots from
the semi-automatic rifle of the south

117
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,280
end of the parking lot
at a Sports on Tap

118
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,440
about 12:30 Saturday morning
is still not in custody.

119
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,240
Moving on.
For our main story tonight,

120
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,520
I would like to talk to you
about an exciting opportunity.

121
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,680
I need 30 minutes to explain it,

122
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,520
but it has the potential
to transform your life.

123
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,480
I'm talking about multi-level
marketing companies, or MLMs.

124
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,040
Companies like Mary Kay,

125
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,560
Rodan and Fields,
Nu Skin, Amway, and Herbalife.

126
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,440
Generally MLMs
have two main things in common.

127
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,520
You don't see them on store shelves,
you buy them through distributors,

128
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,760
like friends,
family and coworkers.

129
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,640
Those distributors are always
looking for more people to join them

130
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,960
and they have
an attractive message.

131
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,280
- Why Herbalife ?
- You are your own boss.

132
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,440
- Earn extra money.
- Work from home.

133
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,920
- Raise your children.
- Name your hours.

134
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,200
- Make part time or full time money.
- Paying the bills.

135
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,840
Share this with 10 people.

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,440
That you care about that you love
that you adore that you admire.

137
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,120
- 20 people ! 30 people !
- What're you waiting for ?

138
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,200
100 people ! Share it with everybody !
They want what we have ! We got it !

139
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,840
I'm supposed to share that with 10
people I love, adore, and admire ?

140
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,520
A tough ask. There are the judges
on this season of Project Runway.

141
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,800
That's three. There's Tim Gunn.
That's obviously four.

142
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,200
If you count Tim Gunn twice,
that's five,

143
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,320
but I'm still five short,
and I am out, now.

144
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,920
Before you brush this industry off,
you should know:

145
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,920
it did around 36 billion dollars
in retail sales last year in the US.

146
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,480
You probably know someone
who is considering joining an MLM,

147
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,000
or who already has,

148
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,600
and is posting about it ten times
a day on Facebook or Instagram.

149
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,680
If you do know someone like that,
or have considered signing up yourself,

150
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,240
this story is important.

151
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,120
Let me explain
how the system is supposed to work.

152
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,480
Generally, distributors have
two main ways to make money:

153
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,760
sell the product itself whether it's
makeup, vitamins, or health shakes.

154
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,560
And this is key.
Recruit other people into the company,

155
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,440
get money based on their sales,
and the sales of people they recruit.

156
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,800
Just look at Vemma.

157
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,200
A few years ago,
a hidden camera caught a distributor

158
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,720
walking a prospective recruit
through just how easy it can be.

159
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,280
Let's say you signed up 3 friends.
You and I would help those 3 friends

160
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,960
sign up their 3 friends and get their
$700 check, so there's 9 people.

161
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,000
Then we help those 9 people
sign up their 3 friends,

162
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,160
then they get their 7,
so everyone kind of gets money back.

163
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,480
You king of get your money back ?!
That's as reassuring as hearing

164
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,000
a doctor say he "kind of" knows
where your appendix is.

165
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,160
"It's probably
somewhere near the spleen."

166
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,080
And if you are thinking: "That
business structure sounds familiar"

167
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,960
"isn't that a pyramid scheme ?"

168
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,560
There was a journalist waiting outside
to ask the same question.

169
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,680
It's not an illegal pyramid scheme,
it's a direct-selling network company.

170
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,720
- Is it shaped like a pyramid ?
- Yes.

171
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,800
- It's not an illegal pyramid scheme ?
- No.

172
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,000
I get it. So, it's not a pyramid,
it's just pyramid-shaped.

173
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,640
Like a Dorito, or an Angry Bird.
Or just a pile of bullshit.

174
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,000
Let's put that pyramid question aside,
because from the outside,

175
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,160
these companies
do have the trappings of legitimacy.

176
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,880
Many have high-profile
celebrity endorsers.

177
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,080
Vemma had noted science
expert Jenny McCarthy.

178
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,680
Advocare has esteemed
ball-thrower Drew Brees,

179
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,000
and an MLM called Max International
had this guy.

180
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,760
After more than a year
of due diligence,

181
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,000
Gena and I
joined Max International

182
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,960
as home-based distributors
and media spokespersons.

183
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,000
To be a fly on the wall
while Gena and Chuck

184
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,720
were poring over the numbers
during that due diligence session,

185
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,280
Gena with an adding machine,
Chuck randomly kickin' stuff.

186
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,320
It'd be like watching Lennon
and McCartney write Sergeant Pepper !

187
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,720
Still, for many MLMs,
the biggest celebrity is their founder,

188
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,560
who can enjoy cul-like status.

189
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,440
Just look at J.R. Ridinger,
CEO of Market America.

190
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,760
At company conferences,
the guy makes quite an entrance.

191
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,680
Ladies and gentlemen,

192
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,840
J ! R ! Ridingerrrr !

193
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,640
Fourth string wedding chapel Elvis,
calm the fuck down.

194
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,240
That's his walk on. Once he gets going,
he puts on a real show,

195
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,640
demonstrating
how you can pump money,

196
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,760
dramatizing the rat race by sweatily
running around in a giant wheel,

197
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,760
and screaming
at the gravestone of "Joe Nobody",

198
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,840
who never fulfilled his potential.

199
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,920
Joe, c'mon, man !
The dreams you told me about !

200
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,520
We can actually do them now !
We don't have to wait, man !

201
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,200
It works ! And I'm doing it !

202
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,440
And I wanna help you do it
because it's so good, Joe !

203
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,040
This is amazing !
We can have vacations and sailboats

204
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,360
and we can have multiple homes,
and you can give your wife

205
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,560
the jewelry that she deserves !

206
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,680
You're gonna be a hero !
C'mon, Joe, let's do it !

207
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,280
Get up, Joe, get up !
Before it's too late, get up !

208
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:13,240
Holy shit ! All I can say is,
thank goodness funerals

209
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,640
don't have a "speak now or forever
hold your peace" section.

210
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,360
He'd be at every cemetery
delivering motivational speeches.

211
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,080
"She lived a good life ? Fuck you.
Your grandmother died a loser."

212
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,600
"Come back to life, Ethel !
You can still have that yacht !"

213
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,080
"Come back to life !"

214
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,560
And the dangling
of vast lifestyle improvements

215
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,320
is at the heart of the MLM pitch.

216
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,760
Their materials feature flashy cars
and luxury travel that you can achieve.

217
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,400
And just watch
a distributor from Youngevity

218
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,080
walk you through a future
dream scenario, in exquisite detail.

219
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,160
In two years
this is what's gonna happen to you:

220
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,080
you are gonna drive to your work,

221
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,280
you're gonna walk
into your boss' office,

222
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,400
you're gonna sit down,
and you're gonna quit your job.

223
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,560
You're gonna explain that
that little "pyramid scheme" thing

224
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,920
that you almost got terminated
for last year,

225
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,800
you're now an entrepreneur and
you're gonna be doing that full time.

226
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,560
Back up, back up: did you just say
"pyramid scheme" ?

227
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,320
And then "almost got terminated" ?

228
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,720
And then you're going to go out
to the parking lot,

229
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:35,280
you're going to get into your silver
Mercedes that Youngevity has paid for

230
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,360
and you're gonna drive home...

231
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,120
No, wait, actually first
you're gonna drive to the bank.

232
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,520
I'm sorry: I hate to dwell on this,

233
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,480
but you definitely said
"pyramid scheme" back then,

234
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,440
but I'm sorry, now we're suddenly
going to the bank ?

235
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,360
You're gonna walk into the bank and
you're gonna deposit your coding bonus

236
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,480
and the lady's gonna say
"will that be checking or savings ?"

237
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,880
and you're gonna say:

238
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,840
"I don't really care,
I get these all the time."

239
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,640
And the lady's gonna say
"That's fantastic,"

240
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,400
"but I need to know
which account this goes into."

241
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,960
You're gonna say; "Makes no
difference to me !" She's gonna say:

242
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,320
"I can't deposit this unless
you specify which account."

243
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,360
You're gonna say "It's all gravy !"

244
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,840
She's gonna say "The checking ?"
You're gonna say "I'm lovin' it !"

245
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,240
And she's gonna say
"do I need to get security ?"

246
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,600
And you're gonna say
"the account ending in 8424, please".

247
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,160
Now, Youngevity told us
that that woman's claims

248
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,240
"are not authorized by the company,
and are against Youngevity policy".

249
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,400
"Although, that video was taken
at one of their official events,"

250
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,440
"and the woman, Denice Chenault,"

251
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,560
"is featured with her husband
on the company website,"

252
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,240
"with the words "Denice
and Tom Chenault are Youngevity".

253
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,440
You don't let someone embody your
company if you don't agree with them.

254
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,760
If Flo turned out to run
a dogfighting ring,

255
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,400
Progressive would wipe her
off their website immediately.

256
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,560
And you know that's coming.
You can see it in her eyes.

257
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,320
There are dead dogs dancing in there.

258
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,080
But you cannot deny the picture
that she paints is enticing.

259
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,440
Who doesn't want to tell their boss
to go fuck themselves ?

260
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,280
Half my staff would do
it right now if they could.

261
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,840
But MLM's hold out the hope
that if you work hard,

262
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,840
you can take control of your life,

263
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,600
start your own business,
and help your family.

264
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,160
But how real is the opportunity ?

265
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,520
Let's take a look at one
of these companies in depth.

266
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,720
Herbalife.
You saw its pitch earlier.

267
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,360
It was the one that you were supposed
to send to 10, 20, 100 people.

268
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,640
It sells nutritional supplements
shakes, and vitamins,

269
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,000
and it's one of the biggest
MLM's around,

270
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,280
with net sales
of $4.5 billion last year.

271
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,000
It has celebrities
who talk up its benefits,

272
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,520
from superstar athletes
like Cristiano Ronaldo,

273
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,840
to pretty much the last person
you're expecting to see.

274
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,480
- You have a great product.
- You're a product of the product.

275
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,680
I am.

276
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,640
It has every combination
of things that I like.

277
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,400
It's a very good product,
delivered by really good people.

278
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,720
Yes, that is Madeleine Albright,
talking to Herbalife's CEO,

279
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,160
claiming she's a product
of the product !

280
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,040
So forget studying
at Columbia and Johns Hopkins.

281
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,600
If you want to be like
the first female secretary of state,

282
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,920
just chug a couple of vanilla-adjacent
nutri-shakes a day

283
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,800
and thank her in the morning.

284
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,040
And about those products:
in its early days,

285
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,880
Herbalife was accused
of overstating their benefits,

286
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,880
claiming in the '80s that one product
"helped relieve everything"

287
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,360
"from venereal disease
to tumors to bedwetting."

288
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,400
Their founder, Mark Hughes
was asked by a senate subcommittee

289
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,080
to answer experts who'd called
his diet products into question

290
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,720
and this was his response.

291
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,040
If they're so expert on weight loss,
why were they so fat yesterday ?

292
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,320
I'm not trying to make any jokes, but I
think that they oughta use our product.

293
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,840
First: he seems great.

294
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:09,560
But why would anyone in the '80s
take Herbalife to lose weight ?

295
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,600
They had cocaine !

296
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,880
Come to think of it,
we also have cocaine.

297
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,440
The point is: cocaine
is an effective weight-loss option.

298
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,440
It's not where I thought I was going,
but it is where we have ended up.

299
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,000
To be fair,
that was 30 years ago,

300
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,640
and a lot has changed
at the company since then.

301
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,480
Although, when ABC News
filmed some Herbalife distributors,

302
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,120
they found some claims that seemed
to echo the company's past.

303
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,960
This Herbalife distributor
in New York told us the story

304
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,600
of a woman who overcame
a brain tumor thanks to Herbalife.

305
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,600
Whatever it is that the product did,
it helped her a lot.

306
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,960
New recruits were told, Herbalife
products help to treat heart disease.

307
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,560
24 years ago, I had early congestive
heart failure. Nothing worked.

308
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,040
And even helped
one woman get pregnant.

309
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,560
I am 40 years old.
I have my first pregnancy.

310
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,480
That is obviously bullshit.

311
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,880
Nutritional shakes can't
help you get pregnant.

312
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,040
Only three liquids
that can do that:

313
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,560
a glass of merlot,
the honey-smooth music of Sade

314
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,760
and good old-fashioned jizz.

315
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,200
People might be
making claims like that

316
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,520
because they are desperate
to move excess product.

317
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,320
Broadly speaking,
under Herbalife's system,

318
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,320
distributors can get bonuses and
massive discounts on products,

319
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,320
based on how much they buy,
a huge incentive to buy in bulk.

320
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,200
Let's say you're selling Herbalife's
disgusting creamy chicken soup powder

321
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,040
for $13,35 a box.

322
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,400
Cheaper you can buy it
from Herbalife,

323
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,240
the more profit you could make.

324
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,560
To stay qualified for those discounts,
you have to keep buying product.

325
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,680
It might not be easy to sell
that extra soup. It's a little pricey.

326
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,360
We tried it, it tastes like the wood
shavings inside a gerbil cage.

327
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,080
As one former top distributor
will tell you,

328
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,760
if you are accumulating product,
that can lead to a problem

329
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,960
common enough
to have a special name.

330
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,160
We'd call it garage qualified.

331
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,240
They would stack as much product
as they can in their garage.

332
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,320
At some point they would realize
they have to quit.

333
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,600
People buy product,
more than they can sell.

334
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,040
It sits in a garage.
What happens ?

335
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,040
- There's gotta be an endpoint here !
- When they run out of money.

336
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,240
Exactly. So Herbalife may be
an industry leader

337
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,120
in worthless crap
people stick in their garage,

338
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,320
along with, of course,
the PT Cruiser,

339
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,960
the car that looks like
a sporty version of a hearse.

340
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,200
As a distributor,
it is not easy to figure out

341
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,720
how you are going
to make money.

342
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,640
Watch this Herbalife
video from a few years ago,

343
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,120
explaining one narrow part of their
convoluted compensation plan.

344
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,800
Okay, here we go:
take a look at this example.

345
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,400
When E places a $4 000 volume
point order at 42 percent,

346
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,960
this counts as personal volume
for you.

347
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:16,560
Since this qualifies E to supervisor,
with a one-month qualification,

348
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,080
that volume now becomes encumbered
for everyone in the upline.

349
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,480
Each upline distributor needs
to accumulate

350
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,080
1 000 un-encumbered
volume points

351
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,800
if they want to qualify
for supervisor, as well.

352
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:36,520
It's simple. And if you accumulate
10 000 un-encumbered volume points,

353
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,320
those are grouped into
an "unencumbered batch",

354
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,680
which qualifies
Benedict Cumberbatch

355
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,320
for one un-encumbered
cucumber cummerbund.

356
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,040
And while yes,
that is absolute nonsense,

357
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,760
it makes exactly as much sense as
everything that came before it.

358
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,640
To hear another former distributor,
your main focus in the business

359
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,800
might be less on products,
than on the people below you.

360
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,400
You don't make money
from selling products.

361
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:08,080
You make a little, not enough to pay
the bills that are racking up.

362
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,440
You make money
from signing people up.

363
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,000
Like that famous salesmanship motto
from Glengarry Glen Ross:

364
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,640
A-B-S-T-C-O-S-T-O-S.

365
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,440
Always Be Selling The Concept
Of Selling To Other Salespeople.

366
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,720
That "pyramid scheme" question
set aside earlier has to be addressed.

367
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,800
If distributors' earnings come
primarily from selling products

368
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,040
to customers outside of the company,
that is probably a legitimate business.

369
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,800
If those earnings come primarily
from selling product

370
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,680
to the distributors
you've recruited below you,

371
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,800
and their sales of product to
the distributors they've recruited,

372
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,320
all within the company,
that may be a pyramid scheme.

373
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,040
And any business that is set up
that way has a big problem,

374
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,320
for a reason that, and I will
warn you, does involve math.

375
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,200
Almost all of these schemes
tell you that you can make money

376
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,200
by just recruiting three
or four or five, let's say.

377
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,520
Then you let the five do their five.
That gives you twenty-five.

378
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,480
What they don't show you is
that you can only do that 13 cycles.

379
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,240
And you would exceed
the population of the Earth.

380
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,480
It's true ! Within fourteen cycles,
you run out of people.

381
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,240
That is assuming that everyone
wants to be a protein shake distributor

382
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,080
and I can think of at least a few
who have better things to do.

383
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,960
Alan Alda, for instance.
Or Malala Yousefzai.

384
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,600
Or Morten Harket,
lead singer of A-Ha.

385
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,840
Still swimming in "Take on Me"
money. He doesn't need this shit.

386
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,600
Herbalife's CEO, Michael Johnson,
has an interesting way

387
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,320
of deflecting that
pyramid scheme question.

388
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,680
I go back to any company.
I started in Disney as a director,

389
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,320
I went to be executive vice president

390
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,960
and then president of the international
entity of the company.

391
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,800
I moved up six or seven levels.
And at the top was sitting

392
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,600
the CEO of the company,
Michael Eisner.

393
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,160
Is that a pyramid ? It's different
than what we're doing ?

394
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:20,080
Yes !
Disney was a corporate ladder !

395
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,920
Those were all salaried
positions with benefits.

396
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,680
The company wasn't banking on
you personally filling your garage

397
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,600
with cases of unsold DVDs of
"The Lion King II: Simba's Pride".

398
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,080
Johnson could've made a stronger
"non-pyramid" case,

399
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,200
if he could've shown
how much money distributors get

400
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,160
from selling product
to actual retail customers.

401
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,440
But Herbalife didn't keep
records of those figures.

402
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,000
The FTC recently finished a multiyear
investigation into the company

403
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,640
and filed a blistering complaint
walking right up to the line

404
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,000
of outright calling it
a pyramid scheme.

405
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,680
They alleged Herbalife's "program
doesn't incentivize retail sales,"

406
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,000
"but the recruiting of additional
participants who fuel the enterprise"

407
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,680
"by making wholesale purchases
of product."

408
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,640
Which sounds like
how pyramid schemes work.

409
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,240
When people pointed this out,
FTC chair made an amazing statement.

410
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,880
It sounds like what you're saying
is that this company

411
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,760
had all the hallmarks
of a pyramid scheme, right ?

412
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,160
Our focus isn't on the label.

413
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,640
The word pyramid
does not appear in our complaint.

414
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,080
Not determined
not to have been a pyramid.

415
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,040
Think about
what she just said there !

416
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,760
Not determined "not" to be a pyramid.
How is that not a huge warning sign ?

417
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,480
If FDA announced

418
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,400
"we have not determined cotton
candy not to be clown pubes",

419
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,440
you would never risk
eating that shit ever again.

420
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,280
Who knows why
the FTC stopped short ?

421
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,440
Perhaps it ensured Herbalife
agreed to a settlement,

422
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,560
in which they neither admitted
nor denied wrongdoing,

423
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,440
but did pay $200 million and
agreed to significant new changes.

424
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,840
The contents of this
complaint are mind-blowing.

425
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,240
The FTC claims that the overwhelming
majority of Herbalife distributors

426
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,680
who pursue the business opportunity
make little or no money

427
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,200
and a substantial percentage
lose money.

428
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,200
The FTC even stated:

429
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,000
"Herbalife is going to have
to start operating legitimately."

430
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,720
Which implies
they hadn't been up till then.

431
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,600
And yet, amazingly, Michael Johnson
characterized this as a victory.

432
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,040
We've got great news.

433
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,240
We've reached an agreement
with the US FTC

434
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,560
that ensures our mission to improve
people's lives will continue to thrive.

435
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,000
This is really good news,
when our business is growing

436
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,440
bigger and better
than ever before.

437
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,320
Fuck you.

438
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:03,160
He didn't just polish that turd,
he put it in a bottle

439
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,800
and convinced people
they could make a fortune

440
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,560
selling nutritional turds
in their spare time.

441
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,520
Whether Herbalife is a pyramid, not
a pyramid, or not "not" a pyramid,

442
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,400
it is true
that Herbalife is growing.

443
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,480
A lot of that growth
come from Latino communities,

444
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,240
where Herbalife has been
expanding for years.

445
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,400
They even bought a sponsorship on
the hit telenovela "La Fea Mas Bella".

446
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,440
It's subtle,
see if you can spot it.

447
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,120
Look. It's called Herbalife.

448
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,280
This is going to help you
have more energy

449
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,000
and it's also going to help you
face all the problems you have.

450
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,400
- Really ?
- I drink it every day. It's delicious.

451
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,040
If that is happening on this show,

452
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,520
I can't imagine the real drama
happening in the commercials.

453
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,520
Mr. Geico Lizard, I want
to save 15% on car insurance,

454
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,360
but how can I when
you are sleeping with my wife ?!

455
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,320
The fact a large percentage of
Herbalife's business comes from Latinos

456
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,720
is a point of pride
for Michael Johnson.

457
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,960
We call it the Herbalife family
and we're not ashamed of that.

458
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,440
The Latino, the blood,
if you will,

459
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,840
it's in this company
and it feels great.

460
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:24,360
I love the blood of the Latino
community. I want to bathe in it.

461
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,120
I wanna bathe in your blood, Latinos.
How's this sales pitch going ?

462
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,320
I feel like it's going bueno.

463
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,760
To those supplying that Latino
blood, it can feel less than great,

464
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,800
as this community meeting of those
who feel burned by Herbalife shows.

465
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:47,680
In this business,
I lost a total of $22 000.

466
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,080
In nine months,
I lost $16 000.

467
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,320
Her husband continuously reminds her
about the $8,000 that she owes to them.

468
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,400
The product expires.
So if you don't get rid of it

469
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,560
and sell it at the price
you bought it, it's a big loss.

470
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,600
She knew
I didn't have that money.

471
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,360
And she was supposed
to be my friend.

472
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,040
When I asked her: "what
happened that I don't see any profit ?"

473
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,320
she said, "you have to put people
under you so that you can profit."

474
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,280
I told her: "You got it wrong.
I'm not going to swindle anyone."

475
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,400
I lost but no one
else is going to lose because of me.

476
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,200
Now might be
a good time to point out:

477
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,640
when someone says: "their blood
is in me, and it feels great,"

478
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,840
that is what
a fucking vampire says.

479
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,440
Friends of yours may say:

480
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,320
"That's just Herbalife.
My MLM is different".

481
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,960
But there are echoes of what
you've seen across this industry.

482
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,480
Herbalife is far
from the only company

483
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,320
that made bold product claims
regarding health.

484
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,280
When I started,
my body fat was 37.5

485
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,280
and now it's right around 16, 17.

486
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,520
The pain and the lethargy that
go along with fibromyalgia is gone.

487
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,680
Three days into the experience,
I was feeling 25 years younger.

488
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,640
When I found out they had a pet
formulation of Liquid BioCell,

489
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,800
I knew
I had something very exclusive.

490
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,680
After putting Rembrandt on
Liquid BioCell pet for three months,

491
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,960
he started walking again.

492
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,160
First of all, obviously:
good boy, Rembrandt.

493
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,520
Second: are you sure he didn't
just summon the energy to walk

494
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,200
because he was desperate to get away
from the liquid nonsense

495
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,600
you were shoving
in your pets' mouths ?

496
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,560
MLMs can
often have scientology-like levels

497
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,200
for you to ascend through.

498
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,320
With Usana, you may've gone
from sharer to believer

499
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,720
to builder to achiever
and beyond.

500
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,120
At Kyani, you pass through a series of
ranks with names of gemstones,

501
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,240
as one distributor explained
at a company conference.

502
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,040
I want to talk about
a millionaire mindset,

503
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,320
because if you got involved
in Kyani to become a jade,

504
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,440
you're selling yourself short.

505
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,400
If you got involved in Kyani
to become a diamond,

506
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,520
you're not thinking
big enough yet.

507
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,960
If you haven't already visualized
yourself a double black diamond,

508
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,160
you need to kick
yourself in the rear.

509
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,480
"Double black diamond"

510
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,200
is technically a skiing term
for particularly dangerous slopes.

511
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,000
Maybe you shouldn't choose
a term that basically says:

512
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,400
"if you even try this, you'll go
downhill and may end up in a ditch."

513
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,440
The "garage qualified" issue
is not exclusive to Herbalife either.

514
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,000
It's come up with multiple other
MLMs, including Mary Kay.

515
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,880
I saw the warehousing
of the product,

516
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,920
meaning they had basements
or closets or garages full of it.

517
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,000
Look ! Inventory from a consultant
who is leaving the company.

518
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,240
She showed us boxes of product
she said she bought to keep her status.

519
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:59,040
So it seems some distributors may've
been more customer than salesperson.

520
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,240
Like finding out Jamie Lee Curtis
was the one eating all the Activia.

521
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,120
I eat 146 containers a day
and I shit like a machine gun !

522
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,600
Mary Kay and Herbalife will tell you
that stockpiling is uncommon

523
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,360
and you can return
unsold product for a refund.

524
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:21,320
Those refunds can be partial
or may involve resigning.

525
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,200
MLMs may present themselves
as a great opportunity,

526
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,800
but your chance of success
is actually remote.

527
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,360
Look at
the income-disclosure statements.

528
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,600
Kyani's shows that under 40 percent
of "active distributors"

529
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,280
received a check for $10 or more,

530
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,840
meaning that most
didn't even make that.

531
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,960
Nu Skin's says around 18% of active
distributors earned commission checks.

532
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:49,080
Which is worse than it sounds,
because "active distributors" represent

533
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,920
only around 36 percent
of total distributors.

534
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
If you do the math,
which they conveniently didn't,

535
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,320
that would mean that 93 percent
of all Nu Skin distributors

536
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,040
receive zero commissions from
the company in an average month.

537
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,240
So even if you have never
heard of Nu Skin before,

538
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:13,040
it may be paying you just as much
as it does 93% of its distributors !

539
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:18,720
MLMs will insist those percentages
are misleading,

540
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,800
that many of their distributors
aren't in the business to make money,

541
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,160
they went to all the trouble
of signing up

542
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,160
to get discounts
on their amazing rhino ejaculate

543
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,160
or, as they call it, soup.

544
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:37,920
They'll say individual distributors,
don't speak for them,

545
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,160
their claims are against company
policies and violators get disciplined.

546
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,720
Most importantly, they will
all insist they are not pyramids.

547
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:50,440
And no one claims that in a more
spectacular manner than JR Ridinger,

548
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,240
who has an air-tight case,

549
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,080
based on "spelling the word
pyramid backwards."

550
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,760
We're actually the anti-pyramid.
The reverse pyramid.

551
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,160
The dimaryp.
We are in a dimaryp !

552
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,760
He sounds like a cult leader about
to demand his followers drink poison.

553
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,200
It doesn't help that he looks like
Jim Jones to a creepy degree.

554
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,920
But it is hard for the FTC
to investigate these companies,

555
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,960
the industry is large and opaque

556
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,720
and pursuing a case is a long,
arduous process.

557
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,040
They've only brought around two dozen
pyramid scheme cases against MLMs

558
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,720
in the last four decades.

559
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:38,560
MLMs have lobbying strength, there's
a direct selling caucus in congress,

560
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,720
with more than 40 bipartisan members,
including Jason Chaffetz,

561
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,720
who worked at Nu Skin
for more than a decade.

562
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,960
Herbalife has gone to remarkable
lengths to protect its name.

563
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:55,520
It's recruited two former top FTC
officials to work for the company.

564
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,640
It's willing to be petty. Remember
that clip of Herbalife victims ?

565
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,160
That is from an upcoming documentary
called "Betting on Zero"

566
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,440
and when it played at
a DC film festival earlier this year,

567
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,920
the screening
had 173 empty seats,

568
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,360
because an Herbalife lobbying firm
reportedly bought them out.

569
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,360
And that's not just petty,
it's stupid.

570
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,120
If you don't want people to see
a movie, don't buy out seats.

571
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,280
Put up posters saying
"starring Shia LaBeouf". Job done !

572
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,200
Nobody's there !

573
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,120
Even if the government did decide
to crack down on this industry,

574
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,280
many MLMs have been
expanding overseas.

575
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,280
Here is a video from India.

576
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,480
We change people's lives.

577
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,160
- You are the brand.
- We are growing every day.

578
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,520
Let's march toward one million,
one billion, one region.

579
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,440
They are lucky Gandhi isn't alive
to hear that song

580
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,360
because it would really test his
belief in non-violent protests.

581
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,800
"Fuck it. Everybody pick up a rock
and meet me at Herbalife headquarters"

582
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,920
"that song was unforgivable."

583
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,520
Online you can find videos of gigantic
Herbalife events around the world:

584
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,360
here is one in South Africa,
here is one in Mongolia,

585
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,320
here's one in Venezuela,
here's one in Malaysia,

586
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,600
and here is Michael Johnson
in Mexico, doing this.

587
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,440
Buenos dias, Mexico !

588
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,600
I don't say this lightly,

589
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,320
but that is douchebaggery
at a double black diamond level.

590
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:48,360
What can we do ?
Good, hard-working people

591
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,400
are going to keep getting caught up
in these companies.

592
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,240
There has to be a way to tell
the world about the dangers of MLMs.

593
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,880
I might know the perfect
distribution network.

594
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:03,200
That is why tonight, we are
starting our own pyramid scheme,

595
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,080
hashtag
"this is a pyramid scheme."

596
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,600
If someone you know is thinking
about joining an MLM,

597
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,360
this is a huge opportunity.

598
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,360
And let me show you
how it works...

599
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,760
I want to tell you
about a fantastic product

600
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,280
for you to share
with friends and family.

601
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,760
The product is this entire video
about why MLMs are awful.

602
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,680
Let me break it down for you.
By sharing this,

603
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,200
you can be an independent distributor
for a leading web video

604
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,920
about the dangers of MLMs.

605
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,320
You can do this full-time
or part-time

606
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,080
and give your family
the lifestyle they deserve

607
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,280
which is not getting caught up
in this bullshit.

608
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,120
Need scientific proof
that it works ?

609
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,560
We told a dog we were going
to produce this video and look !

610
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,560
The dog is walking now !

611
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,000
Was it able to walk before ?
We don't keep those records.

612
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,440
Here is how it works:
watch this video

613
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,840
and then forward it to five people,
and then instruct them

614
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,560
to send it to another five people,
and so on.

615
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,240
Within fourteen cycles, every
person on Earth will have seen this,

616
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,480
we will need to start fucking to
create more people to watch it.

617
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,560
If every single person on Earth
is watching this video...

618
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,920
Hello, BeyoncÃ©.
I'm a really big fan.

619
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,200
Like MLMs, we would like to direct
a message to Latinos in particular.

620
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,760
We will be uploading two versions
of this segment to YouTube

621
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,200
with one in Spanish.

622
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,400
Because I do not speak Spanish,
it will be subtitled,

623
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,320
and this portion will be performed by
Jaime Camil, from "Jane the Virgin".

624
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,360
- Hola, Jaime.
- Hola, Juan.

625
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,400
You are clearly a more attractive
version of me in every way !

626
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,880
Yes, I am.

627
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,800
Share this video to stop people getting
involved with these schemes,

628
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,720
MLMs are hurting people

629
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,920
and we need to spread
the word about their dangers.

630
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,640
- Send this to twenty people.
- 30 people, 100 people !

631
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,520
What are you waiting for ?
This system will work.

632
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,960
And it is not a dimaryp.
It's an anti-dimaryp.

633
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,120
- This is a pyramid, right ?
- Right ! This is a pyramid !

634
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,720
We are in a pyramid !

635
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,880
That's our show !
Share this video !

636
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,320
We'll see you next week,
good night !

637
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,280
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

638
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,400
END OF EPISODE 29,
SEASON III
