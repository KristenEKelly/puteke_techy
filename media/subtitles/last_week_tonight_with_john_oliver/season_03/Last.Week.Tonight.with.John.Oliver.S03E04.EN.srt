LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,840
SEASON III
EPISODE 4

3
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,680
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,920
Thank you so much for joining us.
Time for a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,240
And we begin with the U.S. election.
Or as you may know it,

6
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,400
the "Clowntown Fuckthe-World
Shitshow 2016."

7
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,720
This was a particularly big week
for the Republican Party,

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,000
with Donald Trump winning
seven states on Super Tuesday.

9
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,840
Two more last night. While yesterday's
wins were a little narrower,

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,400
it does appear that republican
voters have, for the time being,

11
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,760
decided not to make
Donald Drumpf again.

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,800
Hashtag
make Donald Drumpf again.

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,680
In fact, Trump's opponents spent the
week seeming increasingly desperate.

14
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,760
He's always calling me little Marco.

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,480
He is taller than me, he's like 6'2",
which is why I don't understand

16
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,200
why his hands
are the size of someone who's 5'2".

17
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,840
Have you seen his hands ?
They're like this.

18
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,240
And you know what they say
about men with small hands.

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,880
You can't trust 'em.

20
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,800
No, that is not what they say
about men with small hands.

21
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,400
And if you can't say the word "penis",
don't imply the word penis.

22
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,840
It's not even an insult,
it's a Christian rock lyric.

23
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,720
Even as primary voters embrace Trump,
the republican establishment

24
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,480
is rejecting him
like a transplanted organ.

25
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,760
Which is fitting,

26
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,560
as Trump does resemble a kidney
dropped on the floor at a Supercuts.

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,880
But to truly reject an organ
you need white blood cells,

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,240
and the GOP called up
the whitest blood cell of them all.

29
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,000
Donald Trump tells us
that he is very, very smart.

30
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,800
I'm afraid that when it comes
to foreign policy

31
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,400
he is very, very not smart.

32
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,040
Okay. And that is very, very
not a very good insult.

33
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,240
But Romney wasn't alone.
Prominent republicans

34
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,760
lined up to publicly attack
their own party's frontrunner.

35
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,520
I hope we aren't faced

36
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,680
with the possibility
of having Mr. Trump as our nominee.

37
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,320
I cannot vote for him,
and I will not.

38
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,280
If we nominate Donald Trump,

39
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,800
republicans will be committing
an abortion on their own party

40
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,040
and it will be the end
of the Republican Party as we know it.

41
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,560
Holy shit !
You know they're getting desperate

42
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,880
when they're just throwing
in their favorite buzzwords.

43
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,760
"He won't just be an abortion.
He'll be a Sharia law,

44
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,320
wrapped in a Benghazi-themed
gay wedding."

45
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,360
And I mean it. I'm not
understating that. I mean it.

46
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,800
But, not surprisingly,
Trump hit back hard at his critics,

47
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,360
with his tiny, hamster-sized fists,
during Thursday's debate.

48
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,200
He referred to my hands: if they are
small, something else must be small.

49
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,720
I guarantee you there is no problem.

50
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,280
Donald Trump talked about his dick
during a presidential debate.

51
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,240
A dick which I presume looks like a
Cheeto with the cheese dust rubbed off.

52
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,840
I presume, that's a guess.
But you know what ?

53
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,320
I'm glad he brought it up.
Mainly because I now have an excuse

54
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,200
to play you something that we didn't
have time to include last week:

55
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,840
an audiobook excerpt from his
exwife Ivana's "For Love Alone",

56
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,760
a barely fictionalized
account of their marriage,

57
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,480
as read by Morgan Fairchild.

58
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,440
In a moment, they were on the floor,
on top of the mink coat,

59
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,640
Katrinka's legs gripping his waist as
he moved deeper and deeper into her.

60
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,560
As Adam pulled away from her,

61
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,880
his cock fell for a moment
into the valley between her legs,

62
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,280
leaving a smear of semen
on the dark silk.

63
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,480
He smiled with satisfaction.

64
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,800
"Now you have to keep the coat",
he said.

65
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,800
That is horrible.
Although you can't say

66
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,600
jazzing all over your girlfriend's
clothes is not presidential.

67
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,440
You can't say that.

68
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,960
The Republican Party wasn't doing
damage control at the national level.

69
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,440
A number of local elections
also threw up terrifying results.

70
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,800
Just look at Texas,
the Lone Star State.

71
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,400
In that a lone star is what most
people would give Texas on Yelp.

72
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,440
This week,
voters in Travis County, Texas,

73
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,840
voted for a republican chairman,
and look who they picked.

74
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,560
Real anger after a man republicans
consider to be vulgar and brash

75
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,360
just won control of their party
in Travis County.

76
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm politically incorrect. I'm like
Donald Trump on steroids, sweetheart.

77
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,800
Get ready to have fun
reading my Twitter feed.

78
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,680
That guy's overall look
can only be described as:

79
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,760
"Guy kicked out of your gym
for trying to smell women."

80
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,680
Although, in his defense, I will say:
he is not overselling his Twitter feed.

81
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,120
Because in just the 48 hours after
his election, he actually tweeted,

82
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,320
"I am the face
of the Re-pube-licking Party",

83
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,000
and "I like boobies".

84
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,520
Which is still nothing compared
to my favorite tweet of his:

85
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,880
If you Google "Robert Morrow
11 inch penis confirmed",

86
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,760
you get over 11,800,000 hits.
I'm just sayin.'

87
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:53,560
Which is not true. Because we did it,
and we only got 472,000 hits.

88
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,840
Although, if you Google "Robert Morrow
1 inch penis confirmed",

89
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,400
the results go up by 150,000,
but that's not the point.

90
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,680
The point is, this guy
is now an actual elected official,

91
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,480
Chair of the Travis County
Republican Party. This guy...

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,880
Do you think Hillary Clinton
would swallow your cum

93
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,960
or would it be more
of a Lorena Bobbett type situation ?

94
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,560
George W. Bush is like Rick Perry.
Both of them are closet homosexuals.

95
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,160
George Herbert Walker Bush

96
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,080
was being provided young teen boys
to have sex with.

97
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,880
I think Barack Obama
is a gay man that got married.

98
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,680
Bill Clinton, serial rapist.

99
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,640
Hillary Clinton,
rampaging bisexual adulterer.

100
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,280
Rick Perry,
rampaging bisexual adulterer.

101
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,800
Yes. That all sounds appalling.

102
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,440
But to be fair,
the question he was asked was:

103
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,040
"What sounds does Ann Coulter
make as she falls down the stairs."

104
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,360
So with that context,
he's not entirely wrong.

105
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,160
He wasn't the only candidate

106
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,800
to embarrass
the Republican Party in Texas.

107
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,120
Let me introduce you
to Mary Lou Bruner,

108
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,120
a woman who,
based on her jacket,

109
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,800
I can assume was a member
of the 1996 women's gymnastics team.

110
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,320
Is she Kerri Strug ?
I think she's Kerri Strug.

111
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,440
She is running
a successful campaign

112
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,200
for a place on the
Texas State Board of Education.

113
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,320
So let's find out
some more about her.

114
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,680
Bruner has recently
come under fire online

115
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,880
for some passionately stated opinions
she holds, including the idea

116
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,840
that global warming was made up
to promote global socialism

117
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,520
and that President Obama paid
for a drug addiction in his twenties

118
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,600
through homosexual prostitution.

119
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,280
How do people think that people
on welfare who also have a drug habit,

120
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,000
how do they think they pay
for their drugs ?

121
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,600
They steal,
they prostitute themselves.

122
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,960
Say what you will about her !

123
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,640
I would read any history textbook
she had a part in creating.

124
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,120
"Teddy Roosevelt fathered
an illegitimate child

125
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,560
that was half-human, half-bear ?
Why did nobody tell me this ?

126
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,120
Education is fun !
I yearn to learn !"

127
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,760
The Texas state Board of Education

128
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,920
is not known for having the least
controversial personnel in the country.

129
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,440
But she seems extreme,
even for them.

130
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,960
She's previously written that
the dinosaurs were on Noah's ark,

131
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,760
but went extinct afterward,
because and I quote,

132
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,720
"They may have been babies
and not able to reproduce.

133
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,000
It might make sense to take
the small dinosaurs onto the ark

134
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,240
instead of the ones bigger
than a bus."

135
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,600
Which is clearly
scientifically wrong.

136
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,360
We don't have dinosaurs not because
they were too small to have sex,

137
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,760
but because
nobody fucks on a cruise.

138
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,080
The dinosaurs were probably
too full from the buffet.

139
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,240
Crack a book, lady !
Crack a science book !

140
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,160
Republicans were quick to distance
themselves from both candidates.

141
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,400
A current school board member saying:
Bruner would be "a human rain delay",

142
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,520
and the Texas governor's office
issuing the statement,

143
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,960
"Robert Morrow in no way speaks for
the Republican Party or its values".

144
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,480
But doesn't he, though ?
Because in this election cycle,

145
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,120
it'd be a lot easier to argue
that your party shouldn't be judged

146
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,280
by people who spread weird
Obama conspiracy theories

147
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,080
and brag about their dicks
if that didn't also accurately describe

148
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,800
your presumptive nominee
for the presidency.

149
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,560
It's a weird election time
we're going through.

150
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,840
So let's move on to Lands End.
The clothing company so boring,

151
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,560
its name is literally synonymous
with water.

152
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,080
The Lands End catalog has become
the source of an unexpected scandal.

153
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,080
The retailer known
for glossy catalogues like this one

154
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,440
apologizing for what's inside
the new spring issue;

155
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,120
an interview with feminist, journalist,
and political activist Gloria Steinem.

156
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,560
Yes, people were upset
over a Gloria Steinem interview,

157
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,960
which featured
such incendiary quotes as,

158
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,160
"dreams are bigger than goals",
"each person is a unique miracle",

159
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,360
and "Lands' End is helping people
become themselves."

160
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,920
Which is absurd.

161
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,160
The only way Lands' End
helps people "become themselves"

162
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,480
is by providing
a visual expression of rock bottom.

163
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,680
Because that is a puffy coat
with lapels. Fucking lapels !

164
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,760
It's a puffy blazer !

165
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,840
If you see a loved one wearing that,
don't just stand there, comfort them.

166
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,320
It's a cry for help !
They're reaching out !

167
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,840
What upset some customers

168
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,160
wasn't so much Steinem's interview,
as one of her beliefs.

169
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,920
To do a feature
on a pro-abortion feminist.

170
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,800
Why would you do that ?

171
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,600
Pro-life customers promising
to boycott the business.

172
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,640
The company apologized
to customers who were offended

173
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,240
and it has removed Steinem
from its website.

174
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,720
Lands End says its goal was to feature
people who have made a difference

175
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,480
and not to take a political
or religious stance.

176
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,560
Apologizing for the interview
is taking a political stance.

177
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,040
If you didn't want to be religious,
stop making your clothes

178
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,160
look like they're designed
for Mormon spring break.

179
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,040
In an amazing added twist,
Steinem supporters

180
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,160
are now threatening
to boycott the company as well.

181
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,440
I guess, congratulations Lands End:
with one pointless interview

182
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,400
which incidentally,
didn't even mention abortion

183
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,600
you've pissed off everyone
involved in the abortion debate.

184
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,840
I don't know how you did it. But since
you are apologizing about things,

185
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,040
how about apologizing for this shirt

186
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,200
designed to look
like the blueprints of a sailboat ?

187
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,240
Or whatever the fuck this is ?

188
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,040
It looks like something an ER nurse
would wear to a book burning.

189
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,040
Or maybe apologize
for this beige sweater vest,

190
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,480
which, and this is a fact,
you legally are not allowed to own

191
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,240
unless you're a middle school
viceprincipal.

192
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,720
That's a legal fact.

193
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,400
But I guess it does make sense
that Lands End backed down here.

194
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,040
Because they know that if a woman
truly has the right to choose,

195
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,240
the first thing she'll choose to do

196
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,800
is to shop somewhere else
than Lands End.

197
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,440
And now this !

198
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,640
And now people on TV
mean "fucking".

199
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,880
A new study out says women
are more attracted to wide faced men.

200
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,080
Not to marry though, just to...

201
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,480
Go to Poughkeepsie.

202
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,960
You mean fucking.

203
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,440
Viagra for men, it's not just
for the men if you know what I mean.

204
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,000
Yeah, you mean fucking.

205
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,920
She said they lost it having
a little honeymoon fun,

206
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,320
if you know what I mean.

207
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
Fucking, you mean fucking.

208
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,120
The only thing the guys do
of any value involving children

209
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,280
is getting the process started.

210
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,920
You mean fucking.
Fucking to completion.

211
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,760
If you're a husband
who likes to help your wife out,

212
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,080
it may not pay off,
if you know what I mean.

213
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,920
Less sex.

214
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,960
They're giving it to you,
but then they're giving it to you.

215
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,520
You mean getting fucked.

216
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,320
He wants to sew wild oats,
if you know what I mean.

217
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,400
Yes, fucking.

218
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,360
It all starts with a banana,
if you know what I mean.

219
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,200
A penis. For fucking.

220
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,880
You have to heat it up
in different ways !

221
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,120
Fucking !

222
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,840
Why don't you just get yourself
a nice dickie ?

223
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,040
I don't know what you mean.

224
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,680
She means fucking.
She always mean fucking.

225
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,400
Moving on.

226
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,440
Our main story tonight concerns
government. Sports for nerds.

227
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,040
These days, we are all focused
on the presidential race

228
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,760
the most prominent office
in all of government.

229
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,760
But I would like to talk
about one of the smallest

230
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,280
and most obscure forms
of government: special districts.

231
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,200
Tonight, we are talking
about special taxing districts.

232
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,640
Hello people watching
because of our Trump piece.

233
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,800
Also, I presume, goodbye.
Goodbye. Thanks for checking in.

234
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,680
Just so you know: special districts
are small units of government

235
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,120
with the power to take tax dollars
to do one specific thing.

236
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,040
You've heard
of a fire district or a water district.

237
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,520
But they can be set up
for almost any purpose,

238
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,040
and there are way more
of them than you think.

239
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,640
Special districts
have really proliferated

240
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,640
to the point that we have
about 40,000 in the country,

241
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,880
and they account
for 100 billion dollars of spending.

242
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,200
$100 billion a year.

243
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,200
That is $16 billion more
than Russia spends on its military.

244
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,320
And special districts

245
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,040
are the most common form
of local government in the country.

246
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,040
It's like finding out the highest-paid
athlete in the world is Harold.

247
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,280
I mean, who the fuck is Harold ?
What sport does he play ?

248
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,960
Why don't people talk about this
all the time ?

249
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,600
How am I only hearing
about Harold now ?

250
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,320
You're making me feel a fool.

251
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,640
Special districts are so ubiquitous,
and have so little accountability,

252
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,360
states may not even know how many
they have or how much they spend.

253
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,080
Idaho launched an investigation
of special districts,

254
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,040
with objective one: "identify how many
special districts there are in Idaho."

255
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,160
When Kentucky investigated,
its auditor found

256
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,560
that 40% of its districts
didn't even file proper budgets.

257
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,800
This is an extraordinary mess.
As one of my good friends says:

258
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,440
"You can't make this up !"

259
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,800
$2.7 billion system of government

260
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,320
operating because of a lack
of oversight and accountability

261
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,680
has been permitted to become
a level of ghost government.

262
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,360
Yes, ghost government. The shittiest
idea for a ghost story I've heard,

263
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,280
aside from "Ghost Dad".

264
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,760
That was a bad idea before context
changed the way we felt

265
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,200
about Bill Cosby
walking through walls.

266
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,800
Before then it was a bad idea,
after it was horrifying.

267
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:54,960
It's weird, in a country that talks so
much about government accountability

268
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,880
that our tax dollars fund entities
that most of us know nothing about.

269
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,720
You may not even know how many
districts you are living in now.

270
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,120
A school district may overlap
with a park district, a water district

271
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,920
such that it wouldn't be uncommon
for one person to find themselves

272
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,400
within the boundaries
of ten districts.

273
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,960
Right. Think of
a special district like a cult.

274
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,000
It can take your money and you may
not be aware you are in one.

275
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,680
Allowing the leader to impregnate you
is not mandatory,

276
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,720
no matter what the guy in
the library district says.

277
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,400
No matter what he says
with his words or eyes.

278
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,560
If you are thinking: "what difference
does it make what districts I'm in ?"

279
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,800
It can actually make
a big difference.

280
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:49,080
One person paid $1 000 as part
of an irrigation special district

281
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,520
that he lives in
in North Central Phoenix,

282
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,000
his neighbor across the street
is not a part of that district.

283
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,280
Their special district bill was $7.
1 000 versus 7 dollars.

284
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,600
The only people who should be paying
$1 000 more than their neighbors

285
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,880
are the assholes who cover their
house with Christmas decorations.

286
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,680
They should be taxed
and then imprisoned.

287
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,840
Then told their
lights "were better last year",

288
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,200
because it's that one that
would hurt them the most.

289
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,120
In theory and often in practice

290
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,760
having small entities with a single
purpose can be a great idea.

291
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,840
Take Litchfield, New Hampshire.

292
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,840
In 2007, they chose to create
a "mosquito control district"

293
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,000
to control mosquitos.

294
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,960
It's run by two men, who
as you will see from an YouTube video

295
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,800
are heartbreakingly conscientious,

296
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,240
regardless of the fact that
there is no one else in the room.

297
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,520
Let's all stand
for the pledge of allegiance.

298
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,640
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America

299
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,120
and to the republic for which
it stands, one nation under God,

300
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,320
indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.

301
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,920
Chair will call the roll.
Acting Vice Chair Mr. Raccio.

302
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,080
- Present.
- I'm here. All members are present.

303
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,480
You have got to admire
their dedication to the rules.

304
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,000
These two are so scrupulous, they
would sit at a broken red traffic light

305
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,560
for six hours
in the middle of the night.

306
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,760
Red is red. We live in a civilized
society. Red is red, we stay.

307
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,720
They ran that 43-minute
meeting so meticulously,

308
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,400
they even took input from the public
with predictable results.

309
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,200
Any members of the public
wishing to speak ?

310
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,440
Seeing and hearing none.

311
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,240
When you're a member
of a ghost government,

312
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,320
it's natural your meetings are going
to be attended by the ghost public.

313
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,560
That is the best-case scenario.
Many special districts are like that

314
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,600
chugging along just fine,
with no major problems.

315
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,280
But some, like the Isaacson Municipal
Utility District in Texas, are not.

316
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,960
An audit recently discovered
$70 000 in losses

317
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,360
and the district billed residents for
water with a disturbing consistency.

318
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,120
We're not
accountants or managers.

319
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,760
We may not have looked at things
as closely as we should've.

320
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:38,120
IMUD has been billed
for 13,721,200 gallons of water

321
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,640
every year for six years,

322
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,200
rain or drought or weather,
no change, same number.

323
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,400
No charges have been filed,
but that consistency is weird.

324
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,720
The only time the same amount
of water should appear in a document

325
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,160
is in Shamu's rider.

326
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,680
Yeah, Shamu gets 13.7 million gallons
of water in his tank at all times !

327
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,120
He's a fucking artist !
I'm obviously kidding.

328
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,760
You can keep him in a wading pool.
If you wanna fuck his blowhole,

329
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,400
that will be an extra twenty,
thanks for visiting Sea World !

330
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,000
In Kentucky, the lack of supervision
led to outright corruption

331
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:24,600
with $100 000 being misspent by
one former assistant fire chief.

332
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:30,640
The Garrett Volunteer Fire Department
in Floyd County used taxpayer money

333
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,560
to buy flat screen televisions,
chewing tobacco and fireworks.

334
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:40,800
Investigators found pornographic
videos on department electronics.

335
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,600
Porn and chewing tobacco
are obviously inappropriate,

336
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,120
but you know what
upsets me the most there ?

337
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,360
"Fireworks."
They're a fire department.

338
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,840
That's like EMTs used their
budget to stage scissor races.

339
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,760
They're your natural enemy !

340
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,760
That was nothing compared to
what happened in Rhode Island.

341
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,960
You won't believe the undercover video
we gathered on the man in charge.

342
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,640
Drinking during the day, then driving
the department vehicle to work.

343
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,920
We have him taking
the public safety vehicle to party up,

344
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,400
drinking and smoking marijuana.

345
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,160
This is you, smoking
what looks to be pot.

346
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,600
A cigar maybe ?

347
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,760
You then share the cigar
with your friends, there ?

348
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
- I don't know.
- That's a cigar ?

349
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,200
Yes, it is.

350
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,200
No one's gonna buy that.

351
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,960
No, but I'm pretty sure
they'll buy it. That's a cigar.

352
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,760
Just like that's flour for when
you wanna bake one tiny cookie.

353
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,640
That's honey for my tea.
I use a very specific amount.

354
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,120
And that's just some quartz I keep
laying around. I love quartz.

355
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,480
Corruption is not unique
to special districts.

356
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,560
There are problems in all other
forms of government.

357
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,240
But when special districts
only have one job,

358
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,360
it makes it all the more noticeable
when things go wrong.

359
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,360
Take Evergreen Park, Illinois.

360
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,920
The county it's in has four
mosquito abatement districts,

361
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,920
to prevent the spread
of West Nile,

362
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,600
so it had to be humiliating
when this happened:

363
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,480
Mayor of suburban Evergreen
Park came down with West Nile virus.

364
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,200
The mayor got fucking West Nile !

365
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,000
No one is expecting a zero
percent failure rate here,

366
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,960
but if you're surrounded by that many
mosquito abatement districts,

367
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,160
shouldn't there at least be agents
willing to take a mosquito for him ?

368
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,840
One of the most interesting ways
that special districts are different

369
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,920
is how they can be created seemingly
out of thin air.

370
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,240
In Conroe, Texas, a company
was hoping to create

371
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,600
a new neighborhood
on undeveloped land.

372
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,400
They wanted to form a special district
which could issue bonds.

373
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,280
The law required a vote.
But no one lived there yet.

374
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,000
So guess what they did ?

375
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,560
Tim Kellerman saw someone installing
a mobile home next to his house,

376
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,480
he asked them what's going on.

377
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,640
He told me
it's none of my business.

378
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,720
This man and his wife signed a nine
month lease with Stingray Services.

379
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,080
After that,
he said they're moving out.

380
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,440
They're the only two people
who can vote

381
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,280
on $500 million dollars worth of
bonds for the new housing project.

382
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,280
Two people voting for $500 million
of bonds and then leaving.

383
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,280
It's as if Simba's father
looked out over the plains and said:

384
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,640
"Son, someday this will all be
someone else's problem".

385
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,200
And they both fucked off
and never came back.

386
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,280
And that process is legal.
This wasn't the only place

387
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,280
where Stingray Services provided
what they called

388
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,000
"turn-key voter
trailer election services."

389
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,680
They once even advertised
on Craigslist, with an ad reading:

390
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,320
eligible tenants will vote in
and serve as election officials

391
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,440
for the Election which takes
place in the home.

392
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,760
You're not just the only voters,
you're the election officials

393
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,160
and your trailer
is the polling station.

394
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,680
You wonder why they didn't throw in
bullshit ballot initiatives for fun.

395
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,000
On the motion that Jenna start
cleaning out her hairbrush

396
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,120
because it's starting to look like
we have a cat, we're tied one-to-one.

397
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,280
Once a special district is created,

398
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,520
you can be sure no one is going
to be watching what you do.

399
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,800
Remember that
New Hampshire video ?

400
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,600
When we found it on YouTube,
it had zero views. Zero !

401
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,920
Those two guys themselves
didn't even watch it.

402
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,200
That is anti-viral, as videos go.

403
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,160
Voter accountability is
pretty unlikely, too.

404
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,720
One county in New York found
turnout rates for some elections

405
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,120
could be as low as 1.8 percent.

406
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:56,640
Because that county held one
election every 10.9 business days,

407
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,960
with not a single one
taking place on Election Day.

408
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,520
Which seems inherently suspicious.
It would be a bit of a red flag

409
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:11,960
if someone offered children candy every
11 days, but never on Halloween.

410
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,440
It would give you
pause for thought.

411
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,720
If the state government
does investigate,

412
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,800
special districts blow them off.

413
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,360
When that Kentucky auditor
asked his state's districts

414
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,440
about making their information
public, he got unhelpful responses.

415
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,760
Here's one, direct quote, we didn't
take any liberties with these.

416
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,320
This contains information
the public is not entitled to know.

417
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,720
We don't want to fill this out

418
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,560
because there are too many
crack pots in the world.

419
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,000
And my favorite, we'd rather
the public contact us directly

420
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,040
to gain information
so we know who's asking.

421
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,920
You get the sense
their preferred mode of contact

422
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,760
would be an email to fake
email address at fuck off dot gov.

423
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,800
If, after hearing that, Kentuckians
wanted to shut a district down,

424
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,200
they might not be able to,
because, as that auditor wrote:

425
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:13,160
"many districts may exist because
there's not a process to be dissolved."

426
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,600
There's no way to break them up.
They're like Styrofoam packing peanuts

427
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,040
or the enduring friendship of
Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake.

428
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,520
They'll be with us
until the end of time.

429
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,680
Some states are pushing
to reform special districts.

430
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,320
California has made them far more
transparent in recent years.

431
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,480
An association in San Diego launched
a competition for schoolchildren

432
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,960
to create a one-minute
video educating the public

433
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,120
about "what's so special
about special districts ?"

434
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,040
The deadline was Tuesday
and it had a $1 500 top prize.

435
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,720
I know that 'cause we entered
with some local school kids.

436
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,040
And this is the result:

437
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,720
Today's top story, special districts !
What's so special about them ?

438
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,760
Special districts collect taxes
to handle one specific service.

439
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,880
Like fight fire. Or provide water.
Or buy fireworks or smoke cigars.

440
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,480
Special districts
can receive little oversight.

441
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,760
They're called
ghost governments.

442
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,240
I used to be afraid of ghosts.
But now ? I'm afraid of girls.

443
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,080
Special districts can also
be very easy to create.

444
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:30,320
Sometimes the only people voting for
them are two people in a trailer.

445
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,760
Made by two people
in a trailer in an empty fieldý

446
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,240
Sounds like my younger brother.
True, Declan, you weren't wanted !

447
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,920
Sometimes, special districts
aren't so special.

448
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,160
Like when the mayor of a village
with four mosquito spraying districts

449
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,720
got the West Nile Virus.

450
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,000
Come on !

451
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,440
That would barely be acceptable
if your town were near the Nile.

452
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,840
A river you think so little about,

453
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,680
you don't even realize
that's not the Nile !

454
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,320
This is the Nile.

455
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:06,000
But perhaps the most special part
is how hard it is to get rid of them.

456
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,520
They're almost impossible to destroy.
Like Wolverine !

457
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,400
Even Superman
couldn't destroy Wolverine !

458
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,040
They would never meet
because that's crossing universes.

459
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,360
Special districts take our money
and do whatever they want with it

460
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,520
with little to no consequences.

461
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,800
When I grow up,
I want to be a special district.

462
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,280
And now, this.

463
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,720
That's our show, thank you for
watching. See you next week !

464
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,280
I used to be afraid of ghosts,
but now I'm afraid of girls.

465
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,880
I used to be afraid of ghosts,
but now I'm afraid of girls.

466
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,400
Even Superman
couldn't destroy Wolverine.

467
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,240
That would bearly be acceptable
if your town were near the Nile.

468
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,080
That's not the Nile.
This is the Nile right here.

469
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:09,720
You know it's true Declan.
You weren't wanted.

470
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,800
END OF EPISODE 4,
SEASON III
