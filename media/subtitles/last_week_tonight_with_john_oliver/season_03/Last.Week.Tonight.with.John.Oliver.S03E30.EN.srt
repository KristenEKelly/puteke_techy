LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,600
SEASON III
EPISODE 30

3
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,240
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !

4
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,080
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

5
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,680
Let us begin with our first
and only story: the 2016 election.

6
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,840
As you may know it: "Now that
it's over I wish it was still going on"

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,520
"'cause it turns out the ending
is even worse" 20-fucking-16."

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,200
The results on Tuesday
were a little different

9
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,720
than what just
over half the voters wanted.

10
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,600
We can project the winner
of the presidential race.

11
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,160
Donald Trump wins the presidency.

12
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,400
Donald J. Trump will become the 45th
president of the United States.

13
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,800
It's true ! That happened !

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,560
Instead of showing our daughters
that they could be president,

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,320
America proved
that no grandpa is too racist

16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,600
to become
the leader of the free world.

17
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,480
"Look, Papa !
Someday that could be you !"

18
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,480
If you are like me, the implications
have been hitting you in waves.

19
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,040
One minute you're numb,
the next you realize that Donald Trump,

20
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,320
this man, will soon have access
to the nuclear codes.

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,840
Then you get distracted by daily life,
until it hits you again:

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,880
our future president was supported
by a former grand wizard of the Klan,

23
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,680
and 60 million people
voted for him despite that.

24
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,160
And then maybe you manage
to get some sleep.

25
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,840
But then you wake up realizing
"Shit ! The Supreme Court !"

26
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,200
Because remember Merrick Garland ?

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,320
Who the Republicans have refused
to confirm all year ?

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,880
The guy whom we asked you to choose
a Supreme Court dog for ?

29
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,080
You picked this one, by the way.
We never announced it,

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,800
because we figured that we would
tell you when he was confirmed.

31
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,080
He's not getting confirmed,
and that dog is dead now.

32
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,040
Not really. She's fine.
But she's not getting on the court.

33
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,080
Donald Trump will fill that seat.
And maybe more.

34
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,320
Ruth Bader Ginsburg is in her 80s,
Anthony Kennedy is, is over 80.

35
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,800
There are other justices who've talked,
bandied about the idea of retiring.

36
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,160
Donald Trump is going to shape
the Supreme Court for decades.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,600
That is one of those phrases you
assumed you would never have to hear.

38
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,000
Like "Vanilla Ice is picking up
his Nobel Prize in physics"

39
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,280
or "Henry Kissinger just came out
with a line of skinny jeans."

40
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,680
They go with everything.

41
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,240
It has been wave after
wave of nausea all week.

42
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,160
I woke up on Thursday
feeling fractionally better,

43
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,520
but then I saw Trump in the oval office
with President Obama.

44
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,200
Look at the president's face !

45
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,520
He cannot believe
what he's looking at, either.

46
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,840
In fact, just listen
to the actual audio in that room.

47
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,960
Fun fact: that is the new
national anthem now. You see ?

48
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,520
We're laughing ! We're having fun !
And then you remember:

49
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,160
Trump's going to be in
charge of the military

50
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,800
and leaders there
do not know what to expect.

51
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,080
They have seen Donald Trump's
statements on the campaign trail,

52
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,280
talking about waterboarding, bombing
with no regard to civilian casualties

53
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,480
talking about taking the oil in Iraq.

54
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,360
These things potentially very serious
violations of international law,

55
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,680
violations of the Geneva Convention.

56
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,160
Yes: our president-elect
has at various times

57
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,200
said he'd bomb civilians,
loot oil, and waterboard,

58
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,640
which isn't a military strategy
so much as the series of words

59
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,920
that Donald Rumsfeld mutters so he
can stay hard while he's masturbating.

60
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,120
And, look !
Trump won this election.

61
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,720
By which I mean he won
the Electoral College,

62
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,160
which, for reasons I will never
understand, is how things are done.

63
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,920
And many people,
it's important to remember,

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,400
many people are happy
to see him in office.

65
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,120
Some voters think he'll bring jobs back,
and shake up Washington.

66
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,120
Others are happy
because he isn't Hillary Clinton.

67
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,560
And others, of course,
are Vladimir Putin and Scott Baio.

68
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,960
But for the rest of us, we are faced
with the same questions

69
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,200
as a guy that woke up the day
after a Vegas bachelor party,

70
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,880
deep in the desert, naked,
tied to a cactus and a dead clown.

71
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,800
Namely:
"how the fuck did we get here ?"

72
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,200
And:
"what the fuck do we do now ?"

73
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,520
Because Donald Trump
will be president.

74
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,480
And respecting democracy
means accepting that.

75
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,000
Although there is one sentiment that I
would argue takes that a little too far.

76
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,240
The man hasn't even been
a president for a day yet.

77
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,360
- Let's give him a chance !
- Give Donald Trump a chance.

78
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,720
We have to give him a chance.

79
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,160
The people should give him a chance
because if he succeeds we succeed.

80
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,560
Now, in the broadest sense,
I get that impulse.

81
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,640
Hope for the best
in the face of very long odds.

82
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,680
It's like we're on a plane and we just
found out our pilot is a wombat.

83
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,080
I don't like this,
I don't understand how it happened,

84
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,800
and I'm pretty sure
we're headed for disaster,

85
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,720
but what the hell:
come on, Batty, prove me wrong !

86
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,200
And the thing is,
optimism is nice if you can swing it.

87
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,920
But you've got to be careful !

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,960
It can feed into
the normalization of Donald Trump.

89
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,880
And he is not normal.
He is abnormal.

90
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,680
He's a human
"what is wrong with this picture ?"

91
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,840
He sticks out like a sore thumb
and he even looks like a sore thumb.

92
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,520
So giving him a chance

93
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,480
in the sense of not speaking out
against policies that he's proposed

94
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,360
is dangerous,
because some of them are alarming.

95
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,720
Just some of Trump's promises:
repeal and replace Obamacare.

96
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,600
Build a wall along
the southern border with Mexico

97
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,960
and get Mexico to pay for said wall.

98
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,920
Deport all 11-12 million undocumented
immigrants in USA, including children,

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,960
appoint a prosecutor to investigate
and potentially jail Hillary Clinton,

100
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,800
temporarily ban Muslims and
immigrants from terror-prone nations

101
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,480
from coming into the US.

102
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,440
Stop ! It sounds like you're reading
the to-do list on Satan's refrigerator.

103
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,800
Which Satan no longer needs,
now that Hell has frozen over.

104
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,520
While some are arguing that Trump
might not have meant all those things,

105
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,160
that leaves us
with two devastating options:

106
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,520
we elected a president
who didn't mean a single word he said.

107
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,000
Or, we elected one who did.
And it's impossible to know which one.

108
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,360
He did his first
major post-election interview,

109
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,720
and he was asked about Obamacare,
which he had labeled a disaster.

110
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,240
When you replace it,
are you going to make sure

111
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,600
that people with pre-conditions
are still covered ?

112
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,440
Yes. It happens to be
one of the strongest assets.

113
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,840
Also, with the children living with
their parents for an extended period.

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,920
- You're going to keep that ?
- Yes.

115
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,520
Get ready for a barely changed version
of Obamacare called "Trumpcare",

116
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,360
which sounds like a health care plan
where doctors

117
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,840
feel your breasts for lumps
whether you asked them to or not.

118
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,480
Don't get complacent that he's going
to keep those aspects of Obamacare

119
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,840
he might change his mind
on that again.

120
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,560
Trump is like a magic 8 ball.

121
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,760
Every time you shake him
he gives you a different answer.

122
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,920
Sometimes the answer
is "big league"

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,560
or "that's some body
on my daughter, right ?"

124
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,880
So, we have to take
all of Trump's promises seriously.

125
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,600
And the truth is,
they were not all universally bad.

126
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,760
For instance: he ran on a promise
to "drain the swamp",

127
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,640
cracking down on corruption and ending
the reign of Washington insiders.

128
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,200
Let's try and be positive.
What are the early signs on that ?

129
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,120
Some of the potential cabinet members
that are being reported by CNN...

130
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,560
Rudy Giuliani, Newt Gingrich,
Chris Christie. Reince Priebus.

131
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,280
Right.
That's the long-time head of the RNC,

132
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,720
a former Speaker
who entered Congress in 1979,

133
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,760
a former mayor
turned professional asshole,

134
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,160
and a man whose name
is more synonymous with scandal

135
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,200
than Shonda fucking Rhimes.

136
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,200
That is so swampy, you're gonna
need to swap out Air Force One

137
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,840
for one of those shallow-bottom
boats with a big fan on the back.

138
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,760
And the thing is, it actually makes
sense for Trump to appoint people

139
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,400
with significant experience
in government.

140
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,480
Until a few days ago,
the highest office he'd ever held

141
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,840
was on the 26th floor of a shitty
building on Fifth Avenue.

142
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,360
But some of the people
he's bringing in are horrifying.

143
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,680
His transition team includes
people like Ken Blackwell,

144
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,360
who has argued
that homosexuality is a choice,

145
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,680
and he's named Myron Ebell
to lead his EPA transition team,

146
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,520
making him a frontrunner
for administrator, despite this.

147
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,640
The whole case for global warming,
I believe, is silly,

148
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,520
and I believe the vast majority
of scientists think it's silly,

149
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,360
and I'm a little embarrassed
that I waste my time on a silly issue.

150
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,640
First of all,
the vast majority of scientists

151
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,600
believe humans
are contributing to climate change.

152
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,880
And secondly, this man
does not have a science degree.

153
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,480
He wouldn't even be qualified to head
the Agency of Baking Soda Volcanoes.

154
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,840
So, how the fuck did we get here ?

155
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,240
There are many possible answers
to that question,

156
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,480
including misleading forecasts
that bred complacency,

157
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,000
a flawed candidate who failed to appeal
to white rural and workingclass voters,

158
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,600
and this is worth repeating
deep racism and/or indifference to it.

159
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,160
And for those, including us,
who were shocked by Tuesday,

160
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,880
we're going to be examining
all this for years.

161
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,360
But let's look at one narrow element
that may've helped bring us here,

162
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,080
because it will be important
going forward, and that is our media.

163
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,400
How a system that is supposed
to catch a serial liar, failed.

164
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,320
And I'm not just referring
to mainstream TV news,

165
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,760
although some did wait far too long
to take Trump seriously,

166
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,800
giving him billions
of dollars' worth of free media.

167
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,000
CNN, for instance, sometimes ran
his speeches almost in their entirety.

168
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,000
Their president, Jeff Zucker,

169
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,840
admits that might not have been
such a great idea.

170
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,240
I'd say that if we made
a mistake last year,

171
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,520
it's that we probably did put on
too many of his campaign rallies

172
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,480
in those early months,

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,920
unedited and just let them run.

174
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,960
And I think we probably
shouldn't have done that as much.

175
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,200
It turns out hindsight, much like
the year we're looking forward to,

176
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,800
is 20-20.

177
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,840
It's not to say that there wasn't
great coverage of Trump,

178
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,320
from outlets like the Washington Post
and the New York Times.

179
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,880
Even CNN began correcting Trump
in lower-third graphics, such as...

180
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,920
"Trump: 'I never said Japan should
have nukes,' parentheses, he did."

181
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,280
And that is good journalism.

182
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,240
If I gave a speech
saying I'm the sexiest man alive,

183
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,840
it would be fair to tag that
with "parentheses: 'Look at him'".

184
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,440
That's a mean joke to laugh at.

185
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,320
But the problem is...
The impact of corrections like that,

186
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,280
which may have sunk a candidate
in another era, was compromised.

187
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Because there is no longer
a consensus on what a fact is.

188
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,520
Trust in mainstream media outlets
has been falling.

189
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,600
People can get their news from echo
chambers that validate their views.

190
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,680
There is nothing wrong
with media that has a viewpoint.

191
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,000
We fact-check everything we say,
but I don't pretend to be neutral

192
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,160
on things like criminal justice reform,
I'm for it.

193
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,000
Coldplay. I'm against it.

194
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,640
Or DeWalt ladders. They're a seamless
blend of style and performance.

195
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,000
Walking up one is like ascending
to heaven on a golden cloud.

196
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,680
I'm not being paid to say that,
I'm just a fan.

197
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,680
But, a healthy media diet
has to be broader than that.

198
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,040
Unfortunately, the way that many of us
consume news now is micro-targeted.

199
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,160
62 percent of Americans say
they get their news from social media.

200
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,960
According to Pew Research,
44% of all adults

201
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,880
say they get news from Facebook.

202
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,400
That's true, news is now one of the 3
things that we get from social media,

203
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,480
the other two being
"our entire sense of self-worth"

204
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,520
and pictures of shaved alpacas.

205
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,880
And, fake facts circulate
on social media to a frightening extent.

206
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,360
You may have seen this quote from
Trump about Republicans being dumb.

207
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,880
He never said that, it's not true.

208
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,200
Just as it's not true
that the pope endorsed Trump.

209
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,200
Because of course he didn't.

210
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,920
But that story was shared almost
a million times. Which is absurd.

211
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,920
Everybody knows the candidate
the pope endorsed was Joe Exotic.

212
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,920
They have very similar views
on deregulating tiger preserves.

213
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,600
Please share this news
a million times.

214
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,120
There is a whole cottage industry
specializing in hyperpartisan,

215
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,640
sometimes wildly-distorted clickbait.

216
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,640
Buzzfeed News researched sites
like "Addicting Info" on the left

217
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,640
and "Freedom Daily" on the right,

218
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,840
both of which have over a million
followers on Facebook,

219
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,120
putting them in the same range
as Anderson Cooper 360.

220
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,160
Some were publishing many viral
articles containing flat-out falsehoods.

221
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,480
Over two weeks, 38% of news on some
Republican-leaning Facebook pages

222
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,880
was partly or completely false,
compared to 19% of news

223
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,240
shared on some Democrat-leaning
pages.

224
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,480
Before you say:
"Republicans are twice as bad",

225
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,080
19 percent is still terrible.

226
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,920
And it is not news that there is
misinformation on Facebook.

227
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,360
Just look at the relationship status
"it's complicated",

228
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,680
the accurate version would be:

229
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,960
"in three weeks I'll be single,
but I can't admit it yet."

230
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,760
These sites can warp
your views pretty fast.

231
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,560
Your news feed may've been full
of The Times and The Post's stories

232
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,560
about Trump's actual scandals,
but many Americans

233
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,760
logged onto Facebook every day
and saw shit like this.

234
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,520
This cesspool of nonsense
would be a problem anyway,

235
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,000
were it not for the fact that one
of the people enthralled to it

236
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,560
is our future president.

237
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,760
In March, he claimed that a man
who'd rushed the stage at his rallies

238
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,880
had ties to ISIS, something
that had circulated online

239
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,760
and had been found to be untrue.

240
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,120
And when that was pointed out
to him, this was his response.

241
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,040
There's no ties to ISIS for this man,
no law enforcement official,

242
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,200
and this video
appears to be a hoax.

243
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,080
All I know
is what's on the Internet.

244
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,720
Okay, here's the thing,

245
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,800
"being on the internet"
is not a high bar for accuracy.

246
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,680
If I edited Wikipedia to say
that Dianne Wiest's real name

247
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,680
is "Dianne Frosted Mini-Wiest",

248
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,360
our next president would
believe that to be true.

249
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,080
During the campaign, Trump
routinely used his platform

250
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,480
to share incorrect information.

251
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,320
Fellow conservatives tried to point
out how irresponsible this was.

252
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,760
You tweeted out
that whites killed by blacks,

253
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,720
these are statistics you picked up
from somewhere,

254
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,120
at a rate of 81%.

255
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,680
And that's totally wrong.
Whites killed by blacks is 15%.

256
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,280
Bill, am I gonna check
every statistic ?

257
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,000
I get millions of people
@realdonaldtrump.

258
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,160
You're a presidential contender,
you gotta check it.

259
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,480
Fine, but this came out of radio
shows and everything else.

260
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,120
Okay.
"I got it from radio"

261
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,240
is maybe the weirdest nonsense
explanation I've ever heard,

262
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,520
like if someone said:
"this sandwich tastes weird"

263
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,120
and you said:
"but I found it in a hole !"

264
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,040
"If there's something wrong with it,
what was it doing sitting in a hole ?"

265
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,800
And that is the evil genius
at work here.

266
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,880
Weird conspiracy bullshit has always
been bubbling under the surface,

267
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,000
but Trump was the first major
candidate to harness and legitimize it.

268
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,920
And it's in hindsight. He came along
and told millions of people:

269
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,920
"every crazy email you've ever
forwarded was true".

270
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,120
And that, at least in part, is why
he will be our next president.

271
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,080
And to their credit, some
Republican lawmakers

272
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,880
were calling him out on this
during the campaign.

273
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,800
I'm going to tell you what
I think of Donald Trump:

274
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,480
this man
is a pathological liar.

275
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,320
Doesn't know the difference
between truth and lies.

276
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,560
He was just right.

277
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,000
Before you think Republicans
might now stand up to Trump,

278
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,160
I will remind you that
Ted Cruz, like many others,

279
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,160
not only said he'd vote
for Trump, but was doing this.

280
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,040
Hi, this is Ted Cruz.

281
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,360
I was calling to encourage you
to vote on Election Day.

282
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,560
That is hard to watch !

283
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,800
Hi, this is Ted Cruz, calling to
remind you to vote for a man

284
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,800
who insulted my wife and said
my dad helped kill JFK.

285
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,480
Life has no meaning,
thank you, I want to die.

286
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,000
Take care now ! God is dead !
Buh-bye !

287
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,840
Buh-bye now, buh-bye.

288
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,400
There is very little holding
Trump back.

289
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,760
Remember: in January,
he will be sworn into office.

290
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,520
And there is another wave
of nausea for you.

291
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,320
It hits you in small
ways and large doesn't it ?

292
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,360
Had you considered
that portraits of Trump

293
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,720
are going to be hanging
in our airports ?

294
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,520
Or that the man who disparaged
a Gold Star family

295
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,240
will now be expected to comfort
the families of fallen soldiers ?

296
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,280
Maybe you've tried
to feel better,

297
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,160
fantasizing he might Google "how
much does the president get paid,"

298
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,960
get depressed and resign.

299
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,960
But that is when you remember
Mike fucking Pence.

300
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,360
Who might be even worse.
He looks like he's from the 1950's,

301
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,240
but he thinks
like he's from the 1650's.

302
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,680
What's that ? Her pregnancy
was terminated before birth ?

303
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,640
Clearly she's a witch.
Hold a funeral for the fetus

304
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,440
and throw the mother in a lake.

305
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,880
I know this is all depressing,
but it does bring us back

306
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,120
to the question:
"what the fuck do we do now ?"

307
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,800
And for the record, the answer
is not "move to Canada".

308
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,480
The only excuse
to ever migrate to Canada

309
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,720
is if you were born there originally,
it's springtime and you are a goose.

310
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,400
That's it. That is it.

311
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,200
We're gonna need
to stay here and fight.

312
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,160
And not just politically in four
years, when he's up for re-election,

313
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,120
but constantly, monitoring legislation
as it moves through congress

314
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,160
and voting when your legislators
come up for re-election in two years.

315
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,600
That is still below the minimum
of what is going to be needed.

316
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,320
For the last eight years,
we've had a president

317
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,280
we could assume would generally
stand up for the rights of Americans.

318
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,320
But that is going to change now.

319
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,840
We're going to have to actively
stand up for one another.

320
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,600
And it can't be just sounding off
on the Internet

321
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,720
or sharing think pieces or videos like
this that echo around your bubble.

322
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,720
I'm talking about sacrifice to support
people who are now under threat.

323
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,200
If you can afford
the time or money,

324
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,000
support organizations
that are going to need help

325
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,040
under a Trump administration.

326
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,480
If you're concerned about women's
health, donate to Planned Parenthood

327
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,760
or the Center
for Reproductive Rights.

328
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,200
If you don't believe manmade
global warming is a silly issue,

329
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,200
donate to the National Resources
Defense Council.

330
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,680
If you don't think refugees
are a terrorist army in disguise,

331
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,000
donate to The International
Refugee Assistance Project.

332
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,440
Also given
these guys' track record,

333
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,120
I would recommend donations
to The NAACP legal defense fund,

334
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,600
the Trevor Project for LGBTQ youth

335
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,200
and the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund.

336
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,400
That last one would be perfect
if your compassion for Latinos

337
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,760
goes beyond occasionally
eating a fucking taco bowl.

338
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,240
Do check the box for recurring
donations if you can,

339
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,760
this is not a short-term problem.

340
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,600
I'll give you just a dash
of fun here, I will point out:

341
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,280
if you have relatives
who supported Trump,

342
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,240
you can give money in their name.

343
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,680
So, consider your holiday
shopping this year done.

344
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,440
Happy holidays, Nana.
The Trevor Project thanks you.

345
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,040
There's one more group that
I would single out for help here

346
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,480
and that is the press.

347
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,840
Trump is a masterful denier of
both reality and responsibility.

348
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,960
He would kick you in the nuts and
tell you that your penis did it.

349
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,120
So the press
is going to face challenges,

350
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,360
not because Trump's chief strategist
is Steve Bannon of Breitbart news,

351
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,600
but also because of yet another
promise that Trump made.

352
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,240
If I become president,
do they have problems !

353
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,680
I'm going to open up
our libel laws

354
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,080
so when they write purposely negative
and horrible and false articles,

355
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,200
we can sue them
and win lots of money.

356
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,280
We're going to open up
those libel laws.

357
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,200
First, there is no federal
libel law for Trump to open up.

358
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,040
As many supposed recipients
of Trump's gifts might tell you,

359
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,120
you can't open something up
if it doesn't exist.

360
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,440
But that attitude of punishing
the press is worrisome

361
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,840
now that he is going
to be president.

362
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,320
Instead of sharing partisan memes
found on "republigoofs dot redneck"

363
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,840
and "democrappy dot cuck",
you need to support actual journalism

364
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,320
by buying a subscription to outlets
like the Times, or the Post.

365
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,920
Or donating to Propublica, a nonprofit
with great investigative journalism.

366
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,240
If we don't get involved to at least
mitigate Trump's damage,

367
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,920
things will not be okay.

368
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,480
Yes, the sun will rise each day, but
the continuing rotation of the earth

369
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,320
should not be your baseline
expectation of American society.

370
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,080
I need to ask you
one more thing:

371
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,160
it'll be too easy
for things to start feeling normal,

372
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,000
especially if you are not
directly impacted by his actions.

373
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,960
Keep reminding yourself,
this is not normal.

374
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,480
Write it on a post-it note and
stick it on your refrigerator.

375
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,800
Hire a sky writer once a month.
Tattoo it on your ass.

376
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,440
A Klan-backed, misogynist,
Internet-troll

377
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,960
is going to be delivering
the next state of the union address.

378
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,240
And that is not normal,
it is fucked up.

379
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,040
And the only thing that gives me
one degree of comfort

380
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,120
is that I think part of Trump
might be realizing that now, too.

381
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,400
Look at his face after
meeting with Paul Ryan

382
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,960
and getting a glimpse of what
this job actually entails.

383
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,600
Here is the genuine audio
from that moment.

384
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,320
I feel the same. I don't know
what happens from here.

385
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,440
This is our final show of the year.
And normally, on our last show,

386
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,280
we mash up elements from the season
and dance around in the studio.

387
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,240
But that doesn't seem
appropriate tonight.

388
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,520
Not just because of the election,

389
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,160
but because 2016 has been
an uncommonly shitty year.

390
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:43,720
From the ongoing crisis in Syria,
to Zika, to Ryan Lochte being a douche,

391
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,800
to a seemingly
endless string of celebrity deaths

392
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,280
including, just this week,
Leonard Cohen.

393
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,080
We've put something together about
how awful this year has been,

394
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,920
we started it a while ago, but it now
feels more prescient than ever.

395
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,560
Because even though this year
still has seven weeks left,

396
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm calling it early: 2016
has been the fucking worst.

397
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,240
Thank you for watching, enjoy
this tribute to a truly terrible year.

398
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,680
Let's face it. 2016 has been
one calamity after another

399
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,840
and while it will be remembered
for the giant calamity we witnessed,

400
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,600
we shouldn't lose sight of the other
ways this has been a shitty year.

401
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,120
If we could erase 2016 off
the calendar, it'd be perfect.

402
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,560
Pretty rotten year.
Most people would admit that.

403
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,840
It totally blew. It was awful.

404
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,360
This world is feeling scarier,
it's feeling colder.

405
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,320
For EU,
it was a really crap year.

406
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,840
The Brexit was kind of a mess.

407
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,600
Hatred to a lot of groups,
that's been the staple of this year.

408
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,120
Syrian refugee crisis.
Pretty terrible.

409
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,240
Lots of sexism being blatant.

410
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,160
It's disgusting what the city
of Flint did to its residents.

411
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,680
The New York Jets suck.
Yankees missed the playoffs.

412
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,800
I didn't like Kevin Durant
going to Golden State.

413
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,640
A chicken-shit move.

414
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,800
Some asshole
stole my watch in Miami.

415
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,040
I got broken up with.
Pretty shitty.

416
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,840
Had a girlfriend for three years,
broke up with me.

417
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,240
My landlord is shit.

418
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,480
Met Bruce Willis a week ago, ask him
for picture and he said no.

419
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,280
My son is at puberty
and being a pain in the ass.

420
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,760
I got all mauled up by a dog,
the cherry on top of a shitty year.

421
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,160
Menopause.

422
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,800
Never forget Harambe.

423
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,280
Harambe's listening. Took shots,
we should take shots for him.

424
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,600
Too many deaths.

425
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,400
Prince is my man. I miss Prince.

426
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,400
Prince,
I mean, that was just...

427
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,560
The worst is
the David Bowie's death.

428
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,920
David Bowie.
What the fuck ?

429
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,400
Bowie.
That was my big one.

430
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,240
Phife Dawg, man.
Shout out to Q-Tip, man.

431
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,880
Tribe Called Quest.
I grew up on that.

432
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,480
Muhammad Ali
was one of the biggest.

433
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,320
What he represents for blacks,
that's a huge deal.

434
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,680
Move like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

435
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,160
Gene Wilder.

436
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,880
Alan Rickman.
Fucking Snape dude.

437
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,560
Man, this year did suck.

438
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,200
Fuck 2016.

439
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,560
Fuck you, 2016.

440
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,960
Fuck 2016.

441
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,400
Fuck you, 2016.
Bad year. Shit year.

442
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,560
2016, this is for you.

443
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,760
Fuck 2016.
Fuck it a lot.

444
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,440
Fuck 2016.
And fuck Donald Trump.

445
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,680
Fuck 2016.

446
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,880
CNN won't let me say this on New
Year's Eve, but get fucked, 2016.

447
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,440
Fuck 2016.

448
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,240
Fuck 2016.

449
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,280
What is this, mayonnaise ?
Fuck 2016.

450
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,080
Fuck you, 2016.

451
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,120
Fuck you, 2016.

452
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,520
2016, fuck off.

453
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,720
2016 falls well below
my standards of quality.

454
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,800
Fuck 2016.

455
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,600
Fuck you, 2016.

456
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,680
2016, go punch yourself
in the dick.

457
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,720
Fuck this year.

458
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,920
Fuck you, 2016.

459
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,240
Fuck John Oliver.

460
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:22,200
2016, fuck you. And hey, 2017,
fuck you, too. I hate you already.

461
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,360
Fuck you, 2016.

462
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,920
You're asking me ?
Fuck 2016.

463
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,440
Fuck 2016.

464
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,760
2016, from the bottom
of my heart, go fuck yourself.

465
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,920
Fuck you, 2016. Fuck. You.

466
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,600
That's our show.
Thanks so much for watching.

467
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,560
Let's all try harder next year.
Good night.

468
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,480
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

469
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,000
END OF EPISODE 30,
SEASON III
