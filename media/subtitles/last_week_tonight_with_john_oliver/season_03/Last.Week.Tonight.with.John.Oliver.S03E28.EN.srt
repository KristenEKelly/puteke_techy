LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,880
SEASON III
EPISODE 28

3
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,600
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,160
Thank you for joining us !
Before we start,

5
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,880
look, we did not want to talk
about the election at all this week.

6
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,000
We so badly
wanted to give everyone a break.

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,520
We even prepped
a fun story about Iceland,

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,480
which had a fascinating election.

9
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,840
If you think things
are turbulent this election,

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,800
be glad you don't live in Iceland.

11
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,320
Pirates could soon
be running that country.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,160
It's true ! Pirates were running
for election in Iceland !

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,280
It was something called
"the Pirate Party",

14
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,440
but it was still very interesting,
we had some solid eye-patch jokes.

15
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,280
And it was going to be fun.
But we can't talk about it.

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,760
I can't talk about
Spain's new government,

17
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,760
or that Austria is awaiting its 3rd
attempt at a presidential election,

18
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,040
after the last one was postponed

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,360
due to defective glue
on the absentee ballot envelopes.

20
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,080
I don't even have time to show
you all of this YouTube video

21
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,600
of a man who surprised a dog
by dressing up as its favorite toy.

22
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,640
Don't you want to see how that ends ?
That dog's expression is clearly:

23
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,640
"I'm going to hump
the shit out of that."

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,440
But there is no time,
because with a heavy heart,

25
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,800
we must begin
with the 2016 election:

26
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,960
"The shit-filled cornucopia
that just keeps on giving, 2016".

27
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,640
And it's all because
of what happened on Friday.

28
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,920
A dramatic new twist
in the presidential campaign.

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,000
The FBI is reviewing its investigation
into Hillary Clinton's use

30
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,240
of a private email server
while she was secretary of state

31
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,400
after the discovery of new emails that
appear to be pertinent to the case.

32
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,360
Perfect ! That's what this election,
everyone's state of mind, needed.

33
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,480
Bacardi should consider
switching their slogan...

34
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,120
"Bacardi: because there might be
more fucking Clinton emails."

35
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,040
If this shitty development
were not grim enough,

36
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,680
there is also the matter of where
this latest problem came from.

37
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,600
The unearthed emails
are from the FBI's investigation

38
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,360
into disgraced congressman
Anthony Weiner.

39
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,240
It's true. It seems Anthony Weiner
is forcing the nation

40
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,920
to relitigate
the entire email controversy,

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and putting Hillary Clinton's chances
of winning in serious danger...

42
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,720
Carlos Danger.

43
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,760
Damn it, Weiner !
For the record: this is a reflex.

44
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,680
I'm not having fun,
you are ruining my dance !

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,600
This is a disgusting way
for the email case to come to life.

46
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,640
Just watch Vice President Biden

47
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,920
learn about Weiner's involvement
for the very first time.

48
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,600
I don't know
where these emails came from.

49
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,160
- Apparently Anthony Weiner.
- God ! Anthony Weiner.

50
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,920
I should not comment
on Anthony Weiner.

51
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,440
You can picture Biden repressing
that news and going to his happy place,

52
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,680
which I assume is this actual picture
of him eating an ice cream,

53
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,680
wearing sunglasses,
and holding a fistful of money.

54
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,240
Perhaps the most frustrating thing

55
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,600
is we don't know yet
whether this is a huge problem,

56
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,920
or whether
it's barely a problem at all.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
FBI director James Comey
pointed out to Congress

58
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,520
that "FBI cannot assess whether or not
this material may be significant."

59
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,360
Sources have since dampened
expectations of what might emerge.

60
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,840
Sources tell us that Hillary Clinton is
not implicated in any of these emails,

61
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,640
so there is no, right now,
direct connection to Hillary Clinton,

62
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,920
but we don't know specifically
what is in these emails.

63
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,520
So nine days out from the election,

64
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,560
the FBI has basically delivered us
the equivalent of a mystery box.

65
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,400
And like the box from the end
of "Seven", it could contain anything,

66
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,840
from nothing
to Gwyneth Paltrow's head,

67
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,840
although it almost definitely contains
Anthony Weiner's penis.

68
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,000
And chances of getting this resolved
before the election seem slim.

69
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,600
So, thousands of emails
on the computer to examine.

70
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,680
They've got to get court process to
get the right to look at those emails.

71
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,480
Because remember this investigation
of Weiner was focused solely

72
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,080
on the texts that he sent
to an underage girl,

73
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,120
so they've got to get legal process
to take a wider look at these emails.

74
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,840
You said this won't be wrapped up
before Election Day. Scratch probably.

75
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,040
The grinding hell of this election
has thrown in yet another twist,

76
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,120
with the election potentially
hanging in the balance,

77
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,440
thanks to the fact Weiner allegedly
sexted with a 15-year-old girl.

78
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,200
Now, a month ago,
when Donald Trump tweeted

79
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,000
we should "check out a sex tape"
of a former Miss Universe contestant,

80
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,880
I said if you looked up,
you would see rock bottom.

81
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,680
If you look up now, you will see
absolutely nothing. I'll tell you why.

82
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,120
We have burrowed
through the core of the earth,

83
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,360
and we've come bursting out
the other side, startling kangaroos,

84
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,720
and we're hurtling
toward outer space,

85
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,400
where there is no up,
down, light, or darkness,

86
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,080
just an endless void in which death
comes as sweet, sweet relief.

87
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,360
Please let this thing be over soon.

88
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,120
And now, this !

89
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,080
The stream-of-consciousness musings
of WCBS-2 meteorologist, John Elliott.

90
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,240
It is 7:19,
time to check your local weather.

91
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,000
Thank you, Norah.

92
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,400
If I was to scale, my head
would be worth about $400 million.

93
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,600
Time to check your local weather.

94
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,160
Thank you Kristine. I know her.
I know Kristine Johnson.

95
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,880
You know what this guy
said to that guy ?

96
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,520
I'm next door. Here I am,
they were, I was waiting here.

97
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,160
I was just doing
a little batting practice.

98
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,080
Rob Lowe and his hair
are downstairs right now.

99
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,320
That's-this guy does not age.

100
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,160
A little gift. Like a little pearl,
I have the morning sun.

101
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,600
Mom is turning 90 this summer,
a few months behind the Queen.

102
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,480
So, yes, cheerio.

103
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,600
Frank Sinatra Jr.
was an excellent singer.

104
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,320
President's legs are thin.

105
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,840
Every gym I've ever been
to says no cell phone use.

106
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,760
So much of the country bacon...
I want bacon !

107
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,960
Time to check your local weather.

108
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,680
I've just gotta say it.
I think Gayle's hair looks great.

109
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,400
Moving on... Our main story tonight
concerns racism.

110
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,920
The problem that "Crash"
failed to solve.

111
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,040
And, specifically, we're going
to discuss school segregation

112
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,800
which, it turns out,
is still a big problem.

113
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,160
Racial segregation is on the rise.
The number of schools

114
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,880
where 1 percent or less
of the student population is white

115
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,560
has more than doubled
in the last twenty years.

116
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,880
That's true. Even as our society
has grown more diverse,

117
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,880
nearly 7 000 schools
have the same racial makeup

118
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,760
as the audience of your average
Tyler Perry movie.

119
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,200
That one white guy is Leonard Maltin !
And he has to be there, it's his job !

120
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,640
"A Madea Halloween... three stars !"

121
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,320
If you are in a city like New York,
you're probably thinking,

122
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,720
"Splendid !
I know where this is going:"

123
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,200
"a story vilifying the backwards
and racist American South !"

124
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,120
"Let me grab kale chips that I can
munch on while feeling superior."

125
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,160
There is something
you should probably know.

126
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,720
According to the
UCLA Civil Rights Project,

127
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,240
the south is the least segregated
region for black students.

128
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,760
New York State is now the most
segregated system in America,

129
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,240
in large part due to New York City.

130
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,560
Shit, liberal white New Yorkers:
twist ending !

131
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,600
You were racist the whole time !

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,040
Put back those persimmons you bought
yourselves as a treat from Fairway.

133
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,960
You don't deserve them anymore !

134
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,160
It would still be problematic,
even if these schools

135
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,360
were roughly equivalent academically
as that would still be a violation

136
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,000
of the principle of Brown
versus Board Of Education

137
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,800
that "separate educational facilities
are inherently unequal".

138
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,400
But in practice,
they are very rarely equal in any way.

139
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,840
Blacks and Latinos

140
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,960
are more likely to attend schools
with inexperienced teachers,

141
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,560
which are then less likely to offer
a college-prep curriculum.

142
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,440
Because race and class
are inextricably linked,

143
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,600
those students are six times as likely
to be in high poverty schools.

144
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,840
While there are teachers and students
working very hard in those places,

145
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,400
they are often doing so
with fewer resources.

146
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,000
As one student learned,
during a school exchange program.

147
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,680
We do what's called a "school swap".

148
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,440
Students that go to county high schools
attend a school in the city for one day

149
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,160
then students in the city attend
a school in the county for one day.

150
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,560
The first thing that I noticed
was all this stuff around here,

151
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,560
stuff that looked like
it cost lots of money.

152
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,720
When teachers come in,
they can get right on topic,

153
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,920
they have multiple computers...

154
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,120
I relate it back to my school.
We don't have all that.

155
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,360
I get what that program was trying
to do, but it still seems cruel,

156
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,920
giving students a glimpse
of what other kids are getting.

157
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,240
At least on a plane,
they cover first class with a curtain.

158
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,240
Sure, they might still bake cookies
and waft the smell down the aisle,

159
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,200
but that's just to fuck with you.

160
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,320
So how is it possible
that our nation's schools

161
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,560
are more segregated now than they
have been in over four decades ?

162
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,480
Places like New York
haven't so much "re-segregated"

163
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,000
as "never really bothered
integrating in the first place."

164
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,080
Because the 1964 Civil Rights Act

165
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,080
was very carefully crafted
by northern lawmakers.

166
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,280
It targeted the kind of segregation
"by law" which existed in the South.

167
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,440
You couldn't have a school that was
officially designated "whites only".

168
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,800
But it exempted the so-called
"racial imbalance" of northern schools.

169
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,120
If a New York school was white because
it was drawing from an all-white area

170
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,600
even if that area had been kept
that way

171
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,320
due to a host of racist housing
policies that was somehow fine.

172
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,760
If you're thinking it is hypocritical
bullshit, you are not alone.

173
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,560
Malcolm X was pointing this out,
in New York, at the time.

174
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,480
You don't have to go to Mississippi
to find a segregated school system.

175
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,160
It shows that the problems
that the white liberals

176
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,960
have been pointing the finger
at the southern segregationists

177
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,760
and condemning them for,
exist right here in New York City.

178
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,160
Of course racism exists in New York.

179
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,440
Have you never seen
"West Side Story" ?

180
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,080
It is a musical about
love transcending the obstacle

181
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,240
of "one person being Puerto Rican."

182
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,080
It'll never work !

183
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,880
And for what it's worth:
when, on rare occasions,

184
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,560
northern cities were forced
to desegregate,

185
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,960
things got as ugly
as they did down South.

186
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,120
One Boston man
describes his memories

187
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,920
of being sent to a school
in a white neighborhood.

188
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,760
So, my first day of school
was when we got off the school bus

189
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,080
was right on the steps.

190
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,280
In white paint,
niggers go back home to Africa.

191
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,800
You got all these whites out there,
with signs calling us niggers,

192
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,320
you know, go back home.

193
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,560
And then some of these same kids
you would see in class.

194
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,680
"What's up with that ?

195
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,480
Yeah. He's got a point there.

196
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,040
They shout "go home to Africa"
and then sit beside you in class ?

197
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,320
I hope the kids who heard
that had the opportunity to go:

198
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,080
"You want to borrow a pencil ?"

199
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,280
"I'm sorry, I must've left mine
in Kenya this morning."

200
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,360
For a taste of the general paranoia
surrounding this issue back then,

201
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,800
watch this trailer for a movie
called "Halls of Anger".

202
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,160
A handful of white students
are transferred to an all-black school.

203
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,200
You know there's gonna be trouble.

204
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,560
Vanilla ice cream !

205
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,200
And I'm gonna take me a big lick !

206
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:58,560
That is clearly horrible. But using
the terms "chocolate" and "vanilla"

207
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,560
is the best possible argument
for bringing races closer together.

208
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,280
What happens when you combine
chocolate and vanilla ?

209
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,560
Fucking "fudgie the whale" happens !

210
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,120
And it is superb !

211
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,000
And even though the path
to integration was rough

212
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,600
and the burden fell disproportionately
on African-American communities,

213
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,560
there were still clear benefits.

214
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,680
Bringing in white children
also brought in resources,

215
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,640
to an almost comical extent.

216
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,800
Immediately, when the decision
was made that white kids

217
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,640
would be bused into West Charlotte,
it was like a community joke.

218
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,800
Overnight,
the gravel parking lot was paved.

219
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,920
The athletic facilities,
in terms of the football stadium,

220
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,680
basketball and gymnasium stuff
was upgraded.

221
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,480
It was like overnight someone had
written a check for a million dollars.

222
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,320
Exactly. Funding tends to follow
white people around

223
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,280
the way white people follow
the band Phish around.

224
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,480
"It's a different show every time.
Last time I was rolling"

225
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,560
"'cause I snorted molly
off a communal didgeridoo."

226
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,240
"Different show every time man !"

227
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,960
That man's school was in Charlotte,
North Carolina,

228
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,160
a city which became a model for
how desegregation could be effective.

229
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,640
By the end of the 1980s,

230
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,680
just 1 percent of Latino children,
and 3 percent of Black children,

231
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,040
were attending schools
considered "racially isolated",

232
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,480
that is,
90 percent or more minority.

233
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,280
This was such a point of pride
that when President Reagan visited,

234
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,000
and tried to talk shit
about Charlotte's system,

235
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,640
it didn't go down too well.

236
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,960
They favor busing that takes innocent
children out of the neighborhood school

237
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,440
and makes them pawns in a social
experiment that nobody wants.

238
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,960
We've found out it failed.
I don't call that compassion.

239
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,480
Reagan got no reaction
from the crowd on that line.

240
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,880
I took great offense to it
and I stomped across the floor

241
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:58,320
and said a few choice expletives
about the president and cut off the TV.

242
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,040
That is some
courtly southern aggression.

243
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,520
I'm guessing his choice expletives
were "heavens to Betsy",

244
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,600
"that really fried my grits"

245
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,720
and "you are a scoundrel without
valor ! Without valor I say !"

246
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:23,240
What happened in Charlotte is the story
of desegregation in a nutshell.

247
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,720
In 1997, a white parent
got upset when his daughter

248
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,200
lost out in an lottery
for a magnet school,

249
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,800
which had reserved
seats for black children.

250
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,920
Even though
she was still assigned

251
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,080
to one of the top 10 elementary schools
in the state, he filed a lawsuit.

252
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,440
I believe that my daughter's
constitutional rights were violated

253
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,920
and as a concerned parent,
a responsible parent I hope,

254
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,120
it was my job
to look after her well-being.

255
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,760
Okay, sure. But she was
already in a top 10 school.

256
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,440
Making sure your kid
has a good education

257
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,160
is one of the most important
jobs a parent can do.

258
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,480
It's up there with lying about
not having a favorite child.

259
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,440
Because every parent has a favorite
child and it's Dylan.

260
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,440
It's not you, it's not any
of your siblings. It's Dylan.

261
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,720
Just ask your parents.
They like Dylan.

262
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,760
He does his own laundry.

263
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,240
That man's selfishness
had a huge impact.

264
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,240
A federal judge
ruled in his favor,

265
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,440
vacating the district's desegregation
plan, blowing up the whole thing.

266
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,040
Charlotte then experienced
swift resegregation.

267
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,880
As by 2010, those one and three
percent figures for Latinos and Blacks

268
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,080
had grown to 44
and 47 percent.

269
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,040
It is tempting to be angry at that
one parent because,

270
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,360
before the verdict came down,
he moved his family to California.

271
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,120
The constitutional
challenge equivalent

272
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,200
of farting in a crowded elevator
as you're stepping off of it.

273
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,120
This wasn't an isolated incident,

274
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,680
all over the country desegregation
plans were struck down.

275
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,520
Thanks to Supreme Court rulings
making it easier to challenge them.

276
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,040
And the prevailing narrative,
became that desegregation imposed

277
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,320
too high a cost on students for
a benefit that was no longer necessary.

278
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,000
An attitude best summed up
by this Louisiana state senator.

279
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,200
Do you think that you have
to bus children long distance,

280
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,080
so you can say you sit in a seat next
to someone different from yourself ?

281
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,920
Justice department achieved their goal.
Who can say we're not desegregated ?

282
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,640
We have
an African-American president,

283
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,960
we have an African-American
mayor here in Baton Rouge

284
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,080
with a majority white
in the parish.

285
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,480
We've been through all that.

286
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,760
There it is: the idea that,
because President Obama was elected,

287
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,120
systemic racism
was pretty much solved.

288
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,040
Which is absolutely absurd,

289
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,360
because racism is not one of those
things that disappears on its own.

290
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,120
It's not like chicken pox
or Chewbacca mom.

291
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,520
I know I have just restarted
the clock on that one

292
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,280
and I am genuinely sorry.

293
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,640
So the only solution here
is to be proactive.

294
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,160
If you just assign kids to their
neighborhood schools

295
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,600
and their neighborhoods
are segregated,

296
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,680
you will have a segregated school.

297
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,280
There are some parents
who would resist

298
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,400
just about anything
that might result in integration.

299
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,720
Listen to how these parents in
St. Louis reacted to the idea

300
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,040
of students from a black
community added to their schools.

301
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,160
So will this district,
send my son to a better school

302
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,880
when this one goes down.

303
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,440
We don't want this
here in Francis Howell.

304
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,840
I deserve to not have to worry
about my children getting stabbed

305
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,640
or taking a drug or getting
robbed because that's the issue.

306
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,240
That is not subtle. She is just
a "homies" and a "baggy pants" away

307
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,080
from full dog-whistle bingo.

308
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,760
Those parents
are all extreme examples.

309
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,880
But even if you give
everyone the benefit of the doubt

310
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,440
and you assume all complaints
about bus schedules or class sizes

311
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,600
are actually just about buses
or class sizes,

312
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:20,720
you don't have to be intentionally
racist to do things with racist effect.

313
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,520
In the '60s, if you had insisted
on separate lunch counters,

314
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,440
not because you hated black people,
but you loved your son so much,

315
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,720
you wanted him
to get his lunch quicker,

316
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,120
the end result
would have been the same.

317
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,480
I get the impulse to seize every
tiny advantage you can for your kid.

318
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,600
Segregated schools cause devastating
harm to actual children

319
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,640
and not just to their education,
but to their very sense of self-worth.

320
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,400
We don't have support at all.
We have lack of books, resources,

321
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
anything you can think of, but when
in contact with these white children,

322
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,000
they don't know how to act because
they believe they're better than us.

323
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,600
We neither,
we believe they're better than us.

324
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,160
That is heartbreaking.
Classrooms should teach children

325
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,560
about the importance of
self-esteem, not rip it from them.

326
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,760
Because that's what
prom is for.

327
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,960
And there can be lasting
positive impacts to integration.

328
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,240
Not because the mere act of having
a white classmate is somehow magic,

329
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,360
unless of course that kid has
round glasses, a scar on his forehead

330
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,720
and sits alone
on parents' visiting day.

331
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,520
Getting to attend a good, middle-class
school can be transformative.

332
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,600
Professor Rucker Johnson
studied Black siblings

333
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,920
where one went to a desegregated
school, the other didn't.

334
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,880
Not only did those exposed to more
years of desegregation fare better,

335
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,560
but their kids did, too
and that is not all.

336
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,080
Blacks who attended
desegregated elementary schools

337
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,000
were more likely to graduate

338
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,160
and 22% less likely
to be incarcerated as adults.

339
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,000
Johnson found that the narrowing
of the achievement gap

340
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,600
and the increased
success of black Americans

341
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,840
did not have any negative effect
on whites on any metric.

342
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,680
It was good for black people
and had no effect on white people.

343
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,160
It's like this canister of
"black n' sassy cream shine."

344
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,800
I am pretty sure
I can make that joke.

345
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,200
I am pretty sure that's okay.
Hold on.

346
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,040
Which writer pitched it ? Shit !
That doesn't help.

347
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,280
The point is, for white children,

348
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,440
a lack of experience with people of
other races can have downsides.

349
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,280
Just watch one young girl
take a racial bias test.

350
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,240
Show me the good child.

351
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,440
- Why is she the good child ?
- I think she looks like me.

352
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,920
Okay. Show me the bad child.

353
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,120
- Why is she the bad child ?
- Because she's a lot darker.

354
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,280
What do you think ?
Shocking to you ?

355
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,240
I just think
it's 'cause she's not exposed.

356
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,280
Exactly. And that is why
it is important to expose kids

357
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,960
to other races at a young age.

358
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,320
You don't want your child playing
"Guess Who?" at a party

359
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,640
and asking "is this person bad ?"
to rule out anyone who isn't white.

360
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,840
While you can absolutely teach kids
about racism in the abstract,

361
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,160
if your school is overwhelmingly white,
important nuances can get lost,

362
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,280
as this second-grader found after
a bold choice for a school project.

363
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,120
I have a dream today.

364
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,360
I have a dream that my four children
will one day live in a nationý

365
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:42,160
Sean is portraying a historical figure
assigned by his teacher.

366
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,840
Martin Luther King junior.

367
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,000
He said mom I want to wear a suit
and a black tie.

368
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,760
I have to wear a white shirt and
I want to do my face in black.

369
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,080
They thought it was inappropriate
and disrespectful to black people.

370
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,280
But I say that it's not.
I like black people.

371
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,080
Okay, first...

372
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,760
Second: it is not that kid's fault
he didn't know any better.

373
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,160
Finally: if Martin Luther King Jr.
could see that clip,

374
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,400
I don't know whether
he'd be thrilled or horrified.

375
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:23,560
He might be both ! He'd be like:
"I made a difference... To a point."

376
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,520
So the benefits of truly diverse
schools are obvious.

377
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,320
The problem is, often just
our willingness to do it at all.

378
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Some school districts are now
looking for ways to fix things.

379
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,320
And there are models around
the country for what can work.

380
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,560
Boston has had a voluntary
program to send kids

381
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,720
from city
to schools in the suburbs.

382
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,560
It's tiny, but wildly popular.

383
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,280
Louisville has created a complicated
school-assignment formula

384
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,960
that has resulted
in more integrated schools.

385
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,680
It is not perfect
and they've had to tweak it a lot,

386
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,520
but under that program,

387
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,480
90% of kindergarten families still
receive their first choice of schools.

388
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,760
Impressive. 'Cause I doubt
90 percent of those families

389
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,760
even received their first
choice of kindergartner.

390
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,720
She's great. She draws on a lot
of things. But she's great.

391
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,120
She's absolutely fine.
She's no Dylan, of course.

392
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,120
Because as we all know,
Dylan is the best.

393
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,240
Everyone should be invested
in those sorts of solutions.

394
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,400
While this gets framed as an issue
about parents and their children,

395
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,280
it's actually about adults
and everybody.

396
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,440
Because kids grow up.
And those little doctors, soldiers,

397
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,080
police officers and superheroes asking
you for candy tomorrow,

398
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,920
in a decade or so, they
might be actual doctors,

399
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,120
soldiers, police officers and assistant
directors of human resources.

400
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,720
And there are massive
and multiple benefits for all of us

401
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,720
if they interacted more
from an early age.

402
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,960
I know this seems like a lot to ask,
but in the words of a small white child

403
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,080
dressed as a dead civil rights
leader, I have a dweam.

404
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,760
And now, this.

405
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,480
And now, Last Week Tonight asks:
how is this still a thing ?

406
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,120
This week, voting on Tuesday.
How is this still a thing ?

407
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,760
In the US, two things
are for certain.

408
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,400
Elections for national office
are held on the first Tuesday

409
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,560
after the first Monday
in November.

410
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,800
Second, every time it happens,
we're going to ask, why is that ?

411
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,080
When this question came up, none
of us knew why we vote on Tuesdays.

412
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,000
Ever wondered why
we vote on Tuesday ?

413
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:44,720
Election Day is always Tuesday,
but we wondered why.

414
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,240
And it's not just newscasters.
Nobody seems to know.

415
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,800
I do not know why elections
are on Tuesday.

416
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,920
On a Tuesday ?
I'm not sure.

417
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,400
- A good question, do you know ?
- I feel like I should, but no.

418
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,720
No.

419
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,920
Even human pickles don't know
why we vote on Tuesday.

420
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,880
It's one of those mysteries
no one can figure out,

421
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,400
like where's the remote ?

422
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,400
Or why doesn't Jason Bourne
just Google himself ?

423
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:14,520
The reason comes from an 1845 law,
passed for a very 1845 reason.

424
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:19,240
People had limited access to move
about polling stations.

425
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,280
They had to make Election Day a day
people could accommodate schedules.

426
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,000
Weekends were no good
because of the Sabbath.

427
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,520
So take Monday as a travel day
and voila, vote on Tuesdays.

428
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,920
We vote on Tuesdays because
of the Sabbath, making voting day

429
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,520
the only thing in American life
still scheduled around Sundays,

430
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,160
other than the operating hours
of Chick-fil-A

431
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,160
and new episodes of
America's Funniest Home Videos.

432
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,800
That's right motherfuckers,
that thing's still on.

433
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,000
And it'll be on long after
this nonsense is cancelled.

434
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,600
While many states allow
early voting or mail in voting,

435
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,880
13 states don't.

436
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:03,040
Having everyone vote at once on
a Tuesday can cause scenes like this.

437
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,520
In the Valley, high voter
turnout for Election Day.

438
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,440
This is video from
the Oakwood University precinct

439
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,000
where voters went in for upwards
of 3 hours to cast their ballots.

440
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,920
Lines have been long at polls
across central Mississippi tonight.

441
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,880
People waited for hours to cast their
ballots in the cold and the rain.

442
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,400
Here in East Flatbush,
the line to vote

443
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,200
stretched through the hall and
up the stairs, but there's more.

444
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,960
This auditorium of people
is the line to get on the line.

445
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,200
Holy shit.
All the wait times at Disney World,

446
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,840
all the fun of the fucking DMV,
and for some,

447
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,960
the fact voting takes place on
a workday is a major inconvenience.

448
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,080
On Tuesday I have to work
and I'm an hourly employee

449
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,720
and so any time taken away from
work, I have to wake up earlier.

450
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,000
Exactly. Perhaps that's why
the most common reason

451
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,160
Americans give for not voting is
that they were too busy.

452
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,120
Which means too busy working,
although it could mean

453
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,480
too busy coming up with
sick pool dunks like this one.

454
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:14,920
Because this is America. There is
all sorts of really cool shit to do.

455
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,760
What could be done ?
We could expand early voting,

456
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,000
move Election Day to a weekend,
or keep it where it is

457
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,320
and declare it a national holiday
like it is in Puerto Rico,

458
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,840
where their turnout is not only
higher than the 50 states,

459
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,760
but their voting day
is more awesome.

460
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,080
Until we do that, we're going
to be forced to squeeze in voting

461
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,440
in between work,
doctors appointments,

462
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,720
or a few quick
rim-rattling nerf dunks.

463
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,840
So farmers who have been dead
for more than a century

464
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,960
won't have an excuse
to miss church.

465
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,280
All of which returns us
to the question:

466
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,720
voting on Tuesday,
how is this still a thing ?

467
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:57,000
That's our show. Thanks for watching,
see you next week ! Good night !

468
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,280
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

469
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,720
END OF EPISODE 28,
SEASON III
