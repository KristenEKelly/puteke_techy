00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,320
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,720
SEASON III, EPISODE 18

3
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,880
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !
Thank you so much for joining us.

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,920
I'm John Oliver.
Time for a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,520
And we begin
with the 2016 presidential election,

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,960
or as you probably know it, America's
3D Imax Shit-Fit Dumpster Fire of 2016.

7
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,600
This week, the Republicans held
their convention more on that later.

8
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,480
Tomorrow, the Democrats' convention
begins, and it is off to a bumpy start.

9
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,640
Not because their chair
has announced plans to resign,

10
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,480
due to the contents
of thousands of leaked emails,

11
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,400
but also because Hillary's pick
for running mate of Tim Kaine

12
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,680
has not exactly inspired people.

13
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,600
He's a white guy,
who's a little boring.

14
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,040
He seems kind of dull.

15
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,480
He's somebody that has sort
of had the moniker of boring.

16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,720
Mayonnaise sandwich
on wheat bread.

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,240
Okay, we get it.
Tim Kaine is boring.

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,080
He's a white gym sock
pulled all the way up.

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,840
He's a granny smith apple
for dessert.

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,680
He's a single dry-hump
in the missionary position.

21
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,160
While some commentators
tried to fight that narrative,

22
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,640
it didn't really work.

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,720
Maybe he's not the most exciting
person in the world,

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,320
but he has a personality,
he really does.

25
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,520
We're making a lot
about Tim Kaine knowing Spanish.

26
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,560
He won the 2013 National Press Club
Centennial Spelling Bee.

27
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,320
He plays the harmonica,
an interesting fun fact.

28
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,280
Is it ? Is that a fun fact ?

29
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,560
Let's take a look at Tim Kaine
playing his harmonica,

30
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,480
and see exactly how fun it is.

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,040
That is a performance that would make
an insurance firm middle manager

32
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,240
say to his assistant: "Let's not
do the talent show next year."

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,800
There has been minimal excitement
from Democrats regarding Kaine pick.

34
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,920
Think of it like this: for months,
the party's been looking at the VP slot

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,400
as a gift that Hillary
was going to give them.

36
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,000
Everyone was so excited.
Was it a puppy ?

37
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,680
A PlayStation ? Elizabeth Warren ?

38
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,400
No !
It turned out to be a rice cooker.

39
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,400
A plain, white machine
that cooks plain, white rice.

40
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,240
That is what Tim Kaine is.
He's got instructions in Spanish,

41
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,080
and that's nice to have,
but he is still a fucking rice cooker.

42
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,600
Donald Trump also went with
a rice-cooker of a vice president.

43
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,560
Except it's worth remembering that
and it's crucial

44
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,320
Mike Pence is a rice cooker
covered in homophobic slogans

45
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,840
which is being held by a chimpanzee
who could bite your face off.

46
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,320
So... Relax, Democrats,
it could've been worse.

47
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,400
For now, let's move on to
the continuing fallout from Brexit

48
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,800
the name for both the UK's decision
to leave the EU,

49
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,200
and at least one baby in Brooklyn.

50
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,160
"Brexit, you put down your kombucha
and you come here."

51
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,320
Now, the UK has had
a dramatic few weeks.

52
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,960
David Cameron has stepped aside,
and Theresa May has taken over.

53
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,720
While it's clearly too early to know
what kind of leader she'll be,

54
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,400
one of her first appointments
was not really reassuring.

55
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,720
There were some surprises.

56
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,600
Former London Mayor Boris Johnson
is the new foreign secretary.

57
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,400
Yes, Boris Johnson...
A grown man

58
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,240
who looks like a problem child
at a day care center,

59
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,320
is now Britain's
new foreign secretary.

60
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,680
Boris Johnson ! A man
with horrifically poor judgment,

61
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,480
he wasn't Britain's most ardent
advocate for pulling out of the EU,

62
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,680
he may be its strongest argument
for pulling out in general.

63
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,160
"Pull out, Barnaby !

64
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,120
We don't want to make another Boris.
It would be ghastly."

65
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,280
Boris is a weird choice
for a diplomat.

66
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,480
Because, to put it mildly,
he has said a lot of dumb things.

67
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,640
As was pointed out

68
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,760
during a press conference
between him and John Kerry.

69
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,200
You've accused Barack Obama,
of harboring a part-Kenyan's,

70
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,000
quote, "ancestral dislike
for the British Empire," unquote.

71
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,840
You've described a possible
future president, Hillary Clinton,

72
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,800
as someone with
"dyed-blonde hair and pouty lips,

73
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,840
and a steely blue stare, like
a sadistic nurse in a mental hospital."

74
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,000
You've likened her to Lady Macbeth.
Do you take these comments back ?

75
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,200
It is not great when one of the first
questions you're being asked is,

76
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,720
"are you going to be as bad at your job
as all evidence suggests you will be ?"

77
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,680
Boris Johnson, a man whose face looks
like he quantum leaped into his body

78
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,480
and hasn't figured out who he is yet
had an answer, sort of.

79
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,360
I'm afraid that there is such a rich
thesaurus of things that I've said

80
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,600
that have been one way or another,
through what alchemy I do not know,

81
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,400
somehow misconstrued,

82
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,600
that it would really take me too long
to engage in a full global itinerary

83
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,000
of apology to all concerned.

84
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,680
That is the exact sound that
the Oxford English Dictionary makes

85
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,320
when you put it in a blender.

86
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,640
But while Boris Johnson,
a washed up scarecrow

87
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,400
who never thought to ask the wizard
for a brain, seems to think that

88
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,360
it'd take too long to adjudicate
the idiotic things he's said and done,

89
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,360
let me give you just a taste more
of Britain's new chief diplomat.

90
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,560
He's referred to Papua New
Guinea-style "orgies of cannibalism."

91
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,560
He's referred to Africans
using words I'm not going to repeat.

92
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,520
He's compared Vladimir Putin
to Dobby the house elf,

93
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,760
wrote a poem about the Turkish
president fucking a goat,

94
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,480
said the Chinese
have zero cultural influence,

95
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,400
and once got stuck on a zip line
while waving the British flag.

96
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,640
But at least in that example,
he's only hurting himself.

97
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,680
Specifically, his genitals,
or his "Boris Johnson", if you will.

98
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,120
Watch what he did
in an exhibition rugby match

99
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,360
to a 10-year-old Japanese child.

100
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,040
Boris Johnson might just be the
least-diplomatic diplomat in existence.

101
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,960
Which makes him perfect
for this job.

102
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,640
What better symbol
of centuries of British foreign policy

103
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,040
than a foppish buffoon stampeding
his way around the world,

104
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,680
knocking things over,
falling flat on his face,

105
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,600
and refusing to apologize ?

106
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,840
And now this !

107
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,680
A summary of Roger Ailes' contribution
to our political discourse.

108
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,160
We'd like to be premier journalists.

109
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,120
We'd like to restore objectivity
where we find it lacking.

110
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,520
We just expect to do fine,
balanced journalism.

111
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,760
Iraq is the first domino. The legal
basis for removing Saddam is there.

112
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,320
The image we have of poor people
as starving and living in squalor

113
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,320
really is not accurate.

114
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,960
Many of them have things. What
they lack is the richness of spirit.

115
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,320
Santa is what he is,
and so you know, Santa just is white.

116
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,640
Not all Muslims are terrorists,
but all terrorists are Muslim.

117
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,560
Barack Obama, raised as a Muslim.
This is huge.

118
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
What do you think ?

119
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,160
- Wednesdays are big days at Hooters.
- Huge days.

120
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,520
It's Wednesday, it's wings day.

121
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,520
And it goes Brian,
and there he's going down !

122
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,800
Run ! Geraldo !

123
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,000
- Newt Gingrich.
- Karl Rove.

124
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,040
- Sarah Palin.
- Mark Fuhrman.

125
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,920
- Jeremiah Wright.
- Saul Alinsky playbook.

126
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,280
War on Christmas.

127
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,800
- PC Police.
- Anti-white bias.

128
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,600
- The gay agenda.
- Nanny state.

129
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,400
- Long-form birth certificate.
- Apology tour.

130
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,840
- Death panel.
- Benghazi.

131
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,440
- New Black Panther party.
- Barack Hussein Obama.

132
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,440
- Ground zero mosque.
- Class warfare.

133
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,200
Terrorist fist jab.

134
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,840
That is an obscene lie,
that is an absolute misrep...

135
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,440
No filibuster !

136
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,560
- Let me add one other thing.
- Cheap political words.

137
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,520
This is justice.
You want anarchy.

138
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,920
I just love my country.
And I fear for it.

139
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,840
Roger Ailes
Fox News CEP 1996-2016

140
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,080
Moving on.
Our main story this week

141
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,560
concerns the Republican National
Convention in Cleveland.

142
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,600
The most apocalyptic thing
ever to happen to that city,

143
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,840
and bear in mind, their river
has repeatedly caught fire.

144
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,200
It has been over for a few days,
but we thought it might be worth

145
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,160
taking a few extra minutes to try
and figure out what the fuck happened.

146
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,280
You are dealing with a pretty
unconventional convention

147
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,600
when a speaker
opens with this statement.

148
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,440
My name is Dana White.

149
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,680
I am the president of the Ultimate
Fighting Championship.

150
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,080
The only way that would've made sense
is if his next words were,

151
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,560
"and I have clearly sleepwalked here,
please gently walk me from the stage

152
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,600
and return me to my family,
they are very worried."

153
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,360
He was actually there to speak
to Donald Trump's business acumen,

154
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,920
a repeated theme
throughout the whole week.

155
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,280
He gets stuff done.
Donald Trump is a proven leader.

156
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,080
Innovator. Entrepreneur.

157
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,280
When Donald Trump is in charge,

158
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,560
all that counts is ability,
effort and excellence.

159
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,960
He has created jobs
for thousands

160
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,240
and is one of the greatest visionaries
of our time.

161
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,040
Now, before you laugh, you cannot say
Trump isn't a visionary.

162
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,280
For a long time, he was the only one
who envisioned himself

163
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,920
as a presidential nominee.

164
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,000
He is what happens if "The Secret"
gets into the wrong hands.

165
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,240
That message of Trump as a skilled
manager was somewhat undercut

166
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,040
by the fact the entire convention
was a mismanaged shit-show.

167
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,360
From Melania Trump
using a partly-plagiarized speech,

168
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,160
to Ted Cruz being booed off the
stage for not endorsing Donald Trump,

169
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,960
to the fact that, supposedly,
Donald Trump knew

170
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,680
Ted Cruz wouldn't endorse him,
and didn't care.

171
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,040
The decision came
as no surprise to Trump, who tweeted:

172
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,280
"I saw his speech two hours early but
let him speak anyway. No big deal."

173
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,760
Yeah, but that's not reassuring.

174
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,840
If the captain of the Titanic
had tweeted after the fact,

175
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,160
"I saw that iceberg 2 hours before and
sailed into it anyway. No big deal !"

176
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,760
You wouldn't think,
that captain sure ran a tight ship !

177
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,960
But it's fitting that Trump
had seemingly done so little

178
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,280
to prepare
for his party's convention,

179
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,800
given that the party itself had done
so little to prepare for Donald Trump.

180
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,760
After the last election, the GOP
published a post-mortem report titled

181
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,360
the "Growth And Opportunity Project,"

182
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,520
analyzing their mistakes and laying
out a plan to expand their appeal.

183
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,120
It featured passages
like "many minorities

184
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,400
wrongly think that Republicans do not
like them or want them in the country,"

185
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,360
"we must emphasize the importance
of a welcoming, inclusive message

186
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,160
when discussing issues that relate
directly to a minority group."

187
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,680
Over the past year, that report and
its carefully considered suggestions

188
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,800
have been overshadowed
by a different report, titled

189
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,600
"Literally Everything Donald Trump
Has Ever Said And Done."

190
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,440
This is a guy who's suggested
building a wall to keep Mexicans out

191
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,080
and advocated a temporary ban
on Muslims entering the country.

192
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,480
So, it's like making a new year's
resolution to eat healthy,

193
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,840
and then spending the next
year only eating meals so large

194
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,480
that they're free if you eat them
in one sitting.

195
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,320
But amazingly, through all the chaos
and confusion this week,

196
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,000
one theme did emerge.

197
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,480
It was accidentally
summarized best,

198
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,480
and I can't believe I'm saying this
by Antonio Sabato Jr.,

199
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:17,600
an IMDB page-awarded actor, who
delivered a relatively restrained speech

200
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,360
before opening his heart regarding
President Obama to ABC News.

201
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,280
I don't believe
that the guy is a Christian,

202
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,920
I don't believe he follows the God
that I love and the Jesus that I love.

203
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,080
You believe
that President Obama is a Muslim ?

204
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,600
- That is based on what you feel ?
- That's what I believe, yeah.

205
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,440
I have the right to believe that and
you have the right to go against that.

206
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,640
Revealing isn't his mistaken belief
that President Obama is a Muslim.

207
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,480
It's also not the big shock
that Antonio Sabato, Jr.

208
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,280
star of the actual VH1
reality show "My Antonio"

209
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,200
is still both alive and an idiot.

210
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,600
What is revealing is his implication
that believing something to be true

211
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,600
is the same as it being true.

212
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,960
Because if anything, that was
the theme of the Republican convention.

213
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,400
It was a four-day exercise
in emphasizing feelings over facts.

214
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,880
People feel the Obama administration
has kicked them to the curb.

215
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,600
Our country right now is in a
very bad spot. You can feel it.

216
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,000
The vast majority of Americans
today do not feel safe.

217
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,400
A lot of Americans

218
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,800
feel like Democrat politicians
have taken them for granted.

219
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,200
The whole economy feels stuck.

220
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,800
What do you mean, "it feels stuck" ?
The economy is about numbers.

221
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,120
Feelings are supposed
to be irrelevant.

222
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,720
"Feelings are supposed
to be irrelevant"

223
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,200
is a phrase inscribed on
every British marriage certificate.

224
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:55,280
This focus on feelings reached
its apex in Donald Trump's speech,

225
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,760
light on concrete policy,
heavy on provoking strong emotions.

226
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,080
Decades of progress
made in bringing down crime

227
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,240
are now being reversed.

228
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:13,720
Corruption has reached a level like
never before in our country.

229
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,640
Poverty and violence at home,
war and destruction abroad.

230
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,080
180 000 illegal immigrants
with criminal records,

231
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,040
ordered deported from our country,
are roaming free

232
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,240
to threaten peaceful citizens.

233
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,000
Holy shit.

234
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,120
He's about to announce
the first annual Hunger Games.

235
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,960
It is worth noting that since
President Obama took office,

236
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,920
crime rates,
the flow of illegal immigrants

237
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and claims for unemployment
benefits have declined.

238
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,880
When reporters started pointing
that out, it didn't seem to matter.

239
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,760
Watch as Newt Gingrich
brushed off any effort

240
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,920
to fact-check Trump's claims
about the U.S. crime rate.

241
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,640
- Violent crime is down.
- It's not down in the biggest cities.

242
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,320
Violent crime,
murder rate is down.

243
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,600
How come it's up in Chicago,
Baltimore and Washington ?

244
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,440
There are pockets...

245
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,120
Your national capital,
your third biggest city...

246
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,040
Across the country is down.

247
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,680
The average American does not
think crime is down,

248
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,480
does not think they are safer.

249
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,560
- We are safer, and it is down.
- No, that's your view.

250
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,800
- These are national FBI facts.
- What I said is also a fact.

251
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,680
No, it isn't !

252
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,480
It's only a fact that that's
a feeling people have.

253
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,400
This is a graph of the violent crime
rate, not a Rorschach test.

254
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,360
You can't infer anything
you like from it.

255
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,440
You can cherry-pick recent
upticks in some cities,

256
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,920
but the overall trend
during the Obama presidency

257
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,280
and for the last 25 years
is down.

258
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,320
But Newt wasn't done.

259
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,120
Liberals have a set of statistics

260
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,560
which may be right,
but it's not where human beings are.

261
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,400
Hold on, you're saying liberals
use these numbers,

262
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,360
they use this magic math,
this is the FBI statistics.

263
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,200
- They're not a liberal organization.
- What I said is equally true.

264
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,080
- People feel it.
- Yes, but the facts don't support it.

265
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,680
I'll go with how people feel and I'll
let you go with the theoreticians.

266
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,800
He brought a feeling
to a fucking fact-fight !

267
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:37,360
And it is worth taking a moment
to consider what Gingrich was saying.

268
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,000
I think we can all agree candidates
can create feelings in people.

269
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,280
Gingrich is saying that feelings
are as valid as facts.

270
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,680
By the transitive property,
candidates can create facts.

271
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,840
Terrifying. That means
someone like Donald Trump

272
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,320
can essentially create
his own reality.

273
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,960
That is the closest thing to an actual
magic spell I think I've ever seen.

274
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,080
If you're thinking:
"eventually, reality will set in,"

275
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,400
"because if elected, Trump would
have to deal with facts."

276
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,720
I'm not so sure about that.
Not only was John Kasich asked

277
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,360
if he had interest in the
vice presidency by the Trump campaign,

278
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,240
he was offered quite a lot more.

279
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,560
Donald Trump Jr. even called
one of John Kasich's top aides

280
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,960
and said that if he wanted the job,
he could even be in charge

281
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,680
of foreign and domestic policy,
which is kind of everything.

282
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,400
Yeah, exactly !

283
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,720
The only thing that is not foreign
or domestic policy is "space policy".

284
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,640
Which leads me to believe
Trump's entire goal

285
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,400
is to eventually own the moon.

286
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,160
When Kasich's adviser asked what
Trump would be in charge of,

287
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,440
the response was:
"making America great again."

288
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,720
Which, objectively, is not a job.
But I guess it feels like one

289
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,680
and it seems that's all
that fucking matters now.

290
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,440
The Trump family disputed
that story, naturally.

291
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,400
But it does often seem like Trump
is more interested in attention,

292
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,720
than the hard work of getting things
done in a complicated political system.

293
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,320
Last night, he tweeted out
what seemed to be

294
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,680
his main takeaway
from this convention.

295
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,440
75 Minutes - Total Speech Time

296
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,840
24 Minutes - Total Applause

297
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,600
33% - Time Spent Applauding

298
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,520
Okay...

299
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,480
First, 24 out of 75
is 32 percent, not 33,

300
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,680
but that doesn't matter,
that clearly doesn't matter.

301
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,400
The notion that Donald Trump
would be a hands-off president

302
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,640
might actually represent
the best-case scenario here.

303
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,320
The much more frightening prospect
would be if he were hands-on.

304
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,640
Between those 24 minutes of applause

305
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,440
was a symphony of bile
and race-baiting.

306
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,720
This is a man who has
retaliated against journalists,

307
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,600
has advocated
killing terrorists' families,

308
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,280
endorsed torture,
and expressed admiration

309
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,960
for leaders like Kim Jong Un,
Saddam Hussein and Vladimir Putin.

310
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,480
His message this week was the
message of every strong man ever:

311
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,680
"The world is dangerous
and only I can make you safe."

312
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,520
And if that sounds scary,
there have been warning signs.

313
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,680
Just watch this DVD extra from
the first season of "The Apprentice".

314
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,920
It's a music video they made

315
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,520
and it gives you a sense of how
Trump envisions himself.

316
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,240
This is a dictatorship.
And I'm the dictator.

317
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,600
There's no voting.
There's no jury.

318
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,480
Dictator. No jury.

319
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,080
Sure, it's funny now to hear him
say he's a dictator

320
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,000
as a voice in the background says:
"slave to the master" over and over.

321
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,480
But unless we're careful,
by this time next year,

322
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,120
that could be America's
new national anthem.

323
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,880
And now this...

324
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,160
And now, a few more highlights from
the Republican National Convention.

325
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,840
What's up, GOP ?

326
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,880
I come from a long line
of lumberjacks.

327
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,120
My dream was to be
a circus performer.

328
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,800
I'm now an avocado grower.

329
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,880
Who's proud to be an American ?

330
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,120
We don't apologize for America.
We celebrate America.

331
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,920
From the top to the bottom,
from the middle to the side.

332
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,000
ISIS is present in all 50 states.

333
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,080
Crooked Hillary Clinton,
leave this race now !

334
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,640
A day in the life of a coal miner and
a day in the life of Hillary Clinton

335
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,240
could not be more different.

336
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,960
Are we willing to elect someone
as president

337
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,240
who has as their role model
somebody who acknowledges Lucifer ?

338
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,080
We have in our hands
the steering wheel

339
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,800
of one of the one political party
in this country

340
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,000
that, no matter what ever turn,
whether we turn bumpy roads,

341
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,640
but we are not going to turn left.

342
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,600
Or, as Larry the Cable Guy
would say: let's git'er done.

343
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,880
Mr. Trump is America's
blue-collar billionaire.

344
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,280
Is Donald Trump a messiah ?
No. He's just a man.

345
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:38,640
A man I love so much.
That's my father.

346
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,480
Come January 17, all things
will be possible again.

347
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,680
Visit yrnf.org and dot...

348
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,520
And we will make
America great again.

349
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,360
And finally this week...

350
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,440
There were clearly many
mistakes made at the RNC,

351
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,600
but I'd like to mention
just one more,

352
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,120
regarding Trump's choice of song
for his entrance on Monday.

353
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,560
Yes, that is Queen being played at
the Republican National Convention.

354
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,800
With a heavy heart I announce:

355
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,200
Freddie Mercury,
dead again at age 69.

356
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,880
Queen didn't give Trump permission
to use that song,

357
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,640
tweeting it was "an unauthorized use
at the Republican Convention."

358
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,680
And yet, on his closing night,
Trump used another unauthorized song

359
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:45,000
to cover him dropping an almost
sarcastic amount of balloons.

360
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,320
And you will never
guess what song it was.

361
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,080
You can't always get what you want !

362
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,640
No shit.

363
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,520
Trump has used unauthorized music
throughout his campaign.

364
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,280
If you think
"You Can't Always Get What You Want"

365
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,120
was a bit on-the-nose,
just wait until you hear

366
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,880
what song he used ahead of a speech
he gave on the Iran nuclear deal.

367
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,840
This is real, we did not alter
the audio at all.

368
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,520
Businessman Donald Trump.

369
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,880
It's the end of the world
as we know it !

370
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,880
I mean, that is just too perfect.

371
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,040
Trump may as well have been
riding out on stage

372
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,840
with three other horsemen
of the apocalypse.

373
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,280
It is by no means just Trump
who angered musicians.

374
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,000
Mike Huckabee pissed off Survivor
by using "Eye of the Tiger",

375
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,240
and Scott Walker had this happen.

376
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,600
After Wisconsin Governor
Scott Walker used music

377
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,200
from the Dropkick Murphys,
they tweeted: "we literally hate you."

378
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,680
They may be angry,
Boston hooligans,

379
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,280
but I'll say this about
the Dropkick Murphys:

380
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,160
they know when to properly use
the word literally.

381
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,480
None of this is new, politicians
have been appropriating pop music

382
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,680
for as long as anyone can remember.

383
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,680
Sarah Palin has gotten in trouble
for using Heart's "Barracuda",

384
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,440
John McCain was asked to stop using
two John Mellencamp songs,

385
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,160
the DNC was criticized by Cyndi Lauper
for using "True Colors",

386
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,840
and most famously,
three decades ago, there was this.

387
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,640
Ronald Reagan used the song
"Born in the USA" in 1984

388
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,960
for his reelection campaign until
Springsteen suggested

389
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,960
he should listen
to the lyrics.

390
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,440
Springsteen penned the tune about
the dark side of the American story

391
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,040
and the harsh treatment
of Vietnam veterans.

392
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,560
To be fair to Reagan,
most people don't realize that.

393
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,680
I assumed that,
like every other Springsteen song,

394
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,600
it was about strugglin' heroes and
their barefoot lovers, named Mary,

395
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,720
who broke free of that town
on bikes chased by shadows.

396
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,800
But, the point here is:

397
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,200
if artists want to lend their
music to politicians, that's fine.

398
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,040
But it is not okay for politicians
to just take their songs.

399
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,600
This happens every single election

400
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,480
and it is time for musicians
to come together and take a stand.

401
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,680
It's that time of year,

402
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,600
Campaign season's here.

403
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:39,400
You'll wave and make your speeches
While balloons fall everywhere.

404
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,880
We've noticed something's wrong,

405
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,160
And it's gone on way too long.

406
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,280
So we're asking you right now:
Stop using our songs.

407
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,920
Turn on your laser light show,
Fire up your confetti machine.

408
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,160
Bring out your smiling backdrop
Of "ethnically diverse teens."

409
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:13,440
Stop using our music.
That's our one and only rule.

410
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:19,120
We didn't write these songs to make
Your campaign stop seem cool.

411
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:24,560
Don't use our song,
'Cause you used it wrong.

412
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,720
It might seem appealing,

413
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,000
But you're just stealing.

414
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,120
Don't use our song.
It just seems wrong.

415
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:43,360
By the time this tune is through,
You'll be lucky if we don't sue.

416
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,840
Don't use our song, no.

417
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,120
That's licensing.
You gotta call my publisher, okay ?

418
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,520
You always take our music
Out of context anyway.

419
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:03,600
Why would Reagan be playing
"Born in the USA" ?

420
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,360
It's about Vietnam.

421
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,480
And thank you for not paying me.

422
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,720
That's a license you didn't buy.

423
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,960
If I wanted to sing and not get paid,

424
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,480
I'd be on Spotify.

425
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:23,800
Don't use our song.
I mean, come on !

426
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:30,360
You knew we'd find out.
This is like the 6th time now.

427
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:36,360
Don't use our song, no, no.
'Cause it's not your song.

428
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,480
You're lucky we don't sue.

429
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,040
What's the deal
With all those balloons ?

430
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,840
Don't use our song !

431
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,600
And just to be clearer,
You can't use this song either.

432
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:59,720
But here's one tune we all agree
That you can use anytime for free.

433
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,560
- Don't use our song.
- All right, come on, y'all.

434
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,320
- For real, come on.
- Don't you use it !

435
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,240
You're lucky if we don't sue.

436
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,200
And what's the deal
With all those balloons ?

437
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,520
- Don't use our song.
- Stop using my song !

438
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,320
You all sing along.

439
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,600
It might seem appealing.

440
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,000
But you're just stealing.

441
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,920
Don't use our song.
You know it's wrong.

442
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,440
The crowd might like it.
But you didn't write it.

443
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,160
Don't do it !

444
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,800
'Cause you know
You're fucking stealing !

445
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,480
Don't use our song !

446
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,120
That's our show, thank you so much,
see you next week. Good night !

447
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,440
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

448
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,320
END OF EPISODE 18,
SEASON III
