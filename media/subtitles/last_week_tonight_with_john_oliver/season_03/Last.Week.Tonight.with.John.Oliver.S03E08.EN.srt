00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,360
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,360
SEASON III
EPISODE 8

3
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,280
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,640
Thank you for joining us.
A quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,200
And we begin with Panama.
A country you think about so little,

6
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,520
you don't realize that's not Panama,
that's the outline of a Scottie dog.

7
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,040
This is Panama.

8
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,560
Panama caught the world's attention
this week in a big way.

9
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,720
We turn to the banking bombshell
causing shock waves around the world,

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,600
the so-called Panama papers.

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,440
It's one of the biggest
data leaks in history,

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,120
11.5 million documents,
blowing the lid

13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,240
off some of the world's most powerful
people and their offshore billions.

14
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,920
This is absolutely huge, because the
lid on billionaires' offshore accounts

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,040
is similar to the lid on a yogurt that's
been in the fridge for three years.

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,400
If that lid comes off, stand back;
you're about to see some nasty shit.

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,640
"Panama Papers" are documents
from a law firm called Mossack-Fonseca

18
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,720
which specialized
in creating offshore accounts.

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,840
This story is going to take months
to unfold,

20
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,680
but it's already
inflicting casualties.

21
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,120
The documents

22
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,840
linked Iceland's prime minister
Sigmundur David Gunnlauggson

23
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,840
to a shell company called Wintris,
which held millions of dollars.

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,440
Watch his body language as a reporter
brings it up for the very first time.

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,720
What can you tell me
about a company called Wintris ?

26
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,960
It's a company, if I recall correctly,

27
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,640
which is associated with one of the
companies that I was on the board of.

28
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,360
And it was, had an account
which as I, as I mentioned

29
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,760
has been with the tax, on the tax
account since it was established.

30
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,240
Holy shit, that, that is like watching
a slow motion car crash.

31
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,000
Or as they say in Iceland,
a slow motion car crash.

32
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,440
Come on, guys,
they have cars in Iceland.

33
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,400
It's a modern Nordic island nation,
and their English is excellent.

34
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,560
But Iceland has only just recovered
from a huge economic downturn,

35
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,120
so its citizens
were understandably upset.

36
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,160
They've been throwing eggs
and bananas at the parliament.

37
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,400
- They're throwing things...
- Yes.

38
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,680
- Can you believe it ?
- They have not thrown enough.

39
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,280
Eggs and bananas. They're either
angry at the Prime Minister

40
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,680
or encouraging him
to get on a paleo diet.

41
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,920
And yes, I know that there's some
controversy in the paleo community

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,360
about whether or not
bananas are paleo,

43
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,200
but if you are infuriated by that joke,
please know: you're a terrible person.

44
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,920
You're just terrible.

45
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,440
And the point is just days
after those protests,

46
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,520
the Prime Minister was replaced
by the fisheries minister,

47
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,960
because it seems in Iceland,
the line of succession goes...

48
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,560
Prime Minister,
the guy in charge of the fish,

49
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,200
the secretary
of licorice flavored schnapps,

50
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,000
a litany of elves
that live in assorted boulders,

51
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,640
and finally anybody in a wool sweater
who's feeling political.

52
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,120
And if you're thinking, c'mon,
how could he leave out Bjork ?

53
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,760
I didn't. She was one of the elves.
Pay attention !

54
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,640
And look: it was not only
the leader of Iceland in trouble.

55
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,560
The presidents of Argentina, Ukraine
and the king of Saudi Arabia,

56
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,840
among others, were directly linked,
while UK Prime Minister David Cameron

57
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,000
was accused of benefiting from
his father's revealed investment fund,

58
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,600
an accusation
that he vigorously denied.

59
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,800
In terms of my own financial affairs,
I own no shares.

60
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,120
I have no shares, no offshore trusts,
no offshore funds, nothing like that.

61
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,840
"I own no shares." If the present
tense there seems a little suspicious,

62
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,160
it might be
because it later turned out,

63
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,000
he had owned shares,
he'd just sold them.

64
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,880
So saying "I own no shares"
is not really the whole story.

65
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,880
It's a bit like A-Rod saying
he has no steroids in his body.

66
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,480
Sure, that's true, now. But it wasn't
always the case, was it ?

67
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,880
And that's kind of the point.
It seems incredible

68
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,600
that in a story featuring
world leaders and possible corruption,

69
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,800
we have not yet heard
the name Vladimir Putin in all this.

70
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,760
Just wait. Because
while he was not directly linked

71
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,680
to any companies in the documents,
that may not mean he's not involved.

72
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,560
Investigators say
these documents are a road map

73
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,280
to how Putin
could have stashed away billions,

74
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,240
the papers point to this cellist,
Sergei Roldugin,

75
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,400
godfather to Putin's daughter.

76
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,080
The papers revealed the identity
of a suspiciously rich cellist,

77
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,720
which raises
immediate red flags for me,

78
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,440
because I always thought the only
way to make millions with a cello

79
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,480
is to use it to dig for gold.

80
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,320
And, and also, if cellists
are really that good at investing,

81
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,280
then someone should get frankly
Yo-Yo Ma to run a stock-tip hotline.

82
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,360
Except, don't worry,
'cause we've already done it.

83
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,040
Hi, I'm Yo-Yo Ma. And you've
reached my investment hotline.

84
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,720
Today I've got one main tip:
buy cellos. Cellos are great.

85
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,440
If you practice on one long enough,
you can make it sound like this.

86
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,920
I love cellos !

87
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,800
He does !
The guy loves cellos !

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,920
The law firm involved here has not
yet been charged with any crime.

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,200
But it is hard to believe
they didn't see any warning signs

90
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,640
when they incorporated
actual companies

91
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,000
named Goldfinger, Goldeneye,
Moonraker, Spectre and Blofeld.

92
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,680
All famously associated
with James Bond villains.

93
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,720
I can't think of anything
more inherently suspicious than that,

94
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,520
other than perhaps the phrase

95
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,760
"Vladimir Putin's
multimillionaire cellist friend."

96
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,280
For now,
let's move on to Alabama,

97
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,320
a state whose very flag
is the universal sign for:

98
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,520
"No. Absolutely not.
Under no circumstances."

99
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,520
Their governor has been in the news,
due to a sordid scandal.

100
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,720
Alabama governor Robert Bentley
under fire, but refusing to resign

101
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,360
after being accused of an affair with
one of his top aides, Rebekah Mason.

102
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,320
The allegations surfaced

103
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,760
after sexually explicit recordings
of him became public.

104
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,680
When I stand behind you,

105
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,480
and I put my arms around you,
and I put my hands on your breasts,

106
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,720
and I put my hands on you
and just, and pull you close.

107
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,400
I love that too.

108
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,360
He says that like an 8th grader

109
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,680
trying to convince the boys'
locker room he's had sex...

110
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,200
"I stood behind her, I put my hands
on her boobs and we were done."

111
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,080
"Then she yelled 'hooray !
You're the best person at sex !"

112
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,200
"It happened. We did sex, y'all!"

113
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,560
Bentley denies a physical affair, but
there have been moves to impeach him,

114
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,920
including charges that, in the course
of the affair, he used state property.

115
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
There's one piece of property that,

116
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,000
according to someone who heard
the tapes, might have been involved.

117
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,040
It's stunning,
it really is when you hear it,

118
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,680
Governor Bentley describing
encounters with Mrs. Mason.

119
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,000
They made the comment
that if we're going to do this again,

120
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,880
we're going to have to move Wanda's
desk farther away from the door,

121
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,160
Wanda being
his executive assistant

122
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,400
whose office is just right
off of the governor's office.

123
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,960
Don't bring Wanda's desk into this.
You know what ?

124
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,000
Wanda is the real victim here,

125
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,440
and if the governor
will not apologize to her, I will.

126
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,040
Wanda. I am sorry you got dragged
into this shit.

127
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,760
You didn't get into public service

128
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,200
to listen to sound of
a 73-year-old man groping a staffer.

129
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,480
So to make it up to you,
we're sending an Edible Arrangements

130
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,880
"I'm berry sorry" fruit box to your
desk tomorrow, wherever it is now.

131
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,000
You enjoy it, Wanda.
You enjoy it.

132
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,880
This impeachment process alone

133
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,320
shows how bad things
currently are in Alabama politics.

134
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,640
The articles of impeachment must be
presented by the Speaker of the House.

135
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,280
Mike Hubbard, who is currently
awaiting trial on 23 felony charges.

136
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,040
The trial would be presided
by the Chief Justice Roy Moore,

137
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,960
who was once removed from office,
for the dumbest possible reason.

138
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,320
Moore was charged with six counts
of ethically violating his office

139
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,960
for refusing to remove a stone
depiction of the Ten Commandments

140
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,600
he had placed
in the Supreme Court's rotunda.

141
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,200
It's true.

142
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,640
The Speaker of the House,
who is facing felony charges,

143
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,080
will present
the Articles of Impeachment

144
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,480
to the governor,
accused of a sex scandal.

145
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,160
The thing will be presided
by the Chief Justice,

146
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,440
who was once removed
from office for ethics violations.

147
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,600
This is either a grave insult
to the state of Alabama,

148
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,280
or the most Alabama
thing that state has ever done.

149
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,880
And now this !

150
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,080
Some fans who have never sat
in a premium location.

151
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,800
Take a look at these fans
at Tuesday's Astros-Yankees game.

152
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,960
They are dressed
as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

153
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,920
John Oliver filled some seats,
selling the tickets for just 25 cents.

154
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,520
A pair of fans in unicorn costumes,
another pair in shark costumes.

155
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,680
Two guys dressed as dinosaurs,

156
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,360
they sat in the front row and they
got on the center field video board.

157
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,560
Dancing sharks here
at Yankee stadium.

158
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,320
And the pitch,
swing and miss, got 'em!

159
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,400
Raphael, Donatello, Michelangelo,
some Ninja Turtles.

160
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,600
So there was a contest put on
by HBO's Jon Stewart.

161
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,480
Moving on !

162
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,200
Our main story tonight
concerns credit reports.

163
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,640
The basis for the single most
important 3-digit number in your life,

164
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,040
other than, of course, 311,
the Beatles of rap-rock.

165
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,720
Measuring credit enables businesses
to know who to lend to.

166
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,840
It's critical to our economy.
And it always has been.

167
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,040
Millions of people use credit to buy
things that add up to a better living.

168
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,560
There's a lot of things
I'd like to buy !

169
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,640
How about giving me
a little credit ?

170
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,640
Nobody gives you credit, John.
It's something you have to earn.

171
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,400
To earn credit, first you have
to develop your character.

172
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,440
You have to have capacity
to pay your bills

173
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,760
and third,
you need some capital.

174
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,440
Scoring high on the 3 c's is essential
to earn a good credit rating.

175
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,880
Back then, there was a fourth "c"
determining your access to credit,

176
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,640
namely, what color you were.

177
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,760
It's a little bit weird
that one didn't make the movie.

178
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,720
But you might be surprised

179
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,520
at how many aspects of your
life your credit report can affect.

180
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,160
It's banks deciding
whether to lend you money,

181
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,160
landlords deciding
whether to rent you an apartment,

182
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,000
insurers setting your rates,

183
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,640
and even employers using it
to decide whether or not to hire you.

184
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,440
47 percent of employers do conduct
credit checks on new potential hires.

185
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,280
And it is legal if the employer
gets permission from the applicant.

186
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,360
Nearly half of employers delve
into credit histories when hiring.

187
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,360
You'll find credit checks are required
in all sorts of job listings,

188
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,120
from managing
a Benihana in Cincinnati,

189
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,200
to this one, which reads,
"Who runs those fireworks tents ?"

190
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,400
"It could be you ! Application
with good credit check required."

191
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,320
Which is ridiculous. They don't need
to bring credit into that job.

192
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,160
They just need to ask the question,
"What do you think of fireworks ?"

193
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,560
And then hear the answer,
"Fireworks are fuckin' sick, bro."

194
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,080
"I fuckin' love
lighting those fuckers."

195
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,200
The only 3 digits they need to see are
the ones on that person's two hands.

196
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,120
There are three big
credit-reporting firms:

197
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,960
Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.

198
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,200
All three aggressively market their
products for uses beyond lending.

199
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,760
Listen to how Experian
convinces employers

200
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,120
that your credit may reflect
your future job performance.

201
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,120
If you manage your credit well,

202
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,320
then you're going to manage
the company's money well.

203
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,920
Is it, though? Because, look at me.
My credit is probably fine,

204
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,120
but I routinely waste HBO's money
on stupid costumes,

205
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,360
pyrotechnic displays,
and checkered dress shirts.

206
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,160
I clearly cannot manage
this company's money well.

207
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:58,320
Now as for TransUnion, their website
explicitly states that credit reports

208
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,320
"help employers
make decisions quickly and easily"

209
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,800
"when deciding
on potential candidates".

210
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,960
Surprising given this exchange between
a representative from TransUnion

211
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,480
and an Oregon legislator.

212
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,960
What is the evidence
that there's a strong correlation

213
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,680
between accessing
an applicant's credit history

214
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,760
and eventual problems of loss
to the employer or to the clients,

215
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,080
I guess, in that case ?

216
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:29,360
We don't have any research
to show any statistical correlation

217
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,440
between what's in somebody's
credit report

218
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,440
and their job performance
or their likelihood to commit fraud.

219
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,480
Okay, so they admit there is
no evidence of a correlation.

220
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,920
Which does make sense.
A good credit score

221
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,760
could either mean
you're unlikely to commit fraud,

222
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,760
but it could mean that you're amazing,
and you've never been caught.

223
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,520
Incidentally, not 30 seconds later,
that guy said this...

224
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,480
Given all things equal between
two or three job applicants,

225
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,280
if a person has a high amount of debt
versus somebody who doesn't,

226
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,280
and all things other being equal,
maybe they wanna consider that.

227
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:13,080
He says: "No proof of a correlation,
but you're free to imagine there is."

228
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,320
I can imagine that eating alphabet
soup will increase my vocabulary.

229
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,720
That does not make it indubitable.
Indubitable !

230
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,760
I knew I ate a lot of letters
yesterday ! Indubitable !

231
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,720
Giving too much credence to credit
reports as a measure of character

232
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,440
may be a big mistake.

233
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,120
Over half the debt on the credit
reports comes from medical expenses.

234
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,800
Seems unfair to judge someone for
that, no one chooses to be sick,

235
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,640
with the exception of Julianne Moore
taking a run at best actress.

236
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,560
Credit reports can contain
a shocking number of errors.

237
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:59,640
25% of consumers have an error
in one of their credit reports.

238
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,360
The study also found about
one in twenty had errors

239
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,960
that could cause them to pay more
for a car loan or a mortgage.

240
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,400
One in four had an error. And one
in 20 were seriously wrong.

241
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,520
If every
20th frosty that Wendy's sold

242
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,160
turned out to be a cup
of warm goat semen...

243
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,800
We would want some accountability
and fast. At least freeze it !

244
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,280
Those errors can be anything
from including debt you've repaid

245
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,760
to mixing you up
with someone else.

246
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:39,680
Take what happened to Judy Thomas.
She kept getting turned down for loans

247
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,000
until she looked
at her credit report.

248
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:48,440
I saw debt from Utah Medical Center,
from a veterinarian clinic in Utah.

249
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,880
I saw collections
for a Judith Kendall.

250
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,880
Judith Kendall ? Not Judy Thomas ?
What's going through your mind ?

251
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,400
What she doing on my credit report ?
Why is her debt on my credit report ?

252
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,640
How can someone called Judy Thomas
be mixed up with Judith Kendall ?

253
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,920
If she's going to be mistaken,
how is it not Leslie Stahl ?

254
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:19,640
Because that is spooky.
And it actually gets worse.

255
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:25,240
If an agency matches your name
to a list of suspect criminals,

256
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,600
as they did with Amit Patel, you may
be in for an unpleasant surprise.

257
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,680
After being denied his dream apartment
he asked his landlord why.

258
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,160
As an answer, the landlord
forwarded his credit report.

259
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,960
- What does that say ?
- Terrorist.

260
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,040
Holy shit.

261
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,480
That is terrible,
because he is not a terrorist.

262
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,360
I do hope we have a better
strategy for dealing with terrorists

263
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,840
than flagging their credit reports
and denying their dream apartments.

264
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,840
Not in America !
Being mixed up with a terrorist

265
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,200
is not the worst thing a credit
bureau can do to someone.

266
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,840
Helen McGill was shocked when
she went to buy a travel trailer,

267
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,320
to learn she was dead.

268
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,320
The financial manager said:
"do you have a copy of your card"

269
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,000
"because you keep
coming up deceased ?"

270
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,280
I was like, there's no way.

271
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,120
Three credit bureaus
listed her as deceased.

272
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,960
I even paid at that point,
to get my credit score,

273
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,280
you can't get anything when you're
deceased, you don't even exist.

274
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,680
Just one error on your credit report,
and the world treats you

275
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,640
like a mean girl treats
the high school debate team:

276
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,840
"You're nothing, Amberly.
You don't even exist."

277
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,320
It would be bad enough if this just
involved the three big credit bureaus.

278
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:59,200
There are now hundreds of companies
providing broader "background checks"

279
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,760
which may bundle credit information
with criminal or driving records.

280
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,800
While some companies
appear to operate responsibly,

281
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,360
others, like general information
services, or GIS,

282
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,760
do things that make you doubt
their judgment.

283
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,520
We found this video, featuring
Snow White coming to them for help.

284
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,040
Now fairytale isn't an industry
that we specialize in

285
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,800
but lucky for you our magic mirror
can find anything worth locating,

286
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,320
if only you were
in the insurance industry.

287
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,280
We created tons of solutions
for those guys.

288
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,080
- Was that a fairy ?
- We're an equal opportunity employer.

289
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,960
Hold up. Was that
a homophobic fairy joke ?

290
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,160
It's hard to accept judgment from a
company that would do that,

291
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,080
let alone deliver it with the
acting skills of a shy third grader.

292
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:04,240
Agencies can take the problems of
credit reporting, adding a few more.

293
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,760
As we've discussed, a criminal
record does not necessarily mean

294
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,640
you're a bad person
or that you shouldn't be hired.

295
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,680
If you are going to use
a criminal background check

296
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,760
to make decisions, at the very least,
they should be accurate,

297
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,760
and frequently, they are not.

298
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:27,400
Take Samuel Jackson from Chicago.
No relation to the actor, obviously,

299
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,360
or to the 3 different sex offenders
one company confused him with,

300
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,080
even though one of those
convictions happened

301
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,920
when Jackson was just 3 years old
or, as his lawyer puts it:

302
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,600
The company was aware that
Mr. Jackson is only 30-years-old,

303
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,480
and he couldn't be all three
sex offenders at the same time.

304
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,480
Of course not.
There's only one person

305
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,640
who could be three sex
offenders at the same time,

306
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,840
that is Mr. Neil Patrick Harris.

307
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,160
Not saying he is, but he has
got the performance chops

308
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,240
to make you believe
it is possible,

309
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,240
if he put his mind to it, he could
be the literal triple threat.

310
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,600
He's that good,
he's that good a performer.

311
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,280
These mistakes can cost
people housing and jobs.

312
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,880
No wonder many firms have
wound up facing legal challenges.

313
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,600
Last year, GIS and their affiliate
had to jizz out

314
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,040
$13 million in fines and damages.

315
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,400
They admit no wrongdoing,
they've now lost so much money,

316
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,720
their next video is going to be
a filthy parrot in an old warehouse

317
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,440
screaming:
"Polly wants a background check."

318
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,000
You are probably thinking:

319
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,640
"I should check my background
and credit reports."

320
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,320
Under a law called
the Fair Credit Reporting Act,

321
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,600
the big credit firms are required
to give you a copy once a year,

322
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,600
and there's an official site
where you can get yours.

323
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,160
But if you do spot an error,
your trouble may just be beginning.

324
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,160
Remember Judy Thomas ? It took her
a long time to get her credit fixed.

325
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:12,920
It became a six-year battle
with credit agencies,

326
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:18,600
to try and prove that she was
Judy Thomas, not Judith Kendall.

327
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,520
I also hired a local attorney to try
and straighten it out.

328
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,920
We had everything certified
that this is Judy Thomas.

329
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,240
This is where I live. I've never
gone by the name of Kendall.

330
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:37,040
I've never even been to Utah, let
alone owing a cable company in Utah.

331
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,080
- What happened ?
- Nothing.

332
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,680
I'm surprised she didn't just go:
"Fuck it. I'm Judith Kendall."

333
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,720
"I'm moving to Utah and I'm getting
a sick pet and a cable package."

334
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,240
"At least then, my life will make
some fucking sense to me."

335
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,920
It is not surprising that
when we crunched the numbers,

336
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,000
the three big
credit bureaus have been the subject

337
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,000
of the most complaints to
the CFPB since the start of last year.

338
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,160
They may say that sometimes, they
receive inaccurate data from creditors

339
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,560
but if that's true, their method for
resolving problems needs to be better.

340
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,480
And in a settlement agreement

341
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,880
they pledged to improve
their dispute resolution process.

342
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,880
Before you get too hopeful,
it's worth noting:

343
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,280
Industry claimed for decades they
are always improving their accuracy.

344
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,800
For 25 years now, the news stories
about them have a similar tone.

345
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:43,240
A study said 25% of credit reports
had errors to deny you credit.

346
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,240
A staggering number of credit
reports contain mistakes.

347
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,160
A new study says credit reports
have errors costly for consumers.

348
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:58,400
A survey found nearly one third
of credit reports contained errors.

349
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,560
You don't have to spend long preparing
a broadcast about credit agencies

350
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,960
before you learn one simple truth:
everyone has a horror story.

351
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:13,160
It's obvious that problems with credit
agencies are a classic story trope.

352
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,880
Like "oldest person dies", or
"scary new teen sex trends."

353
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,160
Coming up: we've all heard
of 'Netflix and chill',

354
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,960
but what does it mean when your teen
is going to 'Hulu and rimjob'?"

355
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,800
It is not as innocent
as it sounds !

356
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,640
There is nothing new
about this problem.

357
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,800
When we were researching
Judy Thomas's story,

358
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,480
we found a news clip about a lawsuit
from 2002 that gave us deja vu.

359
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,360
It was the culmination of a six
year battle for Judy Thomas,

360
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,320
who tried to get Transunion to clear
up mistakes on her credit report.

361
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,280
Another Judy Thomas !

362
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:58,320
Judy Thomas was not even the only
Judy Thomas this had happened to !

363
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:04,840
If you or someone you know is
named Judy Thomas: give up.

364
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,400
There is no hope in life
for Judys like you.

365
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,200
Things are even worse
with background check companies.

366
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,360
They are also required to give you
a copy of your report.

367
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,520
There's a massive loophole,
unlike the credit bureaus,

368
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,000
most of them don't keep
files on all consumers,

369
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,960
they search for data
when someone pays them to.

370
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,760
If you're about to apply
for a job or an apartment,

371
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:35,160
you might think: "I want to be sure
there isn't a problem on my report,"

372
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,440
"so I'll just buy it first myself".

373
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,880
We asked companies if they'd let
us do that, and they all said no.

374
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,200
Meaning, if they confuse you
with a sex offender,

375
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,120
you might not find out until that
job or apartment is all but gone.

376
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,000
You know who you'll have lost it
to, don't you ? Neil Patrick Harris.

377
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,120
You wouldn't think he could take
a certified public accountant job,

378
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,440
but he can
and he does it so well !

379
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,160
And he's so likable while
he does it ! He is so good.

380
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,800
To be fair here,

381
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,640
some companies will sell you
your own report.

382
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:17,600
So we had some of our staffers
buy their own background checks.

383
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,600
While most of them
came back fine,

384
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,920
five of our staffers' reports included
alias names they'd never heard of.

385
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,440
Charles Wilson
was mistaken for a man

386
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,200
who was indicted
for Medicaid fraud in Florida.

387
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,440
That site did say Charles's listing
was "pending verification".

388
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,320
And it was later removed from his
report. But it was still too late,

389
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,880
because by that time, in a
"Spartacus"-style show of support,

390
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,280
our office had rallied around Charles
and committed Medicaid fraud.

391
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,760
Because we care about him.

392
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,320
Given the stakes here,

393
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,480
you would hope these companies
are being closely monitored.

394
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,000
As this FTC official admits, there is
an alarming amount they don't know.

395
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,600
Is there any kind of national
list of these companies ?

396
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,840
No.

397
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,120
So we don't know how many of
these companies are out there ?

398
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,280
No, that's one of the challenges.

399
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,520
Yeah, no shit
that's one of the challenges.

400
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,440
You can't lose track of how many
background check companies are,

401
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,000
the way that we've all lost track
of the number of Oreo flavors.

402
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,800
"Root beer float" ?
Are you fucking kidding me ?

403
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,440
You are sick, Oreo.
You're all sick.

404
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,720
This whole industry seems
uncomfortably complacent.

405
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,360
Remember that FTC study,

406
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,160
which showed that one in twenty
credit reports had serious errors ?

407
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,240
And industry trade group put out
a press release with the title:

408
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,480
"FTC report confirms
credit reports are accurate",

409
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,760
arguing that it showed "95 percent
of consumers are unaffected."

410
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,520
But when you are holding records
for more than 200 million individuals,

411
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,400
that five percent error rate
affects 10 million people.

412
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,280
They're basically saying:
"Great news !"

413
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,240
We only fucked up a group equivalent
to the population of Sweden !

414
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,600
We're the fucking greatest !

415
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,120
If we could make the industry know
the jeopardy they place people in...

416
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,560
Maybe we can. Because remember
the big three credit companies,

417
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,960
Equifax, Experian, and Transunion ?

418
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,880
We started three terrible companies

419
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,200
with names that are problematically
similar to theirs.

420
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,960
Specifically, Equifacks,
Experianne and TramsOnion.

421
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,560
What do those companies do ?
Great question.

422
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,440
If you visit equifacks.com,

423
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,760
you'll see they take shelter animals
to customers' homes,

424
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,040
where animals lick peanut
butter off people's genitals,

425
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,320
before being
returned to the shelter.

426
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,520
Equifacks is an awful company.
But don't worry, Equifax.

427
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,320
I can't imagine anyone
will mistake them for you.

428
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,440
If you go to Experianne.com, you'll
find a company that sends people

429
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,080
to whisper passages from
Mein Kampf into babies' ears,

430
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,440
with the permission of neither
the baby nor the parents.

431
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,680
Don't miss TramsOnion.com,

432
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,560
where you can buy
these delicious looking steaks

433
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,080
made from the flesh of dead
orcas who worked at Sea World.

434
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,880
It would clearly be a disaster
for the credit agencies

435
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,720
if they were mistaken
for any of these companies.

436
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,360
But don't worry. I'm sure that won't
happen 95 percent of the time.

437
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,240
Apparently, that's good enough !
That's our show.

438
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,040
Thank you so much for watching,
we'll see you next week. Good night !

439
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,880
LAST WEEK TONIGHT

440
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,760
END OF EPISODE 8,
SERIES III
