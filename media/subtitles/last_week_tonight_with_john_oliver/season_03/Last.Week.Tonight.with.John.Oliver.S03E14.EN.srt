00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,280
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,280
SEASON III
EPISODE 14

3
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:36,120
Welcome. I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

4
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,440
Let us dive right in this week,
with the 2016 election,

5
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,640
or, as it's increasingly known,
America's fucktastic cirque de dismay.

6
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,280
The big news this week
surrounded Donald Trump,

7
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,200
a punch line that is quickly
becoming a nightmare.

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,840
Like if you said:
"take my wife, please"

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,400
and then she was actually
kidnapped by ISIS.

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,920
This week revealed
a somewhat startling statistic.

11
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,080
A new report from "USA Today"
found Trump and his businesses

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,360
have been involved in at least
3 500 lawsuits over 3 decades.

13
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,400
3 500 lawsuits ! Unprecedented
for a presidential nominee.

14
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,760
If each lawsuit were the basis of
an episode of "Law & Order",

15
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,480
they could sustain
all 456 episodes of the original,

16
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,080
all 389 episodes
of "Law & Order: SVU",

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,640
all 195 episodes
of "Law & Order: Criminal Intent".

18
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,760
And all 22 episodes
of "Law & Order: LA",

19
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,080
as well as every episode
of "The Practice", "Ally McBeal",

20
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,600
"LA Law", "Boston Legal",
"Night Court", "The Good Wife",

21
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,880
"Matlock", "Jag",
"Perry Mason", "Judging Amy",

22
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,680
"Guardian," "Public Defender",
"Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law",

23
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,840
"Harry's Law", "Courthouse", "Suits",
"Family Law", "Sweet Justice",

24
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,280
1971's "The DA",
2004's "The DA", "Reasonable Doubts",

25
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,240
"Damages", "Shark",
"Defenders," "Paper Chase",

26
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,720
"Head Cases," "Judd for the Defense",
all three episodes of "First Years",

27
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,760
and at that point,
you're still missing one lawsuit,

28
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,840
but you've also basically run out
of television shows about lawyers.

29
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,600
Meaning Trump's lawsuits exceed
the limits of the fucking genre !

30
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,640
There have been new developments
with Trump-related litigation,

31
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,800
after he complained about a judge
presiding over two cases against him.

32
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,960
I have a judge who is a hater
of Donald Trump, a hater.

33
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,560
He's a hater.
His name is Gonzalo Curiel.

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,680
He is not doing the right thing.

35
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,320
The judge, who happens to be
Mexican, I think that's fine.

36
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,480
You think that's fine ? Great news,
people of Mexican descent,

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,600
Trump thinks it is fine for you to be
a human being on this planet.

38
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,160
The judge in question was born in
Indiana. But that's not the point.

39
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,960
It was the judge's Mexican heritage
that made him unfit to judge Trump.

40
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,360
You're invoking his race when talking
about whether he can do his job.

41
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,280
I'm building a wall. I'm trying
to keep business out of Mexico.

42
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,840
- Mexico's fine, there's nothing...
- But he's an American.

43
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,000
He's of Mexican heritage and proud
of it, as I am where I come from.

44
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,200
Wait:
where exactly are you from ?

45
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,760
Beause you look like you came out of
a clogged drain at the Wonka Factory.

46
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,200
I think that's great.
I think that's fine.

47
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,040
Think about what he's implying:

48
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,240
the judge is unfit to do his job,
because of his ethnic background.

49
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,080
This morning,
Trump took it a step further.

50
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,760
What if he was a Muslim ?

51
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,440
You've been tough on
Muslim immigration ban.

52
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,800
If it were Muslim, would you also feel
they wouldn't be treating you fairly ?

53
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,120
It's possible, yes.
That would be possible.

54
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,800
I would say that was the dictionary
definition of "bigotry",

55
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,640
except after this campaign,
definition of "bigotry" might become:

56
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,480
"see: Trump, comma Donald".

57
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,400
The judge he insulted

58
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,320
is overseeing cases involving
the controversial Trump University.

59
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,240
He ordered a cache of
documents to be released.

60
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,880
Which was exciting.
'Cause we looked into his university

61
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,400
when we did our piece
on Trump in February,

62
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,600
and it wound up on this very long
list of awful Donald Trump stories

63
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,280
that we didn't have time to delve
into, even in a 22-minute piece.

64
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,160
But, once we started reading
through these new documents,

65
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,000
we figured, let's take some
time to talk about it now.

66
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,360
Trump University is amazing. When it
opened, Trump made some big claims.

67
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,440
At Trump University, we teach success.
That's what it's all about.

68
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,000
Success.
It's going to happen to you.

69
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,320
If you don't learn from the people
we'll put forward,

70
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,800
and these are all people
hand picked by me,

71
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,840
then you're not going to make it
in the world of success.

72
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,000
"The world of success"...

73
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,360
It sounds like what Donald Trump
calls his bedroom.

74
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,520
"Welcome to the world of success."

75
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,600
"Enjoy a mint
and a nondisclosure agreement."

76
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,360
Trump University ran into
problems in several states,

77
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,240
starting with the name itself.

78
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,880
We started looking
at Trump University,

79
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,480
and discovered that it was
a classic bait and switch scheme,

80
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,880
starting with the fact
that it was not a university.

81
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,680
Holy shit. Trump University
wasn't even a university.

82
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,600
Which is enough to make you wonder,
what the fuck was in Trump steaks ?

83
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,480
God, it was possum, wasn't it ?
It was possum, you monsters !

84
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,000
The name was just the beginning.

85
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,760
Remember he had
handpicked instructors ?

86
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,880
According to his own depositions,
he did not select instructors,

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,440
and was unable to recall the names
of key faculty members.

88
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,440
It's probably good that
he didn't handpick them.

89
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,000
That would be dangerous.
Anything Trump's tiny fingers touch

90
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,720
turn into an ex-wife
or an abandoned casino.

91
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,320
And it doesn't stop there.

92
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,720
According to the testimony
by several former employees,

93
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,920
many instructors had no experience
buying or selling real estate.

94
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,880
One worked as a salesman for Lowe's,

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,960
and another had been
manager for Buffalo Wild Wings.

96
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,560
Or as I call it, B-dubs-dubs.

97
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,480
Even a former member
of Trump's own sales staff

98
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,000
testified that it was:
a "joke", a "facade",

99
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,800
and was
"just selling false hopes and lies".

100
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:51,520
Every university has sold some
of its students false hopes and lies.

101
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,000
It's just most of the time,
they call it a theater arts degree.

102
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:02,120
These new documents also include
several playbooks of sales tactics.

103
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,680
The room temperature was
to be "no more than 68 degrees".

104
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,760
Partly to keep students alert and
partly because Professor Wild Wings

105
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,440
doesn't want the ranch sauce
getting all gamy.

106
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,520
There are also instructions on how
to sell and upsell students

107
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,560
or, as the playbooks call them:
"buyers", on expensive courses,

108
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,000
with tips like: "if a client
is adamant about knowing the price,"

109
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,320
"simply say: 'our course range
from $29 to $35,000".

110
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,040
If prospects seemed wary, there
was advice for dealing with that.

111
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,520
"You must be very aggressive",
one passage from the playbook reads.

112
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,280
"If they complain about the price,
remind them that Trump is the best."

113
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,840
Laugh, but that is
the same technique

114
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,920
that Trump has been using to run for
president, and apparently it works.

115
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,200
These playbooks are rife
with sleazy salesmanship.

116
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,480
Employees were told to substitute
"thank you" with "congratulations",

117
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,640
so that the potential customer
ends up thanking you.

118
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,360
Which is pretty obnoxious.

119
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,080
If I started this show with:

120
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,920
"Welcome to Last Week Tonight,
congratulations on joining us",

121
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,240
you would quite rightly
turn it off.

122
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,880
You're thinking: what about people
who simply didn't have the money ?

123
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,840
Trump U didn't really
have a problem with that.

124
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,320
A set of playbooks for the sales team
coached them on how to market courses

125
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,320
even to single mothers
with three children who quote:

126
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,040
"may need money for food".

127
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,360
Money is never a reason for not
enrolling in Trump University,

128
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,240
if they believe in your product
they'll find money.

129
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,880
You're not doing any favor by letting
someone use lack of money as excuse.

130
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,800
"Lack of money is not an excuse" is not
what single parents need to hear,

131
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,760
it's what Trump needs to hear

132
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,880
when a fifth company of his
files for chapter 11 bankruptcy.

133
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,120
Some of the customers on the end of
that hard sell wound up feeling duped.

134
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,720
Like Carmen Mendez, who put
a $35,000 course on her credit cards

135
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,400
and was left disappointed.

136
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,080
I thought that I'm going
to be a millionaire,

137
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,400
because Donald Trump is a millionaire

138
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,040
and they were offering
a course for people to get rich.

139
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,400
This is the closest Mendez got
to Trump during the course.

140
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,640
A picture of her
with a picture of Donald Trump.

141
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,880
That's not a one-off,
'cause another former student said:

142
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,520
"We were told we would get to have
our pictures taken with Trump."

143
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,000
"It ended up being a cardboard
cutout of Mr. Trump."

144
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,120
Which is a perfect metaphor
for Trump University.

145
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,760
You're expecting the real thing,
but all you get is a tacky,

146
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,440
two-dimensional facade with
Donald Trump's face slapped on it.

147
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,160
But the most suspicious thing
is that the playbooks even include

148
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,800
instructions on what to do
if an attorney general shows up.

149
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,600
The answer is not "kick over a table
and get the fuck out of there !"

150
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,960
No, apparently
you contact April immediately.

151
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,720
And it also reminds you: you do
not have to show personal information

152
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,440
unless they have a warrant.

153
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,480
Which is suspicious advice
for a university employee.

154
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,920
I'm sure Harvard doesn't
tell its new professors:

155
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,840
"Welcome ! Here's a gun and a cyanide
capsule in case the fuzz show up."

156
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,800
"Don't let them take you alive !"

157
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,840
Donald Trump has broadly denied
the claims in the lawsuits.

158
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,520
His attorneys gathered statements
from satisfied customers.

159
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,520
To hear Trump tell it,
the school was very good value.

160
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,440
98% of the people that took the
courses, we have report cards.

161
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,720
They report carded on the course.
98% of the people,

162
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,640
98% approved the courses,
they thought they were terrific.

163
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,440
There is something instantly
fishy about 98 percent.

164
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,640
The only things that have that level
of approval

165
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,320
are dictators, Pixar movies
and Neapolitan ice cream.

166
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,400
Chocolate for the chocoholics,
vanilla for the borings

167
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,360
and strawberry for the perverts.

168
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,200
According to plaintiffs,
those numbers are so high

169
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,360
cause surveys were not anonymous,
and were filled out when participants

170
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,080
were still expecting to receive future
benefits from the program,

171
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,320
such as assistance or mentoring from
the instructor they were evaluating.

172
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,440
Listen to why one former student
gave it a good review he now regrets.

173
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,600
I really look at it like this.
Say you go to a nice restaurant.

174
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,240
Really expensive restaurant
and you eat this really gorgeous dinner

175
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,640
and the chef comes near the end,
asks you how you liked the meal

176
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,160
and you really loved it.

177
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:58,080
By the time you go home, you realize
you'd gotten food poisoning.

178
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,720
- What do you think about Trump U ?
- I felt like I had been poisoned.

179
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,840
I felt I was just duped
and poisoned and ripped off.

180
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,400
Worse than that is having
that same feeling and then realizing:

181
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,200
"Shit, he's got 3 years,
364 days left in his first term."

182
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,880
But perhaps the most valuable lesson
to come out of Trump University

183
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,040
is the one it is giving us in what's
behind Trump's campaign strategy.

184
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,400
The playbook tells
his sales people:

185
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,800
"you don't sell products, benefits
or solutions, you sell feelings."

186
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,680
That is what is happening now.
Crowds at a Trump rally

187
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,480
may not be able to point to a concrete
benefit or solution he offers,

188
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,680
but they know
how he makes them feel,

189
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,320
and that is jacked-up and ready to boo
any name that sounds vaguely Latino.

190
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,040
If you plan
to vote for Trump in November,

191
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,280
I'd like to direct you to a quote from
Trump University's old homepage.

192
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,800
"Take the risk, but before you do,
learn what you're getting into."

193
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,520
Donald, I could not have said
it better myself, so thank you.

194
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,000
Or should I say, congratulations.
And now, this.

195
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,560
And now,
Wolf Blitzer states the obvious.

196
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,920
We'll hear from the president,
cameras will be in there, obviously.

197
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,400
He's got Ebola, obviously
a source of great concern.

198
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,920
A solution, obviously, that prevents
Iran from developing a nuclear bomb.

199
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,640
An 18-point lead for Clinton
in South Carolina,

200
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,640
obviously that's welcome
news for her campaign.

201
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,400
Kills about a third of those
who get this virus,

202
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,880
and that's obviously
very terrifying.

203
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,720
Bringing in Nazis and Hitler
obviously, not appropriate.

204
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,040
If anyone sees them, obviously,
don't get near them.

205
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,480
Romney obviously is a Mormon.
Obviously a lot of media there.

206
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,400
Obviously we have a gas mask.

207
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,880
Moving on. Our main topic
tonight concerns debt.

208
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,200
It's the reason Nicolas Cage made so
many great choices in recent years.

209
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,240
Presumably, it's the fuel he uses
to power performances

210
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,000
like this one, from his
recent movie "The Trust".

211
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,880
Open it !

212
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,920
Open it !

213
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,280
He delivered that line like a child
on PCP opening birthday presents,

214
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,120
which he clearly hopes
are full of more PCP.

215
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,600
American households collectively
owe over $12 trillion in debt.

216
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,480
And right now, $436 billion
of that debt is seriously delinquent,

217
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,080
meaning it's 90 or more days
past due.

218
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,200
And it is not good
when anything is that late.

219
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,320
If your baby were
three months overdue,

220
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,840
you'd effectively just be
giving birth to a floppy toddler.

221
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,560
If you have debts,
you should pay them if you can.

222
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,400
Many people find themselves in debt
for no direct fault of their own.

223
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,640
Take Bob Weinkauf, a few years ago,
he was in intensive care,

224
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,320
and after four days,
the hospital told his wife

225
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,920
the insurance was not
going to cover the costs.

226
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,880
She said:
"the bill is up to $80,000 already"

227
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,880
and she said: "Mrs. Weinkauf,
you're responsible for this bill".

228
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,240
I was hysterical.
I thought: what am I going to do ?

229
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,720
I've worked my whole life.
Is this how my life is gonna end ?

230
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,280
That's terrible. Because some
debts are completely unavoidable.

231
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,160
This isn't someone spending
$80,000 on this Versace coat

232
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,040
that looks like a banana
fucked a Rorschach test.

233
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,400
No, this is someone
spending $80,000 to breathe.

234
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,880
But the fact that so many people
have money trouble is not surprising.

235
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,440
What may surprise you
is the extent to which

236
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,480
seriously delinquent debts have given
birth to a debt-buying industry.

237
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,960
When consumers get a call: "I'm
calling on your Bank of America debt",

238
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,840
you assume that it's someone
at Bank of America.

239
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,720
Bank of America sold off that debt
for pennies on the dollar years ago

240
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,080
and it's been bought and sold.

241
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,560
Most of the big banks do it
and not just banks but payday loans,

242
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,040
book club membership,
gym fees, auto loans,

243
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,720
every year billions of dollars
of this debt is sold off cheap.

244
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,520
Debt-buying companies like these,
that you've probably never heard of,

245
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,280
have amassed a huge
amount of Americans' debt.

246
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,400
The largest, Encore Capital Group,
which has these subsidiaries,

247
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,120
tell investors that 1 in 5 consumers
either owes them money now

248
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,240
or has owed them money in the past.

249
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,120
Incredible.
That means, statistically,

250
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,680
one member of Evanescence
owes or has owed Encore money.

251
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,400
I think
we all know who that would be,

252
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,800
it would be guitarist and backing
vocalist Troy McLawhorn.

253
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,560
But, but as you will see,

254
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,040
almost every step of how this industry
is allowed to operate is problematic.

255
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,920
Let's start at the beginning.

256
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,760
Let's say you have a $1000 credit card
debt that you can't pay.

257
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:09,360
Your bank might write off
the full $1000 on its taxes

258
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:16,040
and then sell it off to a debt buyer
for a fraction of the cost, maybe $50.

259
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,080
That debt buyer can then come after
you for the full original amount.

260
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,520
And if it can't collect,
it can then re-sell that debt

261
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,560
to someone else, who can still come
after you for the original amount,

262
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,320
or sell it for a fraction of what
it paid, and so on.

263
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,960
You might think the information
changing hands would include

264
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,040
a lot of verifiable information,
but you would be wrong.

265
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,520
When I talk about debt that's
being bought and sold here,

266
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,360
we're talking about
an Excel spreadsheet.

267
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,200
The spreadsheet will have debtor's
name, social security number,

268
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,360
address, balance, one or two other
fields, but that's basically about it.

269
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,160
The information about your debt may
be sold in an Excel spreadsheet,

270
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,480
which is troubling for two reasons,
first, nothing good happens in Excel.

271
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,160
Most of us go into a cold sweat
if we just open it by accident.

272
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,600
God ! Please, no !

273
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,600
Let me go back in time
and fix this ! No !

274
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,600
And second: in many states,
there is little obligation

275
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,480
on the part of the debt seller
to provide additional documentation.

276
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,960
Many leaked contracts have stated
the debts are being sold "as-is"

277
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,680
and "with all faults".

278
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,560
Which are weird terms to see
in a major business transaction.

279
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,360
They'd even be troubling in
the context of an OK-Cupid profile.

280
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,880
"As is", "With all faults", "Sometimes
I masturbate to 'The Little Mermaid'."

281
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,640
"It's the fish half
that does it for me."

282
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,800
Debt buyers
aren't always scrupulous

283
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,880
about checking their information
before collecting.

284
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,240
Which is why it is not surprising
to see incidents like this:

285
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,000
I opened the door and
an envelope was thrown at me,

286
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,160
the guy said:
"you've been served".

287
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,480
It was a debt that I owed,
right under $5,000,

288
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,640
it was with a company
I never had a card with.

289
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:20,720
It's humiliating, intimidating,
it provokes a lot of anxiety.

290
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,720
"Humiliating, intimidating
and provokes anxiety."

291
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,120
I've had a similar experience,

292
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,040
but at least afterwards I got to brag
that I finally lost my virginity.

293
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,920
It was some years after that.

294
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,840
It's not just being sued
for a debt you don't recognize,

295
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,560
buyers can harass you over debt
past the statute of limitations,

296
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,440
or that you've discharged through
bankruptcy, or that you've paid.

297
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,160
You may've seen stories like this
on news, it's got a fun name.

298
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,280
It's called zombie debt.
That's debt that you thought was dead

299
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,360
but starts to take on a whole new
life much like a zombie.

300
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,440
Buried old debt coming back to life.
It's called zombie debt.

301
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,560
Not the kind of zombies that terrorize
humans on The Walking Dead.

302
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,400
Old debt, thought to be settled and
buried, coming out of the grave,

303
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,680
if not to eat your brain,
then to give you a headache.

304
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,040
Yeah, zombies are fun. But the
comparison is actually quite apt.

305
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,240
'Cause just like on The Walking Dead,
zombie debt comes back from the grave,

306
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,400
is hard to deal with, and seems to
disproportionately impact minorities.

307
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,120
Once a company bought your debt,

308
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,680
whether the information
is accurate or not,

309
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,880
they are going to try
to collect on it.

310
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,840
They can either do that themselves
or assign it to a collection agency.

311
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,000
Many collectors work within the bounds
of the law, some behave like this:

312
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,560
James, give me my money back.
I want my money or else I'll kill you.

313
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,920
If you refuse to answer
the door to me, I guarantee you,

314
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,800
I will wake up every neighbor
in your entire building.

315
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,680
You're just a loser. Why don't you
just go jump in front of a train ?

316
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,360
You wanna be a man ? Or you wanna
hide like a little bitty mouse ?

317
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,000
We're gonna have your dog arrested,
we're gonna shoot him up.

318
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,200
That is not just horrifying,
it's stupid.

319
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,400
How are you going to put handcuffs
on a dog ? They don't have wrists !

320
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,880
The cuffs are going to slip
straight off their doggie paws.

321
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,200
Your plan is silly.

322
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,040
Some debt collectors
won't just stop at calling you.

323
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,080
Listen to an employee
of a New York debt buyer

324
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,800
explain one of his tactics
to a hidden camera.

325
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,120
One of the things that I like to do,
which is pretty nasty, though,

326
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,640
is that I'll find out where
somebody works

327
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,800
and I'll find out who
the owner of the company is,

328
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,920
find out their number
and call them at home.

329
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,280
Call the boss at home.
My favorite thing.

330
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,000
That's your favorite thing ?
That is the weirdest favorite thing,

331
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,640
and I am including
"whiskers on kittens"

332
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,400
and "brown paper packages
tied up with string".

333
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,840
That's a parcel bomb.
She's describing a parcel bomb.

334
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,800
What's wrong with the rest
of the kitten, you creep ?

335
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,400
Tactics like the ones that
man described are illegal.

336
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,040
Debt buyers have been caught
operating in disregard for the law.

337
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,640
Look at Williams Scott & Associates.
Federal prosecutors allege

338
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,480
they lied to debtors,
telling them they were part

339
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,240
of a "government task force
set up to investigate fraud".

340
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,320
Using this letterhead, featuring
a clip-art image of scales

341
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,760
and the logo of, for some reason,
the State Department.

342
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,040
And they even gave
their employees aliases,

343
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,480
like "Senior Investorgator Ace Rogers"
and "Joe Steele".

344
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,000
Which sound like the stage names
of understudy Chippendales.

345
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,040
"Sorry, Ace. Sorry, Joe.
Everyone's here again tonight."

346
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,360
"Please put your shirts on
and leave."

347
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,800
The debt-buying industry will tell
you that all these abuses are outliers

348
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,440
and that most debt buyers
work within the law.

349
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,400
One way they do that is that
they sue people a lot.

350
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,920
They are among the heaviest individual
users of our state court systems.

351
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,360
In some cities like
Newark, St. Louis and Chicago,

352
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,080
debt buyers filed more cases
than any other type of plaintiff.

353
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:33,040
If you're wondering how the lawyers
have time to review all those cases,

354
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,440
they often don't.

355
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,240
When one New Jersey collection
firm was sued,

356
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,960
they found that one attorney reviewed
up to a thousand cases a day,

357
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,840
reviewing one case
for just four seconds.

358
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,400
There are things that you can
review in under four seconds.

359
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,080
Lays biscuits and gravy flavored
potato chips, for instance:

360
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,840
"One, two, three awful".
There you go.

361
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,240
Or your mother's new boyfriend.
One Mississippi... not my real dad !

362
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,040
But judging whether you have
enough information to sue someone

363
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,440
should take a little longer
than that.

364
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,920
There is a strategy
behind filing so many lawsuits.

365
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,680
These companies bank on
consumers ignoring the lawsuits,

366
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,440
which means they're automatically
responsible for the debt.

367
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,000
They're dealing with 90 to 95%
of these lawsuits going unanswered.

368
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:30,040
They go unanswered, meaning people
don't turn up to their court dates

369
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,120
and the debt buyers win by default.

370
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,640
And the phrase "by default" makes
any situation sound less legitimate.

371
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,600
"Hi, meet Carson.
He's my boyfriend, by default."

372
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,040
"Hi, Carson.
I have a lot of questions, then."

373
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,720
If they win, in many states,

374
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,240
they then have the power
to garnish your wages directly.

375
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,920
And given all of this,
it is hardly surprising

376
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,360
the debt collection industry
can claim a dubious honor.

377
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,440
We receive more complaints about
this industry than any other,

378
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,760
and last year, consumers filed
over 280 000 complaints

379
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,880
with federal authorities
related to debt collection.

380
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,880
There aren't even 280 000
complaints on the Yelp page

381
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,320
for Hitler's bunker.

382
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,720
I'd actually like to add one more:

383
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,560
"Why is there a Yelp page for this ?
One star for you."

384
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,440
Regulators and prosecutors have taken
successful actions against big players.

385
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,480
States tightened their laws
concerning debt buyers.

386
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,040
But others, like these,
have all loosened regulation.

387
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:45,600
In Arkansas, in 2013, representative
John Vines proposed HB 2028,

388
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,000
which he claimed
didn't do much at all.

389
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,400
It defines the term credit card,
which apparently has not been defined

390
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,120
throughout our many UCC provisions.

391
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,440
So all this does
is define credit card

392
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,400
and other terms

393
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,800
that are germane to credit card
and credit card usage, 2028.

394
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,520
I know that sounds like
the world's most boring man,

395
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,560
describing the world's
most boring bill boringly,

396
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,840
but that's not all it did.

397
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,880
That bill defined the legal term
"creditor" to include debt buyers,

398
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,720
and established a "presumption
of correctness" of the information

399
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,400
in favor of the debt buyer.

400
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,080
A friendly deal for them,
or anyone, like a bank,

401
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,960
that would want to sell to them.

402
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,800
Representative Vines' wife
works for a bank.

403
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,560
He should've disclosed that,
but there was really no need to,

404
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,800
because the legislature was too
busy joking about it.

405
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,080
And is this considered
a pro-consumer bill,

406
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,000
or neutral,
or helpful for banking ?

407
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,520
I don't know it's going to have
any effect on the consumer.

408
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,560
It clarifies the term of usage
presently used in the industry.

409
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,880
If it's not good for banking,

410
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,480
I suggest that representative Vines
not go home tonight.

411
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,680
I want to make sure he's taking
care of the bankers.

412
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,200
Always.

413
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,160
Always.
If I don't take care of the bankers,

414
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,720
I'm gonna be takin' care of myself
in the shower the rest of the week !

415
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,760
Five, give me five, I'll take another
five, let's make it a twenty.

416
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,960
That bill passed the Arkansas
house, 83 to zero.

417
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,920
But perhaps what's most concerning
is that in some states,

418
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,720
there is a shockingly low
barrier of entry into this industry.

419
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,520
You can purchase debt
with no license.

420
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,520
And in these states, you can
collect on debt with no license.

421
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,120
There are places in this country where
you need to fill out less paperwork

422
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,880
to start collecting money
from people's pockets

423
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,520
than you do to collect
fish from a fucking lake.

424
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,240
The debt buyers' trade group,
DBA international,

425
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,200
claims the industry is working
to regulate itself.

426
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,800
It's developed a code of ethics it
calls "the gold standard".

427
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,720
It has an annual conference in Vegas,
which does make sense,

428
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,720
as Vegas is the "gold standard"
of shitty places.

429
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,680
Anyone can go to their conference,
though I wouldn't recommend it.

430
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,720
It's bleak. I know that because
we sent people with a hidden camera.

431
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,920
The footage they brought back
was fascinating.

432
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,480
Not fascinating like a good book.

433
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,800
More like a rat carrying a wedding
ring across some train tracks.

434
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,640
There's a story there.
And it's a fucking sad one.

435
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,360
From the start of the conference,
there was a defensive tone.

436
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,520
One seminar was titled:

437
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,400
"Debt Buyers Are The Good Guys:
How To Convince The Court".

438
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,480
Although their argument
for that seemed shaky.

439
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,320
What we're doing,
unbeknownst to most of the world,

440
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,360
is we're helping the economy.

441
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,440
We're securing moneys from sources
that wouldn't have been paying them.

442
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:18,240
We're helping people to restructure
debt and get their lives in order.

443
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,360
They're really helping
people get their ducks in a row,

444
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,560
but only in the "window
of a Chinese restaurant" sense.

445
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,640
This "good guy" conference featured
a free shoeshine booth

446
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,000
for a business promising to "liquidate
your bankrupt and deceased debt".

447
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,480
Which is what it sounds like,
their business includes

448
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,800
"collecting on a debt after
the debtor passes away".

449
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,000
That is the sleaziest way
of making money imaginable,

450
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,040
other than a petting zoo attendant
charging ten bucks extra

451
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,360
to let you get to second base
with a goat.

452
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,880
Whenever the law did come up,
speakers could be surprisingly glib.

453
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,560
Some debt buyers try to collect
on out-of-statute debt,

454
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,960
which is debt that has grown so old,
you can no longer be sued over it.

455
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:13,360
Something that some states require
debt buyers notify you about.

456
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,840
Watch the contempt with which one
speaker dismisses those warnings.

457
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,840
Who's going to read and understand
these words on this letter ?

458
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,400
The unsophisticated consumer ?
I don't know.

459
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,200
Is it really going
to impact your collections ?

460
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,840
Put all the disclaimers
you want on the letter

461
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,520
has it really make
an impact on collections ?

462
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,800
I am sure no one wants to raise
their hand but I know it doesn't.

463
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,240
I deposed these plaintiffs
and they don't even read the letter.

464
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,000
Fuck you.

465
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,480
No good guy business model
has ever been based on the logic of:

466
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,680
"Don't worry about
people's rights."

467
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:57,440
"I'm sure half these unsophisticated
morons can't read. Right, guys ?"

468
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,160
"Am I right, though, guys ?"

469
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,800
Debt buying is a grimy business,
and badly needs more oversight.

470
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,920
Because as it stands,
any idiot can get into it.

471
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,000
I can prove that to you.
Because I'm an idiot.

472
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,840
We started a debt buying company.
And it was disturbingly easy.

473
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,160
Let me explain. Back in April,
we spent $50

474
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,040
to incorporate a debt-acquisition
company online in Mississippi.

475
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,000
Over the internet is the best way
to experience Mississippi.

476
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,240
We called it "Central Asset Recovery
Professionals" or "CARP",

477
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,120
after the bottom feeding fish.

478
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,520
I became chairman of the board.
And CARP set up this bland website

479
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,960
and dipped our toes
into the debt market.

480
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,680
And with little more
to go on than that website,

481
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:53,080
we were offered a portfolio
of nearly 15 million dollars

482
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,600
of out of statute medical debt
from Texas

483
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,360
at a cost of less than half a cent
on the dollar.

484
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,360
Which is less than 60 grand.
For that amount,

485
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,520
CARP would be sent the information
including names,

486
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,040
current addresses and social security
numbers of nearly 9 000 people.

487
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,280
So we bought it.
Which is absolutely terrifying.

488
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,000
If I wanted to, I could legally have
CARP take possession of that list

489
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,440
and have employees
start calling people,

490
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,800
turning their lives upside down over
debt they no longer had to pay.

491
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,800
There would be absolutely
nothing wrong with that,

492
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,600
except for the fact that absolutely
everything is wrong with that.

493
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,200
And that is why we decided
to go another way:

494
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,800
instead of collecting on the money,
why not forgive it ?

495
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,760
On one hand it's obviously
the right thing to do.

496
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:49,600
We'd be staging the largest one-time
giveaway in television-show history.

497
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:56,400
The most anyone has ever given
away on a TV show was this:

498
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,760
You get a car !

499
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,240
My goodness !
Everybody gets a car !

500
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,800
Yes !

501
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,840
That giveaway
was worth nearly $8 million.

502
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,160
But we bought nearly
twice that in medical debt.

503
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,560
Instead of having
the file sent to CARP,

504
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,200
we had the seller send it directly
to a non-profit organization,

505
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,400
which specializes in forgiving debt
with no consequences for the debtor.

506
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:38,000
Tonight, at my signal, with the power
vested in me as chairman of CARP,

507
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,960
they will commence
the debt forgiving process.

508
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,440
So, what do you say ? Are you
ready to make television history ?

509
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,640
Let's do this !

510
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:53,000
This is only going to help the 9 000
people whose medical debt we bought.

511
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,880
The larger issue is,
we need much clearer rules

512
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:03,120
to protect consumers from
predatory companies like ours.

513
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,840
In the meantime,
it seems the least we can do,

514
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,840
with this debt that I cannot
believe we are allowed to own,

515
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,360
is to give it away.

516
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,960
Are you ready to do this ?

517
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,600
You are about to watch me
give away $15 million.

518
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,280
Fuck you, Oprah.

519
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,800
It's done !

520
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,280
I am the new queen
of daytime talk !

521
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,640
Thank you so much
for watching the show !

522
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,280
Thank you
to the debt-buying industry

523
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,360
and our irreparable
problems associated !

524
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,640
See you next week,
good night !

525
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,480
