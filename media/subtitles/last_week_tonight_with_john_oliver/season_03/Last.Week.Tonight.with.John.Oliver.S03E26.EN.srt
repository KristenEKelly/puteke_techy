00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,320
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,440
SEASON III, EPISODE 26

3
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,560
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,000
Thank you so much for joining us !

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,080
Let us dive straight in
with the 2016 election,

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,360
or as you may know it,
"I don't even believe in past lives,"

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,040
"but I must have done something
fucking terrible to deserve this"

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,800
"I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry 2016".

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,160
This week has yet again been
dominated by Donald Trump.

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,040
WikiLeaks continues to release emails
connected to the Clinton campaign

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,600
that raise serious issues,
from that campaign's behavior,

12
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,920
to the fact the hack may have
come from the Russian government...

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,280
But it is hard
to focus on any of that

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,800
when the man
who could be our next president

15
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,360
is now one unearthed '90s-era
Teen People interview away

16
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,840
from being
on a sex-offender registry.

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,560
Because Trump
has had quite the week.

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,600
The Republican presidential candidate
facing accusations from multiple women

19
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,040
who say Trump touched them,
kissed them against their will.

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,680
The first time it was a quick hug
and a kiss on the lips.

21
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,360
I was shocked. I have never
had anybody greet me like that.

22
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,720
I said maybe that's how the people
on the East Coast greet each other.

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,760
Okay. First, that is horrible.

24
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,320
But, for the record, that is not how
we on the East Coast greet each other.

25
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,240
The way we greet each other
is very simple: we don't do it.

26
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,760
We stare at the ground and hope
the other person moves away quickly,

27
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,000
so we can go back to muttering under
our breath without seeming crazy.

28
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,240
This has been a week of upsetting
allegations regarding Trump,

29
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,960
I'm not going to make you sit
through them again.

30
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,240
All you really need
to know about the man

31
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,200
is that this was his response
to one of his accusers.

32
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,680
Believe me, she would not be
my first choice, that I can tell you.

33
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,560
Man !

34
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,480
That would not be my first choice.

35
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,000
Two weeks ago, I told you that if you
looked up, you could see rock bottom.

36
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,520
Then, last week,
I told you that if you looked up,

37
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,000
you could see
the place we were a week ago.

38
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,520
This week, if you look up,
all you can see are the thin,

39
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,080
plywood boards
surrounding us on all sides.

40
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,720
Because we are in a coffin,

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,120
and we are buried alive
in the horror that is this election.

42
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,000
But incredibly, Trump's remarks were
in keeping with the tone he promised.

43
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,520
The Republican nominee proclaiming
on Twitter he is a free man, quote:

44
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,640
"It's so nice that the shackles
have been taken off me"

45
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,480
"and I can now fight for America
the way I want to".

46
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,600
Yes, the shackles are off.
Which is actually an apt metaphor,

47
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,720
as it calls to mind both
Frankenstein's monster and a rabid dog.

48
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,080
And before I start to run through
what Trump has said this week,

49
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,560
keep in mind,
we tape this show at 6 p.m.

50
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,440
So here is a rundown of some of the
things he feasibly could have said

51
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,800
between now
and the point when we air:

52
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,080
all those clowns people keep seeing
would be appointed to his cabinet.

53
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,600
He can get the best deals with China
because he is in fact 100% Chinese.

54
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,320
Border wall is going to be constructed
out of Rosie O'Donnell's bones.

55
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,320
Abortions are caused
by low energy storks.

56
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,360
And finally, it's not rape
if it happens on a yacht.

57
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,560
But here is what he has said
as of now:

58
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,280
he burned bridges with his own party,
calling Paul Ryan weak, ineffective,

59
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,160
and then at campaign rallies,

60
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,400
dialed the knob up
to full-on conspiracy theorist.

61
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,160
Hillary Clinton meets in secret
with international banks

62
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,560
to plot the destruction
of US sovereignty.

63
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,200
This is a conspiracy against you,
the American people,

64
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,520
and we can not let this happen
or continue.

65
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,680
Holy shit.

66
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,720
That is not the kind of thing
that a presidential candidate says.

67
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,440
It's the thing
that a man in a tin foil hat

68
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,400
screams inside his concrete bunker
because he thinks his soup cans

69
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,720
have been bugged by the lizard people
in the White House.

70
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,680
But Trump isn't just rampaging
against his political opponents.

71
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,240
He's rampaging
against his own campaign.

72
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,960
When one journalist tweeted

73
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,280
that a Trump supporter was standing in
the back shouting "Stay on the issues",

74
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,520
his own campaign manager,
Kellyanne Conway, responded:

75
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,440
"That was me. I was there".

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,680
And even if she meant that as a joke,
it's not a great indication

77
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,720
of how much control
she has over her candidate.

78
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,320
It's like she's already thinking
ahead to her campaign tell-all book,

79
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,200
or possibly her tell-all trial
at The Hague.

80
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,200
But perhaps most ominously of all,

81
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,920
Trump took a theme that he's been
dancing around all this campaign

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,840
and made it explicitly
and frighteningly direct.

83
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,880
The election is rigged. It's rigged
like you've never seen before.

84
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,680
You see what's happening,
the process is rigged.

85
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,760
This whole election
is being rigged.

86
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,240
Telling your supporters the election is
being rigged is legitimately dangerous.

87
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,240
Because faith in fair elections
and a peaceful transfer of power

88
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,800
are essential foundations
for a democracy

89
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,680
and undermining them is like asking
why one of those giant eagles

90
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,600
didn't just fly Frodo all the way
to Mordor in "The Lord of the Rings".

91
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,760
If enough people start thinking
that way, the whole thing falls apart.

92
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,440
A quick side note:
please address your long rebuttals

93
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,440
about why the Fellowship of the Ring
did not go with that plan

94
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,800
to "John Oliver at just kidding
dot go fuck yourself".

95
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,720
So, just to recap:

96
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,440
this week, Trump has declared
war on his political opponents,

97
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,320
the media, his own party,
his own campaign,

98
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,720
and the concept of democracy itself.

99
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,240
A man who is increasingly
positioning himself

100
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,200
as the only source of truth
and goodness in America.

101
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,880
I never knew it would be this vile,

102
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,000
that it would be this bad,
that it would be this vicious.

103
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,680
Nevertheless, I take all of these
slings and arrows gladly for you.

104
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,080
And many political experts

105
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,720
warned me that this campaign
would be a journey to hell.

106
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,080
Said that. But they're wrong.
It will be a journey to heaven.

107
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,840
You heard right: he sees himself
as a lone, persecuted savior

108
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,000
who started out in construction,
is suffering on behalf of his followers,

109
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,840
and will take them to heaven.

110
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,680
We have known that Trump believes
he's the second coming of Christ,

111
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,360
but it turns out
he might mean that literally.

112
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,360
The only difference being, with Christ,
we think "what would Jesus do ?"

113
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,600
and with Trump, it's more, "Jesus,
what the fuck did you just do ?"

114
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,360
And now this !

115
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,040
And now, the most patient man
on television, 2016 election edition.

116
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,480
I wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton
if she gave me a million dollars.

117
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Now as far as Zika is concerned
I think maybe we could get a pill

118
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,560
that would make a smelly smell
come right on our skin

119
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,480
that would make the Zika...
mosquitos disappear.

120
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,680
Ted Cruz has this
"make America great again" on his cap.

121
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,560
That's the Donald Trump line,
"make America great again".

122
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,000
That's Donald Trump.

123
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,360
Trump, telling everybody
to raise their right hand,

124
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,680
kind of reminded me of Hitler.

125
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,880
Does he want to have
another third world war ?

126
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,240
I am sick about the way Hillary,

127
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,840
this pandered to all the black folks
in South Carolina...

128
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,520
It was black this, black that,
got to go save the blacks.

129
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,840
- When did she become secretary ?
-  Hillary Clinton ?

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,600
- Yeah, is she still secretary ?
- No.

131
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,600
- You lived in that country ?
- I certainly do.

132
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,920
Right there, in a den of liars,
right there, where you're at.

133
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,400
Bob, thank you.

134
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,640
- The weirdness of this, is ridiculous.
- Jesse, thank you.

135
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,040
The media is on the Democratic side.

136
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,480
- I'd like to ask you one thing.
- Sure.

137
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,360
- Have you heard of Cassius Clay ?
- Of course.

138
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,400
Yeah and then, Luol Sender,
what a cool name !

139
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:11,040
- Why did they change their names ?
- That's another topic, for another day.

140
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,920
Moving on. Our main story tonight

141
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,280
is, unfortunately, continuing
coverage of the 2016 election.

142
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,040
Or as it's better known, lice on rats
on a horse corpse on fire 2016.

143
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,240
This election has achieved
a dubious distinction:

144
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,200
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump

145
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,960
are among the most disliked
presidential candidates in history.

146
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,520
So some are seeking
an alternative.

147
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,400
- Who's your vote for ?
- I don't like either candidate.

148
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,800
I'm not excited about the election,
I don't like either options.

149
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,320
They're kinda bumming me out.

150
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,600
315, 320 million people and this is
the best 2 that we can come up with ?

151
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,400
Americans are so disillusioned
by the major party candidates,

152
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,000
it seems many would prefer
to vote for Kevin Kline's character

153
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,320
from the movie "Dave"
or the ghost of Martin Luther King Jr.

154
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,800
assuming he only said the
three quotes that white people like.

155
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,560
And this disenchantment

156
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,400
may explain the high interest
in America's third parties.

157
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,800
When your two main options
are depressing,

158
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,120
any third choice seems good.

159
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,800
If you're in,
if you're at a KFC-Taco Bell

160
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,560
and you see a bunch of pigeons
eating something in the parking lot,

161
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,040
you might well think "hang on,
what have they got over there ?"

162
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,440
And, luckily, there are a great
many third party options out there.

163
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,520
Jim Hedges, Prohibition Party,

164
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,720
the worst party without alcohol since
your born-again cousin's wedding.

165
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,760
Dan Vacek of the Legal Marijuana
Now Party, which should be called

166
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,640
the "Illegal Marijuana Now,
Legal Marijuana ASAP" party.

167
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,840
And then there's independent
write-in candidate Joe Exotic,

168
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,360
who claims to run the world's
largest private zoo for tigers,

169
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,280
and produces
incredible campaign videos.

170
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,680
First thing is,
I am not cutting my hair.

171
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,160
I'm not changing the way I dress.
I refuse to wear a suit.

172
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,160
I am gay. I've had two boyfriends
most of my life.

173
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,800
I am broke as shit,

174
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,560
I have a judgment against me
from some bitch in Florida.

175
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,160
This is all paid for by the committee
of Joe Exotic Speaks for America.

176
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,280
Joe Exotic is truly the candidate

177
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,720
you'd want to sit
down and have a beer with.

178
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,400
Then another beer.
And then several more beers

179
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,600
until you're drunk enough
to try meth for the first time.

180
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,720
The point is, Joe Exotic:
make America Exotic Again.

181
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,360
But the best-known
of the lesser-known candidates

182
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,600
are clearly Libertarian Gary Johnson
and Green Party nominee Jill Stein.

183
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,720
In a poll last month,
more than a third of young voters

184
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,520
said they are considering
voting for one of them.

185
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,840
They are worth taking seriously.
Before we go any further,

186
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,080
we should address
the common critique

187
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,960
that third party candidates
can siphon off votes,

188
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,360
and potentially wind up
electing an ideological opponent.

189
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,960
There is some precedent,
from Teddy Roosevelt's 1912 run,

190
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,240
which arguably helped to elect
Democrat Woodrow Wilson,

191
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,920
to Ralph Nader in 2000, winning
nearly 100 000 votes in Florida,

192
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,600
a state which Al Gore
famously lost by just 537.

193
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,520
But third parties are a little touchy
about that whole spoiler tag.

194
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,360
Watch Gary Johnson
respond after it's brought up !

195
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,520
What do you guys make of the idea
that you are a spoiler candidate?

196
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,320
That it's just... It's horrible.
Why would you even say that ?

197
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,240
We are giving people
a chance to vote for something

198
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,600
as opposed
to the lesser of two evils.

199
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,520
We're not spoilers,
we are the first vote.

200
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,680
So I guess we should drop out ?
Is that what you're saying ?

201
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,320
Gary, just relax a little bit.

202
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,680
You've undercut your credentials
as a serious candidate

203
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,760
by wearing a yellow tie with jeans.

204
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,200
Gary, you're running for president,
not officiating Pikachu's beach wedding.

205
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,520
Although Johnson's anger
is understandable.

206
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,560
Dismissing third-party candidates
as "spoilers" shuts down debate.

207
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,400
The argument that the only thing
that stops Trump

208
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,080
is a vote for Hillary Clinton,
is a powerful one,

209
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,400
so is the one that people should vote
the candidate who shares their values.

210
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,680
So let's vet these candidates
not as spoilers, or as protest votes,

211
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,160
but as legitimate
potential presidents.

212
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,800
And we'll start with Jill Stein,
the candidate who looks most

213
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,880
like she believes carob is
"just as good as chocolate".

214
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,920
Stein is polling around two percent,
and she has a lot going for her.

215
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,400
She's a doctor who practiced
internal medicine for 27 years,

216
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,680
and she has a broadly
appealing pitch,

217
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,920
from environmental issues
to expanding LGBT rights,

218
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,880
to reducing income inequality.

219
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,560
But when it comes to policy,
we know the devil is in the details.

220
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,600
So how exactly is she going
to accomplish her goals ?

221
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,640
And let's start with the plan that
has been central to her candidacy.

222
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,920
We're the one party that's actually
calling for canceling student debt

223
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,040
and bailing out
a generation of young people

224
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,120
like we bailed out
the bankers on Wall Street.

225
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,560
We can do that for this generation,
and unleash them

226
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,680
to be the stimulus
package of our dreams.

227
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,280
Okay, hold on, because
"stimulus package of your dreams"

228
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,200
sounds like how Paul Krugman
describes his penis.

229
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,680
But she is right. Student debt
is a massive, $1.3 trillion problem.

230
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,680
Canceling
it is Stein's flagship proposal.

231
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,640
It is to her campaign what the
border wall is to Donald Trump's.

232
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,560
So you would assume that she has
a well-thought-out, coherent plan.

233
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,360
My campaign is the only one
that will do for young people

234
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,920
what our misleaders saw fit to do
for Wall Street not that long ago.

235
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,600
It was about $4 trillion
in free money,

236
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,480
in the form of so-called quantitative
easing, which is a magic trick

237
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,840
that people don't need to understand
more about in that it is a magic trick.

238
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,120
No, it isn't though. It is a very
complicated monetary policy tool.

239
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,160
It might not be important
for people to understand it,

240
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,200
you have to
and I don't think you do.

241
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,240
While Jill Stein has said:
"president has authority to cancel"

242
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,280
"student debt using quantitative
easing", that is absolutely wrong.

243
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,600
The president does not have authority,
only the Federal Reserve does.

244
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,120
It does not take orders
from the White House,

245
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
because
that would be dangerous.

246
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,960
You don't want to give presidents
the power to just create new money.

247
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,960
Think of it like this,
if Joe Exotic is elected,

248
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,520
you don't want him to be able
to order the Fed to create money

249
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,080
for the most lavish tiger-themed
orgy the nation ever seen.

250
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,520
Because they would then have to print
the $3500 it would take to do that.

251
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,160
So that issue makes her plan
a non-starter,

252
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,640
before we even get into the fact that
quantitative easing doesn't apply here.

253
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,480
Stein's implying it was
used to cancel banks' debts

254
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,320
and that is not what it did.

255
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,000
Using it that way
amounts to a president

256
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,440
passing a new law and funding it
by printing new money.

257
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,840
The dangers of that should be
pretty obvious.

258
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,080
In terms of how fundamentally
how flawed that is,

259
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,440
it's akin to saying:
"I'll make us energy independent"

260
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,240
"by ordering the post
office to invade Canada."

261
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,280
No, Jill, that's impractical and you
don't seem to understand it.

262
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,160
When I said her proposal

263
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,480
was her version of Donald Trump's
border wall, I meant it.

264
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,200
The only way it could be
any more unlikely

265
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,360
is if she claimed Mexico
was somehow going to pay for it.

266
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,840
For a candidate who seems
to be running on principle,

267
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,080
it can be hard to pin her
down on what those principles are.

268
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,880
After the Brexit, her campaign
issued a statement

269
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,960
in which she called the decision
a victory, changing it:

270
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,360
"I agreed with the UK Greens
who supported staying in the EU."

271
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,320
In response to charges
she was anti-vaccination,

272
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,760
she tweeted: "no evidence
that autism is caused by vaccines",

273
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:11,200
before Jill Stein, a doctor,
replaced it with a more equivocal:

274
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,640
"I'm not aware of evidence
linking autism with vaccines."

275
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,680
Leaving the door open for doubt.
And... fucking measles.

276
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,560
This vagueness applies to answering
a question from a 9/11 truther.

277
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,560
I believe that the hijackers were
patsies. They did have intent,

278
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,200
but there was no ways they could
fly those planes the way they did,

279
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,320
and there's no way those steel
buildings could fall...

280
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,120
- An opinion about that ?
- We need the full story.

281
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,560
The 9/11 commission itself said
we don't have the full story.

282
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,560
I would bring back that commission.
This isn't controversial.

283
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,320
It's time to get the full story.

284
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:58,400
What are you doing ? You know that
man thinks you agreed with him now ?

285
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,160
You can't just hear a conspiracy
theory, fan the flames,

286
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,800
and then walk away:
"Is Katy Perry Jon Benet Ramsey ?"

287
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,360
Identity theft is a real and persistent
issue in this day and age,

288
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,400
and we need to look into that.

289
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,040
And if none of what I have said
bothers you, that's fine.

290
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,320
It's not really fine.
But that is your right.

291
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,120
But you are also going to need to
cosign on one more awkward thing

292
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,240
and that is that Jill Stein recorded
several albums

293
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,760
as part of a '90s folk rock
band called "Somebody's Sister".

294
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,160
And you don't get to not hear
what they sound like.

295
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,880
She wonders what
will happen to the babies

296
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,520
When all the mothers' milk
has gone bad.

297
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,680
From the poison pouring
from the smokestacks,

298
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,560
Risin' up like silent thunder
from the ash.

299
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,000
Jill, that is a very bad song.

300
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,400
Silent thunder is nothing.
You're describing silence.

301
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,560
I cannot have a president who's going
to play her own inauguration

302
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,680
with a band that sounds like
the Indigo Girls fronting RHCP.

303
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,680
Let's move on to Gary Johnson,
the two-term governor of New Mexico

304
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,400
and who, in most photographs,
seems to be around 80% sure

305
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,160
he is running for president.

306
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,080
He's been polling around six percent
nationally, which is remarkable,

307
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,720
given that his race has been notable
for not knowing what Aleppo is,

308
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,760
not being able to name
a world leader he admires

309
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,840
and whatever it is
he's doing here.

310
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,200
If you were to get on the debate stage
you could pull even ?

311
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:56,000
I could stand there the whole debate,
not say anything and emerge as leader.

312
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,600
I'm not sure if he was doing
that with his tongue on purpose,

313
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,320
or if Gary Johnson's tongue
just decided:

314
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,640
"Fuck it, I'm done" and tried
to escape through his mouth.

315
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,440
There is obviously more to
Gary Johnson than just mistakes.

316
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,920
He's an avid outdoorsman, who
loves mountain climbing so much,

317
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,080
he once described summiting
Mount Everest like this.

318
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,120
People ask me what was it like
to conquer Mount Everest ?

319
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,080
I did not conquer
Mount Everest.

320
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,400
She lifted her skirt, I got in there,
got a peek, and it was really cool.

321
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,840
Okay, I'm still
a little confused here.

322
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,520
Did you actually
climb Mount Everest

323
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,120
or did you just dry hump
the side of it and then go home ?

324
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,600
It was great. Now smell my finger.
There's still some mountain air on it.

325
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,560
What is wrong with you ?

326
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,720
His policies, as with Jill Stein,
there is a lot to like there.

327
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,440
He supports marijuana legalization,
opposes the death penalty,

328
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,120
civil forfeiture
and police militarization.

329
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,080
There are some positions you
may be less comfortable with.

330
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,400
He opposes minimum wage

331
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,040
and when he says he's for smaller
government, he's not kidding.

332
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,160
Could you name 3 federal departments
or agencies that you would eliminate ?

333
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,160
Education, Department of Commerce
and Housing and Urban Development.

334
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,720
How's that for starters ?

335
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,600
He's giving up
government agencies left and right.

336
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,000
This is Sophie's Choice
if she hated all of her children.

337
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,160
"Take both kids ! I'm sick of
stepping on Legos ! Off you go."

338
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,120
That is an intellectually
consistent position.

339
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,480
Watch him fold
under the slightest pressure.

340
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,920
Would any of their functions still be
performed by the federal government ?

341
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,560
Gosh. You'd have to assume
that they were doing something

342
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,320
that was of value and if they
are doing something of value,

343
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,960
we would be looking
to continue those operations.

344
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,600
All do a lot of stuff. You can't
identify any specific things they do ?

345
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,760
You're asking three departments
and I'm giving them to you.

346
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,120
Let's take the assumption
they should be eliminated.

347
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:26,360
For the record, those three departments
do actually do things of value.

348
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,960
Assuming you find Pell Grants,
low-income housing programs,

349
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,520
the patent and trademark office and
the census bureau to be of some value.

350
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,680
If it's news to you
that's what those departments do,

351
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,800
then: "Hi Gary ! I'm excited
you're watching the show !"

352
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,600
"Quick advice, please stop
trying to fuck mountains !"

353
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:51,640
Again, like Jill Stein, Johnson
is prone to overly-simple solutions

354
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,400
that could have
disastrous consequences.

355
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,040
Look how he applies his small
government approach to tax policy.

356
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,480
If I could wave a magic wand,
I would eliminate income tax.

357
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,880
I would eliminate corporate tax.
I would abolish the IRS.

358
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,240
I would replace it all with one
federal consumption tax.

359
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:16,880
You have a magic wand and first thing
you'd do is eliminate income tax ?

360
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,680
Shame on you.
The first thing anyone should do

361
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,120
is make soap taste
as good as it smells.

362
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,400
Fuck you. Don't judge me, it's not the
"only" thing that I would do.

363
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,520
It's just the first thing
I would do.

364
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,800
But that magical, simple plan
gets complicated fast.

365
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,880
Johnson says his consumption tax

366
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,000
would be between 23 and 28 percent
on everything you buy.

367
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,680
That could clearly hurt
poor people the most.

368
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,720
His answer is that every single home
would receive a "prebate" check,

369
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,320
covering the cost of the sales tax
up to around the poverty line.

370
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,280
But when a presidential advisory
panel studied a similar proposal,

371
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,760
they found that
it's not just that simple.

372
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,640
Aside from the complexity of
the prebate program,

373
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,440
which would become America's
largest entitlement program ever,

374
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:09,040
they suggested the sales tax
would have to be more than 28 percent,

375
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,120
with the burden
falling heavily on the middle class.

376
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,040
To avoid that there might
have to be government cuts.

377
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,560
Rather than admit that, Johnson
tries to wriggle out of the subject.

378
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:25,320
You wind up cutting the amount of
revenues the government work with.

379
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:32,320
- It's revenue neutral....
- That's not so easy to achieve.

380
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,240
- Well then, well maybe not
- Just to give you the context, why ?

381
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,880
If you say the fair tax number
that's usually thrown out is 28%.

382
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,760
So you're reducing the 39% from
the top level down.

383
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,040
That creates an issue about how you
want to distribute the tax burden.

384
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,960
- You're getting too into weeds.
- You think so ?

385
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,400
What do you mean,
too in the weeds ?

386
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:01,160
The only point of discussing
tax policy is to get into the weeds.

387
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,640
That, and preventing premature
ejaculation. That's the two options.

388
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:12,000
And if it can seem like Johnson
doesn't give a fuck, maybe he doesn't.

389
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,560
Wait until you hear his stance
on combating climate change.

390
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,320
Should we take the long-term view
when it comes to global warming ?

391
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,960
I think that we should.
And the long-term view

392
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,680
is that in billions of years
the sun is going actually to grow

393
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:30,120
and encompass the earth,
global warming is in our future.

394
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,600
That's your plan ? "Don't worry,
we'll all be dead anyway" ?

395
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,840
We're lucky we won't be around
to see that day,

396
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,640
because I do not want the last thing
I hear to be Gary Johnson saying:

397
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,200
"the sun's not so
much conquered the Earth,"

398
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,400
"it's merely lifted up her skirt
and fingerblasted it."

399
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,080
"No Gary,
why are you so weird ?"

400
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,880
The more you look
at Gary Johnson and Jill Stein,

401
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,280
you realize the lack of coverage
they complain about so much

402
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,120
might have benefited them.

403
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,600
Their key proposals begin to crumble
under the slightest scrutiny.

404
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,680
I would love for there to be
a perfect third party candidate.

405
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,920
A third party candidate can put
a new issue or solution on the table.

406
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,360
But it is hard to make the case
that is what's happening here.

407
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,200
There is no perfect candidate.
And when people say:

408
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,920
"you don't have to choose the lesser
of two evils," they are right:

409
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,560
because you have
to choose the lesser of four.

410
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,800
Anyone who goes into a voting booth
and comes out saying:

411
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,000
"I feel 100 percent great
about what I just did in there"

412
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,480
is either lying or did something
unspeakable in that booth.

413
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:49,000
And that means everyone has to
own the flaws of whoever you vote for

414
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,400
whether they are a lying, handsy,
narcissistic sociopath,

415
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,120
a Wall Street-friendly embodiment of
what people can't stand about politics,

416
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:02,520
an ill-tempered mountain-molester
with a radical, dangerous tax plan

417
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,480
or a political neophyte with no
understanding of how government works,

418
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,320
and who once recorded this folk-rap
about the virtues of bicycling.

419
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,800
She's up there in the sun
and underneath the stars

420
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,560
To get there in these cars

421
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,400
Biking for the nation
The future generation,

422
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,480
You think it's transportation,
to her it's a salvation.

423
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,920
I feel like we figured out who
or what killed Biggie and Tupac.

424
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,720
And before you say:
"Hold on John,"

425
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,560
"there is one candidate
you haven't mentioned",

426
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,320
I remind you: he's broke as shit
and he will not wear a suit.

427
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,360
And now this.

428
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,120
A glimpse into the inner workings of
the most patient man on television.

429
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,440
Steve joining us from Haymarket,
Virginia. Republican line.

430
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:58,040
Yes. About three years ago, a man
named Liang-Shi Fan developed

431
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:03,280
a process where you can
burn virtually any carbon fuel

432
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,680
without producing any CO2.

433
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:13,120
Allan Savory uses holistic grazing
to re-sequester CO2 in the ground.

434
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,720
If you go to Prince William County,
Hellwig Park and Ben Lomond Park,

435
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,640
I built about
20 constructive wetlands.

436
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,240
We can build
constructive wetlands,

437
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,520
but we're limited to that space
between the North and the South Pole.

438
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,240
So we really don't have
any environmental problems,

439
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,440
what we have is a bunch
of politicians

440
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:44,200
who wanna take $1.5 trillion out
of the economy every year

441
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:51,640
for these windmills up on Mount Storm,
West Virginia, you can look at them.

442
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,120
It takes about
two hours to get up there.

443
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,240
10% of them are locked up.
Then you have to take a crane

444
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,840
that runs on diesel fuel,
take the windmill...

445
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,720
Time to go back, now.

446
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,560
... who can repair
big devices like that.

447
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,040
So you have to take to Mexico, fix 'em,
bring 'em back up with a truck again

448
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,120
and put them up on them poles.

449
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,200
So we really do not have
any green alternative

450
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:28,920
to the mirrors in Las Vegas
burst into flames here recently.

451
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:33,480
They haven't quite figured out
that the Earth rotates,

452
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,400
you don't have
to move mirrors.

453
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,320
Thank you for the call.

454
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,840
That's our show, thank you.
See you next week, goodnight !

455
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,160
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

456
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,640
END OF EPISODE 26,
SEASON III
