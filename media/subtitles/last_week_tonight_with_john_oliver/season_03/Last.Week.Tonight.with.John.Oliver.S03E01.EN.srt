1
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,360
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to Last Week Tonight.

2
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,400
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

3
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,960
We are back, we are back.

4
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,320
And look, listen, listen, listen,
let me be honest right from the start:

5
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,200
we had prepared to start this show
with a fun recap

6
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,600
of everything that we've missed
in the past three months,

7
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,440
from the Iowa caucus
and the New Hampshire primary,

8
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,680
to this fucking asshole,

9
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,640
to Kanye denying that he enjoys
the presence of fingers in his butt.

10
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,320
It's been a busy three months
we've missed.

11
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,960
But then last night,

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,480
that all pretty much went out
the window, when this happened:

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,480
This is CNN Breaking News.

14
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,760
I have some very sad breaking news
just in to us here at CNN.

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,560
United States Supreme Court Justice
has died.

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,320
First: that is a rare case of CNN's
dramatic "Breaking News" banner

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,320
actually being justified. Because
normally it's reserved for

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,240
informing us that a man named Wolf
is going into a tunnel,

19
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,560
or that a major news event occurred
over a century ago.

20
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,480
And look, let's be honest:

21
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,520
there are a lot of strong feelings
surrounding Antonin Scalia,

22
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,200
but his death is the end of an era
on the Supreme Court.

23
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,640
He was a hugely significant justice,

24
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,720
and for the purposes of our Supreme
Court, an absolutely adorable bulldog.

25
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,800
So, obviously this is a very sad day
for his family and his friends.

26
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,200
And it's also a tough day for us here
at the show,

27
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,960
partly because I now have to murder
that dog.

28
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,400
You knew the deal, Pickles.
You signed the contract.

29
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,280
The fact is,

30
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,000
there is now a huge vacancy on the
Supreme Court that needs to be filled.

31
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,280
Or if you've listened to
the republicans in the past 24 hours,

32
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,360
not.

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,080
In an unprecedented move,

34
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,200
senator Mitch McConnell immediately
released a statement saying

35
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,560
this vacancy should not be
filled until we have a new president.

36
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,400
We're not going to give up the U.S.
Supreme Court for a generation

37
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,040
by allowing Barack Obama
to make one more liberal appointee.

38
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,320
I think it's up to Mitch McConnell,
and everybody else to stop it.

39
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,280
It's called delay, delay, delay.

40
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,000
Well, that does not bode well.

41
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,360
Because Mitch McConnell is pretty
good at delaying things for people,

42
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,760
whether it's legislation,
court appointments, or orgasms.

43
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,600
Believe me, if you ever need to
delay, delay, delay,

44
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,120
just picture that face, and I guarantee
you, nothing will happen.

45
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,440
Possibly for the rest of your life.

46
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,320
Now interestingly, a strange,
unwritten rule of the senate

47
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,680
is being cited
to justify this behavior.

48
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,760
There is an informal rule in the
Senate, called the Thurmond rule.

49
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,440
The rule that Strom Thurmond
put forward was,

50
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,080
no president in the last six months
of their presidency

51
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,960
should be able to appoint a judge
that has a lifetime appointment.

52
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,840
Yes, "the Strom Thurmond rule".
I'm not surprised there is one,

53
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,440
it's just I thought it would
always be about

54
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,200
the amount of hush-money required to
keep your secret family a secret.

55
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,040
Or how racist an old person can be
before their age is not an excuse.

56
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,080
But if Mitch McConnell does want to
evoke this rule,

57
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,360
he will need to be careful, because
during the George W. Bush years,

58
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,360
when democrats were trying to pull
this Thurmond Rule bullshit

59
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,480
to prevent lower-court appointments,
he was pretty categorical about it.

60
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,360
Our democratic colleagues continually
talk about the so-called Thurmond Rule,

61
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,760
under which the senate stops confirming
judges in a presidential election year.

62
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,920
This seeming obsession with this rule
that doesn't exist

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,080
is an excuse for our colleagues to run
out the clock on qualified nominees

64
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,760
who are waiting to fill
badly needed vacancies.

65
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,760
Yes, it seems the Thurmond Rule is
a bit like God.

66
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,800
When things are going your way,
you don't bring it up a lot,

67
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,920
but as soon as you're in trouble,
it is all that you talk about.

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,760
And it's also worth noting that
the Thurmond rule generally applies

69
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,400
to the last six months
of a president's term,

70
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,000
so even if it does apply, it wouldn't
come into effect until July 20th.

71
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,240
Although, what more fitting tribute to
the life and work of Antonin Scalia

72
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,040
than the senate really trying to
stretch the definition of "late term" ?

73
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:54,040
And also: it's weird to see a debate
over an unwritten rule,

74
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,080
when you consider what Antonin Scalia
stood for.

75
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,960
He's someone who always defended the
original meaning of the constitution,

76
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,120
who understood that the constitution
was not there to be interpreted

77
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,880
based on the fads of the moment,

78
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,120
but it was there to be interpreted
according to its original meaning.

79
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,400
He's right.
Scalia loved the letter of the law.

80
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,600
So let's look at the letter that
applies here, shall we ?

81
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,520
Article 2, section 2 of the
Constitution says the president,

82
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,200
"shall nominate, and by and with
the advice and consent of the senate,

83
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,120
shall appoint judges
of the supreme court."

84
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,920
That's the president, this president.

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,360
There is nothing in the constitution
about you delaying him for a year

86
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,400
because of some bullshit tradition.

87
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,720
So to senate republicans I say this,
if you really loved Antonin Scalia,

88
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,720
you wouldn't honor his memory by
desecrating the thing he loved most.

89
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,840
Think of Scalia like a Brita filter
or a child's hamster.

90
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,360
Why don't you honor his entire reason
for being

91
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,440
by swiftly and efficiently
replacing him ?

92
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,960
I am sure we'll be covering a lot of
this Supreme Court fight in the future,

93
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:05,480
but for now, let's turn to another
major American institution: Chipotle.

94
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,760
America's preferred over-the-counter
laxative.

95
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,520
It has been a rough few months for the

96
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,200
sure-let's-go-ahead-and-call-it-
Mexican fast food chain.

97
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,400
Since last July, they've experienced
six food safety failures

98
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,080
involving Norovirus, Salmonella,
and E. coli.

99
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,360
And as of December, they face a federal
criminal investigation as well.

100
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,040
So on Monday,
they took drastic action.

101
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Chipotle temporarily closed all 2,000
of its stores for four hours today

102
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,000
to hold a scheduled a company-wide
employee meeting

103
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,680
on the topic of food safety.

104
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,160
Closed stores ? Well, that is bad news
for Chipotle. But on the bright side,

105
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,640
it's the best day Subway has had
since Jared went to prison. But...

106
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,680
But I will say:

107
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,560
it may take more than a few hours

108
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,400
to fix some of the systemic problems
Chipotle has with its restaurants,

109
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,080
especially when you consider reports
like this from a station in Florida:

110
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,760
In January, inspectors walked into
Chipotle

111
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,080
on Cortez Road
west in Bradenton,

112
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,840
and saw a live, wild bird flying
around the restaurant,

113
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,640
with open food at the front line
exposed to possible contamination.

114
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,800
According to the inspection
report, the manager says

115
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,600
he was aware of that wild bird
and it's a regular nuisance.

116
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,160
"Oh yeah, I know that bird. He bought
a soda like a year ago

117
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,680
and he just keeps filling it up. That
bird's a dick ! You're a dick, Keith !

118
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,360
You're a dick !"

119
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,360
But I am sure,

120
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,840
I am absolutely sure that the manager
of that bird infested Chipotle

121
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,640
made sure that it could never ever
happen again.

122
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,720
Animal control was called to remove
the bird,

123
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,160
but when inspectors returned
the next day:

124
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,440
live bird, still there.

125
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,640
What ? "Live bird, still there"

126
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,120
is the second-lowest grade you can
get from a health inspection.

127
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,200
The lowest one, of course,
being a Fieri.

128
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,760
But to go by customers' reactions to
Chipotle store closings on Monday,

129
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,240
they may not have too much
to worry about.

130
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,600
I'm disappointed. I understand they
need to take like safety precautions,

131
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,840
but I love Chipotle.

132
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,360
- Will it deter you from eating there ?
- No.

133
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,160
- Love those burrito bowls too much ?
- Yeah, exactly.

134
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,080
It's just so good, it's just so tasty.
It's my dirty little secret.

135
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,080
I love Chipotle.

136
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,720
So hold on. They know it's bad,
and they want it even more.

137
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,080
Chipotle is now officially America's
emotionally abusive boyfriend.

138
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,720
It seems Chipotle have us in the palm
of their hands.

139
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,440
And judging from their latest
commercial, they know it.

140
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,800
Listen, we know that here at Chipotle
we've had a bad few months.

141
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,840
Not only did we make people sick with
E. Coli, Norovirus and Salmonella,

142
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,480
we're also under criminal investigation
by the federal government.

143
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,000
But don't worry, we took a full
half-day off on Monday to regroup,

144
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,480
and now we're ready to welcome you back
with open arms !

145
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,120
Welcome to Chipotle !
Thank you for your bravery.

146
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,400
Sure, Chipotle's hit rock bottom.

147
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,400
But all that means is that we're ready
to bounce back.

148
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,920
If you're even contemplating eating
here after an E. Coli scare,

149
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,480
what would it take to stop you ?

150
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,840
Learning the one time we accidentally
put penguin meat in our barbacoa ?

151
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,360
Or the three months ago
we couldn't find the lettuce,

152
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,800
so we just used that Easter basket
grass for, like, five full days ?

153
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,960
Or we thaw our meat by having a large
man named Mitchell breathe on it ?

154
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,600
Or that there are a number of wild
birds that come in and eat for free,

155
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:46,200
who, in our defense, are only there to
deal with our massive vole problem.

156
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,680
Or that our head chef is an actual
six-foot cockroach.

157
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,960
I'm still pretty sure you'd come back.
And you know why ?

158
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,280
If Chipotle could persuade America
1,000-calorie burritos are healthy

159
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,560
and we actually did that,

160
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,480
well, then we can do anything we damn
well please.

161
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,720
Chipotle. What are you gonna do,
go to Taco Bell ?

162
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,160
I don't think so !

163
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,280
Moving on...

164
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,960
We are finally
in an election year,

165
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,800
so for our main story tonight,
let's look at voting.

166
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,960
The cornerstone of American democracy,

167
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,840
the unshakable principle that everyone
should have an equal vote.

168
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,840
Even idiots.
Even this guy.

169
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,200
Go !

170
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,200
I know it's painful, but his vote
should count as much as yours.

171
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,200
It should count as much as
the president's.

172
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,640
That's what America is all about.

173
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,560
Now in recent years, some states
have made voting easier.

174
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,280
For instance, three states hold their
elections almost entirely by mail.

175
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,240
And thirty states plus D.C.
now let you register to vote online.

176
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,080
Sadly, others have gone
in the opposite direction.

177
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,640
Because depending on who you are
and where you live,

178
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,920
you may face new obstacles to voting
this November, thanks to,

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
among other things,

180
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,200
the Supreme Court's decision
to weaken the Voting Rights Act.

181
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:15,040
For instance, since 2011, seven states
have curtailed early voting.

182
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,320
13 have added requirements that voters
show some kind of ID at the polls.

183
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,960
And the lawmakers pushing
those voter ID laws claim

184
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,480
they are just simple,
commonsense measures.

185
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,840
It is common sense you would use
picture ID

186
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,200
to protect the integrity
of the voting process.

187
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,360
It's an ID. Everyone has an ID.
The people that are homeless,

188
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,240
the people that go to vote, they get
sick, they go to the hospital,

189
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,840
they buy stuff. They need IDs.

190
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,320
I'm proud that North Carolina has
joined the 34 other states

191
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,440
to enact a commonsense voter ID law
that

192
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,520
isn't going to impact a significant
amount of North Carolinians.

193
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,080
Will not impact a "significant" number
of North Carolinians ?

194
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,200
Well, that's fine. Although,
by that standard, you could also say

195
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,920
"we're going to incinerate everyone
named Warren."

196
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,280
That's not a
significant number of people,

197
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,680
but you are going to have a justifiably
upset Warren Beatty on your hands.

198
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,960
That law is significant to him.

199
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,000
Because not everyone does have ID.
In Texas alone,

200
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,920
at least half a million voters do not
have the form of ID necessary to vote,

201
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,960
North Carolina and Wisconsin
have roughly 300,000 voters apiece

202
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,480
with neither a driver's license
nor a state ID,

203
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,520
and in Virginia, an estimated 200,000
voters may not have one.

204
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
And if you think about it,

205
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,000
you probably know at least one person
who doesn't have an ID.

206
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,320
Whether it's your grandma
who had her license taken away,

207
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,520
your recluse uncle
who rollerblades everywhere,

208
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,280
or your cousin who lost his license
after his third D.U.I.

209
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
Come on, Jace.

210
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,080
You can't fool a breathalyzer by
whispering the word "sober" into it.

211
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,240
And even if you try to obtain an ID
just in order to vote,

212
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,800
it can be difficult. Listen to what
a Pennsylvania woman went through,

213
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,280
when her state's ID law was in effect.

214
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,480
Sixty-eight-year-old Doris Clark
was turned down three times

215
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,840
applying for her Pennsylvania
voter ID card.

216
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,400
And every time, she says, the state
wanted another document:

217
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,480
original birth certificate,
original social security card,

218
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,000
then she needed
her husband's death certificate

219
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,760
when a clerk demanded proof
of her married name.

220
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,480
You feel like, why am I going through
all these things ?

221
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,280
I am not Bin Laden's wife.

222
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,320
Bin Laden's wife ?
That is a strange way to frame it.

223
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,480
Why not say Osama bin Laden was
"Amal al-Sadah's husband" ?

224
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,360
Or "Siham Sabar's husband" ?
Or "Khairiah Sabar's" husband ?

225
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,280
Hashtag Osama bin Laden
hashtag feminism.

226
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,520
And yet, none of these difficulties
seemed to trouble legislators

227
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,360
like Wisconsin's Joel Kleefisch,
who argued for a strict ID law

228
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,080
by pointing out his state's photo ID
requirement to buy Sudafed.

229
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,440
I find it frustrating

230
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,080
that so many of
the same people who today

231
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,640
are telling us that a photo ID is just
too gosh darn much

232
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,560
to maintain the integrity of the ballot

233
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,080
and those same people
two sessions ago

234
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,480
made sure, those same people, many of
the same people in this room,

235
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,880
made sure two sessions ago

236
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,520
that you had to have a photo ID
to buy stuffy nose medicine.

237
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,600
Okay, couple of things there.

238
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,560
First, that bill was designed to
help curtail Wisconsin's meth problem.

239
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,560
And second, voting is a right, if you
take it away, you ruin democracy.

240
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,560
If you take away someone's Sudafed,
you'll only ruin is their sleeve.

241
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,720
And in some parts of the country,

242
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,800
the offices that issue IDs
are hardly ever open.

243
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,040
In 2012, a study found that in
Wisconsin, Alabama and Mississippi,

244
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,640
fewer than half of all ID issuing
offices are open five days a week.

245
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,200
And in Sauk City, Wisconsin,

246
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,840
just a few districts over from where
that business-casual Kevin Smith lives

247
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,600
the ID office is only open on the fifth
Wednesday of every month.

248
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,880
And only four months in 2016
even have five Wednesdays.

249
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,040
Oh, but don't worry ! There's a rhyme !

250
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,920
"March, June, August, November
have five Wednesdays

251
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,400
but remember,
if you come on days not those,

252
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,480
fuck yourself they're fucking closed !"

253
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,440
Every first grader in Wisconsin
gets taught that one.

254
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,920
We should also mention that studies
have shown these restrictions tend to

255
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,920
disproportionately impact
African American and Latino voters.

256
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,840
In Texas, for instance, experts found
that African American voters

257
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,920
were nearly twice as likely
to lack voter ID,

258
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,360
and Latinos were nearly
two and a half times as likely.

259
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,120
It's one of those things that white
people seem to be more likely to have,

260
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,280
like a sunburn,
or an Oscar nomination.

261
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,240
So why are we doing this ?

262
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,960
Well, if you listen to the legislators
who helped pass these laws,

263
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,640
they'll say that they are necessary
to prevent fraud.

264
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,040
Here's a co-sponsor of Texas's
voter ID law, Debbie Riddle:

265
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,440
The very freedom of our nation

266
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,560
is based
on the integrity of our ballot box.

267
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,800
And if things are so lax

268
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,960
that fraudulent voting can occur,

269
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,920
that means your vote can be stolen.

270
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,600
And simply showing an identification

271
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,560
is not too much to ask.

272
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,160
Are you sure about that, though ?

273
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,840
"Don't eat fish on the subway"
is not too much to ask.

274
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,680
Never start a Facebook status with
'that moment when'

275
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,120
is not too much to ask.

276
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,160
Requiring ID
can actually be asking a lot.

277
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,480
And as for the fraudulent elections,
well, let's look at that for a moment.

278
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,280
Because while American history is
littered with vote-buying,

279
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,280
vote-tampering,
and ballot-box stuffing,

280
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,280
voter ID
doesn't prevent those crimes.

281
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,960
The only crime it prevents
is voter impersonation:

282
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,960
one person, showing up to the polls,
pretending to be someone they're not.

283
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,880
Which is a pretty stupid crime.

284
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,840
'Cause you have to stand in line,
at a polling place,

285
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,360
and risk five years in prison
and a ten-thousand dollar fine,

286
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,560
all to cast one
probably not consequential extra vote.

287
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,800
In terms of pointless crimes,

288
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,120
it's right up there with forging
a Bed Bath and Beyond coupon.

289
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,080
It's a lot of trouble with low reward.

290
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,120
And yet people insist
that this happens a lot.

291
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,280
Without photo ID,
what do you fear could happen ?

292
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,120
Well, without photo ID, let's be clear:

293
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,680
I don't want dead people voting in
the state of South Carolina.

294
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,080
I've said that from the very beginning.

295
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,160
Authorities say there is evidence that
dead people voting is a real problem,

296
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,000
according to a statewide investigation

297
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,960
by South Carolina's department
of motor vehicles.

298
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:59,920
In January, it found that 953 ballots
were cast by voter who were deceased.

299
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,560
Now that's true, the DMV did say that.

300
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,600
And the study caused such a
stir that one lawmaker stated,

301
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:11,000
"We must have certainty in South
Carolina that zombies aren't voting."

302
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,920
And look, he's right:
no one wants that.

303
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,960
Except, possibly, for upstart candidate
Philip Braaaaaaaaaaaaiins.

304
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,200
But when the state's law enforcement
division investigated the DMV's claims,

305
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,360
it found no real basis for them.

306
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,920
In fact, of the prior election's
207 suspicious ballots,

307
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,960
92 of them were cases where someone had
the same name as a deceased voter,

308
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,520
usually a father and son.

309
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,640
56 of them were cases where the social
security number of a living voter

310
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,560
was mistakenly matched with a dead
person. 32 were simply scanner errors.

311
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,640
One person requested
an absentee ballot, completed it,

312
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,760
and then died while it was in the mail.

313
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,640
And most of the others were an array of
random clerical errors.

314
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,080
Altogether, the investigation found 5
ballots that couldn't be accounted for.

315
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,880
This in an election where more than
1.3 million votes were cast.

316
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,680
These voter ID laws are the biggest
over-reaction to a manageable problem

317
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,600
since Sleeping Beauty's father ordered

318
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,880
all the spinning wheels in the land
to be burned.

319
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,880
This is an agrarian economy,
we need those wheels !

320
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,240
Why don't you just watch your daughter
for literally one day in her life ?

321
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,040
One day ! One day !

322
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,720
The truth here is,

323
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,240
voter impersonation fraud
is incredibly rare.

324
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,480
One researcher who tracked it closely
found that, from 2000 to 2014,

325
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,040
there were 31 possible incidents
in the entire country,

326
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,800
out of over a billion ballots cast.

327
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,080
Voter fraud is a problem,

328
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,600
the way that deadly knife-play
from crabs is a problem.

329
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,440
I'm not saying it doesn't exist.
There are cases where it has happened.

330
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,600
But let's not overreact
to one stabby crab.

331
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,360
But these laws do actually tend to make
a little more sense

332
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,160
whenever you see someone slip up

333
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,880
and suggest other reasons
for why they may support them.

334
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,680
Voter ID, which is gonna allow Governor
Romney to win Pennsylvania, done !

335
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,200
You think the attention drawn to voter
ID affected last year's elections ?

336
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,280
Yeah, I think a little bit. I think
we probably had a better election.

337
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,400
Think about this:
we cut Obama by five percent.

338
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,800
Which was big, you know a lot of people
lost sight of that.

339
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,960
He won, he beat McCain by ten percent
and he beat Romney by five percent,

340
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,400
and I think that probably that photo ID
helped a bit in that.

341
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,680
Oh, no ! You're saying the thing that
everyone knows

342
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,480
but you're not supposed to
say out loud !

343
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:46,000
That's like writing, "I'm desperate to
bone" on an online dating profile.

344
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,480
Or a band calling their reunion tour
"We Ran Out Of Money".

345
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,960
But perhaps the most galling thing here

346
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:59,320
is that there are actual cases of voter
impersonation, caught on camera.

347
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,080
And you will never believe
where they happen.

348
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,160
This is state representative
Debbie Riddle.

349
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,480
She authored the bill that would
require voters to show a photo ID.

350
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,280
Clerk ring the bell,
it's a record vote.

351
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,320
It's all about integrity.

352
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,520
It's a record vote.

353
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,520
But the integrity of one person, one
vote, doesn't apply at the legislature.

354
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,520
We found many lawmakers
vote more than once.

355
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,960
Take a look: Riddle votes, turns around
and votes again for state rep Kemple.

356
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,800
Rewind, and watch the men
on the screen.

357
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,960
Elkins goes to vote for merit,
but Hancock is faster.

358
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,480
Elkins heads back to his desk,

359
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,880
but before he can vote, Joe Crabb
turns around and beats him to it.

360
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,960
Holy shit !

361
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,040
They are literally competing to press
other people's voting buttons !

362
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,880
And remember: this is Texas, which has
the strictest ID laws in the country !

363
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,840
And apparently, this process is called
"ghost voting",

364
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,160
and it happens in state legislatures
all over the country.

365
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,960
And sometimes they involve
literal ghost votes.

366
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,200
One lawmaker in Texas died,
and was recorded voting three times

367
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,120
later that day.
Which is clearly ridiculous.

368
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,760
A real ghost wouldn't waste its time
voting on bills.

369
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,600
It would be out terrorizing a young
family in their new house,

370
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,160
or trying desperately to bang Demi
Moore on a pottery wheel one last time.

371
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,840
And Debbie Riddle is not the only voter
ID proponent who has done this.

372
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,920
Remember Wisconsin's Joel Kleefisch ?

373
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,960
There is no way
that he got caught doing it, right ?

374
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,240
A cellphone video posted online

375
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,680
shows Kleefisch placing a vote
for an absent assembly member.

376
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,040
Kleefisch says the online video is an
attempt at character assassination.

377
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,600
No, no, no,
that's not character assassination:

378
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,480
it's unedited footage
of something you obviously did.

379
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,400
If anything, that is character
autoerotic asphyxiation.

380
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,520
And lawmakers in Tennessee
are so shameless about this,

381
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,440
they've got the whole thing down to
a fine art.

382
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,920
It's such a common practice
in the house in fact that

383
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,280
many lawmakers have sticks they use to
reach each others' voting buttons.

384
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,760
Look, if you are going to
pervert democracy,

385
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,760
could at least do it
with a less creepy stick ?

386
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,560
That looks like what an evil leprechaun
would use to beat a child.

387
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,760
And yet, whenever legislators like
Debbie Riddle

388
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,120
are asked about
this actual voter impersonation,

389
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,280
they say they've done nothing wrong,
and are only acting out of necessity.

390
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,240
We have a lot of votes,
we have a lot of amendments,

391
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,760
and there's times when we don't break
for lunch and for dinner.

392
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,760
We don't have bathroom breaks.

393
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,760
Okay, well, quick suggestion:

394
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,320
have you considered getting some
extra-long voting sticks ? They help.

395
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,760
You know what ? At this point, I would
like to propose something:

396
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,800
Any politician who has ever supported
an unnecessary voter ID law,

397
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,040
should be forced to obtain a new ID
every time they want to pass a bill.

398
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,480
Just to make sure they are
who they say they are.

399
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,080
And yes, they might say, "Well, John,
that's ridiculous.

400
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,600
There is no real reason to make us
do that. And it's so cumbersome,

401
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,640
it could prevent us from engaging in
the democratic process."

402
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,080
To which I would say, "Welcome to the
fucking club."

403
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,160
And now this.

404
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,080
And now, newscasters using entirely
the wrong tone.

405
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,280
- How are ya ?
- Good, great.

406
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,200
Nice to see you. We've got
some breaking news out of Egypt.

407
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,240
Parts of that country
are blowing up today.

408
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,760
Rain, rain go away, I think we're all
shouting that this morning.

409
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,080
I know it sounds cliché but the streets
are virtually rivers.

410
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,000
Coming up, 5 dead in Las Vegas.

411
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,880
Potholes in Minneapolis are sending
people to the hospital !

412
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,280
- It's great to see you all.
- Hey, thanks for having me.

413
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,160
Coming up, it's happened once again,
a high school student shot dead.

414
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,720
- Alright, Elaine, thank you.
- Sure.

415
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,680
No let up in the tug-of-war,
that's good Nora,

416
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,640
no let up in the tug-of-war
over a little boy with brain cancer.

417
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,640
North Carolina police arrested
a suspect

418
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,480
in the death of a pregnant Fort Bragg
soldier.

419
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,360
That's the first time a federal
appeals court has struck down

420
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,880
a state's ban
on same-sex marriage, is that right ?

421
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,520
You said it, Kristen.

422
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,280
And finally tonight, New Zealand:
Australia's chia pet.

423
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,640
We've talked a lot about New Zealand on
this show in the last couple of years.

424
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,000
From their ridiculous Prime Minister
John Key,

425
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:24,080
to the public competition to design
a new flag, featuring these entries.

426
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,680
We talked about them so much

427
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,200
we were going to have a moratorium on
discussing New Zealand on this show.

428
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,680
Until this happened.

429
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,200
Protests at Waitangi against
the transpacific partnership

430
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,480
reached climax today when economic
development minister Steven Joyce

431
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,760
was hit in the face with a sex toy.

432
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,920
Without the prime minister,
there was meant to be no drama.

433
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,800
But then... This.

434
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,600
Yes, that's what you think it is.
Steven Joyce hit with a sex toy.

435
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:58,080
Step aside, "Citizen Kane",
there is a new greatest film in town.

436
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,640
And listen, while the slow-motion
footage is undeniably funny,

437
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,160
it's not as funny as the natural sound
of it bouncing off his nose.

438
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,240
Take a listen:

439
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,240
We always take something away from
every meeting we have.

440
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,440
I think my favorite part of that is

441
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,000
his unruffled surprise
at being hit in the face with a dildo.

442
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,560
As if it either happens to him
all the time, or at the very least,

443
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,400
he anticipated it "would"
inevitably happen "someday."

444
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,960
And to New Zealand's credit,

445
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,840
the woman who threw that toy
was not charged with anything.

446
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,040
This is her face as she was led away.
She does not look sorry.

447
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,080
And if you threw something
at a politician in this country,

448
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,440
you'd be dead before the dildo
hit the ground.

449
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,480
Also, New Zealand's media has taken to
calling Steven Joyce "Dildo Baggins."

450
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:59,200
A play on words, which should be
awarded the Nobel Prize for literature.

451
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,800
And yet, we were still reluctant
to cover this story.

452
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,000
Until, incredibly, our hand was forced.

453
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,480
Even Mr. Joyce saw the funny side,
taking to Twitter

454
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,560
and jokingly encouraging someone
to send the footage

455
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,800
to American comedian John Oliver
so quote, "we can get it over with."

456
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,080
It's true ! This is his tweet.

457
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,600
And you know what, Steven Joyce ?

458
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,680
You're right, you're right.
This was inevitable, Steven Joyce.

459
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:34,240
As inevitable as a large, floppy rubber
cock smacking you in the face.

460
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,080
So let's, in your words,
"get this over with".

461
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,280
Although, I think we both know,
this will never be over for you.

462
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,080
Your entire life will now be viewed
through a dildonic prism.

463
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,280
For instance: this seemingly innocuous
tweet you sent last month

464
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,240
of vegetables from your garden ?

465
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,120
You want to know what people picture
when they see that now ?

466
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,320
Dildos, Joyce.
Freshly harvested dildos.

467
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,960
Also, let's all agree: New Zealand's
flag debate should now be over.

468
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,960
Because if you want an image that sums
up everything great about New Zealand,

469
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,480
this is the flag right here.

470
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:13,840
What Olympic team would not be proud to
march beneath that ?

471
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,880
And we didn't just mock that up,
New Zealand,

472
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,000
we got one made,
and sent it to your country,

473
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,960
and gave it to one of your greatest
sons, Peter Jackson.

474
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,560
And if you don't believe me,
watch this !

475
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,200
Hey, John ! This is Peter Jackson
down here in New Zealand.

476
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,120
What do you think
of the new dildo flag ?

477
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,840
What do you think, John ?
The people have spoken.

478
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,440
Once again,
New Zealand punches above its weight.

479
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,840
Indeed you have, New Zealand. But guess
what ? We're not even done yet.

480
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,240
Because if you're going to try
and bait me, Joyce, into a response,

481
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,480
prepare for the nuclear option.

482
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,960
I present to you a choir singing
about your dildo incident

483
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,520
to the tune of the hallelujah chorus !

484
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,280
It's a dildo, giant dildo,

485
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,080

a flying dildo.

486
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:17,120
Yes ? Is this what you wanted, Steven
Joyce ? Is this what you wanted ?

487
