LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,400
SEASON III
EPISODE 22

3
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,400
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !

4
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,440
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

5
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,360
Lots to get through this week,
let's quickly begin with the Olympics.

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,000
Home of sports
like "stupid tiny tennis",

7
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,880
"inconvenient frisbee",
and whatever the fuck this is.

8
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,520
These games have been
full of thrilling performances,

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,680
from Simone Biles to Usain Bolt

10
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,720
to the horse that danced around to
"Smooth" by Santana and Rob Thomas.

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,320
That just answered the question:
"how do you simultaneously"

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,760
"undermine the dignity of both
Carlos Santana and a horse ?"

13
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,560
There were also controversies,

14
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,640
from the presence of the Russian team
in the wake of their doping scandal

15
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,360
to an IOC official being arrested
for alleged ticket-scalping,

16
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,840
to the international saga
of Ryan Lochte,

17
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,280
a swimmer who looks
like he's about to play

18
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,160
the John Slattery role
in a porn parody of Mad Men.

19
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,520
Lochte made headlines this week

20
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,320
by claiming he and 3 other swimmers
had been robbed at gunpoint,

21
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,320
and then made headlines again
once witnesses,

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,400
backed up by security-cam footage
from a gas station,

23
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,880
revealed the swimmers had been
confronted by a security guard,

24
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,760
after they broke a soap dispenser
in the bathroom,

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,560
damaged a door, tore down a sign
and urinated around the premises.

26
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,160
And spare a thought there
for the soap dispenser.

27
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,320
"I was already a gas station's
men's room soap dispenser !"

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,440
"My life was shitty enough !"

29
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,800
"And now I'm being vandalized
by 'if Sting was a jock'" ?

30
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,440
And while his teammates
were detained by authorities,

31
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,560
Lochte, the purest form
of the chemical element Bro,

32
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,720
was already back in America,
offering a bullshit apology.

33
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,760
Lochte posting
on social media, quote:

34
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,680
"I want to apologize
for my behavior last weekend"

35
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,400
"and for not being more careful
in how I described the events".

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,120
There is no way he wrote that.
I am pretty sure that Ryan Lochte

37
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,480
thinks Game of Thrones
took place in the late 1800's

38
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,320
and still doesn't understand
how mirrors work.

39
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,680
"- Dude stop copying me !
- I'll stop when you stop, bro."

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,520
And look:
people are right to be angry here,

41
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,000
because Lochte's behavior
wasn't just shitty and entitled.

42
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,200
He's also ruined himself for us.
Four years ago,

43
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,080
he was America's favorite
sweet dumb merman,

44
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,640
who claimed to have designed his shoes
and described the process like this.

45
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,280
These are my shoes that I design
from the top to the very sole,

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,440
to the very top to the bottom...
you know... laces.

47
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,640
He couldn't remember
all the parts of a shoe,

48
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,440
and he was standing
next to hundreds of shoes !

49
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,360
The fact that Lochte is a total asshole
is not remotely surprising.

50
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,080
It's just that,
it makes him a lot less fun now.

51
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,440
So as we say goodbye
to the Rio Olympics,

52
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,720
sadly, we must also say farewell
to one of America's favorite idiots.

53
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,640
Ryan Lochte:
America's idiot sea cow.

54
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,880
What I was always good
at was letting things go through

55
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,400
like, through one ear
out the other so to say.

56
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,280
Douchebag. I don't even know.
What is a douchebag ? What is it ?

57
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,640
I always see babies and the clothes
that they wear and it's horrendous.

58
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,440
I just blanked out again.

59
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm an athelet...letic person.

60
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,080
Whether it's life or just swimming
always do your best.

61
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,040
I think I'm like the only swimmer
in the world that cannot float.

62
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,560
Damn ! My gosh !

63
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,760
What defines me ? Ryan Lochte.

64
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,920
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns school.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,640
If Pink Floyd had gone to one,

66
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,800
they'd have known it's
"we don't need any education".

67
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,840
You undermined your point.

68
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,280
It's currently
back to school season.

69
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,320
And for millions,
will be a charter school,

70
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,880
the things that politicians
love to praise.

71
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,200
I called for doubling investment
in charter schools.

72
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,560
- I'm a believer in charter schools.
- I believe in public charter schools.

73
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,560
Charter schools work very well.

74
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,240
Almost every politician can find
something good to say about them.

75
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,560
Yes, charter schools
unite both sides of the aisle

76
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,680
more quickly than when
a wedding DJ throws on "Hey Ya".

77
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,240
Look at Nana dancing ! We can never
let her know what this song is about.

78
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,600
Charters are public schools that are
taxpayer-funded, but privately run.

79
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,880
The first ones emerged 25 years ago,

80
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,240
as places to experiment
with new educational approaches.

81
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,080
Since then they've exploded:

82
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,880
there are over 6 700 charter schools,
educating almost 3 million students.

83
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,680
And some have celebrity backers,
like Puff Daddy, Andre Agassi,

84
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,000
and even Pitbull, who helped launch
Miami's Slam Academy.

85
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,560
He was a keynote speaker at a
charter school conference in 2013.

86
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,520
And his speech has not aged well,
for painfully clear reasons.

87
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,840
They told me that Bill Cosby
has spoken here before,

88
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,760
which I think is amazing.

89
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,320
Someone that I really relate to.
I also love Jello, you know ?

90
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,000
Yes, yes, that does look bad now.

91
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,880
But to be fair, it was not
commonly known at the time

92
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,640
that Jello was responsible for dozens
of cases of sexual assault.

93
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,400
Turns out, Jello is a monster.
I'm legally okay to say that.

94
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,160
The point is, fuck Jello.

95
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,840
When Pitbull has a charter school,

96
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,880
it seems like it might be worth
taking a look at them.

97
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,400
This is a controversial area.

98
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,320
Charter proponents will point
to positive news stories like this one,

99
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,720
about the KIPP
charter schools network.

100
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,360
KIPP students are chosen by lottery,
regardless of prior academic record.

101
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,280
Almost all meet federal
poverty guidelines.

102
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,600
And yet 82 percent go on to college.

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,800
I think one thing
that I learned at KIPP really well

104
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,840
is that a lot of your effort

105
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,240
doesn't reap any success
until way later in the future.

106
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,680
Any philosophy that can get those
results might be worth considering

107
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,200
in the same way that, if we found out
they boosted our immunity,

108
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,640
we'd seriously
consider eating koalas.

109
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,200
But critics argue
charters overstate their successes,

110
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,600
siphon off talented students and divert
resources within a school district.

111
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,080
I know this is going to make
some people on both sides very angry

112
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,440
we're going to set aside whether or not
charter schools are a good idea.

113
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,240
Because whether they are or not,
in 42 states and DC, we're doing them.

114
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,440
We're going to look
at how they operate in practice.

115
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,560
Charters had a slight edge over
traditional public schools in reading,

116
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,320
and did about the same at math,
but acknowledged,

117
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,160
"charter quality is uneven across
the states and across schools."

118
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,760
There've been charter schools
so flawed,

119
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,520
they don't make it
through the school year.

120
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,240
This charter school suddenly closed
its doors in the middle of the day.

121
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,840
An Orange County charter school
closed its doors.

122
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,080
The local charter school is suddenly
and unexpectedly closing it's doors.

123
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,800
My son left these two notes to us,
one says:

124
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,520
"Dear Mom is the school
going out of business ?"

125
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,880
Yes, you are right: that kid
spelled "business" "bis-nose",

126
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,920
which I'd argue
is a much better way to spell it.

127
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,880
That school was shut down
just six weeks into the school year,

128
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,000
so they should've been much better
at bis-nose.

129
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,720
And charters in some states
can have an alarming failure rate.

130
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,840
Two years ago, a Florida paper
found that, since 2008,

131
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,600
119 charter schools had closed there,

132
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,320
14 of which had never even finished
their first school year.

133
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,560
So 14 schools in Florida were outlasted
by NBC's Mysteries of Laura,

134
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,640
a show which once ended
an episode like this.

135
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,560
- I have a hot date tonight.
- With who ?

136
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,800
Threesome, actually.

137
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,960
That's a threesome joke
about her fucking children.

138
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,920
It was in the first season,
and they gave her another one !

139
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,080
But the point is when schools
close that fast, it's shocking.

140
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,560
You would assume someone
would rigorously screen a school,

141
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,040
making sure it was financially
and academically sound.

142
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,120
But that is not always the case.

143
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,480
Take Florida's Ivy Academies,
which shut down after just seven weeks,

144
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,640
due to a lack of,
among other things, a school.

145
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,400
The schools were repeatedly kicked out,
shuttled students among multiple sites:

146
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,400
the signature grand reception hall,
and two local churches.

147
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,600
They bus students on daily field trips
because they didn't have classrooms.

148
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,480
Daily field trips ?
How's that even possible ?

149
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,520
Surely by day ten,
you've run out of ideas

150
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,440
and are taking kids
to Marshall's to return a belt.

151
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,680
"Pretty great, right, kids ?
I'll probably get store credit,"

152
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,000
"we're about to go on a magical
twelve dollar scavenger hunt !"

153
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,760
How did those schools get approved ?

154
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,560
Florida's charter process
begins with a lengthy application

155
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,840
and Ivy Academy's
was 400 pages long,

156
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,920
and their founder, Trayvon Mitchell,
included passages like this one:

157
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,320
"Instruction is scaffolded
to provide targeted support"

158
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,000
"with the goal
of increasing independence."

159
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,600
It goes on, and it sounds great.
We found this application by a school,

160
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,640
Franklin Academy in Fort Lauderdale,
which predates that by two years,

161
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,640
and which features this passage:
"Instruction will scaffold",

162
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,480
and continues
in almost exactly the same way.

163
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,360
It's basically identical
but for a few small differences.

164
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,200
Like the Olsen twins.
You know one of them came first,

165
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,920
and then Mary Kate
plagiarized her face.

166
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,560
That behavior might not be illegal,
but it's certainly unethical,

167
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,480
or, if I may quote
from the Ivy Academy Handbook:

168
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,160
"You will not plagiarize works
that you find on the Internet."

169
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,240
"Plagiarism is using the ideas
or writings of others."

170
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,880
The application for Mitchell's school

171
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,960
would also have been grounds for him
getting thrown out of that school.

172
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,000
And that's not the only thing
he may have stolen.

173
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,560
He's been accused of spending
funds for students on himself,

174
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,840
and is awaiting trial for grand theft.

175
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,280
And the problem with the approval
process being too easy is,

176
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,760
there is a lot at stake
in charter schools.

177
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,160
They get paid
on a per-student basis,

178
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,680
on average, that's about
$7,000 for every enrollment.

179
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,960
And that adds up. Take Philadelphia's
Harambee charter school.

180
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,080
They named it a long time ago,

181
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,200
and it's spelled differently,
you fucking monsters.

182
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,240
Rest in peace !

183
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:51,000
That school, that school received
more than $5 million in taxpayer money,

184
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,560
the same year that this story emerged.

185
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,000
By day, the Harambee Institute
Charter School looks like any other:

186
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,120
educating some 450 students from
kindergarten through eighth grade.

187
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,320
But by night...

188
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,360
the cafeteria turns into Club Damani,

189
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,000
a bar that authorities say
is unlicensed and illegal.

190
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,480
Hold on ! I had a couple a shots
of Ciroc. I'm drunk up now !

191
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,320
A nightclub in an elementary school
is a recipe for disaster.

192
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,520
Because those are the two most
vomit-prone populations in the world.

193
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,640
They must've had to Febreze
the shit out of that place.

194
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,760
You'll be glad to hear that school's
under new leadership now

195
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,240
although that might be
because its CEO pled guilty to fraud,

196
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,040
for embezzling nearly $80,000
from the Harambee Institute.

197
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,560
Rest in peace.

198
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,200
And you can say: "That's
an isolated incident", but it isn't.

199
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,400
In Philadelphia alone, at least ten
executives or top administrators

200
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,720
have pled guilty in the last decade
to charges like fraud,

201
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,360
misusing funds,
and obstruction of justice.

202
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,320
Which may be why Philly Magazine
advises parents:

203
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,760
"Google any schools you're looking at,"

204
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,000
"to make sure they weren't
once unexpectedly shut down"

205
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,640
"or run by a CEO
who pleaded guilty to theft."

206
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,840
All of which
speaks to a general atmosphere

207
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,680
perhaps best articulated
by the state auditor.

208
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,520
I've said it before,
and I will say it again:

209
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,200
Pennsylvania has the worst charter
school law in the United States.

210
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,520
That is not good.

211
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,200
Because it is not like having the worst
something is new for Pennsylvania.

212
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,480
This is a state that has
the worst football fans, worst bell,

213
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,760
and the worst regional delicacy.

214
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,400
Yes, if I wanted Cheez Wiz
on my steak sandwich,

215
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,440
I would eat at "Kiddie Kafeteria",
the restaurant run by six year olds.

216
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,680
And I'm not even sure Pennsylvania
deserves to be called the worst,

217
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,320
because Ohio's charter law was,
for decades, so lax,

218
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,760
even charter advocates
have called it "the wild west".

219
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,000
The state has around 360 charters,
and their governor, John Kasich,

220
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,280
speaks often about how much he loves
choice and competition in schools.

221
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,840
We will improve the public schools
if there's a sense of competition.

222
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,040
Just like a pizza shop in a town,

223
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,320
if there's only one,
and there's not much pepperoni on it,

224
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,720
you can call
until you're blue in the face.

225
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,640
The best way to get more pepperoni,
is to open up a second pizza shop.

226
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,560
That's what's going to improve
our public schools.

227
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,800
That doesn't work on any level.

228
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,840
No one has ever called it
a "pizza shop".

229
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,280
It's a hard to hear the man
who defunded Planned Parenthood

230
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,480
talk about the importance of choice.

231
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,520
There is such a thing
as paying for extra pepperoni,

232
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,960
like a normal person.

233
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,360
The notion that the more pizza shops
there are, the better pizza becomes,

234
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,720
is effectively undercut
by the two words "Papa John's".

235
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,440
But Ohio's charters have had
huge problems with lack of oversight.

236
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,760
A review of one year's state audits
found charters misspent public money

237
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,320
nearly four times more often than any
other form of taxpayer-funded agency.

238
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,480
And some cases are incredible,
like that of Lisa Hamm,

239
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,200
a school superintendent accused
of spending money for her school

240
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,160
on spas, jewelry, luggage,
plays, veterinary care,

241
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,560
and trips to Europe
and to see Oprah.

242
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,520
She took a plea deal
without admitting guilt,

243
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,760
but not before delivering
this fantastic explanation.

244
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,880
Proverbs says
"Without vision, people perish".

245
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,920
And it's very important for people
to have a vision for their own lives

246
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,760
and in order to do that, they need
to experience what's possible in life.

247
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,280
In order to transfer that
to the children,

248
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,480
they have to experience it
themselves.

249
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,680
That is amazing.

250
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,120
She's spouting a bunch
of vague bullshit about inspiration,

251
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,120
crossing her fingers,
and hoping people will buy it.

252
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,120
When you put it like that, I feel
like she has learned a lot from Oprah.

253
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,520
Money well spent !

254
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,640
For the record,
when she quoted Proverbs, saying:

255
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,320
"Where there is no vision,
the people perish",

256
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,240
she's leaving out the very next line,
which is,

257
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,560
"But he that keepeth the law,
happy is he".

258
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,400
And that's a fucking
important caveat.

259
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,720
There are ways to profit off of charter
schools perfectly legally in Ohio.

260
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,920
And there have been for years. Look
at this episode of Frontline from 2000.

261
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,040
By law,
charter schools must be non-profit.

262
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,600
But the schools can hire an educational
management company to run them,

263
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,440
and the EMO can try to make a profit.

264
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,640
Brennan calls
his EMO White Hat Management.

265
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,480
Education is first,
last and always a business.

266
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,680
If it's run like a business,
it can be done profitably.

267
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,920
"Yes, education is first,
last and always a business."

268
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,960
Take the "l" off the word learning !
"Earning !"

269
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,920
Take the "e" off it,
what do you got then ? "Arning !"

270
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,600
That's not a word, but it could be,
in one of our English classes !

271
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,520
White Hat Management,
worked under contracts.

272
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,960
Each charter would pay 95 percent
of its government funding to White Hat,

273
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,120
which as a private company,
isn't obligated to provide

274
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,440
the same level of transparency
as, say, a school district.

275
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,440
Taxpayers could have little idea
how that money was being spent.

276
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,960
And who can say
if that's a good system or not ?

277
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,840
White Hat ran 32 of the lowest
performing schools in the state.

278
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,280
And if you do the same terrible thing
more than 30 times in a row,

279
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,840
you're basically "Billy Joel's
Greatest Hits Volumes 2 And 3".

280
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,480
You may be thinking charters
were completely unmonitored,

281
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,360
but you would actually be wrong.

282
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,720
They're approved and overseen
by what are called "authorizers".

283
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,320
While some states sharply limit
who can be an authorizer,

284
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,560
Ohio allowed many different groups,
including non-profits, to do it.

285
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,320
I wanted to open the "John Oliver
Academy for Nervous Boys".

286
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,000
And let's say I had
a pre-existing non-profit,

287
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,600
called "Johnny's Kids".

288
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,720
That could potentially
have overseen my school.

289
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,560
And that basically happened.

290
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,320
Take the Richard Allen chain
of schools in Ohio,

291
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,760
whose president was
Jeanette Harris.

292
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,920
Overseen by Kids Count,
a nonprofit founded by Jeanette Harris,

293
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,480
which oversaw the schools as they
spent $1 million tax dollars

294
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,640
on management and consulting firms
founded by... Jeanette fucking Harris.

295
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,040
Harris denies a conflict of interest,

296
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,040
she claims she wasn't
involved in decision-making.

297
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,280
Maybe the schools just
chose Kids Count

298
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,800
because it had a proven
track record of great oversight.

299
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,320
So let's just check in on one
of the other schools they oversaw.

300
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,960
A local charter school padded
its attendance records,

301
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,160
resulting in more than
a million dollars in extra money.

302
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,960
State auditors interviewed
students and staff.

303
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:14,040
On any given day, there would only be
about thirty students in the building,

304
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,080
a fraction of the reported
459 enrolled there.

305
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,640
When an auditor looked into it,

306
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,840
they found Kids Count had done
"legal minimum oversight required".

307
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,440
Which I would argue suggests
a problem with the legal minimum.

308
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,760
Because 30 kids showed up and
the school claims they had 450.

309
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,240
Doesn't speak well
of an oversight group

310
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,200
calling itself "Kids Count".

311
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,760
Ohio has passed a new law to clean up
some of the problems,

312
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,240
but serious damage
has already been done.

313
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,920
There is one more way that charter
schools have been allowed to run wild.

314
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,320
We haven't even mentioned
online charters yet.

315
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,840
They serve 180 000 students

316
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,120
and even if they get the average
$7 000 per student,

317
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,600
that's over a billion dollars
going to cyber-charters annually.

318
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,040
Some have an attendance system
you would not believe.

319
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,960
Sometimes,
kids aren't counted absent

320
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,000
until they have failed to log on
for five days in a row.

321
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,120
And some are never
required to attend class.

322
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,880
But the state still requires
the schools to report attendance.

323
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,800
So most just report 100%, even
though that's not what's going on.

324
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,400
That's crazy. You're giving kids
a box containing video games,

325
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,120
pornography,
and long division and claiming:

326
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,600
"100 percent of them
chose the right one."

327
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,920
Some kids might need
online education,

328
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
but it has got to be monitored better

329
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,480
because one study found
students in online charters

330
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,120
lost the equivalent of 72 days
of learning in reading

331
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,640
and 180 days in math during the course
of a 180-day school year.

332
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,560
And 180 minus 180 is, as those
kids might put it, three.

333
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,360
Charter advocates will tell you that
are concerned about online schools.

334
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,200
And some states have better oversight
than the ones that we've seen.

335
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,120
Though, for the record,
some may even be worse.

336
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,600
One charter researcher told Ohio:

337
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,040
"Be very glad that you have Nevada,
so you are not the worst."

338
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,280
Which I believe is the motto
on Nevada state license plates.

339
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,040
The point is we don't even
have time to get into Nevada.

340
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,040
Advocates will argue these closings
show accountability in action.

341
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,400
Like in business,
bad schools close.

342
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,480
There's a problem, as one former
charter school employee explains.

343
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,160
This isn't a restaurant
that you just open up,

344
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,080
you serve your food, people
don't like it, you close it, move on.

345
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,160
This is education. Students are left
without a school to go to.

346
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,280
There needs to be some filter as
to who's opening up these schools.

347
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,920
The problem with letting the free
market decide when it comes to kids

348
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,240
is that kids change faster
than the market.

349
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,720
By the time it's obvious a school is
failing, futures may have been ruined.

350
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,280
So if we are going to treat
charter schools like "pizza shops",

351
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,800
we should monitor them at least
as well as we do pizzerias.

352
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,440
It's like the old saying:

353
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,120
give a kid a shitty pizza,
you fuck up their day.

354
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,480
Treat a kid like a shitty pizza,
you could fuck up their entire life.

355
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,480
And now this.

356
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,160
And now, one final second
of Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte

357
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,840
that encapsulates his personality,
career and worldview.

358
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,440
And finally tonight,
we turn to Donald Trump,

359
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,440
a racist voodoo doll
made of discarded cat hair.

360
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,920
Let me just say how truly sorry I am
to have to talk about him again.

361
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,040
I know I've done it a lot recently.

362
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,480
But we're going to be
off the air for a month

363
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,720
and there are some things
I need to say.

364
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,760
This week, Trump
continued to struggle in the polls,

365
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,360
his campaign director resigned
and it seems he's taking advice

366
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,840
from Roger Ailes, a sexually
rapacious hard-boiled egg.

367
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,440
And this feels like a fork
in the road for Trump.

368
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,680
He's either hitting bottom
and he'll rebound to victory,

369
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,240
or it's the beginning of the end,
so let's look at his options.

370
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,000
'Cause obviously,
losing would be disastrous.

371
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,360
His entire brand
is built around not doing that.

372
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,000
I know how to win. That's what
I've been doing all my life.

373
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,680
I don't do it unless I win.

374
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,880
I know how to win because
my whole life I've been winning.

375
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,720
My life
has been about winning.

376
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,840
He's like an alien attempting
to impersonate a human,

377
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,520
but his only research was watching
Charlie Sheen interviews.

378
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:03,200
Trump wouldn't be losing any election.
He'd be losing it to Hillary Clinton.

379
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,040
That wouldn't just be off-brand,
it would be brand-destroying.

380
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,240
And he knows it.

381
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,640
Wouldn't that be embarrassing,
to lose to crooked Hillary Clinton ?

382
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,440
Yes, exactly. It would be humiliating
to lose to a candidate

383
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,080
whose trustworthiness is doubted
by 60 percent of registered voters.

384
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,920
That's nearly two thirds.

385
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Clinton is trusted by just one
of the John Mayer trio.

386
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,800
Insane, because by definition,
two of the John Mayer trio,

387
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,120
to some extent, trust John Mayer.

388
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:42,800
The other option is Trump resets,
comes from behind and wins.

389
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,320
And I would argue
that's even worse for him.

390
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,160
He actually has to run the country,
and that means

391
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,120
living in government housing,
conversing with fully-clothed women

392
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,680
and traveling in a plane that doesn't
even have his name on it.

393
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,960
He tried to seem more presidential
by apologizing

394
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,440
and distributing disaster relief
and he looked miserable.

395
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,200
And that's pretty much
all that being president is !

396
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,320
That is why I'd like
to address the rest of this segment

397
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,240
directly to Donald Trump.

398
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,360
I know you're watching, Donald,

399
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,320
because you watch everything
that's said about you.

400
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,200
I'm pretty sure you sleep
in a tanning bed

401
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,200
made out of TVs playing
cable news talking about you.

402
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:29,920
That is an actual photo
taken in an actual nightmare.

403
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,640
It seems that you have
two really bad options here.

404
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,520
If you keep going,
you'll spend the next 11 weeks

405
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,840
injecting poison into bloodstream
that'll take generations to remove

406
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,880
and denying the contest of ideas
a presidential campaign should be.

407
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,760
And after that, you're either going
to win or you're going to lose.

408
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,720
Both those scenarios
end pretty badly for you.

409
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,200
Which is why, Mr. Trump,
Donny, Doniel...

410
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,240
I would like to propose to you
a third option, and that is: drop out.

411
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,800
Simply drop out and tell America
this entire candidacy was a stunt,

412
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,680
a satire designed to expose
the flaws in the system.

413
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,120
You could actually make
a fairly decent case for that.

414
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,480
Although your campaign
was the political equivalent

415
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,920
of a bigoted clown's
blazing funeral pyre,

416
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:27,760
you have accidentally made upwards
of 4 good points during this campaign.

417
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:32,360
Last year, when you were criticized
for donating to Democrats, you said:

418
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,680
Before two months ago,
I gave to everybody.

419
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,480
When they call, I give.
When I need something from them

420
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,280
two years later, three years later,
I call them.

421
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,480
They are there for me.
And that's a broken system.

422
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,480
Any system that requires
phone calls to and from you

423
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,120
is completely shattered.

424
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,400
You are like the chaplain
at Disney jail:

425
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,040
if I'm talking to you at all,
something has gone horribly wrong.

426
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:05,840
But it is powerful hearing a candidate
expose our campaign finance system.

427
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,800
Just as it was powerful to watch
you expose the flaws of the media,

428
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,560
while still exploiting them.

429
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,240
They say that I've had $2 billion
worth of free airtime.

430
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,800
Free airtime comes because
of the controversies you've generated.

431
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,760
- Perhaps.
- Is that why you did it ?

432
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,640
It might be a little bit.

433
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,680
I can't even blame you for that.
You're essentially saying:

434
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,120
"you seem to like dumpster fires,
I'm a pile of oily trash and a match,"

435
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,600
"let's fucking dance."

436
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,720
That might be your wisest insight

437
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,480
since you encouraged your Twitter
followers to love thine enemy.

438
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,760
You didn't use those words.
What you said was:

439
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,480
"every time I speak of the haters
I do so with love and affection."

440
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,760
"They cannot help the fact
that they were born fucked up !"

441
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,040
But that sentiment was,
in its own way, Christlike.

442
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,760
You could even argue
you've effectively exposed the lengths

443
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,120
to which politicians will go
to appease their party's base.

444
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,440
Top Republicans refused to withdraw
their support for you,

445
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,440
even after you feuded
with gold star parents,

446
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,000
insinuated gun activists
could assassinate Hillary Clinton

447
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,320
and encouraged Russia
to hack your opponent's emails.

448
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,160
All these politicians
would have stuck by you

449
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:28,280
if you slapped the six year-old orphan
of a dead veteran with a giant blunt

450
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,680
while yelling "legalize it"
and eating a bald eagle burrito.

451
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,320
But perhaps most powerfully of all,
Mr. Trump, Don, Donathan...

452
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,040
You didn't just expose the flaws
in our political system...

453
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,800
You exposed the flaws in us.

454
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,160
How triumphant it would feel
to say on national television:

455
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,720
"I openly ran on a platform
of impossibly ignorant proposals"

456
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,840
"steeped in racial bigotry
and nobody stopped me..."

457
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,440
"In fact, you embraced me for it.
What the fuck was that about ?"

458
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,040
That would be one of the most
powerful political speeches.

459
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,560
If you drop out in order
to teach America a lesson,

460
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,800
you would not be a loser,
you would be a legend.

461
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,920
There'd be a federal holiday
in your honor,

462
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,160
called "Guy-Who-Decided
Not-To-Be-President's Day"

463
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,280
and it would be
the greatest day ever.

464
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,120
Sounds far-fetched. You're probably
wondering how it would all even work.

465
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,920
What if I told you there was
a foolproof instruction manual ?

466
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,840
You'd be interested, right ?

467
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,840
What if this manual was written
at the fifth-grade reading level ?

468
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,920
You'd be very interested, right ?
Guess what ?

469
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:45,440
We found this 1996 book for children
called "The Kid Who Ran For President"

470
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,320
and believe me:
this is basically about you.

471
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,920
It's the story of Judson Moon,
a somewhat bored classclown

472
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,840
who runs for president as a joke.

473
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,920
And some of his character traits
might ring a bell.

474
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,000
He refers to his potential spouse
as "The First Babe"

475
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,640
and he says "my job, as
a candidate for highest office,"

476
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,520
"is to come up with good quotes."

477
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,200
Which I'm sure
reminds you of someone.

478
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,560
I have the best words.

479
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,280
Exactly.

480
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:21,800
Judson Moon expressed his idea using
18 words, 23 syllables and a subclause

481
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,520
while you just said:
"I have the best words",

482
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,240
but the point is,
it's basically the same idea.

483
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,120
Like you, the kid soon realizes that
he can basically propose anything

484
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,840
and a segment of
the population will buy into it.

485
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:39,360
I know you are not much of a reader,
which is why we got Will Arnett

486
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,480
to record the book's description
of the kid's first campaign speech !

487
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,120
My first official act as president
of the United States

488
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,040
will be to abolish homework,
now and forever !

489
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,240
A huge roar of approval went up.
It was pandemonium.

490
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,280
I paused to allow them to calm down.
I didn't want to incite a riot.

491
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,480
No more homework !

492
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,320
Chanted the school as one.
The dumbest guys seemed happy,

493
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,480
fist bumping me and saying
stuff like: "Awesome, dude."

494
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:14,080
You hear that ? If you replace
the words "no more homework"

495
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,920
with "build that wall", that's
every single one of your rallies.

496
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,240
But wait: there's more.

497
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,880
The kid realizes he's riding
something he can't control,

498
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,400
and he bemoans the fact he could
"tell supporters the Earth was flat".

499
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,320
Does that sound familiar ?

500
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,440
I could stand on 5th Avenue and shoot
somebody and I wouldn't lose voters.

501
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,520
Come on, the parallels
are fucking uncanny here !

502
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,200
This fictional 12-year-old boy sounds
vastly more reasonable than you,

503
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,520
an actual 70-year-old man,
but you get my point here.

504
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,600
Here is where we get
to the stuff that you can actually use,

505
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,480
because despite the kid's efforts
to sabotage himself, he's elected

506
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,080
and that is when, shocked and
disgusted by his fellow Americans,

507
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,720
he resigns
and delivers the following speech,

508
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,120
which you could deliver
word for word.

509
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,000
I have a question
for the grown-ups of America.

510
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,960
Are you out of your minds ?

511
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,120
Are you expecting me
to enforce the constitution ?

512
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,000
I never even read it. I was absent
from school that day.

513
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,080
You want me commander-in-chief
of the armed forces ?

514
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,240
What if somebody attacked the US ?
Would you really want me in charge ?

515
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,400
America must be in really bad shape
if you elected me president.

516
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,080
Get it together and find
qualified people to run this country

517
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,480
or we'll all be in big trouble.

518
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,840
That is a perfectly Trumpean address:
it's a negation of responsibility,

519
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,520
an implication of everyone else's
stupidity, and it's a threat !

520
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,560
If you steal it, you'll be passing off
someone else's speech as your own,

521
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,480
which I know is kind of
a "thing" for your campaign.

522
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,880
This book is your only way out from
two equally unappealing scenarios.

523
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,840
I'm even willing to help you out,
with a personal sacrifice.

524
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,160
'Cause I have never wanted you
to appear on this show.

525
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,560
I believe I have said you will
never be invited here.

526
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,880
But I'm willing to invite you,

527
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,360
if you are willing to deliver
that exact speech to the nation.

528
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,520
And to make you feel at home,
we've even built that weird,

529
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,960
black and gold podium that you used
at the Republican convention.

530
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,800
Remember ? The creepy one
that looks like the podium

531
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,120
the Empire would use to announce
it's going to strike back.

532
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,400
So, Mr. Trump, Don, Dondrew...

533
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,560
Back in February, I stood here
and I called you

534
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,000
a two-bit bullshit artist
conning America to help himself.

535
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,800
Please, prove me wrong

536
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,160
and show yourself to be
a three-bit bullshit artist

537
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,520
conning America to help America.

538
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,000
Embrace your destiny, as the real-life
kid who ran for president,

539
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,640
for all of our sakes.

540
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,560
That is our show. We'll be back
September 25th. Good night !

541
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,200
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

542
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,360
