LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,120
SEASON III
EPISODE 10

3
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,520
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,840
Thank you so much for joining us.
Time for a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,680
And we begin in Saudi Arabia.
The Mecca of meccas.

6
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,600
President Obama visited Saudi Arabia
for a summit of gulf leaders,

7
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,800
but right from the moment he arrived,
it seemed something was a little off.

8
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,280
The king did not greet Mr. Obama
at the airport,

9
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,800
instead sending
a lower-level delegation.

10
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,200
He was met at the airport,
by the governor of Riyadh,

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,000
who is a royal, but is not
a senior figure in the government.

12
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,200
That is a snub.

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,760
You send a governor to meet
the president of the United States ?

14
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,600
Imagine if King Salman
arrived in America

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,600
and was greeted at the airport
by Arizona governor Doug Ducey.

16
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,720
That would not be acceptable even if
he was moonlighting as a limo driver.

17
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,520
And, and just in case the snub
was not clear enough,

18
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,360
the Saudi king had been shown
on television earlier in the day,

19
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,840
greeting the leaders
of neighboring states at the airport.

20
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,280
It's like finding out

21
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,840
your parents didn't forget to pick
you up from soccer practice.

22
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,720
They showed up, bought an ice cream
for a bunch of other kids,

23
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,080
and then intentionally left
without you.

24
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,280
It does seems pretty clear
at this point,

25
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,840
the Saudis cannot wait
until this president leaves office.

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,400
They believe that the next president,
Hillary Clinton or even Donald Trump,

27
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,040
will be able to restore
Saudi Arabia's status

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,880
as America's key ally
in the Mideast.

29
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,480
That makes sense: Donald Trump
has a lot in common with the Saudis.

30
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,800
They both inherited wealth,
hate neighboring countries,

31
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,400
and have a decorating style
best described as

32
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,720
"King Midas and Elvis
design a brothel".

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,360
But despite all this tension,

34
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,720
the president tried to smooth
things over during his speech,

35
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,960
although judging by the camerawork
on the Saudi news feed,

36
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,880
it may not have gone over great.

37
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,320
When we look back on the past year,
a lot has gotten done.

38
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,520
I'm confident that a year from now,
we will be able to say that

39
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,080
because of these actions,
all of our nations are more peaceful

40
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,560
and more secure
and more prosperous.

41
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,080
And it underscores the enduring
friendship and partnership.

42
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,920
It's like the camera actually said:
"My god, Obama, shut uuuuup !"

43
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,400
"You are so boring !"

44
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,160
So let's move on to the UK,

45
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,200
a country that gave the world Beatles
and punished it with Coldplay.

46
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,880
The UK also got a visit
from the president this week,

47
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,200
although their royals gave him
a somewhat warmer welcome.

48
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,640
The queen herself in an extraordinary
gesture of friendship

49
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,480
coming out with Prince Phillip
to greet the Obamas.

50
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,680
94-year-old Prince Phillip
even drove them to lunch.

51
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,400
I have never been driven
by a duke of Edinburgh before,

52
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,240
and I can report
that it was very smooth riding.

53
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,120
Sure. Although, let's be honest:

54
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,600
any ride with a 94-year-old
man behind the wheel

55
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,120
that doesn't end with your skull
shattered against a tree

56
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,800
counts as a "smooth ride".

57
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,520
And those were not the only royals
greeting the Obamas on this visit.

58
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,960
A royal handshake
from little Prince George,

59
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,360
up past his bedtime
to meet the president.

60
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,000
The toddler in a spa robe,
matching pajamas and slippers.

61
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,880
All of it shared
on the young royal's Twitter feed.

62
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,480
"That robe, OMG, so sweet",
one follower wrote,

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,440
and "the most adorable
display of a power dynamic ever."

64
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,720
Is it, though? I would say it's
a little demeaning for the president

65
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,360
to have to crouch down and greet
a toddler dressed as Hugh Heffner.

66
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,240
Although, to be fair, this trip
was not all royal photo ops.

67
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,880
The president also spoke out
in favor of Britain staying in the EU,

68
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,960
something that enraged
London's mayor Boris Johnson,

69
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,080
and he did not hold back.

70
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,120
In an article for a right-wing tabloid,
Johnson slammed Obama

71
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,680
for taking a bust of Winston Churchill
out of the oval office.

72
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,600
Johnson wrote that Obama was
compelled to oppose the UK due to:

73
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,320
"the part-Kenyan president's ancestral
dislike of the British empire."

74
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,880
Holy shit !
Or to put that another way:

75
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,920
"he may not like us because
of our history of racism,"

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,040
Boris Johnson said, racistly.

77
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,160
And, I'll say this:
it's a little hard to hear a man

78
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,000
reduce Obama's views to him
being "part Kenyan"

79
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,840
when that man is himself
clearly part Cabbage Patch Kid.

80
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,920
And lastly this week,
we turn to, Norway,

81
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,240
the left testicle in the frigid
sea-penis of Scandinavia.

82
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,040
Norway's current government
has come in for criticism recently

83
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,840
for its response
to the Syrian migrant crisis,

84
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,600
which has included
drafting an asylum policy

85
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,800
they call
"one of Europe's toughest",

86
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,640
and deporting nearly 10,000 people
since the beginning of last year.

87
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,600
This has been overseen by their
immigration minister, Sylvi Listhaug,

88
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,320
perhaps the most Norwegian-looking
human being who has ever lived.

89
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,800
In an attempt to soften her image,
she traveled to the Mediterranean

90
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,880
and jumped into the water to experience
what it was like to be a migrant.

91
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,200
Which already sounds stupid.
Then you see what she was wearing.

92
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,040
Okay. I think the most ridiculous
part of this stunt

93
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,840
is that this looks
genuinely pleasant.

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,160
I would happily
spend my next vacation

95
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,680
gently floating in the Mediterranean
in a giant pumpkin suit.

96
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,920
Listhaug did insist that she had
learned something from the experience.

97
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,840
Safely onboard the boat again,
Listhaug has a new perspective.

98
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,680
To see a boat like this when you're
drowning, that must be amazing.

99
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,360
But how is "seeing a boat
when you're drowning is nice"

100
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,640
something
you did not already know ?

101
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,840
And for the record:
that is not drowning.

102
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,600
That's floating around giggling
dressed like an aquatic Cheeto.

103
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,760
There is no doubt:

104
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,840
European policy-makers
need a better understanding

105
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,560
of the dangers
faced by migrants and refugees.

106
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,400
If belly flopping around Mediterranean
like a dolphin on Quaaludes

107
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,960
helps you do that,
maybe it's a good thing.

108
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,680
Because until now, Listhaug has been
pretty tone-deaf on this issue.

109
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,640
Back in November,
she justified Norway's decision

110
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,000
to turn refugees away
by invoking Jesus.

111
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,960
I think that Jesus would see that
we have to help as many as possible.

112
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,040
That was what Jesus
was concerned with,

113
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,920
that you should help
as many as possible

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,520
and that's not about
helping many in Norway.

115
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,120
Obviously, she's living by one
of Jesus' most remembered sayings:

116
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,120
"Do unto others as you
would have others do unto you,"

117
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,120
"offer not applicable in Norway,
a country that does not exist yet."

118
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,240
And now this !

119
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,720
And now, everyone likes
mispronouncing "Target".

120
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,440
Target...
Or should I say, Target ?

121
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,360
Our sophisticated Vicki says "Target".
What do you think, Vicki ?

122
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,000
I think they're upscale Target.

123
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,720
- That's Target.
- Some people call it Target.

124
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,800
- You remember Target ?
- It might be back to Target now.

125
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,400
Everyone was crazy
about Target or Target.

126
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,280
They are a long way
from Target.

127
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,720
It doesn't have Target
cache that it once had.

128
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,000
Our next one, from Target.
Target, as we like to say.

129
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,600
- How do you feel about Target ?
- I love to hear that, Gayle.

130
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,960
Moving on: our main story tonight
concerns Puerto Rico.

131
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,960
The island that, for decades,

132
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,960
has been marketed to us
as a beautiful vacation spot.

133
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,080
The commonwealth of Puerto Rico,
a land of song and laughter.

134
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,560
Coconut milk,
that delicious Puerto Rican rum.

135
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,440
This is really living.

136
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,600
It's the revival of an old
coconut mask festival at Loiza,

137
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,200
just 45 minutes from San Juan.

138
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,480
And how'd you like
to see this the morning after ?

139
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,440
Wait ! Did that 1950s narrator
just make a sex joke ?

140
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,200
"If you've got the moxie,"

141
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,520
"you can fuck every crazy
masked stranger on the island ! "

142
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,480
"But Puerto Rico is an island
of 3 and a half million people."

143
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,440
And they are currently facing

144
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,840
a horror even greater than
a demonic slipknot coconut mask.

145
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,800
Puerto Rico
is in desperate financial trouble.

146
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,720
Puerto Rico is facing a $70 billion
public debt amid a 10-year crisis.

147
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,920
Considering the state of our economy,
the debt is not payable.

148
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,280
This is not politics.

149
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,080
This is math.

150
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,120
That is bad.
Because "this is math"

151
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,040
is one of the most dreadinducing
sentences in the English language,

152
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,520
even when it's uttered at the start
of an actual math class.

153
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,160
It's right up there with
"It'll never grow back"

154
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,960
and, "Mommy, whiskers has been
napping for a really long time".

155
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,920
Puerto Rico is currently
around $70 billion in debt,

156
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,200
and it is wreaking havoc
on the island.

157
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,320
The poverty rate
is a staggering 45%.

158
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,200
Last year alone, over 80,000
people left for the mainland US.

159
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,880
Puerto Rico has shut down more
than 150 schools in the last years.

160
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,320
The cash-strapped government
has dramatically hiked sales taxes,

161
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:30,280
from 7 percent to 11.5 percent far
higher than any in the United States.

162
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,080
Yes, right now Puerto Rico
is like the last Tower Records.

163
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,240
Everything's overpriced,
everyone's being laid off,

164
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,720
and there's still a weirdly large
number of Ricky Martin CDs.

165
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,320
And remember,
Americans have a personal stake here.

166
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,880
Puerto Ricans
are American citizens.

167
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,600
And they and their descendants
include some of our finest judges,

168
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,440
both of our laws, and our idols.

169
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,920
They're some of our top athletes,
and our top Guzmans.

170
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,960
Just this week, just this week,
Lin-Manuel Miranda,

171
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,040
the son of Puerto Rican parents,
won the Pulitzer Prize for "Hamilton",

172
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,320
the Broadway smash
he created and stars in.

173
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,960
Last month, he made a heartfelt plea
to congress on Puerto Rico's behalf.

174
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,760
If I can leave you with anything today,
our island is in crisis,

175
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,640
and if I can help in any way,

176
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,560
if I can get more eyeballs to
this crisis, it's a fixable problem.

177
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,400
I'm urging congress...

178
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,440
if Hamilton tickets will help,
I'm happy to do that, too.

179
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,920
That is incredible, 'cause I'm amazed
even he can get tickets.

180
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,720
It is easier for a meerkat
to get into Harvard Law School

181
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,920
than it is to get in to that show.

182
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,400
And quick side note here:
congress should take him up on that.

183
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,160
The show is amazing.

184
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,840
Have you seen that clip
from when he performed

185
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,880
a work-in-progress version
of the opening song ?

186
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,480
The word got around,
they said, his kid is insane, man.

187
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,040
Took up a collection just to send him
to the mainland get your education,

188
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,160
don't forget from whence you came,
and the world is gonna know your name.

189
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,080
What's your name, man ?
Alexander Hamilton.

190
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,880
It's so fucking good !
It's so good !

191
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,920
We owe Puerto Rico for that man.

192
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,040
How did we get to the point
where members of congress

193
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,240
are being offered Broadway tickets
to save Puerto Rico ?

194
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,080
Much of it has to do with the fact
that as we have talked about before,

195
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,720
Puerto Rico is not a state, but rather,
as a 1901 Supreme Court case stated,

196
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,280
it is a territory that is "foreign
to the US in a domestic sense".

197
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,760
Which sounds
like what a liquor store clerk says

198
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,520
to try and sell surplus cases
of Miller High life.

199
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,160
"You're looking
for a quality foreign beer ?"

200
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,760
"I'd call this foreign
in a domestic sense."

201
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,040
We don't need to settle tonight
the question of Puerto Rican statehood.

202
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,840
That is a complicated issue on which
many Puerto Ricans disagree.

203
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,960
But one thing is for sure:
because it's a territory,

204
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,160
many laws that apply to the states
have loopholes concerning Puerto Rico.

205
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,200
And as you will see time
and time again in this piece,

206
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,880
those little legal quirks
have had massive consequences,

207
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,080
some good,
but many utterly devastating.

208
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,480
And let's start with a quirk
many Puerto Ricans liked: Section 936.

209
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,040
It gave tax breaks
to encourage businesses

210
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,480
that would otherwise
have moved overseas,

211
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,680
to move to Puerto Rico,
and it worked.

212
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,520
In the 1970's, the US government
helped attract business to Puerto Rico

213
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,920
by granting generous tax breaks.

214
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,080
That led to a booming
manufacturing sector,

215
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,520
particularly pharmaceutical companies.

216
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,760
At its peak, the island was home
to 89 drug manufacturing plants.

217
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,800
All of a sudden, Puerto Rico
was a pharmaceutical paradise.

218
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,720
At its peak,
the small city of Barceloneta

219
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,400
even housed
14 pharmaceutical and other plants,

220
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,920
including one that produced Viagra.

221
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,960
That plant was such a source of pride
that the town's mayor has said,

222
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,800
"We're responsible
for a lot of good moments,"

223
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,960
which is one step away from
outright changing the town's motto to,

224
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,120
"Barceloneta:
you're welcome for that boner."

225
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,400
Unfortunately for Puerto Rico,
congress got rid of those tax breaks

226
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,200
to offset a tax cut on the mainland,
phasing them out completely by 2006.

227
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,560
Between that,
and the US recession,

228
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,440
Puerto Rico lost
over half its manufacturing jobs,

229
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:35,600
putting its economy into a state
that no amount of Viagra could fix.

230
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,400
To pay its bills, their government
started issuing municipal bonds.

231
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,520
And a municipal bond
is basically an IOU...

232
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,720
Puerto Rico borrows money, promising
to pay it back later with interest.

233
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,080
And for years,
people lined up to buy those bonds.

234
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,440
Because thanks to some other quirks
in the law they were very attractive.

235
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Congress decided bonds from
Puerto Rico would be triple tax exempt.

236
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,400
Those who buy them

237
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,200
don't have to pay federal,
state or local taxes on the bonds.

238
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,440
The money you earned
on them was triple tax exempt,

239
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,080
anywhere in the US, and triple
is the best you can have,

240
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,200
like triple fudge brownies !

241
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,920
Because double fudge is shit
and quadruple fudge doesn't exist,

242
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,240
because what would
the fourth fudge be ?

243
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,560
Wall Street loved those tax breaks,
as well as the fact

244
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,360
that thanks to yet another legal quirk
they themselves lobbied for,

245
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,240
they stash bonds in funds without
putting "Puerto Rico" in the name.

246
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,400
You might even own Puerto Rican
bonds and not even know it.

247
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,520
Oppenheimer's Maryland municipal fund

248
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,200
is made up of 50.4 percent
Puerto Rico bonds, which is insane.

249
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,480
If you are more than half something,
that is what you should be called.

250
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,800
Even Taco Bell makes sure
their ground beef is

251
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,480
less than fifty percent
squirrel lips.

252
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,880
The rest is a combination of raccoon
dicks and weasel knees.

253
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,440
Puerto Rico even went
a step further to entice Wall Street

254
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,760
writing into constitution, language
suggesting that certain bondholders

255
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,480
would be paid first,
ahead of anything else,

256
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,360
including funding
basic government services.

257
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:24,080
Which is pretty fucked up.
The US owes $1.2 trillion to China,

258
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,600
but if you called 911,
you would not expect them to say:

259
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm sorry. We chose to send our
fire truck money to Beijing.

260
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,240
Have you tried blowing
on the fire really hard ?

261
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,840
Provisions like that
kept the money flowing in,

262
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,600
and as their former governor puts it,
Puerto Rico got hooked.

263
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,440
They were attractive
in the marketplace

264
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,880
and Puerto Rico actually got addicted,
I would say, to it,

265
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:56,560
and so it was a lot easier to borrow
as opposed to making tough decisions.

266
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,840
That is true, but you were governor
for many of those years.

267
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,600
Hearing you complain
about addiction

268
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:10,080
is like hearing Keith Richards complain
about Rolling Stones' drug problem.

269
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,680
It was you, Keith !

270
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:17,560
You're the only Rolling Stone whose
blood was a controlled substance !

271
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,840
There was one more quirk here,
which made Puerto Rico a time bomb.

272
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:29,320
Unlike states, Puerto Rico cannot
authorize chapter 9 bankruptcy.

273
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,880
Which is huge,
because think about that:

274
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,120
if you are in debt and you can't
declare bankruptcy, you are stuck.

275
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,640
And this happened because of
a tiny amendment to a law in 1984.

276
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,000
And the crazy thing is,
no one can say why it was written.

277
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:50,720
Interesting that chapter 9 applied
to Puerto Rico from 1933 to 1984.

278
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,400
And then mysteriously,
Puerto Rico was exempt from chapter 9.

279
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,240
A provision was stuck into a larger
bill with no explanation or debate.

280
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,840
No legislative history to explain
why Puerto Rico was singled out.

281
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,840
He's right. So the next time
your obnoxious friend tells you

282
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,000
"everything happens for a reason",
you can simply say:

283
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,920
No, Dan. Not the 1984 provision
exempting Puerto Rico from bankruptcy.

284
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,320
So shut the fuck up.

285
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,040
We even tried to find out why
that amendment got attached.

286
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,360
We knew Strom Thurmond
had proposed it,

287
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,560
we asked an archivist at the library
to go through the relevant papers.

288
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,600
And they came up with nothing.
Might be the best-case scenario,

289
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,560
because usually when it comes
to Strom Thurmond,

290
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,640
the answer to the question:
"where did this come from ?"

291
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,320
is either his testicles
or fervent racism.

292
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:58,640
With massive debt promised to pay
ahead of government services,

293
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,520
and no access to bankruptcy,
Puerto Rico was fucked.

294
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,800
But wait: because we're only
getting started here.

295
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,240
Four years ago,
in an attempt to turn things around,

296
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,800
they embarked on a disastrous plan
to lure in wealthy individuals

297
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,520
by exempting them
from capital gains taxes,

298
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,440
which you have to admit,
is pretty good rich people bait.

299
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:27,000
It's right up there with tiny dogs
in bags, and big dumb round ice cubes.

300
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,760
"They're colder
when they're round, you know".

301
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,640
The government even created
a video to sell mainlanders on moving,

302
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,280
featuring a businessman talking
in condescending tones

303
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,880
about how unexpectedly
civilized life in Puerto Rico is.

304
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,000
What we found, first of all,
was a thriving business community.

305
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,200
Established, solid,
like the United States.

306
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,960
In terms of family, I must say
I was skeptical at first.

307
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,560
But in the end, the island
has everything you might need.

308
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:06,280
Great possibilities. I visited schools,
top level, in English.

309
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,440
I saw living alternatives up
to our standards, I felt safe.

310
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,760
There's so many little treasures
you want to explore,

311
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,120
complemented with all the necessities
you and your family are accustomed to.

312
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,680
That level of colonial tone makes me
cringe, and I'm fucking English.

313
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,360
The buildings had roofs,
the cars had wheels on them, but wait:

314
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,320
they also had indoor plumbing
and the printed word !

315
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,960
While those tax breaks were part of
a plan to create 50 000 jobs,

316
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,520
a study later found they only
directly created 5 800.

317
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,120
That's twelve percent.
If an ER doctor told you:

318
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,320
"Congratulations. We got 12 percent
of the GI Joe out of your rectum !"

319
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,520
You would not consider that
a job well done.

320
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:02,440
While those who relocated have gotten
out of paying $420 million in taxes,

321
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:07,080
Puerto Ricans have been suffering
the effects of savage government cuts,

322
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,600
including hospitals
struggling to keep the lights on.

323
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,920
Puerto Rico's debt problem
has gotten so dire,

324
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,560
the power authority cut off
a hospital that's behind on its bill.

325
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,160
The electric power authority waited

326
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,920
until surgeries were done
before pulling the plug.

327
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,640
That's nice. They waited
'till surgeries were done.

328
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,880
Only the people on life support

329
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,480
have to worry about the switch
to bicyclepowered generators.

330
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,080
Pedal faster, Louis,
we're losing him !

331
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,600
And with working
conditions like those,

332
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,320
is it any wonder that
one doctor a day leaves Puerto Rico ?

333
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,280
That is an attrition rate
rivaling that of Grey's Anatomy.

334
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,040
How have so many of you died ?
You work in a hospital !

335
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,480
The truly tragic thing here is,

336
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,040
Puerto Rico may soon need
those doctors more than ever.

337
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,400
They expect the Zika virus to
infect 1 in 5 people in Puerto Rico.

338
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:15,520
The island of Puerto Rico has seen
450 confirmed cases of the virus.

339
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:20,520
So, on top of debt,
industrial collapse, school closures,

340
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,160
and a sudden influx
of tax-dodging assholes,

341
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,600
now Puerto Rico has to worry
about deadly mosquitos.

342
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,680
It's like the island is being hit

343
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,360
with all the plagues that god
felt were too 'thinky' for the bible.

344
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,040
Puerto Rico could rightly
cry out to its creditors for mercy.

345
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,280
A lot of its creditors are
now hedge funds,

346
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,240
who thrive on this kind of chaos.

347
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,720
Hedge funds often invest
in debt-ridden economies,

348
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,800
buying up bonds at low prices and
looking to flip them for profits.

349
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,280
And Puerto Rico
is their latest target.

350
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,960
The strategy has earned them
a reputation as "vulture" funds.

351
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,280
30 percent of Puerto Rican debt
is now held by vulture funds.

352
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,320
And if you are alone in the desert
and see vultures perched above

353
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,920
your first thought is never:
"the vultures are coming to help !"

354
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,000
These funds
lived up to their name,

355
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,760
with a group of them producing
a report titled:

356
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,080
"For Puerto Rico,
There's a Better Way",

357
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,640
suggesting budget cuts like cutting
excess Medicaid benefits

358
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,600
and reducing the number
of teachers on the island.

359
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,440
So shaving money out of medicine
and education is your better way ?

360
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:42,680
At least change the title to:
"Puerto Rico, Fuck You, Pay Me."

361
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,240
Congress is currently considering
a bipartisan bill

362
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:55,000
that would give Puerto Rico breathing
room to negotiate with creditors.

363
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,400
If this is done well, it could
be a real help to Puerto Rico.

364
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,640
Unfortunately, there is now
a coordinated campaign to kill it.

365
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,680
Who will bail out Puerto Rico ?
Washington says you will.

366
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:11,080
Retirement accounts crushed,
a bailout on the backs of seniors.

367
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,760
Tell congress, stop the Washington
bailout of Puerto Rico.

368
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,080
Everything you just saw
was bullshit.

369
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,200
First, it's not a "bailout."
No one is suggesting a cash infusion.

370
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,360
That ad wasn't paid for by
"savers and seniors",

371
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,920
but by "the center
for individual freedom",

372
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,720
who've spent
nearly $2 million on ads like that.

373
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,040
A dark money group. Impossible to say
where that money came from.

374
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,320
Hedge funds gave them
the money.

375
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,560
It's impossible to say.
Hedge funds. Impossible.

376
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,440
Even the sad old people
featured in that ad are bullshit,

377
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,000
because they're all
stock footage models.

378
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,040
And if you let the stock footage
of the man with the mustache play out,

379
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,280
he's not even sad because
he starts fucking smiling.

380
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,200
You can make him react !
Stock footage man !

381
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,760
You've been used
in a manipulative attack ad !

382
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,040
Don't be sad,
let's get some ice cream !

383
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,960
Bad news, they're out of ice cream !
But they have cake !

384
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,880
Pound cake, though.
With strawberries !

385
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,600
Stock footage man, you're
America's greatest living actor !

386
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,520
This is not to say that regular
bondholders have not been hurt.

387
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:37,360
Some Puerto Rican bondholders may
have got the worst of this.

388
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,080
Some of the bonds were underwritten
by the investment bank UBS,

389
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,160
which sold them to one of
its own divisions, to itself.

390
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,080
UBS then off-loaded those bonds
onto Puerto Rican customers,

391
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,440
even though its own sales force,
felt they were so risky,

392
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,560
they came up with a list
of 22 reasons not to sell them.

393
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,800
And 22 is a lot of reasons to ignore.
If a waiter at Bennigan's

394
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,440
says she has 22 reasons she doesn't
want to sell you the Cobb salad,

395
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,360
you listen to her, and you go
across the street to a Sizzler.

396
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,560
UBS says they did nothing wrong
and technically they're right.

397
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,480
UBS should never have been able
to sell those bonds to themselves,

398
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,880
it's illegal to do that under the
Investment company act of 1940,

399
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,800
but that doesn't apply
in Puerto Rico.

400
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,640
Because apparently, no laws
apply to businessmen down there.

401
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,440
I would not be surprised if,
in Puerto Rico,

402
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,280
hedge fund managers can fly,
due to some bullshit exemption

403
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,080
to the law of gravity Strom Thurmond
wrote up in the fucking 1980s.

404
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:55,840
3.5 million Americans are facing
a dire crisis. The clock is ticking.

405
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,920
Their next debt payment
is due on May first.

406
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,600
They need
relief from hedge fund lawsuits

407
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,320
and an opportunity
to restructure their debt.

408
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,280
We need to stop treating Puerto Rico
like it's just a tax haven

409
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,080
or a place to have terrifying sex with
a stranger in a coconut mask.

410
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:19,240
And start treating it like an island
of American citizens

411
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,480
whose fate is interwoven with ours.

412
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:27,280
There are better voices than mine
to speak on behalf of Puerto Rico.

413
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,080
Luckily, there is someone
with Puerto Rican parents,

414
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,000
and an amazing voice
and he is here tonight.

415
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,840
Please welcome
the great Lin-Manuel Miranda.

416
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,280
My family's from Puerto Rico,
the tropical destination

417
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,680
where you spend your Washingtons,
spot where you vacation.

418
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,120
A commonwealth with not a lot
o 'wealth, a not quite nation.

419
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,680
70 billion dollar topic
of conversation.

420
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,120
Hopin' to god John Oliver's
comical dissertation resonates

421
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,760
with the congress
that got us in this situation

422
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,360
with suicidal tax
incentive declarations.

423
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,280
"We pay your bonds first,
fuck the patients."

424
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,160
This is an island,
a hundred miles across,

425
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,320
a hurricane is coming
and we're runnin' up a lossý

426
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,160
We got here through
misguided loopholes

427
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,120
giveth, take away business
n' poop in our soup bowls.

428
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,840
Crapped in yours ?
Crapped in mine, down the line

429
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,840
Thurmond's ghost busted
a cap in a chance at chapter 9.

430
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,520
The great debate
over statehood has to wait.

431
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,640
Rose and Jack on Titanic
askin', "when's our next date ?"

432
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,480
Ship is sinking, we have
to pay shit that matters,

433
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,360
we'll figure out
Facebook relationship status.

434
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,760
Will they or won't ?
It's Rachel and Ross.

435
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,840
We have to help our island
just a hundred miles across.

436
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,360
Three point five million American
civilians are on the hook for billions.

437
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,160
Vulture funds circling
and lobbying for payout,

438
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,040
there's nothing left to tax or cut,
we need a way out,

439
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,720
there's no structure for what happens

440
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,480
if you let this crisis play out,
May is a day out.

441
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,200
It's non-partisan, the hard part
is in convincing congress

442
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,440
Puerto Rico matters so their
heart is in fight for relief.

443
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,760
Not a bailout, just belief you can
pass legislation to ease our grief.

444
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,600
Paul Ryan, I'll sing
Hamilton at your house,

445
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,360
do-si-do with Pelosi,
wear my Hamilton blouse.

446
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,240
Your citizens are suffering,
stop the loss.

447
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,280
Help Puerto Rico,
it's just a hundred miles across.

448
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,320
Thank you.
Alex Lacamoire on keys.

449
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,520
Lin-Manuel Miranda,
ladies and gentlemen !

450
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,560
That's our show, we're off next week,
thanks for watching, goodnight !

451
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,760
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

452
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,680
END OF EPISODE 10,
SERIES III
