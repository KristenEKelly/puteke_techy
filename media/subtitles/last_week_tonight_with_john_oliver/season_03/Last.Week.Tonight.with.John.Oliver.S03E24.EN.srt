00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,560
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,600
SEASON III
EPISODE 24

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,040
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !

4
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,160
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,080
We begin with the 2016 election,
as it's more commonly known,

6
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,680
"What did I do to deserve this,
I tried to be a good person is this"

7
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,160
"because I stole candy in 4th grade
please stop punishing us" 2016.

8
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,920
This week
saw the first presidential debate.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,440
Donald Trump's performance

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,600
consisted mainly of an incoherent
jumble of sniffles and nonsense,

11
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,440
like a racist toddler
coming out of dental surgery.

12
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,440
And it all culminated
in this amazing assertion.

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,960
I think my strongest asset,
maybe by far, is my temperament.

14
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,720
I have a winning temperament.
I know how to win.

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,560
That is an incredible statement.

16
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,120
If he had said:
"I am a small Korean woman"

17
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,440
it would have been
more believable.

18
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,280
And you can't incoherently rant
about having the best temperament.

19
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,000
That is a claim that disproves itself.

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,120
It's like getting a forehead tattoo:
"I have excelent judgement".

21
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,560
But we then saw what
a "winning temperament" means.

22
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,400
It's a temperament that allows you
to insist that you won something

23
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,160
that you demonstrably lost.

24
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,080
Trump spent the last 7 days
citing his victories

25
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,520
in what he called
"final debate polls",

26
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,240
peppering his rallies
with boasts like this.

27
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,200
And so we won
every single online poll.

28
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,040
Hundreds and hundreds
of thousands of voters.

29
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,000
Almost every single poll

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,960
had us winning the debate
against crooked Hillary Clinton.

31
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,720
Every single online poll
said we won, which is great.

32
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,600
First of all, he did not win
every single online poll.

33
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,480
He didn't win this BuzzFeed poll
about whether candy corn is good.

34
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,360
If you are wondering who did win that,
it was BuzzFeed, you idiots.

35
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,000
BuzzFeed wins every BuzzFeed poll.

36
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,920
The clear problem with online polls

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,240
is that you can vote anonymously
as many times as you want.

38
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,560
That is how, when a British government
agency held a name our ship poll,

39
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,600
the people's overwhelming choice
was "Boaty McBoatface".

40
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,320
It's how, when there was an internet
vote on where Pitbull should perform,

41
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,920
he ended up, and this is true,
in an Alaska Wal-Mart.

42
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,360
And yet, Trump kept citing
these nonsense polls,

43
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,440
as did his media boosters,
like Sean Hannity.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,960
If you look at all the online polls,
the Hill, time.com, Slate,

45
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,760
the list was really long,

46
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,640
Trump won the debate
in these online polls.

47
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,000
And everyone's gonna say
they're not scientific. I hear it.

48
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,720
Do you, though ?
I'm not sure you do.

49
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,360
I'm not sure you even hear
what your own company is saying,

50
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,640
because Fox News sent out an internal
memo saying that such polls, quote:

51
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,240
"Do not meet our editorial standards".

52
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,800
Shocking, since I was pretty sure
Fox News's only "editorial standards"

53
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,520
were "All ladies must be 8's or above"
and "Try not to say the N-word".

54
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,880
The Trump campaign's insistence that
online polls were just as good as real

55
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,280
ones was beginning
to drive people nuts.

56
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,920
The polls that happened that night,
night of the debate,

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,720
the ones that happen online,
those all showed Mr. Trump winning.

58
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,360
What scientific poll
had Donald Trump winning ?

59
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,160
Everything else was...
Those are fan polls, man.

60
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,200
Those are polls that computer
programmers can mess with.

61
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,960
Hillary's got support from the insiders
and from the media,

62
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,400
Mr. Trump's got support
from the people.

63
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,480
Jason, you've been doing this a while.
You know those are bogus !

64
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,720
Look how frustrated he is !
Chuck Todd's head is about to explode.

65
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,240
And this pains him, because
he's talking to a fellow goateewearer.

66
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,520
They stick together against a world
that makes fun of their facial hair.

67
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,760
But there was an even more
inexplicable narrative developing.

68
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,040
Because Trump did score a few points
early on against Hillary Clinton.

69
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,200
He could've spent the whole week
talking about those.

70
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,480
But he fixated on one particular thing
she said towards the end of the night.

71
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,480
One of the worst things he said
was about a woman in a beauty contest.

72
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,120
He called this woman "Miss Piggy",

73
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,160
then "Miss Housekeeping",
because she was Latina.

74
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,840
Donald, she has a name.
Her name is Alicia Machado.

75
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,360
Where did you find it ?

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Why does he care
where she found it ?

77
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,720
Is he flummoxed because it doesn't
come from any of his 3 news sources,

78
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,080
Breitbart,
dudes hanging out at golf club bars,

79
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,080
the minotaur who talks to him in the
one hour that he sleeps every night ?

80
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,080
That Miss Universe moment was
a small part of a 90-minute debate.

81
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,680
So all Trump had to do
was not take the bait.

82
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,520
And yet, the next morning,
he went on Fox & Friends

83
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,640
and, without even being asked,
brought the subject up.

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,040
Watch the anchors' faces as it sinks
in that he is actually doing this.

85
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,480
She was a Miss Universe person
and she was the worst we ever had.

86
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,960
The worst, the absolute worst.
She was impossible,

87
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,720
and she was a Miss Universe
contestant and ultimately a winner

88
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,080
who they had a tremendously
difficult time with as Miss Universe.

89
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,920
- Did not know that story.
- I didn't know either.

90
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,560
She was the winner,
she gained a massive amount of weight,

91
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,360
and it was a real problem.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,520
You can see them thinking:
"What are you doing ?"

93
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,400
"Don't you know it's wrong to degrade
former beauty pageant winners ?"

94
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,240
"We at Fox learned that,
due to the circumstances"

95
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,280
"of Roger Ailes' departure
from this very company."

96
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,280
But Trump still wasn't done.
He pressed the issue all week long

97
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,480
culminating in an online meltdown
in the early hours of Friday morning.

98
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,480
His tweet storm began at 3am
and didn't stop until about ten.

99
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,560
He unloaded on former Miss Universe,
Alicia Machado.

100
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,640
"Did crooked Hillary help disgusting
(check out sex tape and past)"

101
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,160
"Alicia M become a citizen so she
could use her in the debate ?"

102
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,960
That is a candidate
for president of the United States

103
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,760
urging America
to check out a sex tape.

104
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,480
Do me a favor up,
look up into the sky right now.

105
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,760
Higher. No, higher still.

106
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,320
Do you see that, way up there,
way up above the clouds ?

107
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,760
That's rock bottom.
And we are currently way down here.

108
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,560
Not that it makes it any better,

109
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,760
but Trump behaved
equally appallingly to her face,

110
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,400
during a 1997 CBS interview.

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,840
Alicia has done an incredible job.

112
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,000
She has turned out to be one
of the great Miss Universes.

113
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,280
And she had a little problem,
she gained a little weight...

114
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,720
- I don't think so.
- She's probably right.

115
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,160
- I don't think so.
- Okay.

116
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,480
Donald Trump really should've been
prepared for Monday night.

117
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,440
It seems he's been losing televised
debates to women for 20 years now.

118
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:02,120
Amazingly, in that same interview,
it emerged that CBS

119
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,720
would be running an unscientific viewer
poll during the Miss Universe pageant.

120
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,960
Something tells me that Donald Trump
had something to do with the question.

121
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,440
The viewers can call in and vote.
Let's bring up the question.

122
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,760
It says:
"Should a pageant title holder"

123
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,680
"be required to maintain her physical
appearance during her reign ?"

124
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,200
Why do you think
this is an important question ?

125
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,560
That has come up
over the last year.

126
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,760
It came up over that past year because
you made a media circus out of it.

127
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,160
Trump treats his statements
like they're Pokemon:

128
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,360
they're imaginary things
that he nurtures and evolves

129
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,080
and eventually uses
to fight with strangers.

130
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,360
And thus, the two threads
of this week come together:

131
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,880
completely unscientific polling,
which Donald Trump trusts implicitly,

132
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,840
and his deeply held belief
that female weight gain is a betrayal.

133
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,000
So here is the moment of truth:
what were the results of that poll ?

134
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,920
Do you think that Miss Universe,
or the pageant holder,

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,440
should be required to maintain her
physical appearance during her reign ?

136
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,080
Most of the people said no.

137
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,360
How about that, Donald ?
It seems you have a choice,

138
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,400
either admit
that unscientific polling is bullshit,

139
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,400
or that your views
on women's bodies are horrifying.

140
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,280
I await whatever decision you make
at 3am tonight on Twitter.

141
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,480
And in the meantime,

142
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,080
I would like to leave you all
with the wise words of Alicia Machado.

143
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,200
Advice for the new Miss Universe ?

144
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,480
Good luck. She need it.

145
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,240
Who knew that the advice,
'good luck, you'll need it',

146
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,320
would be equally applicable
to Miss Universe 1997,

147
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,400
and everyone in the most powerful
nation on earth ?

148
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,400
And now this !

149
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,680
And now,
newscasters quoting movies !

150
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,240
It's Bond, James Bond.

151
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,240
You can't handle the truth !

152
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,080
After all,
tomorrow is another day.

153
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,680
To infinity and beyond.

154
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,520
Johnny's here or whatever,
here's Johnny.

155
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,480
Say hello to my little friend.

156
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,920
- Say hello to my little friend.
- Right, just a little bit.

157
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,480
Say hello to my little friend.
Scarface.

158
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,640
Get down, get to the chopper !

159
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,440
I gotta get to the chopper.

160
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,880
I'll be back.

161
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,240
I know it was you Fredo,
you broke my heart. Godfather 2.

162
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,680
Alright, alright, alright.

163
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,240
Alright, alright, alright.

164
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,760
Alright, alright, alright.

165
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,720
Alright, alright, alright.

166
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,400
Show me the money.

167
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,400
Show me the money,
as Cuba Gooding used to say !

168
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,440
Moving on.
Our main story concerns the police.

169
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,160
As these cops show frequently have
to deal with humanity at its worst.

170
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,640
What's the first amendment ?

171
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,320
What's the first amendment ?
You don't even know !

172
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,560
Constitutiooooon !

173
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,000
Yeah. Constitution ! Read it !

174
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,480
And live by it.

175
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,760
Let's have a seat
in the back of the car.

176
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,360
Ron Paul 2012 !

177
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,240
That's perfect. It's not like
he needed to say "Ron Paul 2012".

178
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,680
That was implicit in everything
he said up to that point.

179
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,320
But it's certainly nice
to have it confirmed.

180
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,920
The police have been at the center
of a great deal of controversy.

181
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,640
From the Black Lives Matter movement,
to Colin Kaepernick's protest,

182
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,040
to Mary J. Blige awkwardly singing
a Springsteen song at Hillary Clinton.

183
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,960
Is it a gun,
is it a knife, is it a wallet,

184
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,680
this is your life ?

185
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,920
You can get killed
just for living in

186
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,560
your American skin.

187
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,560
Hillary, thank you !

188
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,760
God !

189
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,280
Hillary would have won
my undying respect

190
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,600
if she'd looked Mary J. Blige
straight in the face and said:

191
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,760
"I support your message,
but that was awkward as fuck".

192
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,120
"And I wish you hadn't done it".
That would've been honest.

193
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,360
The trust between police
and the communities they serve

194
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,080
is clearly a cornerstone
of civilized society.

195
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,480
That trust has been rocked following
controversial police shootings

196
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,000
from Alton Sterling,
to Philando Castile, to Tamir Rice,

197
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,240
to so many others,
I literally cannot mention them all.

198
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,760
These deaths, taken with countless
smaller incidents of police misconduct,

199
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,640
have led to a common refrain.

200
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,160
I just want the police
to be held accountable.

201
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,400
We want the system of policing
to be held accountable.

202
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,480
Those police
need to be held accountable.

203
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,120
Whenever they commit a crime,
whenever something goes wrong,

204
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,560
and I'm talking about serious stuff
like murder and whatnot,

205
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,560
these guys never get prosecuted.

206
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,440
Now those are valid frustrations.
Although, as a side note:

207
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,120
"Murder and Whatnot"
would be an amazing CSI spinoff.

208
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,440
That's a watchable show right there.

209
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,560
Police accountability is what we're
going to be talking about.

210
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,640
I should say,
as the police will tell you,

211
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,000
they have a difficult,
dangerous, challenging job.

212
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,120
No reasonable person
would disagree with that.

213
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,800
That's all the more reason
for ensuring that it's done perfectly.

214
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,280
The worst thing that happens
if a cake decorator fucks up

215
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,320
is you end up wishing someone
a Happy Analversary.

216
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,800
While that's obviously not ideal,
who knows ?

217
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,160
Maybe it's their analversary, too !

218
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,920
The police will argue that what they
have is less an institutional problem,

219
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,880
than it is an individual one.

220
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,200
There's been
some bad apples out there.

221
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,360
I don't think that that is indicative
of the entire police department.

222
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,640
But you got bad apples
in every occupation.

223
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,000
You're gonna have some bad apples.

224
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,480
They're out to protect you
and that's what policing's about.

225
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,120
That is a weirdly blasé attitude.
Bad apples can erode trust fast.

226
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,320
Snow White wasn't afraid of apples

227
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,400
before she took a bite
out of that one really bad one,

228
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,000
but the next time an old lady
comes at her with a piece of fruit,

229
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,360
Snow is gonna
get the fuck out of there.

230
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,800
That argument "it's a few bad apples"
has some real problems.

231
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,800
For a start, it doesn't address
bad laws and policies

232
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,080
that good officers
are made to enforce

233
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,800
which we've touched
on multiple times before.

234
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,920
Criminal justice is kind
of our show's signature bit.

235
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,680
It is to us what assessing
the shape of your poop is to Dr. Oz.

236
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,000
Also, you can't claim
there's just a few bad apples,

237
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,640
when no one knows exactly
how many there are.

238
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,160
There are nearly 18 000
police departments in America,

239
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,280
and they are not great
about reporting or sharing data.

240
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,320
Even some surprisingly
basic questions are hard to answer,

241
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,440
as the head of the FBI admits.

242
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,560
We can't have an informed discussion,
we don't have data.

243
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,320
People have data about who went to
a movie, how many books were sold,

244
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,440
how many cases of the flu
walked into an emergency room.

245
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,840
I cannot tell you how many people
were shot by police in the US

246
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,280
last month, last year,
or anything about the demographics.

247
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,760
How is that possible ? We have
numbers for almost everything !

248
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,240
We have ratings for how many people
watched Jeremy Piven in "Mr. Selfridge"

249
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,240
The government tracks how many
people are killed by falling TVs

250
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,760
a number inflated by people
who were watching "Mr. Selfridge"

251
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,680
and said "I choose death", and then
pulled the TV down on top of them.

252
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:57,200
The best numbers on police misconduct
come from a researcher, Philip Stinson,

253
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,880
who accumulated
over a decade's worth of data

254
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,680
by setting up 48 Google alerts
in 2005.

255
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,160
Google Alerts.
And his stats are truly chilling.

256
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,840
Out of thousands of fatal
police shootings since 2005,

257
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,840
only 77 officers have been charged
with murder or manslaughter.

258
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,440
And to date,
only 26 have been convicted.

259
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,080
And while the truth is,
many police shootings are justified,

260
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,800
26 seems suspiciously low.

261
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,640
So: how can that be the number ?
Well, broadly speaking,

262
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,640
most investigations of police
misconduct face a few obstacles.

263
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,080
And the first one is big: misconduct
is often investigated internally,

264
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,720
by an officer's colleagues,
which does not inspire confidence.

265
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,200
But if you listen to the police chief
in Bakersfield, the system is fine.

266
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,160
You're confident that that structure
of review is entirely impartial ?

267
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,800
I am.
These guys are expert in their field.

268
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,120
They're part of the departments.

269
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,600
They have hundreds of years of law
enforcement experience combined.

270
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,440
Here's the thing there.
Combined experience is not a thing

271
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,080
that automatically
makes you do a better job.

272
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,080
Our staff has a combined
347 years in television

273
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,800
and that doesn't mean we won't
throw a fuckload of raisins on a desk

274
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,520
and call it entertainment.

275
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:24,040
The DOJ has consistently found
flaws with internal investigations.

276
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,520
In Cleveland, investigators admitted
they intentionally cast an officer

277
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,400
in the best light possible when
investigating a use of deadly force.

278
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,600
In Miami, investigations took so long
that "at least two officers"

279
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,360
"killed a suspect while still under
investigation for a previous shooting".

280
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,840
And there should never be
a second one of anything

281
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,000
before you figure out
whether the first was justified.

282
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,280
Call it the "Dolphin Tale 2" rule.
How is there a second one of these ?

283
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,040
I thought Harry Connick Jr. ate the
dolphin at the end of the first one.

284
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,720
I don't know for sure,
I haven't seen it.

285
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,360
But no one has
and that's the point.

286
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,400
In Baltimore, the DOJ report included
the story of Joe Crystal,

287
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,800
a detective who reported two fellow
officers for alleged excessive force,

288
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,320
and was labeled a "rat",

289
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,840
with one colleague leaving pictures
of cheese on his desk,

290
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,280
which is almost charming,

291
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,680
until you learn
how far some others went.

292
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,920
He found himself cut off. He didn't
get backup in dangerous situations.

293
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,080
Someone left a dead rat
on his windshield.

294
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,480
It was like their way of telling me:
you don't belong here...

295
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,120
Leaving a dead rat on an officer's
windshield is hostile.

296
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,920
Unless of course,
that officer is a police cat,

297
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,520
in which case it means:
"Welcome to the force, Whiskers !"

298
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,440
"We're lucky to have you !
Enjoy the rat."

299
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,960
Accountability doesn't just suffer
from an unwritten code of silence.

300
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,200
That code can be enshrined
within state laws or union contracts.

301
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,840
It's hard to spot problem officers
because, in many jurisdictions,

302
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,400
policies allow disciplinary
records to be destroyed.

303
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,120
In Baton Rouge,
a sustained complaint

304
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,840
can be stricken from
your record after just 18 months.

305
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,480
And in Mesa, Arizona, when
a journalist demanded records,

306
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,760
a police chief made an internal video
reminding his officers

307
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,680
that there was a way
for them to clean up their past.

308
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,120
I don't want anybody to relive
a problem they've been disciplined for,

309
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,240
that has already seen the scrutiny
in the public eye.

310
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,600
Purge your files according to policy,

311
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,160
make sure the things you don't
want in there aren't in there.

312
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,760
That seems wrong.

313
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,600
You should not be able to erase parts
of your past that are damning.

314
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,440
This is an official police file,
not a Volkswagen corporate history

315
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,840
that somehow starts
after World War II.

316
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,560
Nazi cars. The choice of the Nazis.

317
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,640
Deleting records is not an officer's
only option to escape their past.

318
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:13,080
After an incident, they'll resign,
and move to another department.

319
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,000
It happens so much, people in law
enforcement call them "gypsy cops".

320
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,320
In South Carolina, a TV station
looked into one officer

321
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,680
who spent a total of nine years
working for nine departments,

322
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,840
three of them in one year, and in one
case, he left in spectacular fashion.

323
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,640
Deputies believed Yarbrough's
driving was "compromised"

324
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,960
and they discovered a half-empty
"bottle of rye whiskey"

325
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,080
and a baggie of "assorted pills"
in his patrol cruiser.

326
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:45,760
Yarbrough said: "I'm not taking
no drug test, I guess I'll resign."

327
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,400
Holy shit. "I'm not taking no
drug test, I guess I'll resign"

328
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,640
is a sentence you do not want
to hear from a police officer.

329
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,960
It's barely appropriate from
a roadie leaving Aerosmith.

330
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,080
"Gypsy cops" have been involved
in tragic incidents.

331
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,560
In the Tamir Rice case, the officer
who shot the 12-year-old

332
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,600
had been in the process
of being fired, before resigning.

333
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,680
But, the Cleveland police missed
that red flag when hiring him,

334
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,000
they didn't read
his personnel file,

335
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,160
an incident
during weapons training

336
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,160
where he had a loss of composure,
leading his supervisor to conclude:

337
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,520
"I do not believe time, nor training,
will change or correct deficiencies."

338
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,760
That performance review should keep
you from getting hired at Staples,

339
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,720
let alone a job
where you're given a gun.

340
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,680
That cop was never even charged.
Like many such cases,

341
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,080
his never made it past
the grand jury.

342
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,320
Which seems inherently surprising,
until you realize:

343
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:54,040
local prosecutors and cops have to work
together, which can get complicated.

344
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,960
As a former prosecutor,
you rely upon the police.

345
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,800
You trust the police. The police
are in your office examining evidence,

346
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,200
preparing for trial.

347
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,920
And then have to turn around and
prosecute them to prosecute you.

348
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,160
Exactly. For a prosecutor to go
after a cop they work with is awkward.

349
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,360
I can't think of anything more
awkward, other than this:

350
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,920
Hillary, thank you.

351
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,080
God, it's not getting any better.
Nothing in Hillary's life

352
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,240
has ever been
more awkward than that.

353
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,040
Think about
what a high bar that is.

354
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,240
Even when cases go to trial,
officers have a major advantage,

355
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,120
juries tend to have a natural
predisposition to trust them.

356
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,400
Police officers get a presumption
of innocence

357
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,920
whereas most criminal defendants don't
come in with presumption of innocence.

358
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,840
A judge will toss the case
at a preliminary hearing

359
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,680
or a grand jury will refuse to indict,
so you never even get to trial.

360
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,640
Jurors do not come in
with any belief

361
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,280
that officers can commit a crime.

362
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,360
Many people see a police uniform
and think "trustworthy".

363
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,720
Unless it includes a sleeveless shirt
and a boom-box,

364
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,960
in which case
they think "stripper".

365
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,080
And sometimes: "Wait... Jim ?
From middle school ?!"

366
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:30,640
The police have a certain amount of
leeway regarding lethal force,

367
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,800
meaning that "fatal shootings
can be considered legal"

368
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,800
"even if they are
unnecessary or disproportional."

369
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,360
There is even a shorthand
for such cases, lawful but awful.

370
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,080
Which is also the legal
definition of Woody Allen's marriage.

371
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,440
I think that's it.
Who are you angry with here ?

372
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,200
Put the boos
back in your pocket.

373
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,280
Officers can bring in expert witnesses

374
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,720
who can present nearly any situation
as a potential threat.

375
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,280
Dr. Bill Lewinski runs
the Force Science Institute.

376
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,680
For years, he has testified
on behalf of police officers.

377
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,160
Here is why it may be okay
to shoot someone that has a knife.

378
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,080
Knives can be more dangerous.

379
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,560
They don't have to be reloaded.
Can be used at close distance.

380
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:26,320
A stab or a cut
can be extremely quick.

381
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,040
That is not the motion you make
when you are stabbing someone.

382
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,840
It's the motion you make when you are
a teenage magician finishing a trick.

383
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,480
Is this your card ?

384
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,520
There is no doubt, a knife
is a dangerous weapon.

385
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,080
What if someone
doesn't have a knife ?

386
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,240
Could force still be necessary
when someone is unarmed ?

387
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,920
It's significant to know

388
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,120
that unarmed does not mean
they're not dangerous.

389
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:01,040
The fist may have been first weapon
human beings used against each other.

390
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,560
I've measured strikes on human,
and the strikes can occur

391
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,040
at a speed of 4, 5, or 6 strikes
in a second, some really hard.

392
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,360
What is he talking about ?
The only time a fist

393
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,960
is a match for a weapon is during
a game of rock paper scissors.

394
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:26,280
It can be defeated by paper,
for reasons which make no sense.

395
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,320
But that's not the point.

396
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,360
Defendants are allowed
to call expert witnesses.

397
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,520
Weird is, Lewinski has appeared
before grand juries,

398
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,880
where prosecutors are supposed
to present their best case

399
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,720
for an officer's indictment.

400
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,080
Why would they let
Lewinski in there ?

401
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,040
They're shooting
their own case in the foot.

402
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,120
Presumably justified, because feet
were the second weapon ever invented.

403
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,320
We've focused heavily on trials,
but in a perfect world,

404
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,120
there would be enough
police accountability

405
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,000
that the blunt instrument of a trial
would very rarely be necessary.

406
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,880
How can we fix all this ?

407
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,800
Body cameras have increased
transparency and trust.

408
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,720
In Rialto, Calfornia,
after one year of using them,

409
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,640
the number of complaints filed
against officers fell by 88 percent,

410
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,840
and the use of force dropped
by around 60 percent.

411
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,400
When Baltimore's trial run of a body
camera program ended,

412
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,040
their commissioner
begged for their return.

413
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,880
Officers want cameras. This is
a moment everybody wants cameras.

414
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,480
I was speaking to some folks
and we had a couple police officers

415
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,280
who were turning in their body cameras

416
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,120
and were asking
"when can we get these back ?"

417
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,840
Right, and these cops
aren't M. Night Shyamalan.

418
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,440
If they plead to let them have
a camera, you should give it to them.

419
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,560
Give it to them !

420
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,840
Body cameras are one solution.
Other cities tried requiring officers

421
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,200
to file separate reports every time
there's a use of force,

422
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,360
or they've used early intervention
systems to spot problem officers,

423
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,400
or they brought in outside prosecutors
to handle controversial cases.

424
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,040
Police unions fiercely fight
any attempted reforms.

425
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,360
Just listen to James Stewart, head
of the biggest police union in Newark,

426
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,320
where the DOJ found three-quarters
of stops had no legal justification.

427
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,960
To listen to him,
the police are being too scrutinized.

428
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,640
I don't know
where the problem started,

429
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,480
but there is an animosity
or a lack of trust.

430
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,080
As soon as there's physical force
exerted by a police officer,

431
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,160
everybody's got cellphones out
to catch us doing wrong.

432
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,640
When you got the cop in the street
facing this negative opposition,

433
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,400
does there come a point when
the police officer's going to say:

434
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,600
"Maybe he doesn't have to go to jail.
I'll take a path of least resistance."

435
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,960
"I'll put the blinders on at the corner
where the 10 guys are hanging out."

436
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,480
There is a lot to unpack there:
first, threatening not to do your job

437
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,520
because you've faced
public criticism is childish.

438
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,560
You think Steven Seagal
gave up on his movie career

439
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,680
because people said mean things ?

440
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,960
Of course not ! Just this year,
he starred in End of a Gun,

441
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,560
The Perfect Weapon,
The Asian Connection,

442
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,600
Code of Honor
and Sniper: Special Ops. Why ?

443
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,240
Because he's a fucking professional !
And he commits to his job.

444
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,360
More importantly:
when you say you might ignore

445
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,680
ten people hanging out on a corner,
yeah, maybe do that !

446
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,280
That's not typically a crime.

447
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,880
In some cases, ten people on a corner
is just a fucking yard sale.

448
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,400
For many people, Stewart's argument
that for police to be effective,

449
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,280
they need to be given broad leeway
to use force, is very appealing.

450
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,600
It's especially appealing for those
of us who, for whatever reason,

451
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,880
are confident that that force
won't be applied to them.

452
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,600
But it is worth looking at
the actual cost of that tradeoff.

453
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,440
Lack of trust in police accountability
leads to a lack of trust in police.

454
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,800
We have reached the point
where there are schools

455
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,960
who teach kids how to safely
interact with law enforcement.

456
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,920
I want you to repeat after me.
I want you to say: "Officer !"

457
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,080
"Am I free to go ?"

458
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,200
One more time ! "Officer."
Am I free to go ?"

459
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,920
The hope is, with this advice,

460
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,880
teens can protect their rights
and maybe their lives.

461
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,960
That is so depressing.
Especially when you realize

462
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,040
that's the only class where
nobody will raise their hand

463
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,600
and say: "When are we
ever going to use this ?"

464
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,520
When you see something
like that, it makes it hard to buy in

465
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,600
when someone dismisses police
misconduct issues.

466
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,600
They're out to protect you.
Are there bad apples ? Yeah !

467
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,000
Yeah but here's the thing
about that:

468
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,000
the phrase isn't, "it's just a few bad
apples, don't worry about it."

469
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,360
The phrase is: "a few bad
apples spoil the barrel."

470
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,280
We currently have a system,
which is set up to ignore bad apples,

471
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,160
destroy bad apples' records,
persecute good apples for speaking up

472
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,600
and shuffle dangerous,
emotionally unstable apples around

473
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,680
to the point that children have
to attend apple classes.

474
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,760
You cannot look at our situation
and claim anybody likes them apples.

475
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,600
And now this.

476
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,400
And now, newscasters quoting movies,
all Chris Matthews edition.

477
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,240
We have here
a failure to communicate.

478
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,720
I'm mad and I'm not
gonna take it anymore.

479
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,360
Of all the gin joints in all the towns,
she walks into mine.

480
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,160
Houston, we have a problem.

481
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,560
I wish I knew how to quit you.
Make my day. Lieutenant Dan.

482
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,160
My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed
my father, prepare to die.

483
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,040
Robert DeNiro played him
when... You talking to me ?

484
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,000
Robert DeNiro, you talking to me ?
You talking to me ?

485
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,640
You talking to me ?

486
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,040
They can't handle the truth.
Remember ?

487
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:13,480
We don't need no badges,
like in the movie.

488
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,400
William Wallace in the movie,

489
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,080
some think we've never
had a country of our own.

490
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,680
That whole idea,
if we have our own country.

491
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,840
Don't know if the accent
was right...

492
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,200
And finally tonight, a quick
update about Wells Fargo.

493
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,040
The bank that, until recently,
was laughing all the way to itself.

494
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,880
Now, last week, we covered
the revelation their employees

495
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,240
had created millions of fake
accounts in customers' names.

496
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,040
We got more details on why it
may've gone on for quite so long.

497
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,120
Allegations
that Wells Fargo retaliated

498
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,000
against employees
who called an ethics hotline.

499
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,560
Many workers called that line
because they felt pressured

500
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,520
to open phony accounts
to meet unreasonable quotas.

501
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,120
It's true. Wells Fargo is accused
of retaliating against whistleblowers

502
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,880
who called their ethics line.

503
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,120
Although it was probably a dead
giveaway that the number

504
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,440
was 1-800-snitches-get-stitches.

505
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,960
And their bad week
didn't stop there.

506
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,600
Wells Fargo's CEO, John Stumpf,
had to appear in front of lawmakers,

507
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,080
still with a brace on his hand,
which I legally cannot say

508
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,640
was from a wrist sprain suffered
while jamming stolen money up his ass.

509
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,840
That's why I wouldn't say that.

510
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,720
Stumpf forfeited $41 million
of his pay this week,

511
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,360
but he is still somehow holding
onto his job.

512
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,320
Which is especially galling,
considering it also emerged this week

513
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,440
that Wells Fargo paid $24 million
to settle an entirely different case.

514
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,920
The department of justice
has charged Wells Fargo,

515
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,160
illegally repossessing 413 vehicles
owned by members of the military.

516
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,000
That is no way
to treat members of the military.

517
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,640
Thank you for your service.
While we're at it,

518
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,520
your Honda Civic,
thank you very much.

519
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,520
And this pattern of behavior
is hard to take,

520
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,920
coming from a bank who,
just ten years ago,

521
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,160
were producing actual ethics videos
for their employees to watch.

522
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,800
This is an uncomfortable subject.
But let's face it:

523
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,160
we're in the business
of trust and money.

524
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,680
While we pride
on our high level of honesty,

525
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,680
even we are not immune
from the occasional bad apple.

526
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,480
I'm talking about internal fraud.
Consequences are swift and severe.

527
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,320
Jobs are lost,
family and friends embarrassed.

528
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,680
There's the possibility
of going to jail

529
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,440
and the obligation to repay
every penny back.

530
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,800
Ethics rules aren't
meant to be stretched. If they are...

531
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,040
They inevitably
come back to bite you.

532
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,360
Cool.

533
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:54,400
Wells Fargo is almost begging
employees not to take him seriously,

534
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,800
nothing says a commitment
to ethics like a mixed metaphor

535
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,200
being delivered through
bad prop comedy

536
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,040
by a man in a shirt
the color of mustard.

537
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,440
We tracked that guy down.
Which wasn't difficult to do.

538
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,280
Because, and you are
not going to believe this,

539
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,640
he's one of the writers
on our show now.

540
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,440
It's true.

541
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,440
Ten years ago, he used to do
internal company videos.

542
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,760
While he's left all that behind,
guess what, Wells Fargo ?

543
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:31,840
He's agreed to do one more video,
this time, just for you.

544
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,000
This is an uncomfortable subject,
but remember me, Wells Fargo ?

545
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,720
I'm your fraud guy ! From the video
that, judging by your behavior,

546
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,560
none of you assholes watched.

547
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,160
I'm sure you've noticed,
I did steal this suit from wardrobe.

548
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,400
Criticize me for taking
what didn't belong to me.

549
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,840
I dare you.
I fucking dare you.

550
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,080
There were things
I didn't mention in that video,

551
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,080
I thought
they went without saying.

552
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,600
Don't set crazy goals that encourage
your staff to open fake accounts.

553
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,520
Don't punish whistleblowers.

554
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,200
Don't illegally repossess soldiers'
cars when on active duty.

555
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,360
Come on Wells Fargo. These are basic
lessons for being a human being.

556
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,920
Get your shit together.
I'll tell you why.

557
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,040
It turns out, ethics violations
aren't actually like a rubber band.

558
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,920
They're more like a dildo
attached to a boomerang.

559
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,040
Because they will come back
and they will fuck you.

560
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,800
That's our show !
See you next week ! Good night !

561
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,880
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
