LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,760
SEASON III
EPISODE 13

3
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,840
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,120
Thank you so much for joining us.
Time for a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,200
And we begin in Venezuela.
AKA North South America.

6
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,720
They have been in an economic crisis,
and things have escalated sharply.

7
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,960
It's been 12 straight days
of violent clashes here in Venezuela.

8
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,200
On one side,
students and the middle class.

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,000
On the other,
police and pro-government groups.

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,480
Twelve days of violent clashes.

11
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,280
That is a terrible situation,
and an even worse Christmas carol.

12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,520
What is wrong with Venezuela ?

13
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,640
The short answer is, everything.

14
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,840
The low price of oil, which accounts
for 96 percent of Venezuela's exports,

15
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,520
has triggered an economic collapse,
causing shortages of food and medicine.

16
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,000
And their president, Nicolas Maduro,
is not handling it at all well.

17
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,760
He suggested punishing business
owners who've ceased operations

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,360
by jailing them
and seizing their factories.

19
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,520
An idle factory will be a factory
handed over to the people !

20
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,400
But we're going to do it, fuck it !
The time has come to do it !

21
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,200
Wait ! No good, well-thought-out
government action

22
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,480
has ever included
the words 'fuck it' !

23
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,240
Lincoln did not abolish slavery
by saying:

24
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,840
"Fuck it ! You're free ! Fuck it.
What are they gonna do ? Fuck it."

25
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,640
And one of Maduro's plans to cope
with electricity shortages isn't better.

26
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,520
President Nicolas Maduro
asked women to stop drying their hair.

27
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,720
I always think a woman looks better

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,840
when she runs her fingers through
her hair and lets it dry naturally.

29
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,080
It's just an idea I have.

30
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,000
What ?
"It's just an idea you have" ?

31
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,240
Un-have it then,
because that is next level creepy.

32
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,600
He saved energy
through millions of Venezuelans

33
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,600
immediately turning off their TVs,
saying, "This stays off forever.

34
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,440
I cannot risk hearing that man talk
about women's grooming again."

35
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,120
It's no wonder that in a recent poll
70 percent of Venezuelans

36
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,680
are in favor
of Maduro's removal from power.

37
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,320
Which is what makes what he did
this week especially troubling.

38
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,360
I have called
for the armed forces and militia

39
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,720
to hold military exercises
to prepare us for any scenario.

40
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,360
His citizens are starving, and Maduro
decided it would be a great time

41
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,440
to spend money on the biggest military
exercise in Venezuelan history,

42
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,160
which is bound
to inflame tensions even more.

43
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,720
So it seems to me Maduro
has got two choices:

44
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,160
either step down
and make his people happy,

45
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,240
or at the very least, make sure those
tanks are firing loaves of bread.

46
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,840
It might seem stupid,
but it's just an idea I have.

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,720
So, let's move on now,
let's move on to Canada.

48
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,280
What you'd get if US and Britain had
a baby they abandoned in the snow.

49
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,680
Prime minister Justin Trudeau

50
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,920
has been enjoying a bit of a honeymoon
since assuming office six months ago,

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,200
with most news coverage focusing on
events like that time he held 2 pandas.

52
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,680
Which is pretty cute.

53
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,560
It's no the Rock holding two
French bulldogs in a swimming pool.

54
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,240
But it's close, it's close.

55
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,240
But this week, Trudeau's grace period
came to a screeching halt,

56
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,560
as Canada
was consumed by "Elbowgate",

57
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,480
a scandal concerning Trudeau
"manhandling" a Canadian MP

58
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,320
and elbowing another during an
altercation in the house of commons.

59
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,080
So, so what happened exactly ?

60
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,080
Now watch this, the man in the front
is the conservative whip,

61
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,880
he can't by a group of NDP MPs,
including leader Tom Mulcair.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,920
On the left, the prime minster
comes striding over to intervene,

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,720
he has words with Mulcair.

64
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,240
At the same time he clearly also makes
contact with MP Ruth Ellen Brosseau.

65
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,600
I guess that's a brawl
by Canadian standards.

66
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,760
Although to be honest in New York,
we call that shopping at Trader Joe's.

67
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,760
But still, Trudeau absolutely
should not have done that.

68
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,080
He clearly knew it, given how quickly
he took to the floor to apologize.

69
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,480
I admit I came in physical contact
with a number of members

70
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,000
as I extended my arm in,

71
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,600
including someone behind me
who I did not see.

72
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,720
If anyone feels that they were
impacted by my actions

73
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,360
I completely apologize,

74
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,480
it is not my intention
to hurt anyone,

75
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,600
it certainly wasn't, it is
my intention to get this vote done.

76
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,440
Stammering out an apology that goes
on to receive a standing ovation.

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,560
That clip may as well just be
the new Canadian national anthem.

78
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,680
But the members of the opposition were
not ready to accept Trudeau's apology.

79
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,240
I will move that the matter
of the physical molestation

80
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,080
be referred to the standing committee
and house affairs.

81
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,240
Come on, don't use that word.

82
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,840
There is a definition of "molest"

83
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,680
that means
"to bother, interfere with, annoy,"

84
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,520
but it's the second most unpleasant
"m" word in the English language

85
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,960
after "moist."

86
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,400
I said it ! I'd wash my mouth out with
soap but that would make it all moist.

87
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,280
No, I said it again !

88
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,760
That outrage led Trudeau to issue
a second apology on the house floor,

89
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,240
followed by a third apology at an
event celebrating the official apology

90
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,440
he'd made for the 1914
Komagata Maaru incident,

91
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,200
at which he, and this is true,

92
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,200
apologized because his elbowing
might take away a little bit in the news

93
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,360
from the apology that he
was supposed to be celebrating.

94
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,840
And when he returned
to the House of Commons,

95
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,800
you'll never guess what he did.

96
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,880
I am apologizing
and asking for members

97
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,760
to understand how contrite and how
regretful I am with my behavior.

98
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,520
For fuck's sake, enough !

99
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,640
There may be no clearer difference
between the United States and Canada

100
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,280
than the fact that in the US,

101
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,640
presidential candidates write books
called "No Apology", while in Canada,

102
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,920
Trudeau may be expected
to spend the remainder of his term

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,440
apologizing for the existence
of his arm wherever he goes.

104
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,280
And now this.

105
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,120
And now, John McLaughlin
angrily introduces discussion topics.

106
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:09,760
Issue one, two islands,
28 pages and one king.

107
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,480
Issue two, Chinese bridges.

108
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,040
Issue three, Michelle in Qatar.

109
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,600
Secrets away.

110
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,520
Civil furor.

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,720
Meet me in Singapore.

112
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,440
A problem of poop.

113
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,960
Hujambo Obama !

114
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,680
Wildlife woe.

115
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,320
Give me my money !

116
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,560
Bye bye Syria ?

117
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,840
Speaker who ?

118
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,720
Lifeboat for Lula ?

119
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,120
Barack back Biden ?

120
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,000
Message in a tank.

121
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,120
Cyber-kleptos.

122
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,040
I'm here to stay.

123
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,440
Bye bye !

124
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,440
Moving on.

125
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,880
Our main story this week concerns
presidential primaries and caucuses.

126
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,160
The electoral foreplay
which will culminate

127
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,960
in the mass balloon ejaculations
of this summer's conventions.

128
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,200
Both parties nearly have their nominee,
and it looks like America

129
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,760
will be choosing between Donald Trump,
America's walking, talking brush fire,

130
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,440
and Hillary Clinton, the woman
who exhibits either too much

131
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,040
or too little of every human quality,
depending on who you ask.

132
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,080
Which is not to say that the
democrats' primary process is over

133
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,680
as we saw in Nevada last weekend,
it is very much still raging.

134
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,920
This is ridiculous. This whole
process has been screwed up.

135
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,000
Emotions ran high at the democratic
state convention in Las Vegas

136
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,680
after Clinton took more delegate wins
than Bernie Sanders.

137
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,320
Holy shit. Usually when
a crowd is that angry in Vegas,

138
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,280
it's because they realized there are
no elephants in Cirque du Soleil,

139
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,040
just a bunch
of terrifying nightmare perverts.

140
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,400
But not just Nevada caused frustration
over how delegates are assigned.

141
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,560
Thanks to an odd quirk
in the democrats' system,

142
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,920
there have been news reports
like this...

143
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,840
We're putting up a graphic.

144
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,240
Bernie Sanders
wins 56 to 44 percent in Wyoming.

145
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,600
The delegates rewarded:
Hillary Clinton, 11, Bernie Sanders, 7.

146
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,920
Why does the Democratic Party
even have voting booths ?

147
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,320
- Why ?
- This system is so rigged.

148
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,520
We have voting booths

149
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,880
for the same reason
that Friendly's has restaurant booths.

150
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,920
So that we can have privacy while we
choose from an unappetizing menu.

151
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,440
And it is not just the democrats.
When Donald Trump won Louisiana,

152
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,080
beating Ted Cruz by more than
3 percent, he was upset to discover

153
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,480
that Cruz could potentially get
as many as ten more delegates.

154
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,680
Or, as he put it...

155
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,920
I end up winning Louisiana
and then when everything is done,

156
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,760
I find out I get less delegates than
this guy that got his ass kicked ?

157
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,080
Give me a break.

158
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,280
The thing is,
I get why he's annoyed.

159
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,000
And there is no clearer piece of
evidence that our system is broken

160
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,680
no more thoroughly dead canary
in the coalmine

161
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,640
than when Donald Trump
is actually making sense.

162
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,520
Because when you see results like that
the process does feel counterintuitive.

163
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,480
So we thought we'd ask:
why do the parties operate this way ?

164
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,280
For many years, they didn't.

165
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,560
Until 50 years ago,
most states didn't have primaries,

166
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,200
and candidates were chosen
by party insiders at the convention.

167
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,320
But in 1968, that system broke down,
when the Democratic Party leadership

168
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,520
picked Hubert Humphrey, despite the
fact he hadn't competed in a primary.

169
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,160
Democrats were pissed off.
And the convention was chaos.

170
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,040
A lot of pushing. A man being pushed,
they're gonna knock that over.

171
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,840
The man is a delegate.
They're asking for silence.

172
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,880
There's a priest in here,
dozens of reporters,

173
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,520
and the man who got involved in it all
is very calmly smoking a cigarette.

174
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,280
He's not just smoking any cigarette,
he's smoking a Chesterfield.

175
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,560
"Once you've turned democracy into
a riot, you deserve a Chesterfield."

176
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,160
In the years that followed,
both parties reformed their processes

177
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,960
to give their rank-and-file members
more of a say.

178
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,040
But many of the details
were left up to state leaders.

179
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,000
Which might help explain why we have
an erratic clusterfuck every 4 years.

180
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,880
Almost every part of this process
is difficult to defend.

181
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,600
While most states hold primaries,
in all of these states,

182
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,200
one or both parties hold caucuses.

183
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,520
Which is a process whereby you
typically have to turn up

184
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,400
to a certain place at a certain time,
like a school gymnasium at 7 pm,

185
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,720
attend a party meeting
that can take hours, and then vote.

186
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,920
If you work at night,
or you can't get a babysitter,

187
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,160
or you don't have transportation,
you can be frozen out.

188
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,320
That is probably why while republican
primary turnout in 2012 was 19 percent,

189
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,000
their turnout for caucuses
averaged just 3 percent.

190
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,160
Which is terrible. If you have
three percent turnout at an orgy,

191
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,920
it's basically just you masturbating
next to a table of uneaten snacks.

192
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,840
So generally you are lucky if you
live in a state that has a primary.

193
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,040
Unless you're a democrat
in Washington State,

194
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,600
where things
get a little more complicated.

195
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,240
In Washington State,
we have both caucuses.

196
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,120
Can anybody else
speak up on their candidate ?

197
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,760
And presidential primaries,
where you cast a ballot in private.

198
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,960
But democrats
ignored the primary from day one.

199
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,720
It's true. The democrats' presidential
primary in Washington doesn't count.

200
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,920
They have one,
and it's this Tuesday,

201
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,960
but all the pledged delegates were
decided at their caucus, months ago.

202
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,600
You know your awful friend

203
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,640
who says he doesn't vote because he
"doesn't feel like his vote counts" ?

204
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,360
If he's a Washington democrat
participating in the primary,

205
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,120
he's still awful, but he is right.

206
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,240
And then there's the problem
of how the delegates get divided up

207
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,520
which is key, because you're not
directly voting for a candidate.

208
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,080
You're voting to help
determine the delegates

209
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,640
who'll attend
the national party convention

210
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,920
and vote for a candidate
on your behalf.

211
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,680
And some states have
even more steps in between.

212
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,960
Just look at what led up
to last weekend's events in Nevada.

213
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,480
They had a caucus back in February.
Which Hillary Clinton won.

214
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,480
But that caucus only determined 23
out of their 35 regular delegates.

215
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,680
As for the remaining 12, were decided
by delegates at the state convention,

216
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,360
who were chosen by the delegates
at county conventions in April,

217
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,440
who were chosen in those February
caucuses, which remember Hillary won.

218
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,840
At those county conventions,
more Bernie supporters showed up,

219
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,040
so they had an advantage going
into the state convention.

220
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,520
By that time, Hillary supporters
had managed to mobilize their turnout,

221
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,120
putting numbers
in that room basically even.

222
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,000
Both sides began fighting
to disqualify one another's delegates,

223
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,400
over technicalities such as "failing to
register as democrats by May the 1st",

224
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,000
a deadline set after it had
already passed, at the convention,

225
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,840
by the credentials committee.

226
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,520
At this point, whoever you support,
you probably feel like this !

227
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,880
Exactly. I just don't know
if there's a better summation

228
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,040
of this primary process so far
than that sound.

229
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,800
Politifact looked into the charges
of "rigging" in Nevada

230
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,720
and found no clear evidence the
state party "hijacked" the process.

231
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,480
You can disagree with that
as Bernie supporters will

232
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,920
in the comments section
below this video,

233
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,200
alongside hurtful remarks about
my appearance.

234
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,640
Like: "Look !
It's British Millhouse."

235
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,960
Or "he looks like someone who
says: "My parents are my best friends"

236
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,560
but who's also an orphan."

237
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,200
Or "did someone just Benjamin-Button
Henry Kissinger ?"

238
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,440
All of which statements
Politifact also rates as true.

239
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,920
But the larger point Politifact
made regarding Nevada, is:

240
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,800
"the arcane party structures"

241
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,920
"don't reflect how most people
assume presidential selection works."

242
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,480
And that in itself
is a huge problem.

243
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,320
Any competition
should have clear rules.

244
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,680
You don't get to the end
of a football game:

245
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,280
"Okay: who found the most eggs ?"

246
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,120
Wait. What ? That's what
we were supposed to be doing ?

247
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,720
Why didn't someone tell me that
at the start ? I only have 5 eggs.

248
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,360
This patchwork of convoluted systems
would be annoying enough.

249
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,440
Each party also has its own way
of putting its thumb on the scale.

250
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,960
For democrats,
it's "superdelegates".

251
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,440
15 percent of the total delegates

252
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,800
to this summer's democratic
convention are unpledged.

253
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,920
These are elected officials,
former presidents,

254
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,040
and assorted party bigwigs
called superdelegates.

255
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,240
They can vote for
whichever candidate they want,

256
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,040
regardless of who won
in their state or district.

257
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,240
The delegates are "super"

258
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,600
in the way the kids
on "My Super Sweet 16" are super:

259
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,280
party-obsessed, widely resented,
untethered from all responsibility.

260
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,200
The theory behind was
that the party leaders could step in

261
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,600
if they didn't like
the way things were heading.

262
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,680
Whenever Debbie Wasserman Schultz,
chair of DNC, is asked about them,

263
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,720
she insists that superdelegates
would never do that:

264
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,160
We have party activists,
elected officials

265
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,600
and other leaders
that are a part of our process.

266
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,200
Never determined
the outcome of our nominee.

267
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,960
If they're not going to make
a difference, why having them at all ?

268
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,800
You're keeping rat poison in a jar
next to the sugar, saying:

269
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,880
"It hasn't been a problem yet !"
That might technically be true,

270
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,880
but is this really the best
system you can think of ?

271
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:03,520
Republicans have their way of diluting
the power of primary votes.

272
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,760
Delegates are required to reflect
the state's choice in the first round.

273
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,000
After that, they become "unbound
delegates" and can vote for whomever.

274
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,840
Pennsylvania takes
this even further:

275
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:23,080
out of their 71 delegates, 54 are
unbound, even on the first ballot.

276
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,720
While these delegates
are elected by voters,

277
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,640
those voters may not know
what they're voting for.

278
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,040
If you're a GOP voter
you may well know

279
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,000
which candidate you are choosing
when you step into the voting booth.

280
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,960
When it comes to choosing delegates
to the presidential convention,

281
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:45,040
there's no way for you to know which
ones support which candidates

282
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,720
because it's simply not listed.

283
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,440
Like you vote, but who are
you voting for ? You have no idea.

284
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,280
That makes no fucking sense.

285
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,200
If "Dancing with the Stars"
had a system where,

286
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,560
instead of voting directly for
Paige Vanzant or Ginger Zee,

287
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:09,520
you had to vote for Doug or Karen
to vote on your behalf,

288
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,840
there would be riots in the streets.

289
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,840
This year, North Dakota
republicans just said fuck it,

290
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,280
and had neither
a caucus nor a primary.

291
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,240
The party just chose
28 delegates themselves.

292
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,720
And in explaining
why primaries aren't that important,

293
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,840
one of those delegates
gave the whole game away.

294
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,000
In previous years, we've
used primaries to privately give us

295
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,280
an indication of the preference
of the popular election,

296
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,280
but the delegates choose the nominee,
not the voters in the primaries.

297
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,680
He's treating the more than 27 million
people who've voted so far

298
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,680
like a parent treats a kid
with a toy lawnmower.

299
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,680
"Great job, Billy !
You did it all on your own !"

300
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,640
"Now, step aside,
Daddy's coming through."

301
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,320
To be fair to both parties,
they're basically private clubs.

302
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,200
They could give the nomination to
whichever comes first alphabetically,

303
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,400
or whichever one can squeeze a frog
the hardest without crushing it.

304
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:20,240
But, if you play by a system
of complex, opaque rules

305
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,560
and that you could use to
your advantage, even if you don't,

306
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,640
you are going to alienate voters.

307
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,480
This is a system which clearly
needs wholesale reform.

308
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,480
Once the system produces a winner,
the conversation tends to move on.

309
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,920
And if you need any more proof of
that, just listen to Trump this month.

310
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,920
I said it's a rigged system.

311
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,400
But now I don't say it anymore
because I won, okay. It's true.

312
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,840
Now I don't care.

313
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,920
It's clear, nobody wants to change
the weird rules if they win.

314
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,640
The producers of "The Martian"
are complaining about the rules

315
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,480
by which the Golden Globes gave them
"Best picture, comedy or musical" ?

316
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,000
No ! They're just busy writing another
movie as sidesplittingly hilarious

317
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,040
as Matt Damon potato-farming
in space for two hours.

318
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,080
It would clearly behoove both parties
to take a long, hard look at this

319
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,320
because they got lucky this time.

320
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,320
Whether you like these
two candidates or not,

321
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,320
the party nominees will coincidentally
be the people with the most votes.

322
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,840
Trump currently has a lead of nearly
4 million over his closest competitor

323
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,640
and Hillary leads Sanders
by over three million.

324
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,480
Sanders supporters might argue that
doesn't include caucus votes.

325
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,640
Washington Post
estimated the rest,

326
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,320
they found that she would still lead
by 2.9 million votes.

327
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,080
Even if you multiply all those
estimated caucus votes by seven,

328
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,720
even if you give Bernie a bonus of ten
thousand extra votes in every state,

329
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,720
even if you tack on an extra
hundred thousand votes

330
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,160
just for shits and giggles,
she's still comfortably ahead.

331
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,680
I know Bernie supporters,
I can hear you typing right now...

332
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,800
I can hear you typing that I look like
an angry toucan funded by Shillary,

333
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,400
but that doesn't make that
any less true.

334
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,040
There's no guarantee that

335
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,400
the candidate with the most votes
will win next time.

336
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,680
And if they don't,

337
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,040
all the flaws we just documented
will be exposed yet again.

338
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:29,240
We get angry about the primary process
during the primary process,

339
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,000
when it's impacting
the candidate we care about.

340
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,520
But the middle of the game is the
worst time to change the rules.

341
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,160
If everyone is as angry as
they say they are right now,

342
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:45,960
let's together, pick a date to write
an email to the chair of each party,

343
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,720
and remind them,
politely, to fix this.

344
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,880
I propose February 2nd.

345
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,320
That will be easy to remember,
because it's Groundhog Day.

346
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,240
Which does seem appropriate.

347
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,160
Unless this primary
process is fixed,

348
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,840
we are all destined to live through the
same nightmare scenario

349
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,720
over and over again until
the end of fucking time.

350
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,800
And now, this...

351
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,240
Increasingly weird bell ringers
at the New York Stock Exchange.

352
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,880
Meatloaf.

353
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,000
Westminster Dog Show Winner
Foxcliffe Hickory Wind.

354
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,120
Hello Kitty. Darth Vader.

355
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,560
Miss Piggy.
Rafiki from the Lion King.

356
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,000
Two minions.

357
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,680
Three Smurfs.

358
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,120
And convicted sex offender,
Jared Fogle.

359
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,680
Now, finally, before we go this week,
a quick word regarding Chechnya.

360
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,680
The place that, when it shows up
at the beginning of an action movie,

361
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,240
promises you some shit
is about to go down.

362
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,240
Their leader is Ramzan Kadyrov,

363
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,400
pictured here in a t-shirt that says
"2 psycho" on it.

364
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,160
Which is completely appropriate, for
reasons that you will soon understand.

365
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,000
Kadyrov is recognized
as a brutal and corrupt strongman.

366
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,880
This week he was
in the news for a different reason.

367
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,280
Ramzan Kadyrov lost this cat.

368
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,640
The leader of Chechnya
addressed his Instagram followers

369
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,840
and asked them to help him search
for the Bengal, the breed of the pet.

370
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,400
So if you are living in the republic
and saw a similar animal,

371
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,200
now's the time to contact
the head of your region.

372
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,520
Yes, the entire Chechen republic

373
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,440
was put on notice this week because
its leader couldn't find his cat.

374
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,800
I'm presuming he searched
most common locations,

375
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,480
such as lying in a sunbeam,

376
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,320
or staring right at you
with murder in its eyes.

377
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,800
But Kadyrov's family
didn't just lose their cat.

378
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,480
As he put it on Instagram:
"We have completely lost our cat".

379
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,320
They haven't just lost
a couple paws and a tail,

380
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,320
they lost the whole thing.

381
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,760
Kadyrov being upset
about his lost cat is not good.

382
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,040
This is a man whose security forces
have been accused of kidnappings,

383
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,960
and whose Wikipedia page
has an entire section

384
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,200
dedicated to
"accusations of human rights abuses".

385
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,320
And the mere existence
of that is pretty damning.

386
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,280
It's like having a subsection for
"1997 Forklift DUI"

387
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,080
or "Aftermath of Howard University
Commencement Speech".

388
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,480
You don't need to know the details
to know that it cannot be good.

389
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,560
To get a sense of Kadyrov,
check his Instagram page.

390
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,840
It's not just where he
announced that he'd lost his cat.

391
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,280
It's also where he keeps his
1.8 million followers updated

392
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:49,160
with videos of his workout routine,
set to the finest European rave music.

393
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,720
Cool.

394
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,960
Kadyrov's basically like a can of
Monster energy drink come to life.

395
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,320
I cannot recommend
his Instagram feed enough.

396
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,760
Almost makes you forget he was
accused of beating a prisoner

397
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,800
with a shovel handle before
executing him, almost, but not quite.

398
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,440
The main thing
his Instagram demonstrates

399
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,920
is how much
he loves Vladimir Putin !

400
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,480
Look how happy he is there,
I've never been that happy.

401
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:36,520
Putin appointed Kadyrov to the
Chechen presidency in 2007.

402
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,480
And in return, it seems Kadyrov
is absolutely obsessed with him.

403
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,400
Look at him wearing this t-shirt
with Putin's face on it.

404
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,480
And then look at him
in this other Putin t-shirt,

405
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,960
and then in this other Putin t-shirt
and then in this Putin hoodie.

406
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,440
These are on his Instagram
and we're not even nearly done yet,

407
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,160
because here he is in another
Putin t-shirt,

408
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,720
standing next to his friend
in yet another Putin t-shirt,

409
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,480
and here is another one,

410
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,840
where everyone in the photo
is wearing a Putin t-shirt.

411
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,600
You just know that Kadyrov
is looking over

412
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,880
at his friend's sick, green
Putin t-shirt and thinking:

413
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,400
"I am so borrowing that",
and you'd be right,

414
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,960
because here he is,
wearing that exact same t-shirt.

415
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,000
It seems from his Instagram

416
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,440
the only thing that Kadyrov loves
more than Putin or Putin t-shirts,

417
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,560
is animals, because you can
also see spectacular images

418
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,320
of him holding a lion like a baby,
snoozing with a tiger,

419
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,360
having fun with a horse,
nuzzling a different horse,

420
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,440
cradling baby chicks, and holding
whatever the fuck this is.

421
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,120
Say what you will about Kadyrov,
and Human Rights Watch has,

422
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,480
but the man
knows what he wants.

423
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,480
He wants the return of this
evolutionary farce of a house pet.

424
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,560
This is a problem for all of us,

425
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,280
because when Kadyrov can't find
something, he goes a little nuts.

426
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,480
Kadyrov misplaced his phone at a big
wedding held at a museum.

427
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,040
The Chechen leader had more than
1 000 guests, including children,

428
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,560
called back to be
questioned about his phone.

429
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,600
Each of those interrogations began
with the guest asking Kadyrov:

430
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,000
"Have you tried calling phone ?
No, you're right."

431
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,520
"Calling back thousand guests
is better way".

432
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,160
But just think: if he is willing
to do that for a cell phone,

433
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,080
imagine what he is willing to put the
Chechen people through for a cat.

434
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:46,040
We need to find this man's fucking cat
and we need to do it yesterday.

435
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,200
And that is why tonight,
we are launching a campaign

436
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,400
to hashtag:
"find Kadyrov's cat".

437
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:57,480
It's simple: if you have seen his cat,
contact him on Twitter or Instagram.

438
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,400
Send him a message reading simply:
"I have seen your cat".

439
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,960
If you have not seen his cat,

440
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,360
then contact him with a message
reading: "I have not seen your cat".

441
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,200
And if you've seen something
that looks like his cat,

442
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,360
but you're not sure, take a photo,
and send it to him with the message:

443
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,280
"Is this your cat ?"

444
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:26,240
Those are the only three things
I'm asking you to send him.

445
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,320
For the good of the Chechen people
and stability in the whole region,

446
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,560
we have to find
this fucker's cat.

447
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,160
That's our show.
We are off next week, good night !

448
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,080
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

449
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,480
END OF EPISODE 13,
SEASON III
