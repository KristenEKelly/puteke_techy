00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,480
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,800
SEASON III
EPISODE 15

3
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,960
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,240
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

5
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,920
Let's begin tonight with a quick recap
of the US presidential election.

6
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,600
Or as it's now better known,

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,320
the fiery two party-pile up
on the hellbound fuckspressway.

8
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,320
There was big news this week,

9
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,960
when Hillary Clinton became
her party's presumptive nominee.

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,680
Thanks to you,
we've reached a milestone.

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,960
The first time
in our nation's history

12
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,360
that a woman will be a major party's
nominee for president of the US.

13
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,560
Now whatever you think of her,
that is a truly historic step,

14
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,960
if conspicuously overdue.

15
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,000
It's like celebrating the fact your
12-year-old has stopped breast-feeding.

16
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,320
Sure, it's definitely good news. But
it should have happened way sooner.

17
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,040
So after three years
of relentless campaigning,

18
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,200
we are left with one candidate
everyone expected,

19
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,640
and one that everyone
very much did not.

20
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,880
Because one side
of this was a real bracket buster.

21
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,080
It's like if the NCAA finals ended up
being between Duke University

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,360
and a flaming jet ski driven
by a dog dressed like a clown.

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,280
And you might've hoped this week
that the level of political discourse

24
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,800
would finally rise.

25
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,320
But after the president
endorsed Hillary, this happened...

26
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,760
Trump reacted
to the president's endorsement

27
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,600
tweeting Obama
just endorsed crooked Hillary.

28
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,720
He wants four more years of Obama
but nobody else does.

29
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,160
Clinton's campaign responding:
"Delete your account".

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,480
Now, hold on, you might
have enjoyed that tweet.

31
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,000
Frankly many did,
it has over half a million "likes".

32
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,760
But I would argue
that getting a lot of likes

33
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,920
does not mean
you've accomplished something good.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,640
That is a sentence
anyone under the age of 20

35
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,920
should frame
and hang in their bedroom.

36
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,800
There is two problems with telling
Donald Trump to delete his account.

37
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,080
He's never going to do that. Even
when he's been dead for 50 years,

38
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,080
he'll still somehow be tweeting
from beyond the grave

39
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,040
with, "Met God.
Very disappointing, dopey beard,"

40
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,520
"can't even lift a heavy rock
that he himself created. Sad."

41
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,720
And second, you just moved
this fight onto his turf,

42
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,520
which is a huge mistake.

43
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,960
Hillary was dominating
news coverage.

44
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,440
Even those
who were speaking out against her

45
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,720
were talking about substantive issues:
women's history, gender equality.

46
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,600
Because Trump is an ego-goblin
who feasts on verbal filth,

47
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,440
that national conversation,

48
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,960
much like a department store
sold out of gloves in boys' sizes,

49
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,560
was of no use to him.

50
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,920
But as soon as she engaged
with Trump on Twitter,

51
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,880
the fight was back on his turf,
and no one fights better there.

52
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,960
Trump responded, and I'll read
to you what he said on Twitter:

53
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,960
"How long did it take your staff
of 823 people to think that up ?"

54
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,520
"And where are your 33 000 emails
that you deleted ?"

55
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,720
Alright, so she really
seemed to walk into that one.

56
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,280
Yeah, yeah she absolutely did.
And that right there is the problem,

57
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,160
Hillary, you are not going to beat
Donald Trump at social media.

58
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,120
His tweets
are the Tom Cruises of tweets:

59
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,040
short and unhinged,
but you kind of can't look away.

60
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,440
And just like that, Hillary went
from a pioneer and a trailblazer

61
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,120
into a minor player
in an online spat.

62
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,760
Hillary demands Trump
delete his account.

63
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,080
That Twitter war a preview
of how ugly the fall fight could be.

64
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,640
The words "delete your account"
are fighting words.

65
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,400
It's just smack talk.

66
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,920
Our producers said that's what kids
use to say they don't like you.

67
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,280
Actually,
it's what kids used to say.

68
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,320
The minute it was tweeted by
a 68-year-old presidential candidate,

69
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,920
they moved on to whatever
the new phrase is: "eat a gerbil",

70
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,160
"snap it up, snoopy",
"not in my taco truck !"

71
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,400
But if this is how the next 5 months
are going to play out,

72
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,080
Clinton has got a problem.

73
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,440
Trump's mastery on social media
is unprecedented.

74
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,960
He misspells words,
overuses caps,

75
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,520
passes along un-vetted information
and is overtly racist.

76
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,320
He's basically Twitter's id
made manifest.

77
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,240
Whereas Hillary Clinton has been
very much hit-or-miss on social media,

78
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,880
with excruciating mistakes
like posting,

79
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,520
"seven things Hillary Clinton
has in common with your abuela",

80
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,120
or changing her Twitter avatar

81
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,360
so that Rosa Parks
was sitting at the back of her logo.

82
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,040
Oh, she took real heat for that,
and yet just a couple of weeks later,

83
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,560
she changed her logo again, this time
attempting to honor Kwanzaa like this.

84
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,400
And come on at least remove
the arrow in the logo.

85
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,120
This looks
like the campaign is saying,

86
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,320
"please move away
from the Kwanzaa celebration".

87
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,920
But for true toe-curling
tone-deafness, nothing could beat

88
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,560
one particular attempt she made
to engage young people online.

89
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,040
Hillary Clinton's attempt
to use emoji backfires.

90
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,400
On Twitter
she asked her followers...

91
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,360
How does your student loan debt make
you feel ? Tell us in 3 emojis or less.

92
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,160
That's right, three emojis.
Because nothing says,

93
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,160
I will listen o your concerns'
like saying, I'm pretty busy.

94
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,400
Can you condense your thoughts
into pictures of ghosts,

95
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,200
dolphins and sex-eggplants ?

96
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,520
Now the rest of this campaign
is going to be depressing

97
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,760
if the two people
running for president

98
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,960
a task requiring a grasp
of nuance and complexity...

99
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,880
repeatedly stoop to pandering
and flame throwing online.

100
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,240
And it seems that we are going
to need a shorthand way

101
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,760
to express our disappointment
and disgust,

102
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,840
which is why we have created this
gif of a vomiting Abraham Lincoln.

103
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,280
It is on our Twitter feed right now,
and it is all yours to have.

104
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,200
Whenever Clinton's campaign
tries to hashtag-engage us,

105
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,680
or Trump says something awful,
it's going to be pretty useful

106
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,400
in articulating
what we're all wanting to say.

107
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,720
And now this.

108
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,080
And now, people on television
asking you to imagine things.

109
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,360
Imagine hearing glass shatter
but no glass fell.

110
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,880
Or waking up to a car crash
that didn't happen.

111
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,920
Imagine coming home find that
someone had broken in to your home,

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,520
ransacked all your possessions
and even kidnapped your parrot.

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,160
Imagine being stuck inside
during like a barbeque,

114
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,160
and the barbeque being inside.

115
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,280
Imagine this,
you're at a ball game,

116
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,640
a foul ball is flying right at you
and you're carrying a baby !

117
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,800
Imagine finding out
your entire life is a lie.

118
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,600
Imagine being locked in a windowless
steel box for 17 months by choice.

119
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,040
Imagine that God purchased
the total NFL package on Direct TV.

120
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,200
Imagine your dog
having its own Twitter page.

121
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,520
Imagine not being able
to use your thumbs.

122
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,400
Imagine sleeping in a bedroom
the size of a coffin.

123
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,440
Imagine being asleep
and then being stung by bees.

124
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,160
Moving on: our main story tonight
concerns money.

125
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,160
The thing everyone
likes to think they're good with,

126
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,080
despite the evidence provided in every
episode of the Suze Orman show.

127
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,400
Tina, what do you want to buy ?

128
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,960
Hi, Suze. Thanks for taking my call.
I'd like to buy a Mercedes E550.

129
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,280
It's about $1 400 a month.
That is true. You are denied.

130
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,080
I want to get
a Louis Vuitton Tivoli PM bag.

131
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,000
So denied it's not even funny.
I'm gonna deny you again.

132
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,120
I would like to buy a study
abroad in Iceland.

133
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,560
I want to go to the famous
elf school in Reykjavik

134
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,560
and get a certification
as an elf spotter.

135
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,040
Here's the thing, I'm denying you.

136
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,680
Yeah, of course she is !

137
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,720
No one should be spending $4 000
to get an elf-spotting qualification.

138
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,480
If you go to lastweektonight.com,

139
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,480
you can print out a free,
official elf-spotting certificate,

140
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,720
which is every bit as valid as the
most expensive elf-spotting education.

141
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,640
Now go spot some elves.

142
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,840
One of the big reasons that
Suze Orman denies so many people

143
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,440
is because she thinks we all
should be saving for our retirement.

144
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,000
It is important to acknowledge:

145
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,200
there are people who just
do not have the money to do that,

146
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,960
for systemic reasons that we've
addressed on this show before

147
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,600
on "Johnny O's Sad-tastical
Circus of Misery and Math."

148
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,360
But tonight, let's talk about those
who can save for retirement.

149
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,600
The target audience
for ads like this !

150
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,320
We asked people "How much money
you think you'll need when you retire ?"

151
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,280
then we gave each person a ribbon
to show how many years that might last.

152
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,960
I was trying to pull it further,
to stretch it a little bit more...

153
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,840
Got me to 70 years old. I'm going
to have to re-think this thing.

154
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,200
That's a pretty creepy ad.

155
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,360
It's basically people walking
toward the date of their own death.

156
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,640
The only way it could've been creepier
is if, at the end,

157
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,520
it said exactly how each person
was going to die.

158
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,720
But look, it is true that,
as we all live longer,

159
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,800
you should absolutely save
for retirement if you can.

160
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,480
And many do, we currently have
around 24 trillion dollars

161
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,480
sitting in retirement assets.

162
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,760
That figure doesn't include the wealth
we have in stockpiled beanie babies,

163
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,560
so let's call it
24 trillion and 32 dollars.

164
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,640
A lot of that money is in the hands
of financial services companies.

165
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,560
Let's talk about how they work.
Which I know sounds boring,

166
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,120
but it is worth watching
this for 20 minutes,

167
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,760
because you could easily
make small mistakes

168
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,360
which could seriously
cost you down the line.

169
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,040
So let's start with financial advisers,
they are the wholesome,

170
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,880
friendly-faced experts that you see
in ads like this one, from Chase.

171
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,840
Our trusted advisers
are with you every step of the way.

172
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,760
Thanks for helping me
plan for my retirement.

173
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,920
- You should come celebrate with us.
- I'd be honored.

174
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,840
Plan with advisers
you know and trust.

175
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,160
Wait, that is a clear example
of deceptive advertising.

176
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,400
Because nobody invites their
financial adviser to a wedding.

177
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,000
If cousin Barbara finds out
that she didn't get an invite

178
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,880
but your Chase guy did,
she's going to flip her shit on you.

179
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,080
There is something you should
know about financial advisers:

180
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,960
even their name
means less than you might think.

181
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,560
The financial industry regulatory
authority warns customers

182
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,920
to "be aware that financial analyst,
financial adviser,"

183
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,600
"financial consultant,
financial planner, or wealth manager"

184
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,760
are generic terms and may be used
by investment professionals

185
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,960
who may not hold
any specific credential.

186
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,720
Financial analyst is a fancy term
that doesn't actually mean anything.

187
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,560
Sort of like "brand ambassador"
or "the John Oliver effect".

188
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,800
Meaningless.
Completely meaningless.

189
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,120
Even many well-credentialed financial
advisers are paid on commission.

190
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,000
If they recommend something, it may be
because they stand to make money,

191
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:08,080
in fact sometimes they're incentivized
not to act in your best interest.

192
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,720
Take annuities:
now certain types of those

193
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,360
can be complicated investment products
that have high fees,

194
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,760
and would be appropriate
for certain types of portfolios.

195
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,880
But some financial advisers
push them hard.

196
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,640
Just look how Suze Orman
reacts when a caller,

197
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,920
who had just inherited $80 000,
asked for some advice...

198
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,840
We have talked
to a financial adviser,

199
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,480
and he recommended
that we put it in an annuity.

200
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,560
I knew it. Before you said that,
I was gonna say, wait !

201
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,320
Let me tell you. I could tell you
what the financial adviser said.

202
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,920
Did that adviser also say to you
that if you put that $80,000 in there,

203
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,400
I'm gonna make
about $4 000 of commissions,

204
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,000
did he or she happen
to tell you that, as well ?

205
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,520
"He or she" ! Thank you,
Suzie Orman, for pointing out

206
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,520
disingenuous financial
swindlers can be women too !

207
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,840
Hashtag ladycrimes,
hashtag feminism.

208
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,360
And yeah, why not ?

209
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,480
Brokers pushing annuities
may not just be getting money.

210
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,000
Elizabeth Warren released a report
on sales perks in the annuity industry

211
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,920
ranging from free cruises
to luxury watches

212
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:23,040
to this tacky super bowl-style
ring, which is absolutely ghastly.

213
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,400
At least it makes it easy to spot
brokers you shouldn't work with.

214
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,320
Nice ring, Irwin.
But I'm going to guess

215
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,120
you didn't get that playing running
back for the Green Bay Packers.

216
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:41,120
It is legal for financial advisers to
put their interests ahead of yours,

217
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,160
unless, and this is interesting,
they are what's called a fiduciary.

218
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,920
Not all financial advisers are bound
to act in your best interest,

219
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,280
but fiduciaries are,
which is a bit weird.

220
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,680
It's like finding out that only
some restaurant waiters

221
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,280
are forbidden
from ejaculating in your soup.

222
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,960
Why is it up to me to ask you
which kind you are ?

223
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,520
I'm sending this chowder back.
I'm not risking it ! You take it back.

224
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,720
But financial advisers
are just one part of this.

225
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,120
If you are lucky, your job
offers a 401-k retirement plan.

226
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,640
If it does, you should
take advantage of it.

227
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,720
They can be a goldmine
for financial service companies.

228
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,560
It's not unreasonable for them
to get paid for providing a service,

229
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,840
there can be a lot of different fees.

230
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,280
There are legal fees, trustee fees,
transactional fees, stewardship fees,

231
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,320
bookkeeping fees, finders' fees
and the list goes on and on.

232
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,120
I wouldn't be surprised
if they had an elf-spotting fee,

233
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,640
but thanks to your certification,
you no longer have to pay it.

234
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,840
Go spot some elves.

235
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Seemingly tiny fees
can really mount up,

236
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,560
thanks to something
called "compound interest".

237
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,160
Whenever retirement companies
like Prudential mention that,

238
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,760
if you
start with a small investment,

239
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,280
by the time you retire,
it will have substantially grown.

240
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,480
It's hard to imagine
how something so small

241
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,680
can help with something so big.

242
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,000
If you start putting that
towards your retirement every week

243
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,440
and let it grow over time,
for twenty to thirty years,

244
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,400
that retirement challenge

245
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,640
might not seem so big after all.

246
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,280
Holy shit, is it me, or did that last
domino fall "really" hard ?

247
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,160
Might be the most upsetting
commercial involving dominos

248
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,520
that doesn't involve the phrase
"Cali chicken bacon ranch".

249
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,000
Compound interest
works both ways,

250
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,640
while your money adds up,
your fees can really add up, too.

251
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,920
You invested in a fund that is earning
a gross annual return of 7 percent.

252
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,720
They charge you
a 2 percent annual fee.

253
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,880
Over 50 years, the difference
between your net, the red line,

254
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,160
and what you'd have made without
fees, green line, is staggering.

255
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,240
You've lost almost two thirds
of what you would have had.

256
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,000
Two-thirds of what
you would've had is gone.

257
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,920
So think of fees like termites.
Tiny, they're barely noticeable

258
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,440
and they
can eat away your future.

259
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,560
One place where your 401-k can
be full of termites is the funds.

260
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,640
You can choose between
low-fee index funds,

261
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,280
which try to match the average
returns of the stock market,

262
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,800
or, for a higher fee, you can get
an "actively managed" fund,

263
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,720
with experts who will pick stocks
for you, trying to beat the market.

264
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,880
Companies that sell active funds
really believe in themselves.

265
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,680
At MFS investment management,

266
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,720
we believe active management
can protect capital long term.

267
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,080
Active management
can take calculated risks.

268
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,680
Active management
can seek to outperform.

269
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,880
Active investment management
isn't reactive, it's active.

270
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,520
That's not so much
a coherent commercial

271
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,760
as it is a drinking game where you do
a shot every time he says "active".

272
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:26,080
But even many Wall Street experts
find it difficult to beat the market.

273
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,920
There is sometimes
embarrassing evidence,

274
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,720
like when professionals were
pitted in a stock-picking challenge

275
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,680
against a cat named Orlando.

276
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,880
Orlando throws a toy mouse at a grid
of companies, very scientific.

277
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,320
Last year Orlando's picks returned
11% while the pros gained 3.5 percent.

278
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:52,720
My God ! Let's all agree that
"The Wolf of Wall Street"

279
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,360
would have been way better
starring that cat.

280
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,440
Of course, instead of drugs,
there's a plot hole...

281
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,840
His downfall would come when someone
bust out a laser pointer in a meeting.

282
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,440
But that cat wasn't
a complete anomaly.

283
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:15,400
Over the longterm,
most managed funds do no better

284
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,920
and often do worse
than the market.

285
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,240
It's the plot of
"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory".

286
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,200
If you stick around doing nothing
while everyone around you fucks up,

287
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,920
you're going to win big.

288
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,960
This is not a secret.

289
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,360
Even some of the people charging those
fees know that this is the reality.

290
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,120
One of the ultimate dirty secrets
of the fund industry

291
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,440
is that a lot of people who run
the other fund companies

292
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:50,000
own index funds in their
own accounts and don't talk about it,

293
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,040
unless you put
a couple beers in them.

294
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,040
"Sometimes I invest
in index funds"

295
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,240
might be the least interesting secret
anyone ever divulged while drunk.

296
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,480
It's up there with "my favorite
movie is "The Constant Gardener"

297
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,440
and "in college,
I got totally wasted"

298
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,160
"and read the entire Wikipedia page
for "rope".

299
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,400
So don't tell anyone.

300
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,640
Between financial advisers, high fees,
underperforming active management,

301
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,960
the retirement-plan industry
is a potential minefield.

302
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,280
You need to pay attention.
And the reason that we know about this

303
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,320
is, earlier this year, we decided
to set up a 401-k for our employees.

304
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,160
You might want to learn from our
experience. Here's what happened:

305
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,760
we reached out to the production
company behind this show,

306
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,200
and we asked them
to take care of it.

307
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,880
They told us: "we have your plan,
it's provided by John Hancock".

308
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,120
We said okay
and we went back to work.

309
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,800
We went back to Googling
"teacup pigs eating ice cream".

310
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:07,680
In March, representatives gave our
staff presentations on their new plan.

311
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,360
It's a thing no one in their right
mind wants to sit through.

312
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,400
Most of us spent it on our
phones Googling,

313
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,800
"teacup pig, comma top hat,
comma, shopping, comma beer".

314
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,560
And boom.
We hit the fucking jackpot.

315
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,680
Our researchers started
going through the documents

316
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,640
adding up the fees, which came
to a combined 1.69 percent,

317
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,360
before we paid a $24 per person per
year fee and the fees on our funds.

318
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,840
They asked John Hancock
why the fees were that high,

319
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,480
and we were told that it was
normal for a startup plan,

320
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,520
and Hancock gave us a lower number
that it would come down to over time.

321
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,280
We said: "That sounds fine".
And our researchers said:

322
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,440
"That number is still higher than
experts have told us we'd want it".

323
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:07,600
"We'll figure it out. Go back to
Googling teacup pigs in teacups".

324
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,800
We went: "My god, is
that a thing that exists and it was !"

325
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,400
That was the rest of our
afternoon. Right there.

326
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:24,560
Our researchers sent the Hancock
contract to financial experts,

327
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,320
who flagged an "intermediary fee"
to a broker,

328
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,640
one percent the first year
and half a percent after that.

329
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,840
With 35 employees
contributing just $6,000 a year,

330
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:42,440
after 30 years, half a percent could
add up to roughly a million dollars.

331
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,080
That number was so high, you'll
never guess what happened:

332
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,280
Janice in accounting
actually gave a fuck.

333
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,040
I'm serious !
She's a changed woman now.

334
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:00,320
She brought cupcakes for the break
room and she adopted a kitten.

335
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,760
We asked:
"who the fuck is this broker ?"

336
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:10,080
He was a guy Avalon paid to help
them set up and administer our plan.

337
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:16,240
We asked: why didn't you present us
with low-cost plans like Vanguard ?

338
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,360
What are we paying you so much for ?

339
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,240
He said our plan was too
complicated for Vanguard.

340
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,000
He did a lot of things for us,
like acting as our financial adviser.

341
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,000
Although, as we now know, that term
doesn't necessarily mean much.

342
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,720
If you go to our website,
you can print out a free,

343
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,280
official financial advisor certificate
and there you go !

344
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,280
Congratulations, you are one, too.
Well done !

345
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,800
Our broker has other credentials,
when we asked if he was a fiduciary,

346
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,640
he, unsurprisingly, said no.

347
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,240
He said his fees would come down.
He sent us an excel spreadsheet

348
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,600
showing how they could come
down as our fund assets grew.

349
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:05,000
He made an error, our fund's
interest didn't compound correctly.

350
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,440
We pointed that out,
he sent a second sheet,

351
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,120
showing that his original math had
been off by more than $10 million.

352
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,200
Which does not inspire
confidence in the man

353
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,240
who was helping us navigate
our very complicated plan.

354
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,760
Our lawyers say I have to tell you
that the broker and John Hancock

355
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,840
claim their fees would come down,
they're worth it for the services.

356
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,080
We decided early on to pay almost
all the fees for our employees

357
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,040
because we were embarrassed about
the situation that we got them in.

358
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,960
We're going to be leaving both
Hancock and the broker.

359
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,160
I'm guessing after they've seen this
show, they will be happy to let us go.

360
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:54,480
We'll be replacing both of them
with that stock-picking cat,

361
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,200
'cause he seems
to really know his shit.

362
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:05,160
The whole point of telling you this
is if you don't pay close attention,

363
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,320
all of this can get away from you.

364
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:13,560
It doesn't actually have to be
that complicated.

365
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,040
In April, the Department of Labor
issued a final rule

366
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:23,280
requiring that "all" advisors handling
retirement accounts act as fiduciaries

367
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,920
and that is great, because the
industry fought this rule hard.

368
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,200
They even launched terrible ads:
might have seen one like this on TV.

369
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,680
These new regulations worry me.

370
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,120
They want to make it hard to get
advice from our advisor.

371
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,720
No more help from Anne ?
Even with our IRA and 401k savings ?

372
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,400
Only if we want to pay more.

373
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,240
We'll never get the information
we need. We'll call our senators.

374
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,760
My only takeaway from that ad is that
that guy is definitely fucking Anne.

375
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,920
It's so obvious. Leave him
"non-threatening wife character".

376
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,480
Kick him to the curb.

377
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,080
While the rule has
gone through anyway,

378
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,360
five lawsuits have been filed by
financial-services groups attacking it

379
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,680
and legislators passed a resolution
to overturn that fiduciary rule,

380
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,160
although a few days ago,
the president did veto it.

381
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,680
That is something I think we're
going to be seeing a lot more of.

382
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,360
Obama's last year in office
seems to be moving

383
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,600
from "bipartisan solution"
to "bye Felicia".

384
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,000
I am not saying
all of this is not complicated.

385
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,560
We spent weeks just trying
to understand our own 401-k plan.

386
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,680
For your average person
trying to save for retirement,

387
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,840
it doesn't need
to be this confusing.

388
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:51,440
As long as you remember a few key
things, you're going to be fine.

389
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,360
We wanted to outline them. Whenever
you are able to save for retirement,

390
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,400
come back and re-play this video,
from this exact spot.

391
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,160
Enjoy !

392
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,240
I'm Billy Eichner and I'm here
with a bunch of fucking ribbon.

393
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,280
I'm using it to show people how much
they needed to save for retirement.

394
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,040
Look at you !
You're so precocious.

395
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,360
One tiny thing, these are fees.
That's your recordkeeping fee,

396
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,120
that's your wrap fee,
that's your monthly participation fee,

397
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,640
that's your 12B-1 fee, that goes to
some middle man you don't know about

398
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,600
and that's your fee for not knowing
about a fee, fee !

399
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,840
Here's what you've got left !
Try ribbon dancing with this !

400
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,120
Idiots like Karen
here make shitty choices

401
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,160
about what to do
with their money.

402
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,160
If you had $4,000, would you
invest it in your 401(k)

403
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,240
or go
to the elf school in Reykjavik ?

404
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,080
- Elf school ?
- No ! You put it in your 401(k) !

405
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,480
The only elf you should be studying
is Kristin Chenoweth !

406
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,960
Come out, Kristin !

407
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,640
Hi, Billy. I love elves, and who
wouldn't want to go to Reykjavik ?

408
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,720
It's not the Tony Awards.
Go !

409
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,080
That was Kristin Chenoweth.

410
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,480
The best advice most experts
can give you is to do 5 things.

411
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,080
Number one, start saving now.
In fact, start saving 10 years ago.

412
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,840
Invent a time machine, use it
to go back and start saving money.

413
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:22,520
Then, kill baby Hitler.
Next, average people like you,

414
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,200
and let's face it,
you're very average,

415
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,360
should just invest in low-cost
index funds and leave it alone.

416
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,360
Check on it as often
as you Google

417
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,840
whether or not Gene Hackman
is still alive, about once a year.

418
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,440
And he is ! He's still alive !
He's writing novels now.

419
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,600
Third thing, if you have an advisor,
ask if they're a fiduciary.

420
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,400
If they say no, run.

421
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,160
If they say yes but they're wearing
a tacky Super Bowl ring, run.

422
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,760
If they say yes but they're
wearing a class ring, run !

423
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,120
It's very strange when a grown man
is wearing a class ring.

424
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,840
The fuck is a fiduciary ?
Number four, as you get older,

425
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,480
shift your investments
from stocks to bonds.

426
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:08,200
Every time they pick a new James Bond,
switch more of your stocks into bonds,

427
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,680
go back to wondering if
Daniel Craig is actually attractive.

428
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,680
- What do you think, Doris ?
- He's so handsome.

429
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,960
He looks like a blonde chimpanzee
in a tux and you know it.

430
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,360
I wish this was Veep.

431
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,040
Try to keep your fees like your milk,
under one percent.

432
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,000
Like interest compounds,
so do fees.

433
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,240
And even one tenth of one percent
can really fuck you.

434
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,000
Like this.

435
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,760
- Shit ! Kristin, watch out !
- What ?

436
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,800
That reminds me.
One last tip, don't forget to die.

437
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,480
- Billy, I'm not dead.
- Kristin, you're even shorter now !

438
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,960
Stop coughing. Disgusting.
Excuse me.

439
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,280
Retirement, no Kristin Chenoweth's
were harmed in the filming.

440
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,160
Thank you so much for watching,
see you next week, goodnight !

441
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,760
I love elves, who
wouldn't want to go to Reykjavik ?

442
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,960
Go back !

443
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,960
Give me this ! Take it off !
It's not "Behind the Candelabra" !

444
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,760
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

445
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,920
END OF EPISODE 15,
SEASON III
