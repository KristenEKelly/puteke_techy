00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,600
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,320
SEASON III
EPISODE 19

3
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,640
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,160
Thank you for joining us.
Time for a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,440
And we begin with the 2016 election.

6
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,040
Or as you probably know it, America's
shit salad fuckstravaganza 2016.

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,400
It was the Democratic National
Convention this week

8
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,560
more on that later,
but as of right now,

9
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,400
polls suggest that this race
is extremely tight.

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,200
Even tighter than the perfectly
normal grip that this father has

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,680
on the hips
of his own adult daughter.

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,000
There is no doubt: the stakes
of this election are incredibly high,

13
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,000
which is why what happened
this week is so important.

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,760
On Friday, just over 100 days
before the 2016 election,

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,920
3 courts in 3 states struck down
three attempts at voter suppression.

16
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,080
A triple victory for voting rights.

17
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,640
Yes, a triple-crown victory !

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,520
And now,
as per triple-crown tradition,

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,720
democracy will be drained
of its seed and promptly shot.

20
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,240
Yes, a string of voting restrictions
were struck down this week

21
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,920
in Wisconsin, Texas,
and most notably North Carolina,

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,960
birthplace of Charlie Rose,
Vince McMahon, Gallagher, Fred Durst.

23
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,240
Or as I like to call them,
"the real Mount Rushmore."

24
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,080
All states were criticized for enacting
laws with a discriminatory effect.

25
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,200
But the 4th circuit had particularly
strong language for North Carolina.

26
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,360
The court called it
the "most restrictive voting law"

27
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,360
"North Carolina
has seen since the era of Jim Crow,"

28
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,120
saying the law's provisions,

29
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,640
"target African Americans
with almost surgical precision."

30
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,480
Targeting African Americans
with almost surgical precision.

31
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,480
That is not a phrase you ever want
to hear outside of a marketing meeting

32
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,760
for "dark and lovely healthy-gloss
shea butter relaxer."

33
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,400
It's okay for me to tell that joke.
I'm pretty sure that joke is fine.

34
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,160
I'm about 80% confident
we have no problem there.

35
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,600
When you hear what North Carolina's
voter-ID law contained,

36
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,920
it is hard to disagree
with that court.

37
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,640
The law required voters
to show certain photo ID's

38
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,280
that white voters
were more likely to possess

39
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,720
and eliminated
other voter-access tools

40
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,520
like same-day registration
and a full week of early voting.

41
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,800
Scaling back early voting eliminated
one Souls to the Polls Sunday,

42
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,720
where African American churches
provide transportation for voters.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,520
It's true,
they limited "Souls to the Polls".

44
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Which is not to be confused
with my charity foundation,

45
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,880
"Soles to the Poles",
which sends shoes to Polish people,

46
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,640
despite the fact they haven't
asked for them,

47
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,800
and have repeatedly
asked me to stop.

48
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,840
Now to be fair: at the time,
politicians in North Carolina

49
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,080
were insistent that this bill
was passed for good reasons.

50
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,680
David Lewis chaired the elections
committee when that bill passed.

51
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,440
He says it makes
the voting process fairer.

52
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,520
Even if you want
to attest or believe

53
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,120
that we did something
for partisan advantage,

54
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,280
it certainly wasn't done
with a racially discriminatory intent.

55
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,760
That is an amazing pushback:

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,640
"I'm happy to let you say we did this
to disenfranchise Democrats."

57
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,160
"But not black people."

58
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,960
"Please paint me as the
correct kind of asshole."

59
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,760
"Please do me that good."

60
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,000
"Good day sir.
I said good day !"

61
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,320
Unfortunately, as the court
pointed out, race was a factor,

62
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,360
given that, before the law passed,

63
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,400
legislators specifically requested data
on voting practices by race,

64
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,720
and then
"upon receipt of the race data,"

65
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,320
"the General Assembly
enacted legislation"

66
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,360
"that restricted voting
and registration in 5 ways,"

67
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,560
"all of which
affected African Americans."

68
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,040
And think about that:

69
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,120
they didn't go with their gut and
"think" it would be discriminatory.

70
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,920
They got the spreadsheets,
crunched the numbers,

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,680
and they knew it would be.

72
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,120
I don't know how you did it,
North Carolina,

73
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,960
but I think you officially
moneyball'ed racism.

74
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,960
Forget "first in flight".
Your new state motto should be

75
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,960
"North Carolina:
ignorance at its smartest."

76
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,920
But for now,
let's move on to Turkey,

77
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,360
AKA, Diet Syria.

78
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,320
Two weeks ago,
Turkey was nearly rocked to its core.

79
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,880
All hell is breaking lose in Turkey
right now.

80
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,200
Explosions and gunfire
rocking the capital of Turkey

81
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,280
where reports of a military coup
started breaking just a few hours ago.

82
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,240
They declared Martial law.
Police were shooting at helicopters.

83
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,640
Wait, shooting at helicopters ?

84
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,840
Turkey, I don't want to tell you
how to defend yourself,

85
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,600
but if the fourth "Die Hard"
taught me anything,

86
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,600
it's that you don't shoot down
helicopters with guns.

87
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,760
You simply do this  !

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,720
Is that so hard ?
Is that really so hard ?

89
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:43,040
Historically Turkey is no stranger
to violent military coups

90
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,760
this was their fourth
in the last sixty years.

91
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,800
They should be hosting the quadrennial
"World Coup" tournament,

92
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,800
featuring unstable regimes
from around the world,

93
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,880
organized, of course, by FIFA.

94
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,920
But this most recent attempt
surprised everyone.

95
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,040
President Erdogan
was even on vacation at the time,

96
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,800
and tried to address the nation
using an unconventional medium.

97
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,680
President Erdogan,
who was on vacation,

98
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,920
spoke first
via Facetime on Turkish TV

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,840
and called for his supporters
to take to the streets.

100
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,480
He used Facetime.

101
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,240
Erdogan tried to hold his nation
together with the same technology

102
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,520
your mom uses to make you
wish her dog a happy birthday.

103
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,960
"Happy birthday, dog.
Can I please talk to my mother now ?"

104
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,000
The coup turned out
to be short-lived,

105
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,480
and in the last two weeks,
Erdogan has been taking his revenge.

106
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,840
They've called it rooting
out the virus.

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,280
A wave of arrests
over the past fortnight

108
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,680
against the alleged coup plotters
and those who backed them.

109
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,360
Journalists, diplomats, NGOs,
even Turkish airline staff have

110
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,200
been detained or dismissed.

111
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,400
Journalists and diplomats,
you would expect.

112
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,360
But detaining airline staff ?

113
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,640
Erdogan is clearly
just settling personal scores.

114
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,560
A flight attendant refused to give him
the entire can of Schweppes in 1999,

115
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,160
and now the entire industry
is in prison - it's bullshit.

116
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,880
As of yesterday, over 10 000 people
have been arrested,

117
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,480
and more than 60 000 have been
detained, removed or suspended.

118
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,320
Erdogan points the finger of blame
firmly at this man, Fetullah Gulen.

119
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,120
He's a Muslim academic
and a one-time Erdogan ally,

120
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,680
although Turkey's leaders now
insist that he's a grave threat.

121
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,800
Turkish prime minister recently
compared Gulen and his supporters

122
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,040
to a virus and a medieval
cult of assassins.

123
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,080
What ?!
A medieval cult of assassins ?

124
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,520
If you want to ruin
the reputation of your enemies,

125
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,840
maybe don't make them
sound outrageously awesome.

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,320
"Fettullah Gulen ?
Don't listen to him."

127
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,480
"He's like a monster truck
wearing aviator sunglasses"

128
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,360
"or a wolf
that plays the electric guitar."

129
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,040
"I don't see the appeal."

130
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,600
And if you are wondering
how Gulen is still alive,

131
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,640
he actually exiled himself
17 years ago,

132
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,440
and has been living
in the last place you'd expect.

133
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,720
One of the world's most powerful
Muslim preachers

134
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,000
lives behind these gates
in a compound

135
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,480
located in the small, leafy town
of Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania.

136
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,560
Yes, the alleged instigator
of the Turkish coup

137
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,160
lives in rural Saylorsburg,
Pennsylvania

138
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,960
among, I'm guessing,
tree-lined streets, Lyme disease,

139
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,040
six Wawas, and a taffy museum;
I'm guessing.

140
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,640
And while Gulen denies
any involvement in the coup,

141
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,040
I do not envy him. Because you
do not want Erdogan as an enemy.

142
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,440
Remember, this is a man who has had
his genitals stomped on by a horse,

143
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,280
and lived to tell the story.

144
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,920
If anything, that horse was going
around injured for weeks afterwards.

145
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,000
And in international politics,
there is one hard and fast rule:

146
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,240
there is no more dangerous enemy
than a man with a horse-proof dick.

147
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,720
And now this !

148
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,800
And now, Last Week Tonight asks:
"How is This Still a Thing ?"

149
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,800
This week: tanning beds.
How are they still a thing ?

150
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,440
If you go by TV and movies,

151
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,440
tanning beds are only used
by 3 types of people:

152
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,320
psychopaths,
asshole Rob Lowes...

153
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,320
I can't stop saying bro, bro.

154
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,360
And potential murder victims.

155
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,760
But tanning beds are still used
by a surprising number of people.

156
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,520
There are more tanning salons in US
than there are Dunkin Donuts:

157
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,120
there are more places
to get medium-roasted,

158
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,800
than there are places
to drink a medium roast.

159
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,280
In fact, tanning salons
are a 3 billion dollar industry,

160
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,040
impressive, considering that
they only began in the 1970s,

161
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,600
when the modern tanning beds
were introduced

162
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,160
by German scientist and creepy
man spreader, Friedrich Wolff.

163
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,920
And their popularity
is even more impressive

164
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,240
when you consider
what they can do to you.

165
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,920
CDC says thousands of people
were sent to the ER last year

166
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,080
after getting hurt in tanning beds.

167
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,160
Researchers are certain tanning beds
and UV radiation cause cancer.

168
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,520
The World Health Organization
recently added tanning beds

169
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,360
to its group one list
of cancer causing substances

170
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,160
the same group as cigarettes.

171
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,400
Basically tanning beds
are the product of deviant sex

172
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,680
between a cigarette
and a sleeping bag.

173
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,960
Press like this
would destroy most industries,

174
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,320
luckily,
tanning beds have trade groups

175
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,960
who fight regulation with every UV
damaged fiber of their being.

176
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,160
We need ultra violet light.

177
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,920
To say UV light is harmful
and should be avoided

178
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,480
is like saying water causes drowning
and you should avoid water.

179
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,600
That's international Smart Tan
Network Vice President

180
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,080
and industry magazine
cover-boy Joe Levy.

181
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,560
Not only does he believe
that tanning beds don't cause cancer,

182
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,480
he suggests that by boosting
your vitamin D levels,

183
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,120
they can prevent cancer.

184
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,560
A new Georgetown University study
is showing that higher vitamin D levels

185
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,920
in a clinical study

186
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,760
are associated with a twofold
reduction in risk of breast cancer.

187
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,960
Yeah, except that's not
what the study really said.

188
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,200
It found vitamin D could decrease
or increase breast cancer development,

189
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,120
in mice, yes, mice.

190
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,280
And besides, if you want vitamin D,

191
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,320
you don't need to pay to lay
in a bed of glass and mercury,

192
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,320
you could go outside for 10 minutes,
3 times a week,

193
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,960
or swallow some milk, fish,
hundreds of vitamin-D fortified foods,

194
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,640
or just a fucking vitamin-D pill.

195
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,120
So if turning your skin
into cancerous creme brulee crust

196
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,440
is the only reason
to use a tanning bed,

197
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,120
we have to ask: tanning beds,
how are they still a thing ?

198
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:44,360
Moving on ! Let's move on
to the 2016 election.

199
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,160
As it's known, a horrifying glimpse
at Satan's Pinterest board 2016.

200
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,760
This week was
the Democratic National Convention,

201
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,040
and after the bizarre Republican
circus that preceded it,

202
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,880
all they had to do was not appear
like a complete disaster.

203
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,640
And, yet, somehow...

204
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,880
Their party's chairman off the program,
an apparent Russian e-mail hack

205
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,720
and now a revolt
among Bernie Sanders supporters.

206
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,560
Welcome to day one
of the Democratic Convention.

207
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,320
That was day one ! Day one !

208
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,880
The DNC got off
to the roughest start that I've seen

209
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,560
since Fox 5's 2011 coverage
of the San Diego boat show.

210
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,280
I'm hanging out with my friend John.
Fox Five morning news starts.

211
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,800
And it starts right now !

212
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,720
That is basically what happened
on day one of the DNC in a nutshell.

213
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,040
Before Debbie Wasserman-Schultz
could even gavel in the convention,

214
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,800
a leaked email scandal
had forced her to resign

215
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,120
and Bernie Sanders supporters
gave her a rough reception

216
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,760
when she met
with her own state's delegation.

217
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,040
We know that the voices
in this room

218
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,440
that are standing up
and being disruptive,

219
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,440
we know that that's not
the Florida that we know.

220
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,240
Disruptive, borderline unhinged,
and getting ready to fuck up a vote ?

221
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,240
That is literally the only Florida
that we know.

222
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,840
The only way that could be
any more Florida

223
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,720
is if one of the Bernie delegates

224
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,400
was an aging,
heavily armed racist alligator.

225
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,680
Now, luckily for the Democrats,
things gradually got back on track

226
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,720
thanks to a series of stirring speeches,
beginning with the first lady.

227
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,800
Today, I wake up every morning
in a house that was built by slaves.

228
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,720
And I watch my daughters,

229
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,800
two beautiful, intelligent,
black young women

230
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,160
playing with their dogs
on the White House lawn.

231
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,920
Whatever your party affiliation,
that is a truly moving speech.

232
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,840
The only thing I would say
to the audience is:

233
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,360
maybe don't start your round
of applause directly following

234
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,200
the phrase "built by slaves".

235
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,640
Yeah, they did a lovely job.
They had to.

236
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,080
They had to do a good job.
They had to, that's why. Lovely.

237
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,720
The next day, it was Bill Clinton's
turn to fire up the crowd,

238
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,520
retelling his relationship
with Hillary, seemingly in real time.

239
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,480
On Wednesday,
Joe Biden spoke,

240
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,800
assuming the role of America's
motivational cattle prod.

241
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:37,240
We are America. Second to none.
And we own the finish line.

242
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,520
Don't forget it.
God bless you all.

243
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,240
May God protect our troops.
Come on. We're America.

244
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,360
Come on !
Once he has left the White House,

245
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,360
Biden is going to be the most
inspiring SoulCycle instructor.

246
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,120
"Come on ! Pedal ! You own
the finish line, Caitlyn !"

247
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,800
"Pedal like the wind !"

248
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,400
Biden was the warm-up man
for the President,

249
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,160
who occasionally lapsed
into a tone of actual disbelief

250
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,840
at what America might be
doing this election.

251
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,480
People outside of the United States
do not understand

252
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,200
what's going on in this election,
they really don't.

253
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,400
That's actually true.

254
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,800
The rest of the world does not
understand Trump's candidacy,

255
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,160
any more than the menu
at Guy Fieri's American Kitchen.

256
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,280
This... donkey sauce.
Is it made from actual donkey ?

257
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,200
Why do you do this to yourself ?
Why ?

258
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,280
Why ?

259
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,160
But the emotional highlight
was a speech by Khizr Khan,

260
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,280
a lawyer, immigrant and father
of a fallen Muslim-American soldier.

261
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:04,640
Donald Trump, you ask Americans
to trust you with their future.

262
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,080
Let me ask you:

263
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,080
have you even read
the United States Constitution ?

264
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:25,720
I will gladly lend you my copy.

265
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,200
Shit.

266
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:35,200
An American founding document
being used as a middle finger.

267
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,480
I did not know that
was technically possible.

268
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,640
It wasn't even the most devastating
part of Mr. Khan's speech.

269
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,080
Have you ever been
to Arlington Cemetery ?

270
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,560
Go look at the graves
of brave patriots

271
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,000
who died defending
United States of America.

272
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:05,600
You will see all faiths,
genders and ethnicities.

273
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:14,040
You have sacrificed nothing
and no one.

274
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,160
That engendered in me
a level of emotion

275
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,800
that I did not think was possible
after 16 months of this campaign

276
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,560
and 39 years on Earth
as a British person.

277
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,400
The truth here is, however incredible
the surrogate speeches are,

278
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,680
conventions are judged by
the performances of the two people.

279
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,440
So how did they fare ?
Let's start with Tim Kaine.

280
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,120
A human sweater-vest.

281
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,520
He's the portrait of a vice president
that came with the frame.

282
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,720
His speech was exactly as boring
as you would expect,

283
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,440
with the exception of his
impressively-bad Trump impression.

284
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,880
It's gonna be great, believe me !

285
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,040
We're gonna build a wall and make
Mexico pay for it, believe me !

286
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,000
We're gonna destroy ISIS so fast,
believe me !

287
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,680
What the fuck was that ?
That doesn't sound like him at all !

288
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,480
How is he going to win an election,
he couldn't win a game of Cranium ?

289
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,880
I don't know, is it Jackie Gleason ?
Brad Garrett ?

290
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,040
Mold whoever it is out of clay,
we have no chance here.

291
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,360
And as for Hillary Clinton, on
the night of her historic nomination,

292
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,440
she stood before the nation
in full Pitbull cosplay,

293
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:44,800
she had a stupid amount of
balloons dropped on her head,

294
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,320
and delivered a speech focusing on
the requirements of being president.

295
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,240
I sweat the details of policy,
whether we're talking about

296
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,600
the exact level of lead in
the drinking water in Flint, Michigan,

297
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,560
the number of mental
health facilities in Iowa

298
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,560
or the cost
of your prescription drugs.

299
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:12,400
Because it's not just a detail
if it's your kid,

300
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,080
if it's your family,
it's a big deal.

301
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,400
A kind of interesting approach.
Instead of soaring rhetoric,

302
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,560
the bulk of her speech
was basically:

303
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,520
I'm gonna micromanage
the shit out of this office.

304
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm gonna get granular as fuck.

305
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,080
Drop the balloons
and I will count them all !

306
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,400
I'm all about the details.

307
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,200
It was definitely a restrained speech
to close a convention,

308
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,080
especially when you compare it
to the week before,

309
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,040
when Trump opened his mouth
and exhaled a swarm of locusts.

310
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,320
Now that both conventions
are behind us,

311
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,440
we should try and take stock
of what they have taught us

312
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,520
about the current state
of our two political parties.

313
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,320
The DNC showed the Democrats
to be a coalition of squabbling,

314
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,360
if fundamentally
like-minded Katy Perry fans.

315
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,720
And as for the RNC,

316
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,920
it showed that the Republican Party
doesn't seem to currently exist.

317
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,000
Because we didn't really get
a Republican convention this year.

318
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,680
There was a Cleveland-based
gathering of delegates,

319
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,840
featuring all of Trump's favorite
family members and Tiffany

320
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,760
and celebrities whose most
notable upcoming projects include

321
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,480
"The Emmy Awards In Memoriam
Reel"... probably.

322
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,080
Almost everything you would expect
from a GOP convention was absent.

323
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,680
Many prominent Republicans
chose to skip it,

324
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,560
as did both living
Republican former presidents.

325
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,320
And for the party of Reagan,
the tone was unusually negative.

326
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,960
Not only have our citizens
endured domestic disaster,

327
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,280
but they've lived through one
international humiliation

328
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,440
one after another !

329
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,920
What is he talking about ?

330
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,040
Only one major humiliation
from recent history comes to mind

331
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,640
and it's the one standing
behind that podium.

332
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,640
This left the Democrats
wide open to pick up the mantle

333
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,200
of "people who actually
like living here."

334
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,680
Don't let anyone ever tell you
that this country isn't great,

335
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,280
that somehow
we need to make it great again.

336
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,800
Because this right now is
the greatest country on Earth !

337
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,680
Yes !
The greatest country on Earth !

338
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,480
You hear that, Denmark ?
You go fuck yourself.

339
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,280
I don't care what
the World Happiness Index says.

340
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,520
Michelle Obama told me we're number
one and her arms make me feel safe.

341
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,960
The DNC felt like
the more patriotic occasion.

342
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,280
It featured America's greatest actress
dressed up like a plastic tablecloth

343
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,840
from the fourth of July,

344
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,360
and General John Allen
screaming at people.

345
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,720
To our enemies: we will pursue you
as only America can.

346
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,520
You will fear us.

347
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,320
And to ISIS and others,
we will defeat you.

348
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,720
Who are you shouting at ?
ISIS is not watching the DNC.

349
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,920
They watch "Braxton Family Values".
It's Thursday, fool.

350
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,640
That is a retired four-star
marine general

351
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,640
threatening vaguely enemies while
a crowd waves signs reading "USA !"

352
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
That is not something you expect
to see at a Democratic convention,

353
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,520
not because
Democrats aren't patriotic.

354
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,520
But because Republicans have
always done that louder and longer.

355
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,360
This whole two weeks
felt topsy-turvy.

356
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,920
It's no wonder that commentators
felt a little confused.

357
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,560
If you were a martian
and looked at these two conventions

358
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,840
and somebody asked you: "which
of the parties is the most patriotic ?"

359
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,880
You'd say the Democrats.

360
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:16,520
Okay, but if you were a martian and
asked which party seemed patriotic,

361
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,520
you would probably say:
"That's your question ?"

362
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,080
I'm literally an alien. Is there
nothing else you want to ask me ?

363
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,320
"How was your trip?"
for example

364
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,480
or "What was Tilda Swinton
like as a kid ?"

365
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,960
Usually, people's first question
for me is:

366
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,960
"Why is your penis made
of pure glowing white light ?"

367
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,720
The reason the Republicans
forgot to celebrate America this year

368
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,400
might be because they were too busy
celebrating Trump's claims

369
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,960
that he would fix whatever Trump
thinks is wrong with America.

370
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,840
Nobody knows
the system better than me.

371
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,600
Which is why
I alone can fix it.

372
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,880
When I take the oath
of office next year,

373
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,800
I will restore law
and order to our country.

374
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,880
I am your voice.

375
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,280
"I am your voice"
is actually a fair claim,

376
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,320
he does speak for some people.

377
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,000
Although you would hope
they would then react

378
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,040
the way most people do when
they hear their own voice:

379
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,360
"Shit, I don't actually sound like
that, do I ? That is horrifying."

380
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,640
The RNC taught us that a party
which used to be organized

381
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,520
around a set of shared principles,
is organized around one man.

382
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And given that that is the case, his
judgment is the only thing important

383
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,720
when considering
who to vote for in November.

384
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,280
I would like to show you
something he said recently.

385
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,920
He has clearly said countless awful
things throughout this campaign,

386
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,320
any of which would
disqualify any other candidate.

387
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,800
This week, he declined
to release his tax returns,

388
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,120
lied about getting a letter
from the NFL

389
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,560
agreeing the debates shouldn't
clash with football games,

390
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,320
called Angela Merkel a moron,

391
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,040
implied Brazil brought
Zika Virus on themselves

392
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,360
encouraged a foreign power's
hack of his political rival.

393
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,120
Two of those didn't happen
but you're not sure which two

394
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,960
and that's kind of the point,
isn't it ?

395
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:37,480
Because Trump said thousands
of crazy things,

396
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,160
each of which blunts
the effect of the others.

397
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,040
It's the bed of nails principle: if
you step on one nail, it hurts you.

398
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,000
If you step on a thousand nails, no
single one stands out, and you're fine.

399
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,600
That is how Trump has managed to
say anything in his campaign,

400
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,680
seemingly without consequences.

401
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,920
Even with that caveat,

402
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,920
his response when asked about that
speech from Khizr Khan, stands out.

403
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:11,400
I saw him. He was very emotional
and looked like a nice guy.

404
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,840
His wife, she was standing there,
she had nothing to say,

405
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,760
she probably maybe she wasn't allowed
to have anything to say, you tell me.

406
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,000
She was extremely quiet and it
looked like she had nothing to say.

407
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,880
For a start: his wife has explained
that she chose not to speak

408
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,080
because she gets upset when she
sees images of her dead son's face,

409
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,680
you fucking asshole.

410
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,920
But I'm sorry,
please continue.

411
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,920
He said you have sacrificed
nothing and no one.

412
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,040
Who wrote that ?
Did Hillary's scriptwriters write it ?

413
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,040
How would you answer ?
What sacrifices have you made ?

414
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,960
I've made a lot of sacrifices.
I work very hard.

415
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,720
I've created tens of thousands
of jobs, built great structures.

416
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,000
I've had tremendous success.

417
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,200
- Those are sacrifices ?
- Sure, I think they're sacrifices.

418
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,320
No !
No, they are absolutely not.

419
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,520
They are self-serving half-truths
from a self-serving half-man

420
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,640
who has convinced half the country
sacrifice is the same thing as success.

421
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,640
The main takeaway from these
two weeks is that, incredibly,

422
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,320
we may be on the brink of electing
such a sociopathic narcissist

423
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,960
that the simple presidential duty
of comforting the families of soldiers

424
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,240
may be beyond his capabilities.

425
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:47,640
I did not think that was a part of
the job that someone could be bad at.

426
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,840
And now, this.

427
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,200
Some more highlights from
the Democratic National Convention.

428
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,640
To hell with
Trump's American nightmare.

429
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,480
We believe in the American dream.

430
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,200
The right wing has thrown everything
at Hillary, not only the kitchen sink,

431
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:14,080
not only the stove, but the
refrigerator and the toasters, too.

432
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,680
She'll fight for the macro issues,
and those macaroni-and-cheese issues.

433
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,920
Put down your Pokemon Go
for just a second.

434
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,040
We're naming Donald Trump
to our Dirty Dozen list.

435
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,160
Dirty, dangerous, denying Donald.

436
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,480
Shade, boy, bye.

437
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,280
They threw her down in this very
campaign. This campaign.

438
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:42,080
But she won't stay throwed.
No, she ain't gonna stay throwed.

439
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,920
I haven't really gotten
the bolo tie look to catch on.

440
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,600
She was the first person to call me
when my second child was born.

441
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,760
I don't know
what that says about my family.

442
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,400
The Hillary I know, she loves HGTV

443
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,880
and she can devour buffalo wings
whether on a car, plane, or train.

444
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,640
- Bernie !
- Hillary.

445
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:14,920
It's healing time. It's hope time.
It's Hillary time. It's healing time.

446
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,040
It's hope time. It's Hillary time.

447
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,600
It's healing time.
It's hope time. It's Hillary time.

448
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
It's healing time.
It's hope time. It's Hillary time.

449
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,920
It's healing time. It's hope time.

450
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,720
You better listen to me,
I said she won't stay throwed.

451
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,480
That's our show,
see you next week, good night !

452
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,360
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER
