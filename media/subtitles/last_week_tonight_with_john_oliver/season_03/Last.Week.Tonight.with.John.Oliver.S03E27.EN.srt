00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,840
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,360
SEASON III
EPISODE 27

3
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,400
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver. Thanks for joining us.

4
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,840
And unfortunately, we must begin
yet again with the 2016 election.

5
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,760
Or: "I don't even know if I can
make it another two-and-a-half weeks."

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,840
"I've been drinking a lot and
frankly my family is worried, 2016."

7
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,280
The most-anticipated event of
this week was on Wednesday,

8
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,520
with the final debate of this
election season and possibly ever.

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,600
It was the candidates' last chance

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,720
to show that they can elevate
the tone of this campaign.

11
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,240
How did that go ?

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,240
Look, Putin from everything I see,
has no respect for this person.

13
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,240
He'd rather have a puppet
as president of the United States.

14
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,680
No puppet.
You're the puppet !

15
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,320
- You won't admit...
- No, you're the puppet.

16
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,360
That is a pretty childish tone.
"No, you're the puppet"

17
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,040
sounds like something teenage
Pinocchio would yell at Geppetto

18
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,040
before slamming his bedroom door:
"You're the puppet !"

19
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,200
"I wish I'd never been carved !"

20
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,240
I would love to say that that was
Trump's low point of the evening,

21
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,040
but there were so many more.

22
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,920
We have bad hombres here,
we're going to get them out.

23
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,080
Nobody has more respect
for women than I do. Nobody.

24
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,920
In the ninth month,
you can take the baby

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,760
and rip the baby out
of the womb of the mother.

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,240
- Let me translate that, Chris...
- You can't.

27
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,760
My social security payroll
contribution will go up,

28
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,520
as will Donald's, assuming he can't
figure out how to get out of it.

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,160
- We want replenish...
- Such a nasty woman.

30
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,760
Now, to be fair, the questions that
the moderator asked were:

31
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,600
"What is an offensive way
to describe Mexicans ?",

32
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,160
state an objective falsehood,
a nonexistent medical process,

33
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,520
mansplain in two words, incorrectly
name your favorite Janet Jackson song.

34
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,280
He kind of went five for five.

35
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,880
But the most notable moment
of all came when Trump was asked

36
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,520
whether given his constant claims
that this election is rigged,

37
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,840
he would accept
the results of the vote.

38
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,320
To which the easy and
only answer is "yes".

39
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,560
But he took a different path.

40
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,640
I'm not looking at anything now.
I'll look at it at the time.

41
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,880
You're not prepared now
to commit to that principle ?

42
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,680
I will tell you then.
I'll keep you in suspense.

43
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,160
What do you mean,
you'll keep us in suspense ?

44
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,480
This is a presidential election, not
an "American Idol" results show.

45
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,120
I'll tell you whether my followers
will plunge the country into anarchy

46
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,520
after the break.

47
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,880
After criticism, Trump appeared to walk
back his statement the next day,

48
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,240
before throwing in
a twist at the last moment.

49
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,240
I would like
to promise and pledge

50
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,720
to all of my voters and supporters

51
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,240
and to all of the people
of the United States,

52
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,040
that I will totally accept
the results

53
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,400
of this great and historic
presidential election...

54
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,400
... if I win.

55
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,080
You got us !

56
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,520
That's so funny 'cause we thought you
were going to say the rational thing

57
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,880
that would have put the
country at ease but instead,

58
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,600
you continued to destabilize
the foundations of our democracy.

59
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,320
That is a solid bit !

60
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,680
As we have discussed,
the odds of voter fraud are very slim.

61
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,160
A study found that out of the billion
plus votes between 2000 and 2014,

62
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,400
there were 31 credible instances
of voter impersonation.

63
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,240
By comparison, in 2009 alone,

64
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,160
there were 32 newborns
in the U.S. named Abcde.

65
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,560
We should be less worried
about voter fraud

66
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,920
than we should be about those
32 sets of parents voting.

67
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,440
Trump and Clinton didn't only share
the stage during the debate this week.

68
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,120
The following night, they were at
the Al Smith dinner in New York,

69
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,080
an annual fundraiser for
Catholic charities where

70
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,920
presidential candidates gently roast
themselves and one another.

71
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,520
This should've been an easy win
for Trump, because Clinton is,

72
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,520
to put it kindly,
less than side-splittingly hilarious.

73
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,600
And Trump is basically an insult
comic writ large.

74
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,800
It is hard to imagine a philanthropic
event he'd be better suited for

75
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,160
other than
a charity groping booth.

76
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:28,560
And yet, somehow,
he completely lost the room.

77
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,640
Hillary is so corrupt,

78
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,440
she got kicked off
the Watergate commission.

79
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,200
Here she is tonight in public,
pretending not to hate Catholics.

80
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,200
Everyone knows Hillary's
belief that it takes a village,

81
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,600
which only makes sense,
after all, in places like Haiti,

82
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,080
where she's taken
a number of them.

83
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,640
How are you blowing this ?
It's a charity roast !

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,040
Watch the face of the man
sitting next to him,

85
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,680
after that first joke.

86
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:26,560
It says something about how
horrifying Trump's speech was

87
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,280
that his expression is that of
someone who just realized:

88
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,080
"My God, I've been shot.
I've been shot."

89
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,480
Of all the negative things
you could, should

90
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,240
and are morally obligated
to say about Trump,

91
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,040
being unentertaining
is not one of them.

92
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,880
He's a born showman !

93
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,880
And that room couldn't have given
him more of a home field advantage.

94
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,040
This wasn't a town hall
or a debate:

95
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,160
it was a $3,000-a-plate
fundraising gala

96
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,960
at a moth-eaten Manhattan hotel
organized by the Catholic church,

97
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,360
a real-estate owning, male-dominated,
sex-scandal-plagued organization

98
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,000
with whom Trump shares a uniquely
unqualified interior decorator.

99
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,320
Look at the audience there.
White bow ties ?

100
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,600
They are dressed to play a game of
steerage-darts onboard the Titanic.

101
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,080
Terribly high-stakes,
steerage darts.

102
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,760
If you're not careful,
you could lose a dart.

103
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,680
But there is no better index of
just how badly he did than this.

104
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,320
People were really cringing
a lot of times with Trump.

105
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,400
I was sitting next to Henry Kissinger
and he said "this is not good".

106
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,280
It's true. Henry Kissinger
thought Trump bombed horrifically,

107
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,520
and Kissinger is the world's leading
authority on horrific bombings.

108
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,880
Despite the audible boos
during his speech,

109
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,000
Trump did not seem to be aware
of how badly he was doing.

110
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,880
Hillary believes
that it's vital to deceive the people

111
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,600
by having one public policy

112
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,680
and a totally different policy
in private.

113
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,320
I don't know who
they're angry at, Hillary, you or I.

114
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,640
It's you. They're angry at you !
And I'll tell you why.

115
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,840
You are treating a benefit for needy
children like open mic night

116
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,320
at Rascal McBigot's, Long Island's
fourth-best alt-right comedy club.

117
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,720
But Trump did so poorly

118
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,440
because the dinner is supposed
to involve selfdeprecation.

119
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,880
He is almost pathologically unable
to acknowledge any flaw or fault.

120
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,120
There was one revealing moment
in Wednesday's debate,

121
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,360
when Clinton
hit something of a nerve.

122
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,640
He didn't get an Emmy for his
TV program three years in a row.

123
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,960
- He tweeted the Emmys were rigged.
- Should have gotten it.

124
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,520
Of course
he wants an Emmy !

125
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,440
It's a woman, it's gold, and it's
proportionate to his tiny hands !

126
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,720
It's basically Trump's ideal mate !
And here's the problem:

127
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,040
it increasingly seems like,
if Donald Trump loses,

128
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,000
we are not going to get the concession
speech the country badly needs.

129
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,040
Because he is medically incapable
of accepting that he is a loser.

130
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,360
So we need to find a way for him
to give a concession speech

131
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,600
while he's still able to claim
that he won something.

132
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,800
I might have the answer here,
because I have a proposition:

133
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,080
let's bet
on the outcome of this election.

134
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,840
I will take the side that you win,
you take the side that you lose.

135
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,440
That way, if you lose,
you still win.

136
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,920
As for the stakes of the bet,

137
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,680
I have something
I know that you want.

138
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,680
She's so small, she's so shiny.

139
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,440
You don't even have
to take her furniture shopping !

140
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,160
Take the bet, Donald.
Take the fucking bet.

141
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,800
And now, this.

142
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,880
You'll never guess what
Chris Matthews' favorite movie is.

143
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,360
We'll be joined by NBC News
correspondent Chuck Todd,

144
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,520
who's in London
with the president.

145
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,520
Here's a clip from the great
movie Love Actually.

146
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,560
It's been brought to the fore
so many times in movies,

147
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,120
my favorite being Love Actually.

148
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,520
We still remember this scene and we'll
play it again, from Love Actually.

149
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,800
Like in that great, memorable
scene from Love Actually.

150
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,640
- Did you see Love Actually ?
- I did.

151
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,880
Every time I rewatch
Love Actually.

152
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,560
Everybody fell in love with
Colin Firth, in Love Actually.

153
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,000
One of my favorite movies,
Love Actually.

154
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,880
My favorite movie, Love Actually.
Love Actually.

155
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,760
That reminded me of Love Actually,
I've seen it about a million times.

156
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,520
Moving on. For our main story,
I would like to talk about drugs.

157
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,280
I already sound like
a middle-school health teacher

158
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,480
about to show a video like this.

159
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,200
The pattern
is generally the same:

160
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,760
take a lack of responsibility,
the inability to make right choices,

161
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,960
add to it ignorance, and top it off
with a desire for escapism and kicks.

162
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,120
The sum total is then found in the
bennies, the reefer, the pot needle.

163
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,520
Yes, the pot needle.

164
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,760
Now you may laugh, but that
film worked. Think about it.

165
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,360
When was the last time you saw
a pot needle ? Exactly.

166
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,000
America is now in the midst
of a new drug crisis

167
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,160
and it seems
no one is safe from it.

168
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,320
Laura, Charlie's owner, who asked
us not to use her last name,

169
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,760
says Charlie had to be
rushed to the vet.

170
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,600
You can't see the suspect throw
the drugs over the fence in the video,

171
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,360
but that's Charlie, and what she's
eating is a full bag of heroin.

172
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,480
You can't process the fact
that your dog ate heroin.

173
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,320
If she can't process it,

174
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,680
imagine how it must have felt
for her dog when it kicked in.

175
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,600
Who's a good boy ?
I'm a really good boy.

176
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,840
I'm the best boy.

177
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:34,080
Even that lighthearted local news
story had some chilling context.

178
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,320
Bishop runs the bark
and play where it happened.

179
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,640
He says it highlights
a bigger problem.

180
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,880
This heroin problem
here is ridiculous.

181
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,600
We find needles, we find everything
around here

182
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,000
and I can't let
my employees go outside.

183
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:56,280
That is terrifying. Although, rampant
heroin abuse near a doggie care center

184
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,560
is the first case that McGruff
is actually qualified to solve.

185
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,320
That is symptomatic of the fact that
America is facing an epidemic

186
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,280
of addiction to opioids, like
heroin and prescription painkillers.

187
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,760
As of 2015, an estimated
2.6 million Americans were addicted,

188
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,880
and they're involved in almost 30 000
overdose deaths a year in the U.S.

189
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,280
The prevalence of this problem
astonishes some people.

190
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,920
Listen to Donald Trump
up in New Hampshire.

191
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,280
They said the biggest single problem
here is heroin.

192
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,840
How does heroin work with these
beautiful lakes and trees

193
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,160
and all of the beautiful... it doesn't !

194
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,160
Yeah, it does though.
Heroin works basically everywhere.

195
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:47,120
Because it's heroin. It's not a cell
phone. Heroin has full coverage.

196
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,200
So tonight, we're going to look at one
of the major causes of this crisis:

197
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,880
prescription painkillers,
chemical cousins of heroin.

198
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,680
Around 75% of heroin users
started with a prescription opioid,

199
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,240
drugs like Oxycontin,
Vicodin and Percocet,

200
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,880
which some take recreationally
and others take as prescribed.

201
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,360
But however it starts,
it can get out of hand fast.

202
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,720
So, how many have moved
from prescription drugs to heroin ?

203
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,960
- Everybody.
- Heroin is so much more cheaper.

204
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,720
Once people became dependent
on painkillers,

205
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,040
they'd do almost anything
to get them.

206
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,760
One time, I was hurting so bad that
I ended up punching a 4x4

207
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:38,600
and breaking three fingers
to get pain meds from my doctor...

208
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,120
- You'd hurt yourself ?
- Absolutely.

209
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,040
I had nine teeth pulled out
of my head for prescriptions.

210
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,560
To get a prescription ?

211
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,720
I've been in groups where they've
taken bats to their wrists.

212
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,880
How many people do know someone
that's died of overdose from...

213
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,280
Everybody.

214
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,560
This is happening everywhere.
Odds are you probably know someone

215
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,720
who is struggling, or died
from an opioid addiction.

216
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,680
Some towns have been devastated.
Two months ago,

217
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,560
in and around Huntington,

218
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,640
28 overdoses occurred
in one five-hour span.

219
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,480
Given their risks, it's amazing how
freely doctors prescribed them.

220
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,000
There are a lot in circulation.

221
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,320
We have currently
nearly 250 million prescriptions

222
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,600
for opioids written every year.

223
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,840
That's enough for every adult to
have a bottle of pills and then some.

224
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,600
Holy shit.

225
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,120
Those bottles aren't
sitting on a shelf, unused,

226
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,560
like that bottle of wine
you are saving for a special occasion

227
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,440
that serves as a reminder that you
haven't had an event in four years

228
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,040
that was deserving
of getting fancy-drunk.

229
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,840
These pills are getting used, or
falling into the hands of others,

230
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,680
from those who are already
addicted to just bored teenagers.

231
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,480
How has this happened ?
As recently as the early nineties,

232
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,000
doctors were excessively wary
of prescribing opioids.

233
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,240
Back then, there was
a thing called opia-phobia.

234
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,240
A lot of healthcare professionals
did not want to prescribe opiates,

235
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,360
they thought the slightest amount,
you turn your patients into addicts.

236
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,680
Even people with stage four cancer
they were left to suffer.

237
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,880
Yes, opia-phobia. Which is not
to be confused with "Oprah-phobia"

238
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,960
the irrational fear
of screaming talk show hosts

239
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,120
giving you
a brand new Pontiac Sedan.

240
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,480
Oprah, I can't afford the taxes !
You haven't thought it through.

241
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,960
That level of under-treating pain
was a huge problem in itself.

242
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,560
Pain care advocates worked to
dispel some dangerous myths.

243
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,440
But in doing so,
they made a key mistake,

244
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,880
as you will see
right at the end of this clip.

245
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,200
The federal government said
that half of all surgery patients

246
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,680
suffer needlessly because doctors don't
pay enough attention to pain killer.

247
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,120
Health Secretary
Louis Sullivan talked about myths,

248
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,720
that pain builds character,
myth, he said.

249
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,360
That infants don't feel pain,
another myth.

250
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,640
That elderly patients have a higher
tolerance for pain

251
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,120
or that painkillers are
addictive, myths !

252
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,120
Okay...

253
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,440
First: of course babies feel pain,
how did we ever think otherwise ?

254
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,720
The fact that painkillers are
addictive was not a myth !

255
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,200
It's like a book of Greek mythology
with stories of Zeus,

256
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,400
Sisyphus, Oedipus and Yanni.

257
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,720
That last one is very real
and it cannot be dismissed.

258
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,720
A discussion
between the medical community

259
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,120
about the complexities of pain
treatment is important.

260
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,600
That discussion became dominated
by the pharmaceutical industry,

261
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,680
who started amplifying the message
that opioids should not just be used

262
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,480
for acute pain,
like that from cancer or surgery,

263
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,240
but for all sorts of pain
like arthritis and backaches.

264
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,840
Which makes sense as a motive
coming from the pharma industry.

265
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,720
End-of-life pain care
is a narrow business.

266
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,760
It's hard to make a lot of money
off of a product exclusively marketed

267
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,680
to people
who are close to death.

268
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,400
I don't know how Fox News even
does it. It's a mystery.

269
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,560
Volume, I guess.
But I don't know.

270
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,600
Within the pharma industry,
the loudest voice was Purdue.

271
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,440
In 1996, they released
the blockbuster drug OxyContin

272
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,120
and they marketed it
to doctors aggressively,

273
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,600
giving out swag like fishing hats,
swing-music CDs

274
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,440
bearing the slogan "swing in the
right direction with OxyContin",

275
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,400
and oxy-branded
stuffed plush toys,

276
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,240
and if you think we didn't get
hold of one of those,

277
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,600
you have never watched
this show before.

278
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,040
Because yes, here he is.
And yes, he is my new best friend,

279
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,200
and yes, his name is Harold.

280
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,320
Purdue, this is the perfect
choice of mascot.

281
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,600
Much like a gorilla, OxyContin
might seem appealing,

282
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,400
but if you're not careful,
it will tear your fucking life apart.

283
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,080
Won't you, Harold ?
Yes, he will.

284
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,960
Purdue distributed inspirational videos
like "I Got My Life Back",

285
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,520
seven patients whose lives were
turned around by OxyContin.

286
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,080
Since I've been on this new medication,
I have not missed one day of work

287
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,880
and my boss appreciates that.

288
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,760
Lauren is there every day.
I'm able to be very productive.

289
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:38,600
One of the things dear to my heart
and which I'm excited about

290
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,080
is the fact that I'm able to spend
time with my grandchildren.

291
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,760
It's amazing just to be able
to keep up with them

292
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,960
and not have to tell 'em
grandma can't play now,

293
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,640
grandma's hurting,
grandma's back hurts.

294
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,280
That's genuinely sweet,
and it's a powerful message.

295
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,280
"It makes time with your grandkids
more fun" could apply to any drug.

296
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,320
Grandpa's gonna take you to the
park, I'm gonna take you on the swings.

297
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,080
I'll push you real high,
we'll stay up all night,

298
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,720
I'll come up with inventions,
you're gonna write them down fast.

299
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,360
We're having quality time !

300
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:23,760
It wasn't just uplifting stories. Other
videos sought to reassure patients

301
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,040
who might've been nervous
about taking such a strong drug.

302
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,840
Less than one percent of patients
taking opioids become addicted.

303
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,480
Less than one percent !

304
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,640
I know it may seem like they are
pulling that number out of their ass,

305
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,560
but they actually pulled it out
of the "Letters to the Editor" section

306
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,920
of the New England
Journal of Medicine.

307
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,920
That paragraph is the whole thing.
It wasn't peer-reviewed,

308
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,280
and it was only about short-term
use of opioids in hospitals,

309
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,480
but it became the main source
for that one percent claim.

310
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,240
And letters pages are not
a solid source for information.

311
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,720
This month, a Pennsylvania
newspaper published a letter

312
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,840
featuring a man's question about
Hillary Clinton's fitness for office,

313
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,640
because "what if
that time of the month comes ?"

314
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,640
To which the obvious answer is,
one, she's 68,

315
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,680
and two, fuck you, maybe,
a little bit.

316
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,600
Even if doctors started noticing

317
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,720
that more than one percent of their
patients were getting addicted,

318
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,840
Purdue had a ready answer:
what if they're not ?

319
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,240
They had doctors on their payroll
like Alan Spanos,

320
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,400
who were happy to explain the helpful
new concept of "pseudo addiction".

321
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,640
I'll let him tell you about it.

322
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:52,360
Pseudo-addiction is when a patient
is looking like a drug addict

323
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,240
because they're pursuing pain relief.

324
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,960
So pseudo-addiction is relief-seeking
behavior mistaken as drug addiction.

325
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,240
That is so convenient.
That is like Chipotle going:

326
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,360
Have you heard of this fascinating
new thing called "pseudo-diarrhea" ?

327
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,640
It looks a lot like diarrhea,
but it's not diarrhea,

328
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,600
and the cure
may actually be more tacos.

329
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,640
Purdue's overall message of
a easy cure for pain was appealing,

330
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,960
especially for primary care doctors who
might have 15 minutes for a patient.

331
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,320
So it is no wonder that,
by the year 2000,

332
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,760
doctors were writing nearly six million
OxyContin prescriptions per year

333
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,240
and its sales were more
than even Viagra.

334
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,440
That was a drug that had the distinct
advantage of being sold by Bob Dole,

335
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,400
the red-hot late-'90s it boy.

336
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,200
Evidence started piling up that
it was riskier than promised,

337
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,280
with headlines like
"OxyContin abuse is increasing"

338
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,720
and
"OxyContin abuse called 'a plague'."

339
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,440
Or, as Purdue would call it,
a "pseudo-plague".

340
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,600
And even the stars of Purdue's
"I Got My Life Back" video

341
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,520
were not immune from this trend,
because a investigation discovered,

342
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,080
two out of the seven of them
died as active opioid abusers,

343
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,520
and that grandmother became
addicted and nearly lost everything.

344
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,120
I lost my house.
Yeah, I've lost cars.

345
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,440
I lost a lot. A lot.

346
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,880
I lost a lot to keep

347
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,680
the high and taking
that drug when I did lose my job.

348
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,120
Had I not lost my medical insurance,
or if I was to go to the mailbox

349
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,720
and I would find OxyContin,
I'd still be on it and I'd be dead.

350
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,840
Losing her health insurance
might have saved her life.

351
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,880
That is an irony so deep it would
vaporize Alanis Morissette

352
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,800
into a cloud of fucking steam.

353
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,480
I'm guessing you are
pretty angry at Purdue.

354
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,520
In 2007, they admitted
some responsibility

355
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,480
in a lawsuit so big,
it led the evening news.

356
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,760
Good evening. The maker
of a hugely popular painkiller

357
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,520
has some pain of its own.

358
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,040
The company and its top officers
will pay $634 million in fines

359
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,600
for lying to the public.

360
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,800
They fucked up if they had to pay
$600 million for misleading marketing.

361
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,360
You get a lot of leeway on that.

362
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,360
That's why Dunkin Donuts has
not yet been sued for:

363
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,880
"America runs on Dunkin",
when their real slogan should be:

364
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,280
"Sometimes
you can't find a Starbucks".

365
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,640
It wasn't just Purdue
pushing the envelope.

366
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,240
Cephalon paid a $444 million settlement
for over-marketing drugs,

367
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,480
and Insys has been investigated for
a drug they made containing fentanyl,

368
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,080
an opioid which can be 100 times
more powerful than morphine.

369
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,040
Their drug is only approved
for cancer patients.

370
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,720
Insys is accused of not just pushing
it for non-cancer patients,

371
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,960
but helping convince insurance
companies to pay for it.

372
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,800
And to do that they used
a particularly shady technique.

373
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,160
If you don't have cancer
and breakthrough cancer pain,

374
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,320
no insurance company
is gonna pay for this medication.

375
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,000
If you call up and you tell them
the patient doesn't have cancer,

376
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,240
it's denied.

377
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,240
Instead what were you doing ?

378
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,200
They would always ask does
the patient have cancer ?

379
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,560
- That's what we would say.
- You would say yes.

380
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,400
But I'm not saying yes, right ?
I would just say...

381
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,920
- Isn't that a yes ?
- That's what they did think.

382
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,840
I wasn't blatantly saying yes.

383
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:42,160
My God. Except everybody knows
"uh-huh" means yes.

384
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,120
If you go to thesaurus.com
and type in "uh-huh",

385
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,280
literally the first word that
comes up is "yes",

386
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,840
followed by "absolutely", "definitely",
"unquestionably" and "yep".

387
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,000
I should say that Purdue
and Cephalon's owner told us

388
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,960
that those practices were in the past
and Insys has denied wrongdoing

389
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,040
and didn't respond to our questions,
not even with a "nuh-uh".

390
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,120
But at a certain point,
the question has to become less

391
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,160
"what did we do wrong ?",
and more: "what do we do now ?"

392
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,080
These drugs are the most effective
solution for certain types of pain.

393
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,080
Many patients need them.
So we can't get rid of them.

394
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,640
We have to be more careful
about how they're prescribed.

395
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,480
And to their credit, the CDC issued
voluntary guidelines this year

396
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,040
suggesting doctors use non-opioid
therapies when possible,

397
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,480
and to start patients with a lower
dose and a shorter supply,

398
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,680
a technique that they call
"start low and go slow".

399
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,520
Which does sound good,
but also sounds like

400
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,120
how your creepiest high school
friend described cunnilingus.

401
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:55,240
Dude. Start low, go slow and
afterwards take her to Friendly's.

402
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,680
Chicks love root beer floats, dude.
They love them, dude.

403
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,160
Low and slow, dude.
Low and slow.

404
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,280
While that sounds great,

405
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,360
not all areas of the country have
access to alternative pain treatments.

406
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,520
It's easy to say, use some non-opioid
alternative, but in rural areas,

407
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,600
patients don't have access to physical
therapy and mindfulness meditation.

408
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,600
Insurance companies
won't pay.

409
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,080
And that is a big problem.
Because even in a rural area,

410
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:31,440
alternative pain treatments should be
as easy to find as Waffle Houses.

411
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,040
Which, like heroin, are hazardous to
your health and dangerously addictive.

412
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,920
It does not seem that
the pharmaceutical industry

413
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,720
is expecting major reversals
in opioid sales soon.

414
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,040
They're now marketing extra drugs
to fight one of opioids' side effects,

415
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,400
constipation.

416
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,160
If you need an opioid
to manage your chronic pain,

417
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:07,200
you may be so constipated it feels
like everyone can go except you.

418
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,560
You know painkillers are powerful
if people use them

419
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,400
despite the side effect:
"being jealous of a dog's butthole."

420
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,040
And that commercial
aired during the Super Bowl,

421
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,520
which means,
it is a big business,

422
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,640
and I can assume there was a reverse
commercial during the Puppy Bowl,

423
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,120
featuring a jealous dog
and a shitting man.

424
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,520
We cannot just work
to prevent future addicts,

425
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,680
we have to do more to help
the millions that already exist.

426
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,160
Means investment
in treatment programs,

427
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,880
as well as increasing the availability
of drugs like Naloxone,

428
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,760
used in a nasal spray to rescue
people from overdoses.

429
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,960
As this firehouse makes clear,
it is a tool they use with frequency.

430
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,280
Every single firefighter
has been trained on this.

431
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,280
- Yes.
- And has used it.

432
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:06,520
From the chief down. We tend to have
more overdoses than we do fires.

433
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,200
So it's a piece of equipment
we can't go without now.

434
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,840
Just like we have the hose.

435
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:17,360
Firefighters might be more likely
to use a nasal spray than a hose.

436
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,280
Which is really going to fuck up
those hot firefighter calendars,

437
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,640
because an overdose-reversing nasal
spray isn't quite as sexy.

438
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,520
It's still sexy,
but just not quite as sexy.

439
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,520
It is still sexy, though.
Just not quite. But still.

440
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,720
And that's not the point. The point
is, there is no one simple answer.

441
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,160
Not all opioid addicts will respond
to the same treatment.

442
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,600
Not all people will find
relief from alternative therapies.

443
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,440
This is going to take effort
and a significant investment.

444
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,760
It won't be cheap, it won't be quick,
and it won't be easy.

445
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,560
And it is hard not to be angry
at the drug companies like Purdue,

446
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,040
whose promise of cheap, quick,
easy pain solutions

447
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,920
helped put us in this mess.

448
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,960
While they may not be
solely responsible,

449
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,040
if you were to ask me if they bear
significant blame for greedy behavior,

450
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,320
which contributed to this massive
public health crisis,

451
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:16,200
I might not say yes, exactly, but I
would definitely say... Uh-huh.

452
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,240
Elected officials, whether at
the local, state, or federal level,

453
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:26,360
these are the people who make us
look like idiots for electing them.

454
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,280
Let's meet another in our series:
People Who Somehow Got Elected.

455
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,360
This week's person who somehow got
elected, Glenn Grothman.

456
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,600
U.S. representative
from Wisconsin's sixth district,

457
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,840
the picturesque home
to cheeseheads,

458
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,800
and that creepy prosecutor
from Making a Murderer.

459
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,880
Grothman was elected
to congress in 2014,

460
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,240
but before that, he spent 22 years
in the Wisconsin state legislature,

461
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,360
making his name as a fiscal
and social conservative.

462
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,200
Taking bold stances such as speaking
out against unequal pay law.

463
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,560
Senator Grothman said: "You could
argue money is more important to men."

464
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,560
"A guy in his first job, maybe because
they expect to be a breadwinner,"

465
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,200
"may be more money-conscious."

466
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,960
Yes, Glenn Grothman talks
like a character out of Mad Men

467
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,320
and dresses like a contestant
on 1987 episode of Jeopardy.

468
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,720
Which is not to say Glenn Grothman
does not support women,

469
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,880
he loves all of them,
even the single moms.

470
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,240
I know lot of gals who are having kids
out of wedlock and I love them.

471
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,480
I've been outside abortion clinics
and encouraged them.

472
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:35,520
See ? Would a man who hates women
talk to them outside abortion clinics

473
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,680
or end that same speech this way ?

474
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,960
Our country is not going to survive
if we continue this war on men !

475
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,800
But if there's one issue dear
to Glenn Grothman's heart, it's racism.

476
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,240
Or as he calls it...

477
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:56,080
This is one more example of screaming
rashism where obviously none exists.

478
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,600
The idea that somehow opponents
say it's rashist is ridiculous.

479
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,920
For some reason Grothman pronounces
this word, "rashism"

480
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,280
which is weird because he has no
problem making an "s" sound.

481
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,200
Governor Walker is going to be
given tech schools, the schools,

482
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,680
the prisons, the counties,
the cities, all less money.

483
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,600
And Grothman's obsession
with rashe is especially strange

484
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,560
given that his district
is so overwhelmingly white.

485
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,600
It wasn't just a location of the state
2015 Polka Hall of Fame awards,

486
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,480
it was also the birthplace
of OshKosh B'gosh,

487
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,600
the closest wardrobe equivalent to
dressing your child in an banjo.

488
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,400
That doesn't mean Grothman
can't link rashism to any story.

489
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,280
Take Planned Parenthood.

490
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,360
Given the rashist background
of Planned Parenthood

491
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,680
and not liking people who
are not white,

492
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,440
I wonder why Planned Parent likes to
do these sex-selective abortions

493
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,040
is disproportionally are done on
people of an Asian background.

494
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,720
Incidentally,
that's 100% falsh.

495
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,320
But that's just scratching the surface
of Grothman's rashe-bashed opinions.

496
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,760
He's also opposed to making
Martin Luther King Day a holiday.

497
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,800
The vast majority of African Americans,
as the vast majority of everybody,

498
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,760
isn't doing anything for Martin Luther
King on Martin Luther King Day.

499
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,720
Most employees who are off
are shopping at the mall,

500
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,440
maybe taking an extended vacation
over the weekend, let's be honest.

501
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,080
And that's not the only African
American holiday he opposes.

502
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,480
Senator Glenn Grothman isn't backing
down on his stance

503
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,720
that the holiday Kwanzaa, should
"die a quick death."

504
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,840
The underlying problem
is not enough TV types,

505
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,680
when they talk about Kwanzaa,

506
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,320
about the horrible, rashist,
violent past of its founder.

507
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,760
Grothman says Kwanzaa's
a holiday that:

508
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,240
"almost no black people
today care about."

509
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,520
And if you're wondering how he can
be so sure, he checked.

510
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:58,000
I spent some time interviewing
briefly, 20 black Americans

511
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,440
from either California or Arizona,
or people getting on airplanes,

512
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,600
and none of them
celebrated Kwanzaa,

513
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,800
so I don't think Kwanzaa's important
to the average African American.

514
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,280
That's a flawed study, published
in the New England Journal

515
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,640
of Harassing Strangers Who
Are Just Trying to Board a Plane.

516
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,520
Glenn Grothman knows, whether
it's African Americans at airports,

517
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,120
or women at abortion clinics,
everyone's entitled his insane opions.

518
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,520
And that's why it's so remarkable
that Glenn Grothman is a politician

519
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,360
who somehow got elected.

520
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,560
That's our show. Thanks for watching.
See you next week. Good night !

521
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,080
