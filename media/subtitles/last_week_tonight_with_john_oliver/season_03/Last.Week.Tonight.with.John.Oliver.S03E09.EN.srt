00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,000
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,240
SEASON III
EPISODE 9

3
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,640
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,200
Thank you so much for joining us.
Time for a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,680
And we begin in Russia.
The real Borscht belt.

6
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,600
Russia this week held a beloved
annual tradition.

7
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,920
Vladimir Putin is hosting
his annual call in show right now.

8
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,480
More than 2 million questions:
from Syria to the Russian economy.

9
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,120
Yes, Vladimir Putin took questions
for nearly four hours on TV.

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,720
And we can all think of a few
questions we'd like to ask him,

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,520
like "have you ever blinked ?"

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,360
and "do you consider yourself
more of a Miranda or a Charlotte ?"

13
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,360
But the actual questions
and answers were truly amazing,

14
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,840
such as when he was asked who
he would save from drowning first,

15
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,840
the president of Turkey
or the president of Ukraine.

16
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,200
If someone is determined to drown,
you can't save them.

17
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,360
I think we can take
from that response

18
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,680
that Vladimir Putin
would be the world's worst lifeguard:

19
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,240
"You have chosen to drown, my friend.
For you, there is nothing I can do".

20
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,480
Putin also answered questions
submitted by children,

21
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,880
like this one
from an 11-year-old girl.

22
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,040
What 3 wishes would you make

23
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,120
if you were to catch
a wish delivering magic goldfish ?

24
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,680
The magic goldfish question.
That should be easy.

25
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,360
For your 3 wishes
you pick ice cream forever,

26
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,160
invisibility,
and then unlimited wishes.

27
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,320
But, but Putin
went a very different way.

28
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,360
Okay, three wishes.
I have to think.

29
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,680
You know, basically,
we shouldn't really rely on...

30
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,320
miracles.

31
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,120
Even during the soviet period,
we had this song:

32
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,480
"Nobody will help us,"

33
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,920
"either a king nor a hero,
we have to do everything ourselves".

34
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,440
Two things there:
first, we all had that song.

35
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,640
It's called the collected works
of Bruce Springsteen.

36
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,320
And second: this is the most amazing
TV show ever.

37
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,880
They should put this
on much more often.

38
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,600
I would watch Vladimir Putin
crushing children's dreams every week.

39
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,680
This week on
"Putin Says The Darndest Things":

40
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,920
Putin tells a child his grandfather

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,680
isn't watching from above
but is rather rotting in the ground.

42
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,080
But for now
let's move on to the UK.

43
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,120
Where 2 000 years of civilization
led to this face.

44
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,960
Last week,
we discussed the fact...

45
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,640
It's hurtful
when you clap at that.

46
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,080
We discussed the fact that
David Cameron was revealed

47
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,880
to have a family connection
to an offshore company

48
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,200
in the Panama Papers.

49
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,200
He faced questions in parliament,
and one member, Dennis Skinner,

50
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,720
brought up a conversation
that they'd had years ago.

51
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,800
And he closed with an explosive
piece of name-calling.

52
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,800
I didn't receive
a proper answer then,

53
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,200
maybe dodgy Dave
will answer it now !

54
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,680
Shit ! "Dodgy Dave !"
Cameron just got burned,

55
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,120
or as we say in England, boiled
for too long and served anyway.

56
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,480
Now, that comment set off
a spectacular chain of events.

57
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,880
The commons speaker,
John Bercow,

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,240
tried to calm everything down
in a quintessentially English manner.

59
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,920
Order.

60
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,440
Order.

61
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,000
I must ask the honorable gentleman...
Order !

62
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,280
I don't require any assistance
from some "junior minister !"

63
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,240
Absurd proposition !

64
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,640
That is the absolute height
of Englishness:

65
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,280
yelling at everyone to be orderly

66
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,120
and then condescendingly
mocking their status.

67
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,680
He then demanded
that skinner rephrase his remarks.

68
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,560
I can't reasonably ask the prime
minister to answer the question.

69
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,280
He has to withdraw that word
and think of another.

70
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,960
Sorry ?

71
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,240
I think he knows the word
beginning with "d" and ending in "y"

72
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,080
that he inappropriately used.

73
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,840
Now if I were Skinner, I would
have spent the rest of the session

74
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,520
just guessing words that started
with a "d" and ended with a "y".

75
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,000
"Is it dinghy ? No ?
Dignity ? No ? Deadly ! No ?".

76
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,120
"Dilly dally ? Hold on. Get me
a dictionary. Is it dictionary ?"

77
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,480
But Skinner refused,
which led to this amazing moment.

78
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,840
I order the honorable member
to withdraw from the house,

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,360
for the remainder
of this day's sitting.

80
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,800
He's used to this.

81
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,080
And that, ladies and gentleman
is English politics in a nutshell.

82
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,080
An 84-year-old man
just got sent from the room

83
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,040
like a naughty child who just called
his sister a "shithead" at dinner.

84
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,520
I'm so proud.

85
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,760
And finally this week: Turkey.
A country, a bird,

86
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,760
and the meanest thing
you could call someone in 1956.

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,640
Turkey's leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan,
caused a big stir in Germany.

88
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,880
Chancellor Angela Merkel
has accepted a request to prosecute

89
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,760
a comedian who mocked the Turkish
president on German television.

90
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,160
Erdogan had said
he wanted to take legal action

91
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,720
because this comedian
read a poem on air

92
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,600
that made very strong remarks
against Erdogan.

93
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,800
He's wants to lock someone up
over a poem ?

94
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,400
Why doesn't he do what the rest of us
do about poetry: listen to it politely,

95
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,680
because it's how Sarah
has chosen to cope with the divorce.

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,560
If you are wondering how an insulting
poem can be against the law,

97
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,920
it turns out, Erdogan may have dug up
a 19th-century German law stating,

98
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,360
"anyone who is guilty of an insult
to a sovereign or regent of a state"

99
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,640
"shall be punished
by imprisonment".

100
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,800
And for the record:
let me just say,

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,320
I'm very glad America
does not have a similar law,

102
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,720
or I would be in
a maximum-security prison.

103
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,040
And I would not thrive there.

104
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,880
But Angela Merkel
is in a bit of a bind here,

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,600
because clearly,
this is a free-speech issue.

106
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,760
But the problem is,
Erdogan is critical to Europe's plan

107
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,080
for processing
migrants and refugees.

108
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,560
And it seems he has
an incredibly thin skin.

109
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,880
For Recep Tayyip Erdogan
satire is no laughing matter.

110
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,440
Since he became president in 2014

111
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,760
almost 2 000 cases have opened
for insulting the president.

112
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,600
It's true: nearly 2 000 legal cases
have been opened since he took office.

113
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,360
That's more than three a day.

114
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,600
And some of these cases
have been unbelievably petty.

115
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,960
In October,
a physician lost his job

116
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,160
and now faces a two-year prison
sentence for sharing a meme

117
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,920
suggesting Erdogan's facial
expressions resemble Gollum's.

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,280
Which, by the way, they just do !

119
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,760
That's not a criticism, it's not even
a joke, it's just a biological fact !

120
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,840
Last April, a journalist received
a suspended prison sentence

121
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,200
simply for "liking" a Facebook
post that insulted Erdogan.

122
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,880
And "liking" something on Facebook
should never be a crime !

123
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,000
Unless maybe you "like"
a co-workers beach photo at 3-am.

124
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,080
That is the one exception
because that is creepy.

125
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,000
And look:
Erdogan is the one at fault here.

126
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,440
He makes it way too easy
to make fun of him.

127
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,240
For example, in 2014, he gave
an interview in which he said this !

128
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,640
You can see that what Israel
does to Palestine, to Gaza right now,

129
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,080
has surpassed
what Hitler did to them.

130
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,840
Holy shit !
That is very offensive to Israel,

131
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,800
and honestly:
it's a little offensive to Hitler.

132
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,120
Who has to be thinking:
"Are you fucking kidding me ?"

133
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,120
"What do I have to do ?"

134
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,960
And that same year, he caused
a bit of a stir with this remark...

135
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,960
You cannot bring women
and men into equal positions.

136
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,040
That is against nature.

137
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,000
That statement is bad enough,

138
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,520
but he said it at an international
conference for women.

139
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,200
The only way that could have been
any worse is if he'd then said,

140
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,840
"but that's enough of me,"

141
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,680
"please welcome Grammy winning
recording artist Chris Brown !"

142
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,280
"You're welcome, ladies !
Chris Brown !"

143
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,560
And when Erdogan tried
to smooth things over after that,

144
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,360
it didn't go so great.

145
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,320
Erdogan did try to offer
a compliment of sorts,

146
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,920
he says he used to kiss his mother's
feet because they smelled of paradise.

147
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,720
Even at an international
foot fetishist convention

148
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,760
"my mom's feet smell like paradise",
is going to get you some weird looks.

149
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,360
Erdogan is clearly
not a pleasant individual,

150
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,440
which is why it's so hard
to be sympathetic when you see

151
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,880
this footage of him having
his balls stomped on by a horse.

152
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,640
We've shown you that footage before,
and we'll probably show you it again.

153
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,000
Because the point is, Erdogan, if you
are so anxious not to be mocked,

154
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,160
try not suppressing speech
in your country and others,

155
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,880
and generally acting in ways

156
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,480
that make everyone want to see you
get kicked in the balls.

157
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,920
And now, this !

158
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,880
What in God's name is still happening
at WCBS 2 news at 11 ?

159
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,680
High heel self defense,
tonight at 11.

160
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,440
- Inside a dog's mind, tonight at 11.
- Ghost rest stops, tonight at 11.

161
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,920
Freeze yourself fabulous,
tonight at 11.

162
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,520
- Big bucks in bags.
- Younger eyes.

163
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,800
- Text walking.
- The digital breakup.

164
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,320
- Digital amnesia.
- Digital anxiety.

165
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,720
- Digital dentistry.
- Dry drowning.

166
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,080
- Water overdose.
- What's in the water ?

167
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,560
- What's in your wine ?
- What's in the box ?

168
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,760
- Keyless danger.
- Dog danger.

169
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,280
- Danger underground ?
- The she shed.

170
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,480
- The man flu.
- Dudeoir.

171
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,880
- Patch me pretty.
- Summer sadness.

172
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,400
- Spiked spices.
- Sick of food.

173
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,560
Are beards bad ?
Tonight at 11.

174
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:20,600
Moving on.
Our main topic tonight is lead.

175
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,840
The most dangerous thing
in Led Zeppelin's name,

176
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,920
and I will remind you:
the other thing was "Zeppelin".

177
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,560
Now, we've heard a lot
about lead over the last year,

178
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,200
due to the horrific events
in Flint, Michigan.

179
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,520
Flint's tap water was laced
with dangerous levels of lead.

180
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,560
The state knew about it
and did nothing.

181
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:46,240
There are 200 children under 6
in Flint with elevated blood levels.

182
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,520
9 000 children have been exposed.

183
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,920
Flint has become a city
whose very name evokes disaster,

184
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,800
like Benghazi or Waco
or Smurf Village.

185
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,680
Never forget.
Never forget what happened there.

186
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,080
Never forget !

187
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,560
Flint was a perfect storm
of incompetence from start to finish.

188
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,840
And the crisis began when the city
switched water sources,

189
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,320
a decision
which was commemorated thusly.

190
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,000
3... 2... 1...

191
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,680
Here's to Flint !

192
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,480
It's weird to see people make a toast
as they essentially drink poison.

193
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,600
You'd expect to hear something like,
"I'll see you all in hell !"

194
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,240
or "The mother ship is coming
and soon we will all ascend !"

195
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,680
That water source corroded the pipes,
leached lead into the drinking water.

196
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,920
And with all the bureaucratic
clusterfuckery involved,

197
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,680
politicians in Washington
were lining up to be vocally outraged.

198
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,440
We've got children
that have been harmed

199
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,840
and yet we're sitting here
equivocating over words

200
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,520
that may or may not
establish blame.

201
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,240
The safety
and well being of our citizens

202
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,600
is not a republican or a democrat
or an independent issue.

203
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,000
It's a human issue.

204
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,640
We're not some third world country
where 100 000 people

205
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,360
who get poisoned
for long periods of time.

206
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,200
There is one poison that thousands
of Americans should consume

207
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,040
and that is
Mountain Dew Code Red.

208
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,440
The most delicious way
of contracting red poisoning !

209
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,200
That is horrific !

210
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,160
We all care about lead in Flint now,
which is great.

211
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,360
Unfortunately,
the problem is not just in Flint.

212
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,120
A USA Today Network report
found lead contamination

213
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,440
in almost 2 000 additional water
systems spanning all 50 states.

214
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,320
And we can't act like it's not there,
the way we all pretend

215
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,200
that the public swimming pool
is not three percent child urine.

216
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,560
And that's generous, by the way.
And if you're thinking,

217
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,560
"We should rip out
every lead pipe in the country,"

218
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,520
it's not quite as easy as that.

219
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,120
There are an estimated 7,3 million
lead service lines around the country,

220
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,640
and we don't even know
where many of them are.

221
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,480
And if we did a partial solution,
that could increase lead in water.

222
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,760
But perhaps more importantly,
even if we did replace all lead pipes

223
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,120
that still wouldn't come close
to stopping lead poisoning,

224
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,560
as one lead activist
reassuringly puts it.

225
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,640
Kids are not going to get poisoned
from a water fountain,

226
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,720
they're gonna get poisoned
from paint in their homes.

227
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,560
I like how that starts off
sounding reassuring,

228
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,640
but ends
up even more terrifying.

229
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,120
It's like saying: "That boa
constrictor isn't going to bite you."

230
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,840
"It's going to crush you
to death with its body,"

231
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,160
"and then swallow you whole
because that's what it does."

232
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,960
But she is right. The biggest threat
of lead poisoning to children

233
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,760
does not come from water, it comes
from ingesting lead paint dust.

234
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,480
There are an estimated 2,1 million
homes all around the country

235
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,040
that contain both a lead dust hazard,
and a child under six.

236
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,520
CDC estimates over 500 000 children
have elevated blood lead levels.

237
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,960
And that's terrible !

238
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,360
Lead is almost as much of a scourge
in young children's homes

239
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,840
as Frozen merchandise.

240
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,240
Why do you need three Olafs
and a singing Elsa, McKenzie ?

241
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,440
Let "Let it Go" go.

242
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,560
And if you're thinking
at this point,

243
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,080
"How big a deal
is a little lead dust, anyway ?"...

244
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,200
It's a big fucking deal.

245
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,160
How potent is lead ?

246
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,960
A child can be poisoned
by 10 milligrams of pure lead.

247
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,400
To give you an idea
of what a small amount that is,

248
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,360
this spoonful
contains about 4 000 milligrams.

249
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,080
We know ingesting
small amounts of lead dust

250
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,360
can lead to brain damage
and even death.

251
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,280
Maybe don't say "death" in that
jolly tone over the photo of a baby.

252
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,320
It is true that there is
no safe level of lead.

253
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,680
It's so dangerous, you shouldn't let
a little bit of it inside you,

254
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,200
much like heroin,
or Jeremy Piven.

255
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,560
Even low-level exposure
can lead to irreversible damage

256
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,200
like lower IQs, anti-social
behavior and reduced attention span.

257
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,320
The dangers are so severe
that 20 years ago,

258
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,040
Sesame Street produced a video
to teach kids how to deal with lead.

259
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,240
Let's go everybody !
From the top.

260
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,120
Wash your hands before you eat.

261
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,000
Stay away from peeling paint.

262
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,760
Enough ! I've had it !

263
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,920
Who do you people think
you are, anyway ? The lead police ?

264
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,880
We are the lead police...

265
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,520
It's a close call,
but as Police songs go,

266
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,400
the possibility of being poisoned
by lead is still less terrifying

267
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,080
than Every Breath You Take.

268
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,160
Every breath I take,
you'll be watching me ?

269
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,720
That's a crime. You're stalking me,
Gordon. You're a stalker.

270
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,720
That video was made 20 years ago.
It's enough to make you wonder,

271
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,040
if lead paint is so dangerous,
why is there still so much of it

272
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,840
in houses where kids live ?

273
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,760
Good question. Many countries banned
the use of lead paint in the 1920s.

274
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,000
So we knew it was dangerous.
But instead of joining them,

275
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,040
America decided to put
lead basically everywhere.

276
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:49,240
And humble lead plays its part
in preserving and protecting buildings

277
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,760
in the form of white lead for wooden
structures and red lead for steel.

278
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,120
Humble lead ? It's a naturally
occurring element,

279
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,120
not Meryl Streep's
Oscar speech.

280
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,600
If we are assigning
personality traits to metals,

281
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,320
why stop with humble lead ?

282
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,760
How about passionate zinc,
free-spirited copper,

283
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,160
and extremely racist tin ?

284
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,520
And it wasn't just
newsreels promoting lead.

285
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,480
The lead industry reassured us
it was safe, releasing things

286
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,480
like this coloring book inviting you
to the "Dutch Boy's lead party"

287
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,600
which sounds like the worst sex
club in all of Amsterdam.

288
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:34,040
Even when the government
got serious about banning lead,

289
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,480
the lead industry did not go down
without a ridiculous fight.

290
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,200
Here is the head of a lead
industry trade group,

291
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,280
pushing back against
evidence that lead was dangerous.

292
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,320
If you look
at a total national profile,

293
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,480
we have never been healthier,
we have never lived longer.

294
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,200
Must be something
that we're doing right.

295
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,040
What ? He's basically saying:

296
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,440
"it can't be bad,
I turned out fine !"

297
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,200
The number-one argument made
by people who did not turn out fine.

298
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,440
It's like when
your uncle says:

299
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,200
"I had my first beer at ten
and I turned out okay."

300
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,440
But did you, Uncle Stu ?
Did you though ?

301
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,920
Your dinner last night
was 23 croutons dipped in frosting.

302
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,480
And that is not "turned out fine"
behavior. Make a change, Uncle.

303
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,040
There was plenty of hard evidence
showing that childhood lead exposure

304
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,640
was harmful, due to a study
by Dr. Herbert Needleman.

305
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,280
In the late 1970s
Dr. Needleman studied the baby teeth

306
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,280
of healthy schoolchildren
in two Boston suburbs.

307
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,040
When we looked at the data,

308
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,600
we found that children who
had high lead in their teeth,

309
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,440
but who had never been identified
as having any problems with lead,

310
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,360
had lower IQ scores, poorer language
function and poorer attention.

311
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,840
That's right: it's time you knew,
children: there is no tooth fairy.

312
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,640
Your baby teeth were all taken
away by Dr. Herbert Needleman.

313
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,160
The fairy thing
we knew would creep you out.

314
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,240
You should be thanking that man.
Because thanks to studies like his,

315
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,960
America started regulating and
removing lead from our environment,

316
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,200
resulting in a graph of child blood
lead levels that looks like this.

317
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,920
Lead paint was banned here

318
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,480
and leaded gasoline was phased
out all through here.

319
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,040
So getting rid of lead in paint and
gas was a major public health victory.

320
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,240
You know that 18-year-old intern
in your office who thinks he's smart ?

321
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,760
He probably is, because he was born
after America's lead epidemic.

322
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,680
You got lucky, Sawyer.
Now go get my coffee.

323
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,120
Even though we cut back on the
amount of new lead into the world,

324
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,320
we were still left with all the lead
in our pipes and on our walls.

325
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,800
We agreed it was a problem, the
cost of getting rid of it was high.

326
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,400
In 2000, the estimated cost for
testing for, and then removing lead

327
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,600
from old housing stock
was $16.6 billion per year,

328
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,160
every year,
for the next decade.

329
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,960
Which is the sort of figure

330
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,440
that turns the government into
parents with a sick family dog:

331
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,360
I know we said we'd do
anything to make this better.

332
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,880
But we got an estimate from the vet,
and...

333
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,160
Do you know that in doggie heaven,
every meal is hotdogs ?

334
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,760
Don't you think Bandit would
like to go live there ? I do.

335
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,760
Nobody expected the government
to pick up that full tab.

336
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,200
That same report
even ran an estimate

337
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,800
of what it would cost if the
government used "interim controls"

338
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,600
like sealing lead paint in,
or periodic cleanings

339
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,800
and only did that in homes
of families with low incomes.

340
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,080
And that cost came out
to just $230 million per year.

341
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,560
Which sounded lower
and therefore better.

342
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,280
Unfortunately and amazingly
we have never funded it at that level.

343
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,880
The main program to abate
lead paint in housing,

344
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,520
HUD's lead hazard
control program,

345
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,800
has never been appropriated
funding above $176 million.

346
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,640
It's been steadily
going down since 2003,

347
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,400
and this year, we've allocated
just $110 million.

348
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,240
A little more than Americans spent
to go see Ride Along 2.

349
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,560
A movie which, incidentally,
the New York Post described as:

350
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,680
"as funny as lead poisoning."

351
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,840
It's amazing !

352
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,560
That reduction is not because we were
done removing lead from housing.

353
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,800
There are still millions of homes
with lead paint hazards in them.

354
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,080
HUD were only able to fund
half the applications

355
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,960
for lead abatement
grants they received last year.

356
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,840
Many Americans still live
in homes with lead in them.

357
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,320
It is often the groups least able
to do anything about it.

358
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,480
When people in the lower
socioeconomic levels

359
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,080
go into older housing,
less well taken care of housing,

360
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,640
where there may be absentee
landlordsý

361
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:13,200
As a result, are more liable
to have lead paint

362
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,960
that has not been
taken off the walls.

363
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,560
Of course.
If you are in that situation,

364
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,440
you probably can't shop
around for a new apartment.

365
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,800
Most people with lead problems
are stuck in homes they can't leave,

366
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,520
trying to avoid danger,
which may sound familiar

367
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,400
because it's the plot of every
horror movie ever made.

368
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,600
While lead abatement is expensive,
it's cost effective.

369
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,600
Studies show a correlation between
lead levels and a fall in crime.

370
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,920
When you combine it with lower medical
bills, and greater economic activity,

371
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,680
one study found that each dollar
spent on lead paint hazard control

372
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,920
would bring back at least
17 dollars in societal benefits.

373
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,840
Which is great,
although the cost savings

374
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,680
do rank a distant third on my list
of reasons to not poison children.

375
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,280
Number one and two still being:

376
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,080
it's poison
and they're fucking children.

377
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,520
You would think that congress
would do more to fight lead poisoning.

378
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,840
How angry they were about those
kids who got poisoned in Flint !

379
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,800
We've got children
that have been harmed.

380
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,160
It's a human issue, it's an American
issue that affects Americans' lives.

381
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,960
We're not some third world country
where you get 100 000 people

382
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,120
who get poisoned !

383
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,400
They seemed so concerned !

384
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,440
Which is what,
which is what makes it...

385
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,040
That's what makes it so
frustrating that last year,

386
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,400
all of those men voted for a bill
that would have reduced

387
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,440
the already-low funding for HUD lead
abatement programs by $35 million,

388
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,800
amounting to a 32 percent cut.

389
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:03,640
If you cut funding like that,
more children might get poisoned !

390
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,840
Now, the good news is,
those cuts didn't go through.

391
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,640
The bad news is
the funding stayed flat.

392
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,720
The other two primary agencies
that work on lead-related issues

393
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,760
have had funding problems
in recent years, as well.

394
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,440
Which makes no sense,
because I thought poisoned children

395
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,720
were something we were all
justifiably outraged by.

396
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,880
This problem was obvious
enough twenty years ago

397
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,960
for Sesame Street
to address it.

398
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,840
Since we still have this problem,
it's clearly time to address it again.

399
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,520
- Hi, Elmo ! Hi, Rosita !
- Hi, Mr. Oliver !

400
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,360
It has been two decades

401
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,760
since Sesame Street
taught kids how to avoid lead dust.

402
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,280
You two do not look
like you've aged a day !

403
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,840
Thank you, Mr. Oliver !
I moisturize !

404
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,800
Very nice !

405
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,800
You know Mr. Oliver,
Elmo has been hitting the gym.

406
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,800
I can see, you're ripped.
You both look great.

407
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,760
I'm here to say, a lot of places
still contain lead paint.

408
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,200
- What can we do about that ?
- That's a good question.

409
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,840
We need to care more than
we currently do,

410
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,640
so that we spend
enough money on containing it.

411
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,000
- Elmo has money in his piggy bank.
- That's nice.

412
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,280
How much have you got in there,
Elmo ? How much is it ?

413
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,560
- One dollar and seventy-six cents.
- Okay, that's a start.

414
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,360
Elmo did it !
Elmo saved the day !

415
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,760
No, Elmo,
you didn't actually do it.

416
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,800
We're gonna need a lot more,
of that money.

417
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,040
Probably hundreds of millions
of dollars every year.

418
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,080
-Ay mama !
-Yeah. That's a lot.

419
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,080
- A hundred million is a big number.
- Sure.

420
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,640
Let's count to a hundred million:
one, two, three, four, five...

421
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,360
We do not have time for that.
The problem here is,

422
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,920
people are worried that lead
is too expensive a problem to fix.

423
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,920
- That's ridiculous !
- Oscar. How ya doing ?

424
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,400
How ya doing, Oscar ?

425
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,560
How can anyone say
it's too expensive ?

426
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,360
According to a study
in environmental health perspectives,

427
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,800
every dollar we spend
on lead paint hazard control

428
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,720
produces returns
of at least 17 to 1 !

429
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,760
An astonishing
level of economic insight

430
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,280
coming from someone
who lives in a trashcan.

431
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,200
This can is rent-controlled.
I've had it since the '60s.

432
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,320
I know it's cost-effective,
people aren't willing to do it.

433
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,160
I guess it just seems too hard.

434
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,960
Just because something's hard,
doesn't mean you shouldn't try !

435
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,520
- Should we sing a song about it ?
- Do we have to ?

436
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:05,360
Lead's a really big problem,
seems like it's everywhere,

437
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,480
we can do more to fix it,
but first we all have to care.

438
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:16,880
Things do tend to get done, if you
just decide you want to do them.

439
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,040
Can you think of another
example where that's true ?

440
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,400
- I can !
- You go.

441
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,840
I wanted to tie my shoes,
I could never do it right,

442
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,680
then I decided to practice it,
and now they're all knotted tight.

443
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,360
They are ! You did it !

444
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,800
You have to have an
interest in the outcome,

445
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,920
and you'd be amazed
at what you can do.

446
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,520
Oscar, you take a verse !

447
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,800
Yes my trashcan is messy,
people stop and they stare.

448
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,960
I suppose I could clean it up,
the problem is: I don't care.

449
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:01,560
That is unsurprisingly negative !
That's actually a fair representation

450
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,280
of our institutional problems,
so there you go.

451
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,240
- I helped you prove your point ?
- Yes, Oscar, you actually did !

452
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:18,080
Lead is still all around us,
our pipes, our walls and our air,

453
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:24,000
we should do to more to contain it,
but first we all have to care.

454
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,320
Yes, first, we all have to care.

455
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,520
That's our show, thank you
so much watching,

456
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,800
see you next week,
goodnight !

457
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,160
Thank you so much, guys !
Thank you, Rosita !

458
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,320
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

459
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,240
END OF EPISODE 9,
SERIES III
