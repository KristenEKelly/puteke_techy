LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,640
Season III
Episode 6

3
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,240
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !
Thank you so much for joining us.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,120
I'm John Oliver.
Time for a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,880
And we begin in Brazil.

6
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,480
The country with the second
most valuable Amazon on earth.

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,840
Brazil is facing numerous problems,

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,560
from the Zika virus
to a struggling economy.

9
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,240
And it was plunged
into political turmoil.

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,720
Hundreds of thousands of Brazilians
are taking to the streets

11
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,440
calling for the impeachment
of their president Dilma Rousseff.

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,720
People here are saying
they are tired of being lied to.

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,400
And they are particularly tired
of this very deep economic recession.

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,720
The protesters want to forcibly
remove their president.

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,520
And as Brazilians know well,

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,800
you don't want to remove something
slowly and methodically.

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,120
The Brazilian legislature is moving
to impeach President Rousseff.

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,080
Although they may not be
in a great position to judge,

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,360
given that 60 percent of them
face criminal charges of some kind,

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,040
ranging from electoral fraud
to homicide.

21
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,280
The Brazilian legislature
potentially contains

22
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,920
40 percent fewer criminals per capita
than the Brazilian prison system.

23
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,640
Rousseff's latest trouble
concerns Lula da Silva

24
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,040
and his connection to the ongoing
investigation into bribes

25
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,800
and kickbacks at Petrobras,
Brazil's state-run oil company.

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,960
And is there ever a state-run
oil company that is not corrupt ?

27
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,400
The only two words that are more
inherently suspicious than "state-run"

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,600
are "oil company",
except that's not actually true.

29
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,080
The list of suspicious two-word
phrases goes: open marriage,

30
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,720
well-spoken, homeopathic remedy,
staterun, father-daughter,

31
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,200
oil company, and discount sushi.

32
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,600
But Lula da Silva is facing charges
connected to Petrobras.

33
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,560
While he claims
they were politically motivated,

34
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,040
Rousseff didn't calm things down when
she made a surprise staffing choice.

35
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,960
Former President Lula

36
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,200
is now going to be serving
as Chief of Staff for Dilma Rouseff.

37
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,480
If he is in the cabinet,
he is protected from prosecution

38
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,080
by anyone except
the highest court in Brazil.

39
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,800
He virtually has immunity.
That does not look good.

40
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,120
It says something about
what some protesters think of Lula

41
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,560
that they already had
a giant inflatable effigy on hand

42
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,640
the second the move was announced.

43
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,240
Although, I will say,
that balloon looks less like Lula,

44
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,040
and more like a Picasso drawing
of Mandy Patinkin.

45
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,080
But this was the beginning of a
bewilderingly dramatic few days.

46
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,160
First, a Brazilian judge
nullified the appointment.

47
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,000
Then a judge from a higher court
nullified that nullification.

48
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,800
And then things got crazy.

49
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,480
As soon as President Rousseff
got an injunction overturned

50
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,120
against Lula being appointed
to her cabinet,

51
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,880
at least 20 other judges
across the country

52
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,640
filed their own injunctions
to block him from taking the post.

53
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,440
The judiciary is now in open revolt
against the executive branch.

54
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,080
Huge pro-Rousseff and Lula rallies
took place on Friday.

55
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,320
And let's all please enjoy
this brief moment

56
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,320
of feeling superior
to the political chaos of Brazil,

57
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,560
because it's exactly how the rest
of the world will feel this summer,

58
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,680
watching the Republican Party
tear itself apart,

59
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,040
denying the person who got
the most votes their nomination.

60
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,360
So for now,
let's move on to the Supreme Court.

61
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,320
America's fifth-most-watched
legal drama.

62
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,280
On Wednesday, the president unveiled
his pick for their newest member.

63
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,360
I am nominating
Chief Judge Merrick Brian Garland

64
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,040
to join the Supreme Court.

65
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,880
By all accounts, Judge Garland
is deeply experienced.

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,080
He is seen by some
as really the best pick

67
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,960
that a republican senate could ask
for from a democratic president.

68
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,680
Garland is an experienced,
moderate judge,

69
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,760
respected by everyone
on both sides of the aisle,

70
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,520
which is more than you can say
for most people at their own wedding.

71
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,880
Not just his moderate views might
make him appealing to republicans.

72
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,920
There's another, slightly creepier
factor to take into consideration.

73
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,880
Merrick Garland is 63 years old,
one of the oldest nominees ever.

74
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,640
It's an easier pill
for Republicans to swallow,

75
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,560
having someone older
rather than someone younger.

76
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,400
He is a consensus candidate.
He's 63 years old.

77
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,920
He's unlikely to serve very long.

78
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,480
Holy shit !
It has got to be a bit weird

79
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,840
hearing one of your most attractive
qualities is your diminished lifespan.

80
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,960
The message to republicans is...
Think about Merrick Garland

81
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,240
the way you think about the 14-old cat
your girlfriend had when you moved in:

82
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,880
you may not like him, but at least
he'll be dead relatively soon.

83
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,320
But senate republicans
have vowed not to confirm

84
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,160
anyone Obama nominates
to the Supreme Court.

85
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,640
And they insisted
their position has not changed.

86
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,000
The decision the senate
announced weeks ago

87
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,960
remains about a principle
and not a person.

88
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,920
I'm not going to change
my position.

89
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,800
I don't care if they put
my brother on there.

90
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,560
It doesn't matter if Obama
would nominate George W. Bush.

91
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,920
I would still not do it.

92
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:01,240
Wait ! You created a hypothetical using
the best candidate you could think of,

93
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,960
and you came up
with George W. Bush ?

94
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,160
"I wouldn't go into that restaurant
if Guy Fieri himself was the chef !"

95
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,000
What point
are you trying to make there ?

96
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,320
The republicans
are in a tough spot here.

97
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,360
They know their position
is logically indefensible,

98
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,440
and some,
like Senator Orrin Hatch,

99
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,040
have really painted themselves
into a corner.

100
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,000
In 2010 he called Garland
"a consensus nominee",

101
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,480
but is now refusing
to even meet with him.

102
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,160
And there is something
profoundly emblematic

103
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,440
of the republicans' cynicism
in his explanation for why.

104
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,960
Right now the political arena
is toxic, difficult,

105
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,640
and terrible to bring
this nominee up at this time.

106
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,640
Hold on, the atmosphere
is too toxic to bring him up ?

107
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,520
You are the one making it toxic !
I live by a hard and fast rule:

108
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,880
you do not get out
of having to do the dishes

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,280
just because you took a shit
in the sink.

110
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,400
And now this !

111
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,480
And now, more of CBS This Morning's
awkward sex talk.

112
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,560
- It's always good to come back home.
- Looks like you've got a tan.

113
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,320
You noticed ?

114
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,560
- Welcome back to CBS This Morning.
- One more time.

115
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,640
Charlie likes black people !

116
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,600
Charlie it's not good to date
coworkers, so leave me alone.

117
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,920
- We had a good time ?
- A really good time.

118
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,000
More on that later.

119
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,320
A gentleman never tells.

120
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,680
Don't you find it attractive
when women make the first move ?

121
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,120
No reason to think a man's not gonna
like you because you come over.

122
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,120
Charlie looks handsome in blue.

123
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

124
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,680
Do you two want to be alone ?

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,320
You have a little tickle
in your throat...

126
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,720
- A little cold.
- Where'd you get that from ?

127
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,400
From her last week.

128
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,320
We'll take a break
from kissing when I've got a cold.

129
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,600
- You like sweet things.
- Not cupcakes.

130
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,200
Alright !

131
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,320
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns walls.

132
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,080
The envy of all employees
who work in open plan offices.

133
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,520
"I would take
a fucking beaded curtain"

134
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,080
"just so I don't have to directly
observe Carol clip her nails."

135
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,520
"Do it at home, Carol !"

136
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,960
This year, one particular wall
has gotten a lot of our attention.

137
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,480
I will build a great, great wall
on our southern border.

138
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,840
That's a Trump wall.

139
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,480
I will build the greatest wall
that you've ever seen.

140
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,560
I want a gorgeous wall. The Trump wall,
would that be a beautiful wall ?

141
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,960
Donald Trump wants to build a wall
on the U.S.-Mexican border.

142
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,120
And, based on his tone,
he also wants to fuck that wall.

143
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,320
The wall is such a fixture
of his speeches,

144
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,480
and so popular
among his supporters,

145
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,520
one man even wore a spandex
wall costume at one of his rallies.

146
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,360
That's kind of incredible.

147
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,840
The only group of people more excited
about barriers are high school teachers.

148
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,120
"That's right,
when you're horny,"

149
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,960
"there is nothing better
than a good dental dam !"

150
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,680
"It feels exactly the same !"

151
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,960
It doesn't. It really doesn't.

152
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,800
The border wall
is one of the few policy proposals

153
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,960
Trump has talked about in detail.

154
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,280
Instead of mocking or dismissing it,

155
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,800
let's take a proposal by a serious
presidential candidate seriously.

156
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,640
Let's put aside the potential racism
and xenophobia involved here.

157
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,440
We can come back to that later.

158
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,800
Instead, let's focus on the practicality
of whether and how it can be done.

159
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,520
Let's start with the cost.
When Trump started talking about this,

160
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,480
he said it would cost a lot,
but not a lot a lot.

161
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,080
Let's say the wall costs 4 billion.
They say $10 billion.

162
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,800
4 billion
if you know what you're doing.

163
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,200
He's saying he could build a wall

164
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,880
at 40 percent
of what it would cost others.

165
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,320
Which I would say
is an insane magic trick,

166
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,280
if I thought his tiny fingers could
wrap all the way around a magic wand.

167
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,600
That's an actual photo.

168
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,840
But since then,
his estimate has grown.

169
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,000
The wall is gonna cost 6-7 billion.
The wall is 8 billion dollars.

170
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,720
It's going to cost $10 billion
to build the wall.

171
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,440
A lot of money. It's a wall.

172
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,840
The wall's going to cost 10 billion
dollars. Maybe 12, depending.

173
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,320
We've gone
from 4-12 billion dollars.

174
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,720
Donald Trump's margin of error
is the entire GDP of Moldova.

175
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,800
We're now at $12 billion dollars.
But to truly know the real cost,

176
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,360
we're going to need to know what
the wall is going to be made from.

177
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,520
If Donald Trump could
explain it to me like I'm a child.

178
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,280
So, you're going to build the wall ?
What's it going to be made out of ?

179
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,160
That's a good question.
Lift him up here, bring him up.

180
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,000
What are the walls
going to be made out of ?

181
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,400
It's gonna be made of concrete
and of rebar and steel.

182
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,440
Trump is holding
that child less like a human being

183
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,160
and more like a cat
he just gave a bath to.

184
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,080
But second to be fair,
rebar and steel.

185
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,520
That is a clear answer.
I appreciate that.

186
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,400
The amount we would need would
depend on the height of the wall.

187
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,600
Trump has been unclear on that,

188
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,760
suggesting numbers ranging
from 35 to 90 feet.

189
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,920
So let's work with his lowest
estimate: a 35 foot tall wall,

190
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,320
which Trump has said we would
need around a thousand miles of.

191
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,800
According
to one construction economist,

192
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,760
that would cost $10 billion
for the concrete panels,

193
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,280
and $5 to $6 billion for steel
columns, including labor,

194
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,680
plus another billion for concrete
footing for the columns,

195
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,080
and a concrete foundation,
so, that's at least $16 billion.

196
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,120
We're already four billion
over his largest budget

197
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,520
and we've only
just gotten started here.

198
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,360
You're going to have to transport
those material,

199
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,280
into areas inaccessible
to construction vehicles.

200
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,800
So that same expert estimates
another $2 billion to build a road

201
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,400
so 20-ton trucks
can deliver those materials.

202
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,960
It's not even getting
into another 30 percent

203
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,240
for engineering,
design, management.

204
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,880
So now we're up
to around $25 billion,

205
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,720
anywhere from two to six times
Trump's estimates.

206
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,680
But we're still not done:
all of that is just building the wall.

207
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,960
The congressional budget office
estimated that wall maintenance costs

208
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,680
would exceed the initial construction
costs within seven years.

209
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,120
So it's a big, dumb thing that only
gets more expensive over time.

210
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,360
It's like getting a pet walrus.
You think it's stupid now:

211
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,360
wait until you learn what a bucket
of sea cucumbers costs.

212
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,160
You've not prepared for that.
But whatever the cost is,

213
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,360
Trump claims
he has got a way to pay for it.

214
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,880
Mexico is going to pay for the wall.
They're going to pay for the wall.

215
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,360
Mexico is gonna pay for the wall.
And they're gonna be happy about it.

216
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,240
Of course they are.

217
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,680
People love it when you make them
pay for shit they don't want.

218
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,840
That's why everyone's so happy
when their cable company

219
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,720
bundles together cable,
internet, and landline.

220
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,920
Landline. Thank you !

221
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,440
Landline, lucky me !

222
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,040
It'll come in handy when I need to call
my cell phone because I can't find it.

223
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,240
But is Mexico
going to pay for the wall ?

224
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,320
The Mexican treasury secretary's
said Mexico, under no circumstance,

225
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,360
is going to pay for the wall
that Mr. Trump is proposing.

226
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,560
And two former Mexican presidents
were even clearer...

227
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,080
Mexican people, we are not
gonna pay any single cent

228
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,840
for such a stupid wall.

229
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,600
I declare I'm not gonna pay
for that fucking wall.

230
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,640
He should pay for it !

231
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,160
I think the best part of that clip

232
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,080
is the fact that he even took
the extra effort to swear in English.

233
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,040
"This may be my second language"

234
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,560
"but I want to make sure
you fuckers understand it."

235
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,440
When Trump was asked, he responded
with characteristic diplomacy.

236
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,000
The wall just got 10 feet taller,
believe me. Ten feet taller.

237
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,600
C'mon ! Things don't get
bigger just because you're angry.

238
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,360
If that were true, Alec Baldwin would
be a hundred feet tall by now !

239
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,320
Now to be fair,

240
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,000
Trump has thought through how
he will get Mexico to foot the bill:

241
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,080
We have a $58 billion
trade deficit with Mexico.

242
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,280
That's why they're going to pay.

243
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,080
Okay, I see. Mexico will pay,
because we have a trades deficit.

244
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,800
Unfortunately, that's
literally not how anything works.

245
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,400
We did buy 58 billion dollars more
in goods and services

246
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,880
from Mexico than they did
from us last year,

247
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,960
that money doesn't belong
to the Mexican government.

248
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,240
It's earned by Mexican businesses.
It's not lying around

249
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,360
in some centralized Scrooge McDuck
money bin labeled

250
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,480
"Dumb Americans' money:
do not spend on border fence."

251
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:36,200
Let's put all this aside and
let's say we did find the money.

252
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
Where would we put
a border wall ?

253
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,960
Now your instinct says:
"on the border".

254
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,600
Even that is actually
more difficult than it sounds.

255
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,120
We know because in 2006, George
W. Bush signed the "Secure Fence Act",

256
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,080
the construction of 700 miles
of fencing along the border.

257
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,960
A project, which then-senators Barack
Obama and Hillary Clinton voted for.

258
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,640
Which is terrible.
Although keep in mind,

259
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,680
that millions of you
voted for Taylor Hicks in 2006,

260
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,600
so maybe don't be quite
so quick to judge.

261
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,960
Soul patrol !

262
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:14,120
That fence ran into
a lot of problems, though.

263
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,080
In large stretches of Texas,
the border consists of the Rio Grande.

264
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,920
Typically, you can't build
a wall along the river,

265
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,040
as a 1970 treaty prohibits building

266
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,880
anything that "may cause obstruction
of normal flow of the river."

267
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,840
Some stretches of the border fence
were built considerably inland.

268
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,160
And as towns like Brownsville, Texas,
have learned, that can be a problem.

269
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,840
This here is the Rio Grande river,
cuts all the way.

270
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,520
You can see it makes
a natural crescent there.

271
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,080
This is Mexico, all back here.
Here's where the wall's built,

272
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,920
so all of this golf course

273
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:57,640
is stuck
between Mexico and this border fence.

274
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,680
That course was stuck between
the US border fence and Mexico,

275
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,120
in a space that, like the Queso Diablo
burrito at Qdoba,

276
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,200
isn't really American
but sure as shit isn't Mexican.

277
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,720
The ridiculousness of this situation
was not lost on the players.

278
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,040
Do you realize you're not really
in the United States or Mexico here ?

279
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,200
I don't care,
as long as I'm on the golf course.

280
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,800
Do you think it's helping
with security ?

281
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,880
No. Stupid.

282
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,200
That woman said in two words

283
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,200
what I'm taking twenty minutes
to say in this piece.

284
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,640
"Does the fence help ?"
"No. Stupid."

285
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,080
Texas became a real problem
for constructing that fence.

286
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,120
Because in Texas there is no federally
owned buffer along the Mexican border,

287
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,480
meaning the land is mostly owned
by citizens, like the Loop family,

288
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,320
who discovered
that three quarters of their land

289
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,080
would suddenly be
on the other side of the fence.

290
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,080
When Homeland Security asked
the Loops to sign away

291
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,560
rights to their land for the fence,
they said no way.

292
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,880
I said I'm not signing
anything at this point.

293
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,520
This is not possible.

294
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,080
Government used the power of eminent
domain and condemned their property.

295
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,920
And the Loops weren't alone,
hundreds of property owners

296
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,560
were sued by the federal government
so the fence could be built.

297
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,280
Perhaps the only silver lining
here might be that historically,

298
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,680
when the government
treats you terribly,

299
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,080
you at least get an offensive
football team named after you.

300
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,640
I guess one day we can all look
forward to the Washington Loops.

301
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,560
It's a sign of respect !

302
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,400
They're respecting their heritage,
why can't you understand that ?

303
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,880
The fence's damage
didn't stop there.

304
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,840
Michael Chertoff,
secretary of Homeland Security,

305
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,560
gave his department the authority
to waive 36 laws to build the fence,

306
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,480
including the Endangered Species Act,
the Safe Drinking Water Act,

307
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,360
and the Native American Graves
Protection and Repatriation act.

308
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,360
He even welded parts of the fence,
wearing an American eagle facemask.

309
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,840
And he looks like a member
of Daft Punk

310
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,960
if Daft Punk played
nothing but Lee Greenwood covers.

311
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,040
That Native American grave clause
came in horrifyingly handy,

312
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,440
as this Native American leader
explains:

313
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,440
Fragments of human remains were
found in heavy equipment tracks

314
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,560
on the Christian Ranch
Archaeological site,

315
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,200
a site now crossed by barriers
and the border road.

316
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,840
Imagine a bulldozer
in your family graveyard.

317
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,920
I think "imagine a bulldozer in your
family graveyard"

318
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,360
is definitely the worst verse
of John Lennon's "Imagine".

319
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,560
It is not my favorite.

320
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,080
The fence has posed dangers
to the survival in the U.S.

321
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,240
of everything from jaguars
to pronghorns, to pygmy owls.

322
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,120
Look how shocked
they look by that fact !

323
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,840
Although they do permanently look
like you've murdered their families.

324
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:18,400
Trump might well argue having
a wall is worth all this,

325
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,440
because it will stop people and
drugs flowing across the border.

326
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,640
But let's look at that. The most
recent authoritative estimate suggests

327
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,720
nearly half of the unauthorized
migrants in the U.S. entered legally,

328
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,240
through an airport
or a border crossing,

329
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,600
with visas
that they then overstayed.

330
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,160
It's like wearing a condom
to protect against head lice.

331
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,720
You could do that,
but that's not really how

332
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,960
you keep the thing you're
worried about from happening.

333
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,760
There are not some people crossing
the border where a wall would be.

334
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,400
But would a wall really stop them ?

335
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,920
What the border patrol says is that
if you build a 30 foot wall,

336
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,320
all it's going to do is create
a market for 31-foot ladders.

337
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,320
Of course.
And, by the way, remember,

338
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,640
when you're looking for
a 31-foot ladder, avoid Werner.

339
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,960
It's like dousing yourself in grease
and climbing a pile of tetanus.

340
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,600
Do yourself a favor
and get a Dewalt ladder.

341
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,400
I'm not being paid to say that.
I'm just a fan.

342
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,440
A fan, and a very happy customer.

343
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,720
Ladders are not the wall's only
weakness. Watch as Donald Trump

344
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,160
inadvertently stumbles
his way into a key realization:

345
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:41,480
You take precast plank.
It comes 30, 40, 50 feet long.

346
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,120
There's no ladder going over that.
If they ever get up there,

347
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,520
they're in trouble, 'cause there's
no way to get down, maybe a rope.

348
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,280
Yeah. Maybe a rope.
Yes.

349
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,920
Your brilliant plan has been
undone by mankind's third invention.

350
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,520
As for stopping drugs,

351
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,440
walls and fences have not posed
much of a challenge to cartels.

352
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,320
In Mexico, police discovered a tunnel
used to smuggle drugs into the U.S.

353
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,600
Using this make shift cannon they were
shooting marijuana across the border.

354
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,280
These men were using a catapult
to launch drugs across the border.

355
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:31,160
Other smugglers just get somebody
with a good arm who throws it over.

356
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,800
If they're looking for a new recruit,
Peyton Manning is between jobs.

357
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,520
For many people,
efficacy is beside the point.

358
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,000
This wall is about
making us feel safer.

359
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,360
And here is where the racism
and xenophobia that we put aside

360
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,160
needs to be brought back.

361
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,680
While politicians have
supported barriers at the border,

362
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,960
Trump has been clear about
who we need to be protected from.

363
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,560
When Mexico sends its people,
they're not sending their best.

364
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,040
They're bringing drugs. They're
bringing crime. They're rapists.

365
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,600
And some, I assume,
are good people.

366
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,400
Trump sounds like an angry villager
running through the town square

367
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,080
yelling "Werewolves !
Run for your lives !"

368
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,720
"Though some are good werewolves,
but they're here to kill you,"

369
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,920
"with maybe a few exceptions,
but mostly: werewolves !"

370
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,800
"Run ! Werewolves love me,
but they're here to kill all of us."

371
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,360
While individual undocumented
immigrants committed horrible crimes.

372
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,040
So, obviously,
have American citizens.

373
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,400
Researchers find that immigrants
are less, not more,

374
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,440
crime prone than
their native-born counterparts.

375
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,600
The crime rates among immigrants
once here are relatively tiny digits,

376
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,800
which is something Trump
should frankly understand,

377
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,720
given that he has ten of them
attached to his miniscule wrists.

378
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,760
None of this is to say
the idea of the wall

379
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,080
is not still comforting
for some people,

380
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,240
or, as one man who actually
lives near the border puts it:

381
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,560
This was put up to illustrate

382
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,920
to Joe whoever up in Dubuque
or some place,

383
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,680
they see a picture of this

384
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,920
and their over-stuffed butts
looking at a too big TV thinking,

385
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,480
yeah, that'll stop 'em.

386
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,200
Of course it doesn't.

387
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,480
This guy is amazing,

388
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,880
shitting on the fat cat out-of-touch
metropolis that is Dubuque, Iowa.

389
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,880
Even if it does make the people
of Dubuque feel safer,

390
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,640
given everything we've seen,
is it worth it ?

391
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:52,000
We calculated that this could
conservatively cost $25 billion,

392
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,520
excluding the cost of both
maintenance and the land under it.

393
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,320
That works out to around
$77 per person.

394
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,680
And here is where I would like
to make a counterproposal.

395
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,280
If the main thing it's going to get us
is a warm sense of satisfaction,

396
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,920
I suggest, instead of
building that wall,

397
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,480
we use the money to buy every man,
woman and child in America

398
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,200
a Palmer waffle iron.

399
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:22,720
These beauties retail at $75 apiece,
we'd still have a billion dollars left.

400
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:27,120
This isn't one per household.
This is one per person.

401
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,840
You have five people in your family ?
Five waffle irons coming your way.

402
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,520
Not only is this cost-effective,
unless you are a really sick fuck,

403
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,200
this waffle iron plan would
not kill a single pygmy owl.

404
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,080
I know what you're thinking:
John, this is a stupid idea.

405
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:50,000
But is it ? Is it really ?
Yes, obviously, it is.

406
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,880
But is it significantly stupider
than Donald Trump's wall ?

407
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,600
This waffle iron plan
will cost less,

408
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,040
it'll do nearly as much to keep
out immigrants and drugs,

409
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,080
won't harm our relationship
with our trading partner,

410
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,600
if it is racist,
it's only toward Belgians,

411
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,560
and unlike Donald Trump's wall,
this makes fucking waffles.

412
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,920
So come on America,
let's ask ourselves:

413
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,160
what kind of country do
we want to wake up to ?

414
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,240
One that spends billions on an
impractical symbol of fear ?

415
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:31,720
Or one that smells like breakfast ?
Exactly. And now, this.

416
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,920
And now...

417
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:39,760
The sexual tension on CBS this morning
is going through the fucking roof.

418
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,920
What you've done to me ?

419
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:49,080
You make me feel so good inside !

420
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,360
- And I just want to be...
- So close to you !

421
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,560
You make me feel so alive...

422
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,360
- The news is back in the morning.
- I'm gonna die and go to heaven.

423
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,360
And finally tonight: a few more
words on the Supreme Court,

424
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,360
site of more flowy black robes than
Mariah Carey packing for a funeral.

425
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,480
The senate is stalling confirmation
hearings for Merrick Garland.

426
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,480
But we at Last Week Tonight do
not have the luxury of time on this.

427
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,520
If there is even a chance
Garland might be confirmed,

428
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,640
that is going to impact
our all dog Supreme Court.

429
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,360
These are the dogs we use to re-enact
Supreme Court oral arguments

430
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,200
because cameras
are not allowed in the courtroom.

431
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,600
This new dog will have some
big paw prints to fill.

432
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,400
'Cause while Antonin Scalia
was a divisive figure on the court,

433
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,080
bulldog Scalia was universally beloved
due to his cheerful demeanor

434
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,120
and his ability to avoid
humping Justice Kagan,

435
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,680
which frankly could not be said
for all the justices.

436
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,600
I'm talking to you, Samuel Alito.
Bad justice.

437
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,720
If Merrick Garland
is going to take Scalia's place,

438
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,000
we need a dog
who captures his essence.

439
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,880
Tonight, we're asking you
to advise and consent

440
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:16,360
as we pick from among
these three fantastic dog justices,

441
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,760
any one of whom could
effectively portray Merrick Garland.

442
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,920
Now from left, we have Mollie,
who if appointed would be

443
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,720
the first miniature schnauzer
on the highest dog court in the land.

444
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,600
In the middle, there is Biscuit,
a pug with nuanced opinions

445
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,440
on drug sentencing laws and
time-out for sitting on the couch.

446
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,920
And finally, there is Winston,

447
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,560
a terrier known for his blistering
dissents and glossy coat.

448
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,160
Winston still makes time for his wife
of nearly two years and their 37 kids.

449
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,960
These... Calm down, Winston.
These are your options, America.

450
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,880
They look entirely
different from one another,

451
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,600
and yet, somehow all look
exactly like Merrick Garland.

452
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,040
Please tweet your choice,
Mollie, Biscuit or Winston,

453
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,000
to #doggarland, and we will
take them into due consideration.

454
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,080
Even though the senate is refusing
to decide something important,

455
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,760
we can still decide on something
monumentally stupid.

456
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,800
That is our show.
Thank you so much for watching.

457
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,880
We'll be back in two weeks.
Goodnight ! Good boy.

458
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,320
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

459
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,680
END OF EPISODE 6,
SEASON III
