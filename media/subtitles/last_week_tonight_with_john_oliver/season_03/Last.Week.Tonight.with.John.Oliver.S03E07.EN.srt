LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,760
SEASON III
EPISODE 7

3
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,840
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,160
Thank you so much for joining us.
Time for a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,560
And we begin with nuclear weapons.

6
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,600
The most terrifying thing you can
stockpile, right after baby dolls.

7
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,640
This week saw the biennial nuclear
security summit in Washington.

8
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,680
All the major world leaders
were there. Almost all of them.

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,240
One leader who could make
a huge difference

10
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,840
in securing nuclear material
was a no-show.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,240
Vladimir Putin has once again
snubbed President Obama.

12
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,080
And that is not ideal,
because a nuclear summit

13
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,880
is pretty much the only gathering
where you can legitimately say,

14
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,680
"Man, this would be so much better
if Vladimir Putin were here."

15
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,920
Russia had announced

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,480
Putin would be skipping the summit
a year and a half ago.

17
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,760
Normally, you only decline
something that far in advance

18
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,160
if it's a wedding save the date
from your ex-fiancé.

19
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,240
"Nice try, Beth. As it happens,
I am busy seventeen months from now."

20
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,760
"Why? Fuck you, that's why.
You hurt me, Beth."

21
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,360
But even without Putin,

22
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,640
there were plenty of issues regarding
nuclear weapons to talk about.

23
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,920
Just two days before they gathered,
America's potential next president

24
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,000
mentioned that he would be perfectly
comfortable with other countries

25
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,520
becoming nuclear powers,
including Japan and South Korea.

26
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,960
At some point we have to say,
you know what, we're better off

27
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,760
if Japan protects itself
against this maniac in North Korea,

28
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,680
we're better off if South Korea
is going to start to protect itself.

29
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,360
- Saudi Arabia, nuclear weapons ?
- Absolutely.

30
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,840
Absolutely. He says that
with the confidence of a man

31
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,880
who could easily find Saudi Arabia
on the map if, if he was given 3 tries

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,480
and the map only included
countries ending with Arabia.

33
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,240
And that's not all !

34
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,360
Trump also refused to rule out
using nuclear weapons in Europe,

35
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,680
for reasons including,
and I quote, "Europe is a big place".

36
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,080
And "it's a big place" is not a good
excuse for using nuclear weapons.

37
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,440
It's barely a good excuse
for peeing in the ocean.

38
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,280
It was clearly extremely important

39
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,560
that the president try and reassure
the rest of the planet

40
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,360
by providing some context
for Trump's remarks.

41
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,440
The person who made the statements
doesn't know much about foreign policy

42
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,360
or nuclear policy, or the Korean
peninsula or the world generally.

43
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,920
President Obama
is basically implying there

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,080
that you could fill a book with
the things Donald Trump doesn't know,

45
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,480
that book being the encyclopedia.

46
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,120
But, let's turn now to happier news:
the baseball season started today.

47
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,600
Exactly. It's a romantic time,
because anything is still possible:

48
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,240
the Cubs could win it all, Ichiro could
join the elite three-thousand hit club,

49
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,040
the Philly Phanatic could get waxed
and finally reveal the tight,

50
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,280
slammin' bod he's been hiding
under all that green fur.

51
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,520
He looks good.

52
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,480
There is only one thing that
we can all be sure of this season,

53
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,120
and that is that the New York Yankees
will continue finding ways

54
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,400
to look like the biggest
elitist assholes in all of sport.

55
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,960
This is a team that does things
like blow $275 million on A-Rod,

56
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,000
a man who poses for photos
like this one:

57
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,080
ahoy there, ahoy there, asshole!

58
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,320
It's like that scene from Titanic,
except you're rooting for the sea.

59
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,840
The Yankees even have what they call
a "Legends Club" for elite members,

60
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,760
and their sales pitch for it is as
obnoxious as you'd, as you'd expect.

61
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:26,160
Legends is an amazing private club.
It's the first 5 rows of our stadium.

62
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,000
First-class accommodations,
five star dining, in-seat service,

63
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,360
an amazing concierge team that assists
with any needs that you do have.

64
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,640
We do have our private suite entrance,
which is for our legends clients.

65
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,560
They access the lobby
before any of our guests.

66
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,200
"We provide priority lobby access !
And for our diamond elite members,"

67
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,560
"we'll drive you to a restaurant
nowhere near the stadium,"

68
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,680
"so you don't have to fraternize
with these baseball-loving peasants."

69
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,320
This is where the Yankees have found
a way to antagonize their own fans.

70
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,280
Because this year, they got rid
of the option to print tickets at home.

71
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,560
And when fans complained
the Yankees' COO, Lonn Trost,

72
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:15,000
seen here posing in the way you'd
expect a Yankees executive to pose,

73
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,800
he went on the radio and denied
those effects, but in doing so,

74
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,920
threw in a comment
that made it clear

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,200
what he thinks of some
of the Yankees' less affluent fans.

76
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,560
If you buy a ticket
in a very premium location,

77
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,200
it's not that we don't want
that fan to sell it,

78
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,760
but that fan is sitting there having
paid a substantial amount of money

79
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,760
and a fan picks it up for a buck
and a half and sits there

80
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,720
and it frustrates
the purchaser of the full amount.

81
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,400
And quite frankly,
the same, the fan

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,080
may be someone who has never sat
in a premium location.

83
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,960
So that's a frustration
to our existing fan base.

84
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,200
So rich people couldn't bear to sit
next to people who aren't as rich,

85
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,600
which would be offensive
if you were talking about the opera,

86
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,320
much less a sport whose primary
fashion statement is the goatee.

87
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,360
And that is why the Yankees
make sure no one

88
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,960
gets into their most premium seating
who doesn't belong there.

89
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,800
That explains why so many of
their fanciest seats are often empty.

90
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,080
For the first 3 games of this season,
there will be riffraff in those seats.

91
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:29,280
Because we bought two legends seats
to the first three games this week.

92
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,160
And they are right in this area,
behind home plate.

93
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,800
And we will sell them to you
for 25 cents apiece, on one condition:

94
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,960
you must dress like you have never
sat in a premium location before.

95
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,560
What that means could be up to you.

96
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,400
Tweet us a photo of what you
and a guest would wear to the game,

97
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,800
with the hashtag "I have never sat
in a premium location".

98
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,120
Include a hashtag
for the game you'd want to attend,

99
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,560
so that's Monday,
Wednesday, or Thursday.

100
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,120
And we will pick the winners,
based on the looks we like the best.

101
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,120
We are legally bound
to give you these contest rules,

102
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,600
as well as mention that the Yankees
are not involved in this contest,

103
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,840
although that should be pretty
fucking obvious by now.

104
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,960
Enjoy the game
and please give A-Rod our best !

105
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,520
And now this...

106
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,440
And now, did you know CNBC's
Joe Kernan has a personal trainer ?

107
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,880
I'm cross training,
and I've trained with Frayne.

108
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,600
He's the Marquis de Sade
of personal trainers.

109
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,520
- You have broad shoulders.
- They're getting broader with Eddie.

110
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,120
I have a trainer,
the Marquis de Sade of trainers.

111
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,480
You don't train with Eddie Frayne.

112
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,000
He might be too tough for you.
I'll show you what I do.

113
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,960
Here with some tips
is my trainer Eddie Frayne.

114
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,480
People do not do enough
for the lower back.

115
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,360
I wanna be Jack Wallay.

116
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,680
I wanna be doing
one-armed push ups.

117
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,080
Just like that, working his triceps.
For the straight leg lifts...

118
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,440
When you train with Frayne, it's hard.
I'm going to see if it's possible.

119
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,480
Straight legs, keep it straight !

120
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,480
You did 30 and I did 40,
and you were saying let's go to break.

121
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,520
- You're involved in this next one.
- No, I'm not.

122
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,280
- You can use the girly knee push-ups.
- No.

123
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,000
Let's get a check on the markets.

124
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,720
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns political fundraising.

125
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,640
This is not gonna be about how money
corrupts presidential candidates.

126
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,840
You can read much more on your most
annoying friend's Facebook posts.

127
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,640
It's a comment on a picture of a baby.
What is wrong with you? Take it down.

128
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,480
I would like to talk instead
about congressional fundraising,

129
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,520
which is much less covered,
but no less astonishing.

130
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,080
In the 2014 election cycle,
candidates for the house and senate

131
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:05,280
raised a combined $1.7 billion,
that's more than it costs

132
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,280
to buy 230 million tubes
of hemorrhoidal cooling gel.

133
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,440
And it's somehow
even more upsetting.

134
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,280
Interestingly, much of that money
has to be raised, one way or another,

135
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,480
by the politicians themselves, which
they have complained about for years,

136
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,440
and, and say that it can be
the worst part of their job.

137
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:30,680
I hated raising money.
Hated it.

138
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,240
It's painful frankly,
to continually ask people for money.

139
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,960
If Don and I can tell you
how many hours we spend,

140
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,720
with our good colleagues
on our side of the issues,

141
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,240
talking about raising money,
it would be an embarrassment.

142
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,920
It is an embarrassment.

143
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,200
An embarrassment !
That is a strong statement.

144
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,480
Although, he may be overestimating
Congress' capacity for embarrassment.

145
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,200
'Cause we are talking about a place
where these moments happened !

146
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,840
Do you like green eggs and ham ?

147
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,680
I do not like them, Sam I am.

148
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,280
Two bits, four bits,
six bits, a dollar.

149
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,800
All for the gators, stand up
and holler. Go gators.

150
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,640
Meet the Mets, meet the Mets,
step right up and greet the Mets.

151
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,800
Don't know much about chemistry,
don't know much toxicology,

152
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:35,560
don't know what's ammonium nitrate,
except it's easy to detonate,

153
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:42,400
but I do know that IST
was used to increase our security,

154
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,040
what a much safer world
this could be.

155
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,400
Don't know much
about the gas chlorine...

156
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:55,520
God ! What is most shocking
is that he read the room and decided,

157
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,800
"You know what ? I think
they want to hear another verse".

158
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,280
"I'm going to do another verse here.
I'm reading this room, I'm doing it."

159
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,800
But the sheer amount of time
politicians spend fundraising

160
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,280
is not just embarrassing,
it's horrifying.

161
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,160
Some say the members can spend
25 to 50 percent of their time on it.

162
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,680
Former senate majority leader
Tom Daschle once guessed that,

163
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,800
in the two years before an election,

164
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,080
senators can spend two thirds
of their time raising money.

165
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,720
And if two thirds of the work
you do is strictly about the money,

166
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,520
you're not a legislator,
you're Robert De Niro at that point.

167
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,320
Tonight, let's look
at where that time actually goes.

168
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,680
And let's begin with the most obvious
form of fundraising: fundraisers.

169
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,600
These are usually shitty parties
in DC bars, restaurants or townhouses.

170
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,280
The Sunlight Foundation estimates
that in the last election cycle,

171
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,600
members of Congress
held over 2 800 fundraisers.

172
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,320
Washington
is like Rod Stewart's haircut.

173
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,440
Party in the front,
party in the back.

174
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,960
Frankly, too much party
and no business anywhere to be found.

175
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,440
Fundraisers are so ubiquitous in DC,

176
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,880
you could conceivably construct
a whole day around them,

177
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,160
which is what former
Iowa representative Bruce Braley did

178
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,360
on September 20th, 2012,
when at 8:30 a.m.,

179
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,240
he held a fundraising breakfast,
followed by a fundraising lunch,

180
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,120
and ending
with a fundraising evening reception.

181
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,120
He was less a member of Congress

182
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,280
than he was a sentient storage
container for canapés.

183
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,800
Fundraisers are such an integral part
of DC's economy,

184
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,480
some restaurants derive a decent chunk
of their income from hosting them.

185
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,960
Look at Johnny's Half Shell,
a restaurant blocks from the Capitol.

186
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:50,440
In the past 10 years, a whopping
948 congressional fundraisers

187
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,960
have been held there.

188
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,520
It is almost inevitable
that your elected representative

189
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,680
will have spent at least some time
in a place that markets itself thusly.

190
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,840
Here's to the champagne
and the oysters at Johnny's.

191
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,760
- Here's to Johnny's crab cakes.
- Here's to the sliders at happy hour.

192
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,080
Here's to the hard shell crabs
at Johnny's half shell !

193
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,480
Here's to Johnny's !

194
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,920
Here's to you,
and your time at Johnny's Half Shell.

195
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,480
He is a significant figure in DC !

196
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,920
Influential decisions are being made
under the watchful eye

197
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,600
of a man who looks like Jon Bon Jovi's
less talented step-cousin

198
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,120
Jim Ban Jarvi.

199
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,000
Some politicians even turn
their own personal milestones

200
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,000
into fundraising opportunities.

201
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,840
Like republican Andy Barr,
who held a 41st birthday fundraiser,

202
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,960
which cost a minimum
of $500 per person to attend.

203
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,360
Or there's Florida representative
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,

204
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,760
who turned her 30th wedding
anniversary into a fundraiser,

205
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,960
an event that is almost
breathtaking in its sadness.

206
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,680
A 30th wedding anniversary should not
be about raising political capital.

207
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,520
It should be about eating
a largely silent dinner,

208
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,640
killing two bottles of wine,
forgetting to have sex...

209
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,160
And falling asleep to a Friends rerun.
Honor the anniversary and do it right.

210
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,040
And in perhaps the most pathetic bid
for hipness available,

211
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,240
many members of congress will even
stage fundraisers at pop concerts.

212
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,400
Taylor Swift not only changes
the music business, it makes money,

213
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,040
and so much
so that some of Washington's elites

214
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,000
are capitalizing
on the pop princesses' 1989 Tour

215
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,040
which stops over in DC tonight.

216
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,440
We have over ten republicans,
five democrats, three PACs,

217
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,360
all raising money
off this Taylor Swift concert.

218
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,000
Representative Beyer of Virginia
is having a fundraiser.

219
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,480
His daughter turned him
on to Taylor Swift.

220
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,120
He likes her feminist lyrics.
It's why they're moving forward.

221
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:57,200
Representative Don Beyer held a
fundraiser at a Taylor Swift concert.

222
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,400
I don't know about you,
but this man is not feeling 22.

223
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,200
He is feeling, and looking,
very much 65.

224
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,920
All of this is glamorous
compared to the hours

225
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,040
that politicians spend fundraising
over the phone.

226
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,400
A presentation from the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee

227
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,560
to freshmen lawmakers leaked and it
was showing their model schedule,

228
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,920
which suggested four hours
a day of call time, on the phone !

229
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,600
That makes sense if you're trying
to have phone sex with Sting.

230
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,520
Have you come yet ? It's been
three hours. Have you come yet ?

231
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,160
I've got stuff to do, Gordon.
This can't be my day.

232
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,840
Lawmakers have even been pulled out
of hearings to go do that call time.

233
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,200
The first week I was down here
we were having a hearing on education

234
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,880
and my chief of staff said:
"You have to leave."

235
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,480
We went into the anti-room
and I said "Where do I have to go ?"

236
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,400
She goes:
"You have to go make phone calls."

237
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,120
I looked at her and I went:
"This is my first hearing."

238
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,160
"You're asking me to leave ?
How am I gonna learn anything ?"

239
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:19,120
She was a rookie legislator. She
needed to learn how to do her job.

240
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,680
Knicks don't pull Kristaps Porzingis
out of a game

241
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,720
so he can go make cold calls
to season ticket holders,

242
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,800
that would not be the best use
of Kristaps Porzingis's time.

243
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:36,400
If that sounds like a dehumanizing
process, rest assured: it is.

244
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,160
I felt used when I had to go raise
money. I was embarrassed.

245
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,280
I thought it was ugly,
demeaning.

246
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,520
My staff kept saying, you got to go
do it. I said, I don't like it.

247
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,440
You get a Rolodex
and you get to dial numbers

248
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,840
of jerks you've never heard of
to get money out of them.

249
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,760
He's right. If you want to get money
out of a bunch of jerks,

250
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,640
you shouldn't have to call them when
you can simply open a vape shop.

251
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,160
Done.

252
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,080
And if you're wondering why he said
he had to go outside the building,

253
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,760
according to federal law,
members of congress

254
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,880
can't solicit or receive
donations in their offices.

255
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,800
Each party's committee has set up
call rooms in their headquarters,

256
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,920
just a few blocks from the Capitol.

257
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,920
We couldn't find footage from
those rooms, but they sound grim.

258
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,560
They've got cubicles and a headset
and they often have a minder

259
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,400
who makes sure that they don't
take too long on each call.

260
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,960
After a few hours it starts
to smell like a locker room.

261
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,920
Yeah. Half the people in that room
spent their morning

262
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,360
slurping down oysters in an 80s hockey
player's sweaty crab shack.

263
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,440
Just about all lawmakers
have to do this.

264
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,440
Even those like Eleanor Holmes Norton,
in ludicrously safe seats.

265
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,120
She regularly gets re-elected
with over 80 percent of the vote,

266
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,040
but despite that, she wound up
leaving this voicemail for a lobbyist:

267
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,760
I was surprised to see we don't have
a record, so far as I can tell,

268
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:28,720
of your having given to me despite
my long and deep work.

269
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,240
It's been my major work

270
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,400
on the committee and subcommittee
has been in your sector.

271
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,520
I'm candidly calling to ask
for a contribution.

272
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,400
That is so depressing to hear.
Even before you think about her

273
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,560
calling from a room filled with the
odor of Steny Hoyer's shrimp-burps.

274
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:58,440
Her seat is so safe, she barely needs
campaign funds for herself.

275
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,760
Members are still expected
to pay dues to their own party,

276
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,080
which can be distributed
to candidates in tougher races.

277
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,280
Buzzfeed got its hands on
a DCCC spreadsheet,

278
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,840
showing "The amount... The committee
expects each member to pay",

279
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,760
with figures ranging from
$125 000 at the low end,

280
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,360
all the way up
to $800 000 at the top.

281
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,440
So is it any wonder that politicians
are hitting up their customer base

282
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,080
harder than a Girl Scout
with gambling debts ?

283
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,560
Two boxes of Samoas ?
Fuck that.

284
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,920
Four boxes or I walk. Four boxes.
You get four boxes.

285
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:43,640
I know where you live.
Four for you.

286
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,200
If you're trying to rack up dollars,
that can affect the kind of people

287
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,040
you're targeting on the phone,
as senator Murphy explains:

288
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,280
I'm not calling anybody who doesn't
give me at least 1 000 dollars.

289
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,600
The people I'm calling
are folks that are making

290
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,760
a half a million to a million dollars

291
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,840
and they have different problems
than everybody else.

292
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,480
That is a huge problem.

293
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,520
It cannot help but affect
the way you see the world.

294
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,920
If you call donors rich
enough that their main concerns are

295
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,080
estate taxes, or which Belgian kimono
their cat will wear that day.

296
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,280
That's a good choice, though.
But to be fair,

297
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,680
direct fundraising by candidates
is just one part of a system

298
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,840
that includes Super PACs
and so-called "dark money".

299
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,520
To be even fairer,
it is still the largest part.

300
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,200
And regulating campaign finance
is going to be difficult.

301
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,040
There's the Supreme Court's
1976 Buckley vs. Valeo decision,

302
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,160
which held that spending money
is a form of speech.

303
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,640
There are times when that's true.

304
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,880
A fifty-year-old man spending money
on a convertible is loudly saying:

305
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,440
"I would like to sexually disappoint
a woman half my age."

306
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,520
We are hearing him loud
and clear, he's being heard.

307
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,440
While both sides
agree they hate this,

308
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,320
neither wants
to unilaterally back down first.

309
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,520
It's basically a cold war, but worse.
At least in the real Cold War,

310
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,160
we got a trip to the moon and
the 3rd best Rocky villain out of it.

311
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,120
Which is not to say that there are not
attempts to address the problem.

312
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,920
Democrats pushed the Disclose Act,
to force transparency on dark money,

313
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,200
and one republican
has something called the Stop Act,

314
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,400
which would prohibit members of
congress from asking for donations.

315
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,240
Those would be small fixes. A larger
idea is Government By The People Act,

316
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,560
which would give tax credits and
provide public funding

317
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,520
by matching small donations
at a ratio of at least 6 to 1.

318
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,920
Before you get too excited, two
slight caveats: first, we asked,

319
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,600
and it would cost an estimated
$500 million a year, which is a lot.

320
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,000
Govtrack.us offers predictions
on whether bills are likely to pass,

321
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:14,280
gives it a zero percent chance
in our current congress.

322
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,600
Makes you wonder if they tried to find
something more harsh than zero,

323
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,720
like "negative zero"
or "aw hell zero !"

324
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,520
Or just a zero
with a frowny face in it.

325
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,640
That's frustrating, because people in
congress are the ones complaining

326
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,120
about the time they are forced
to waste on fundraising.

327
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,000
Israel, a democrat from Long Island,
announced his retirement, saying:

328
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,560
"I can't spend another day making
another call begging for money."

329
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,520
Since he is leaving, I figured
he might be willing to shine a light

330
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,800
on some of the aspects
of fundraising we don't usually see.

331
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,280
I sat down with Steve Israel.
Take a look.

332
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,760
Thank you so much
for agreeing to talk with me.

333
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,880
Let's start with political
fundraising. In your prime,

334
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,920
how many of those fundraisers
were you having to go to a year ?

335
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,960
Over 16 years, I've done,
just for my own reelection,

336
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,840
1 600 fundraising events,
actual events.

337
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,080
One every three days,
more or less.

338
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,640
Over 16 years. That's a lot.

339
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,960
I'm going to say three words to you,
congressman: Johnny's Half Shell.

340
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,880
- I know it well.
- No shit you do.

341
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,000
What's it like in there ?

342
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,040
It's like any other restaurant
in America...

343
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,520
Which has lots of people
in suits raising money.

344
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,120
You have candidates and members
of Congress and supporters

345
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,960
who are contributing a thousand
dollars for having some shellfish.

346
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:57,280
It's interesting to me how every
working Congressperson in this city

347
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,600
has a basic understanding
of Johnny's Half Shell.

348
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,160
I don't think I've ever had
a fundraiser for myself.

349
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,320
At that restaurant.
I just don't remember.

350
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,960
In 2011,
you had a breakfast fundraiser

351
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,080
at the Half Shell
that started at 8:30 a.m.

352
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,400
No one goes to a seafood restaurant
at 8:30 in the morning

353
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,840
without expecting
something in return.

354
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,840
No one is saying:
"I was gonna be there anyway"

355
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,280
"to have my breakfast shrimp,
I'll swing by Steve's thing."

356
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,680
And that is the problem
with the system,

357
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,040
is that people believe that
if they are in that room,

358
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,080
having supported a campaign,
that they get access.

359
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,480
And in case access to Steve Israel
wasn't enticing enough,

360
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,960
a review of his fundraiser invites
threw up a common theme.

361
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:51,160
Some Congressmen have barbecue,
fishing trips. What was your theme ?

362
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,560
- I did a Long Island pizza night...
- But there was another theme ?

363
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,680
- Yes, what was it ?
- I think you know what it was.

364
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,840
I'm anxious to know.

365
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,920
You had an annual
Long Island wine trip,

366
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,800
Long Island wine tasting in DC,
Long Island wine and cigar tasting,

367
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,600
I hope those were not
Long Island cigars.

368
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,120
An event called
Chinese food and politics,

369
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,480
where you washed down your
General Tso's chicken with a glass...

370
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,720
No, you cannot bring Long Island
wine to Chinese food.

371
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,560
Does Long Island wine not pair well
with Chinese food ?

372
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,080
- Not Washington Chinese food.
- What with ? Street violence ?

373
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,840
You're not going to get me to say one
negative thing about Long Island wine.

374
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,960
I hadn't come here
to talk about terrible wine,

375
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,600
but the engine room
of congressional fundraising.

376
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,800
The congressional call center...
How important is that place ?

377
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,560
You've gotta have
a place to make those calls.

378
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,280
Paint me a word picture.
Is there motivational posters:

379
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,880
"Hang in there, try not to think
much about what you're doing !"

380
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,880
You have a bunch of cubicles set up
and those cheap fabric dividers,

381
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,120
you sit at a little desk, you have
a phone, an assistant next to you,

382
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:11,680
and you have a call book
with past donors and their records.

383
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:17,240
Your assistant gets a supporter on
the phone, gives the phone to you,

384
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,640
you engage in polite conversation
and then you get to the point,

385
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,280
you hang up, flip the page
to the next donor,

386
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,600
and you continue until you have the
resources in order to get re-elected.

387
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,520
- My god, that's depressing.
- Not what our founders had in mind.

388
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,400
How do you train people ?
Is there a script with small talk,

389
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,880
and how they could be part
of the solution ?

390
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Every member has their approach.

391
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,760
I got to the point and then
have a civilized conversation.

392
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,520
It makes sense, it's just like
someone giving you a massage

393
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,480
and starting with the hand job,
and then working the shoulders.

394
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,760
It's fine, it's just unexpected.

395
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,840
Everybody has their style
and preferences.

396
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,840
How much time between
hanging up and the next call ?

397
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,800
You gotta keep moving.
If you are in a competitive district,

398
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,400
and you've gotta
raise 1.5 million dollars,

399
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,960
you have to raise a certain
amount every quarter.

400
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,080
You break it down to
an amount every month.

401
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,000
You break it down to
an amount of money every week,

402
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,120
and to a certain amount
of money in every hour of call time.

403
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,960
This call center sounds like
a shitty telemarketing operation.

404
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,760
It is a form of torture,

405
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:40,440
and the real victims of this torture
have become the people,

406
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,320
they believe that they don't have
a voice in this system.

407
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,320
Most good telemarketing operations

408
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:54,000
have a boss who holds
people's feet to the fire.

409
00:27:54,120 --> 00:28:00,200
- Who was that boss for you ?
- The prospect of losing my election.

410
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,120
To a Republican who would undo
the work I did for the middle class.

411
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,320
I'm getting to the point that
you were the chairman.

412
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,120
Yes. Chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee.

413
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,200
So you were the one pushing
people to hit quotas ?

414
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,080
I had a responsibility to tell them,
you need to spend time raising money

415
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,560
to come to Washington
to change the system.

416
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,920
And he must've told them that a lot,
because in Israel's time as chairman,

417
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
he pushed members of the DCCC
to hit record fundraising levels.

418
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,360
We outraised the NRCC
by 16.2 million dollars.

419
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,720
It can't have been easy to hate
something he was so good at.

420
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,200
Like finding out this guy hates
having bees on his face.

421
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,040
He's not wrong,
it's absolutely repulsive.

422
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,800
It's weird he chose
to do it in the first place.

423
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,760
With his congressional career
coming to an end,

424
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,400
it was time to toast Steve Israel
in the most appropriate way.

425
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:04,200
I brought some Long island wine
in the traditional bag.

426
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,680
It's a very good vintage.
Is that a 2016 ?

427
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,000
Does it go back further than that ?

428
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,920
I wouldn't recommend drinking it
out of the bag.

429
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,840
I would never do this to a glass.

430
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,400
Not bad for wine in a bag.

431
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,080
Sure, that's fair.

432
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,320
What better end
to a bittersweet career

433
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,680
than with the bittersweet
taste of North Fork Chardonnay ?

434
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,320
Savor every last drop, Steve.
You've earned it.

435
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,960
That's our show, thanks for watching.
See you next week, goodnight !

436
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,880
LAST WEEK TONIGHT

437
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,400
END OF EPISODE 7,
SEASON III
