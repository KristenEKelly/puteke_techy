1
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,680
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to Last Week Tonight.

2
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,280
Thank you so much for joining us.

3
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,440
I'm John Oliver, just time
for a quick recap of the week.

4
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,680
And we begin with Egypt.
Or, as ISIS calls it, "next".

5
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,400
Egypt is currently in the throes of
a serious economic crisis,

6
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,120
and their leader, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi,
has not been handling it well.

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,720
Just a couple of weeks ago, he unveiled
a new public housing complex,

8
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,200
which should've been great news,

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,800
but he didn't strike a particularly
appropriate tone.

10
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,920
Abdel Fattah el-Sisi arrived on a red
carpet that stretched over two miles.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,720
Soon after the extravagant arrival

12
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,560
el-Sisi made a speech
about cutting government subsidies,

13
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,520
claiming the state could not continue
to subsidize water and electricity.

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,480
Strutting down a red carpet which
reportedly cost $200,000,

15
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,880
on the very day you plan to tell people
to use less water.

16
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,680
The only less sensitive way
he could've arrived was via log flume.

17
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:34,000
So this week, el-Sisi tried again
to boost Egypt's economic spirits,

18
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,640
by launching a new development strategy
called "vision 20-30."

19
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,080
Which, frankly, already wasn't ideal,

20
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,480
as that name is already synonymous with
vision being not quite perfect.

21
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,160
And wait until you hear
some of the details of the plan.

22
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,640
We are a nation of 90 million.
Just think about it.

23
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,280
If only 10 million of us wake up
every day

24
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,400
and they donate by SMS
one Egyptian pound,

25
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,120
just one for the sake of this homeland.
That's 10 million pound a day.

26
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,560
Yes, part of el-Sisi's solution was
"hey, why don't you text me money ?"

27
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,000
He's begging for public support the way
Paula Deen begged people

28
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,720
to keep her on
"Dancing With The Stars."

29
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,280
Although I will admit, his plan
nearly had one very intriguing option:

30
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,360
For myself, I can say seriously,

31
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,240
if I may be sold.

32
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,800
It's ok for me to be sold.

33
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Okay, then !
Selling yourself for the country.

34
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,640
You are pitching an amazing sequel to
"Indecent Proposal".

35
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,960
A man tries to save his country...
The hard way.

36
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,000
And credit here to the Egyptian people
who channeled their anger

37
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,760
into setting up an eBay page,

38
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,240
offering the sale of a used
field marshal in decent condition.

39
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,760
Which, honestly, wouldn't be the
dumbest thing ever to be sold on e-Bay.

40
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,680
After all, last month some idiot paid
$106 for

41
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,640
"possibly the largest Raisin Bran
flakes in the world."

42
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,920
And let me just say: that idiot is very
happy with his purchase.

43
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,560
But, thank you, thank you.

44
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,840
But with all the turmoil Egypt is in
at the moment,

45
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,480
what el-Sisi needed to do

46
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,400
was reassure the country
he had everything under control.

47
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,920
But, again, I am not sure
he struck the right tone.

48
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,520
And I'm telling all Egyptians

49
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,600
that don't listen to anyone except me.

50
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,760
I'm serious !

51
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,400
Don't listen to anyone except me.

52
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,320
"Don't listen to anyone but me,
I'm serious."

53
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,600
It's not good
when your country's leader

54
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,600
sounds like a frightened
substitute teacher.

55
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,320
And just like a substitute teacher,

56
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,680
you have a feeling that el-Sisi is
going to be replaced very, very soon.

57
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,240
But let's move on to Guantanamo Bay.

58
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,560
The Hotel California of prisons,
in that you can never leave,

59
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,000
and like that album, it is a permanent
stain on America's reputation.

60
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,080
The president unveiled what he claimed
was a major new plan this week.

61
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,720
Today the department is submitting to
congress our plan

62
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,600
for finally closing the facility
at Guantanamo once and for all.

63
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,480
I don't want to pass this problem on
to the next president, whoever it is.

64
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,040
That's a laudable goal.
Guantanamo is like a 37-year-old

65
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,360
who's still trying to be a
singer-songwriter:

66
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,480
it's time someone shut that down.

67
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,200
You can't just pass the problem on to
his next girlfriend, whoever she is.

68
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,680
But if the president's speech
sounded familiar at all to you,

69
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,720
it may be because he signed
an executive order

70
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,200
just two days after taking office
to close Guantanamo.

71
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,640
And look at him back then !
So young, so hopeful !

72
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,320
Like a boy-band in the 90s signing
their first record contract

73
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,920
while Lou Pearlman salivates nearby.

74
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,960
And year after year,
he has made the same promise:

75
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,080
I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo
Bay closed by early next year.

76
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,800
Make no mistake: we will close
Guantanamo prison.

77
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,360
I still want to close Guantanamo. As
president, I have tried to close Gitmo.

78
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,440
I will continue to push to close Gitmo.

79
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,800
It's time to close Gitmo.

80
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,760
That's why I will keep working
to shut down the prison at Guantanamo.

81
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,320
Holy shit.
Just look at him then and now.

82
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,600
The president and Guantanamo Bay
are aging together

83
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,000
like the couple from "Up,"

84
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,080
and it's starting to seem like Obama
might be the wife who dies first.

85
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,840
But I hope

86
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,440
the president does not think
the 7th year is going to be the charm,

87
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,680
because the republican leadership's
stance can best be summed up

88
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,200
by a video
senator Pat Roberts released:

89
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,360
This is what I think of the president's
plan to send terrorists to the US.

90
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,640
Okay, well, first: sick shot.

91
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,920
Although technically,

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,760
that could mean you think the
president's plan is nothing but net.

93
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,640
So maybe work on your messaging.

94
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,960
But the law is actually
on senator Roberts' side.

95
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,680
In 2010, congress banned

96
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,320
the use of federal money
to bring detainees into the country.

97
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,560
And just three months ago,
they tightened those restrictions.

98
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,520
So the president's speech this week was
pretty much a symbolic gesture.

99
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,920
Like saying "let me help you with
the dishes" at the end of a party.

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,400
If you hand me a sponge,

101
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,800
I swear to fucking god I'm never coming
back to your apartment.

102
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,040
And while the president's determination
to get this done is admirable,

103
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,000
you have to wish that he'd thought
this closure through more fully.

104
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,160
Because the lack of a concrete plan
was painfully obvious

105
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,280
from the very day he signed
that executive order.

106
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,920
Guantanamo will be closed
no later than one year from now.

107
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,800
We will be...

108
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,080
Is there a separate executive order,
Greg,

109
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,160
with respect to how
we're gonna dispose of the detainees ?

110
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,360
- Is that written ?
- We're setting up a process.

111
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,880
We will be setting up a process whereby
this is gonna be taking place.

112
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,960
Wait, wait: who the fuck is Greg ?
And why are you asking him now ?

113
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,280
I have to say, when it comes to
dashed presidential promises,

114
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,320
president Obama's "mission
accomplished" might just be...

115
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,920
"You got this, Greg, right ?
Greg's got it."

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,040
And now this.

117
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,440
And now...

118
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,200
Basketball enthusiast Pat Roberts
spends 12 minutes of senate time

119
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,960
fantasizing about playing one on one
with the president.

120
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,200
Everybody knows the president's
a very good basketball player.

121
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,560
I would emphasize the president
bounce the ball to him,

122
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,840
just to bounce pass, to say your ball,
Mr. President. Ball's in your court.

123
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,120
He would probably go to the left corner
and sink a 3 about that time.

124
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,760
I would probably be dribbling a lot.
Or trying to.

125
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,480
And then after I shot and missed it
and I'd say,

126
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,640
your ball again, Mr. President.
By that time,

127
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,320
the president has scored a couple of
layups and two more jump shots.

128
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,040
By that time, the president
probably stole the ball

129
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,120
and scored another layup. I'm still
on my second shot, on the free shot.

130
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,840
I scored a hook shot, Mr. President.
That's the end of the ball game.

131
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,600
But it is not the end of the debate.

132
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,480
Moving on: our main story tonight,
and I cannot believe I'm saying this

133
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,760
is Donald Trump. And I say that,

134
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,440
knowing every time his name is said out
loud, he has a shattering orgasm.

135
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,240
We have mostly ignored
Trump on this show.

136
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,720
But he has now won three states,
has been endorsed by Chris Christie,

137
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,080
and polls show him leading most Super
Tuesday states. Which is a big deal.

138
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,480
Since 1988, every candidate who's won
the most states on Super Tuesday

139
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,240
went on to become
their party's nominee.

140
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,160
So at this point, Donald Trump
is America's back mole.

141
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,160
It may've seemed harmless a year ago,

142
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,200
but now that it's gotten
frighteningly bigger,

143
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,360
it is no longer wise to ignore it.

144
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,240
And I do understand why Trump
supporters might like him.

145
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,120
He's unpredictable and entertaining.

146
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,600
Just look at how he went
after Marco Rubio on Friday:

147
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,800
Did you ever see a guy
sweat like this ? It's Rubio.

148
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
That's him.

149
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,840
That's objectively funny.

150
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,360
Just as it was funny when,
a few years ago, he tweeted,

151
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,880
"I would like to extend my best wishes
to all, even the haters and losers,

152
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,200
on this special date,
September the 11th."

153
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,480
He wished haters and losers
a happy 9/11 !

154
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,400
There is a part of me
that even likes the guy.

155
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,760
It's a part of me I hate,
but it is a part of me.

156
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,320
And if you are someone who's sick of
the party establishment,

157
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,840
he might seem like a protest candidate
with some attractive qualities.

158
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,200
We like him. He tells it like it is.

159
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,960
He says what he means, I honestly
believe he's telling the truth.

160
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,560
He's funding his own campaign.
Nobody owns him.

161
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,280
He's aggressive and he's strong
and he's bold.

162
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,320
I think he's an incredible businessman.

163
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,680
If he runs the country
like he runs his organization,

164
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,000
we would be in good shape.

165
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,200
Donald Trump can seem appealing...

166
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:07,080
Until you take a closer look, much like
the lunch buffet at a strip club,

167
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,920
or the NFL
or having a pet chimpanzee.

168
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,880
Sure, it seems fun, but someday,
Coco is going to tear your limbs off.

169
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,520
Because let's look at each of those
qualities those people listed.

170
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,680
First: "he tells it like it is."
Does he ?

171
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,000
Because, the website Politifact
checked 77 of his statements,

172
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,720
and rated 76 percent of them
as varying degrees of false.

173
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,600
I've witnessed this first-hand. He once
attacked my old boss by tweeting,

174
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,160
"if Jon Stewart is so above it all
and legit,

175
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,680
why did he change his name
from Jonathan Leibowitz ?

176
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,400
He should be proud of his heritage."
And then, two years later, wrote,

177
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,920
"I never attacked dopey Jon Stewart
for his phony last name.

178
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,960
Would never do that."

179
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,600
And then,
just last year, he claimed, falsely,

180
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,840
to have turned down an invite to appear
on this "very boring" show.

181
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,680
And who is he trying to impress
with that lie ?

182
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,560
Our show's guests include
sloths and puppies.

183
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,840
We're basically a petting zoo
with a desk.

184
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,160
But when we pointed out that he had
never been invited,

185
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,520
this is how he responded:

186
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,120
All of the sudden I see people saying
that John Oliver,

187
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,760
and I'm saying, John Oliver ?
And I checked with my people.

188
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,320
He asked me to be on the show
four or five times.

189
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,880
I don't even hardly know who he was.
I wouldn't know what he looks like.

190
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,440
First, I wouldn't expect him
to know who I was,

191
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,840
although, for his inevitable
angry tweet about this segment,

192
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,280
I'll tell him what I look like:

193
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,080
I look like a near-sighted parrot
who works at a bank.

194
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,880
But secondly:
it was genuinely destabilizing

195
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,080
to be on the receiving end
of a lie that confident.

196
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,880
I even checked to make sure that no one
had even accidentally invited him.

197
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,640
And, of course, they hadn't.

198
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,240
And I'm not even sure he knows
he's lying.

199
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,600
I think he just doesn't care
about what the truth is.

200
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,400
Donald Trump views the truth like this
Lemur views the Supreme Court vacancy.

201
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,520
"I don't care about that in any way.
Please fuck off, I have a banana."

202
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,040
So let's move on, let's move on
to his next selling point:

203
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,680
that he is truly independent, and not
beholden to anyone, or as he puts it:

204
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,240
I'm self-funding my campaign.
I tell the truth.

205
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,880
- How much have you spent so far ?
- Probably twenty-five million dollars.

206
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,760
Okay, let's break that down. First,
"I'm rich, therefore I tell the truth"

207
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,560
has the same internal logic as,
"I'm a vegan, therefore I know karate".

208
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,280
There is no cause-and-effect
between those two,

209
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,520
and the correlation usually goes
the other way.

210
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,560
And while it is true that he hasn't
taken corporate money,

211
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,680
the implication that he's personally
spent 20 to 25 million dollars

212
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,160
is a bit of a stretch.

213
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,760
Because what he's actually done is
"loaned" his own campaign

214
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,720
$17 and a half million.

215
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,480
And has just
personally "given" just $250,000.

216
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,000
And that's important,
because up until the convention,

217
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,120
he can pay himself back for the loan
with campaign funds.

218
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,920
If you don't think there's a big
difference between a gift and a loan,

219
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,760
try giving your spouse an anniversary
loan and see how that goes.

220
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,920
And even he himself sometimes admits
that his campaign

221
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,320
is by no means
completely self-funded.

222
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,400
I'm self funding my campaign,
other than the little tiny ones,

223
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,240
where women send in...
We had a woman $7.59.

224
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,920
What do you do ? How could you send
the money back ?

225
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,480
You know, it's cute. It's beautiful.
They feel invested in your campaign.

226
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,360
He makes it sound like women stuff
grimy dollar bills in envelopes,

227
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,920
writing "Donald Trump" on the front,
and he's too kind to send them back.

228
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,360
But he's taken in 7,5 million dollars
in individual contributions.

229
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,560
And if he didn't want it,

230
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,840
maybe he shouldn't have had
two "donate" buttons on his website.

231
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,720
Because money isn't "unsolicited"

232
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,880
when you have to ask for someone's
credit card expiration date to get it.

233
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,680
Okay, so how about the claim that
he's "tough" ?

234
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,040
Well again, I'm not sure about that.

235
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,280
Because for a tough guy,
he has incredibly thin skin.

236
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,400
Back in 1988, "Spy" magazine called him
a "short-fingered vulgarian."

237
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,680
And ever since, the editor,
Graydon Carter, says

238
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,520
he receives envelopes from Trump,
always with a photo

239
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,800
on which he's circled his hand,
to highlight the length of his fingers,

240
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,920
usually with a note reading,
"See ? Not so short !"

241
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,960
And look: his fingers seem fine.

242
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,680
But the very fact he's so sensitive
about them is absolutely hilarious.

243
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,280
As is the fact that those notes were
apparently written in gold Sharpie.

244
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,040
Which is so quintessentially
Donald Trump:

245
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,800
something that gives the appearance of
wealth but is just a cheap tool.

246
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,640
Now, Trump's signature tough talk,

247
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,680
his signature tough talk
often involves lawsuits.

248
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,600
He loves to threaten to sue people,
like he did with Rosie O'Donnell.

249
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,480
She said I was bankrupt,
I never went bankrupt.

250
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,960
So probably I'll sue her.
Because it would be fun.

251
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,920
I'd like to take some money out of her
fat ass pockets.

252
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,040
Look... Of course,

253
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,440
he needs to take Rosie O'Donnell to
court to take money out of her pockets

254
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,600
because his tiny, tiny fingers
are too short to reach into her wallet.

255
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,000
But he never sued her.
He never sued Rosie O'Donnell.

256
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,320
In fact, he's repeatedly threatened
people with lawsuits

257
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,680
and not followed through,
including the rapper Mac Miller,

258
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,280
Lawrence O'Donnell, Vanity Fair,

259
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,640
and an activist who launched a petition
for Macy's to drop Trump's products.

260
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,440
"I'll sue you" is Trump's version of
"Bazinga".

261
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,360
It doesn't really mean anything,
but he says it all the time.

262
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,320
But perhaps Trump's biggest selling
point as a candidate is his success.

263
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,120
And where could people
get that idea from ?

264
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,360
I'm really rich. I actually think
I have the best temperament.

265
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,400
People love me. I've been very
successful. Everybody loves me.

266
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,360
I went to an Ivy League school,
I'm very highly educated.

267
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,240
I know words. I have the best words.

268
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,760
Oh, please.

269
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,840
Literally the biggest word in the
sentence "I have the best words"

270
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,520
is the word "words."

271
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,760
But it's worth noting:

272
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,400
while yes, he has made more money than
most of us will make in a lifetime,

273
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,480
not only did he get

274
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,160
a multimillion-dollar inheritance
from his father,

275
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,360
but he's also lost a huge amount. And
this is where we need to be careful,

276
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,080
because as we've learned,
he will threaten to sue

277
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,960
your fat-ass pockets with his
cocktail-sausage fingers

278
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,840
if you talk about his companies'
bankruptcies.

279
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,880
So I will just let his own daughter
describe the state of his finances

280
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,280
at one point in his life.

281
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,280
I remember once my father and I
were walking down Fifth Avenue,

282
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,040
and there was a homeless person
sitting right outside of Trump Tower.

283
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,840
And I remember my father pointing
to him and saying,

284
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,480
that guy has eight billion dollars
more than me

285
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,360
because he was in such extreme debt
at that point.

286
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,680
And that really shows you the
indomitable spirit of Donald Trump.

287
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,080
To fall to his lowest point, and in
that very moment, still find a way

288
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,320
to be kind of a dick to a homeless guy.

289
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,360
Now, his campaign claims

290
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,440
his current worth is in excess
of ten billion dollars,

291
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,880
and they've written it in all caps,
so it must be true.

292
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,880
But others have disputed that figure.

293
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,880
In fact, a book once suggested that
Trump might be worth a mere

294
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,640
$150 million to $250 million,

295
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,560
which Trump protested by suing
the writer for $5 billion dollars.

296
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,360
Which is a pretty roundabout way
of getting half the way to ten billion.

297
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,200
And you should know, for the record,
Trump lost that lawsuit, twice.

298
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,240
But I am glad that he sued,
if only because, during the deposition,

299
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,840
he explained that his estimate of his
net worth fluctuates, based on,

300
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,800
and I quote, "feelings,
even my own feelings,

301
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,000
and that can change
rapidly from day to day."

302
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,560
Think about that: he claimed his net
worth changes depending on his mood.

303
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,320
Which makes absolutely no sense,

304
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,800
partly because he always seems to be
in the same mood, specifically:

305
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,360
smug, yet gassy.

306
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,440
And interestingly...

307
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:14,160
Interestingly, a significant portion of
his selfvaluation is intangible:

308
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,080
His brand is what he values very much,

309
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,240
and on his disclosure form that
he's released, it's about $3 billion.

310
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,080
That's what he values his brand as.

311
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,560
Exactly, he values his own name
at $3 billion.

312
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,120
And I'm not saying
a name can't have value,

313
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,560
it's why people will pay $120
for a plain white t-shirt

314
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,560
that is "designed" by Kanye West.
They don't want just any white t-shirt,

315
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,840
they want one designed by a bored
sociopath with a fingerfree anus.

316
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,600
But $3 billion seems a bit high.

317
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,400
Especially because,
while Trump said,

318
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,160
"If I put my name on something,
you know it's gonna be good",

319
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,240
over the years,

320
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,680
his name has been on some things that
have arguably been very un-good,

321
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,520
including Trump Shuttle,
which no longer exists.

322
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,480
Trump Vodka, which was discontinued.

323
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,560
Trump Magazine, which folded, Trump
World Magazine, which also folded.

324
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,840
Trump University,
over which he is being sued,

325
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,480
and of course the travel-booking site
"go Trump dot com,"

326
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,440
whose brief existence was a real thorn
in the side of anyone hoping

327
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,640
"got rump dot com" featured
a single thing worth masturbating to.

328
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,760
And that's not even mentioning this:

329
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,680
When it comes to great steaks,
I've just raised the stakes.

330
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,160
Trump steaks
are the world's greatest steaks,

331
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,760
and I mean that
in every sense of the word.

332
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,720
And The Sharper Image is the only store
where you can buy them !

333
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,160
And not only can you not buy
those steaks anymore,

334
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:48,720
but why did he sell them at The Sharper
Image ? That is a weird choice.

335
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,800
"I will take a massage chair,
an indoor waterfall,

336
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,080
and eight and a half pounds
of the finest meat in America."

337
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,600
And sure, every business executive is
bound to have a few missteps.

338
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,520
But Trump's lack of sound financial
instincts is perhaps best exemplified

339
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,120
by the business that he put his name on
back in 2006.

340
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,720
Just before the entire housing market
collapsed.

341
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,600
I think it's a great time
to start a mortgage company.

342
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,640
We're going to have a great company,
it's Trump Mortgage

343
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,960
and "Trump mortgage dot com,"
and it's gonna be a terrific company.

344
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,520
Yeah, it wasn't.
In fact...

345
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,200
In fact, starting a mortgage company
in 2006

346
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,000
was one of the worst decisions
you could possibly make.

347
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,480
But I guess you can convince yourself
it was a good idea

348
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,960
when you say 30 words

349
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,440
and five of them are "great," "great,"
"terrific," "Trump," and "Trump."

350
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,280
And you might say, "well,
never mind side businesses,

351
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,600
what he really is,
is a builder."

352
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,520
But a building with Trump written on it
is not necessarily owned by him.

353
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,000
He may just have licensed his name
to them,

354
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,280
something he claims is actually
"Better than ownership...

355
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,240
You don't put up money.
You don't put up anything."

356
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,520
Spoken like a true builder.
And...

357
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,920
And some of those licensed buildings
sell his reputation hard.

358
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,720
Like the sales video for the Trump
Ocean Resort in northern Mexico:

359
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,920
I'm very, very proud
of the fact that when I build,

360
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,480
I have investors that follow me
all over. People ask me:

361
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,280
what does Trump stand for
more than anything else ?

362
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,280
And if I use one word,
it's always quality.

363
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,120
Right, but it's easy to throw around
the word "quality".

364
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,640
Have you ever stayed at a Quality Inn ?

365
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,080
The pillows are stuffed with hair
they fished out of the bathtub drain.

366
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,800
He was never the builder for that
project, which was later abandoned,

367
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,760
leaving would-be condo buyers like
William Flint, who lost $168,000,

368
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,840
feeling understandably betrayed.

369
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,440
Donald Trump was an expert
in these types of projects

370
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,520
or so we thought.

371
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,760
In a deposition for a lawsuit regarding
the property

372
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,520
Trump's son Donald Trump Jr.
conceded the Trump brand

373
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,800
could lead people to think
a project was a solid investment.

374
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,040
There's one of the things
you've learned through this process

375
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:03,600
is the Trump name brings stability
and reliability to the project.

376
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,200
I don't know if it brings stability
or viability

377
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,800
but I imagine certain people feel that.

378
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,560
And that might actually be the most
honest slogan for the Trump campaign:

379
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,280
"Trump 2016: I don't know if it brings
stability or viability,

380
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,080
but I imagine
certain people feel that."

381
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,920
Not only...

382
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,920
Not only did investors in that property
sue Donald Trump,

383
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,160
they also did in Trump Tower Tampa,

384
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,240
another project that never got off
the ground. And in both cases,

385
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,400
Trump characteristically deflected
blame onto the developers.

386
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,240
You'd think those investors would be
facing an impossible legal battle,

387
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,280
given Trump's tough talk:

388
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,080
When I get sued, I take it all the way.

389
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,080
You know what happens if you settle
suits ? You get sued more. It's true.

390
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,920
I don't settle anything.
I don't settle.

391
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,960
Guess what ? He settled both those
cases. But the problem is,

392
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,480
even when you can demonstrably
prove Trump to be wrong,

393
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,720
it somehow never seems to matter.
You can hold his feet to the fire,

394
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,680
but he'll stand there on the stumps
bragging about his fireproof foot skin.

395
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,920
And that may be because he's spent
decades turning his own name

396
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,320
into a brand synonymous
with success and quality.

397
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,080
And he's made himself
the mascot for that brand,

398
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,200
like Ronald McDonald or Chef Boyardee.

399
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,200
And that is who we have seen
in "The Apprentice", or Wrestlemania,

400
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:29,160
or "Home Alone 2". But if he's actually
going to be the Republican nominee,

401
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,960
it's time to stop thinking of the
mascot, and start thinking of the man.

402
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,880
'Cause a candidate for president needs
a coherent set of policies.

403
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,720
Whatever you think about Marco Rubio
and Ted Cruz,

404
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,320
at least you basically know
where they stand.

405
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,400
But Trump's opinions
have been wildly inconsistent.

406
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,960
He's been pro-choice and pro-life.
For and against assault-weapon bans.

407
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,040
In favor of both bringing in
Syrian refugees,

408
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,520
and deporting them out of the country.

409
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,560
And that inconsistency can be
troubling.

410
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,400
Just this morning for instance, he was
asked about the fact that David Duke,

411
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,920
former grand wizard of the Ku Klux
Klan, told supporters to vote for him.

412
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,280
And this was his answer:

413
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,400
Will you unequivocally condemn
David Duke

414
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,920
and say that you don't want his vote or
that of other white supremacists ?

415
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,520
Just so you understand, I don't know
anything about David Duke, okay ?

416
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,840
I don't know anything about what
you're even talking about

417
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,760
with white supremacy
or white supremacists.

418
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,200
Honestly, I don't know David Duke,
I don't believe I've ever met him,

419
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,600
I'm pretty sure I didn't meet him, and
I just don't know anything about him.

420
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,640
Really ?
That's your best answer there ?

421
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,280
Because you definitely know who he is,

422
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,920
partly 'cause you've called him a bigot
and a racist in the past,

423
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,920
but that's not even the fucking point.
The point is, with an answer like that,

424
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,080
you are either racist
or you are pretending to be,

425
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,960
and at some point,
there is no difference there.

426
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,480
And sure, he disavowed David Duke
later in the day,

427
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,560
but the scary thing is,
we have no way of knowing

428
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,160
which of his inconsistent views
he'll hold in office.

429
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,600
Will he stand by his statement that
vaccines are linked to autism ?

430
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,520
Or his belief that Mexico is sending us
rapists ?

431
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,680
Oh, and what about
that plan he had to defeat ISIS ?

432
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,120
We're fighting a very politically
correct war.

433
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,680
But the thing is, with the terrorists,
you have to take out their families.

434
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,000
When you get these terrorists, you have
to take out their families.

435
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,720
They care about their lives,
don't kid yourself,

436
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,320
but they say they don't care about ti,
you have to take out their families.

437
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,200
That is the frontrunner
for the republican nomination,

438
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,960
advocating a war crime.
And he might say he was joking,

439
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,280
or he's changed his mind about
any of these things.

440
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,960
And private individuals are allowed to
change their minds. We all do it.

441
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:43,480
But when he's sworn in as president on
January 20, 2017,

442
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,560
on that day,
his opinions are going to matter.

443
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,600
And you will remember that date,

444
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,480
because it's the one time travelers
from the future will come back to,

445
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,200
to try and stop the whole thing
from happening.

446
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:01,560
And listen, I get that the character of
Donald Trump is entertaining.

447
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,800
And that he says things
that people want to hear.

448
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,440
And I know his very name is powerful.

449
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,600
Just listen to this one supporter
explain what it means to her:

450
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,320
I was a little girl. I didn't even know
what Trump Towers were,

451
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,280
but I knew that
he was a wealthy successful man.

452
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,680
Somehow, even as a very young kid,
the word 'Trump' meant 'rich' to you ?

453
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,000
It meant success.

454
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,960
She's not even wrong.
"Trump" does sound rich.

455
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,280
It's almost onomatopoeic. "Trump !"

456
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,480
It's the sound produced when a mouthy
servant is slapped across the face

457
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,480
with a wad of $1,000 bills.
"Trump !"

458
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,120
It's the sound of a cork popping
on a couple's champagneaversay,

459
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,560
the date renovations in the wine-cellar
were finally completed.

460
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,840
The very name "Trump" is
the cornerstone of his brand.

461
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,800
If only there were a way to uncouple
that magical word

462
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,400
from the man he really is.

463
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,800
Well, guess what ? There is.

464
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,320
Because it turns out, the name "Trump"
was not always his family's name.

465
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,800
One biographer found that a prescient
ancestor had changed it from

466
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,280
and this is true, Drumpf.

467
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,880
Yes, fucking "Drumpf" !

468
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,560
And Drumpf is much less magical.

469
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,200
It's the sound produced
when a morbidly obese pigeon

470
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,400
flies into the window of
a foreclosed Old Navy. Drumpf !

471
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,920
It's the sound of a bottle of
store-brand root beer

472
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,600
falling off the shelf
in a gas station mini-mart.

473
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,200
And it may seem weird to bring up
his ancestral name,

474
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,520
but to quote Donald Trump,
"he should be proud of his heritage".

475
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,000
Because "Drumpf" is much more
reflective of who he actually is.

476
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,960
So if you are thinking of voting for
Donald Trump,

477
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,920
the charismatic guy promising to make
America great again,

478
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,080
stop and take a moment to imagine
how you would feel

479
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,240
if you just met a guy named
Donald Drumpf.

480
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,720
A litigious serial liar with a string
of broken business ventures

481
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,640
and the support of a former
Klan leader,

482
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,760
who he can't decide
whether or not to condemn.

483
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,720
Would you think
he would make a good president ?

484
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,360
Or is the spell now somewhat broken ?

485
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,200
And that is why tonight, I'm asking
America to make Donald Drumpf again !

486
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,280
Hashtag "make Donald Drumpf again."

487
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:15,320
We've actually filed paperwork to
trademark the name Drumpf.

488
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,600
And incidentally, when we own it,
I will have the best word.

489
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,200
And if you go to "Donald J. Drumpf
dot com", which we own,

490
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,480
you can download a Drumpfinator
Chrome extension, which will replace

491
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,360
the word "Trump" with "Drumpf"
wherever it appears in your browser.

492
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,840
And you can also buy these
"Make Donald Drumpf Again" hats

493
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:40,360
which we are selling at cost, meaning
we've chosen not to make a profit.

494
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,000
A fact which will irritate Mr. Drumpf
more than anything else I said tonight.

495
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,160
And if you're thinking,
well, that's all great,

496
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,920
but I wish there was a new campaign
anthem for Donald Drumpf,

497
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,920
here it is now. Here it is right now.

498
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,320
Because listen, we cannot keep getting
blinded by the magic of his name.

499
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,120
We need to see him through fresh eyes.

500
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,960
So please,
don't think of him as Donald Trump.

501
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,840
Think of him as something else.

502
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,400
And don't vote for him
because he tells it like it is,

503
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,200
he's a bullshit artist.

504
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,840
Don't vote for him because he's tough,
he's a baby, with even smaller fingers.

505
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,400
Don't vote for him
because he's a "builder",

506
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,880
he's more of a shitty lifestyle brand.

507
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
And that is our show !

508
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,040
Mr. Drumpf, I await your lawsuit
in the morning.

509
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,800
I have no doubt that the complaint
will be signed in gold Sharpie.

510
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,680
Goodnight !

511
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,560
What's his motherfucking name ?

512
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,960
Donald Drumpf, Donald Drumpf,

513
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,520
Donald Drumpf.
