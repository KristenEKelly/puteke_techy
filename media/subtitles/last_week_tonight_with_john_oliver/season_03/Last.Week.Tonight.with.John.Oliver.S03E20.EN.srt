LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,280
SEASON III
EPISODE 20

3
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,000
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,880
Thank you for joining us. Let us
begin straight away with the Olympics.

5
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,520
A global display of the world's
greatest athletes and also dressage.

6
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,440
I don't care if you fuck your horse,

7
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,200
but you are not getting a medal
for the foreplay.

8
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,960
Now, the buildup to the Rio games
has been turbulent,

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,640
with Brazil experiencing
a massive recession,

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,280
protests in the streets,
and a Zika outbreak.

11
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,240
But NBC urged us to forget all that
and focus on the opening ceremony.

12
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,240
The cariocas, as they call themselves,

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,760
they are ready at least for tonight
to put the headlines aside,

14
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,960
hit the reset button
and throw one massive party.

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,520
Did somebody say "party" ?!

16
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,160
No !

17
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,720
Aunt Hoda
got into the caipirinha supply.

18
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,160
Everybody watch yourselves.
She gets grabby.

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,040
The ceremony itself
was as spectacular as you'd expect,

20
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,960
featuring fireworks, little scooters
from junior high gym class,

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,480
to people throwing Ikea Fluurgen
lampshades at each other,

22
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,120
to plants forming the Olympic rings,
before having a full-on plant-gasm.

23
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,800
If people in that stadium start giving
birth to palm trees in nine months,

24
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,120
you will know why.

25
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,800
The ceremony also featured
a solemn moment of history.

26
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,320
She is one of Brazil's
most recognizable exports.

27
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,000
But tonight she walks
on her country's biggest stage,

28
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,440
that is supermodel Gisele Bundchen.

29
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,600
According to everything we have heard,
this will be Gisele's last catwalk.

30
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,520
Wait: last catwalk ?
What's happening to her ?

31
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,440
My God, they're going
to kill Gisele, aren't they ?

32
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,880
Or maybe they'll send her where
all supermodels go: a farm upstate,

33
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,800
where they can sassily walk around
and graze on tiny amounts of grass.

34
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Still, the centerpiece of any opening
ceremony is the Parade of Nations.

35
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,880
That inspirational moment

36
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,960
where athletes come together, as one,
to have Today Show anchors

37
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,200
point out everything
that's wrong with their countries.

38
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,480
As Turkey enters the stadium, there
has got to be so many mixed emotions.

39
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,280
There was an attempted coup that
failed to overthrow the government.

40
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,320
It's been a difficult
and tragic year for France.

41
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,760
Terrorist attacks in Paris
and Nice and Normandy.

42
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,120
She was in Kathmandu when the
devastating earthquake hit that region.

43
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,960
That killed an estimated 9,000 people.

44
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,160
Sudan is entering the stadium.
Troubled nation.

45
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,440
Holy shit.
It is a good thing that those anchors

46
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,560
don't behave like that
during the Macy's Day Parade.

47
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,800
"There goes Shrek,
obviously jaundiced"

48
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,440
"and beset by weight problems
stemming from chronic diabetes."

49
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,120
"Here's Charlie Brown, clearly
losing his fight with leukemia."

50
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,160
"There is Snoopy, who of course
is going to be put down later today."

51
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,880
That might be preferable to whenever
they tried to get jocular instead.

52
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,680
Once every four years, someone gets
to say it and today it's my turn,

53
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,200
so how about this:
check out Djibouti.

54
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,520
- You did it.
- I did it.

55
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,600
You did. Djibouti is a country
with a rich cultural history

56
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,760
and a multi-ethnic population
of over 850,000 people.

57
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,360
But you are right,
it does also sound like a butt.

58
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,760
The parade itself was a fairly standard
affair, most countries' athletes

59
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,600
were forced to dress like flight
attendants from shitty airlines,

60
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,000
with one glorious exception.

61
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,840
- Look at Tonga.
- Slow that down !

62
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,320
We'll live here for a minute.

63
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,480
He's so shiny, what is that ?

64
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,120
He just became a sensation in Brazil,
I can tell you that.

65
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,640
- They love him here.
- As do Meredith and I.

66
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,120
What's not to love ?
He's a great athlete.

67
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,640
I think Meredith and Hoda just did
whatever those trees did earlier.

68
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,840
But, look we would
be remiss to gloss over the fact

69
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,080
that there is real political turmoil
in Brazil right now.

70
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,120
Their president, Dilma Rousseff,
has been suspended,

71
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,000
and did not attend
the opening ceremony saying:

72
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,600
"Imagine you're going to throw a party,
you work on it for years,"

73
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,280
"you set it all up and then on the day
of the party someone shows up,"

74
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,960
"takes your place
and takes over your party."

75
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,760
"In this story of the games,
I am the Cinderella."

76
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,160
Which is absolute bullshit,

77
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,480
not least because Cinderella
did not organize the ball.

78
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,520
The prince's publicist Andrea did,

79
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,960
to distract from the gay rumors
surrounding the prince.

80
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,080
Come on ! Think about it. The guest
list was "every eligible maiden".

81
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,200
It was Cinderella or Katie Holmes !
Please ! Please ! It was obvious.

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,320
Now instead, Brazil's current acting
president, Michel Temer, was there

83
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,080
although he, too,
is not exactly beloved.

84
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,680
Acting president Michel Temer
declaring the games officially open,

85
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,040
but greeted by jeers.

86
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,720
Those boos actually make sense
for a couple of reasons:

87
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,520
he's unelected and is planning
to push through austerity measures.

88
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,000
And second, he's a poet,
who once released a book of poetry

89
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,360
titled "Anonymous Intimacy",
featuring this actual poem.

90
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,200
Of red fiery flames of fire.

91
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,160
Brilliant eyes which smile
with scarlet lips.

92
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,160
Fires they take hold of me.
Of my mind my soul.

93
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,600
All mine in heat.
My body on fire consumed dissolved.

94
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,360
Finally ashes are left
that I spread on the bed to sleep.

95
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,560
Now, what is interesting
about that poem is nothing.

96
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,960
But what is relevant about it
is that his muse is his wife, Marcela,

97
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,720
who is 42 years younger than him.

98
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,960
He is 75, she is 33.

99
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,120
At least when 70-something
American politicians

100
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,720
get creepily handsy
with 30-something women,

101
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,800
they have the decency to do so
with their own daughters.

102
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,600
Have some class, Brazil !
Have some class.

103
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,360
But wait: it gets one step worse.

104
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,000
Because she apparently has a tattoo
of his name on her neck.

105
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,240
Which seems a tradition that is part of
a wedding ceremony at a Senor Frog's.

106
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,640
Does any of this have anything
to do with the Olympics ? No.

107
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,160
But did I just find out about it,
and need to tell somebody ?

108
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,480
Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.

109
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,760
But for all of this, the Olympic games
promise to be genuinely inspiring.

110
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,960
For the first time,

111
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,320
a team of refugees will be competing
under the Olympic flag.

112
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,960
One of them is Yusra Mardini,
an 18-year-old Syrian refugee

113
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,760
who helped keep the boat carrying her
and a group of others afloat

114
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,480
when its engine
failed off the Greek coast.

115
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,440
She's pretty incredible. Listen to her
describe her training regime in Syria.

116
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,840
Sometimes we couldn't train
because of the war.

117
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,120
Sometimes you had a training and there
was a bombing in the swimming pool.

118
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,960
So it was... You can see like the roof,
there is three or four places is open.

119
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,480
When you have a problem
that doesn't mean

120
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,640
you have to sit around
and cry like babies or something.

121
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,040
First, I am almost terrifyingly
impressed by that woman.

122
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,680
And second, when something goes
wrong. I don't cry like a baby.

123
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,040
I cry like a grown man.
And I'll tell you why. It's louder.

124
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,800
It terrifies strangers.
And no one comforts me. It's better.

125
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,600
I will say this: there was one moment
in the opening ceremony

126
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,040
where the inspirational rhetoric
went just a touch too far.

127
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,120
In this Olympic world there is
one universal law for everybody.

128
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,000
In this Olympic world,
we are all equal.

129
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,600
Okay, that is simply not true.

130
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,200
If that were the case,
you wouldn't need to have an Olympics.

131
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,520
The whole reason we do this is to find
out who is better than everyone else,

132
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,640
so that we can make them stand higher

133
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,400
than the other people
who are not as good as them.

134
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,400
Because the point of the games
is not to celebrate equality.

135
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,200
It is to celebrate
individuals' excellence.

136
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,800
Let us settle in for two incredible
weeks of celebrating the fittest,

137
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,560
the bravest, the most beautiful,
and, of course, the drunkest of us all.

138
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,520
Did somebody say "party" ?
And now this.

139
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,640
Newscasters perv out over a shirtless
Olympian in national dress.

140
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,600
All eyes went straight to what
people are calling, now, Mr. Tonga.

141
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,000
The boy from Tonga.

142
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,080
The beefcake who stole the...
Yes, I said beefcake.

143
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,000
A whole bunch of oil,
glistening body.

144
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,040
Look at that. He's hot.

145
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,560
I mean, just body oil.

146
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,440
- I can't take it.
- He's tuned up right there.

147
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,480
He actually is an athlete
that competes in taekwondo.

148
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,840
- I don't think anybody was asking.
- I don't think either.

149
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,200
- We're stretching this story out.
- My God !

150
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,000
Our producer wants to scoot us along.
But five more seconds in heaven.

151
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,840
Give the people what they want !
I mean me.

152
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,960
Can we look at that shot again ?
No ?

153
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,400
- I gotta go to Tonga.
- I don't think so.

154
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,600
I'm just kidding.

155
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,760
Moving on. Our main story
concerns journalists:

156
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,560
the heroes that we root for in movies
like "All The President's Men",

157
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,000
"The Great Muppet Caper",
and, most recently, "Spotlight".

158
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,920
We gotta nail these scumbags !

159
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,360
We gotta show people that nobody
can get away with this...

160
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,200
Not a priest, or a cardinal,
or a freaking pope !

161
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,520
Now remember, "Spotlight" won
best picture at the Oscars this year.

162
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,960
Newspapers received the recognition

163
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,320
that we normally reserve
for subjects of such importance as:

164
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,080
the bravery of real-life
Hollywood filmmakers,

165
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,960
the bravery of fictional
Hollywood filmmakers,

166
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,240
and the bravery of wanting
to fuck your daughter's friend.

167
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,280
But, one of the things
that made "Spotlight" so powerful

168
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,160
is the knowledge that the newspaper
industry today is in big trouble.

169
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,040
Papers have been closing for years,
and that affects all of us,

170
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,840
even if you only get your news
from Facebook, Google, Twitter,

171
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,720
"Arianna Huffington's Junction
And Book Excerpt Clearinghouse."

172
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,160
Those places are often repackaging
the work of newspapers.

173
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,920
And it is not just websites...

174
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,200
watch how often TV news
ends up citing print sources.

175
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,960
- According to the Chicago Tribune.
- Detroit Free Press.

176
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,040
- San Francisco Chronicle.
- The Times-Picayune.

177
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,040
The Boston Globe.

178
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,600
- The Philadelphia Inquirer.
- The Detroit News.

179
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,560
- The Houston Chronicle reports.
- The Oklahoman reports.

180
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,160
The Hartford Courant reports.

181
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,240
It's obvious:
without newspapers around to cite,

182
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,640
TV news would just be Wolf Blitzer
endlessly batting a ball of yarn around.

183
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,800
And, it is not just news outlets.

184
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,760
Stupid shows like ours
lean heavily on local papers.

185
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,560
Whenever this show
is called journalism,

186
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:56,160
it is a slap in the face to the actual
journalists whose work we rely on.

187
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,240
I'll give you one example: 2 years ago,
we ran a piece on state lotteries,

188
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,680
and a not-insignificant portion of it
was built on the work of Harry Esteve,

189
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,640
a reporter at the Oregonian.

190
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,240
Here is a clip we used of him
talking about his series on camera.

191
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,400
Here I am quoting one of his
Oregonian stories directly.

192
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,440
And here I am, doing it again.

193
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,320
You probably didn't notice it,
you were too fixated

194
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,160
on my bold choice of shiny grey tie
with checkered dress shirt.

195
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,120
The tie says "mafia funeral," the shirt
says "high school debate tournament",

196
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,960
and the face says "I am not confident
enough to carry this look off."

197
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,280
But the point is, we used a lot
of Harry Esteve's work in that piece.

198
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,440
And we try to add new information
to our stories.

199
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,680
Our researchers
work incredibly hard.

200
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,720
But the media is a food chain, which
would fall apart without newspapers.

201
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,760
And the problem is, print ads
are less popular with advertisers

202
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,000
than they used to be.

203
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,520
And online ads
produce much less revenue.

204
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,720
Between 2004 and 2014,

205
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,160
newspapers gained two billion dollars
in online ad revenue.

206
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,600
Unfortunately, in that same period,
they lost $30 billion in print revenue.

207
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,200
So that's like finding a lucky penny
on the sidewalk on the day

208
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,720
your bank account is drained
by a 16-year-old Belgian hacker.

209
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,160
And this has led to cutbacks
in newsrooms.

210
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,840
Again, and look at The Oregonian.
It used to be a big money-maker.

211
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,280
In 1993, their editor talked about how
proud he was of its record of success.

212
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,720
I've been at that paper
more than 40 years.

213
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,480
I've seen our staff increase,
I've seen our salaries increase,

214
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,560
not a year has gone by that
an employee at the Oregonian,

215
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,160
full-time employee,
has not been a beneficiary of a raise.

216
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,240
Now, that level of confidence
is almost tempting fate.

217
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,480
He's like a citizen of Pompeii saying:

218
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,760
"What I love about this city
is how volcano-proof it is."

219
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,480
"Not a year goes by
without us not having to have"

220
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,480
"our horrified reactions
captured in ash forever."

221
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,400
Unfortunately, the Oregonian's
circulation has since dropped

222
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,840
and in 2013 just as Harry Esteve
was working on his lottery series

223
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,680
their parent company, Advance
Publications, dropped a bombshell.

224
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,440
This picture, tweeted out from inside
the Oregonian, shows staffers listening

225
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,600
as editor Peter Bhatia
broke the news some had feared:

226
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,240
the paper will split in two,
stop 7 day a week home delivery,

227
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,120
and lay off some employees.

228
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,120
This is an, a strategic move
to really focus everybody

229
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,560
on what that digital future is,
what our products and services can be.

230
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,800
It's true. They became
a "digital first" company.

231
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,000
"Digitalfirst" sounds like
a high-school euphemism

232
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,200
for seductively sucking on a finger.

233
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,080
"I put my finger in his mouth.
We totally got to digital-first."

234
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,960
"It was like...
But it was also, like... Hot."

235
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,960
That meant big changes.
A local weekly, the Willamette Week,

236
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,480
got their hands on a presentation
for the Oregonian staff,

237
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,280
outlining reporters
are expected to meet a quota

238
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,160
of three blog posts a day,
and on any post of substance,

239
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,600
they would have to post
the first comment.

240
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,440
What better way to win the trust
of your readers

241
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,720
than posting "first !"
underneath your own article ?

242
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,520
Those rules were criticized
and have since been relaxed.

243
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,160
Extra digital demands
placed on journalists

244
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,480
is now common
throughout the industry.

245
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,200
Listen to Washington Post editor
Marty Baron,

246
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,600
the guy Liev Schreiber
played in "Spotlight".

247
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,400
He describes his concerns about
the average workload required.

248
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,240
They have to do their reporting,
participate in social media

249
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,360
produce a wire service that's
available 24 hours a day.

250
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,840
They have to be responsible
for video, you name it...

251
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,200
It's a lot to ask.

252
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,600
True. If journalists
are constantly required to write,

253
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,120
edit, shoot videos and tweet,
mistakes are going to get made.

254
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,720
Perhaps that is how the
"Boston Globe" wound up tweeting

255
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,800
that the FBI had
"investifarted about 70 leads".

256
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,800
If they had more time, they would
have written "hashtag investifarted".

257
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,440
Because that's how you drive the
conversation. Hashtag investifarted.

258
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,480
At the Oregonian,
those digital demands came

259
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,760
just as almost a quarter
of the newsroom was laid off.

260
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,040
Even more staffers left the paper,
including statehouse reporters,

261
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,440
a two-time Pulitzer winner
and Harry Esteve.

262
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,680
So his work bolstered
our lottery piece and now,

263
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,960
the lack of his work has bolstered
this journalism piece.

264
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,000
So you can't say that we don't
use every part of the Harry Esteve.

265
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,280
Here is where it gets frightening:

266
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,280
while the Oregonian rebuilt
its statehouse team,

267
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,200
other papers have been
forced to simply go without.

268
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,000
A study of over 200 papers found
that between 2003 and 2014,

269
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,400
their number of full-time statehouse
reporters "declined by 35 percent".

270
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,920
And that's not good.

271
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,360
While there
are some great web outlets,

272
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,720
some of which do cover
local government,

273
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,960
there aren't nearly enough
to replace what has been lost.

274
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,560
Listen to David Simon, who
before creating the show "The Wire",

275
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,800
worked for years
at the Baltimore Sun.

276
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,240
The day I run into a Huffington Post
reporter at a Baltimore hearing

277
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,400
is the day that I will be confident
we've reached some equilibrium.

278
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,480
There's no glory
in that kind of journalism,

279
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,840
but that is the bedrock
of what keeps...

280
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,880
The next 10 or 15 years in this country
are going to be a halcyon era

281
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,360
for state
and local political corruption.

282
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,000
It is going to be one of the great
times to be a corrupt politician.

283
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,800
I really envy them. I really do.

284
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,280
He's right, because not having
reporters at government meetings

285
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,320
is like a teacher leaving seventh
graders to supervise themselves.

286
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,880
Best case scenario,
Britney gets gum in her hair.

287
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,320
Worst-case scenario,
you no longer have a school.

288
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,240
It is clearly smart for newspapers
to expand online.

289
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,960
But the danger is
the temptation to gravitate

290
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,480
toward whatever gets
the most clicks.

291
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,840
Which is why news organizations
badly need to have leaders

292
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,120
who appreciate that what's popular
isn't always what's most important,

293
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
but that is not always the case.

294
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,960
Look at Sam Zell, a billionaire
investor and living garden gnome.

295
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,600
Nine years ago, he took
over the Tribune Company,

296
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,000
which owns LA Times,
Orlando Sentinel and Chicago Tribune.

297
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,600
He spoke to the Sentinel's nervous
staff, outlining his vision.

298
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,880
Listen to one particular exchange
with a journalist.

299
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,080
His last two words are
perhaps the most illuminating.

300
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,160
My attitude on journalism
is very simple.

301
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,600
I want to make enough money
so I can afford you.

302
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,560
It's really that simple. Okay ?
You need to help me,

303
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,840
by being a journalist that focuses
on what our readers want.

304
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,240
And generates more revenue.

305
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,600
But what readers want
are puppy dogs,

306
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,160
and we also need to
inform the community...

307
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,400
I'm sorry, I can't...

308
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:16,320
You're giving me the classic what
I would call journalistic arrogance,

309
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,480
of deciding
that puppies don't count.

310
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,200
Hopefully we get to the point
where our revenue is so significant

311
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,480
that we can do puppies
and Iraq, okay ?

312
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,520
Fuck you.

313
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,800
Sam Zell just created a new motto for
the Sentinel's masthead:

314
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,760
"the puppy news fit to print,"

315
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,120
"and maybe some Iraq news too,
if we can afford it, fuck you."

316
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,200
The good news is, Zell no longer
owns the Tribune company.

317
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,680
Their latest attempt to balance
business pressures

318
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,800
with journalistic responsibility
has not been confidence-inspiring.

319
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,040
Just this year, "Tribune Publishing"
was rebranded

320
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,280
into something much stupider.

321
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,600
This is the future of journalism,
of content.

322
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,120
If you care about media and technology,
this is the place to be.

323
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,720
Tronc stands
for tribune online content.

324
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,200
Yes, Tronc. They have chosen
to call themselves "Tronc".

325
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,200
Which sounds like the noise
an ejaculating elephant makes,

326
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:32,040
or the sound of a stack of newspapers
being thrown into a dumpster.

327
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,400
If you are wondering how Tronc's
business model will be different,

328
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,880
get ready to have
your minds Tronc'ed.

329
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,360
We're going to
harness the power of our journalism

330
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,040
by having a optimization group,
this Tronc team.

331
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,800
Will work with all the local markets
to harness our local journalism,

332
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,760
feed it into a funnel,
and then optimize it

333
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,120
so that we reach the biggest
audience.

334
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,800
What the fuck did she just say ?

335
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,800
They're going to feed
journalism into a funnel ?

336
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,880
"We're just gonna take content
and cram it down your throat"

337
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,680
"like you're an abused goose."

338
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,280
And the corresponding
visuals makes even less sense.

339
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,880
What is happening here ?

340
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,320
It looks like a bunch of digital
sperm impregnating a Tronc egg.

341
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,600
But what seems like a banal
corporate re-branding speech

342
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,520
goes off the rails
with their next big idea.

343
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,200
Artificial intelligence
is going to allow journalists

344
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,840
to do their jobs more efficiently,
finding the right photos,

345
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,480
the videos, the things that you
will package your stories with.

346
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,040
Now that's a manual effort.
With artificial intelligence,

347
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,480
you can create a system that
automatically is doing that.

348
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,560
Okay.
Putting aside the news-robots.

349
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,680
I would like to take a moment
to break down what may be

350
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,160
the most meaningless
graphic ever created.

351
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,760
On the left, there is the phrase
"reading habits."

352
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,640
But once those reading habits
undergo X,

353
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,120
they become
"increase consumption."

354
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,960
It almost feels like a test

355
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,360
and the first employee
to say:

356
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,640
"that doesn't mean anything"
becomes king of the news.

357
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,080
It is easy to make fun of Tronc.
I could do it for another 20 minutes.

358
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,280
But the publishers are desperate.

359
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,320
No one seems to have a perfect
plan to keep newspapers afloat.

360
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,320
One option seems to be to pray
you get bought by a benefactor

361
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,560
who could afford
to swallow losses.

362
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,720
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos bought
"The Washington Post" in 2013,

363
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,080
and they've done
spectacular journalism

364
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,760
and the reporters seem happy,
despite some of his stupider ideas

365
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,400
like "a game that would allow
a reader who didn't enjoy an article"

366
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,520
"to pay to remove its vowels."

367
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,560
Which is just absurd.

368
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,800
Taking out all the vowels makes
every word sound like an app.

369
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,320
I'll give you an example.
"Turkey" is a nation in crisis.

370
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,560
"TRK" is a dating service that helps
you fuck long-haul truckers.

371
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,320
But there are potential downsides
to having a rich owner,

372
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,240
if there is a concern that they could
meddle with the paper's coverage.

373
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,680
Look at what happened to
the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

374
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,680
Acquired by Sheldon Adelson, magnate
and Republican mega-donor.

375
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,440
He's a big deal in Vegas,
and his businesses are at the center

376
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,320
of a lot of stories
the Review-Journal covers.

377
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,320
While Adelson and the editors
have denied that he interferes

378
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,560
with news coverage in any way,
the editors have admitted

379
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:46,880
they put any articles about him
through a special review process,

380
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,880
to make sure that they are "fair".

381
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,080
Listen to an ex-deputy editor
describe his experience.

382
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:59,520
In this review process, things
are changed, added, removed.

383
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,640
There's no explanation for why
and there's no appeal.

384
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,080
Reporters have asked if they could
have their name taken off the story

385
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,320
and have been told
that's not allowed.

386
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,200
There are things that are done
because it's known

387
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,880
that this is the way Adelson
wants it to read.

388
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,000
And it can be something minor
or something very big.

389
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,360
If that's true,
that is very compromising.

390
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,760
There could not be a worse owner
of a paper in Vegas than Adelson,

391
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,640
with the possible exception
of Cirque du Soleil.

392
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,120
They wouldn't give you a newspaper,
you'd just have a fistful of glitter

393
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,520
thrown in your face
by a 90-pound man in a thong.

394
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:44,000
None of this is to say there isn't
great work in local newsrooms now.

395
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,720
Many are at the Oregonian,
at the Review-Journal, even at Tronc.

396
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,320
But, they are doing it
despite their current conditions.

397
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,800
A big part of the blame for this
industry's dire straits is on us

398
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,640
and our unwillingness to pay
for the work journalists produce.

399
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,000
We've just grown accustomed
to getting our news for free.

400
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,360
The longer
we get something for free,

401
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,600
the less willing we are to pay for it,
and I'm talking to you,

402
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,720
the person watching
this on YouTube

403
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,000
using the WiFi from the coffee shop
underneath you.

404
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,800
You're killing us !

405
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:23,840
But sooner or later, we are either
going to have to pay for journalism

406
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,880
or we are all going to pay for it.

407
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,640
If we don't, not only
will malfeasance run amok,

408
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,640
but the journalism movies of
the future will look like this.

409
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,880
In a city built on secrets.

410
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,120
There's corruption in City Hall.

411
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,040
Only a newsroom willing to stop
at nothing can uncover the truth.

412
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,000
It might go all the way to the top.

413
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,240
They knew. And I think we can
prove that they knew.

414
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,560
I'm not sure what kind of clicks
we're gonna get. Anybody else ?

415
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,880
I've got a thing about a cat
that looks like a raccoon.

416
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,360
Or a raccoon that looks
like a cat. Not sure.

417
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,520
Now we're talking !
That's great. Let's figure that out.

418
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,800
- An online poll.
- Political corruption in Boston.

419
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,680
- We'll come back to that...
- I like the Rac Cat.

420
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,400
That's great.
Let's pull the roof off that.

421
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,440
It's the movie critics are hailing
as "genuinely deflating"

422
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,560
and "depressingly accurate."

423
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,920
The Oregonian raves:
"Who needs a drink ?"

424
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,880
Four reporters.

425
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,320
Actually, I'm taking a buyout.

426
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,040
Three reporters.

427
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,840
I'm not a reporter, I'm the Director
of Social Media Strategies,

428
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,520
but I'm an
important part of the editorial.

429
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,840
Two reporters.

430
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,280
I'm also leaving. I'm being replaced
by whatever the fuck this is.

431
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,440
One reporter and a burnt-orange
X, chase the story of a lifetime.

432
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,320
- How far does this thing go ?
- I can't tell you.

433
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,160
All the way up to the mayor ?

434
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,680
I got kids, man,
I've already said too much.

435
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:05,320
Tommy. Sorry to interrupt.
I gotta talk to you about Twitter.

436
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,280
It's like a ghost town in here.
We talked about this.

437
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,960
Eight tweets a day.
T-Bone, how many tweets ?

438
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,960
- Eight.
- And we're not counting re-tweets.

439
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,480
He wasn't just up against the
powerful voices in City Hall.

440
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,440
I need answers. You're the only one
who can give 'em.

441
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,000
He was up against the most
powerful voices at his newspaper.

442
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,840
We gotta show people
that no one can get away with this.

443
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,400
Let me stop you right there.
Hopefully, we can get to the point

444
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,680
where we can do raccoon cats
and City Hall.

445
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,600
But we're not there.
So, fuck you.

446
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,320
Atlanta Journal-Constitution raves:

447
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:49,880
"We had to get rid of our full-time
movie reviewer, we haven't seen it."

448
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,280
The Las Vegas Review-Journal says:

449
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,080
"for fun and excitement, look at
Sheldon Adelson's casinos and resorts."

450
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,480
I don't care about you.
I still believe in newspapers.

451
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,640
Technically, you don't work
for a newspaper anymore,

452
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,720
but at a multi-platform content
distribution network.

453
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,720
The Rac Cat: is it adorable or scary ?

454
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,480
You know what ?
It's cute.

455
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,640
- Could it be scary ?
- We could make it.

456
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,160
Get some likes, clicks, re-tweets,
forwards.

457
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,320
- I'm talking about corruption.
- We'll get back to you.

458
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,800
- The archdiocese.
- Gotta keep it moving.

459
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:29,200
We need a story we can funnel.
Now, there you go.

460
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,760
- Like a piggy's tail.
- Funnel vision.

461
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,880
Exactly. Think of, like,
a witch's hat, upside-down.

462
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,040
- I work for the Chronicle.
- We rebranded. Yeah.

463
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,200
You work for Chorp.

464
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,440
- What the fuck is Chorp ?
- That's a good idea for a story.

465
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,560
Stoplight. He tried to break the story.
He was told to pump the brakes.

466
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:57,320
Tommy, we're gonna take you
off that whole City Hall thing,

467
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,560
have you work
the Raccoon Cat beat.

468
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,320
- Cat Raccoon.
- What'd I say ?

469
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,520
Raccoon Cat.

470
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,400
I want you to dig on this thing.
Dig like a Raccoon Cat.

471
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,200
Yeah, there you go. Chorp !

472
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,920
Stoplight. Coming soon to a midsize
American city newspaper near you.

473
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,160
That's our show,
see you next week, goodnight !

474
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,640
You mind if I get
a picture for my Instagram ?

475
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,000
- Buddy, here we go.
- God dammit !

476
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,720
You guys are blurry.
You ran off too quick.

477
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,560
Chorp !

478
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,080
END OF EPISODE 20,
SEASON III
