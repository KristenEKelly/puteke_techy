00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,960
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,200
SEASON III, EPISODE 23

3
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,640
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,160
Thank you so much for joining us.
We are back, after a whole month away.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,080
We have missed so much
since we've been gone,

6
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,840
from Apple introducing a cutting edge
way to lose their products,

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,560
to once again celebrating
America's greatest goose murderer,

8
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,960
to a nightmare
endorsing a panic attack.

9
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,320
But we must begin tonight
with the protests in Charlotte

10
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,920
following yet another fatal shooting by
the police of an African American man.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,200
The police videos were released late,
after significant resistance,

12
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,480
including an excuse from the police
chief that was far from reassuring.

13
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,040
Full transparency, but you're not
gonna release the video.

14
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,080
How can you square
those two things ?

15
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,040
I appreciate your passion,
but I said transparency.

16
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,680
And transparency
is in the eye of the beholder.

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,040
No, it isn't, though.

18
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,000
That's literally the opposite
of what the word "transparent" means.

19
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,640
None of us could behold the tape,

20
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,640
because of how untransparent
you were being.

21
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,680
The protests following the shootings
in Charlotte and Tulsa

22
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,480
raise issues from police accountability
to institutional racism,

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,560
all of which require time
and sensitivity to discuss.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,560
Or, if you're North Carolina
representative Robert Pittenger,

25
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,000
they're pretty simple.

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,520
The grievance in the mind
is the animus, the anger.

27
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,640
They hate white people
'cause white people are successful.

28
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,960
I mean, yes, it is.
It is a welfare state.

29
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,240
We have spent trillions of dollars
on welfare,

30
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,080
and we've put people in bondage

31
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,320
so that they can't be
all that they're capable of being.

32
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,040
That is some toxic stuff.

33
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,560
And just look at the expression
on that journalist's face.

34
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,600
It's half confusion,
and half wonder

35
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,680
at witnessing that kind
of racism being spoken aloud,

36
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,520
instead of coming out of a Twitter
egg named "Aryan the Hendersons".

37
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,280
Pittenger had to quickly walk
those comments back.

38
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,720
Which should've been easy: apologize,
and avoid some clichÃ©d excuse,

39
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,320
like you have many friends
in the African American community.

40
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,600
And I apologize.

41
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,880
I have many dear friends
in the African-American community.

42
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,600
No, you don't. At best, you had one,
and he's pretty pissed off with you.

43
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,200
There'll more to say about Charlotte,
but let's move on to Wells Fargo.

44
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,080
The only bank ever to be serenaded
by an eight-year-old Ron Howard.

45
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,200
Fuck you. I'm sorry !

46
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,760
I know you're a very powerful man
in Hollywood now,

47
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,800
but to be fair, you were
an infuriating eight year old.

48
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,280
Now, three weeks ago, Wells Fargo was
the most valuable bank in the world,

49
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,800
but its reputation has taken a massive
hit after some alarming revelations.

50
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,520
The feds say employees at Wells Fargo
took money out of customers' accounts,

51
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,400
opened bank and credit card accounts
without the customers knowing,

52
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,760
and charged fees for the accounts
the customers didn't know they had.

53
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,960
The feds say two million accounts
are involved.

54
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,680
Wells Fargo employees
created fake email addresses

55
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,960
to enroll customers
in hidden accounts,

56
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,600
creating pin numbers that customers
didn't even know existed.

57
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,440
And hidden fees are bad enough,

58
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,360
without being hidden inside hidden
accounts with hidden pin numbers,

59
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,360
made with hidden email addresses.

60
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,720
Because that's like
a Russian nesting doll

61
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,640
where the last doll
is giving you the middle finger.

62
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,920
For customers who got caught up
in this, like Frank Ahn,

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,720
even when they found out,
they couldn't stop it.

64
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,000
I've had more than ten accounts
at Wells Fargo. I only need one.

65
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,360
Ahn says he complained, but the bank
kept opening accounts in his name

66
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,400
and sending him credit cards
he didn't even want.

67
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,240
They kept making promises, they said,
we won't charge you any fees.

68
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,600
They said this is the end of it,
I thought it was, but it wasn't.

69
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,760
Frank, I do not want
to let Wells Fargo off the hook here,

70
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,240
but after ten accounts,
any bank would have been better.

71
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,680
Chase Bank. Citi Bank.

72
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,200
Even Elizabeth Banks would've been
a better place to stash your money.

73
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,760
Wells Fargo apparently fired over
5 000 people for engaging in this,

74
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,200
but you do have to wonder:
how did they all get the same idea ?

75
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,120
They were incentivized
to earn financial rewards

76
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,720
under the incentive
compensation program.

77
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,720
And we're hearing that managers
even taught employees how to do this.

78
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,880
So the fraud was baked in.

79
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,720
Which, I believe is the title
of Martha Stewart's autobiography.

80
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,960
And all this a little surprising given
that the bank's CEO, John Stumpf,

81
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,520
has talked a big game
about decency and integrity.

82
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,400
The DNA of leadership is trust.
That's true in a family relationship,

83
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,880
that's true for government,
for business.

84
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,680
We like to say we don't care what you
know until we know what you care.

85
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,960
You can't teach caring.
And you can't teach sharing.

86
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,080
What ? He sounds like a burned-out,
drunken Barney.

87
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,200
"We can't teach caring,
and you can't teach sharing."

88
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,080
"The little shits won't listen.
Don't touch me !"

89
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,280
Stumpf appeared in front of the senate
banking committee this week,

90
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,920
with a bandage on his hand,
which I legally can't say is the result

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,360
of carpal tunnel from typing in
so many fake email addresses.

92
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,840
He wanted to be clear: he didn't know
anything about anything.

93
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,680
I'm not an expert in compensation.

94
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,280
I don't know that issue off
the top of my head.

95
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,040
I'm not an expert in this field.

96
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,640
I'll talk to our team
and we'll get back to you,

97
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,200
I am not an expert in that.

98
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,800
I don't know exactly
what we're talking about.

99
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,120
If he was going to play "that" dumb,
he should have at least turned up

100
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,040
wearing his shoes on his hands
and a stone cold Steve Austin t-shirt.

101
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,120
Then it would've made sense.
But this gets one step worse.

102
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,720
The total fine for Wells Fargo's
behavior was $185 million,

103
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,840
which is nothing, considering they made
$23 billion in profit just last year.

104
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,160
And it's even less than Stumpf himself
could walk away with if he resigns.

105
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,880
A CNN money investigation
shows that if he does resign,

106
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,200
he could get $200 million
in terms of payouts

107
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,920
when he walks out of the door.

108
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,040
The only way
that could possibly be okay

109
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,120
is if they put that money in
20 million fake accounts of $10 each.

110
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,120
And never ever tell him about them.
And now, this.

111
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,680
Now... Wait, is WCBS 2 News at 11
just fucking with us at this point ?

112
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,240
Are you on the ugly list ?
Tonight at 11.

113
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,760
The body password, tonight at 11.
Psychic crime fighting, tonight at 11.

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,120
Dream master. 3D facial features.
Digital immortality.

115
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,880
Live like a millennial.
Live to 120 ?

116
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,600
The ultimate gift.
Doomsday, the secret stash.

117
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,440
Sick from Wi-Fi ? DNA matchmaking.
Fighting mom's genes.

118
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,200
The vertical farm. The brotox party.

119
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,560
Hot holiday scams. The sinister scam.
Sky high snappers. Snapchat surgery.

120
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,200
The pressure pod. Pre-K prom.
Burglar's bull's-eye. Dirty deeds.

121
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,000
The cracker concern.
The cocoa cure. The cocooning craze.

122
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,400
Cubicle crooks. Who would want
to be abducted at gunpoint ?

123
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,000
Extreme kidnapping, the game,
tonight at 11.

124
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:21,480
Moving on: our main story tonight
concerns the 2016 presidential election.

125
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,960
"The electoral equivalent of seeing
someone puking so you start puking,"

126
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,160
"then someone else is puking and pretty
soon everyone is puking... 2016."

127
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,880
The first presidential debate
is tomorrow night.

128
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,480
More than 100 million people
could be watching two candidates

129
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,720
whose campaigns have been defined
less by questions about their policies.

130
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,280
Every day is another
drip of scandal for Hillary Clinton.

131
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,000
Too many scandals have followed her
and Bill Clinton over the years.

132
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,840
- What about the Trump scandals ?
- Another Trump campaign scandal.

133
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,600
Another booming scandal
of the day,

134
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,120
but there are so many
it's hard to keep track.

135
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,280
We have had scandals
during campaigns in the past

136
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,520
from Barack Obama's financial
dealings with Tony Rezko,

137
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,240
to George W. Bush's air
national guard service,

138
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,480
to the revelation that Eisenhower's
middle initial stood for "Deez Nuts".

139
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,120
But in this campaign
the scandals have been so pronounced,

140
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,000
polls show that less
than half the electorate

141
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,760
sees either candidate
as honest or trustworthy.

142
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,640
You may not like either candidate
for good reasons.

143
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,080
But, if you are still somehow torn
about which one to vote for,

144
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,080
and are factoring their scandals
into your decision,

145
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,280
it might help to spend tonight
walking you through them.

146
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,080
So let's start with Hillary Clinton,
the woman who, if she loses,

147
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,080
will sit there, motionless,
not speaking until she eventually dies.

148
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,360
And I do know that, even talking about
her scandals will irritate some of you,

149
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,840
given that her opponent
is an unambiguously racist scarecrow

150
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,800
stuffed with scrunched up
copies of Juggs magazine.

151
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,920
And that's fair. That is a fair point.

152
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,320
But not being as bad as
Donald Trump is a low bar to clear.

153
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,560
And if you focus on nothing but him,

154
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,480
you fail to vet
a woman who might be president.

155
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,360
And if you believe the Internet,
she's guilty of everything.

156
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,520
Click around, and you can find
such masterworks as:

157
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,720
"Killary Klinton," "Hillary ordered
the murder of the children of Waco",

158
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,880
"Hillary, the Butcher of Benghazi,"

159
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,280
And my favorite:

160
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,280
"Is Hillary Clinton Satan ?
Hillary: 'I am the devil.'"

161
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,200
That's in quotes on the internet,
so she must've said it.

162
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,600
Although she could've been referring

163
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,200
to her time
as the New Jersey Devils' mascot.

164
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:40,200
Many of Hillary's most famous scandals
have been heavily litigated.

165
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,000
For instance: Whitewater.
More than six years of investigations

166
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,760
by 3 different prosecutors
and multiple congressional committees

167
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,640
failed to find sufficient evidence
of wrongdoing.

168
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,240
Then there was Benghazi:
eight congressional investigations

169
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,360
concluded the state department
could have done more,

170
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,640
but, none found evidence
of wrongdoing by Clinton.

171
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,400
Then there is the problematic
issue of the Swiss file transfer.

172
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,640
While investigators found Hillary was
in Zurich at the time of the transfer,

173
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,920
and documents show she was aware
the transfer took place,

174
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,080
and the Clintons
did have something to gain financially,

175
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,040
the Swiss file transfer is something
I just made up right now.

176
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,720
But the very fact that, for a second,
you kind of remembered it

177
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,680
says something about the tone
of coverage surrounding Clinton.

178
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:35,760
But many rational people are still
worried about two particular scandals:

179
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,200
it turns out nearly half of all
Americans are very concerned

180
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,000
about both her emails
and the Clinton Foundation.

181
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,080
Let's start with the emails,
which you may remember

182
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,680
from their starring role
at the RNC.

183
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,880
She put our nation's security
at extremely high risk

184
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,160
with her careless use
of a private email server.

185
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,920
Hillary Clinton cared more
about protecting her own secrets

186
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,880
than she cared
about protecting America's secrets.

187
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,720
She jeopardized the American people,

188
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,480
our national security
with her secret email server.

189
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,680
She lied !

190
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,760
Hillary's emails were basically
the unofficial theme of the RNC,

191
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,640
right alongside
"how loud can Giuliani scream ?"

192
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,840
and "Happy Days' residuals
can't buy you attention."

193
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,160
While some of Hillary's opponents feel
the scandal should put her in prison,

194
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,760
at least at the beginning,
she claimed there was nothing to see.

195
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,280
Everything I did was permitted.
There was no law or regulation.

196
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,520
There was nothing
that did not give me

197
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,680
the full authority to decide
how I was going to communicate.

198
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,920
And people across the government
knew that I used one device.

199
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,600
Maybe it was because I am not
the most technically capable person

200
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,320
and wanted to make it
as easy as possible.

201
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,800
Now it's kind of fun.

202
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,720
People get a behind-the-scenes look
at what I was emailing about,

203
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,800
and what I was communicating about.

204
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,240
That is a bad answer
for a number of reasons.

205
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,240
First she says "everything I did
was permitted", which isn't true.

206
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,320
The use of a private email server
would've required prior approval.

207
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,360
Then she blames
not being "technically capable",

208
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,880
which is an excuse for your dad when
he texts you the letter "q" 10 times,

209
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,040
but it's pretty shitty coming
from a secretary of state.

210
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,640
And then she caps it off by saying
the whole thing is "kind of fun !"

211
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,680
Which it definitely isn't.
Unless every single one of her emails

212
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,880
was just a jpeg of a dog
dressed as Dracula,

213
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,000
in which case, you know what,
that is kind of fun.

214
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,640
There have been exaggerations
on both sides.

215
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,800
While she's since acknowledged
that it was a mistake,

216
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,920
the idea persists
that it was a good deal more.

217
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,520
Let's walk through
what we actually know.

218
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,840
Hillary claims this started
due to a simple tech issue.

219
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,720
When she took office in 2009,
department-issued Blackberries

220
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,440
couldn't access
two different email accounts.

221
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,360
Clinton said it was more convenient
for her to carry one device,

222
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,200
instead of devices for work
and personal emails.

223
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,520
Looking back, it would've been better
for me to use two separate phones,

224
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,080
and two email accounts.

225
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,240
I thought using one device
would be simpler,

226
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,520
and obviously,
it hasn't worked out that way.

227
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,840
Yeah, no shit. So this situation
could potentially have been avoided

228
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,040
if she'd just had the ability
to carry two Blackberries.

229
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,920
It's the only time the best advice
a politician could have received

230
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,440
was "cargo shorts".

231
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,400
If she wanted one phone,
she had a few options:

232
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,000
first: use a state-dot-gov email
address for all her emails,

233
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,000
meaning her personal emails would
reside on government servers,

234
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,440
making them more accessible
to requests for public records.

235
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,040
Hillary sent everything through
a non-government address.

236
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,240
It's a practice that's legal,
but highly discouraged.

237
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,680
Although, she is by no means
the only one who has done that,

238
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,520
others include Colin Powell, John
Kerry, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush,

239
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,800
Rick Perry, Scott Walker,
Martin O'Malley, Greg Abbott,

240
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,080
Bobby Jindal, Sarah Palin,
Ashton Carter and Karl Rove.

241
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,520
EPA administrator Lisa Jackson
had a different workaround,

242
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,400
using a second government email
under the alias "Richard Windsor",

243
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,520
a mash up of her dog's name
and her family's hometown.

244
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,720
So she was doing government
business under her porn name.

245
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,280
Which cannot catch on.
Nobody wants to be writing

246
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,600
to Housing and Urban Development
secretary Julian Castro

247
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,600
at Bud.thunderjunk@HUD.bone,
that can't happen.

248
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,360
But Hillary went much further
than just having a private email

249
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,080
she had her own private server,
it wasn't just any old server.

250
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,680
To put an email server at your house
it's a complicated thing.

251
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,760
It was already there.
It had been there for years.

252
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,320
It is the system that my husband's
personal office used

253
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,240
when he got out of the White House
and so it was sitting in the basement.

254
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,720
Wait. You used a server
that Bill Clinton had been using,

255
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,400
which was in your basement.

256
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,720
I hate to tell you, but you
stored government records

257
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,160
on a machine that Bill called
"The Pornmaster Five Thousand".

258
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,360
I love that machine.
Old Faithful.

259
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,360
The private server wasn't
the only way Hillary communicated.

260
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,320
There was a separate government
system for classified information.

261
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,640
Some emails sent to Hillary contain
information classified in nature.

262
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,560
The FBI found 113 such emails,
though, in fairness,

263
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,240
only three of them
had classification markers

264
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,480
and were not
in the header of the email.

265
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,440
FBI found Clinton and her staff
to be extremely careless,

266
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,640
they couldn't find a case that would
support bringing criminal charges.

267
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,040
So it's not good,
but it's not as bad as it looks.

268
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,160
Which is never a satisfying
thing to hear, or, indeed,

269
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,680
read above the buffet
at a Golden Corral.

270
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:13,000
So that is basically the emails.
Let's move on to Clinton Foundation.

271
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,960
Six months ago, it was known as the
top-rated global foundation

272
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,240
that helped millions around the world
access lower-cost HIV treatment.

273
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:26,640
It has become the only charity that
inspires more visceral anger than this.

274
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,040
1-877-Kars-4-kids.

275
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,440
K-a-r-s Kars 4 Kids.

276
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,880
1-877-Kars 4 Kids.
Donate your car today !

277
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,880
Shut up !
What is this charity ?

278
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,680
You're kids !
You can't fucking drive !

279
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,160
What money-laundering
scheme are you operating ?

280
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,160
The controversy
with the Clinton Foundation

281
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,800
is not so much what
they did with their money,

282
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,760
it's the possible conflict of interest
in taking donations

283
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,280
from individuals and governments with
business before the state department.

284
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,440
In 2008, the foundation
tried to head this off

285
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,040
by promising the Obama administration
they'd not only disclose all donations,

286
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,120
but get advance approval for any
coming from foreign governments.

287
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,000
Which they did.
But, a few slipped through.

288
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,360
There's Algeria
donating half a million dollars,

289
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,200
although there's no proof that state
department policy was swayed.

290
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,080
More concerning is one involving
Russia, which does sound bad.

291
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,040
Reports out say the state
department with Clinton at the helm,

292
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,040
approved the sale of one of
US's largest uranium mines to Russia.

293
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,520
A foundation controlled
by the mine's chairman

294
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,240
was making donations
to the Clinton Foundation.

295
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:54,120
We are talking about big money.
4 donations totaling $2.35 million

296
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,440
and these donations
were not publicly disclosed.

297
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,440
Holy shit. There are so many not-good
words in that one sound bite.

298
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,920
Russia, uranium, controlled,
big money and not-disclosed.

299
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,520
It could be worse if it also
contained the words orifice,

300
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,240
shart, butt-chug and Cosby.

301
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,720
Brace yourself,
this gets pretty dense.

302
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,240
The Canadian chairman of
the mining company

303
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,240
that was sold to Russia had also given
money to the Clinton Foundation.

304
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,680
Instead of doing it directly,
he gave it through this affiliate,

305
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,800
which didn't disclose his name,
it didn't have to,

306
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,840
the affiliate wasn't included
in that agreement

307
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,880
the Foundation signed
with the Obama administration.

308
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,600
Neither the law, nor the
agreement, were technically violated,

309
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,680
though the spirit
of the agreement definitely was.

310
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,080
This looks bad, given that the state
department did sign off

311
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,520
on the sale
of that uranium mine to Russia.

312
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,320
But, not only was Hillary
not involved in that decision,

313
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,600
but eight other federal agencies,
plus the Nuclear Regulatory Commission

314
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,760
also had to sign off,
which they did.

315
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,600
So this donation was legal,
but very annoyingly handled.

316
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,840
Any suggestion of pay-for-play
fails to account

317
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,680
for the separate actions of nine
unrelated government agencies.

318
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,600
It's complicated. And like
the movie "It's Complicated",

319
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,520
it would've been best for everyone
if it had never happened,

320
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,800
but no one broke the law.

321
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,360
We've spent several frustrating
weeks trawling through

322
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,000
all the innuendo and exaggerations
surrounding her email and scandals,

323
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:37,000
they both look bad, but the harder you
look, the less you actually find.

324
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,880
There's not nothing there,

325
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,640
but what is there is irritating
rather than grossly nefarious.

326
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,640
And this is where it's instructive to
compare her to her opponent,

327
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,200
Donald Trump,
America's wealthiest hemorrhoid.

328
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,360
Because if you are struggling with
the idea of voting for Hillary

329
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,160
because of all this, you need to take
a long, hard look at Trump.

330
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,600
If you're irritated by her lying,
that is understandable,

331
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,680
but he is quantifiably worse.

332
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,120
Politifact checked around the same
number of statements from both of them

333
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,840
and found 13 percent of Hillary's
statements to be flatly false,

334
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,600
but for Trump, that figure
was a whopping 53 percent.

335
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,600
It's only that low

336
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,880
because the rest of the time
he was saying things like this.

337
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,760
If Ivanka weren't my daughter,
I'd be dating her.

338
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,880
Stop it ! It's so weird !

339
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,440
Yeah, that's probably true.
And that makes it so horrifying.

340
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,440
If you're thinking: "Hillary may
not lie as much as Trump,"

341
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,880
"but she needs to be more
transparent", that's fair enough.

342
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,120
Bear in mind, we know almost
nothing about Trump's finances.

343
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,080
And that is not good. He's the first
major-party nominee since 1980

344
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,120
not to release his tax returns
and his justification is pathetic.

345
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,400
I will give my return,
but I'm being audited now

346
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,640
for two or three years so I can't
do it until the audit is finished.

347
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,880
But yes, you can.
The IRS has explicitly said

348
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,520
you don't need to wait for a completed
audit to release them.

349
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,600
You're just saying two
completely unrelated things.

350
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,640
I'd love to pick you up
from the airport, but I can't,

351
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,120
because a blue whale's tongue
weighs as much as an elephant.

352
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,520
What are you talking about ?

353
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,880
Those two things have
nothing to do with each other !

354
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,920
On top of Trump's tax records,
there are unanswered questions

355
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,400
about his business dealings
as many experts have pointed out,

356
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,960
his investments, debts and
business ties span the globe

357
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,360
and could present unprecedented
ethical challenges for a president.

358
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,920
Traditionally, candidates
in that kind of situation promise

359
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,840
to put their financial holdings
into a blind trust,

360
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,840
where an independent trustee is
given control over their investment.

361
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,920
But when Trump was asked
if he would also do that as well,

362
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,120
he seemed
not to know what it meant.

363
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,840
Are you planning on putting
your assets in a blind trust ?

364
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,880
I have Ivanka and Eric
and Don sitting there.

365
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,680
Run the company, kids, have a good
time. I'm gonna do it for America !

366
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,120
- I would be willing to do that.
- You would put it in a blind trust ?

367
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,840
I would put it in a blind trust.
I don't know if it's a blind trust

368
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,400
if Ivanka, Don, and Eric run it,
but is that a blind trust ?

369
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,720
No, that is not a blind trust,
it's the opposite of one.

370
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,120
Almost anything else you could
have said would've been closer.

371
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,880
I'm gonna put my assets
in a doghouse filled with pudding !

372
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,920
Is that a blind trust ?
No, that's ridiculous,

373
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,760
but you're actually closer
than you were before.

374
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,800
When George Stephanopoulos
talked to Donald Trump Jr.,

375
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,280
he didn't seem to understand
what a blind trust was, either.

376
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,440
It's not a blind trust if you
are running the company.

377
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,240
We're not going to be involved
in government.

378
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,960
It's not a blind trust. You're running
the company and he's president.

379
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,600
He's not making any decisions
in the company.

380
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,520
It's not a blind trust
if it's being run by his children.

381
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,440
He'll have
nothing to do with it.

382
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,360
He's still going to know what
the businesses are.

383
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,560
We're not going to discuss it.
It doesn't matter. Trust me.

384
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,760
Wait: trust you ? The only
reasonable thing to trust you on

385
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,000
is which hair products can make
you look like a 1980s serial killer.

386
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,000
That's it.

387
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:33,000
If the financial actions
of the Clinton Foundation annoy you,

388
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,840
let me introduce you
to the Trump Foundation.

389
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,680
Not the 12 pounds of foundation
that Trump wears on his face,

390
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,200
I'm talking about
his charitable organization.

391
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,840
Washington Post has found that

392
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,120
Trump has not personally given it
any money since 2008.

393
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,560
This week, this story broke.

394
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,200
Donald Trump is facing questions
about his charitable foundation

395
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,160
after a report today
in the Washington Post.

396
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,960
The foundation spent more than
a quarter of a million dollars

397
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,360
of donated money to settle lawsuits
against Trump businesses.

398
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:15,880
Trump used foundation's money
donated by people for charity,

399
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,760
as a tool to make
some legal disputes go away.

400
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,920
And on the spectrum
of "shittiest things you can do",

401
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,160
that is right up there
with catfishing a baby owl.

402
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,960
He waited all night for you ! He's
nocturnal, so that's his day gone !

403
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,880
Trump also used foundation money to
purchase ridiculous items for himself.

404
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:44,320
Trump's foundation paid $10,000
at a charity auction in 2014

405
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,240
for a portrait painted of Trump.

406
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,200
It was the second time Trump used
foundation funds for a portrait of him.

407
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,040
Okay, wait.

408
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,240
Just for a start: what is he
doing with his face in that photo ?

409
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:03,360
That is not a smile, that's waking up
in the middle of a colonoscopy.

410
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,320
Also, on top of that,

411
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,560
how did that portrait cost
$10.000 ?

412
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,640
Looks like someone xeroxed
a black-and-white picture of Trump

413
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,960
and then painted over it
with condiments from Burger King.

414
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,520
What Trump did there
would technically be legal,

415
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,560
as long as the portrait itself was
put to some charitable purpose.

416
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,760
Univision found it,
and it wasn't exactly in an orphanage.

417
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,280
This is the painting that Trump
purchased with funds donated

418
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,280
to the charitable foundation
that carries his name.

419
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,120
Univision got the scoop that
the artwork remained

420
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,000
hanging in the restaurant
Champions Bar & Grille,

421
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,760
inside the Doral Hotel and
Golf Course, owned by Donald Trump.

422
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,520
That portrait is the perfect pairing
for his restaurant's signature dishes,

423
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,240
which are,
according to Yelp reviewers:

424
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,640
"watery tomato chunks
with no flavor"

425
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,840
and "craft beer brands
misspelled on the menu".

426
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,040
And it is not just portraits. Trump
also once used foundation funds

427
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:12,080
to buy a signed Tim Tebow helmet,
a steal at $12 000,

428
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,360
for something that contained the
head of America's worst quarterback.

429
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,360
He also used funds
to support Florida AG Pam Bondi,

430
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,840
when she was considering investigating
his not-a-university university.

431
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:31,600
So it seems the Trump Foundation may
exist primarily to benefit Trump.

432
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,680
They should really change the name
to something more appropriate,

433
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,600
like the National Association for
the Advancement of Donald Trump

434
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,720
or the NAADT for short.

435
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,440
We have barely scratched
the surface of his scandals.

436
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,560
From the ongoing lawsuits against
that bullshit university,

437
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,560
to the alleged use of undocumented
workers when building Trump Tower,

438
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,560
to the fact he received an illegal
$3,5 million loan from his father

439
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,840
in the form of a purchase of chips
from one of Trump's casinos.

440
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,800
That loan could not have been shadier
if it was given in baggies of cocaine

441
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,280
or the bones
of endangered species.

442
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,480
This campaign has been
dominated by scandals.

443
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,360
It is dangerous to think that there
is an equal number on both sides.

444
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,520
You can be irritated by some
of Hillary's. That is understandable.

445
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,360
But you should then be
fucking outraged by Trump's.

446
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,160
Try and think of it like this:

447
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,040
ethical failings in a politician
are like raisins in a cookie,

448
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,800
they shouldn't be there,
they disgust people.

449
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,800
But most politicians have
at least a few raisins.

450
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:48,760
Hillary is a cookie like this one.
She has more raisins than average.

451
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,560
There's probably
ten of those fuckers in there.

452
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,600
But we need to remember
that when it comes to Trump,

453
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,160
this is the amount of raisins
that he represents.

454
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,280
The man is a raisin monsoon.

455
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,400
He is ethically compromised
to an almost unprecedented degree.

456
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,880
So if you don't like raisins ?
I get it. They're disgusting.

457
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,160
But unfortunately, this November,
you're gonna have to swallow ten

458
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,400
or we're all going to be eating
this shit for years.

459
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,480
That is our show.
Thanks for watching.

460
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,000
We'll be back next week.
Good night !

461
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,480
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

462
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,000
END OF EPISODE 23,
SEASON III
