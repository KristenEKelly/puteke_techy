00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,880
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to Last Week Tonight. I'm John Oliver.

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,760
Thank you so much for joining us. Just
time for a quick recap of the week.

3
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,440
And we begin in South Carolina.

4
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,120
Home of ancestors that you may not want
to look up on ancestry.com.

5
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,880
South Carolina held their
republican primary last night,

6
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,360
and Donald Trump won big,
which was all the more impressive,

7
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,920
considering what had happened
earlier in the week.

8
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,000
Donald Trump is now
in a very nasty feud with the pope.

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,080
Here's what Francis had to say.
I'm quoting here.

10
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,120
A person who thinks only about
building walls wherever they may be

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,520
and not of building bridges
is not Christian.

12
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,360
Yes, this week saw a battle
between an infallible force

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,320
and an illogical object.
And it was amazing.

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,520
The most inclusive pope in recent
history questioned Trump's faith.

15
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,280
Which, I guess means the pope feels
Donald Trump is not my Christian.

16
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,480
Hashtag not my Christian.

17
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,920
And yet, Trump still won.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,920
He still won ! Although perhaps
the even bigger news last night

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,280
was what South Carolina
did to Jeb Bush.

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,240
The side of plain white rice
that nobody ordered.

21
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,400
Jeb Bush dropped out last night,
after finishing fourth.

22
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,240
Despite really pulling out all
the stops in South Carolina this week.

23
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,800
Barbara Bush appearing with son
Jeb Bush on the campaign trail.

24
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,480
Is she the closer ?

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,440
No, no. She could not be the closer.

26
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,000
You bring on the closer
when you have a lead.

27
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,160
When your campaign is where Jeb Bush's
was, you don't need a closer,

28
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,960
you need a fucking coroner.

29
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,600
And look, I can't believe I'm saying
this: but I feel bad for Jeb Bush.

30
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,640
Because not only did he bring his mom
along to help him campaign,

31
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,520
just wait until you hear
what she said about him.

32
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,560
What's left for me to say

33
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,480
is that Jeb
has been a great son, a great father,

34
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,480
great husband, married well,

35
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,360
and is one of my four favorite sons.

36
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,080
Oh, no, no.

37
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,600
I know she's joking,

38
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,920
but that is literally what you say
about your fourth favorite son.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,720
She actually went on to call him
"steady, honest, modest and kind."

40
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,560
And his campaign was over
right then and there.

41
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,640
Because you know you've lost when your
own mother is selling you to America

42
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,080
like an unappealing blind date.

43
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,840
He's steady. He's modest.
He has a pet mouse.

44
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,000
Honestly, he hasn't been with a woman
in a long time and he needs this.

45
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,920
Please. So let's move on
to the other big news here this week:

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
the Supreme Court.

47
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,320
The only thing that rules more than
a crab with a knife in its claw.

48
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,880
You rule, stabby crabby. You rule.

49
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,040
Now, as we discussed last week,
the republicans are saying

50
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,680
they won't confirm a replacement
for Antonin Scalia,

51
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,040
and spent this week refining
their explanation for why.

52
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,640
Starting within hours
of Scalia's death.

53
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,640
We have eighty years of precedent,

54
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,440
of not confirming Supreme Court
justices in election year.

55
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,440
Eighty years of not confirming Supreme
Court justices in election years.

56
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,480
The problem there, aside from the fact
that America is more than 80 years old,

57
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,880
is he is forgetting Justice Kennedy,
who was confirmed in 1988.

58
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,680
Although in his defense,
it is easy to forget that,

59
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,280
we confirmed a lot of things that year,

60
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,880
including that Rick Astley will neither
give you up nor let you down,

61
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,080
and that it's possible to produce
a crowd pleasing blockbuster

62
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,520
in which a grown woman
fucks a 13-year-old boy.

63
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,320
Oh, oh, so, I'm sorry,
he didn't look 13 ?

64
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,240
Listen to yourselves !

65
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,840
Luckily, by Monday, others were aware
of this little factual problem,

66
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,480
and they made some corrections.

67
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,520
Well, it's been more than eighty years,
I think about that long,

68
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,960
since somebody was nominated
in the president's last year.

69
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,720
So more than 80 years since someone was
"nominated" in a president's last year.

70
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,040
That does get rid of Kennedy, who was
nominated in the previous year.

71
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,400
Unfortunately, it then lets in
Fortas and Thornberry,

72
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,200
both nominated to Supreme Court
positions in 1968.

73
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,040
Which mathematically, unhelpfully,
is less than 80 years ago.

74
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,160
And when you're off by 32 years,
you're off by an entire Adam Driver !

75
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,720
Still, still neither of them wound up
being confirmed in an election year

76
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,040
which Ted Cruz undoubtedly had
in his head

77
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,840
when he took another swing
at that same argument.

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,560
For the last eighty years the senate
has not confirmed any nominee

79
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,200
nominated during an election year.

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,640
Wow, that's intricate ! For eighty
years, the senate has not confirmed

81
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,640
any nominee
nominated in an election year !

82
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,960
And that is so close to being true !

83
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,440
Unfortunately...

84
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:32,280
Unfortunately it ignores
Justice Brennan, nominated in 1956

85
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,640
and Justice Murphy,
nominated and confirmed in 1940.

86
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,120
So even by your own arbitrary
eighty-year time frame,

87
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,080
there are between one and five
exceptions to your own precedent.

88
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,760
You're basically a baker going, "Don't
worry, there are no nuts in that.

89
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,680
Except for walnuts, cashews, almonds,
peanuts and the stray pistachio.

90
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,560
Shit. I'll get my epi-pen."

91
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,400
Now, to be fair
to republican lawmakers,

92
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,480
they were under increasing pressure
not to capitulate this week,

93
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,200
when a group called
the Judicial Crisis Network

94
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,480
started releasing ads targeting them:

95
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,920
It's "We the People." Sometimes
the politicians forget that.

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,640
The Supreme Court has a vacancy,

97
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,440
and your vote in November
is your only voice.

98
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,240
This isn't about Republicans or
Democrats, it's about your voice.

99
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,880
You choose the next president, the next
president chooses the next justice.

100
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,720
No, the current president
chooses the next justice.

101
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,240
We still have a current president
that we chose.

102
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,840
And, I hate to sound like your daddy,
I hate to sound like your dad,

103
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,840
but you can't open a new president

104
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,920
when we've got a perfectly good
president already open.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,480
Finish the old president first !

106
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,280
We thought something looked a little
odd about that ad, so we checked,

107
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,120
and it turns out that
the people in it are not actual people,

108
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,000
they are stock-footage people.

109
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,000
Here is the construction worker,
whose clip is available for $199.

110
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,200
Here is "adorable
African American family portrait",

111
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,760
and here's "Asian family in front of
home, comma, portrait."

112
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,920
And if you are going to use
stock clips,

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,400
there are so many more interesting ones
out there. How about

114
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,560
this footage of a man creepily
listening to a dangerous seashell

115
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,800
or this bizarre clip of businesspeople
congratulating each other

116
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,640
while an emotionless serial killer
stares you down in the foreground,

117
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,160
or this one whose actual title is

118
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,520
"skeleton disagrees with his wife
about the issue" ?

119
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,440
That's real !
All of those clips are available !

120
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,440
And that is the problem:

121
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,160
if you use stock footage
for a "We the People" ad,

122
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,960
anyone can use those exact same people
to make the exact opposite point.

123
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,640
Please enjoy.

124
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,160
We are the American people, and we
deserve to have our voices heard.

125
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,840
Whether we are construction workers,
a generic Asian family,

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,160
a team of doctors
laughing over your cancer diagnosis,

127
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,880
an unattended baby
surrounded by pigeons,

128
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,440
or a baboon on a cell phone.

129
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,640
And the good news for us is, we had
our voices heard three years ago.

130
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,920
So now it's time to let the guy
we chose choose someone.

131
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,920
Because that's how America works.

132
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,040
So please respect the will
of the people,

133
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,920
whether we're a businessman on a swing,

134
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,160
a witch who appreciates the magic
of autumn, or again,

135
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,040
a baboon on a cellphone
who is now relaying a message.

136
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
The point is,

137
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,840
we the people want you
the politicians to do your fucking job.

138
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,560
That is a political ad. And now, this:

139
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,040
And now, Last Week Tonight asks:
how is this still a thing ?

140
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,840
This week, Hollywood Whitewashing.
How is this still a thing ?

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,480
In just one week, we'll celebrate
the Academy Awards.

142
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,960
They promise to be controversial,
as for the second year running,

143
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,160
the nominees are whiter than a yeti
in a snowstorm fighting Tilda Swinton.

144
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,880
And yet, some are arguing it's not
entirely the Academy's fault.

145
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,160
Observers say Hollywood doesn't provide
enough good roles for black actors.

146
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,480
One reason may be that even when
there are roles for non-white actors,

147
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,440
they sometimes still get played by
white people.

148
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,360
In Prince of Persia, based on
a video game set in ancient Iran,

149
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,600
Jake Gyllenhaal plays
the title character.

150
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,960
That's right. Jake Gyllenhaal, a white
American with a Swedish last name,

151
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,320
was cast to play the Prince of Persia.

152
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,360
From, you know, Persia.
And he's far from alone.

153
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,000
Just last year, Emma Stone played
the half-Asian Allison Ng in Aloha.

154
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,400
Ho Ola Lea.

155
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,360
Apparently "Aloha" means hello, goodbye
and you've got to be kidding me.

156
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,680
When Hollywood needed actors to play
Egyptians in Exodus: Gods and Kings,

157
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,200
it knew just what to do.

158
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,120
Moses, Ramses, you grew up together
close as brothers.

159
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,960
That was a guy from Australia
and a guy from Britain

160
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,240
pretending to be two guys from Egypt,
a country in Africa.

161
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,000
And if you like that, don't miss
Gods of Egypt opening Friday,

162
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,840
starring a Scottish guy.

163
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,920
I shall be your one true God.

164
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,320
That's the whitest Egyptian
since these four.

165
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,640
All of this is nothing new,
white actors have taken roles

166
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,800
designed for every ethnicity
throughout Hollywood history,

167
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,320
from John Wayne as Genghis Khan
in The Conqueror.

168
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,520
Your treacherous head is not safe
on your shoulders.

169
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,720
To the non Puerto Rican Natalie Wood
as Maria in West Side Story.

170
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,880
Buenas noches.

171
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,240
To the multiple instances of white
actors playing Asian characters

172
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,880
from Marlon Brando...

173
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,120
Sakini by name,
interpreter by profession.

174
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,560
...to, of course, this.

175
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,400
You cannot go on
keep ringin' my bell !

176
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,320
It's a performance the New York Times
in 1961 praised as "broadly exotic."

177
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,560
Seriously.

178
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,000
There's no shortage of roles for white
actors playing non-white characters.

179
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,560
The historical figure you're playing
wasn't white ? Not a problem.

180
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,400
The contemporary figure you're playing
wasn't white ? Not a problem.

181
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,440
The cartoon the movie was based on
was entirely about non-white people ?

182
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,920
Not a problem.

183
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,000
Your characters are named
Esteban and Clara Trueba

184
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,840
in the Isabel Allende novel
the movie is based on ?

185
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,240
Right this way
Jeremy Irons and Meryl Streep.

186
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,200
And even when a non-white person
does score a major roll,

187
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,600
when they make the porn parody,
guess what happens ?

188
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,840
- Don't worry, I got this one.
- No Glenn. Put your dick away.

189
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,600
And when filmmakers get called out
on white washing,

190
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,120
the justification has less to do
with black and white

191
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,920
and more to do with Green.

192
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,360
Director Ridley Scott told
Variety Magazine

193
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,880
he can't mount a $140 million film

194
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,400
and say that my lead actor is Mohammad
so and so from such and such.

195
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,080
Yeah, you needed the white-hot star
power of whoever the fuck this guy is.

196
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,600
And maybe all of this would be
less egregious

197
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,720
if anytime an actor of color took on
a traditionally white role,

198
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,120
half the country didn't go ape shit.

199
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,800
The appearance of a black storm trooper
in the first trailer

200
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,600
for Star Wars: The Force Awakens

201
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,960
is causing a lot of chatter on social
media, even some racist comments.

202
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,200
Several people were apparently upset

203
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,040
that the actress playing
the character is African American.

204
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,720
He'd be the first black Bond.

205
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,440
The author of those Bond novels saying
Elba is too, quote, street.

206
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,720
Yes, if you're black,

207
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,400
even if you're an actor who sometimes
dresses like French Waldo,

208
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,200
people will still say
you're too street.

209
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,160
And this isn't even getting into
how movies about minorities

210
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,480
will still put white people
in the foreground.

211
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,360
How are we supposed to believe
Tom Cruise is the last samurai ?

212
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,640
This guy is the last samurai ?
This guy ?

213
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,120
This guy is the last samurai ?

214
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,720
This guy ?
This guy is the last samurai ?

215
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,880
Fuck you.

216
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,920
So when you hear people say the Oscars
are so white

217
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,400
because the roles aren't there,
just remember

218
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,240
the Academy gave Oscars for characters
Olan, Billy Kwon, and Louise Molina

219
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,880
to actors named
Louise, Linda and William.

220
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,120
All of which is enough to make you ask,

221
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,200
Hollywood whitewashing,
how is this still a thing ?

222
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,160
Moving on.

223
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,200
Our main story tonight
concerns breast implants.

224
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,520
Some are against them. Others believe
they're fine in rare cases.

225
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,800
And many believe you should be able to
get them whenever the fuck you want.

226
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,240
Sorry, did I say breast implants ?
I meant abortions.

227
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,160
Tonight's main topic concerns
abortions.

228
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,800
And before you change the channel,
before you change the channel,

229
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,440
I know this is a polarizing topic.
Although interestingly,

230
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,600
when the website Vox asked people
in the street for their opinions,

231
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,400
the issue wasn't quite as binary
as it's usually presented.

232
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,720
If I had to pick,
I would say that I'm pro-choice.

233
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,880
But personally I'm more on a...
somewhere in the middle.

234
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,240
I wouldn't. But I can't choose
for other people.

235
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,080
What do you call it ? Pro-life.

236
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,400
I think when a baby gets a heartbeat,
that should be the cutoff point.

237
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,720
That's just my stance.

238
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,480
I'm not the kind of guy, like,
I want everyone to follow my stance.

239
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,240
Not needing anyone
to follow your stance

240
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,520
is a healthy attitude to abortion,

241
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,480
and it's also a terrible attitude
with which to lead the Rockettes.

242
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,960
You do you, Bethany ! You do you, girl.

243
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,880
You do you.

244
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,320
The truth is, people's opinions on
abortion make up a spectrum.

245
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,960
But most of us believe it should be
legal in at least a few circumstances.

246
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,880
In fact, only 19 percent of Americans
told Gallup

247
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,240
they thought it should be completely
illegal.

248
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,360
And if you are in that 19 percent,

249
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,880
you are frankly excused
from watching the rest of this.

250
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,880
But do rejoin us at 11:29, because
once I'm done talking about this,

251
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,200
we'll all be watching a video
featuring a bucket of sloths.

252
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,760
And I promise you, it is almost
violently delightful.

253
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,160
But, until that time, the rest of us
do need to talk about abortion laws.

254
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,600
Because wherever you are
on this spectrum,

255
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,360
whether you, like me, believe that
women should have the right to choose,

256
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,920
or whether you believe abortion should
only be allowed in a few circumstances

257
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,040
then this story should concern you.

258
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,840
And here is why: since 2010,

259
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,120
new state laws have contributed to the
closure of about 70 abortion clinics.

260
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,880
And these four states are down to
exactly one abortion clinic each.

261
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,720
That's right: Mississippi now has four
times as many "s's"

262
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,120
as it has abortion clinics.

263
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,920
And if you're thinking, "how is that
possible ?" It's in no small part

264
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,800
because the key Supreme Court decision
concerning abortion

265
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,240
is no longer Roe vs. Wade,

266
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,880
it's the 1992 Planned Parenthood
vs. Casey ruling that said

267
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,800
states can create restrictions,
as long as they don't place

268
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,640
"an undue burden
that places a substantial obstacle

269
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,120
in the path of a woman
seeking an abortion."

270
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,720
Meaning women can be asked to jump
through a few hoops,

271
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,080
just not too many. Which might sound
a little less insulting

272
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,440
if those weren't also the rules
for a dog agility course.

273
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,800
And the vagueness of that ruling has
allowed states to introduce dozens

274
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,800
of what some have called
TRAP laws,

275
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,840
or targeted
regulation of abortion providers.

276
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,400
Though their supporters,
to an eerie degree,

277
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,960
all characterize them
somewhat differently.

278
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,680
This is really about the issue of
women's health.

279
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,080
We're protecting women's health
and safety.

280
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,000
We are protecting women's health.

281
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,600
I just wanted to reiterate
that this is really all about

282
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,200
protecting the health
and safety of women.

283
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,520
Yeah, but when you're that insistent
about women's health,

284
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,040
it starts to sound suspicious.

285
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,480
It's like having a folder on your
computer called "definitely not porn."

286
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,440
You're not fooling anyone,

287
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,280
you're asking more questions
than you're answering.

288
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,080
So let's take a look at what these laws
actually do for women's health.

289
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,440
Starting with Texas's HB-2,

290
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,160
which passed in 2013
and had two key stipulations.

291
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,560
It requires abortion clinics to meet
the same building standards

292
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,400
as outpatient surgical centers

293
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,000
and requires their doctors
to have hospital admitting privileges.

294
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,400
Hospital admitting privileges and
high building standards sound great.

295
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,160
Until you realize
what they actually mean.

296
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,400
Sort of how "Moondance" sounds like
a lovely night of romance and whimsy,

297
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,320
but really means
"having sex with Van Morrison."

298
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,840
And that's not what you signed up for.

299
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,200
Because the outpatient surgical center
requirement

300
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,120
can be difficult to fulfill,
as this Texas clinic discovered.

301
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,760
Explain why it's gonna be shut down,
because this isn't wide enough.

302
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,040
Yeah, the walls that we have,
they're about three feet wide.

303
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,040
And to be an ASC,
it has to be eight feet wide.

304
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,200
Now I'm not saying
width isn't important.

305
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,360
In fact, in some circumstances it's
"far" more important than length...

306
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,400
is a thing that I have heard.

307
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,280
Penises. I'm talking about penises.

308
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,120
But that eight-foot requirement
is wide enough

309
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,320
for two surgical gurneys
to pass one another in a corridor,

310
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,800
which is not something that is likely
to happen at a small abortion clinic.

311
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,320
About 90% of abortions occur
in the first trimester,

312
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,080
when they are non-surgical, with
no cutting, and only mild sedation.

313
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,680
They usually involve suction,
or just taking medication,

314
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,400
neither of which require
a large surgical facility.

315
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,720
You don't need an operating room
to take a pill.

316
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Which is a good thing. You wouldn't
want an entire surgical team

317
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,360
scrubbing in
every time Larry King needed a boner.

318
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,560
They'll get tired.

319
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,200
And as for Texas's law that doctors
have admitting privileges

320
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,120
at a local hospital, a requirement
ten other states have also passed,

321
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,080
that can shut a clinic down.

322
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,920
Because many hospitals,
for financial or political reasons,

323
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,200
won't grant them to a doctor
who performs abortions.

324
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,280
And, again: defenders of these laws
will say they have a simple purpose.

325
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,520
By requiring that abortionists obtain
admitting privileges

326
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,840
at local hospitals,
we are protecting women's health.

327
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,480
Yeah, but are you, though ?
Because it's worth noting,

328
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,920
both the AMA and the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists

329
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,080
have argued
there is simply no medical basis

330
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,080
for requiring local admitting
privileges.

331
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,720
Which does make sense,
because hospitals will see anyone.

332
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,840
They'll see you if you've gotten an
Elmo Pez dispenser stuck in your butt.

333
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,480
They'll have questions for you,
but they will see you.

334
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:28,080
They'll see you, they'll question you,
and, later, they may laugh at you.

335
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,560
And, while we are on the subject
of safety:

336
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,680
legal abortions have a mortality rate
of 0.00073 percent.

337
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,520
That is nearly ten times less
than what one study found

338
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,720
was the risk for dying
as the result of a colonoscopy.

339
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,360
And let's agree, by the way, all of us:

340
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,520
death by colonoscopy has to be
one of the worst ways to die.

341
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,240
Right after having your mother
catch you masturbating

342
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,640
and, while you're trying to pull your
pants up, you fall and hit your head

343
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,600
so your dad has to carry you pants-less
to the car to take you to the hospital,

344
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,560
and the girl next door you have
a crush on tries to help

345
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,560
but she's laughing so hard
at the size of your penis

346
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,800
that she closes the door on your hand,
startling your mother,

347
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,840
who slams her foot on the gas, dragging
you behind the car for several blocks

348
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,720
while your father yells
"Your T.V. show is derivative

349
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,080
and you'll never escape the shadow
of Jon Stewart."

350
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,160
That's what we're all, that's what
we're all afraid of, right ?

351
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,800
That's all, we're all pretty afraid,
that's a general fear.

352
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:27,080
And look, if admitting privileges are
so important for continuity of care,

353
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,240
it is weird that you don't need them
in Texas to run a birthing center,

354
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,320
even though one study found 12 percent
of women admitted to birthing centers

355
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,520
wound up being transferred
to a hospital.

356
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,520
Texas will shut down an abortion clinic
for having walls too close together,

357
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,200
but if you want to give birth in a tub
surrounded by mood lighting, potpourri,

358
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,920
and the music of Bon Iver,

359
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,080
no one will say anything other than
"just take it down a notch."

360
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,720
And proponents of these laws will point
to a few notorious cases,

361
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,400
like the clinic run by Kermit Gosnell
in Pennsylvania,

362
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,760
who wound up being convicted of murder.

363
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,920
Although for the record, his clinic had
not been inspected for seventeen years,

364
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,040
which it absolutely should have been.
They didn't need new laws

365
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,520
so much as they needed to bother
to enforce the ones they had.

366
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,440
Putting absurd new restrictions on all
clinics because of Kermit Gosnell

367
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,160
is like seeing that photo of
a Taco Bell employee licking the food

368
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,440
and saying, "All restaurants have to
have corridors that are 8 feet wide."

369
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,440
Hold on, that's going to shut down
most of the restaurants in the country,

370
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,080
and you've done nothing to address
the root problem here.

371
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,360
And some of these laws have nothing
whatsoever to do with clinic safety,

372
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,280
like the ones that force doctors like
Willie Parker to spread misinformation.

373
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,200
The state requires me to cover some
very basic information with you.

374
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,240
First, the state requires me to tell
you that if you're having an abortion,

375
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,240
there's the possibility
to having complications.

376
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,920
There's a risk of bleeding,
there's a risk of infection,

377
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,080
there's a risk of damage
to any of your organs.

378
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,840
But guess what ?
Those are all the exact same risks

379
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,400
from continuing a pregnancy
and going to term.

380
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,680
The final thing that I have to tell you
that I don't agree with

381
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,880
but I have to tell you anyway,

382
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,880
having an abortion can increase
your risk for breast cancer.

383
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,600
There is not a shred of scientific
evidence to prove that.

384
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,560
They can require me to tell you
the first part,

385
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,120
but they can't stop me from giving you
my best medical opinion and that is

386
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,760
that there's no increased risk for
breast cancer from an abortion.

387
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,320
It must be so weird,
it must be...

388
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,800
it must be weird for a woman to witness
her medical professional

389
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,800
forced to play a game of
"good doctor/bad doctor."

390
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,480
"Okay, time for your tetanus booster."
"Noooo ! Those cause autism !"

391
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,800
"Well, there's not a shred of
scientific evidence to prove that !

392
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,120
Bad doctor ! Bad, bad doctor !"

393
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,080
In addition, some states have passed
laws requiring providers

394
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,000
to show and describe
an ultrasound image,

395
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,560
whether a woman
wants to see that or not.

396
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,200
And when North Carolina was defending
such a law,

397
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,880
this was how they attempted
to soften that.

398
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,000
The proposed law says if a woman wishes
not to see the ultrasound

399
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,720
or hear the fetal heartbeat,

400
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,880
she may cover her ears and eyes
and refuse to listen.

401
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,920
Oh, great. So North Carolina tried to
give women viewing ultrasounds

402
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,040
the same option as women trying to
watch John Travolta's performance

403
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,880
in the new OJ Simpson show.

404
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,280
Oh my god !
Oh my god, what is he doing !?

405
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,520
Does he think Robert Shapiro was a sad
clown in a Baz Luhrmann movie ?

406
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,560
I didn't want to watch this !
Why are you making me ?

407
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,800
And some other clinics
enter into a bureaucratic war

408
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,800
as a result of these laws.
Take this clinic in Alabama.

409
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,760
It was shut down after not being able
to meet the new building codes

410
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,280
Alabama had forced upon it.

411
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,080
But instead of giving up, the owner
cashed in his retirement savings

412
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,600
to open a new facility that complied
completely with the law.

413
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,720
And that is when
Alabama started targeting him directly.

414
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,160
I've spent close to a million dollars

415
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,720
to meet all of their requirements.

416
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,560
And you think you're done,
and what are they trying to do ?

417
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,760
They try to pass another bill that said
I can't be in 2,000 feet of a school.

418
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,040
They're treating me,

419
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,320
the patients,
the physicians

420
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,720
as sex offenders.

421
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,720
They're treating someone like a sex
offender when he clearly isn't one

422
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,360
it's a move that's now commonly known
as a "reverse-Cosby".

423
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,360
And look, if you are thinking,

424
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,440
"But John, when a clinic closes,
can't women just travel further ?"

425
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,680
You should know: there are now
mandatory waiting periods in 27 states

426
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,080
some up to seventy two hours between
an initial consult and an abortion.

427
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,640
So women can be forced to either
take multiple trips,

428
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,200
or plan the shittiest three-day weekend
imaginable.

429
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,520
And if that's not possible, they can
end up making desperate decisions.

430
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,080
Listen to one clinic administrator
describe a call from a patient.

431
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,840
I told her, you can come to
San Antonio, we can help you here.

432
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,520
And she said I can't,
I don't have the means,

433
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,400
there is no way I can get to
San Antonio.

434
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,920
So, what if I tell you what I have
in my kitchen cabinet

435
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,560
and you tell me what I can do ?

436
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,680
"I'll tell you what I have in my
kitchen, you tell me what I can do."

437
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,440
When your state's abortion laws
are forcing people

438
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,560
into the most depressing quick-fire
challenge in Top Chef history,

439
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,320
I think it's safe to say
they've gone too fucking far.

440
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,600
Because here is the thing: abortion
cannot just be theoretically legal.

441
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,800
It has to be literally accessible.

442
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,320
And remember, every single one
of us watching this right now,

443
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,840
every single one of us
watching right now agrees

444
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:51,240
that it should be legal at the very
least in a few extreme circumstances.

445
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,480
Say, hypothetically, a young girl has
been the victim of sexual assault.

446
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,680
Well, thanks to these laws,

447
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,880
this hypothetical girl might have to
travel a long distance,

448
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,800
because there were no clinics
close to her.

449
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,560
The girl might be approaching the point

450
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,560
where her state won't let her
get the procedure at all.

451
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,520
Well, sadly, none of that is
hypothetical.

452
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,640
And I'll let a Texas clinic director
tell you the rest.

453
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,160
In order to see her I need to put her
to sleep. I need a nurse anesthetist.

454
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,560
Because of this law, it's impossible
to find people to work for us.

455
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,200
She's thirteen years old
and she is a victim of rape

456
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,920
and she drove four hours
from McAllen to San Antonio

457
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,160
and we had to turn her away.

458
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,320
And there was nothing I could do
to save her.

459
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,600
And so now if she has the procedure,

460
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
and that if is huge,

461
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,680
she'll have to go all the way
to New Mexico

462
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,880
and pay $5,000. And get there.

463
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,280
And spend three days.

464
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,560
It'll never happen.
We know it won't.

465
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,640
And at that point, we have sentenced
a child to motherhood.

466
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,440
Now, that specific provider,
Whole Woman's Health,

467
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,320
is at the center of a Supreme Court
case that will be heard next month.

468
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,640
If it's a 4-4 tie,
the Texas laws stand.

469
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,960
So the best hope is
that Justice Kennedy,

470
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,480
seen here in dog form,
straightening his tie,

471
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,760
will see Texas's regulation
as an "undue burden".

472
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,640
This whole situation is basically
in his paws now.

473
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,200
Meanwhile, Florida is drafting
similar TRAP laws,

474
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,480
and the law in Alabama that would close
that one clinic near a school

475
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,440
will be introduced to committee
later this week.

476
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,680
And if all this has made you sad,
or angry,

477
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,920
then you should really keep an eye
on these laws.

478
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,240
And if you don't have a problem
with the current situation, then,

479
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,920
well, it is 11:29 ! Welcome back !
Thanks for rejoining us, 19 percent.

480
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,120
Quick question:
what the fuck is wrong with you ?!

481
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,160
But no, no, no, you know what ?
Putting that aside.

482
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,520
I did promise, I made a promise.

483
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,840
I promised everyone sloths in a bucket.
And that is what you are going to see.

484
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,600
Although if you are in that 19 percent,

485
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,400
I'm going to have to insist that
you cover your ears and eyes

486
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,400
and refuse to listen.

487
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,880
For everyone else, it is sloth o'clock:

488
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,000
You are very welcome.
Now, look, I know...

489
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,920
I know this story

490
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,640
has not been the ideal way for anyone
to go to sleep on a Sunday night.

491
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,200
But we thought that this was something
you should really know about.

492
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,640
And the only way that
I can make it right

493
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,240
is to give you the absolutely ideal
way to go to sleep:

494
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,520
an actual sloth in a nightcap.

495
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,240
Here she is !

496
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,200
Thank you so much for
watching the show ! Good night !
