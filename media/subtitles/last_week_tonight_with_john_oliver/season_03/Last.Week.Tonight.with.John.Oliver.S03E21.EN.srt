00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,320
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,880
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight" !

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,160
I'm John Oliver,
thank you so much for joining us.

4
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,520
And let us begin tonight
with the 2016 election.

5
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,160
Or as you may know it,

6
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,760
The Lady Liberty Convenience Store
Robbery Gone Wrong

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,400
Descending Into a Hostage Situation,
Now She's Demanding a Chopper 2016.

8
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,160
The two candidates
have had a busy week.

9
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,240
First Hillary Clinton.
Can we talk about that new hairdo ?

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,960
No. No. We never, ever can.

11
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,840
She released her tax returns this week
and had to navigate the fallout from

12
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,360
the release
of State Department emails.

13
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,640
And yet, as it's always the case,

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,880
she was eclipsed by the imploding star
that is Donald Trump.

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,360
The owner of what you might describe
as resting rich face.

16
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,440
This was the 53rd consecutive win.

17
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,720
He was going to put his campaign
back on track

18
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,760
and on Monday he gave a big speech

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,640
to outline actual details
in his tax policy.

20
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,480
I am proposing an across-the-border
income tax reduction,

21
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,160
especially for middle-income Americans.

22
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,440
This will lead to millions
of new and really good paying jobs.

23
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,480
If you're thinking

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,840
"That's the most boring
Donald Trump speech I've ever seen",

25
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,280
that might be because he was reading
that script off a teleprompter,

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,520
not talking off the top of his head.

27
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,000
It's like watching
a circus seal fold laundry.

28
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,680
That's not the thing you normally do,

29
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,360
but I can't wait until you get back
to doing the fun stuff.

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,120
But to be fair,
his campaign must've been pleased

31
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,000
to keep him disciplined and on message
for an entire hour.

32
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,920
Unfortunately, the rest of the week
quickly devolved,

33
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,320
because the very next day
he made a chilling suggestion

34
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,480
that second amendment people
could stop Hillary Clinton.

35
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,360
And before people could even
get over that, he moved on to this.

36
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,600
ISIS is honoring president Obama.

37
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,440
He is the founder of ISIS.
He is the founder of ISIS.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,240
And I would say the co-founder
would be crooked Hillary Clinton.

39
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,160
I tell you what,
I will give Trump this.

40
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,840
At least he made sure
to include Hillary as co-founder,

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,760
hashtag "Feminism",
hashtag "ISIS with her."

42
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,440
Now clearly what he just said
is absolutely absurd.

43
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,200
But even when people tried
to help him reframe it,

44
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,000
he doubled down.

45
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,240
Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt
pressed him on that.

46
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,320
You meant that he created the vacuum,
he lost the peace...

47
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,360
No, I meant he's the founder of ISIS.

48
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,680
But he's not sympathetic to them.
He hates them.

49
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,680
I don't care, he was the founder.

50
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,000
He's so insistent.
He's like a guy drowning,

51
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,560
but waving off a lifeboat saying,

52
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,800
"Get out of her,  I'm very buoyant,
I'm the most buoyant."

53
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,840
"Everybody talks about my buoyancy,
I'm a tremendous floater."

54
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,320
Trump was forced to walk
his ISIS remarks back on Friday,

55
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,640
tweeting "Ratings challenged
CNN report so seriously"

56
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,600
"that I call President Obama
and Clinton the founder of ISIS."

57
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,400
And then in all caps,
"THEY DON'T GET SARCASM ?"

58
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,920
And yes, sarcasm is a bullshit excuse,
it's the douchebag's apology.

59
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,840
But at least he diffused the situation,
which is what made so much weirder

60
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,720
when later that same day
he walked his walk back, back.

61
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,400
So I said "the founder of ISIS",
obviously I'm being sarcastic.

62
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,200
Then... But not that sarcastic,
to be honest with you.

63
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,360
What are you doing ?
What are you doing ?

64
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,040
You know that riddle
where there are two people,

65
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,040
one who always lies
and one who always tells the truth ?

66
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,760
Donald Trump is both of those at once.

67
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,960
And he had barely put
that hot mess behind him when,

68
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,360
in Pennsylvania, he started up
a whole new controversy.

69
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,080
The only way we can lose,
in my opinion,

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,920
I really mean this, Pennsylvania,
is if cheating goes on.

71
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,840
The only way the can beat it,
in my opinion,

72
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,320
and I mean this one hundred percent,

73
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,200
if in certain sections of the state
they cheat.

74
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,520
Okay, he means it one hundred percent,

75
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,400
so by the time this show airs,
he'll presumably have said

76
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,760
he was kidding, but not,
but yes, but maybe,

77
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,760
but not, but yes, but maybe.

78
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,320
But what is really worth
taking noticed of there

79
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,520
is that he's suggesting

80
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,320
the election may be stolen
by his opponent.

81
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,800
And that's actually dangerous.
He is priming his supporters

82
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,960
to question the result
when he loses Pennsylvania,

83
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,640
as all republican presidential
candidates have since 1988.

84
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,040
And he's not just
talking the talk here,

85
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,640
he's asking his supporters
to walk the walk.

86
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,000
His website now has an application
that you can fill out

87
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,840
to be a Trump election day observer.

88
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,320
In a way, we are all
Trump election day observers.

89
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,760
Because if you look out of your window
in November

90
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,440
and see four horsemen
of the Apocalypse,

91
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,320
you'll know
"Oh shit, they've just called Florida."

92
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,600
But it does seem he actually wants
people to participate.

93
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,120
If you go to his website,
which you absolutely should not,

94
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,320
and try to sign up,
you'll be asked to donate,

95
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,000
which, again,
you absolutely should not do.

96
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,640
Anyone who wants to give their money
to a Manhattan narcissist

97
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,200
whose interest begin and end
with the plight of white people

98
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,120
should keep in mind

99
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,120
that Woody Allen's "CafÃ© Society"
is getting decent reviews right now.

100
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,920
Not great, but decent,
it's one of the fine ones.

101
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,920
We wanted to see
what actually signing up involved,

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,120
so we signed up without donating and
received an email from the campaign

103
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,120
saying "We are going to do everything
we are legally allowed to do"

104
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,000
"to stop crooked Hillary
from rigging this election."

105
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,600
Which is troubling,
'cause I'm not sure Donald Trump

106
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,880
what he's legally allowed to do.

107
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,560
His own attorney once had to apologize

108
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,680
for saying
"You cannot rape your own spouse."

109
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,680
And honestly, I'm surprised
Trump even had an attorney,

110
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,440
I've always presumed he got legal
advice from a John Grisham paperback

111
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,560
purchased
at a white supremacist yard sale.

112
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,880
Remember, this week was supposed
to be all about his economic plan.

113
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,680
To be fair, he did try to get back onto
a focused economic message on Friday,

114
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,080
it's just by that point,
the prompters were gone

115
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,520
and he was back to doing
what he does best.

116
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,320
I love these boards.
Look, here's a beauty.

117
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,840
I love charts, I love them.

118
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,880
And I always say it's too tough
to put the screen up,

119
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,680
you gotta get guys, it cost
too much money... I don't like it.

120
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,520
This is a cheap version of a screen,
okay, just as good.

121
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,400
But you need good, strong hands.

122
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,560
So look... ready ? Here it is.

123
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,040
That is just... magnificent.

124
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,160
Just a recap: he picks up a chart
and says "Here's a beauty",

125
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,440
he then utters when a straight face
the sentence "I love charts",

126
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,440
before unconvincingly claming

127
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,920
that only someone with big,
strong hands can hold a chart up.

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,120
And then he turns the chart
back to him

129
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,680
as he's clearly forgotten
whatever the fuck is printed on it.

130
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,240
Look, I cannot wait
for this campaign to be over,

131
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,080
but part of me
is going to miss him when he's gone.

132
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,880
So let's move on for now
to the Olympics,

133
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,800
the only time trampolining
is considered a sport

134
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,600
rather than the most effective way
of breaking a nine year old's arm.

135
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,880
The Olympics has featured
stirring performances all week,

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,480
but perhaps the boldest thing I saw
occurred during a commercial break,

137
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,920
with an ad for API,
the American Petroleum Institute.

138
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,320
They are paying for ads during
the Olympics in certain markets

139
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,360
and there's something
a little familiar about them.

140
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,240
Who opposes harmful fuel mandates ?

141
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,800
Producers and restaurants,
tailors and car owners,

142
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,800
and who will pay more at the pump
and the grocery store ? You.

143
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,560
Tell Congress you agree

144
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,280
to fix the harmful
renewable fuel standard.

145
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,760
If you're still not quite seeing it,
perhaps this will help.

146
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,600
You took our shit, API !
You took our shit !

147
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,360
Everything from the font
to the design style.

148
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,000
You have so thoroughly copied
our credits, by the end of that ad,

149
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,000
I was honestly worried
I was about to watch 29 minutes

150
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,000
of a rat-faced Englishman
telling me sad news facts.

151
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,880
Now, ordinarily I would be furious,
but by the look of API's other ads,

152
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,280
they need all the help they can get.

153
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,920
We opened this place
to serve fresh food.

154
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,800
Sell things
like preserves and local produce

155
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,480
and offer folks
a great place to catch up.

156
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,440
These days,
a lot of that talk is about fracking.

157
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,880
Bull shit ! I will bet
the conversations in that shop are

158
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,280
solely about candle making and the year
you spent in prison for insider trading

159
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,400
'cause you all seem to be characters
in a Martha Stewart fever dream.

160
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,440
But somehow even stupider
than the coffee shop ad

161
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,040
is my favorite API commercial,
featuring Rebecca and Andy.

162
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,520
- Energy, environment...
- Some say it's "either or."

163
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,880
I don't buy it.

164
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,280
- We can produce more energy...
- And protect the environment.

165
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,600
- There's been a lot of progress.
- Put politics aside.

166
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,800
- Work together...
- And there's a lot more we can do.

167
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,320
- I'm Rebecca.
- I'm Andy.

168
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,480
Join us and become an energy voter.

169
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,280
Cool !

170
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,120
There's nothing millennials like more
than bros in hoodies

171
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,480
spitting some real talk
on behalf of the petroleum lobby.

172
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,360
If API is going to steal our branding,

173
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,400
they are leaving us with no choice
but to steal theirs.

174
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,400
So please enjoy
the new opening credits of this show

175
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,240
that we are trying out.

176
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,160
- I'm Rebecca.
- I'm Andy.

177
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,720
- We're young and cool.
- I'm wearing a hoodie.

178
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,640
- Andy is wearing a hoodie.
- I use and enjoy Snapchat.

179
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,680
And I think Instagram
is hashtag on fleek.

180
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,200
And you're about to watch
Last Week Tonight.

181
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,480
- But before you do...
- We just wanted to tell you...

182
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,280
The American Petroleum Institute
is the fucking worst.

183
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,040
- The worst.
- Fuck them !

184
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,320
Hey Rebecca, did you know the API
spent decades and million of dollars

185
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,840
supporting deniers
of man-made climate change ?

186
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,560
I did. Did you know they had
research warning them

187
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,680
about a link between fossil fuels
and climate change as early as 1968 ?

188
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,840
Maybe that's why their logo looks like

189
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,520
is being impaled
by a polar bear's dick.

190
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,320
Anyway,
enjoy the Last Week Tonight show.

191
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,400
- I'm Rebecca.
- I'm Andy.

192
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,440
Go fuck yourself, API !

193
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,000
Moving on... Our main story tonight
concerns cars.

194
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,320
The muse for America's greatest songs,

195
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,520
from the complete works
of Bruce Springsteen

196
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,480
to Tim McGraw's
ode to the American truck.

197
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,600
If you like it out loud
And you're hillbilly proud,

198
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,440
Then you know what I'm talking about,
Let me hear you say, Truck yeah !

199
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,000
Truck yeah !

200
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,080
That song is un-trucking-believable.

201
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,440
Sure, it doesn't make sense that
they're driving around in an empty lot

202
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,960
but it looks like they're having fun,
so gives a flying truck ?

203
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,840
But America's auto-obsession
isn't just a hobby.

204
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,920
86% of American workers
get to work by automobile.

205
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,400
The remaining 14% commute
by public transportation, walking

206
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,880
or in the case of that one weird guy
in your office named Nathaniel,

207
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,640
penny-farthing bicycle.

208
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,120
Get down from there.... Stop it !

209
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,000
And if you don't have a car,

210
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,840
holding down a job
can be a tremendous challenge.

211
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,600
Just watch one woman describe
her commute via public transportation.

212
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,800
I normally get the kids out
on their bus on time,

213
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,440
it's just a matter of whether or not
I make my bus.

214
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,360
This is the first bus,

215
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,800
and then I take two trains
and another bus.

216
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,200
Normally, it takes me roughly
an hour and a half to two hours.

217
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,440
If I were to drive to work, it takes
me maybe ten or fifteen minutes.

218
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,880
Her commute would be ten minutes with
a car. Without one, she is literally

219
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,640
the length of the movie
The Imitation Game away from her job.

220
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,840
Which is to say, two wasted hours
that feel like forever.

221
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,080
But, but cars are obviously expensive.

222
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,280
Which is why many people have
to take out loans to buy them.

223
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,480
Some, from places like this.

224
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,920
Everyone is approved
at Viers Auto Sales

225
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,600
regardless of your credit.

226
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,840
Even if this is my trade in ?

227
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,480
Approved.

228
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,560
- Even if I'm self-employed ?
- Approved.

229
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,880
Even if we have two repossessions,
a foreclosure and a bankruptcy ?

230
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,880
Everyone is approved !

231
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,040
Okay, listen:
I do not mean to be judgey here,

232
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,240
but don't approve the clown.
He's a clown.

233
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,800
Genetically speaking,
he is programmed for murder.

234
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,360
Now, that ad is targeting people
with bad credit,

235
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,640
who are only eligible for what
are called subprime loans.

236
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,800
And nearly a quarter of all car loans

237
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,680
are now of the high-risk,
subprime variety.

238
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,440
So many are being issued they've
recently reached a 10-year high.

239
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,320
And if the phrase,
"a boom in sub-prime loans"

240
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,080
is making your eye twitch with
flashbacks to the mortgage crisis,

241
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,280
just wait, we will get there.

242
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,600
But first, let me take you on a tour
of the subprime auto loan industry.

243
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,880
And we'll start with so-called
"buy here, pay here" dealers,

244
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,920
who do their own lending.
They've been around for years,

245
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,280
and their ads
make it all look very simple.

246
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,040
How can we get you financed
when others can't ?

247
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,160
Two reasons: first, we are the bank.

248
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,080
We don't have to send you
or your deal anywhere.

249
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,360
The second reason
we can get you financed

250
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,200
is because we don't even look
at your credit score.

251
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,960
"Of course ! In fact, we don't even
know what a credit score is !"

252
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,680
"What is a good one ? PG-13 ?
640 on the verbal, 710 on math ?"

253
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,280
"Three under par ?
Is that a good credit score ?"

254
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,000
"We've got no idea
and that's why you should trust us."

255
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,760
And look: theoretically, theoretically
it is a good thing

256
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,560
that car dealers lend money to people
who can't get financing elsewhere.

257
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,120
But in practice, these dealerships
can trap people  with few options

258
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,920
into paying
vastly more than a car is worth.

259
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,800
It's just one of the many ways

260
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,880
in which, when you are poor,
everything can be more expensive.

261
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,360
The average interest rate at
a "buy here, pay here" lot is 19%,

262
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,320
with some paying up to 29%.

263
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,560
And that, that interest is on top
of mark-ups and add-ons

264
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,640
that can inflate the price of the car.

265
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,480
So just look at Arlene Jones.

266
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,000
She went into a Chicago dealership,
trusting that they would help her.

267
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,160
When she first got
to the Quick Auto lot,

268
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,320
she told the salesman
she had an upper limit on price.

269
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,360
So I said, I can't afford no car
over two, three thousand dollars.

270
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,640
She says he was very reassuring.

271
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,320
Like, don't worry about it.
He said, you can handle it.

272
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,520
In the end, Arlene borrowed  $8,600

273
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,320
at 24.9% interest over three years.

274
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,600
If she had paid off the loan,

275
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,360
she would have spent
more  than $13,000

276
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,960
on a car that was only worth
about three thousand.

277
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,800
Holy shit ! That is outrageous.
The only way it's acceptable

278
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,400
to sell someone a $3,000 car
for $13,000

279
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,760
is if you slip a mint condition X-men
issue one in the glove compartment.

280
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,480
But it's no wonder
that "buy here, pay here" loans

281
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,320
had an average default rate last year
of nearly one in three.

282
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,480
With most customers
who default doing so

283
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,000
just seven months after taking out
the loan.

284
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,600
Just think about that.
Seven months is not a lot of time.

285
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,000
If you put a seven-month old baby
in front of the screen right now,

286
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,600
it would not understand anything
I'm saying.

287
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,000
It wouldn't even know
if I was making fun of it.

288
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,560
I'll show you. Go ahead,
get a baby right now

289
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,920
and put it in front of the screen,
here we go.

290
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,160
Hi dummy ! Hey ! You don't know

291
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,960
that I'm mocking you
to your stupid widdle face, do you ?

292
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,080
No you don't ! No you don't !

293
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,800
Who knows about that ! Not you !
You don't mind, you don't mind at all !

294
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,160
See ? Seven months is not long
enough to do anything,

295
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,280
now put the kid to bed,
you're a terrible parent.

296
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,680
But the problem is, the problem is,

297
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,520
even if you're just a few days late
on a payment,

298
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,800
the dealership can repossess your car.

299
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,760
And when they do, sometimes, it is
with little regard for what's inside.

300
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,520
When the mother went to pick up
her three children at a daycare

301
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,800
she left her nine month old in the car,

302
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,640
but when she came out there was
no baby  and no car.

303
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,960
I wish when you repo a car you check
the car before you take it.

304
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,040
That's really it...

305
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,520
Just don't,
you know take nobody's baby.

306
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:10,520
Yes, exactly. Don't take a baby
is a good general rule for everyone.

307
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,600
Whether you are repossessing a car,
choosing a prom date,

308
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,560
or making a selection
in the NFL draft: don't take a baby.

309
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,000
You don't take a baby. I don't care
what they did in the combine.

310
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,600
And, and increasingly,
it is not difficult

311
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,560
for "buy here, pay here" dealerships
to repossess your car.

312
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,040
Because many now install
a special device

313
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,440
which goes off
when your payment is due.

314
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,840
Every five seconds the device is
actually beeping at them,

315
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,320
all the way taking their kids
to school, all the way to work.

316
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,240
It's informing them that they need
to make their payment.

317
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,280
However, if they don't,
then the device, at midnight,

318
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,760
most lenders choose midnight
as their time of shut-off,

319
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,080
the device will not allow that car
to start.

320
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,680
Okay, setting aside the horror
of the fact they can shut your car off,

321
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,200
that beeping sound
is unbelievably annoying.

322
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,480
Anyone with a smoke detector knows:

323
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,960
it only takes about 30 minutes
of incessant beeping

324
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,600
before you've completely lost
your mind.

325
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,920
"I pushed the button,
unscrewed the top,"

326
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
"and smashed the whole thing
with the bread maker,"

327
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,480
"so the only reasonable option is now
to set my fucking house on fire."

328
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,760
And once they have repossessed
your car,

329
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,640
these dealers don't have to refund
your down payment.

330
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,000
And they might decide
you still owe them money,

331
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,920
because the car is now worth less
than they sold it to you for.

332
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,360
So you can easily end up with no car
and thousands of dollars in debt.

333
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,240
Meanwhile, the dealer can turn around
and sell your car to someone else.

334
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,200
So the truth is,
they can make money either way.

335
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,000
And the same car can get sold this way
over and over again.

336
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,480
And to prove that, let me take you
on a magical journey.

337
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,200
Because a few years ago,
the LA Times tracked the sales

338
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,680
of one car from a Kansas City
buy-here-pay-here dealer.

339
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,640
It was a 2003 Kia Optima,
much like this one.

340
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,040
It had a bluebook value of $5,350

341
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,800
but in April of 2008, it was sold
for nearly 11,000

342
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,240
or double its blue book value.

343
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,520
The original buyer
complained of mechanical problems

344
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,320
and refused to make payments,
so the car was repossessed

345
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,640
and sold again in August, before being
repossessed again four months later,

346
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,360
and was then re-sold
after just three weeks,

347
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,920
before being repossessed again
from a mother of three

348
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,000
who, without transportation,
lost her job at Wal-Mart.

349
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,640
It was then re-sold again in May 2009,

350
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,440
to an owner who complained
of transmission trouble,

351
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,160
so the dealer took it back,
and re-sold it just four weeks later,

352
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,200
after which it was, you'll never guess,
repossessed again

353
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,800
from an owner who later filed
for bankruptcy,

354
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,640
thanks in part to payments he owed
on this piece of shit demon car.

355
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,040
But wait: we are not done.
It was sold again that December,

356
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,600
and was repossessed
just five months later,

357
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,320
before being re-sold in May.

358
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,960
And it was then, surprise surprise,
repossessed again,

359
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,880
even though the owner,
a mother of four,

360
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,680
claimed she made every payment.
And then it was sold one last time,

361
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,920
before being repossessed
just one month later.

362
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,120
That one car changed hands
eight times in three years,

363
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,920
each time at a price double,
or even triple, its blue book value.

364
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,200
At which point, you almost feel bad
for the car,

365
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,840
which presumably needed
two sessions of therapy a week

366
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,560
just to be able to start
its crappy engine again.

367
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,480
Now, now that, that is where
the LA Times left it,

368
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,800
but we felt so emotionally involved,
we actually tracked that car down,

369
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,000
and discovered that since then,
it has been sold again,

370
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,840
repossessed again,
and then sold yet again,

371
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,200
and when we called the last listed
owner, she said it had been stolen,

372
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,680
and I really hope whoever did that

373
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,680
drove it straight off a fucking cliff.

374
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,680
Although, I'm guessing even then,

375
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,960
some sleazy lobster wound up selling it
to a poor unsuspecting fish.

376
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,840
Now, now after seeing that,

377
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,680
you may be glad to hear that
buy-here-pay-here lending

378
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,000
has lost market share
in recent years.

379
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,480
Unfortunately, that is only because

380
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,840
it seems everyone is getting
into subprime auto lending now.

381
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,160
There is a surprising amount
of competition

382
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,840
to give car loans
to people with poor credit,

383
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,920
so much so, people who've recently
declared bankruptcy

384
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,440
are being actively targeted
through the mail.

385
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,920
Just listen to one bankruptcy lawyer
describe what he's seen.

386
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,600
These are all car loan solicitations.

387
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,800
High interest car loan solicitations
sent to my bankrupt clients,

388
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,600
people who have already
filed bankruptcy.

389
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,320
Here's one that looks like a check,
and it's made out to $21,000.

390
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,680
I guess it's gonna be a used car,
with a signature and everything.

391
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,640
Here's one that looks like
some kind of an official certificate.

392
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,240
They encourage you to apply
for a car loan,

393
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,800
even if you've suffered bankruptcy,
car repossession,

394
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,800
foreclosure, or all of the above.

395
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,840
That is a slightly weird tone of voice
to use there.

396
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,040
He sounds almost excited

397
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,280
about  a bankruptcy, a car
repossession "and" a foreclosure.

398
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,200
It's like the doctor saying,

399
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,080
"Wow, you have herpes,
HPV and gonorrhea."

400
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,240
"Most people only get one !
You've got the hat trick !"

401
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,600
And, and this feeding frenzy
over subprime customers

402
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,200
now includes big lenders,
like Santander and GM financial.

403
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,320
They have both expanded
their subprime auto financing,

404
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,520
and there are newer players,
like Skopos and Exeter,

405
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,960
who specialize in subprime lending.

406
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,840
And you might be wondering why
the fuck is everyone in such a hurry

407
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,080
to lend money
to people with bad credit ?

408
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,440
In the mortgage crisis,they were
doing that so that they could

409
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,680
bundle those high-interest loans
together and sell them on Wall Street,

410
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,360
but there is absolutely no way
that that is happening...

411
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,480
That is happening again. That is
exactly what is happening right now.

412
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,120
And people have actually been worried
about this for a while now.

413
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,000
Is there a new bubble that's about
to burst in the auto sector ?

414
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,080
Does this concern you at all though

415
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,920
that it could possibly become
a repeat of the home loan boom ?

416
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,840
Do you see similarities between
the housing crisis

417
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,360
and what's going on now
with used car loans ?

418
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,400
Is there concern now that there's going
to be another subprime crisis,

419
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,560
except it's not going to be mortgages,
it's gonna be car loans ?

420
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,680
Yes, there is concern

421
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,640
that this could be the subprime
mortgage crisis but with cars.

422
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,520
And normally, if you add
the phrase "but with cars"

423
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,560
to any historical event,
it sounds a lot more fun.

424
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,160
Like "the Assassination
of Abraham Lincoln, but with cars."

425
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,120
Sadly, this is the exception
to that rule.

426
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,160
Now, before you panic, experts say
there are important differences here.

427
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,880
Subprime auto loans are a much
smaller part of the overall economy

428
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,040
than subprime mortgages were,
so even if they do go bust,

429
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,320
this wouldn't necessarily be
"The Big Short" all over again,

430
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,800
so much as
the direct-to-video version,

431
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,280
with Brad Garrett
instead of Brad Pitt,

432
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,040
and instead of Ryan Gosling,
an actual gosling named Ryan.

433
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,080
And Wall Street firms insist
that they have learned their lesson,

434
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,160
and have set things up in such a way
that tons of loans can default,

435
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,440
and investors will still be fine.

436
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,240
But there are trouble signs.

437
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,640
For instance, standards for some of
the loans being sold as investments

438
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,800
can be shockingly lax.

439
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,680
We've seen deals come to market
with very low FICO scores

440
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,840
and in some cases with
no credit scores at all for loans.

441
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,920
Some people joke

442
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,440
that you really just need a pulse right
now to get a subprime auto loan so...

443
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,600
That's a good joke.
Solid setup, hard punch line,

444
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,360
potentially devastating effect
on the American economy.

445
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,640
Top-shelf comedy there,
it's the rule of threes is what it is.

446
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,960
And behind closed doors,
some in the lending industry

447
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,200
openly acknowledge
conditions are deteriorating.

448
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,520
In fact, when we sent hidden cameras
to a debt buyers conference in Vegas

449
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,200
a few months ago, we stumbled
on Ken Shilson,

450
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,400
the head of the National Alliance
of Buy Here Pay Here Dealers.

451
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,200
He sees trouble brewing, because
he thinks in attempting to keep pace

452
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,080
with the big players
who've entered the subprime industry,

453
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,920
his own dealers are being forced
to issue longer-term loans

454
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,880
with less money down
at higher cost to clients

455
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,400
who are therefore
at greater risk of default.

456
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,400
And these broader lending trends are
clearly terrible news for borrowers,

457
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,280
but to hear him tell it,
it's a great opportunity

458
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,320
for those who buy bad debts
and collect on them.

459
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,880
These people have negative equity
all the way through

460
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,160
and they're not gonna be able to hold
their life together for seven years.

461
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,480
You know the customer.
You know how to collect.

462
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,840
You've got the legal expertise.
What's holding you back ?

463
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,960
That is both inspirational
and profoundly upsetting.

464
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,640
It's like if the song
"I believe I can fly"

465
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,760
merged with the rest
of R. Kelly's life.

466
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,520
Listen, listen... The news,
the news, don't Google that.

467
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,360
Listen, the news that used-car dealers
are predatory is clearly not new.

468
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,920
But it seems these days,
market pressures are forcing them

469
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,240
to be more aggressive and take
more risks,  to the point where

470
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,720
we may be getting close
to an industry that looks like this.

471
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,080
CRAZY JOHNNY'S USED CARS

472
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,040
Well howdy there, folks !

473
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,680
Do you need a car ?
You can't afford a car ?

474
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,600
No problem ! Just come right
on down today to Crazy Johnny's !

475
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,840
But don't take it from me. Take it
from my cousin, crazy Jimmy !

476
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,280
Come on out here, Jimmy !

477
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,920
Hello, crazy Johnny,

478
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,960
I love the smell of deals
in the morning !

479
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,880
I got a question for the people
at home, do you have bad credit ?

480
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,440
We don't care !

481
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,120
- Have you filed for bankruptcy ?
- We don't care !

482
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,160
Is your credit so bad that giving you

483
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,640
a high-interest loan will basically
trap you under a mountain of debt ?

484
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,080
We don't give a fuck !

485
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,400
And if you come in today,

486
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,800
we've got a beautiful offer
for you right now, man.

487
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,400
This here is

488
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,200
a pre-pre-pre pre-pre-pre-owned
2003 Kia Optima !

489
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,320
It's aggressively bland.

490
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,680
Jimmy, Jimmy, you gotta tell
the people what it comes with.

491
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,120
I will it comes fully loaded
with four tires, up to one engine,

492
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,560
and a beeping device which emits
a sound that will haunt your dreams !

493
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,520
- Does it come with anything else ?
- It does man.

494
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,080
If you check the backseat,
this car has a fucking baby in it !

495
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,880
There is an actual baby
in this car right now !

496
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,240
I have serious personal reservations
about the situation this child is in !

497
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,280
Don't focus on that,
look this car is worth $2,000.

498
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,880
But we'll let you have it
for zero down,

499
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,040
and just two hundred a month
for the next seven years !

500
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,520
That's nearly $17,000 !

501
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,120
- No no no no !
- Nearly $17,000 !

502
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,280
Don't do the actual math on that !
Try and think of it at home like this:

503
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,920
act now, and this car will affect
every financial decision

504
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,320
you make
for the best part of the next decade !

505
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,680
And that is a crazy Johnny promise !

506
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,600
And the crazy thing is,
this piece of shit car

507
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,480
is actually an opportunity
for Wall Street, too.

508
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,840
But don't listen to me, listen
to our accountant, crazy Walter !

509
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,520
Come on out here, Walter !

510
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,720
Come on out here Walter !

511
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,000
Well, it's true.

512
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,840
If you set aside the human misery
this loan has the potential to cause,

513
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,040
as part
of an over-collateralized security,

514
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,240
this can be sold as a, as a,
as a high yield investment.

515
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,600
Damn, Walter ! That has disturbing
echoes of the mortgage crisis !

516
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,800
The point is, it is so easy for us
to get you in this car,

517
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,720
why, it is almost criminal !

518
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,520
It truly feels like it should be
a criminal activity !

519
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,680
And yet, somehow it isn't.

520
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,200
That's our show ! Thank you so much
for joining us !

521
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,520
See you next week ! Good night !

522
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,160
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
with JOHN OLIVER
