LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,600
SEASON III
EPISODE 16

3
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,360
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
Thank you so much for joining us.

4
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,520
I am John Oliver.

5
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,480
Let's begin with the story that has
dominated the news all this week:

6
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,040
the aftermath
of the shootings in Orlando.

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,320
Everyone has had their own ideas
on the root of the problem.

8
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,360
It will not surprise you to hear where
the worst of those ideas came from.

9
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,320
I've been saying for a long time
it's going to happen.

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,600
We are taking in thousands of people
into our country.

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,800
We have no idea where they come from.
We have no idea who the hell they are.

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,200
There is a great deal wrong with that,
not least the fact that we know exactly

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,720
where this shooter came from,
because he was born in Queens.

14
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,960
About 8 miles
from where Donald Trump was born

15
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,080
presumably when a racist fairy
brought a butternut squash to life.

16
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,560
Democrats focused less on the shooter,
and more on the weapons he used,

17
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,200
even springing a surprise filibuster
on the floor of the senate.

18
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,280
Democrats led by Chris Murphy
held the floor for nearly 15 hours

19
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,600
pushing for new regulations
to stop people on the terror watchlist

20
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,440
from buying guns
and to expand background checks.

21
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,160
After nearly 15 hours,

22
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,240
Murphy said he had gotten signals
that his 2 measures would get a vote.

23
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,800
Is he absolutely sure
he saw those signals ?

24
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,440
Or was that a hallucination
brought on by ammonia poisoning

25
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,720
after holding his pee in
for 15 hours ?

26
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,160
Those proposals
are actually coming up for a vote,

27
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,640
but before you get your hopes up,
there may be a bit of a problem.

28
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,120
Let's not kid ourselves.

29
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,280
The Republicans
control the house of representatives,

30
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,440
there is never going to be
any gun control that passes.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,040
That's true.

32
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,160
Closing the gun-show loophole in
this congress is incredibly unlikely.

33
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,280
Even regulating the gun show
Paul Ryan puts on every day

34
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,120
is pretty much
a lost cause at this point.

35
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,760
Which means here we are again,
after another mass shooting,

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,200
with weak legislation
doomed to failure.

37
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,560
And there is clearly a disconnect
between public opinion,

38
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,360
which favors, to varying degrees,
different gun control measures

39
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,400
and any practical action
in Washington.

40
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,240
And it is pretty clear what is standing
between those two things:

41
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,400
the National Rifle Association.

42
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,000
Like PETA,
but for guns, and effective.

43
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,800
And to be fair,
to be fair to the NRA:

44
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,400
it's not surprising they take
a hard line on gun legislation.

45
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,800
They're an advocacy group.
It's what they're supposed to do.

46
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,120
What is shocking is just
how successful they've been at it.

47
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,240
Look at the last big failed
attempt at gun control,

48
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,560
known as
the Manchin-Toomey amendment.

49
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,240
There were high hopes for that.
Partly 'cause it didn't do much,

50
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,000
it called for background checks
at gun shows and for online sales.

51
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,000
But mainly because Joe Manchin,
who cosponsored it,

52
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,440
had some credibility
regarding firearms.

53
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,120
I'll protect our 2nd amendment rights.
That's why the NRA endorsed me.

54
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,880
And I'll take dead aim
at the cap-and-trade bill.

55
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,880
Holy shit. That is a guy
so comfortable with guns,

56
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,320
he basically just used one
as a hole punch.

57
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,160
His office's three-hole punch
must be fucking terrifying.

58
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,560
And Manchin did everything
he could to appease the NRA.

59
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,480
He even inserted several
of their direct requests into his bill

60
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,120
including allowing firearms dealers,
for the first time since 1968,

61
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,720
to sell handguns across state lines.

62
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,920
Which is a weird provision
to put in a gun-control bill.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,600
It's like letting Jose Cuervo
convince you that the seventh step

64
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,560
in Alcoholic's Anonymous
should be tequila shots.

65
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,840
But despite all that, the NRA
turned on Manchin and the bill,

66
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,400
and then punished him by running
ads like this in his home state.

67
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,480
Manchin is working
with President Obama

68
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,720
and New York mayor
Michael Bloomberg.

69
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,440
Concerned ? You should be.

70
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,680
Yes, the NRA
stabbed Manchin in the back.

71
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,160
It would've been more on-brand
of them to shoot him in the back,

72
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,720
and argue it never would've
happened if his back had had a gun.

73
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,840
And the thing is whenever
any potential regulation comes up,

74
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,840
the pushback is always the same.

75
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,320
No evidence that gun laws
would prevent shootings.

76
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,040
There is at least
an absence of certain proof,

77
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,960
as to the efficacy
of gun ownership laws in the past.

78
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,960
To think that somehow gun control
is, or increased gun control,

79
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,240
is the answer, in my view
that would have to be proved.

80
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,560
It's the old "I'm not doing anything
until you can prove it" argument,

81
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,680
the same argument
favored by climate-change deniers

82
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,640
and fathers of the baby on Maury.

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,160
Happy Father's Day !

84
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,200
The point is that brings us

85
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,080
to perhaps the most ingenious
and insidious NRA tactic.

86
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,040
They don't just manage
to block legislation concerning guns.

87
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,480
They've managed to block
information concerning them, too.

88
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,160
One of the major funders
of academic research,

89
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,120
the Centers for Disease Control,

90
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,720
has been hamstrung in studying
how best to prevent gun violence

91
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,400
for the last twenty years.

92
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,720
In 1996,
the NRA successfully lobbied congress

93
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,520
to put this restriction
into the CDC's budget:

94
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,200
"... none of the funds may be used
to advocate or promote gun control."

95
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,720
The CDC was already banned
from advocating for gun control laws,

96
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,240
or, indeed, any form of legislation.

97
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,240
But the 1996 Dickey amendment
named after both its sponsor,

98
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,240
Jay Dickey, and after the fact
it was an extremely dickey thing to do

99
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,720
had a chilling effect on the CDC
funding any gun research at all.

100
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,840
CDC funding into gun violence research
has plummeted 96 percent since 1996,

101
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:28,320
to just $100,000 of last year's
$5.6 billion dollar CDC budget.

102
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,840
The only other things that've dropped
96 percent in the last two decades

103
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,960
are Lycos searches
and Tickle-me-Elmo-related stampedes.

104
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,760
It's not just CDC struggling to collect
reliable gun-related information.

105
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,520
For decades, the NRA has successfully
lobbied to prevent the ATF

106
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,240
from having a database that
is electronically searchable by name

107
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,440
when tracing the origins of firearms.

108
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
This is what they have to do

109
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,880
with documents from gun shops
that've gone out of business.

110
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,160
Workers are left with an antiquated
system to trace 350,000 guns a year,

111
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,040
requiring them to review
by hand tons of paper records

112
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,760
and 500 million entries
on microfilm.

113
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,400
Many of the records
are barely legible.

114
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,160
These are records that we received
as a result of Hurricane Katrina.

115
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,720
We had to dry these out
in the parking lot.

116
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,880
That is clearly absurd.

117
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,800
That does not look like a present day
record of gun ownership.

118
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,920
It looks like the manifesto from
a Spanish galleon that sank in 1610.

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,040
So how the fuck has the NRA managed
to accomplish all of this ?

120
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,880
Because they're not
that large an organization

121
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,160
they claim they have a membership
of around 5 million.

122
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,920
But that is 3 million fewer members
than Planet Fitness.

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,720
And the members of Planet Fitness
have almost no power.

124
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,640
Most of them don't even have the power
to actually go to Planet Fitness.

125
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,200
And that is true. By mid-January,
that place is nothing more

126
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,560
than a storage facility
for grape colored exercise bikes.

127
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,560
And while the NRA
does spend a lot of money lobbying,

128
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,000
they are frequently
outspent by even the NAR,

129
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,840
or National Association of Realtors,
a group of wily bastards

130
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,600
who have somehow convinced us
we need to live indoors like nerds.

131
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,120
But the real power of the NRA
is in its members,

132
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,440
who are highly motivated,
and can be mobilized quickly.

133
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,720
At the website of the NRA's
political action committee

134
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,240
you will find alerts for every piece
of legislation around the country.

135
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,920
And not just
"write your congressman" alerts,

136
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,120
alerts like, "the following bills
are scheduled to be heard on June 14",

137
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,800
"at 9 am, in room 126
of the State Capitol".

138
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,360
Because they know:
their members often show up.

139
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,240
One of the reasons they're able
to rally their base so effectively

140
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,680
is they have an appealingly
simple message.

141
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,760
It's all about a single issue.

142
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,840
There's no four-point plan
that they have to defend.

143
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,360
I would point out,
they only have to say 'no.'

144
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,480
They're not for anything.
They're against something.

145
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,360
A single issue. One word: 'no'.

146
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,040
Exactly.

147
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,240
It's a lot easier to drum up support
when you're flatly against something.

148
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,880
There is a reason that TLC
insisted upon "No Scrubs",

149
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,360
and not the implementation of a
national registry of potential scrubs,

150
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,480
AKA "busters", that would screen
for scrub-like tendencies

151
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,640
or affiliations with known scrubs.

152
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,000
They knew,
"No Scrubs" is a lot catchier.

153
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,560
And the truth about politics is,
it's about showing up.

154
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,160
Remember the Manchin-Toomey
amendment ?

155
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,000
A national poll at that time
found that 88 percent of people

156
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,600
supported
universal background checks,

157
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,400
and yet Manchin's office maintains
that, of the calls it received,

158
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,440
they ran 200-to-1
in opposition to the bill.

159
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,600
And that is why it is important
to actually call your congressman.

160
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,720
You can't just hit them up
on Twitter or Facebook.

161
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,280
Because you won't get
a personal response,

162
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,800
or, even worse, you'll get
a very personal response indeed.

163
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,800
Put it away Carlos, put it away.

164
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,000
And remember the Dickey amendment,

165
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,840
which has effectively kept the CDC
from studying gun violence ?

166
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,400
It is now opposed by both the American
Medical Association and Jay Dickey,

167
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,880
the man who sponsored it
in the first place.

168
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,480
Whenever a member of Congress
tries to kill it

169
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,280
as Nita Lowey did last summer,
this is how it goes.

170
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,880
Let's support research
to prevent gun violence,

171
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,840
protect our communities
and save lives. Thank you.

172
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,000
The question is on the Lowey
amendment. All in favor say aye.

173
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,280
Aye.

174
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,320
- All opposed say no.
- No.

175
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,000
The no's have it.
The amendment is not agreed to.

176
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,600
It's like watching
a committee of deer

177
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,080
voting against investigating
the effects of oncoming cars.

178
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,120
"Let's stand still. I like our chances.
And those headlights are shiny."

179
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,040
And if you're thinking,
"I'm sure, after Orlando,"

180
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,280
"if someone tries that they'll succeed
'cause we're all paying attention".

181
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,120
Here's the thing about that...

182
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,880
Representative Tony Cardenas tried to
overturn it again just this Wednesday,

183
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,560
with an amendment to a mentalhealth
bill, and this was the result.

184
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,440
- All those in favor will say aye.
- Aye.

185
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,040
- All those opposed say no.
- No.

186
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,440
The no's have it.

187
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,240
Are you fucking kidding me ?
That happened four days ago.

188
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm guessing that you're hearing
about it for the first time now.

189
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,840
To be honest,
we only found out about it yesterday.

190
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,400
And we've been working
on this story all week.

191
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,360
The Dickey amendment is emblematic
of a chokehold the NRA has

192
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,480
over even basic gun data.

193
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,840
And it should obviously
be overturned.

194
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,200
But the hard truth is, NRA members
seem to care more consistently

195
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,120
about preventing gun control
than most of us do about passing it.

196
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,280
While you might be
focused on gun control now,

197
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,040
they were focused on it
two weeks before Orlando,

198
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,080
and they'll still be focused
on it two weeks from now.

199
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,240
Here I would say:

200
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,760
"Tell your senator and representative
to repeal the Dickey amendment".

201
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,480
And you should absolutely do that
if you want to.

202
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,080
But you are going to need to do
more than that.

203
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,800
You're going to need to call them
and "remind" them to repeal it.

204
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,920
Then call them on their birthday:

205
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,200
"Happy birthday and also get rid
of the Dickey amendment."

206
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,280
Call them on Arbor Day and say:
"Happy Arbor Day !"

207
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,080
"What's going on
with that Dickey amendment ?"

208
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,400
Call them on days
where there wasn't a mass shooting,

209
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,200
and say: "What the fuck's up
with the Dickey amendment ?"

210
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,760
Repealing it is not asking much.
It's not gun control.

211
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,880
It's enabling us
to have an informed conversation

212
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,000
about what that could look like.

213
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,560
If and when a proposal
you like is on the table,

214
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,480
you're going to have
to make all those calls again.

215
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,040
Because remember, it doesn't take
much to outnumber the NRA.

216
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,240
Planet Fitness members
outnumber them.

217
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,960
But it is time for us to learn
what those members haven't:

218
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,920
if you want to see serious changes,
you have to show up every fucking day.

219
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,960
And now, this.

220
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,360
And now, 60 Minutes anchors
are still prompting people

221
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,000
to deliver
the exact sound bite they need.

222
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,480
He's a notorious
tunnel manufacturer and architect.

223
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,880
The tunnel king.

224
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,680
Not without controversy.

225
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,080
A collector of trophies.

226
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,640
Dirty money.

227
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,640
Bad actors.

228
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,400
Both are false.

229
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,480
Not the varsity team.

230
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,720
East German secret police.

231
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,280
Alarms were going off.

232
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,480
Took 16 years.

233
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,840
- You were Cockney...
- I was a Cockney.

234
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,360
The class system
was that rigid...

235
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,520
Just accept that.
They're going to get in.

236
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,760
Didn't want to get his pants dirty.

237
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,160
The doo-wop.

238
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,560
You touch it.

239
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,960
And then they go home.

240
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,120
F-bird.

241
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,640
That's what happened.

242
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,920
Just like that.

243
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,440
- Nailed it ?
- Nailed it.

244
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:17,080
Moving on: our main story
tonight concerns the United Kingdom.

245
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,760
Birthplace of the Beatles and yet
very much the world's Ringo.

246
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,960
On Thursday, the UK faces an in-out
referendum on whether to leave the EU.

247
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,560
Incidentally, an "in-out referendum"
is what most English people call sex:

248
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,680
I say, that was a jolly good
in-out referendum, Priscilla.

249
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,840
Capital stuff, old girl !
Simply capital !

250
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,520
You may not have heard
about this referendum,

251
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,640
unless you watch financial networks,
it's referred to by a catchy name.

252
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,640
A lot of fear in the marketplace about
the Brexit vote.

253
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,640
Brexit fear is getting traction.

254
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,720
A new survey
focuses on Brexit fears.

255
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,960
Brexit is one of the major concerns.

256
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,640
I think that the scariest thing
about Brexit is the name Brexit.

257
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,080
Because it's unknown. It's like:
Brexit, be afraid, conjuring Brexit.

258
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,160
Okay, calm down.
"Brexit" doesn't sound scary.

259
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,720
It just sounds like a shitty
granola bar you buy at the airport:

260
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,360
this tastes like
a preserved owl pellet.

261
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,360
Fuck it, I'm going to Cinnabon,
you pushed me into it !

262
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,400
If you are watching this outside the
UK, you're probably thinking:

263
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,560
Why should I care about what
Britain does with the EU ?

264
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,440
As long as those crooked-toothed
scone goblins keep shooting out

265
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,520
royal babies
and "Doctor Who",

266
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,280
I don't give a tally-ho fuck
what happens there.

267
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,680
And fair enough.

268
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,520
But a "Brexit", or British exit,
could have wide-ranging implications,

269
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,840
for the UK
and the world's economy.

270
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,600
It might help to understand what
the European Union actually is.

271
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,320
The idea for it came after
the Second World War,

272
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:00,120
a desire to keep the continent
from tearing itself apart yet again.

273
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,080
It has since evolved into an economic
union of 28 countries,

274
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,360
whose citizens can trade
and move freely across borders,

275
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,440
and who negotiate international
agreements as a bloc.

276
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,800
Britain has always had an arm's
length relationship with the EU.

277
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,160
It doesn't use the Euro,
some British politicians

278
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,040
have been openly hostile,
right to the face of EU officials.

279
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:28,200
I don't want to be rude, but you
have the charisma of a damp rag

280
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,880
and the appearance
of a low-grade bank clerk.

281
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,600
And the question that I want to
ask, that we're all going to ask,

282
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,880
is who are you ?!

283
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:40,080
I'd never heard of you. Nobody in
Europe had ever heard of you.

284
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,200
That is painful to watch,
and not just because

285
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,960
all of those insults are things people
in the UK have said about me.

286
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,880
The EU is not perfect.

287
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,560
It's large, confounding
and relentlessly bureaucratic.

288
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,640
Think of it like Gerard Depardieu:

289
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,000
it's an unwieldy European body
that's a source of great bewilderment.

290
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,160
But Britain leaving it would be
a huge, destabilizing decision.

291
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,320
So you would expect the Brexit camp
to have some pretty solid arguments.

292
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,360
Many of them are bullshit.
One of the most popular

293
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,880
involves the financial contributions
Britain makes to the EU.

294
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,640
We've got an opportunity to take
back control in this country

295
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,920
of huge sums of money that
we send every year to Brussels,

296
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,160
about 350 million pounds a week.

297
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,400
That is former London mayor
Boris Johnson,

298
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,040
a man with look and economic insight
of Bam-Bam from the Flintstones.

299
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,960
He has even been driven around
in a giant red bus,

300
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,680
with the words "we send the EU 350
million pounds a week" written.

301
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,560
But that number has been
thoroughly debunked.

302
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,280
It's actually about 190 million
pounds a week,

303
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,360
when you consider a rebate and
money that the EU sends back.

304
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,200
If Britain does leave the EU it may
have to spend close to that amount

305
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,240
just to access the common market.

306
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,840
What the bus should say is:
"we send EU 190 million pounds a week"

307
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,240
"which as a proportion of our
GDP makes sound fiscal sense."

308
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,080
"Considering the benefits we reap,
we're running out of bus ! Bye !"

309
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,880
One of the other main talking
points from pro-Brexit campaigners

310
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,280
has been
the EU's onerous regulations.

311
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,560
It's even a centerpiece
of the pro-Brexit movie,

312
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,320
"Brexit: The Movie".

313
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,560
Here is regulated EU man,
waking from his regulated slumber

314
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,240
to start his regulated day.

315
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,200
You wouldn't think you'd need
a law for pillowcases, EU has five.

316
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,680
But that's nothing. The pillow inside
is subject to 109 different EU laws.

317
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,960
But is it, though ?
Because we blew up that frame,

318
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,680
and then went looking through
each of the pillow regulations.

319
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,480
Most have nothing
to do with actual pillows.

320
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,440
This is a classification of a type of
cereal that comes in "pillow shapes".

321
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,440
This one is related to a merger
between two auto-part companies

322
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,200
that included
the phrase "pillow ball joints",

323
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,120
and this one uses the word
"pillow" in reference

324
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,520
to this weird foot pump thing,

325
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,520
which is supposedly for
inflating air mattresses

326
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,880
but is clearly a sex doll
for a platypus.

327
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,840
It's so obvious
what that actually is.

328
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,200
It seems the benefits of leaving
may be overstated.

329
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,040
There's a great many people
warning about a real downside.

330
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,520
President Obama is against Britain
leaving. So is China. So is Japan.

331
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,360
So is India. And the EU itself.

332
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,040
One Austrian politician tried to
convince Britain with a poem.

333
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,920
The Brexit is, to put it simple,
not like an ordinary pimple

334
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,720
you take some cream, put it on,
a few days later it is gone.

335
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,920
It is a complicated matter
more like a novel, not a letter.

336
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,520
To understand the story
well you've got to listen,

337
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,680
I will tell you what may happen
so sit back, and let me rappin'.

338
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:21,080
Cool. Come on, Britain,
if a middle-aged Austrian bureaucrat

339
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,000
spitting dope half-rhymes
in a busy hallway,

340
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,600
if he does not win you over,
nobody will.

341
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,840
There's also overwhelming consensus
about the damage Britain could do

342
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,520
to its economy by leaving.

343
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,960
Reports by the British
Treasury, the Bank of England,

344
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,960
the IMF, the OECD, National Institute
of Economic and Social Research,

345
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,280
Price Waterhouse,
Oxford Economics,

346
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,160
Centre for Economic
Performance have predicted

347
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,640
that leaving would have a negative
effect on the British GDP.

348
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,160
The pro-Brexit camp's
response to that has not been great.

349
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,720
People in this country
have had enough of experts

350
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,920
with organizations from acronyms
saying...

351
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,560
Saying that they know what is best
and getting it consistently wrong.

352
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,360
Yes, fuck these eggheads
with their studies and degrees !

353
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,320
I get my economic forecasts from
Otis, the GDP predictin' horse !

354
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:24,360
You may be wondering: if leaving
is so universally seen as a bad idea,

355
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,640
then who the
fuck is in favor of it ?

356
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,160
Let me introduce you to one of the
leading groups backing a Brexit,

357
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,960
the UK Independence Party,
also called UKIP.

358
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,440
Their leader is Nigel Farage,
that man you saw earlier

359
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:43,040
at the Roast of European Council
President Herman van Rompoy.

360
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,880
UKIP is known for its hardline
anti-immigration views

361
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,120
and some of its members
have engaged in outright racism.

362
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,280
Look at Robert Blay,
a UKIP candidate for parliament,

363
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,440
who was suspended after a tabloid
caught him saying this

364
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,600
about a rival
of Sri Lankan descent.

365
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,920
His family's only been
here since the seventies.

366
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,120
You are not British enough
to be in our parliament.

367
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,040
"Not British enough
to be in our parliament" ?

368
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,440
He's talking about a British citizen

369
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,160
who was born in London
and raised in Hampshire !

370
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,040
How is that not "British enough" ?
Must he literally be a monocle badger

371
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,760
named Reginald
who lives in a Shepherd's pie ?

372
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,320
Is that the bar of entry to him ?

373
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:33,320
UKIP has had councilors like this
woman, on a district council in Kent.

374
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,120
I have to watch my tongue,
because I can be very outspoken,

375
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,320
and it goes against the grain.

376
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,560
The only people I do have
problems with are negroes.

377
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,880
And I don't know why.

378
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,160
Let's agree, it is now official:

379
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,240
not everything sounds
smarter in a British accent.

380
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,160
It is absolutely, 100% official.

381
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,720
What you heard is horrifying,
but at least we can all rest easy

382
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,800
knowing that, as she speaks,
that shelf full of clowns

383
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,760
is plotting to carry her away
into the night forever.

384
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,680
But even when UKIP candidates
are caught making racist comments,

385
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,800
Farage has stood by them,
look at Kerry Smith,

386
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,480
who used a racial slur
about Chinese people.

387
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,600
A term I'm not going to use,
because I'm not a candidate for UKIP.

388
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,960
But Nigel Farage
did not exactly condemn him.

389
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,160
If you were going out for Chinese,
what do you say you're going for ?

390
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,880
I would not use
the word chinky, would you ?

391
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,280
No, but a lot of people would.

392
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,320
Yeah, a lot of people would.
Racists, for example. Bigots.

393
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,200
Idiots, the intolerant...
Who am I missing here ?

394
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,320
Yeah, UKIP voters.
Them, as well. A lot of people would.

395
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,760
UKIP argue that a Brexit would
enable the UK to reduce immigration,

396
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,960
preventing both EU citizens
from taking British jobs

397
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,560
and non-EU citizens from sneaking
in to commit terror attacks.

398
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,480
They have not been subtle,
with toxic posters like this one,

399
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,200
showing lines of refugees and
the headline "Breaking Point".

400
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,760
It is hard for me to overstate to you

401
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,520
how poisonous things have
become in England.

402
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,440
MP Jo Cox was killed in the street,
and the man charged for it

403
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,800
gave his name in court as "death
to traitors, freedom for Britain".

404
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,560
In that cauldron, people are being
asked to make a major decision.

405
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,160
Incidentally, regarding immigration,

406
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,000
even if you believe tightening borders
is what Britain needs to do,

407
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:41,680
opting out of the EU will not
enable Britain to do that.

408
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,360
Leaving the EU, does that mean
UK gets control of its borders ?

409
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,360
It could do, if we cut ourselves
off from the rest of Europe.

410
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,560
We could choose to end migration.
But if we remain part of the market,

411
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,320
that means accepting
free mobility of labor.

412
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,680
If Britain wants a good trade
deal with the EU,

413
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,400
it's going to have to abide
by most of its rules.

414
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,960
And the same goes for all
those hypothetically cumbersome,

415
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,440
non-pillow-related
pillow regulations.

416
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,320
If British companies want
to trade with the EU,

417
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,480
they also are going to have to abide
by those rules anyway.

418
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:23,560
So, it's not a Brexit so much as it's
a "Bratus Quo", or a "Bromeostasis",

419
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,680
or a "Conscious Unbroupling".

420
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,760
So, to recap:
immigration policy may not change,

421
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,240
hysteria overregulation
is a red herring,

422
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,040
and the economic benefits of
staying appear to outweigh the costs.

423
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:43,400
And yet, polls suggest my homeland is
on the edge of doing something insane.

424
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,000
And on some level,
I actually kind of understand.

425
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,240
There is an innate British desire to
tell Europe to go fuck itself.

426
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,200
I feel it, too...

427
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,040
You know those things I say when
countries pop up over my shoulder ?

428
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,240
That's a reflex action.
I don't even know I'm doing it.

429
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,920
I'll show you: Germany:
where the national motto is:

430
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,200
"let's stick
to the present, shall we ?"

431
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,200
Okay, give me another one.
Luxembourg !

432
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,080
What happens when you leave
Lichtenstein out in the sun too long.

433
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,320
Okay, give me another one.
Belgium !

434
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,280
The casual acquaintance France
crops out of its Instagram photos.

435
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,520
One more.
I'm on a roll, one more.

436
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,880
Denmark: what would happen if
a suicide note was a country.

437
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,240
I don't even know I'm doing these
and I could do them all day.

438
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,760
The EU does not make
itself easy to love.

439
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,760
Its official anthem is
Beethoven's "Ode to Joy"

440
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,760
and they actually had a competition
to do a video, set to that tune.

441
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,520
You really have to see what won.

442
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,280
Fuck you.
Fuck you all forever.

443
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,640
You fuck yourself,
you go fuck yourself right now !

444
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,520
It is perfectly understandable
to be annoyed at Europe.

445
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,960
I'm barely containing
my anger right now.

446
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,400
But here is how I feel about the EU:
it's a complicated, bureaucratic,

447
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,440
ambitious, overbearing, inspirational,
consistently irritating institution

448
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,680
and Britain would be
absolutely crazy to leave it.

449
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,120
Especially because, if it stays,
it can reap all the benefits,

450
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:37,320
while still being a dick about
everything, that is the British way.

451
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,080
So, to the people of the UK,
I say this:

452
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,360
if you need your "hatred of the EU"
itch scratched, I understand.

453
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,440
Don't vote for a Brexit.
I have a better solution.

454
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,800
I'd like to retroactively
enter that EU anthem contest,

455
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,600
with a song straight out
of every British heart,

456
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:04,280
that insults Europe and acknowledges
how lost we'd be without it.

457
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,040
Please, enjoy.

458
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,800
Fuck you, European Union,

459
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,440
tally-ho, you fucking pricks.

460
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,560
We are the United Kingdom

461
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,320
you can eat our spotted dicks !

462
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:35,360
That being said, we're not going to
leave you, turns out we need you.

463
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,080
Nonetheless...

464
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:44,200
Fuck you, European Union,
it feels good to tell you this !

465
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:51,680
Poland is depressing,
and there's vampires in Romania,

466
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:59,000
Spain is far too hot
and where the fuck is Lithuania ?

467
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:06,520
To be fair, Slovenia is lovely,
we're only kidding, it sucks too,

468
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,480
but we must admit,

469
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,400
without these countries
we'd be really screwed.

470
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:21,560
Fuck the European Union,
even though we must admit

471
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:28,960
we would all be batshit crazy
if we vote for leaving it.

472
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,240
We would all be batshit crazy,

473
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,560
if we vote for leaving it.

474
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,120
That's our show !
We'll be back next week. Good night !

475
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,440
END OF EPISODE 16,
SEASON III
