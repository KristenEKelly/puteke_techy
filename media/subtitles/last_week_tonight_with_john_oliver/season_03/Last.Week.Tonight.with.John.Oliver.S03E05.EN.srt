00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,520
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,680
SEASON III
EPISODE 5

3
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,360
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !
Thank you so much for joining us.

4
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,120
I'm John Oliver.
Time for a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,160
And we begin with the US election,
or as you may know it,

6
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,120
"the holy shit, please make it stop
trash fire two thousand fuckteen."

7
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,640
This was not a great week
for either party's frontrunners.

8
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,880
And let's start with Hillary Clinton.
Who, if she is not elected president,

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,200
will take all you fuckers down
with her.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,840
She caused a little controversy
at Nancy Reagan's funeral,

11
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,760
and you might think, "how can
you get into trouble at a funeral ?"

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,000
Watch her !

13
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,440
Secretary Clinton
is now apologizing

14
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,200
for some comments
she made about Nancy Reagan.

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,840
It may be hard
for your viewers to remember

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,840
how difficult it was for people to talk
about HIV/AIDs back in the 1980s,

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,160
and because of both president
and Mrs. Reagan,

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,160
in particular Mrs. Reagan,
we started a national conversation.

19
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,320
What are you talking about ?
Nobody thinks that.

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,040
You cannot give the Reagans credit
for a "national conversation"

21
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,480
when he didn't publicly
say the word "AIDS" until 1985,

22
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,560
and didn't address the nation
about it until 1987.

23
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,480
So the Reagans started
a conversation about AIDS

24
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,240
the way many parents start
conversations with their kids about sex

25
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,360
by reluctantly mumbling
something about it existing,

26
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,920
around five years
after it became relevant.

27
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,760
And the fact Hillary Clinton
didn't know that is a little weird.

28
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,440
It's strange to forget something
so fundamental about a person.

29
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,920
It's like forgetting Cookie Monster's
thoughts on cookies

30
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,960
or Sir Mix-A-Lot's opinions
on big butts.

31
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,080
A president
is supposed to know this stuff.

32
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,920
But let's also quickly check in
with Donald Trump,

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,240
an ill-fitting suit full of chickens
coming home to roost.

34
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,000
He had a dramatic week,
culminating in this on Friday evening.

35
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,960
Chaos erupting at a rally
for Donald Trump.

36
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,320
The violence so bad,
the rally had to be cancelled.

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,240
A Trump rally being cancelled
due to violence

38
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,440
is the most predictable thing
to happen in this campaign

39
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,360
since Donald Trump
mentioning the size of his dick.

40
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,360
Of course those things happened.
Of course they did.

41
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,200
It doesn't feel like shutting down
his events is the most effective idea.

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,240
But it was hard to hear him play down
any role he may have had in this.

43
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,520
I certainly don't incite violence.
I don't condone violence.

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,400
And I don't talk about violence.

45
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,600
Obviously, you know that's a lie.
It couldn't be true,

46
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,920
even if he crossed his heart with his
tiny little AA battery-sized fingers.

47
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,360
Because there have been an escalating
series of confrontations at his rallies,

48
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,880
with his supporters
attacking protesters.

49
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,120
And where might they get
the notion that that's a good idea ?

50
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,240
Get him out of here,
throw him out.

51
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,560
If you see somebody
getting ready to throw a tomato,

52
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,000
knock the crap out of 'em.

53
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,880
You know what they used to do
to guys like that ?

54
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,320
They'd be carried out on a stretcher.

55
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,960
I'd like to punch him.

56
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,240
Strap in,
because we're in for a bumpy ride.

57
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,080
Donald Trump
is one flaming guitar player away

58
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,280
from turning the campaign trail
into fury fucking road.

59
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,280
But let's move on
to International Women's Day,

60
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,800
the day that men see the words
"International Women's Day",

61
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,080
and wonder: "Shit, do I have
to do something right now ?"

62
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,320
It took place on Tuesday.

63
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,640
Countries celebrated
with varying degrees of success.

64
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,040
In Russia, where
it's observed as a public holiday,

65
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,920
Vladimir Putin went on TV
with a message for women.

66
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,200
Dear women,

67
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,720
I wholeheartedly congratulate you
on International Women's Day.

68
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,640
You have time for everything;

69
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,280
manage a great load of issues
and stay gentle, bright and charming.

70
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,880
It's a little strange to hear
a warm message from a man

71
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,640
who looks like he's perpetually
crushing a baby bird in his fist.

72
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,520
And if he's trying to be progressive,
he's failing here...

73
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,440
"Managing a great load of issues
while staying gentle and charming"

74
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,440
is the double standard that women
are constantly trying to overcome.

75
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,160
It is great to see you're confident,
capable and career-focused.

76
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,600
And sometimes, you're not
even a shrill bitch about it !

77
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
It's very nice.

78
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,520
Meanwhile, in Turkey,
president Recep Erdogan

79
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,160
used his women's day speech
to make a point you might not expect.

80
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,040
I know there will be
some who will be annoyed,

81
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,160
but for me a woman
is above all a mother.

82
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,400
In my opinion, the greatest wrong
that you can do to a woman

83
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,360
is to restrict her to live a life

84
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,840
where she is the victim
of her economic independence.

85
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,480
Okay. First,
"a woman is above all a mother"

86
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,320
is not even appropriate
to say on Mother's Day.

87
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,120
And economic independence

88
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,160
is far from the greatest wrong
you can do to a woman.

89
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,280
There is a list that runs
from genital mutilation

90
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,960
through Nancy Meyers movies
that  you need to get through first.

91
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,480
As for China, a shopping mall there
offered discounts

92
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,720
in honor of women's day,
but "only to good-looking women,

93
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,480
after their facial appearances
were scored by a face scanner."

94
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
It's not often
you hear a news story

95
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,920
that appears to have taken place
simultaneously

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,520
in the distant future
and the distant past.

97
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,320
But, it is amazing that,
somewhere in China,

98
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,000
a TJ Maxx manager
will have uttered the phrase,

99
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,600
"The robot doesn't want to fuck you.
Those capri pants are full price."

100
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,040
At this point,
you will be glad to know,

101
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,840
that here in the US,
women marked their own day.

102
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,040
Fox News Greta Van Susteren delivered
a commentary in honor of the event.

103
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,080
But if you think you know
where it's going, you are wrong.

104
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,400
The Taliban won't let women
listen to music,

105
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,320
or leave the house
without being covered in a burka.

106
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,360
Women living under Sharia Law
endure the unthinkable,

107
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,080
simply for being women,
which brings me to this:

108
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,440
on this International Women's Day eve,
it'd be a good time for us women

109
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,600
to recognize that American men,
let's give American men a shout out.

110
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,400
Yes. Greta Van Susteren
marked International Women's Day

111
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,400
with a shout-out to American men
for being better than the Taliban.

112
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,840
I didn't even know,
I didn't even know this was possible,

113
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,960
but I am pretty sure
she just leaned out.

114
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,360
And she wasn't even done.

115
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,760
Things aren't perfect, we still
don't have equal pay for equal work.

116
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,680
But American men are by far, very
by far, the best men on the planet.

117
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,600
We may not say it,

118
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,200
but we know that, and American men
deserve to hear that from us.

119
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,160
There may be no more fitting tribute
to the state of women internationally

120
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,680
than someone giving men credit
for doing basically nothing.

121
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,920
And finally: Switzerland,

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,760
where the national dance
is collapsing from altitude sickness.

123
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,960
Last Sunday,
the Swiss observed tag der kranken.

124
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,560
Sounds like an Ikea product
which might precipitate a divorce,

125
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,560
but it's in fact
their annual "day of the sick",

126
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,120
a tradition dating back to 1939.

127
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,800
Tag der kranken
is the only Swiss tradition

128
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,240
dating back to 1939
that is not also a war crime.

129
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:59,200
The theme of this year was laughter.
And no one embraced the theme

130
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,320
more than Swiss president
Johann Schneider-Ammann,

131
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,040
who gave a speech on the subject
without cracking a smile once.

132
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,200
Dear friends, those who know
sick people, dear caregivers.

133
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,280
Laughter is good for your health,
according to a popular saying.

134
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,160
Like me, you have certainly
already had the experience.

135
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,440
Have you laughed ?

136
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,120
'Cause you have the permanent
expression of a school principal

137
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,720
telling a child his hamster
was trampled by the marching band.

138
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,160
His speech was so humorless,
one media outlet noted

139
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,160
that he was "about as funny
as a funeral director,"

140
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,880
which is unfair to funeral directors,
who tell all kinds of great jokes...

141
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,240
"Knock knock, who's there ?
We know it's not your uncle."

142
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,040
The frustrating thing is,

143
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,640
it's not difficult
to make tag der kranken funny.

144
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,640
Just look at its official logo.

145
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,960
It is supposed to be
a doctor caring for a patient,

146
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,280
but it's pretty clearly two priests
fucking on a kitchen table.

147
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,160
I assume that image beat out
their other logo designs,

148
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,440
such as "doctor leaning over
to check patient's pulse";

149
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,880
"doctor assisting a vomiting patient",
and an orgy, just an actual orgy.

150
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,320
But I'm sure the Swiss president
would see no humor in that.

151
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,320
As he seems to be very clear about
the rules of what constitutes comedy.

152
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,840
A cynical laugh with the goal
of derisively mocking a person

153
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,640
is not a good laugh, in my opinion.

154
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,480
I hate to break it to you,
Mr. President,

155
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,680
but those are the exact laughs
we are enjoying right now.

156
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,920
And I feel great about it !
And now this !

157
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,320
And now, everybody listen.
Bernie Sanders has something to say.

158
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,200
Let me just say this.

159
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,240
Let me say this
for the fourth time.

160
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,440
Let me say this.
Let me say this again.

161
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,320
Let me say this also.
Let me say this more importantly.

162
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,480
Let me tell you this...
Let me simply say this.

163
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,640
Let me say this... we...

164
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,200
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns encryption.

165
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,160
The best way to keep people
from reading your email,

166
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,120
short of making the subject line

167
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,400
"forward, forward, forward, forward,
hilarious joke from uncle Walter."

168
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,880
You may not think
about encryption much,

169
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,360
but it is fundamental to our lives.

170
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,640
Almost everything you do today
uses a code.

171
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,480
Every time you log onto an Internet
service like Twitter or Facebook

172
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,200
and send your password, every time
you log into Internet banking,

173
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,680
all of that information
is protected using encryption code.

174
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,880
That's right ! Encryption can protect
the things most important to us:

175
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,120
our financial information, health
records, dick pics, trade secrets,

176
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,120
classified government records,
dick pics, our physical location,

177
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,760
credit card information,
dick pics, and pictures of our dicks.

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,200
Lots of things have computers
in them now, even cars.

179
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,400
And last year, two hackers
showed a writer from "Wired"

180
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,200
how they could disable his car
on the interstate.

181
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,280
- Do it ! Kill the engine.
- So we're killing the engine.

182
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,320
I can't accelerate.

183
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,960
I turned on the hazard lights,
but I was still stuck in the right lane.

184
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,840
Guys, I'm stuck. On the highway.

185
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,760
I think he's panicking.

186
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,040
No shit he's panicking.
You killed his engine on the freeway.

187
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,280
They seem like they've played
so many video games

188
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,960
they've forgotten that cars are
objects carrying living people.

189
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,960
But while it can keep us safe,

190
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,160
it's important to note,
encryption also has a downside.

191
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,120
It's making it impossible
for law enforcement

192
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,440
to gain access to certain information.

193
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,880
Or, as FBI director James Comey
puts it...

194
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,360
Technology has become a tool of choice
for some very dangerous people,

195
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,520
and unfortunately, the law
has not kept pace with technology,

196
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,480
and this disconnect has created
a significant public safety problem

197
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,480
we have described
as "going dark."

198
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,720
Yes, "going dark". It's a deliberately
ominous-sounding term.

199
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,560
You wouldn't get scared if they
just called it "bad guy go bye-bye".

200
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,920
And you may have heard
about this "going dark" problem,

201
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,880
related to one particular work
iPhone belonging to Syed Farook,

202
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,040
the gunman who, with his wife,
killed 14 people last December.

203
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,000
FBI needs Apple's help, because
the security settings on the phone

204
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,880
lock the device if a password
is entered incorrectly too many times.

205
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,360
It may even erase
all the data on the phone.

206
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,720
The FBI wants Apple
to upload software

207
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,920
that lets its analysts
get around the security features

208
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,880
and take as many shots
at the passcode as necessary.

209
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,680
Yes, the FBI has a dead terrorist's
cell phone that they cannot get into.

210
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,280
It's running a newer version
of Apple's operating system,

211
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,480
that can only be accessed
by unlocking the passcode.

212
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,760
Even Apple can't get into the phone.

213
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,480
So the government is demanding
that they come up with a cheat code

214
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,280
for their top-selling iPhone game,
"Fuck, what's my passcode ?!"

215
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,600
Rated E for everyone.

216
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,920
Apple is fighting that order in court,
arguing it shouldn't be forced

217
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,800
to undermine the security features
that protect its encryption.

218
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,520
Apple leadership
risks having blood on hands.

219
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,800
How in the hell you can't access
a phone ? I just find baffling.

220
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,160
Any system
that would allow a terrorist

221
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,760
to communicate
with somebody in our country

222
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,720
and we can't find out
what they're saying is stupid.

223
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,800
That's the angriest Lindsey Graham
has been about a cell phone

224
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,960
since his name got auto-corrected
to "Linty Grandma."

225
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,440
Stupid phone. Learn my name.
I am your boss.

226
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,120
Stupid. So dumb.

227
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,920
This issue has even been
brought up on the campaign trail,

228
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,720
with predictable results...

229
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,440
What I think you oughta do
is boycott Apple

230
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,480
until such time is they give
that security number.

231
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,000
I just thought of that.
Boycott Apple !

232
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,080
I just thought of it. Give me
another one. Israel-Palestine ?

233
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,080
Make 'em wrestle in those fake
sumo costumes. Done !

234
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,080
Being president is easy !

235
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,880
This is a rare case where Trump's
outrage is almost understandable.

236
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,480
Apple's refusal to crack a terrorist's
phone can seem hard to defend.

237
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,560
Especially when,
like John Miller of the NYPD,

238
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,400
you think about it
incredibly simplistically.

239
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,000
There is no bank. There is no
safe company. There is no vault.

240
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:45,560
There is no door that can't be
penetrated with a lawful order.

241
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,240
Point taken, but was "penetrated"
the best word choice there ?

242
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,000
The government needs to be able
to penetrate you at any time.

243
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,360
If we feel you need penetration,
we have to be able to do it.

244
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,760
Quickly, and effectively
here and now.

245
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,440
Why is everyone getting
so uptight about this ?

246
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,800
It's a hugely complicated story,
with massive implications.

247
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,080
Once we get to the end, you may
not feel the same way you do now.

248
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,440
An encrypted phone is not really
like a bank, or a safe.

249
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,200
If you penetrate a safe,
you've only penetrated that safe.

250
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,240
But a code to open a phone could be
modified to open many more phones.

251
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,400
A fact that does not escape
Apple CEO Tim Cook.

252
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,320
No one, I don't believe,
would want a master key built

253
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,720
that would turn hundreds
of millions of locks.

254
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,560
Even if the key were in the possession
of the person you trust the most.

255
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,200
That key could be stolen.

256
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,320
The only way we know to
get additional information

257
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,160
is to write a piece of software that
is the software equivalent of cancer.

258
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,560
Okay, now, on one hand giving
your phone cancer sounds bad.

259
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,080
But, "The Fault In Our Stars"
would have been amazing

260
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,480
if Shailene Woodley was playing
a terminally ill iPhone 6s.

261
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
No ! I won't let you go, Hazel !
I'll hold down the power button

262
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,000
and the home button
simultaneously forever !

263
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,440
Apple hasn't been completely
uncooperative.

264
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,440
They've given FBI
information they could access,

265
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,840
Farook's iCloud backups
from six weeks before the attacks.

266
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,480
But they are refusing to create the
"cancerous" program the FBI wants.

267
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,640
They say it would take six to ten
engineers up to four weeks to do it.

268
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,560
Or, you know,
a standard genius bar appointment.

269
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,200
Apple worries that
once they make that program,

270
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,440
they can't keep it 100 percent safe.

271
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,080
FBI and its supporters can be
weirdly dismissive of that issue.

272
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,640
They either don't understand
how technology works,

273
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,200
or are pretending not to.

274
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,520
The government is asking
Tim Cook: you designed it,

275
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,320
you can design your way
out of it for this one time.

276
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,640
If you figure out the formula
and crack open this phone,

277
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,880
you can tear that formula up,
toss it in the fireplace and throw it.

278
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:14,200
You know Apple is not writing its code
on paper, next to a fireplace.

279
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,200
They're a cutting-edge technology
company, not Lord Grantham.

280
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,000
As for the notion Apple can throw
the formula after FBI uses it once,

281
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,960
nobody seriously thinks
that is going to happen.

282
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,720
Apple says if it complies,
requests from law enforcement

283
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,600
could come for another phone,
opening a Pandora's box.

284
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,040
Manhattan district attorney says
he has 175 iPhones

285
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,720
with potential evidence
from serious crimes,

286
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
including murder, he cannot open.

287
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,920
Exactly. There are over 175 other
phones in line, just in New York.

288
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,880
This is bound to set a precedent.
Think of the government as your dad,

289
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,440
if he asks you to help him
with his iPhone, be careful.

290
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,280
If you do it once, you're
going to be doing it 14 times a day.

291
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,800
Whatever happens in this case
will have ramifications.

292
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,360
FBI ultimately wants Apple
and the entire tech industry

293
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,960
to have its encryption always
be weak enough

294
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,960
that a company can access customers'
data if law enforcement needs it.

295
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,720
So it might be the iPhone today
and an Android phone tomorrow

296
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,920
and a Blackberry the day after that.

297
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,960
Assuming that the day after that
is in 1998.

298
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,680
You might be wondering:
but look if there's a warrant,

299
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,760
do these companies
have a choice ?

300
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,840
The answer, surprisingly,
might be: "Yes, they do."

301
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,040
The government is currently
citing the all writs act of 1789,

302
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,800
which mandates you must
cooperate with investigators.

303
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,120
But courts are split over whether
it applies in cases like these.

304
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,240
And there's not really any more
recent law covering this area.

305
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,160
We've been down this road before.

306
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,760
The government grappled
with encryption two decades ago

307
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,240
and in the 90s, they came up with what
they thought would be ideal solution:

308
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,040
Government will press companies
to use a so-called clipper chip

309
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,040
which would allow authorities
to monitor coded messages.

310
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,160
That clipper chip
was theoretically perfect:

311
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,320
your information could be encrypted,
the government would have access.

312
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,240
Like giving your house key to a trusted
neighbor. You can trust Mike.

313
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,640
He's only going to try on your
underwear if it's absolutely necessary.

314
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,360
One problem: a computer scientist
and hacker named Matt Blaze

315
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,440
figured out a way to disable the
government-access feature of the chip

316
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,920
and the project
was eventually abandoned.

317
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,760
And by the way: is there
a more 90s series of words

318
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,160
than "a hacker named Matt Blaze ?"

319
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,360
It's got to be right up there
with "Talk to the hand, Furby"

320
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,240
and "Grammy award winners,
Milli Vanilli."

321
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,520
But thanks to the clipper chip fiasco
and pressure from tech companies

322
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,720
the government backed off,
abandoning the push for a backdoor.

323
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,880
Decades later, they seem to have
convinced themselves it can be done.

324
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,800
Apple's capabilities are remarkable
when it is their desire.

325
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,800
Silicon Valley is full of great people,
who when they were younger,

326
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,120
were told your dreams are too hard,
thank goodness they didn't listen.

327
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,960
I hate to hear talk like
"that cannot be done",

328
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,920
think about if Jack Kennedy said
we cannot go to the moon.

329
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,200
He said we're going
to get there in the next decade.

330
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,760
I love that optimism.
There are lots of things we can't do,

331
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,880
even though
we've been to the moon.

332
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,000
We are yet to master time travel
or figure out why Hulk Hogan

333
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,840
dresses for court like a pallbearer
at a boa constrictor's funeral.

334
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,520
Those still
elude human understanding.

335
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,840
The government's faith in Apple's
powers is the company's own fault.

336
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,240
Their ads have linked
them to Einstein and Gandhi,

337
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,720
and they sell the most mundane aspects
of their products as world-changers.

338
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,160
This is iPhone 6S.
Not much has changed,

339
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,040
except it responds to
the pressure of your finger.

340
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,760
Now you can change apps like this.
Pay at more places like this.

341
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,560
And the new color.
It's rose gold, it's awesome.

342
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,880
No, it is not.

343
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,200
Looks like someone vomited a salmon
dinner onto dirty ballet shoes.

344
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,200
But ads like those obscure
the real truth about Apple,

345
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,360
which is that beneath their shiny,
Rose Gold surface,

346
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,000
they are incredibly
susceptible to hackers,

347
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,560
who are constantly finding
flaws in their security features.

348
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,440
You can buy boxes like this one
on eBay that can hack you

349
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,840
into an iPhone running some
versions of iOS 8 or lower.

350
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,080
Just watch this YouTube video
showing you how they work.

351
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,360
You attach the wire to the screen,
adjust a few settings,

352
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,960
let it cycle through passcodes
and eventually, you are in.

353
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,320
Apple, understandably, do not
want us thinking too much about that.

354
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,880
"Scary security flaws" is one
of those three-word phrases

355
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,200
they hate to be associated with,
like "corporate tax avoidance"

356
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,160
or "factory suicide nets."

357
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:24,360
When Apple argues that if it's forced
to have access to its customers' data,

358
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,520
it can't 100% guarantee its safety,
most computer scientists agree.

359
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,440
Or, as Matt Blaze, the guy
who hacked the clipper chip put it:

360
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,640
When I hear the, if we can put
a man on the moon we can do this,

361
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,520
I'm hearing an analogy
almost as if we're saying:

362
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,600
if we can put a man on the moon,
we can put a man on the sun.

363
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,200
That is a rational scientific view.

364
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,520
Just because a man
can walk on the moon

365
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,400
does not mean he might
as well be walking on the sun,

366
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,400
a point summarized recently in the
New England Journal of Smashmouth.

367
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,360
For the sake of argument,

368
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,280
let's assume Apple could have access
to your encrypted data,

369
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,240
repeatedly help law enforcement
and always keep the bad guys out

370
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,760
which, again, is widely thought
by experts to be impossible.

371
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,880
That still won't solve
the FBI's "going dark" problem.

372
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,040
If you really want to keep
your communications secret,

373
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,560
there's an app for that.

374
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,080
The encryption debate is good
business for one startup.

375
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,040
Telegram, a messaging app that
encrypts messages

376
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,520
has surpassed 100 million users.

377
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,480
That's the point: people who want
encryption will be able to find it.

378
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:40,040
It could be one of the more than
800 other encryption products,

379
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,640
almost two thirds of which are made
by companies not covered by US law.

380
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:50,040
Like Silent Phone, or Threema,
or Snikkity-Snak, or Mailgrub.

381
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,520
Now granted,
those last two aren't real,

382
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,320
but they will be in five minutes

383
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,200
if the government forces the other
ones to weaken their encryption.

384
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,600
That might not be the only
consequence of the FBI's actions.

385
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,680
Many countries, including Russia
and China are watching this debate

386
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,400
and will presumably
expect similar access.

387
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,320
Russia and China have
as much respect for privacy

388
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,120
as horny teenagers
in 80's comedies.

389
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,440
When you consider the legal
tenuousness of the FBIs case,

390
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,760
the borderline impossibility
of perfectly securing the key,

391
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,840
the international fallout
of creating a precedent

392
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:37,480
and that a terrorist could circumvent
of this by downloading Threema,

393
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,960
it's enough to sway
the most strident opinion.

394
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,400
Remember Lindsey Graham ?
Mister "this is stupid" ?

395
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:52,200
Just this week, he was in a hearing
with Attorney General Loretta Lynch,

396
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,280
and this happened:

397
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,440
For us, the issue is about a criminal
investigation into a terrorist act

398
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,560
and the need to obtain evidence.

399
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,200
It's just not so simple
and I'll end with this:

400
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,480
I thought it was that simple
until I started getting briefed

401
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,240
by people in the Intel community,
I'm a person who's been moved

402
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,920
by the arguments
and the precedent we set,

403
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,360
and the damage we may be doing
to our own national security.

404
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,440
It's a miracle. Lindsey Graham
has met the concept of nuance.

405
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,240
And this is a man
who once warned:

406
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,680
"the world
is literally about to blow up."

407
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,480
So you're not dealing with someone
who likes to dabble with grey areas.

408
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,560
There is no easy side to be on
in this debate.

409
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,360
Strong encryption has its costs,
from protecting terrorists

410
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,720
to drug dealers to child
pornographers.

411
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,120
But I happen to feel that
the risks of weakening encryption,

412
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,560
even just for the government,
are potentially much worse.

413
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,120
Even though
I'm on Apple's side in this case,

414
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,560
they would help both their customers
and the government understand this,

415
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,240
if they were a little more honest
regarding security in their ads.

416
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,280
Hi. We're Apple. This is an
iPhone. It comes in rose gold.

417
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,160
This is an Apple customer.

418
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,920
Siri ! Find vegan sushi.

419
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,800
Sounds good. And these are the
engineers who make our products.

420
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,880
We can help you communicate,
celebrate, pay for stuff. Everything.

421
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:26,200
We're one step ahead of hackers,
so that when lose your phone,

422
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,840
your information doesn't wind up
in the hands of guys like Gary.

423
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,640
I'm Gary. Thanks for
losing your phone, dipshit.

424
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,600
If Gary can get in, he has
access to pictures of your food,

425
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,560
your bank account, everything.

426
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,280
Now I can masturbate
to photos of your family !

427
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,000
And when we find out there's
a security flaw, this is how we react.

428
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,600
Fuck !

429
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,280
Yeah, that's about right.

430
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,680
So when the FBI asks if we can
undermine our encryption

431
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,120
without compromising emails, texts
and videos, this is our response.

432
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,000
Are you kidding ?
We're engineers, not wizards !

433
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,040
- Are you sure you're not wizards ?
- Yeah, pretty sure ! Fuck !

434
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,680
Apple's not perfect.
You need proof ? We made the Newton.

435
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,400
We made that one Mac
that looks like a toaster.

436
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,520
We thought
the Apple Watch was cool.

437
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,640
- This isn't cool ?
- No.

438
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,800
Shit !

439
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,560
We put a U2 album on your phones
you've been struggling to delete.

440
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,480
That thing keeps coming back ?

441
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:27,200
We can't even make our battery last
more than, like, a day. Why is that ?

442
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,360
You tried turning of location
services and push emails

443
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,800
and adjusting your screen
brightness...

444
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,080
Okay, forget we asked.
The point is, best case scenario,

445
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:40,040
we can keep hackers out of your stuff
for 6 months before this happens.

446
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,520
I'm back.
I see someone's been to the beach.

447
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,200
So keep enjoying our products,

448
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,440
just know this shaky edifice
could crumble at any moment.

449
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,760
Apple: join us as we dance
madly on the lip of the volcano.

450
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,600
That's our show ! Thanks for watching,
see you next week, good night !

451
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,400
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

452
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,080
END OF EPISODE 5,
SEASON III
