LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,480
SEASON III
EPISODE 12

3
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,440
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,760
Thank you so much for joining us.
Just time for a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,280
And we begin with Donald Trump.
Rome burning in man-form.

6
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,200
On Thursday, he went
to the RNC headquarters in Washington

7
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,840
to meet with Paul Ryan
to try and mend fences.

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,000
Ryan had famously declined
to endorse Trump,

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,320
but after the meeting,
he struck a more conciliatory tone.

10
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,120
I was very encouraged with what
I heard from Donald Trump today.

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,680
I do believe that,
that we are now planting the seeds

12
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,080
to get ourselves unified
to bridge the gaps and differences.

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,000
He was a very good personality.
He's a very warm and genuine person.

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,720
Okay, stop !

15
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,280
I understand the "genuine" part

16
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,600
in the same way
that Miller Genuine Draft is genuine.

17
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,480
Is the shitty thing that it is.

18
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,800
But, but the only way Trump
could be described as "warm"

19
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,880
is if you're feeling leftover tanning
bed heat radiating from his skin.

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,600
And why is Paul Ryan
being so coy about this ?

21
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,560
We all know where this is going.
Trump needs the GOP's money,

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,720
because he's decided he is not
self-funding his election campaign.

23
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,040
And the republicans need
to not alienate Trump's voters.

24
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,520
Trump and the republican establishment
are like a teenage Christian couple

25
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,560
who've made an abstinence pledge.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,800
They are going to have sex.
It is just a matter of time.

27
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,800
They make a show of resisting it for
anyone who might be paying attention.

28
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,120
However, the rest of the week
was a little bumpier for Trump.

29
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,240
On Friday morning, he attempted to
justify not releasing his tax returns,

30
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,080
and it did not go great.

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,240
Many presidents
din not show their tax returns.

32
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,360
Every single nominee since 1976
has released their tax returns.

33
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,000
Before 1976,
people didn't do it.

34
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,920
Yeah, sure.

35
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,560
But there were a lot of things we did
before 1976 that seem crazy now.

36
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,320
Like smoking on airplanes,

37
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,480
and thinking Elliott Gould
was a major sex symbol.

38
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,200
The point is, times have changed.

39
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,680
But the weirdest thing involving Trump
this week was the release of tapes

40
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,800
suggesting that, in the nineties,
he had for some reason

41
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,800
invented a publicist for himself
named John Miller,

42
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,360
and pretended to be him
on the phone.

43
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,480
- I'm sort of new here.
- What is your position there ?

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,840
I'm of handling PR
he gets so much of it.

45
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,880
- Where did you come from ?
- I worked for different firms.

46
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,800
I'm somebody that he knows and I think
somebody that he trusts and likes.

47
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,200
That is so perfectly Donald Trump.

48
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,640
Even his imaginary alter ego
reflexively brags about himself.

49
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,040
Now, on that tape,
you hear "John Miller"

50
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,560
saying many incredible things
about Trump

51
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,560
including claiming that Madonna
wanted to date him.

52
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,600
She called and she wanted
to go out with him.

53
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,960
The people you write about are...

54
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,920
They call actresses...

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,760
People call to see
if they can go out with him.

56
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,800
Now much like his candidacy,
that claim is sad, but not implausible.

57
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,840
Remember: there were rumors
that, in the nineties,

58
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,280
Madonna got together with Vanilla Ice,
Jose Canseco and Willem Dafoe.

59
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,160
What is Donald Trump if not a mixture
of the authenticity of Vanilla Ice,

60
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,640
the likability of Jose Canseco,

61
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,840
and the terrifying facial expressions
of Willem Dafoe ?

62
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,720
But, this shouldn't
even have been news this week !

63
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,440
Back when this happened, Trump
confessed to the whole thing.

64
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,200
Trump admitted that he was John Miller
and called it a joke gone awry.

65
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,960
So there's no story here, then,
is there ?

66
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,640
All present-day Trump needed to do
was re-confirm that it was him.

67
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,560
The simple question this morning,
are you aware of the tape ? Is it you ?

68
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,360
I don't know anything about it.

69
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,760
You're telling me about it
and it doesn't sound like my voice.

70
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,760
Yes it does ! It's clearly you !
There is only one way to settle this.

71
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,120
I would like to extend an invitation
to John Miller, publicist,

72
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,800
to appear on this program.

73
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,920
Now to be clear: this is not
an invitation to Donald Trump,

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,160
who, who has never, and will never,
be invited here for an interview.

75
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,160
But if John Miller wants to come,
we would love to have him.

76
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,240
We've even set up
our interview area for you

77
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,640
with all the things
that we presume John Miller enjoys

78
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,880
overcooked steaks,
low-grade pornographic magazines,

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,160
and a hand mirror.

80
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,880
It's an open invitation !
So please, come on by, John Miller !

81
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,560
There's nothing stopping you,
other than the fact you don't exist.

82
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,080
Let's move on for now
to queen Elizabeth II.

83
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,160
The only becrowned woman
who acts more entitled

84
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,480
than a bride
at her bachelorette party.

85
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,800
"This is my day ! It's my day
before my 'other' day !"

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,200
When the queen makes headlines,
it's because she's just gotten older.

87
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,880
Her most meaningful power as monarch
is basically to stand there

88
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,040
and experience the passage of time.

89
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,800
But at a garden party, she made
news with an overheard complaint.

90
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,000
The queen has been caught on camera
criticizing a Chinese delegation to UK.

91
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,840
Her majesty was introduced
to a police commander

92
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,160
who described difficulties during the
state visit of the Chinese president.

93
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,480
Can I present
commander Lucy D'Orsi,

94
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,320
gold commander
when the Chinese state visit.

95
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,160
Bad luck. They were very rude
to the ambassador.

96
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,600
They were rude to the ambassador !

97
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,320
I will say: it's kind of refreshing
to hear a 90-year-old woman

98
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,280
air a grievance
with specific Chinese individuals

99
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,360
rather than expressing a vague distrust
for Chinese people in general.

100
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,480
But this story became a big deal,
with experts even delving

101
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,480
into the physics of how
the queen had been overheard.

102
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,960
Sometimes you hear the royals,
sometimes you don't.

103
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,600
There seems to have been
a sort of perfect storm yesterday.

104
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,800
The queen was under a plastic umbrella,
which acted to amplify her words.

105
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,360
Of course, the classic problem
of unintended sound amplification.

106
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,040
We haven't heard this much
from the queen since she had surgery.

107
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,800
But other people
were more interested

108
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,640
in examining
why the queen was so upset.

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,240
In the queen's defense,
she is only saying

110
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,280
the police officer is saying
what was widely reported,

111
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,800
which was Chinese officials and
Chinese security at the embassy

112
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,840
were pretty high-handed
in the way they were treating

113
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,000
British police, British diplomats,

114
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,840
acting, in the words of one observer,
as if they owned the place.

115
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,440
That is a little rich
coming from an English person,

116
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,960
because for about 300 years, that
was Britain's entire military policy.

117
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,640
"How should we engage
the enemy, sir ?"

118
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,760
"I suppose we'll march in
and act like we own the place."

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And finally this week: Budweiser.

120
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,640
America's favorite
liquid yeast infection.

121
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,600
They decided to make
a branding change, and surprisingly,

122
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,040
it wasn't making their product taste
less like minion jizz.

123
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,080
It was something far less expected.

124
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,040
This summer, Budweiser
is renaming its beer "America":

125
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,000
new labels and images
associated with the U.S.

126
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,800
It's true, for six months,
Budweiser will be called "America".

127
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,000
So now, people can finally say,

128
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,360
"Sorry, I vomited America all over
the men's room of a Ruby Tuesday's."

129
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,760
It is self-serving for Budweiser
to wrap the US flag around their cans

130
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,680
of what's left in the dishwasher
after you accidentally wash beans.

131
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,680
Especially when you consider
this one tiny detail.

132
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,800
Budweiser, by the way,
is brewed in St. Louis,

133
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,240
but it is owned
by a company in Belgium.

134
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,920
Yes, Budweiser's parent company
is based in Belgium.

135
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,520
Though Belgium does have one thing
in common with Budweiser:

136
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,480
Germans refuse to acknowledge
that it's even there.

137
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,760
But one proud American has stepped
forward to claim credit for the change.

138
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,440
You will almost certainly guess who.

139
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
Donald Trump,
you had something to do

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,560
with Budweiser changing their name
of the beer for this summer ?

141
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,360
They're so impressed
with what our country will become,

142
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,960
that they decided
to do this before the fact.

143
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,440
They got to get a taste.

144
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,240
That actually makes sense. Because
Budweiser beer is a lot like Trump.

145
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,800
They're both known for their
terrible taste and frothy heads,

146
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,320
they're both the color of burnt urine,
and every once in a while,

147
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,840
they both seem to change their name
for no reason whatsoever.

148
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,520
And now, this !

149
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,080
Elected officials,
at the local, state or federal level,

150
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,680
these are the men and women

151
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,760
who make us look like fucking idiots
for electing them.

152
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,840
Let's meet one, in our ongoing series
"People Who Somehow Got Elected".

153
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,800
This week's person,
Paul LePage, governor of Maine,

154
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,840
the state that has been overseeing a
non-stop lobster genocide since 1820.

155
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,160
Since coming to power 5 years ago,

156
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,080
brash Tea Party
backed conservative Paul LePage

157
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,560
has been busy, mostly fighting
with the state's legislature,

158
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,240
to which he's issued a record number
of vetoes, over 400 and counting.

159
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,280
But he's best known
for the unusual things he says,

160
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,920
like these remarks about drug dealers
many took to be racist.

161
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,800
These are guys that are named
D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty,

162
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,360
these type of guys that come
from Connecticut and New York.

163
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,360
No self-respecting drug dealer
has ever called himself Smoothie.

164
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,560
And second, we haven't even got
to the racist part yet.

165
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,360
Half the time they impregnate
a young, white girl before they leave.

166
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
There it is ! And LePage
later offered a recommendation

167
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,080
for how Maine's gun owners
could combat the drug trade.

168
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,200
Everybody in Maine,
we have constitutional carry,

169
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,440
load up
and get rid of the drug dealers.

170
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,880
Encouraging vigilantes
to mow down criminals

171
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,600
isn't an enforcement strategy,
it's the plot of Death Wish 3.

172
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,760
But for people who live in Maine,
these statements are not surprising.

173
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,360
While most humans possess
a thin barrier that stops thoughts

174
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,120
from immediately exiting
their brain as words,

175
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,760
Paul LePage does not.

176
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,760
Like when he sent a message
to the NAACP...

177
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,200
Come and kiss my butt.

178
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,400
Or complained about
immigrant workers in his state.

179
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,520
What's the special today
from somebody from Bulgaria ?

180
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,520
The worst one
is if they're from India.

181
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,640
Or describe the diseases he thinks
refugees would bring to Maine.

182
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:31,080
What happens is you get Hepatitis C,
Tuberculosis, AIDS, HIV,

183
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,080
the Ziki fly...

184
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,920
And here, LePage is wrong,
because Ziki fly populations

185
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,960
have decreased in Maine
in recent years,

186
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,920
owing to the fact that Ziki flies
are not a real thing and do not exist.

187
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,440
LePage saves his finest remarks
for his opponents,

188
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,400
like when he criticized a lawmaker
in the most graphic possible terms.

189
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,280
Senator Jackson
claims to be for the people.

190
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,760
But he's the first one to give it to
the people without providing Vaseline.

191
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,880
That's right, he implied
former state senator Troy Jackson

192
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,360
was subjecting Mainers
to an unlubricated fucking, but...

193
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,960
Shit, he's coming back
to say something else.

194
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,800
Listen, dammit !

195
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,400
That comment
is not politically correct,

196
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,720
but we gotta understand:
this man is a bad person.

197
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,000
As a result
of his mouth forming words,

198
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,960
Paul LePage is in a near
constant state of apology.

199
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,800
Governor LePage is apologizing.

200
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,080
Governor Paul LePage met with Jewish
community leaders to apologize again.

201
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,400
I do apologize for offending anyone.
Particularly the loggers.

202
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,160
I apologize
to all the Maine women.

203
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,240
Governor LePage apologizing
to the son of a political cartoonist.

204
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,040
LePage sent Nick Danby
a hand-written letter

205
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,840
apologizing for joking that he wanted
to shoot Danby's father.

206
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,760
A weird letter to receive.

207
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,080
Sorry I said I wanted to shoot
your dad, love, the governor.

208
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,240
Yet he insists there's a rational
explanation for everything he's said.

209
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,840
I'm sorry, I am not like you guys.

210
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,880
I am not polished speaker,
but I have a heart.

211
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,680
You can take the kid off the street,
but not viceversa.

212
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,560
I may not be very articulate
because I came from the streets.

213
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,800
Squeezing a toy pig doesn't prove
you're from the streets,

214
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,400
it proves you're a 3-year-old boy
named Toby.

215
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,320
He's not one of those politicians who
will think one thing and say another,

216
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,400
he'll tell you what's on his mind,
no matter how horrifying it is.

217
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,960
And that is why Paul LePage
is, incredibly,

218
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,280
a person
who somehow got elected.

219
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:51,560
Moving on ! Our main story tonight
concerns 911.

220
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,360
The thing you call right after
WebMD tells you

221
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,200
you're not going to be able
to get it out on your own.

222
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,200
911 is a number so important, we do
everything to make kids remember it

223
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,000
from classroom posters,
to toy phones,

224
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,800
to folksy PSA's
produced by local firehouses.

225
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,760
Hi, Mrs. Clark,
welcome to station four.

226
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,480
So who knows when to call 911 ?

227
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,080
You should call 911 if a person is
badly hurt or in danger, right now.

228
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,160
If you're not sure
whether it's a real emergency,

229
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,160
and there are no adults around,
make the call.

230
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,760
That's true. But sometimes, you
should call even if adults are around.

231
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,520
If someone's dying and the only
adult is Matthew McConaughey,

232
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,160
maybe don't leave
the decision to him.

233
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,720
"You bleedin' out there, hoss ?
Let's get some bongo drums"

234
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,240
"and herbal love and tell that
open wound to come together."

235
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,800
"We got it done."

236
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,400
We make roughly 240 million
911 calls each year,

237
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,040
dispatchers do amazing work
talking people through childbirth,

238
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,640
CPR, abductions
and home break-ins.

239
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,000
We're so accustomed
to relying on them,

240
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,560
we even call
when we don't have an emergency.

241
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,720
- 911, where's your emergency ?
- Are the fireworks still on ?

242
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,640
- You cannot call 911 for that.
- Thank you.

243
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,280
I'm having an overdose and so's my
wife. We made brownies.

244
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,000
And I think we're dead.
Time is going by really slow.

245
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:23,120
I have a baby lizard in my house
and he crawled in my printer.

246
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,880
- The baby crawled in your printer ?
- No, a baby lizard.

247
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,840
- Where is your emergency ?
- I'm on the toilet !

248
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,880
That's a little boy named Richie.

249
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,960
- I'm done ! Potty.
- You're done potty. Okay.

250
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,000
I know that sounds adorable,

251
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,400
but that kid may've caused such a mess
he had to call 911.

252
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:51,160
"This is Richie. You guys have some
sort of emergency cleanup crew ?"

253
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,280
"I am done going potty."

254
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,000
We have a lot of faith in 911,

255
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,840
but the system can break down
more than you think.

256
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,120
When it does,
people can die as a result.

257
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,480
Shanell Anderson was delivering
newspapers in the dark

258
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,600
when she careened
into this pond.

259
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,440
She knew right where she was.

260
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,200
- The Fairway and Batesville.
- Batesville and what ?

261
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,800
- The Fairway is the street, ma'am.
- Fairway ? I don't have that.

262
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,720
But 911 dispatchers
can't find her on their map.

263
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,760
It took first responders
20 minutes to get to her.

264
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,960
She died because a system we expect
to save our lives failed her.

265
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,200
And 911 losing valuable time,

266
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,520
because dispatchers can't determine
your location, is not unusual.

267
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:47,600
Improving location accuracy
could save 10 000 lives a year.

268
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,640
Which seems like a worthwhile goal.
People making emergency calls

269
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,600
are on the short list of things we
expect to be found 100% of the time.

270
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,040
It's that, the clitoris and Nemo.

271
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,040
He's not a bad fish,
he's just curious

272
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,320
and he's capable
of more than you think !

273
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,120
And the obstacles for 911 centers
don't stop there,

274
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:15,000
they may be underfunded, understaffed
and full of outdated technology.

275
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,440
Which is fine if you're describing
a Radio Shack,

276
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,560
but it's scary when it's a place that
handles life and death situations.

277
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,280
So tonight, let's focus on how
on earth we got to this point.

278
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,240
The location problems
have a lot to do with the fact

279
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,240
that 70 to 80 percent of all 911 calls
now come from cell phones.

280
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,720
And that's become a problem.
When everyone used landlines,

281
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,200
they could simply match
the call to your billing address.

282
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,800
But now, you could be anywhere.
Unless, of course, you have AT&T,

283
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,960
because then you can only get
reception standing by your window,

284
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,960
as long as it's not cloudy.

285
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,120
While 911 centers do get some
location info from wireless carriers,

286
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,600
it varies wildly.

287
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,480
They might only get the cell
tower your call was routed through.

288
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,960
And that's why, around the country,
your chance of them quickly find you

289
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,680
ranges from as low as ten percent
to as high as 95 percent.

290
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,080
Watch one reporter put a dispatch
center in Virginia to the test.

291
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,640
911, where is your emergency ?

292
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,160
This is Jeff Rossen with NBC News,
want to know if you can tell me

293
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,600
where our location
is on your computer.

294
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,000
- Showing 4641 West Ox Road.
- That's not here.

295
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,080
Absolutely not.
That's about a quarter mile away.

296
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,840
And we're standing in the actual
911 center. That's it down there.

297
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,080
That is not good.
You never want to be in a situation

298
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,920
where you have to tell someone:
"I'm actually inside you right now."

299
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,440
If you're thinking:
"Hold on, wait a minute,"

300
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,600
"I can find my location
on my cell phone."

301
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,840
You're not alone.
Dispatchers wonder the same thing.

302
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,640
I can check in on Facebook and
it'll tell you what building I'm in,

303
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,480
I can be at the hockey game and it
tells me I'm at First Niagara Center,

304
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,560
but when you call 911 we don't get
that accurate location information.

305
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,720
Technology's out there,
it's not getting to us at this point.

306
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,120
That's a good point. 'Cause even the
Domino's app can tell where you are

307
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,040
and they've barely mastered the
technology to make a palatable pizza.

308
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,000
So we asked everyone, from the FCC
to public safety groups,

309
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,960
about why it seems Ubers can find
you better than ambulances can.

310
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,680
There doesn't seem to be
a simple, satisfying answer.

311
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,080
Broadly, services like Uber aren't
always 100 percent accurate,

312
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
particularly in rural areas.

313
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,560
Emergency workers would
like technology that can tell them

314
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,040
what floor you're on and no one seems
to know how to do that yet.

315
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,240
The wireless industry
does claim to be working toward

316
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,120
incorporating some of what Uber
uses into 911 location services,

317
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,760
it seems there is no guarantee when
that'll be ready for widespread use.

318
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:02,800
The FCC has mandated they improve
accuracy, so that by 2021,

319
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,080
carriers deliver a usable location
for callers 80 percent of the time.

320
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,320
Which sounds impressive,
until you put it like this:

321
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,200
Six years from now,

322
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:17,280
911 could still be unable to find one
out of every five emergency callers.

323
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:23,760
"In six years, I might not be able
to find one out of five of you"

324
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,680
is only acceptable if you're speaking
to the members of One Direction.

325
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,080
I'm sorry, Niall. But one of you
has to be the J.C. Chasez.

326
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,520
Fixing the location problem
won't fix everything.

327
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,680
911 is so fragmented, there are
currently 5 899 dispatch centers,

328
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,520
because each county or municipality
might have its own one.

329
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,000
There is no guarantee that
any two dispatch centers

330
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,280
use the same technology
or have a system to work together.

331
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,880
In six states, there is no
specific statewide entity

332
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,880
in charge
of coordinating 911 services.

333
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,160
While Georgia law does require
a committee to help develop plans,

334
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,760
it's not exactly a robust body.

335
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,160
This is it. Georgia's permanent
911 advisory committee.

336
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,920
You'll notice all 15 seats are empty.

337
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,960
There's no one at the mic
and there's nothing on the agenda.

338
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,360
This committee hasn't met for years,

339
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,320
because there isn't a single
member currently appointed.

340
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,920
How is that possible ?

341
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,640
A spokesperson claimed that that
committee does have members.

342
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,120
And didn't answer when we asked
for those members' names.

343
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,280
You could at least make up a name
like John Miller,

344
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,000
right off the top of your head,
it's clearly not hard.

345
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,120
And there is a lot that
that committee could be doing.

346
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,280
The federal government has been
talking about Next Generation 911.

347
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,800
Upgrading dispatch centers
to an IP based network

348
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,640
and enabling them to do things
like accept videos and text messages.

349
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,840
Could be life saving in situations
where you can't make a phone call,

350
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,520
like domestic violence or having
a heart attack in a library.

351
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,960
Get some help, but have some
respect for the other patrons.

352
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:23,040
But as of right now, no state has
fully implemented Next Gen 911.

353
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,800
This would make everything
so much easier for the dispatchers

354
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,400
whose jobs are hard enough already.

355
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,080
Some days, depending upon
the outcome, it's good.

356
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,040
Other days, not.

357
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,720
Sometimes, you really
don't know the outcome,

358
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,160
and you go home at night
and you wonder,

359
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,800
I could've prevented this person from
dying or this from getting hurt ?

360
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,520
And then there are other times
when you might save a life,

361
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,480
that you go home and
you pat yourself on the back

362
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,520
and you're saying to yourself:
I did something really good.

363
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:05,120
That is a wider extreme than most
of us experience in our daily jobs.

364
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,160
For me, is whether there's hazelnut
creamer in the break room

365
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,120
or whether Janice from
accounting drank it all again.

366
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,680
That's not even milk.
That's disgusting.

367
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,240
And that level of stress,
combined with funding shortages,

368
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,000
has caused dispatch centers
to be understaffed.

369
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:30,080
Go to Google, put in "understaffed
911 dispatch" and your town

370
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,720
and see what comes up.

371
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,640
In many places,
it will be headlines like these.

372
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,440
These are one of those things
a ridiculous number of cities have,

373
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,880
like a Chinatown
or a statue of someone racist.

374
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,080
If your local dispatch center
is understaffed,

375
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,520
when you call, the first voice
you hear may be this:

376
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,280
You have reached
Memphis 911 emergency.

377
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,840
All operators are busy,
remain on the line.

378
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,600
Cincinnati 911 center. Your call will
be answered as soon as possible.

379
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:07,360
New Hanover County 911.
We have high volumes of calls.

380
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,520
You have reached 911 emergency
dispatch. Do not hang up.

381
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,920
If in danger, lay down
the phone and go to safety.

382
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,320
"Go to safety."
Why didn't I think of that ?

383
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,600
Here I am in danger, when really,
I could simply be going to safety !

384
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,960
I shouldn't have wasted
your time by calling.

385
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,440
Some of that call volume is on us.
The ubiquity of cell phones means,

386
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,160
if 50 people see a fire,
911 might get 50 calls.

387
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,360
And that's on top of an even
bigger strain on the system.

388
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:45,040
84 million 911 calls a year
nationwide are butt dials.

389
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,560
One person even butt
dialed 911 136 times.

390
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,960
When you receive a call
and it's from,

391
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,240
as we call the butt dial,
there's not a lot you can do.

392
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,000
When I tell that I butt dialed them,
they sound kind of aggravated.

393
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,440
It's kind of a waste
of their time, you know ?

394
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,240
Like, okay, make sure
you don't call again.

395
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,600
I bet that guy
hears the same response

396
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,000
from anyone he dials
by accident or on purpose.

397
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,360
We have an antiquated,
disjointed system,

398
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,400
populated by workers who are
sick of listening to people's butts.

399
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:28,680
Almost everyone's phone bill
has a line like this on it,

400
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,120
which you might assume goes
to fund 911 centers.

401
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,800
The FCC's fee report show
that, since 2008,

402
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,400
at least 20 states
diverted those dollars elsewhere.

403
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,480
Which is probably why,
depending on where you live,

404
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,680
911 may be a joke in your town,
to quote Duran Duran.

405
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:53,280
It's a Public Enemy song. Did you know
that Duran Duran covered it ?

406
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:09,720
You're welcome, you haven't heard
that disaffected anthem properly

407
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,240
until you've heard it performed
by Simon from Hertfordshire.

408
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,200
We are routinely raiding 911
to pay for other things.

409
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,600
New York state, which has seen
multiple breakdowns in its system,

410
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,680
took in over $185 million
in fees in 2014,

411
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,000
but diverted $77 million
into the state's general fund,

412
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,840
where it could be spent
on pretty much anything.

413
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,520
When the governor was asked,
he blew it off.

414
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,080
Is that something in the budget
process you'll take a look at ?

415
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,280
Is it right for us
to divert this money ?

416
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,760
It is not an issue that has come up,

417
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,240
I haven't heard any legislator raise
it. If it comes up, we'll look into it.

418
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,320
A, it just fucking came up.

419
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,000
B, legislators have raised the issue
since you've been in office

420
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,680
and C, not diverting money
away from 911

421
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,080
is one of those things you shouldn't
have to be told not to do.

422
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,760
Like siphoning gas out of a fire
truck to put into your dirt bike.

423
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:14,320
"No one's told me this is wrong.
I'm gonna go spin some donuts."

424
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,160
This blasé attitude
is indicative of the fact that,

425
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,640
until we're confronted
with the challenges facing 911,

426
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,560
it seems we're not going
to do anything about them.

427
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,360
We are taught from a young age
to take 911 for granted,

428
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,840
so perhaps
it's time for that to change.

429
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,760
You should call 911 if a person
is badly hurt or in danger.

430
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,960
Any questions ? Yeah.

431
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,880
If I call 911,
you'll come and help me ?

432
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,200
I'm sure gonna try, sweetie.
If you're calling from a cellphone

433
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,920
and you don't know your address,
we're gonna struggle to find you.

434
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,240
- That's scary.
- Don't you worry.

435
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,960
By the year 2021,
we will find you every time.

436
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,760
Four out of five times.

437
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,920
How can you not know
how to find me ?

438
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,720
I can order pizza from my phone
and they know where I am.

439
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,320
- It's not the same thing.
- There's a pizza on its way.

440
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,480
I'm gonna get a dispatcher to
come explain this to you.

441
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:25,320
Bill said you had questions about why
we cannot find you all the time.

442
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,240
- Why is that ?
- We just don't have the technology.

443
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,520
- Pizza's here !
- Shit ! Get out !

444
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,920
Some places have pretty good
statewide systems, like Maine.

445
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,240
- My grandma lives in Maine !
- Well then she should be fine.

446
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,880
- My grandma lives in Georgia.
- She is fucked.

447
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,400
Totally fucked !

448
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,200
- Why don't you just try harder ?
- Excuse me ?

449
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:55,520
You think I don't try hard ?
I just worked a twelve-hour shift !

450
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,200
I helped deliver three babies,
I saved a family from a fire,

451
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,200
I pulled a lizard out of a printer,
I listened to 15 different butts !

452
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,120
We'll see how hard you're laughing

453
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,160
when I'm listening to someone's ass
and you're all burning in your beds !

454
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,280
It's so hot ! The flames !
They're lickin' my body !

455
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,160
Who wants to pet a Dalmatian ?

456
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,000
911, we'll be there when you
need us. Some restrictions apply.

457
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,480
Offer not guaranteed in all states.
Contact a medical professional

458
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,400
if you experience a wait time
longer than four hours.

459
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,640
That's our show, thank you so much
for watching, see you next week !

460
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,400
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

461
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,920
END OF EPISODE 12,
SEASON III
