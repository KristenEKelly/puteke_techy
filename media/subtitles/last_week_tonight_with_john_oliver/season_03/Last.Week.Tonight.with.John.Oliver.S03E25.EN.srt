LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
SEASON III
EPISODE 25

3
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,840
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,680
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

5
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,880
Let us dive in straight away
with the 2016 election,

6
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,280
or as it's better known,
"I get it: we all died, this is hell,"

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,680
"and Satan has cursed us to live out
this nightmare for all eternity 2016".

8
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,000
The second presidential debate
wrapped up half an hour ago,

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,280
I don't know anything
about the thoughtful,

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,400
substantive discussion of policy
that I'm assuming took place.

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,720
All I can do is talk about
what led up to the debate this week,

12
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,040
by which I mean, of course, this.

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,880
I tried and fuck her. She was married.
She wanted to get some furniture.

14
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,000
I took her out for furniture.
I moved on her like a bitch.

15
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,920
And when you're a star
they let you do it.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,160
Whatever you want.

17
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,080
Grab them by the pussy.
You can do anything.

18
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,960
Yes, that is audio of Donald Trump,
in 2005,

19
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,560
telling a giggling Billy Bush
that one of the perks of fame

20
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,880
is that he can grab women's genitalia
without permission.

21
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,200
And, let me remind you
that last Sunday,

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,640
I told you if you looked
above the clouds,

23
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,320
you would see rock bottom.

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,440
But, if you look up there now,
just way, way up there,

25
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,160
all the way up high, you will see,
right up in the distance,

26
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,760
where we were this time last week.

27
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,320
Because since then,
we have sunk so low,

28
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,520
we are breaking
through the Earth's crust,

29
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,560
where drowning in boiling magma
will come as sweet, sweet relief.

30
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,280
And, incidentally: fuck Billy Bush !
Fuck that guy. Fuck him !

31
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Fuck him !

32
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,320
Not just for laughing along, but for
doing this once they got off the bus.

33
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,440
- How about a little hug for Donald ?
- Would you like a little hug ?

34
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,840
- Melania said this was okay.
- How about a little hug for the Bushy ?

35
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,280
Here we go ! Excellent !

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,400
It is gross enough that he's serving
as Donald Trump's hugpimp,

37
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,280
but let's not gloss over
the fact that he just said,

38
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,160
"how about a little hug
for the Bushy ?"

39
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,520
a phrase that, if it is not already,

40
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,960
should really be a felony offense
in all 50 states.

41
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,560
That tape has reverberated
throughout the weekend,

42
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,280
despite Trump's efforts to calm
things down with a video apology.

43
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,640
I've never said I'm a perfect person,
nor pretended to be someone I'm not.

44
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,080
Anyone who knows me knows
these words don't reflect who I am.

45
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,960
I said it, I was wrong,
and I apologize.

46
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,840
Let's try and unpack all of that.

47
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,480
First he claims he's never said
he's a perfect person,

48
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,640
which, of course, is a lie.

49
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,040
"I consider myself too perfect..."

50
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,560
Then he says he never pretended
to be someone he's not,

51
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,040
right before claiming,
"these words don't reflect who I am".

52
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,800
Which is absolutely absurd.

53
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,120
They could not capture his essence
more if they were spoken

54
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,840
by a spray-tanned Furby eating KFC
and screaming at a gold star family.

55
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,160
Now, all this left Trump
supporters in a quandary.

56
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,960
His former campaign manager,
Corey Lewandowski,

57
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,520
made some desperate attempts
to deflect attention elsewhere.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,560
We don't have any understanding
what Hillary Clinton has said

59
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,640
in those meetings with Wall Street
where she was paid for these speeches.

60
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,960
Same things
are being said in that regard.

61
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,560
No, the same things
are not being said in that regard.

62
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,920
At the moment
he did that interview,

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,280
Wikileaks was publishing what it claimed
were excerpts from those speeches,

64
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,280
and while there is
some compromising stuff in there,

65
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,040
at no point did she say
to Goldman Sachs bankers,

66
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,080
"I'm for open trade and open borders,
but above all,"

67
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,200
"I'm for luring men to furniture stores
where I can grab them by the dick."

68
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,360
I'm famous.
I can get away with that.

69
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,520
But it soon became clear that this
tape had done some serious damage.

70
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,760
Paul Ryan, the speaker of the
US House of Representatives said:

71
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,920
"I am sickened
by what I heard today."

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,160
"Women are to be championed
revered, not objectified."

73
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,640
Wait, hold on there, hold on:
"Championed and revered" ?

74
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,080
Women are human beings
and not pedigreed show dogs, right ?

75
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,800
"Women should be looked after
with the utmost care:"

76
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,000
"thriceweekly grooming,
regular vet appointments, "

77
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,240
"and then fed high-protein kibble
to maintain the luster of their coats."

78
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,920
Now, there is a second half
to that statement

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,640
and you'll notice,
it does not involve Paul Ryan

80
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,160
withdrawing his
support for Donald Trump.

81
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,200
I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation
with the seriousness it deserves

82
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,480
and works
to demonstrate to the country

83
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,120
that he has greater respect for women
than this clip suggests.

84
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,680
You hope he works
to demonstrate respect for women ?

85
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,200
What are you talking about ?
It's too late in absolutely every way.

86
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,960
It's October of an election year,
and second, he's fucking 70.

87
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,720
But Ryan was not the only
outraged Republican.

88
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,760
They lined up to disavow Trump's
statements, each with a similar theme.

89
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,160
I have five daughters.

90
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,560
And what Mr. Trump said
is offensive to me and my family.

91
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,400
My wife and I,
we have a 15-year-old daughter.

92
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,200
I have a wife, I have a daughter.

93
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,120
I have a mother, and I have 5 sisters.
Although these were not my sisters,

94
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,600
this wasn't my daughter,
my wife, my mother

95
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,000
to whom Donald Trump was speaking
or of whom he was speaking.

96
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,960
This was somebody's sister
or daughter.

97
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,080
It may have been somebody's mother
or somebody's wife.

98
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,720
Look: as, as the son of a mother
and the husband of a wife,

99
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,760
what the fuck does that have to do
with anything ?

100
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,840
You're going through such an elaborate
six degrees of separation exercise

101
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,480
to arrive at someone with a Y
chromosome that you can feel sorry for.

102
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,560
Numerous prominent Republicans

103
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,880
began to withdraw
their support for Trump.

104
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,200
Most notably, the party's
former nominee, John McCain,

105
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,960
who put out a statement saying:
"I will not vote for Donald Trump",

106
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,760
a statement whose bravery
was a little undercut

107
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,560
by the fact it was
his second attempt at a response,

108
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,680
the first of which was much weaker.

109
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,920
Senator John McCain said:
"There are no excuses"

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,200
"for Donald Trump's
offensive and demeaning comments."

111
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,200
"No woman should ever be victimized
by this inappropriate behavior."

112
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,080
"He bears the burden of his conduct
and should suffer the consequences."

113
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,760
Except no, "he alone" does not
bear the burden of his conduct.

114
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,280
Because he alone did not make
himself your party's nominee.

115
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,160
All of you have consistently
supported him

116
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,680
through some
absolutely heinous shit.

117
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,720
In his very first campaign speech,
he called Mexicans rapists

118
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,120
That was just the beginning.
Since then,

119
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,200
he has proposed a temporary ban
on Muslim immigrants,

120
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,880
advocated for killing
terrorists' families,

121
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,760
which is, by the way, a war crime,

122
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,440
argued for waterboarding
even if it doesn't obtain information,

123
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,200
because, and I quote,
"they deserve it anyway",

124
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,400
and this week, he stood by his claims
that the Central Park Five were guilty,

125
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,920
despite the fact that DNA evidence
has since exonerated them.

126
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,920
And all of you still thought
he should be president.

127
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,200
So the only way that you get
to be shocked and outraged now

128
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,960
is if you were cryogenically frozen
until Friday afternoon

129
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,920
and that Access Hollywood tape

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,800
was the first thing you saw
upon being reanimated.

131
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,080
Anything less than that,
and this is on you, too.

132
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,280
And as for Trump,
as for Trump himself,

133
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,080
he still doesn't appear to realize how
horrifying his remarks actually were.

134
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,360
During his apology, he was already
trying to minimize the incident.

135
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,760
Let's be honest:
we're living in the real world.

136
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,680
This is nothing more than a distraction
from the important issues we're facing.

137
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,640
I'm disappointed to hear him
say we are living in the real world.

138
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,400
I had secretly hoped this whole
election was a horrible dream.

139
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,120
And not even my dream,
the dream of a racist teenager

140
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,240
who fell asleep
while masturbating to internet porn.

141
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,920
But second, this is not a distraction,
nor is it even a surprise.

142
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,800
If Jimmy Carter
had been caught saying that stuff,

143
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,880
sure, we would all be shocked.

144
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,080
But with Trump,
it's entirely in character.

145
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,680
While there is talk of Republicans
trying to get him off the ticket,

146
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,760
early voting has begun.

147
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,800
People have already voted for him.
This is happening.

148
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,800
And in a way, perhaps we've always
been heading to this historic moment:

149
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,040
the first female presidential nominee

150
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,800
versus the human embodiment
of every backwards, condescending,

151
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,120
Mad Men-esque boy's club attitude
that has ever existed,

152
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,120
rolled into one, giant, salivating,
dick-size-referencing,

153
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,760
pussy-grabbing
warthog in a red power tie.

154
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,840
And, I'll put it this way:

155
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,400
if American democracy
is a computer game,

156
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,960
and Hillary is completing women's 100
year-quest to get to the oval office,

157
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,760
it kind of makes sense
that this would be the final boss.

158
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,800
And now, this !

159
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,920
A look back at Billy Bush's
creepy bromance with Donald Trump.

160
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,840
Joining us from Palm Beach
is Access Hollywood's Billy Bush,

161
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,240
who's a good friend of the Donald
and his bride-to-be...

162
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,800
- You ready to get going ?
- Certainly ready.

163
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,440
Let's get this party started.
The man is here.

164
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,840
Who has more access to you,
me or Melania ?

165
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,240
I would say
you have slightly more access.

166
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,720
They should want me.
I'm a ratings machine.

167
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,640
If I don't know that's Billy Bush,
there's something wrong.

168
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,720
Are you prepared,
mentally, physically,

169
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,320
to take over as president
of the United States ?

170
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,560
Physically, I'm prepared.
I'm in very good shape.

171
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,320
Very powerful man. And mentally,
perhaps I'm not prepared.

172
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,440
Do I make him laugh ?
Is he like this with everybody ?

173
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,960
Billy Bush's actual
outgoing voicemail message.

174
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,240
You've reached Billy Bush's office.
He's busy making America great again.

175
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,520
Let's go !

176
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,560
Moving on: our main story tonight
concerns President Obama.

177
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,320
A man so close
to being able to smoke again

178
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
he can almost taste those Camels.

179
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,240
His time in office is almost done.
He's achieved a great many things,

180
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,440
but tonight we're going to look
at one of his failures.

181
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,760
I have ordered the prison at
Guantanamo Bay closed by next year.

182
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,320
Make no mistake:
we will close Guantanamo prison.

183
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,040
I still want to close Guantanamo.
I have tried to close Gitmo.

184
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,680
I will continue to push to close Gitmo.
It's time to close Gitmo.

185
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,520
The department
is submitting to Congress our plan

186
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,920
for finally closing
the facility at Guantanamo.

187
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,160
Yes, Guantanamo Bay.
It's Obama's "one that got away."

188
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,920
A little odd, considering it's a place
where literally no one can get away.

189
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,480
So why has the president
been unable to close Gitmo ?

190
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,160
For a start,
most people don't want him to.

191
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,760
52 percent of Americans
believe it should remain open.

192
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,920
There are others who believe
we should be using it more.

193
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,520
The only problem
with Guantanamo Bay

194
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,480
is there are too many
empty beds and cells.

195
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,280
We should be sending more terrorists
there for further interrogation.

196
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,840
As far as I'm concerned,
every last one of 'em can rot in hell.

197
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,560
But they can rot
in Guantanamo Bay.

198
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,560
He is saying, "Let's use Guantanamo
Bay like hell's waiting room."

199
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,280
That is problematic for two reasons:
first, it's arguably unconstitutional.

200
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,800
Second, "hell's waiting room" is the
slogan of Henry Kissinger's bedroom.

201
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,200
That's a fact. That's just a fact.

202
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,680
I can see the reasons
that Guantanamo is appealing.

203
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,840
You get to keep potentially dangerous
people locked up and far away.

204
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,760
I'd like to argue that there are even
better reasons for closing it forever.

205
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,080
Let's start with the practical ones.

206
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,280
It's very expensive. Guantanamo
cost $445 million to run last year,

207
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,000
which means we're currently spending
over $7 million per prisoner per year.

208
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,680
But the costs
obviously go way beyond that.

209
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,640
Last year, a UN Human Rights Council
conducted a review of the US,

210
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,880
and Gitmo was something
of a feature.

211
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,360
Iceland recommends the closure
of the Guantanamo prison.

212
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,600
End illegal detentions
in Guantanamo Bay.

213
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,000
Close the Guantanamo Bay facility.

214
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:26,000
And do its best in order to close down
the Guantanamo facilities.

215
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,720
Improve living conditions in prisons,
in particular, in Guantanamo.

216
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,120
Investigate torture allegation,
extrajudicial execution,

217
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,080
and other violations of human rights
committed in Guantanamo.

218
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,440
Yeah, you heard right, that is Iran,
Sudan, Libya, and others

219
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,040
lecturing us
about human rights abuses.

220
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,560
Which is yeah, a little hypocritical,
maybe don't tell us to eat healthy

221
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,360
when you have a fucking Whopperito
in your mouth.

222
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,640
But, does seem like this is one of the
few things the entire world agrees on.

223
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,120
It's "Guantanamo is fucked up",
and "Yeah, you know what ?"

224
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,400
"Kevin can wait.
Yeah. He can. Let the man wait."

225
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,680
So, how did we get here ?
Guantanamo's origins

226
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,360
are a series of weird circumstances
and ad-hoc decisions.

227
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,840
For a start, we don't own it.
It's a rental.

228
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,960
In 1903, we struck a deal with Cuba
to lease the land for a naval base,

229
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,880
and ever since, we have mailed them
a check every year for "$4,085 in rent"

230
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:32,200
although, as Fidel Castro once told,
they've been accumulating in his desk.

231
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,280
Those are checks
from the US government ?

232
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,840
These are checks
from the US government...

233
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,560
- Guantanamo's rent ?
- Yes.

234
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,240
Just think about that:
we've barely been talking to Cuba.

235
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,240
We disagree with their politics.

236
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,080
And yet, we send them checks for
hilariously small amounts of money.

237
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,640
We're basically Cuba's grandparents.

238
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,640
And this unique arrangement
means that Guantanamo,

239
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,720
Guantanamo is legally
both America, and not America

240
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,400
or, as one White House
official once called it,

241
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,040
"the legal equivalent
of outer space."

242
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,920
Which is a bit of an exaggeration.
Some laws do apply up in space.

243
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,520
There's the laws of physics,
and the law of attraction.

244
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,360
Of course, you didn't really think Neil
and Buzz did not fuck on the Moon !

245
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,080
They moonfucked.
They moonfucked, my friends.

246
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,560
They moonfucked good.
Deal with it. Deal with that.

247
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,960
And this legal limbo
has been useful to us in the past.

248
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,160
George HW Bush used Guantanamo
to involuntarily detain

249
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,200
Haitian refugees seeking asylum.

250
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,200
Bill Clinton not only continued that,
he used it to hold Cuban refugees.

251
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,320
So the use of Gitmo to store people

252
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,880
was one of those dicey legal
workarounds in the nineties.

253
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,880
It was right up there
with Vanilla Ice's explanation

254
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,680
of why he didn't rip off Queen.

255
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,800
It's not the same bassline.

256
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,480
It goes...

257
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,840
Ours goes...

258
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,480
That makes sense. You've got
a rock solid case there, Vanilla.

259
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,400
No problem there.

260
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:23,120
Stashing those refugees at Gitmo
attracted significant criticism.

261
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,120
But when the war on terror began,
we started doing the exact same thing

262
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,560
with terror suspects,
even though, right from the start,

263
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,160
Donald Rumsfeld admitted
it was far from the perfect solution.

264
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,360
We've gotten into trouble every time
we've tried to use Guantanamo Bay

265
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,200
to hold people, for other reasons.

266
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,320
Why use it ?
Why is it the best place ?

267
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,160
I would characterize
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,

268
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,920
as the least worst place
we could have selected.

269
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,400
"The least worst place".
That is a rousing endorsement

270
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,280
from the worst secretary of defense
of all time.

271
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,240
But there was a problem with using
Guantanamo in the War on Terror,

272
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,840
and people were pointing it out
at the time.

273
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,200
How do you avoid the prospect of
the US military in fact being jailers

274
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,400
for an indeterminate period of time
of people who have not been charged ?

275
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,800
What are you going to do about it ?

276
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,120
It is certainly not the first choice
of the Department of Defense

277
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,120
to be in the business of detaining
people for long periods of time.

278
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,920
Yeah, it might not have been his
first choice, but it was inevitable.

279
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,760
'Cause a War on Terror
isn't a traditional war,

280
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,680
where there's an exchange
of prisoners at the end.

281
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,400
We were never going
to accept a formal surrender

282
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,240
from the President of Terror,
who I can only assume is Willem Dafoe.

283
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:51,720
And now that brings us to here,
nearly a decade and a half later,

284
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,480
and we are all so accustomed
to the very existence of Guantanamo

285
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,800
that news crews tour it
like it's a million-dollar listing.

286
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,360
This is a typical cell in Camp 5.

287
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,880
It meets all American Correctional
Association standards.

288
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,680
This is about 95 square feet
of living space

289
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,120
with about 80
feet of unencumbered space.

290
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,720
One of the other amenities is a library
of books, magazines, and video games.

291
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,600
The book that we have the most
would be the Harry Potter series.

292
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,840
Inmates are also given art classes,
the results of which are on display.

293
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,240
He's making it sound like the world's
least-Jewish summer camp.

294
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,720
Who's doing Birthright next year ?
Nobody is.

295
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,760
Although even the current luxuries
the prisoners get

296
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,800
tend to carry a chilling reminder
of where they are.

297
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,280
Toiletries happen to have
the brand name "Maximum Security".

298
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:51,440
A prison calling its deodorant
"Maximum Security" is on the nose.

299
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,880
It would be like
a Holiday Inn Express

300
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,320
calling its complimentary lotion
"Tearful Masturbation".

301
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,600
That hit home a little
too close for some of you.

302
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,440
Before you think that those books
provided an escape for the inmates,

303
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,160
listen to Shaker Aamer,
released last October

304
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,520
after being held without charge
for nearly 14 years.

305
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,120
He found one book less an escape,
and more a reminder of where he was.

306
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,200
They got an island in Harry Potter,
it says Azbakan,

307
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,120
where there's no happiness, they
suck all your feelings out of you.

308
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,600
And you don't have
no feeling anymore.

309
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,200
That's how I felt all the time,
is this is Azbakan.

310
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,040
This is not from this world,
that's what they tried.

311
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,960
They want to make you feelingless.

312
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,120
That is the saddest allusion to
Harry Potter I have ever heard.

313
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,880
I say that as a man
who is often described

314
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,520
as "Harry Potter
if he aged like a president".

315
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,360
That's the point:
no amount of sugar coating

316
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,920
can cover up the reality of what
we have done at Guantanamo Bay.

317
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,920
In the early years, interrogation
techniques included beatings,

318
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,800
prisoner's arms and legs are
shackled together for long periods

319
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,640
and hours and sometimes days
of repeated loud music.

320
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,520
Although sometimes
that last technique backfired.

321
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:33,120
That same Harry Potter-loving
inmate grew up loving rock music

322
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,760
and would annoy
the guards by singing along.

323
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,600
Listen to him describe the song that
gave him the most consolation.

324
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,200
I'm sure everybody will laugh,
I used to sing it a lot.

325
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,520
I thought the words, it fits me.
Makes me feel like it's me again.

326
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,760
Which is the Whitesnake,
it's "Here I go again".

327
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,160
The words goes,
here I go again on my own.

328
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,480
Going down the only road
I've ever known.

329
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,320
Like a drifter
I was born to walk alone,

330
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,160
'cause I know what it means to walk
alone on only street of dreams,

331
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,840
and here I go again.

332
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,880
And it's true.
Because it's just dreams.

333
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,840
Dreams that I will be home one day,
that I will be free,

334
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,080
that Guantanamo will be closed.

335
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,400
You know you are miserable
when you are finding solace

336
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,280
in a fucking Whitesnake song.

337
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,800
A group whose second-most
inspirational lyrics are probably:

338
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,560
I know you ain't a bad girl,
No matter what the neighbors say,

339
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,880
It's just you wear
those skin-tight dresses,

340
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,400
With your G-string tuned to "A".

341
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,120
Pure poetry.
Purist poetry.

342
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,200
We justified Gitmo,
and everything we did inside it,

343
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,000
because we were constantly
reminded of one thing.

344
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,640
These are not innocents.
These are among the worst of the worst.

345
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,880
These are the worst of the worst.

346
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,160
These are the people who are
the bomb makers,

347
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,360
the bodyguards of Osama bin Laden,
the financers, the plotters,

348
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,160
the people who have been sent out to
be assassins, to be suicide bombers.

349
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,880
These are the worst of the worst.

350
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,200
The worst of the worst
is a big claim.

351
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,040
I can think of at least one person
who fits and who is not in there,

352
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,320
because apparently he still
is working for the Today Show.

353
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,800
But, who knows ?
While some detainees,

354
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,440
like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, have
earned that title, others have not.

355
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,920
If they were really all so terrible,
it's a little shocking

356
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,680
that we've released 710 detainees
over the years.

357
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,200
Leaked documents have revealed
that, out of the 212 Afghans there,

358
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,400
almost half were
in the assessments of US forces,

359
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,720
either entirely innocent,
mere Taliban conscripts,

360
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,080
or had been transferred to Guantanamo
with "no reason for doing so on file".

361
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,120
Some of the evidence against
detainees was surprisingly flimsy.

362
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:06,120
One piece of evidence they would use
to determine, Casio watches.

363
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,200
It's kind of a little bit arbitrary,

364
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,920
but anybody who was wearing
this particular brand of Casio watch

365
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,760
which was handed out
by al Qaeda to their fighters

366
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,040
because it was used as a timer
for setting off devices.

367
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,400
So anybody who happened
to have this very popular watch on

368
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,480
was picked up, a lot of them
ended up in Guantanamo Bay.

369
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,960
That's true. If someone
was caught wearing this Casio watch,

370
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,520
that could be used
as crucial evidence.

371
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,680
That makes this the only
time in history

372
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,160
anyone has actively sought out
a man wearing a Casio watch.

373
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,960
This is not to say that everyone in
Guantanamo is, or was, innocent.

374
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,440
There is justifiable concern
that, when we release someone,

375
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,520
they might go on
to fight against us.

376
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,760
The government claims that six percent
of those released under Obama

377
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,240
have been confirmed to have reengaged
in insurgent or terrorist activities,

378
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,560
and for those released by the Bush
administration, it's been 21%.

379
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,160
Some argue
those numbers are inflated,

380
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,480
even if they are,
they are not zero.

381
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,160
That is why politicians
like Dick Cheney

382
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,800
have taken a hardline position
that we should not let anyone go.

383
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,960
I'm more concerned with bad guys
who got out and released

384
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,000
than I am with a few that,
in fact, were innocent.

385
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,880
- You're okay with that error ?
- As long as we achieve our objective.

386
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,560
Yeah, but that is not reassuring.
The only objectives Cheney achieved

387
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,720
have been somehow serving
as president unofficially,

388
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,080
and managing to exist without
the need for a working heart.

389
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:45,400
There are divisions about what we
should do with remaining population.

390
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,480
You should know:
there's actually not that many left.

391
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,320
There are currently just
61 detainees down there.

392
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,760
That's less than the number
of people in our audience now.

393
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,440
Some of whom are arguably worse
people than some of the detainees.

394
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,080
They know it,
deep down they know it.

395
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:11,720
It's an odd thing to clap.
And you might think:

396
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,760
"why doesn't the president
put them on trial,"

397
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,360
"figure out which are guilty
and decide to close it ?"

398
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,240
It's not that simple, the 61 detainees
fall into three groups.

399
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:28,080
Ten of them are having their cases
handled by a military commission.

400
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,760
A legal process that we've
basically invented from scratch

401
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,360
it's so flawed that
of its 8 convictions so far,

402
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,720
four have been fully reversed
on appeal.

403
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,840
Another 20 are slated for release,
but are waiting for state department,

404
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:46,200
intelligence agencies and department
of defense to agree where to send them.

405
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,960
And that leaves us with
the trickiest group: the remaining 31,

406
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,280
who have not been charged, but
also not cleared to be released.

407
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,760
They are the real problem here.

408
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,520
Even the president doesn't
quite know what to do with them.

409
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,160
There's going to be
a irreducible number

410
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,960
that are going to be
really hard cases,

411
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,440
we know they've done something
wrong and they are still dangerous.

412
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,960
It's difficult to mount the evidence in
a traditional article three court.

413
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,520
Think about what he just said:
that is the president,

414
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,000
a man who has taught
constitutional law,

415
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,560
suggesting that for some detainees,
there is no clear path

416
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,280
toward a trial or an exit.

417
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,560
It's a group the administration has
called the "irreducible minimum",

418
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,240
sounds like a band that was
going to call itself "Absolute Zero",

419
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,400
but got into a fight about it
with their theremin player.

420
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,160
If you're wondering why he says
it's difficult to "mount the evidence",

421
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,640
what he means there is, in some
cases, there's not enough of it,

422
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,920
in others,
obtained through torture.

423
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,960
And there is a good reason
that that is inadmissible:

424
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,360
because people often say
anything to make torture stop.

425
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,200
If you gave me a purple nurple
for just ten seconds,

426
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,560
I would swear that my favorite
cereal is Grape Nuts,

427
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,440
and I'm fairly sure that that
cereal's original name was

428
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,920
"Good Morning Idiot,
Eat Some Cat Litter".

429
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,400
The point is,
how does the president,

430
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,160
who has spent a decade promising to
close Gitmo, plan to do that ?

431
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,760
It all depends on what your
definition of the word "close" is.

432
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,440
Closing Guantanamo at this stage,
in the Obama administration view,

433
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,160
is moving Guantanamo
to US soil.

434
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,120
The idea is to pick up
the last detainees

435
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,480
and move them to military
detention in the US,

436
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
what we call "Guantanamo North."

437
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,920
Yes, "Guantanamo North".
Or, as I'm sure it will be called

438
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,760
once they build a Whole Foods
there: "Gitmo-No".

439
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,760
Moving Guantanamo is not closing it.
Even that is not going to happen.

440
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,040
There's been congressional opposition
to moving any detainees to US soil,

441
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,440
and the people in charge seem
to be settling in for long haul.

442
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:08,040
We know that because a legal
document from last month

443
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,480
showed the current commander there,
proposes renovating their infirmary,

444
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,520
as it will be beneficial to the
continued care of the aging population.

445
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,360
So there might well be detainees
that we scooped up as young men,

446
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,440
who we think are guilty,
but who will never get a trial,

447
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,760
and they will be there
until they die.

448
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,400
And at this point,
we all have to ask ourselves:

449
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,200
are we okay with that ?

450
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,560
It does seem that more
than half of us are.

451
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,080
But I would argue that any potential
risk in putting detainees on trial,

452
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,640
losing that case, and having
to release them, is worth it.

453
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,920
For a few important reasons:
first, as it stands,

454
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,360
we are ceding so much
moral high ground

455
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,040
that Vladimir Putin feels comfortable
saying things like this.

456
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,520
They once said that they would
close Guantanamo. And what ?

457
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,280
Is it closed ? No.

458
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,880
There are still people
there walking in shackles.

459
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,960
That is medieval. Without a trial,
these people stay in prison.

460
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,280
Just imagine, it's incredible.

461
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,600
Can you imagine if we did that
here ? I can't wrap my head around it.

462
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,320
Yes, I am befuddled
by their behavior.

463
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,720
Luckily, here in Russia, the people
I do not like just disappear

464
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,320
for reasons nobody will ever know
and nobody needs to worry about.

465
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:30,440
But Guantanamo. It blows
my mind. Blows my mind.

466
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,400
While supporters of Guantanamo
argue that closing it

467
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,080
would be a sign of weakness,
I would argue it's an act of strength.

468
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,440
Listen to Lawrence Wilkerson,
Colin Powell's former chief of staff.

469
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,960
What do we do with them ?
Do we leave them there forever ?

470
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,920
As an American citizen
who is not a coward,

471
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,400
I'd be willing to release
them tomorrow morning

472
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,480
and face them on the battlefield
again if necessary.

473
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,320
But we've got a lot of cowards
in this country.

474
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,560
Exactly. When you see a bumper sticker
that says "freedom isn't free",

475
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,200
this is what that means:
standing up for our highest ideals

476
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,640
even when it requires accepting
a certain amount of risk.

477
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,080
When that bumper sticker is
displayed above a pair of truck nuts,

478
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,360
it's a good reminder that doing
something like that takes balls.

479
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,360
There is one
final thing to consider here.

480
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,240
Concept of Guantanamo
represents an opportunity

481
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,840
to operate outside the
boundaries of the law,

482
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,600
and that is way too tempting to have
at the government's disposal.

483
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,680
While you might be someone who
trusts President Obama's judgment,

484
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,040
remember:
he's on his way out now.

485
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,280
Meaning that the keys to Azkaban
will be handed over

486
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,480
to whoever succeeds him and there
is a possibility it's going to be him.

487
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,560
We're going to keep, as you know,
Gitmo, we're keeping that open.

488
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,040
We're gonna load it up with
bad dudes out there.

489
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:06,040
That's the point. If we don't shut
it down, future president Trump

490
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,640
could throw anyone
he doesn't like into Guantanamo.

491
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,280
And you might say: "He'd have
to come up with some pretext."

492
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,680
"And it couldn't be
an American citizen."

493
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,560
I've been shit-talking this
guy for the better part of a year

494
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,640
and I own a fucking Casio watch.

495
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,800
So we need to shut this shit
down now. And now, this.

496
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,640
And now, a look back at Billy Bush
being creepy with everyone.

497
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,240
How do you feel about your butt ?

498
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,240
- You did not just ask me that.
- I did.

499
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,520
I was in my pajamas all day
just walking around the house.

500
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,960
Slow down here, this is
the good one, yeah.

501
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,800
I was in my negligée.

502
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,440
You're the best looking girl.
Are you single or are you boyfriend ?

503
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:58,120
What's going on gorgeous ?
You are so beautiful !

504
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,880
An inappropriate question:

505
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,560
do you ever send intimate pictures
to one another on the phone ?

506
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:10,240
The talk right now, is your
dress, so. Let's get this going here.

507
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,640
That white number you wore the other
night, where were you...

508
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,280
At the People's Choice.

509
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,200
What's going on with the calorie
intake over here ladies ?

510
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,240
There's the lovely Nancy O'Dell,
working on her computer.

511
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,720
Let Uncle Bushy read
you guys a story, okay ?

512
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,960
Somebody take my picture quickly.

513
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,520
The best looking and the cutest
Disney Channel girl, you think ?

514
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,880
Probably Selena Gomez.

515
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,680
We made that call here, we think
he likes the exotic and the dark.

516
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,920
Selena, you're 17, if you don't
look good without makeup,

517
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,840
I'd pack it in,
same with Miley.

518
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,920
Some family jewelry right there.

519
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,800
Maybe a photo of your family jewels
to make sure you don't want that.

520
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,160
Moving on.

521
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,760
Finally tonight, we turn to Chechnya:
Russia's Florida,

522
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,040
in that it shares a border with Georgia
and doesn't seem to have any laws.

523
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,400
Its leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, is known
for its human-rights abuses,

524
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,880
his close ties to Vladimir Putin,
and his phenomenal Instagram page,

525
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,320
where you can see him
attempting to make out with a deer.

526
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,440
You can tell that even that
deer is thinking:

527
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,800
"I'll give you one kiss because
I'm a deer and I'm stupid,"

528
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,000
"but shouldn't you be running
a republic right now ?"

529
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,560
We talked about Kadyrov in May,
when he'd lost his cat,

530
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,080
and he was asking his people
to help him locate it.

531
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,800
We asked you to take photos
of any cats you saw,

532
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,920
and send them to Kadyrov, asking:
"Is this your cat ?"

533
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,000
Apparently he didn't find
that very funny,

534
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:06,560
because he Instagrammed this
image of me in a Putin t-shirt,

535
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,000
with the caption: "I'm tired of jokes.
I want to care for cats in Chechnya."

536
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,120
"By the way,
Putin is our leader !"

537
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:19,920
I'm tired of a great many jokes,
but asking Kadyrov "is this your cat ?"

538
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,040
is emphatically not one of them.

539
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,960
This week, I do have an update
for you on Kadyrov,

540
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,560
but it is not that he has found
his cat, he hasn't.

541
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,800
I'm guessing he's seeking comfort
in the old Chechen saying:

542
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,960
"every time Kadyrov
loses a pet,"

543
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,440
"the terrible forest wolves
gain a snack."

544
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,600
Something almost
as exciting happened to him.

545
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,320
The regions were electing new
leaders and local deputies.

546
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,160
The most convincing result was shown
by leader of Chechnya, Kadyrov.

547
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,640
He has more
than 97 percent of votes.

548
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,200
Yes, Kadyrov won reelection
with 97 percent of the vote.

549
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:05,400
Not 100%. 97. It's a gentleman's
dictatorial landslide.

550
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,800
Turkmenistan's leader was reelected
with 97 percent of the vote,

551
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,280
as was Egypt's el-Sisi,
and Syria's Bashir al-Assad

552
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,680
earned both his first and second term
with 97 percent.

553
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,800
That number seems to sum up
the tyrant's mindset perfectly.

554
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,640
I'm paranoid enough to know
that 100 percent is too high

555
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:30,400
and yet I'm delusional enough to
think 96 percent is a real nail-biter.

556
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,120
Kadyrov's reelection is by no means
the most eye-catching thing.

557
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,560
Because cat or no cat and, to be
absolutely clear, no cat,

558
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,920
Kadyrov has had himself
quite the summer.

559
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,600
A few weeks ago, he held a celebration
for Chechen Women's Day.

560
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,160
This is how
he was dressed for dinner.

561
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,800
Who wears a suit of armor to
a Women's Day dinner ?

562
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,560
Congratulations, ladies !
To honor you,

563
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,680
I am wearing clothing from an era
when you had no rights !

564
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,600
Serving wench ! Bring me my
Women's Day wine !

565
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,520
That was just the beginning.
Kadyrov has three young sons,

566
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,240
pictured here being hugged by
what is either Steven Seagal

567
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,080
or a tomato with a goatee,
it's unclear.

568
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,240
If you follow Kadyrov on Instagram,
which you really should,

569
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,520
you will know he has been training
his children in mixed martial arts.

570
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,960
And if his unlicensed boxing gym
for sweaty tots were not weird enough,

571
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:48,800
and it very much is, this week,
he staged a series of MMA fights

572
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,960
featuring each of his three sons,
as he sat there and watched.

573
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,400
I don't know what I find
more upsetting there:

574
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,560
the fact adults are cheering
on fighting children,

575
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,840
or the fact that any one of those
children could beat the shit out of me.

576
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,120
Wait, we're still not done here.
Because this week,

577
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,880
the same week he staged his
child's fight and was reelected,

578
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,360
Kadyrov launched
his own reality show.

579
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,200
We are inviting the most talented
people to the republic.

580
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,000
Those who want to work in the territory
of the republic of Chechnya

581
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,520
for the good of the people and
in the interests of our country.

582
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,360
If you are sure of yourself,
challenge yourself,

583
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:36,120
show that you are capable
of solving state scale tasks.

584
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,960
Gifted and ambitious leaders
from all over the country,

585
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,680
any sex and age, will go through
a rigorous recruitment process.

586
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,920
Only one will build the
future of Chechnya with Kadyrov.

587
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,840
Kadyrov has his own reality show,
contestants compete

588
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,240
to be the head of Chechnya's
strategic development agency

589
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,280
which might just mean spotting
an eight-year-old in the weight room.

590
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,080
But, the bigger picture here is,
I think I know what you're thinking:

591
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,720
an authoritarian nutcase
who wants to rule the land

592
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,240
has a reality show where people
compete to be his employee ?

593
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,960
That's the most ridiculous
thing I have ever...

594
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,200
I'm hearing it out loud, I get it,
never mind, let's move on.

595
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,920
I can make fun of Kadyrov,
until he murders me.

596
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,120
But you've got to admit:
he is living a dream right now.

597
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,720
He's got Chechnya's highest office,
his own reality show,

598
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,920
and he's got a level of power so great

599
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,400
that no one will tell him
not to stage televised child fights

600
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,400
or show up to dinner dressed like
the oldest Ren-fair enthusiast.

601
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,840
Kadyrov has everything he wants.
There are no words I could say

602
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,480
to remind him that
he is missing something.

603
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,240
Other than...

604
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,040
Ramzan Kadyrov,
I have a quick question for you:

605
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,480
Is this your cat ?

606
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,000
Is this your cat, Ramzan ?
I'm 97 percent sure that it is.

607
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,240
That's our show. Thank you.
See you next week. Goodnight !

608
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,880
There you go.
Yeah. Are you his cat ?

609
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,680
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

610
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,720
END OF EPISODE 25,
SEASON III
