00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,600
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,800
SEASON III
EPISODE 11

3
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,720
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
Thank you so much for joining us.

4
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,960
I'm John Oliver.
Time for a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,680
And obviously,
the big news here in the U.S.

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,320
is that Donald Trump is the presumptive
republican nominee for president.

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,360
That's right,
this sentient circus peanut

8
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,120
now holds the future
of a major political party

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,760
in his tiny, raccoon-pawsized hands,
which is frankly a little surprising,

10
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,160
because the Internet repeatedly told me
I had destroyed and eviscerated him.

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,080
Why would they say
that if it wasn't true ?

12
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,480
If you are feeling depressed about
the current state of this election,

13
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,760
let me give you some perspective
from the Philippines.

14
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,760
The world's Rorschach test.

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,080
I see an upside down feather
and my father's disappointment.

16
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,400
Their presidential election
takes place tomorrow.

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,320
The front-runner is Rodrigo Duterte.
And he is a colorful character.

18
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,040
Rodrigo Duterte
is far from your average politician.

19
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,080
His off-the-cuff remarks
are legendary.

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,840
At this mass wedding, Duterte offers
himself as a gift to the young brides.

21
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,920
I don't have money to give but I could
give your wives something else.

22
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,520
And this is for the wives only.

23
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,600
Men, I'm sorry, but you don't get
anything, because I'm not a queer.

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,560
That kind of homophobia during
a wedding usually only happens

25
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,360
when the father of the bride
has six whiskey sours

26
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,720
and decides to tell what he thinks about
Cam and Mitchell on "Modern Family".

27
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,440
Not a fan. And that's
just the tip of the iceberg.

28
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,320
Duterte routinely kisses
his female supporters,

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,280
once called the pope
a son-of-a-bitch,

30
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,640
all of which has earned him a
reputation as the "Trump of the East",

31
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,320
a title previously held by a burnt
wonton covered in scarecrow pubes.

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,640
Duterte has suggested, if elected,
he would kill 5 criminals every week.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,040
Which may not be an idle promise
since he's been mayor,

34
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,120
extrajudicial death squads have
reportedly killed over 1 000 people.

35
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,760
While he denies any involvement,
he admits he's got blood on his hands.

36
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,920
- So no qualms about killing killers ?
- Yes of course.

37
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,600
I must admit I have killed.

38
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,440
Three months early on,
I killed about...

39
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Three people ?

40
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,920
I'm sorry, about three people ?

41
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,920
That's not good. Not knowing
how many people you've killed

42
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,720
is like not knowing
how many Vicodin you took.

43
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,120
If you don't know the exact number
the answer is "way too fucking many".

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,320
And yet, none of this has hurt him.

45
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,440
More than half of his city's residents
think the death squad is "ok",

46
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,000
which is a surprisingly
measured response.

47
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,640
"Death squads ? They're okay. Could be
deathier. Hashtag squad goals."

48
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,520
At times, though,
Duterte has seemed

49
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,920
like he's trying to test the limits
of basic human decency.

50
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,640
On the campaign trail, he delivered
a speech that was truly nauseating.

51
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,120
He was the mayor of Davao
when an Australian missionary

52
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,920
was murdered and gang raped
in 1989 in the jail in Davao City

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,320
where he's still the mayor today.

54
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,960
I was angry she was raped, yes,
that was one thing,

55
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,600
but she was so beautiful.

56
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,160
I think the mayor
should have been first.

57
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,800
What a fucking asshole.

58
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,000
If any part of you is thinking,
"was that some horrific joke ?",

59
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,480
please know:
he meant every word of it.

60
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,720
It was not a joke.
I said it in a narrative.

61
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:22,480
I was not smiling,
I was just talking plain sense.

62
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,440
Let this be a lesson to all of us.
When we say:

63
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,920
"I want a politician who'll tell me
what he really thinks,"

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,320
we should specify that that politician
should not be a total fucking monster.

65
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,080
And yet, incredibly, this man
is leading in the polls by 11 points,

66
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,440
so he's probably going
to get elected president tomorrow.

67
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,280
Which isn't just terrifying
for the Philippines.

68
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,200
In a year's time, we could be treated
to this as an official state visit.

69
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,640
Let's move on to some lighter news
in North Korea.

70
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,040
Alphabetically speaking,
the world's foremost Korea.

71
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,440
This week,
that country saw a major event.

72
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,760
Ominous developments
in North Korea right now

73
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,120
where the biggest political event
in decades is under way.

74
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,080
The first gathering of the communist
party elites in some 36 years.

75
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,800
The North Korean workers party
had its first gathering since 1980.

76
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,280
The first order of business
was therefore,

77
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,080
"God, how good was 'Cheers' ?
How good was Cheers, guys ?"

78
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,280
This event was so momentous,
North Korea actually invited

79
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,520
around 130 foreign journalists
to come cover it.

80
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,120
Where they got the chance
to meet some normal,

81
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,280
everyday, completely unscripted
Pyongyang citizens.

82
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,040
Kim Jong-un
is the best one in the world.

83
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,560
The most powerful country
in the world.

84
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,040
What should America know
about your leader ?

85
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,440
Comrade Kim is the best in the world,
she says. And a peacemaker.

86
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,280
We don't have anything
against Americans,

87
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,200
but we don't like
American policymakers, she said.

88
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,640
What do you think
of President Obama ?

89
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,760
If she's given the weapon,
she wants to shoot at him.

90
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,160
If she's given a weapon,
she would shoot at President Obama ?

91
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,000
She wants to shoot at him.

92
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,200
Yeah, wow.

93
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,000
There is literally no other response
to that than "wow".

94
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,600
You don't often hear assassination
threats in the same wistful tone

95
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,760
you'd say: "If I had a bread maker,
it would be focaccia every morning".

96
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,200
The choreographed tour
for the journalists didn't stop there.

97
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,280
They were taken to a model farm
that seemed weirdly devoid of farmers,

98
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,040
a nursery school
with this on the wall,

99
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,760
and even a gun factory turned museum
with great historical significance.

100
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,680
We're told the founder
and President Kim Il-sung test fired

101
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,440
the first locally produced submachine
gun 50 meters, more than 160 feet,

102
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,840
hitting those two targets
with a bulls-eye every time.

103
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,280
This rifle apparently fired by the
founder of the DPRK Kim Il-sung,

104
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,560
even his wife
and then later his son Kim Jong-Il.

105
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,320
They all, apparently,
hit bulls eye.

106
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,120
Comrade Kim Jong-Il shot 3 bullets
and 3 of them got bulls-eye.

107
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,400
- And how old was he at the time ?
- He was 7-year-old.

108
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,320
A 7-year-old got three bulls-eyes ?
That's pretty impressive.

109
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,600
That is a very professional
translator !

110
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,000
A 7-year-old got 3 bulls-eyes ?"

111
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
- "A 7 year old ?"
- "I said mmm-hm".

112
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,600
The whole point of the trip
was to attend Kim Jong-un's speech.

113
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,800
The journalists
were not allowed into the building,

114
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,120
were instead taken back
to their hotel,

115
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,880
where they couldn't watch
the speech on state TV,

116
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,000
because as one of them
showed on Vine

117
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,440
it was airing an old black-and-white
Korean military drama.

118
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,600
Her readers
were reduced to watching

119
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,200
someone watching
North Korean television.

120
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,480
And now you're watching
this show

121
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,400
watch someone
watching North Korean television.

122
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,360
It's like a Russian nesting doll
if every piece was less entertaining

123
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,880
than a plain wooden doll
that does nothing.

124
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,160
But thankfully, 13 hours later,

125
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,360
the state TV did give some inkling of
what was going on inside the meeting.

126
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,360
The state television channel
broke in to regular programming,

127
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,760
announcing that Kim Jong-un
will be elected this weekend

128
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,800
to a new even more grandiose title
than the one he currently holds.

129
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,160
Kim Jong-un is getting a title bump.

130
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,680
I guess the only question
is what is the title going to be ?

131
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,120
Will it be "supreme leader" ?
"Triple supreme leader" ?

132
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,600
I happen to think
the most fitting would be,

133
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,040
"Kim-leesi, mother of dragons"
because think about it:

134
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,920
given his unpredictable violence
and fantastical family history,

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,360
he's perhaps the only person on earth
who could win the Game of Thrones.

136
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,480
And now this !

137
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,240
And now, the next
President of the United States.

138
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,760
The next President
of the United States, John Edwards.

139
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,960
The next President
of the United States, John McCain.

140
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,320
The next President
of the United States, Newt Gingrich.

141
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,200
Our next President
of the United States, Al Gore.

142
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,600
The next President
of the United States, Michele Bachman.

143
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,000
Gary Johnson, then next President
of the United States.

144
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,240
The next President
of the United States, Dick Gephardt.

145
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,440
You are looking at the next President
of United States of America !

146
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,920
Ralph Nader, the next President !

147
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,480
The next President
of the United States, Ted Cruz !

148
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,160
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns science.

149
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,720
The thing we love and respect so much,
we allow scientists to be portrayed

150
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,000
by Arnold Schwarzenegger,
Nicolas Cage, and Al Pacino.

151
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,640
That is how much we respect them and
the complexity of the work they do.

152
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,800
Science is constantly producing
new studies,

153
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,160
as you would know,
if you ever watched TV.

154
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,120
A new study shows how sugar
might fuel the growth of cancer.

155
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,400
Late-night snacking
could damage the part of your brain

156
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,440
that creates and stores memories.

157
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,680
A new study finds pizza is the
most addictive food in America.

158
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,120
A new study suggests hugging
your dog is bad for your dog.

159
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,000
A new study showing
that drinking a glass of red wine

160
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,800
is just as good as spending
an hour at the gym.

161
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,200
What ? That last one... No !

162
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,000
Look, that last one doesn't
even sound like science.

163
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,640
It's more like something your
sassy aunt would wear on a t-shirt.

164
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,520
And when studies aren't blanketing TV,
they're all over your Facebook feed:

165
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,080
"study finds liberals are better
than conservatives at smizing",

166
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,160
"your cat might be thinking
about killing you",

167
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,800
and "scientific study shows
that bears engage in fellatio".

168
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:11,160
Let me know when bears start engaging
in some mutually pleasurable 69ing.

169
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,640
#bear pleasure. #feminism.

170
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,760
Exactly.
Time.com once even ran the headline:

171
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,600
"scientists say smelling farts
might prevent cancer",

172
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,720
which I would say was the most
unfortunate thing Time ever published,

173
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,480
but this is a magazine
that once did a cover story

174
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,680
on "Those Asian-American
Whiz Kids".

175
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,880
There are now so many
studies being thrown around,

176
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,280
they can seem
to contradict one another.

177
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,440
In the last few months,
we've seen studies about coffee

178
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,520
that claim it may reverse
the effects of liver damage,

179
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,840
help prevent colon cancer, decrease
the risk of endometrial cancer,

180
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,240
and increase
the risk of miscarriage.

181
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,480
Coffee today is like God
in the Old Testament:

182
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,600
it will either save you
or kill you

183
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,720
depending on how much
you believe in its magic powers.

184
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,040
And after a point, all that ridiculous
information can make you wonder...

185
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,600
Is science bullshit ?
To which the answer is clearly "no".

186
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,840
But there is a lot of bullshit
currently masquerading as science.

187
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,480
So tonight, we thought we'd talk
about a few of the reasons why.

188
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,480
And first:
not all scientific studies are equal.

189
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,880
Some appear in less-than-legitimate
scientific journals.

190
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,680
Others may be subtly biased
because of scientists

191
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,960
feeling pressured to come up
with eye-catching results.

192
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,480
My success as a scientist depends
on me publishing my findings

193
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,920
I need to publish frequently
in the most prestigious outlets.

194
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,200
Scientists are under constant
pressure to publish,

195
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,320
with tenure and funding
on the line.

196
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,520
To get published, it helps to have
results that seem new and striking.

197
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,760
Scientists know nobody
is publishing a study that says:

198
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,720
"nothing up with acai berries".

199
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,400
To get those results, there are all
sorts of ways that consciously or not,

200
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,720
you can tweak your study,
you could alter how long it lasts,

201
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,840
or make your random sample
too small to be reliable,

202
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,960
or engage in something
scientists call p-hacking.

203
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,960
That's phacking with a hyphen,
not to be confused with "phacking",

204
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,000
which is a euphemism
for fucking the Philly Phanatic.

205
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,400
P-hacking is very complicated.
It means collecting lots of variables

206
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,240
and then playing with your data
until you find something that counts

207
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,800
as "statistically significant",
but is probably meaningless.

208
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,080
The web site FiveThirtyEight
surveyed 54 people

209
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,120
and collected over 1 000 variables,
and through p-hacking the results,

210
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,440
was able to find statistically
significant correlations

211
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,720
between eating cabbage
and having an innie bellybutton,

212
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,000
drinking iced tea - believing "Crash"
didn't deserve to win "Best Picture",

213
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,000
and eating raw tomatoes
and Judaism.

214
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,440
And the only thing tomatoes
have in common with Judaism

215
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,400
is that neither of them really feel
quite at home in the Upper Midwest.

216
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,360
But you don't even need to engage
in these kinds of manipulations

217
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,440
to get results that don't hold up.

218
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,880
Even the best designed studies
can get flukish results.

219
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,360
The best process science has to guard
against that is the replication study,

220
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,960
where other scientists re-do your study
and see if they get similar results.

221
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,280
Unfortunately, that happens
way less than it should.

222
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,720
Replication studies are rarely funded
and they're so underappreciated.

223
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,960
They never get published.
No one wants to do them.

224
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,200
There's no reward system
that enables it to happen.

225
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,840
So you just have all of these
exploratory studies out there

226
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,360
that are taken as fact.

227
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,680
That this is a scientific fact
that's never been confirmed.

228
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,960
No reward for being the second
to discover something in science.

229
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,720
There's no Nobel Prize
for fact-checking.

230
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,400
"There's no Nobel Prize
for fact-checking"

231
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,920
is a poster in Brian Williams'
MSNBC dressing room.

232
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,760
For all those reasons,

233
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
scientists know not to attach
too much significance

234
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,600
to individual studies
until placed in the larger context

235
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,080
of all the work
taking place in that field.

236
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,640
But too often, a small study with
nuanced, tentative findings

237
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,160
gets blown out of proportion
when it's presented to the lay public.

238
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,600
That happens when a scientific
body puts out a press release

239
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,360
summarizing the study
for a wider audience.

240
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,440
A medical society hosted a conference
at which a paper was presented,

241
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,800
comparing the effects of flavanol
chocolate during pregnancy.

242
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,400
If that sounds narrow, and
technical, it was supposed to be,

243
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,000
there wasn't a control group
of women who didn't eat chocolate.

244
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,920
The study found "no difference
in preeclampsia"

245
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,680
"or high blood-pressure, between
women who ate the chocolates."

246
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,280
No way a study that boring can
make it to television, right ?

247
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,200
That medical society issued a press
release with the much sexier,

248
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,200
but a misleading title: "Benefits
of Chocolate During Pregnancy".

249
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,200
Because most TV producers just
read press releases, this happens:

250
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,520
If you're pregnant,
eating 30 grams a day of chocolate,

251
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,000
two-thirds of a chocolate bar,
not the whole chocolate bar,

252
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,240
could benefit the growth and
development of your baby,

253
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,960
especially in women at risk for
preeclampsia or high blood pressure.

254
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,720
Except that's not
what the study said.

255
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Like a game of telephone: substance
gets distorted at every step.

256
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,760
And I can only imagine how someone
must have described it the next day.

257
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,520
The news said our baby
is made of chocolate !

258
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,560
And it's okay if I eat it,
but only two-thirds.

259
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,640
And it is not like the media needs
help blowing things out of proportion.

260
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,880
Remember that Time story
about farts and cancer ?

261
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,600
The study never mentioned
either of those things.

262
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,080
It just pointed out that
certain sulfide compounds

263
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,440
"are useful pharmacological tools to
study mitochondrial dysfunction."

264
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,320
While that Time story was
later heavily corrected,

265
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,880
the scientists told us:
"we still get phone calls and emails"

266
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,520
"from 'strange' radio and TV shows
wanting us to talk about farts".

267
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,480
Which is a waste of their time.
They're doing valuable work.

268
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,360
They shouldn't be spending time
fielding calls from drive-time DJs

269
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,960
"Gas-Man and the Beef."

270
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,800
Some of this is on us,
the viewing audience.

271
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,800
We like fun, poppy science that
we can share like gossip,

272
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,120
and TV news producers
know it.

273
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,080
That is why you
constantly hear stuff like this:

274
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,040
Men, listen up !
A brand new study says

275
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,800
a woman is more open to romance
when full, opposed to being hungry.

276
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,120
Okay. First of all, no shit.

277
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,640
Anyone is more open to anything
when they aren't hungry.

278
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,960
That study involved only 20 women.

279
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,080
You cannot presume that twenty
women can speak for all women.

280
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,880
This is science,
not the United States Senate.

281
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,480
Then, there was this eye-catching
report from just last year:

282
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,160
A university in England says
drinking champagne weekly

283
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,600
may help delay dementia
and Alzheimer's.

284
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:25,880
1 to 3 glasses a week
can be effective for your health.

285
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,200
Fantastic news.

286
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,320
No, it isn't. Because
there's a big issue with that study,

287
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,640
if you are celebrating with
champagne three times a week,

288
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,080
your standards for celebration
need to be much higher.

289
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,200
Champagne is acceptable
on New Years', Valentine's,

290
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,800
birthdays, and if and when
Henry Kissinger dies, and that's it.

291
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,160
That is the full list.
That study was performed on rats.

292
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,880
And how do you
not tell people that ?

293
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,880
And how do you not also show
them photos of the experiments ?

294
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,640
You'd think they would have
paired it with some cheese,

295
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,320
but they went with cocaine.

296
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,360
God, that's chic.
Those are chic rats !

297
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,200
It's not the drugs that make
them cool. It's their confidence.

298
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,480
While studies performed on rats and
mice are undeniably useful,

299
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,200
their applicability to humans
can be limited.

300
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,640
The majority of treatments
that work on lab mice

301
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,320
do not wind up
succeeding in humans.

302
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,120
Which means: A) we shouldn't rush
out to report rodent results,

303
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,520
and B) during lab mouse funerals,

304
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,560
when they say: "he didn't die in vain",
most of the time, they are lying.

305
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,440
I know it hurts to hear that,
but them's the breaks, mouse.

306
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,680
Now to be fair,
it's not always the news media.

307
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,120
Sometimes, researchers
will oversimplify the science.

308
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,200
Even TED Talks, which have
had some amazing speakers,

309
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,520
have also featured some
morning-showstyle science in the past.

310
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,120
Like Paul Zak's 2011 talk

311
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,080
on a hormone produced
in the brain called oxytocin,

312
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,480
which he even gave
a catchy name to.

313
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,960
This little syringe contains
the moral molecule.

314
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,720
It's so easy to cause people's
brains to release oxytocin.

315
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,800
I know how to do it, and my favorite
way to do it is the easiest.

316
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,280
Here, give me a hug.
There you go.

317
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,400
Here's your prescription from
Dr. Love. Eight hugs a day.

318
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,920
We have found that people who
release more oxytocin are happier.

319
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,840
Because they have better
relationships of all types.

320
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,200
Dr. Love says eight hugs a day.

321
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,640
First of all, don't call yourself
"Dr. Love", that's the nickname

322
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,400
a tabloid gives a dentist who
ejaculated on his sedated patients.

323
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,880
Second: there is no way that I would
be happier giving eight hugs a day.

324
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm English. That is four
lifetimes worth of hugs !

325
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,120
By now, you won't be
surprised to learn,

326
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,080
the real science on oxytocin

327
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,080
is more complicated than the term
"moral molecule" suggests.

328
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,480
While it has been found
to enhance positive emotions,

329
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,360
researchers have also found

330
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,360
that it can enhance negative emotions
like envy and bias.

331
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,120
The science on this is still very
much in progress.

332
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,840
Which explains why a survey
of oxytocin research warned,

333
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,720
the reports about it influencing
a large number of social behaviors

334
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
should be viewed with skepticism.

335
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,840
Which is really a long, technical
way of saying what you knew,

336
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,960
which is: when a strange man
calling himself Dr. Love

337
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,520
offers to hug you eight times
a day, say no.

338
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,160
You can see just about all of
the problems that I've described

339
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,960
plus one more, in a study that
made the rounds last year.

340
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,120
Driving while dehydrated is just as
dangerous as driving drunk.

341
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,560
Researchers say drivers who drank
one ounce of water per hour

342
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,480
made the same mistakes as those
over the legal limit with alcohol.

343
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,800
Doctor, when I heard this,
I thought, this cannot be true.

344
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,960
Yeah, obviously it couldn't,
because it wasn't true.

345
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,440
Britain's National Health Service
pointed out,

346
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,800
that study was riddled
with red flags,

347
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,480
including that it was based
on just twelve men,

348
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,960
of whom data
was only reported for eleven,

349
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,720
and it got funding from
the European Hydration Institute,

350
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,520
a foundation that has received over
seven million dollars from Coca Cola,

351
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,520
a company that just
happens to sell re-hydration,

352
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,040
in the form of fizzy brown sugar
water, carbonated urine,

353
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:49,000
flat urine, diet urine, and grapefruit
flavored embalming fluid.

354
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:56,360
Because a study is industry-funded,
or it was done on mice,

355
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,000
doesn't mean it's flawed.

356
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,520
But it is something the media
reporting on it should tell you about.

357
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,280
And you may think:
"Where's the harm here ?"

358
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,880
So long as I don't try to fart cancer
away, or fellate a bear,

359
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,360
no one's getting hurt.

360
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,000
But I'm not so sure about that.
'Cause think of it this way:

361
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,600
this is a chart of studies
of things like coffee, eggs, and wine.

362
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,520
All of them have been linked

363
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,480
to raising or lowering your risk of
cancer, depending on the study.

364
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:31,200
And "everything causes cancer" is
not the conclusion you want to draw.

365
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,440
You should draw it from logging on
to Web MD, that is their motto.

366
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,600
If I were to tell you about each
of those studies in isolation,

367
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,480
at some point, you might think:

368
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,440
"No one knows anything
about what causes cancer."

369
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,080
And that is a problem,

370
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,880
because that's the sort of thing that
enabled tobacco companies,

371
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,080
to insist
"the science isn't in yet".

372
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,160
And if you think I'm exaggerating
about the impact this misreporting

373
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,160
can have on our faith in science,
look at an example

374
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,560
from some of the people
most guilty of it.

375
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,120
Because the Today Show,
which lives for scientific studies,

376
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,840
recently concluded one segment
like this:

377
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,680
Like a lot of studies
that we love around here,

378
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:17,440
especially related to women,
about the benefits on whole milk.

379
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,160
There is a lot of research,
that says having whole milk

380
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,000
or having whole fat dairy products
can help you lose weight.

381
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,680
You find the study that sounds
best to you and go with that.

382
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,440
No !

383
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,520
In science, you don't just
get to cherry-pick the parts

384
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,680
that justify what you were
going to do anyway: that's religion.

385
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:54,320
That is what you're thinking of there.
And look, this is dangerous.

386
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,480
If we start
thinking science is a la carte,

387
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,080
and that if you don't like one
study, another will be along soon,

388
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,040
that is what leads people to think
man-made climate change isn't real,

389
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,920
or that vaccines cause autism

390
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,280
both of which the scientific
consensus is pretty clear on.

391
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:15,800
Science is by its nature imperfect.
But it is hugely important.

392
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,200
And it deserves better than to
be twisted out of proportion

393
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,840
and turned into gossip.

394
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,760
If they are going to keep
saying a study says,

395
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,960
they should have to provide sources
or context or not mention it at all.

396
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,720
I know what you're thinking:
"if that happens,"

397
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,960
"where am I going to get
all my interesting bull shit from ?"

398
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,040
Don't worry,
we have you covered !

399
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,160
Do you love science
in all its complexity,

400
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,040
but wish it could be a little less
complex and a lot less scientific ?

401
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,240
TODD Talks,
where the format of TED Talks

402
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,200
meets the intellectual rigor
of morning news shows.

403
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,360
Chocolate. It will kill you.

404
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:03,200
What if I were to tell you all that
the cure to racism is coffee ?

405
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,720
And in my research I found out
red wine makes babies

406
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,680
twenty percent more sociable,
that's a baby we can work with !

407
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,280
At TODD Talks, we've raised
the bar on entertainment

408
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,080
by lowering the bar
on what constitutes science.

409
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,760
Scientists at the Skittles Foundation
for Rainbow Tasting

410
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,680
have done some pioneering work.

411
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,600
We placed 37 volunteers
from Tulsa, Oklahoma

412
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,800
on an all Skittle diet for six weeks,

413
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,640
and guess how many
were killed by baboons ?

414
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,840
One ! Thirty-four people lived.

415
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,920
Two were killed in a non-baboon
related murder-suicide.

416
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,360
Why do we do this ?
Because you love science,

417
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,680
but you don't want to hear its process
depicted on a stage.

418
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,600
I conducted a trial on the effects
of coffee on cancer of the esophagus.

419
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:58,680
While there was significant decreases
in incidences of cancer in the mice,

420
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,160
any conclusions will
have to await human trials,

421
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,040
peer review and replication.

422
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:09,960
I think what he's trying
to say is coffee cures cancer ! Yes !

423
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,880
We finally did it !
Coffee cures cancer !

424
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,560
You won't find our
speakers at TED Talks,

425
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,640
because they're not afraid
to ask the hard questions.

426
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,680
Are eggs good for you ?
Or are they bad for you ?

427
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,120
What if I were to tell you
they were both ?

428
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,120
What if I were to tell you
they were neither ?

429
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,000
What if I were to tell you they
were both and neither !? Yes !

430
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:43,360
TODD Talks feature the scientific
insights that are incredible.

431
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,440
Stand butt-to-butt with me.

432
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,000
By standing butt-to-butt, we can
increase our serotonin levels.

433
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,560
- How do you feel ?
- Weird ?

434
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:58,680
That's the serotonin working.
I'm gonna give you a boost.

435
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,720
How does that feel ?
She's speechless !

436
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,240
If you like the idea of science,
you'll absolutely love TODD Talks.

437
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,880
None of what you're hearing
here is science.

438
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,840
Science is a rigorous process
that does not lend itself easily

439
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,560
to sweeping conclusions.

440
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,440
Take it easy, pal.
Somebody needs a serotonin boost.

441
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,120
Come on, bring it in !

442
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,200
TODD Talks have been called
insightful, inspiring

443
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,600
and a clear trademark infringement.

444
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,400
I'm not even a scientist.
But my study shows

445
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:38,320
that you seem 70% more authoritative
if you're wearing a lab coat.

446
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,240
And I am !
Thank you so much !

447
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,960
Not a scientist ! There you go !

448
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,040
Thank you so much. It's been fun !
I'm not a scientist !

449
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,080
TODD Talks. Because science doesn't
have to be an exact science.

450
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,280
That's our show !
We'll be back next week. Good night !

451
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:16,600
What if I told you that
the cure to racism was coffee ?

452
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,080
Not tea. Don't drink tea.
That'll make it worse.

453
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,840
One out of thirty seven. What are
the odds ? We'll never know.

454
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,040
Good, bad, neither, both !
Science !

455
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,320
Science is an egg !

456
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,920
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

457
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
END OF EPISODE 11,
SEASON III
