00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,320
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,480
SEASON III
EPISODE 17

3
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,280
Welcome to Last Week Tonight  !

4
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,440
I'm John Oliver.
Thanks you so much for joining us.

5
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,880
And let us begin straight away
with the United Kingdom.

6
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,760
A place whose very name,
after this week's events,

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,960
is beginning to sound
a bit sarcastic.

8
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,840
Because the UK this week
voted to leave the European Union,

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,040
a decision
that has shaken the world.

10
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,560
And not in a Muhammad-Ali-
beating-Sonny-Liston kind of way,

11
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,600
more in a those-Ikea-meatballs-
you-love-contain-horse kind of way.

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,080
And the fallout in Britain
has been swift and significant.

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,800
The Brexit decision is off to a bit of
a rough start here in London, at least.

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,040
Stocks were in free fall.
The pound historically weak

15
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,440
and the country's in the market
for a new prime minister.

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,800
That's right: David Cameron
announced he would be stepping down

17
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,120
in the wake of the vote.

18
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,800
Which should make me happy
but in this situation, it doesn't.

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,520
It's like catching an ice cream cone
out of the air

20
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,480
because a child was hit by a car.

21
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,080
I mean, I'll eat it,
but it's tainted somehow.

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,960
And before, before you have
any sympathy for David Cameron,

23
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,520
you should know this whole vote
was his idea in the first place.

24
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,080
We will give the British people
a referendum with in or out choice.

25
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Yes, Cameron proposed
the in or out choice himself,

26
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,760
which he does only when he's deciding
whether to fuck a pig's mouth.

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,320
And meanwhile, the Brexit vote has
boosted its two most vocal backers:

28
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,560
Nigel Farage, leader of the UK
Independence Party

29
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,960
and three time cover model
for "Punchable Face" magazine,

30
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,680
and Boris Johnson, a shaved
orangutan with Owen Wilson's hair.

31
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,480
And before and after the vote, both
men drove home a common theme.

32
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,040
I believe that this Thursday
can be our country's Independence Day.

33
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,360
Let June the 23rd go down in our
history as our Independence Day.

34
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,240
Okay, just, a couple of things there:
first, Britain was already independent !

35
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,720
It's what many other countries
celebrate their independence from !

36
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,600
And second, the sequel
to the movie they're quoting

37
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,960
opened this week, and features
the wholesale destruction of London,

38
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,840
which is beginning to feel pretty
fucking appropriate right now.

39
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,240
I'm not even sure the pro-Brexit
camp had planned on winning.

40
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,680
The next day, they started speaking
more carefully about their promises.

41
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,480
You might remember
that campaign bus, which read,

42
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,880
"We send the EU
350 million pounds a week,

43
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,680
let's fund our
National Health Service instead" ?

44
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,400
Here's Nigel Farage
the morning after the vote.

45
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,760
The 350 million pounds a week
we send to the EU,

46
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,000
which we will no
longer send to the EU,

47
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,160
can you guarantee
that's going to go to the NHS ?

48
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,680
No I can't, and I would never
have made that claim...

49
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,760
Now you're telling us !

50
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,600
But, it does seem that Farage will
not correct factual mistakes on buses.

51
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,280
I therefore would encourage Britain
to take out bus ads reading,

52
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,400
Nigel Farage has spent hours trying
to put his own penis in his asshole.

53
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,480
I presume he'll be silent about it.

54
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,880
And while the benefits of a Brexit
may well have been exaggerated,

55
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,040
the downsides could be all too real.

56
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,120
Prominent figures in Scotland
and Northern Ireland

57
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,840
are advocating for rejoining the EU.

58
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,520
Meanwhile, the EU
is understandably worried

59
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,520
about other member nations
making exits of their own,

60
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,080
so it may negotiate as hard as possible
to make an example of Britain.

61
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,240
Basically, it seems like whoever the
next UK prime minister is going to be,

62
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,480
whether it's Boris Johnson,
or a racist teakettle,

63
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,920
they are going to be in
for a rough few years.

64
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,640
Once they invoke
what's known as Article 50,

65
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,480
they have two years
to negotiate their withdrawal

66
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,840
and future relationship
with the EU.

67
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,000
They'll have to settle
outstanding bills with the EU,

68
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,960
hammer out new trade deals
with dozens of countries,

69
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,760
sift through thousands of regulations,
decide which ones to keep,

70
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,000
and figure out how migration
will work.

71
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,680
And all the while,
lives hang in the balance.

72
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,320
Take this Portuguese woman,

73
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,600
who has lived in the UK for years,
and has built a life there.

74
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,920
I have two daughters.

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,400
One was born in Portugal,
the second one was born in UK.

76
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,040
And asked me this morning, Mom,
what is going to happen to us ?

77
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,880
And I told them,
at this point, no one knows.

78
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,320
I don't know how to explain my children
what's going to happen to their future.

79
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,640
Perhaps I can help you with that.
Tell them they might be screwed,

80
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,040
because a pig fucker called for a vote,
a bus had some bullshit written on it,

81
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,160
and then two idiots named Nigel and
Boris quoted President Bill Pullman.

82
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,080
They'll get it.
They'll totally understand.

83
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,600
It's hard not to think that some Britons
may not have fully thought this through,

84
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,720
especially when you look
at some of the top search terms

85
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,680
concerning the EU the next day...

86
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,120
Some of the most Googled questions
in the UK since the polls closed...

87
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,080
"What does it mean to leave the EU ?"
and "What is the EU ?"

88
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,160
Okay, that is clearly not good.

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,840
On the list of all-time bad
morningafter Googles,

90
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,680
that's got to be up there with:
"Can I get pregnant from mouth stuff ?"

91
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,840
and "what is a swastika and also
how do you remove a tattoo ?"

92
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,160
At least one person who voted to leave
seems to have buyer's remorse.

93
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,240
I was very disappointed
about the results.

94
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,960
Even though I voted to leave,

95
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,160
this morning, I woke up
and the reality did actually hit me.

96
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,800
But if I had the opportunity
to vote again, it would be to stay.

97
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,400
You're actually in luck,
because it turns out, incredibly,

98
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,800
there is going to be
another vote coming up

99
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,960
and it's happening one week from...

100
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,880
Of course there isn't,
that was the fucking vote.

101
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,880
It wasn't a practice round !
That was it !

102
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,560
And as if it couldn't get any worse,

103
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,160
as the full impact of what Britain
had just done was sinking in,

104
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,600
Donald Trump turned up in Scotland
to promote his fucking golf course.

105
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,480
When he was asked about whether he,
the presumptive Republican nominee,

106
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,880
had any thoughts on the seismic events
unfolding in Europe,

107
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,320
this was his response.

108
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,320
I think it's going to end up
being a great thing

109
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,240
and the beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful thing is,

110
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,320
your people have taken
the country back.

111
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,600
There's something very nice about that.
And they voted and it's been peaceful.

112
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,000
And it was strong and very contentious
and, in many respects,

113
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,600
I watched last night,
it was a little bit ugly.

114
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,000
But it's been
an amazing process to watch.

115
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,480
He just said absolutely nothing.
Because, let me explain.

116
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,120
First he said a Brexit will end up
being great which it very likely won't.

117
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,560
Then he said the word "beautiful"
3 times.

118
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,640
Then he said "your people"
have taken the country back,

119
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,160
even though he was in Scotland,
which voted to remain in the EU.

120
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,200
Then he said, "it's been peaceful",
which it hasn't.

121
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,400
Then he contradicted himself by saying
it's been "contentious" and "ugly."

122
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,240
And then he summed
the whole thing up as "amazing".

123
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,640
Now, if he had simply breathed
audibly into the microphone,

124
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,080
the same amount of information
would have been conveyed.

125
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,440
Then he found a way to make
this thing about himself, tweeting:

126
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,480
"Many people are equating Brexit,
and what is going on in Great Britain,

127
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,200
with what is happening in the US.
People want their country back !"

128
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,200
And you might think:

129
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,200
"We're not going to listen
to some ridiculously-haired buffoon,

130
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,480
peddling lies and nativism in the hopes
of riding a protest vote into power."

131
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,880
Well, let Britain tell you:
it can happen, and when it does,

132
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,800
there are no fucking do-overs.

133
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,760
And now, this...

134
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,880
And now, the things
news anchors are scared of.

135
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,320
I'm a little terrified of clowns.

136
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,080
- I have a fear of flying.
- I'm afraid of drowning.

137
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,520
I'm scared of computers.

138
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,520
Nuns were raising me.
So I have a fear of penguins.

139
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,320
Number one fear is elevators.

140
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,760
I have a fear of two things,
mice and heights.

141
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,120
Sharks, I am terrified of them.

142
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,000
As a kid I had,
I was terrified of, of quicksand.

143
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,440
- I have a fear of the snooze.
- I have a fear of losing gift cards.

144
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,960
I have a phobia of being tickled.

145
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,840
- Are you scared of cats ?
- I'm afraid of adult cats.

146
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,200
Everything I'm reading in this
prompter terrifies me.

147
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,080
Moving on.

148
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,800
Our main story tonight
concerns the Olympics.

149
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,560
Otherwise known as "your
biennial reminder that NBC exists".

150
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,880
The Rio games
are just around the corner,

151
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,360
so get ready for plenty of sappy
athlete profiles like these.

152
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,000
Torie Bowie is a sprinter climbing
her way to the top.

153
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,240
Her success exceeds far beyond the
field she started on in high school.

154
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,000
At his childhood pool,

155
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,760
there's still a bench where he was
forced to sit and take time outs.

156
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,680
But what others struggle
to contain in daily life,

157
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,240
Phelps put to full purpose
when there was something on the line.

158
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,720
Burroughs is powered by the elemental
truth of the sport that fills his dreams.

159
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,240
Yes !

160
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,520
Those videos aren't just uplifting,
that's basically inspiration porn.

161
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,200
That's what a fireworks display
watches when it wants to jerk off.

162
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,440
While the Olympics feature thrilling
displays of athletic prowess,

163
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,600
they can also take place beneath the
dark shadow cast by doping scandals.

164
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,680
And this Olympics is no exception.

165
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,640
According to a report that reads
like a Cold War spy thriller,

166
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,000
Russian secret agents
and a mysterious Moscow laboratory

167
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,480
were used for statesanctioned doping.

168
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,560
A Russian athlete and trainer

169
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,560
secretly filmed drugs
being handed out like candy.

170
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,760
Russia accused of using
its security services, its new KGB,

171
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,240
to tamper with supposedly
tamper-proof bottles,

172
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,120
allegedly using this hole in the
laboratory wall to switch samples.

173
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,160
It's true. A Russian lab
used a secret hole in the wall

174
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,280
in an attempt
to win Olympic medals

175
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,560
making this the first known example
of a literal glory hole.

176
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,640
And, just listen to how the athletes
ingested some of the drugs.

177
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,400
Rodchenkov's cocktails of 3 different
performance-enhancing drugs were,

178
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,960
on his instructions,
washed down by athletes with alcohol

179
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,040
to shorten the detection period.

180
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,440
Chivas for male athletes,
vermouth for the ladies.

181
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,360
Wait, vermouth for the ladies ?
I get doping is still going on,

182
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,800
but I'd hoped that unnecessarily
gendered illegal products

183
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,800
died out with the Virginia Slims
crack pipe.

184
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,760
Hashtag feminism.
Hashtag crackpipes.

185
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,520
Russia's track and field team

186
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,040
is currently banned from competing
at the upcoming Olympics.

187
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,520
But there is nothing new.
For as long as there has been science,

188
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,960
people have used it
to juice the human body.

189
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,520
In the 1920's,
a Russian-born French surgeon

190
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,000
grafted thin slices of chimp testicles
into people's scrotums.

191
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,960
Which was obviously ridiculous.

192
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,400
These days, we know you need
a thick slice of chimp testicles.

193
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,240
That's when it starts to work.

194
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,640
And there's a long history
of athletes circumventing the rules.

195
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,440
In the 1904 Olympics,
one of the marathon runners

196
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,600
rode 11 miles in a car,
a move that takes balls so big,

197
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,760
they must've included
a massive slice of chimp nuts.

198
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,680
Now, as for the modern era,
while no one knows exactly

199
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,800
how many athletes dope,
there are some shocking hints.

200
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,960
One leaked survey found
that "an estimated 29 percent

201
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,440
of trackand-field athletes
at the 2011 world championships

202
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,880
said that they had doped
in the past year.

203
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,520
And presumably, that doesn't
even include roided-out athletes

204
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,400
who responded by yelling
"survey make me angry !",

205
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,960
crumpling it up,
and throwing it to the moon.

206
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,600
But the prevalence of doping
is a little surprising,

207
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,520
when you consider how rigorous the
testing regimes in top sport can be.

208
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,560
Watch what happens to one runner
seconds after she crosses finish line.

209
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,760
From now, until she's able to provide
a sample, two things will be constant:

210
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,120
water and Flanagan's
anti-doping chaperone.

211
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,000
The chaperone makes sure
the athlete doesn't try to cheat.

212
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,720
It's a bigtime buzz kill.

213
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,480
'Cause you're really excited
and you want to enjoy the moment,

214
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,440
but you've got to get focused
and get ready to pee.

215
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,400
Now, that, that's got to be tough.

216
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,200
'Cause you're probably
not ready to pee on command.

217
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,600
That's not what your body
is prepared to do at that moment.

218
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,160
It's like asking someone

219
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,680
to have an orgasm in the middle
of test-driving a Nissan Cube.

220
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,480
It's not going to be easy.
That could take a while.

221
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,840
If you think
it's no fun for the athletes,

222
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,200
it's not much fun
for the testers either.

223
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,280
Real Sports followed one of them
on a surprise out-of-competition test.

224
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,480
His task this early Saturday morning

225
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,360
is to collect a sample from
an elite rower named Alex Zosuls.

226
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,400
Alex agreed to let us film
the moment of truth.

227
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,480
Lowell is required to witness
and have an unobstructed view.

228
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,960
My God !

229
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:16,800
It's the face of a man reconsidering
every single decision he has made,

230
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,640
while also wishing that athlete
had not had asparagus for dinner.

231
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,640
Despite rigorous testing, athletes
are slipping through the cracks.

232
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,240
For a start, there are multiple tests
and none of them can detect

233
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,880
the full range of drugs
an athlete might be on,

234
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,600
from anabolic steroids, to EPO,
to human growth hormone,

235
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,560
to the most powerful
drug of all: love.

236
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,680
Testing it's less black-and-white
than you might assume.

237
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,600
There are wide variations
in biochemistry,

238
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,800
so to avoid false positives, testing
thresholds are deliberately high.

239
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,560
And athletes can dope, and
still come below those thresholds,

240
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,480
by doing things like "microdosing"
or using masking agents.

241
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,200
Those are some ways that it's
possible for top athletes to cheat,

242
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,840
while still being able
to say things like this.

243
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,040
People are smart. Do they say:
has Armstrong ever tested positive ?

244
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,840
No. Has Lance Armstrong
been tested ? A lot.

245
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,880
That is some confident lying.
Which isn't surprising.

246
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
This is a man who looked America
in the eyes and said:

247
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,880
"bicycling is a very cool sport"
and we fucking believed him.

248
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:38,280
The techniques athletes used to beat
the system have been imaginative.

249
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,960
European cyclists inserted condoms
of clean urine into their anus.

250
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,320
In order to conceal everything
would cover it

251
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,440
with "fake hair blending into
the real hair of the nether regions".

252
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,200
And you have to imagine that
to convince a cyclist to do that,

253
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,640
a coach would need to deliver
the most inspirational speech.

254
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,000
Do you want to be a champion ?!
Then you jam in that piss balloon,

255
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,120
pick up that hot glue gun,
slap on that anus merkin

256
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,680
and ride like a champion !

257
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,880
Full anus, clear tests, can't lose !
Get out there and ride !

258
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,640
When they have tested positive,
excuses have been more imaginative.

259
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,680
Dennis Mitchell insisted
his positive test for testosterone

260
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,640
was the result of having sex
at least four times the night before

261
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,080
and drinking five bottles of beer,
and if that is what your life is like,

262
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,480
you don't really need
the Olympics.

263
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,400
Other athletes
have blamed positive tests

264
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,000
on eating a pie made from
doped-up racing pigeons,

265
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,960
or eating a stew of meat and
organs from un-castrated boars.

266
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,960
If Wheaties is really
the breakfast of champions,

267
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,200
their ingredient list will now include
pigeon meat and pig-jizz.

268
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,880
None of that beats
my favorite excuse of all time.

269
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:09,160
Hamilton explained why somebody
else's blood was in his veins.

270
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,120
He clamed a vanished twin absorbed
by his body in the womb.

271
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,920
The court didn't buy it.

272
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,360
But that twin isn't vanished.
It's me.

273
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,880
I'm your brother, Tyler.
And my name isn't John Oliver.

274
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:31,120
It's Skyler Hamilton. And together we
are Skyler and Tyler Hamilton,

275
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,960
a pair of un-vanished twins.

276
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,080
We're both equally
good at biking.

277
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,840
In a way, you can see why athletes
might want to dope.

278
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,240
A split-second advantage
can make the difference.

279
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,520
There's a lot of money on the line.
There is a massive financial ecosystem

280
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,920
dependent on spectacular athletic
achievement in scandal-free games.

281
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,080
And that includes the networks,
who reap over a billion in ad sales,

282
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,400
the IOC, which reaps billions
in broadcast rights,

283
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,800
and sponsors who love using
Olympic athletes for ads like these.

284
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,120
To perform your best, training's
got to be a lifelong passion.

285
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,960
Fueled by a foot-long passion.

286
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,360
That's why Debbie Phelps
is always there for her son Michael,

287
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,120
with his favorite
fully jacked, foot-long subs.

288
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,880
Stop, no professional swimmer
wants a sandwich in the pool.

289
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,040
There is nothing more
viscerally upsetting

290
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,200
than a woman feeding her wet
nearly naked adult son

291
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,120
something called
a "fully jacked foot-long".

292
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:48,040
When you combine all the money
incentivizing athletes to get an edge,

293
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,200
with all the imperfections of tests,

294
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,840
you would hope there'd be a robust
monitoring system in place.

295
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,800
Some countries lack the resources
for testing, others lack the desire.

296
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,880
To get a sense of how compromised
the system can become,

297
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,280
let's go back
to what happened in Russia.

298
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,920
Here's how things worked. This is
a Russian track-and-field athlete.

299
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,560
He would compete for his national
sports federation, ARAF.

300
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,800
That federation would be under both
the body governing track and field,

301
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,960
the IAAF, and the Ministry of Sport,
part of the Russian government.

302
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,120
He would be tested
by his country's anti-doping agency,

303
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,880
send it to a laboratory accredited
by the World Anti-Doping Agency,

304
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,720
which receives funding from
the IOC and countries like Russia.

305
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,760
You can see this system
looks like a sprawling mess.

306
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,000
Technically, it could work,

307
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,120
if each step was committed
to stamping out doping.

308
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,040
You've seen that that one lab
had a glory hole,

309
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,960
and on top of that,
a recent investigation found

310
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,200
that RUSADA officers
accepted bribes from athletes

311
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,400
and gave them advance notice
of when they'd be tested.

312
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,280
The former head of ARAF worked with
the director of that glory-hole lab

313
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,400
to conceal positive drug tests
and while you would hope

314
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,040
the IAAF would have been
rooting all this out,

315
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,000
the head of their anti-doping
department was banned

316
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,880
for five years
after an ethics investigation.

317
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,200
At which point, this is all actually
making FIFA look good !

318
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:28,560
Fucking FIFA.
And they are basically just the mafia,

319
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,640
with slightly better branding.

320
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,320
There is WADA. They are supposed
to help prevent things like this.

321
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,160
Their investigation
got off to a rocky start.

322
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,720
We only have all this information
thanks to a whistleblower,

323
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,040
a former RUSADA employee
named Vitaly Stepanov.

324
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,200
He approached WADA with
a great deal of information,

325
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,480
but their response
was not reassuring.

326
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,240
He sent 200 e-mails and 50 letters
detailing what he had witnessed.

327
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:01,960
WADA told him it did not have the
power to investigate inside Russia.

328
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,440
At that point, WADA didn't
have the explicit authority.

329
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:11,360
That's a bit weird in and of itself.
Don't want the global antidrug agency

330
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,320
to have the authority
of mall cops.

331
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,360
Thief ! Stop or I'll be forced to...
Go straight to the food court

332
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,680
and grumble about your behavior into
a bag of Wetzel's Pretzels Cin-a-Bitz.

333
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,600
And while WADA
now has more authority,

334
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,880
and has appointed a commission
to investigate the Russia scandal,

335
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,800
their head, Craig Reedie,
sent a weirdly cozy e-mail

336
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,880
to an adviser to the Russian
sports minister, saying:

337
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,880
"on a personal level I value the
relationship I have with the minister"

338
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,240
"and there is no intention in WADA
to affect that relationship."

339
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,280
An unsettlingly chummy tone
for a regulator to take.

340
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,360
If Tom Colicchio promised
to judge Top Chef fairly,

341
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,240
but then said to one contestant:
"I value my relationship with you"

342
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,400
"and will do nothing to affect it",
the other contestants would think:

343
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,280
"This is clearly pointless, here's
a Hot Pocket, go fuck yourself."

344
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,800
And at this point, I'm supposed
to tell you that Russian officials

345
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,480
and the former head of ARAF
denied all these accusations.

346
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,240
Reedie says he's done nothing to
interfere with the investigations.

347
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,520
And his email had been misconstrued.
And, you know... Sure.

348
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,040
While this clearly
isn't the system we need,

349
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,560
it might actually be
the system we want.

350
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,240
Just listen to former head of WADA,
the phenomenally named Dick Pound,

351
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,280
who has a depressing theory

352
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,800
about why more dopers
aren't caught.

353
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,360
The machinery is all there.
Do people really want it to work ?

354
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,760
You can do hundreds of thousands
of tests

355
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,000
and then catch nobody if you
don't want to catch anybody.

356
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,680
- Is that what is happening ?
- People don't want it to work.

357
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,960
Dick Pound should insist that everyone
call him "Rick" or "Rich"

358
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,480
if he really wants
anyone to fully listen to him.

359
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,240
He wrote a report for WADA,
assessing the state of drug testing,

360
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,080
which found, among
the broader sports community:

361
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,920
there is no general appetite
to undertake the effort and expense

362
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,280
to deliver doping-free sport.

363
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,600
Which is pretty alarming.
We're treating good testing

364
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,120
like calorie counts
on restaurant menus.

365
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,400
Everyone might say they want it,

366
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,160
until they find out one Bloomin' Onion
is 32 million calories.

367
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,120
And then they are fucking done.

368
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,640
You might think: "why don't we
just let everyone dope ?"

369
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,120
That is not the answer.
That could be very dangerous,

370
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,680
athletes tempted to take greater
amounts to get that split-second edge.

371
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,600
And it could also potentially force
clean athletes to dope

372
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,800
at which point, you've
destroyed the integrity of sport.

373
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,160
If you wanna know what it's like
against an enhanced athlete

374
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,680
listen to Alysia Montano.

375
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,680
She lost at the 2012 Olympics
to Mariya Savinova,

376
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,120
a Russian athlete implicated
in the current doping scandal.

377
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,480
This was the first time Montano
allowed herself to watch the race

378
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,640
she lost to gold
medalist Mariya Savinova.

379
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,120
Montano had led the race
for about 600 meters

380
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,840
before finishing fifth.

381
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,000
Savinova passed you
like you were...

382
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,320
Literally, standing still.
Yeah.

383
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,560
At that moment, I realized
I'm racing against robots.

384
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,880
- Robots ?
- Against robots.

385
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,880
She's racing against robots !
It wasn't just Savinova,

386
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,840
silver and bronze went to a Roomba
and a roided-out Teddy Ruxpin.

387
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:00,520
When she competed against those
same athletes the next year,

388
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,920
it was deja vu.

389
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,040
Savinova blew by her in the last
50 meters to finish second.

390
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,000
All Montano could do was throw
herself across the finish line,

391
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,600
beaten, and for the first time,
broken.

392
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,400
I felt failed and betrayed and
I felt like my career was a farce.

393
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,320
What am I doing out here ?
What's the point ?

394
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,000
"What am I doing here ?
What's the point ?"

395
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,240
She's a world-class athlete
and she was left feeling

396
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,520
like anyone who paid for a ticket
to "Now You See Me 2".

397
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,280
What are we doing here ?
What are any of us doing here ?

398
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,280
What's the point in this ?
What are we doing here ?

399
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,440
We've focused on Russia,
because the details are spectacular,

400
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,840
but they are far
from the only offenders.

401
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,600
Kenya, Jamaica and China
have all had doping scandals.

402
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,680
American athletes have cheated.
Justin Gatlin and Tyson Gay

403
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,240
have both been banned
for doping in the past,

404
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,880
yet they're still expected
to compete in Rio for the US team.

405
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,240
Think of doping like Putin ,
it's far from just a Russian problem,

406
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,640
it's something that adversely
affects the entire world.

407
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,640
So it feels like we have
two choices at this point:

408
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,200
if we truly want to clean up sports,
we should empower WADA

409
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,440
by making it independent
and put pressure on the sports system

410
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,400
to aggressively combat doping.

411
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,240
And if we don't really care
enough to make changes,

412
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,640
we should make our syrupy athlete
promos a bit more honest.

413
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,600
Ever since I was a kid,
I've loved to run.

414
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,680
My parents sometimes tell me
I could run before I could walk.

415
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,800
Which doesn't really make sense,
but I always believed them.

416
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,040
It's 5:00 and Olympic hopeful
Brandon Schmidt

417
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,280
has already been at the gym
for two hours with his coach.

418
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,400
Push it !

419
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,400
I've been working with Brandon
since he was eight.

420
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,320
I discovered him sprinting
across the playground.

421
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,720
That's how I used to find my runners.
Hang out at playgrounds,

422
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,720
look for the quickest kid,
can't do that anymore.

423
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,360
For Brandon, every morning,
it's the same routine.

424
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,360
First, I do cardio. Then, weights.

425
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,600
Then, just all the pills
I can cram into my mouth.

426
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,200
Push it.

427
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,280
Brandon's road
to Rio began years ago,

428
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,120
in a small bedroom
in Darbyville, Ohio.

429
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,280
When I was a kid, I had
posters of all my heroes:

430
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,760
Lance Armstrong, Marion Jones,
Ben Johnson, Mark McGwire

431
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,680
and that one guy who took a car
for 11 miles of an Olympic marathon.

432
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I wanted to be just like them.

433
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,600
From those modest beginnings,
Coach Jason Clark helped fill Brandon

434
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,800
with the stuff
winners are made of.

435
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,880
Your purples. We tried
pills containing everything:

436
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,640
cat dick, dog dick, lizard dick,
rhino dick, badger balls,

437
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,440
muskrat anuses, chipmunk
fists, moose face.

438
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,600
A 5-Hour Energy shot
straight into his eyeball.

439
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,160
I put a tampon full of jet fuel
up his ass. Push it !

440
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,000
I got Regis Philbin to scream into
a jar and then had him inhale 'em.

441
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,440
All of this just to get that edge.

442
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
But even the most prepared
athlete can get caught,

443
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,960
and Brandon relies on Coach
Clark's strict regimen of excuses.

444
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,640
Go !

445
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,240
I fell
in a vat of liquid amphetamines.

446
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,440
Next.

447
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,000
I was walking down this dark alley
and a guy stabbed me with EPO.

448
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,360
Sweeter !

449
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,760
- I ate my twin in the womb.
- I don't believe you.

450
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,120
An un-castrated boar
spit in my mouth.

451
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,880
Plausible. I like it.

452
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,520
I drank 5 beers and
fucked everyone in America.

453
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,080
- Time !
- How'd I do ?

454
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,360
You're ready.

455
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,040
Now, with his eyes
on Rio and Olympic gold,

456
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,080
Schmidt is hoping his years of
hard work will finally pay off.

457
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,320
For me, to win in Rio, that'd be a
fairytale come true, you know ?

458
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,920
It'd be a Cinderella story,

459
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,760
but like if the slipper
didn't belong to Cinderella

460
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,720
and she took drugs to change
the size of her foot to fit

461
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,640
and Prince Charming
fell for it.

462
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,360
And they lived happily ever after.

463
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,280
That's my dream.

464
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,920
That's our show,
thank you so much for watching.

465
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,040
We'll be back July 24th,
good night !

466
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,040
Push it !

467
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,240
Push it !

468
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,440
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

469
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,640
END OF EPISODE 17,
SEASON III
