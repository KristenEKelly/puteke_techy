00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:25,860
LAST WEEN TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,380
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight",
I'm John Oliver.

3
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:37,499
Thank you so much for joining us.
It has been a busy week.

4
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,139
Bongbong Marcos was elected
president of the Philippines,

5
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:42,539
we saw a pretty hot picture
of a black hole,

6
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,940
and the Eurovision Song Contest
took place,

7
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,459
featuring this spectacular entry
from Norway.

8
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:51,420
See where you're going
but I don't know where you've been.

9
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:54,899
Is that saliva or blood
dripping off your chin?

10
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,179
If you don't like the name Keith
I'mma call you, Jim.

11
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,899
And before that wolf eats my grandma,
give that wolf a banana,

12
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:08,179
give that wolf.

13
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,419
And before that wolf eats my grandma,
give that wolf a banana,

14
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,660
give that wolf.

15
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,660
Give that wolf. Banana.

16
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:23,459
Yes. Every part of that
gets a big yes from me.

17
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,339
From the dress code,

18
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,179
which can only be described
as "werewolf applying for a loan",

19
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,940
to the sexy business minion
backup dancers,

20
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,860
to the Fosse meets 2008
Gaga choreography,

21
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,179
to the lines "is that saliva
or blood dripping off your chin"

22
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,220
the horniest lyric since all of
"Montero", immediately followed by,

23
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,220
"If you don't like the name Keith,
I'mma call you Jim,"

24
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,979
which is pure chaos.

25
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:49,179
That band,
called Subwoolfer, by the way,

26
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,380
understood exactly
what Eurovision is for.

27
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:55,539
As incidentally did the Latvian entry,
which didn't even make it to the final,

28
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,780
despite having one of the best openings
to a song in the history of music.

29
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,539
Instead of meat,
I eat veggies and pussy.

30
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:12,019
I like them both fresh,
like them both juicy.

31
00:02:14,579 --> 00:02:17,500
Come on, are you not entertained?

32
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,660
The Eurovision song contest is absolute
mayhem, in all of the best ways.

33
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,940
But as much as I would love to spend
the next 10 minutes talking about that,

34
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:30,060
we sadly have to move on, especially
because this happened in Alabama.

35
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,180
The use of puberty blockers and
hormones to treat transgender minors

36
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:36,739
is now illegal in Alabama.

37
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:39,380
Yeah, the state's transgender youth
ban is now in effect,

38
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,340
and that means it is now a felony
for doctors to provide medications

39
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:46,220
to trans people
under the age of 19.

40
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:49,579
Alabama's the first state to enact
such a ban on these treatments.

41
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,940
It's punishable
by up to 10 years in prison.

42
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,500
That is absolutely appalling.

43
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:57,579
There are lots of understandable
reasons that someone in Alabama

44
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,380
might be criminally punished.

45
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,660
For murder, say,
or for running a Ponzi scheme,

46
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,819
or for creating this actual statue
at an Alabama McDonald's

47
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,460
of Ronald McDonald,
reimagined as a giant boll weevil.

48
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:11,139
But no one should ever be
facing criminal punishment

49
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,419
for providing healthcare
to young people.

50
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,100
This law was signed
by the state's governor, Kay Ivey,

51
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,340
a woman who, as you can see,
always looks like she's saying, "ham".

52
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,019
Here she is, again, saying "ham",

53
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,419
and here she is, mixing it up,
and saying "ham, y'all".

54
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:29,019
Ivey was deeply committed
to anti-trans legislation,

55
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,699
even making it a feature
of her reelection campaign.

56
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:33,940
Some things are just facts.

57
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:36,620
Summer's hot, the ocean's big,

58
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,380
and gender is a question of biology,
not identity.

59
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,299
Here in Alabama, we're gonna
go by how God made us,

60
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:49,900
because we identify with something
liberals never will: reality.

61
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,500
Okay, first, fuck you.

62
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:55,579
Second, "summer's hot,
ocean's big"

63
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,739
doesn't sound like the wind-up
to denying trans people their rights.

64
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:02,220
It sounds like a children's book
the author wrote while hungover.

65
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:03,979
"Summer's hot. Ocean's big,

66
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,419
I dunno, what more do you
fucking kids want from me?"

67
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:10,139
As for her point there that we have
to respect "how God made us".

68
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,660
Do we? Really? Why?

69
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:16,939
'Cause we've got too many holes,
way too little hair, and necks,

70
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,580
fragile lollipop bones,

71
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,460
that balance our dum-dum heads
in one very specific direction

72
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:22,700
or else we die.

73
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,939
None of this
is "intelligent design".

74
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,580
And while Alabama's
worst mee-maw

75
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,379
might appeal to "reality" there,
the truth is,

76
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,900
the major medical associations
oppose bans on gender-affirming care,

77
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:38,059
and with good reason,
because it saves lives,

78
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,340
and withdrawing it
can be incredibly harmful,

79
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:42,820
as this 15-year-old girl named Harleigh
will tell you.

80
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,499
If I did stop
my gender-affirming care,

81
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:50,619
my physical outside
wouldn't reflect on who I was inside.

82
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:56,619
And that would, like, completely
destroy me mentally and physically.

83
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,859
Okay. First off, Harleigh,
you seem great.

84
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,140
You're living your full, authentic self
with a level of confidence

85
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,419
that I did not have at 15,
or quite frankly, now.

86
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:09,379
Now, as for Governor Ivey,
if you can look at Harleigh,

87
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,499
or any child,
and comfortably say,

88
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,419
"Take away the care that gives them
peace and a sense of self,"

89
00:05:14,499 --> 00:05:16,379
you are a bad person.

90
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,700
The only good thing you could
possibly bring into this world

91
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,179
is if you were played by beloved
character actress Margo Martindale

92
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,580
in a limited series.

93
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,900
It wouldn't be easy for Margo,
because she's so universally beloved,

94
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:31,859
and you're an absolute garbage lady,
but it would be unmissable TV.

95
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:35,299
The rhetoric around this bill
is that it was designed to prevent,

96
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:38,299
and I am using the biggest air
quotes imaginable here,

97
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,859
"irreversible harm".

98
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,340
And its supporters,
like many transphobes,

99
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:45,260
tend to fixate on the surgery part
of transitioning,

100
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,499
even though transitioning
is far more expansive than that,

101
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,820
may not entail surgery,
and, as we've said before,

102
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,379
when it does,
is none of your fucking business.

103
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,939
But when it comes
to the children of Alabama,

104
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,499
as a doctor told their legislature
last year, it's not even a factor.

105
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,179
Here's what we do
and what we don't.

106
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:10,299
Genital surgery is never
performed on minors in Alabama.

107
00:06:10,859 --> 00:06:14,100
Puberty blocking medications
are 100 percent reversible,

108
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:15,460
and can be lifesaving.

109
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:19,100
Now, some older teens,
not seven-year-olds,

110
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,140
merit hormonal therapy.

111
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,660
But initiation
involves lengthy informed consent,

112
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:29,539
lengthy mental health oversight,
and the sub-specialized care provided.

113
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:32,660
Yeah, of course doctors are going
to be thoughtful and rigorous

114
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:34,140
when caring for their patients.

115
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,660
Unlike the Alabama legislature,
they care about kids' well-being.

116
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:41,460
But you can also see why lawmakers
don't tell the whole picture

117
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:43,140
when it comes
to gender-affirming care.

118
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,979
Because a lawn sign saying,
"Ban Lengthy Informed Consent,

119
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:48,780
Lengthy Mental Health Oversight,
and Subspecialized Care"

120
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:51,340
doesn't quite have
the same punch to it, does it?

121
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,220
Now, the good news is,
on Friday,

122
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:56,660
a federal judge issued a preliminary
injunction on Alabama's ban,

123
00:06:56,739 --> 00:06:59,220
meaning that the state is barred,
for now,

124
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:01,020
from enforcing part of its law,

125
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,539
specifically,
the ban on access to medication.

126
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:05,780
But it's already
"working on filing an appeal",

127
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,700
and the rest of the law
very much remains in place.

128
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,100
You can't help thinking that this thing
is right-wing virtue signaling,

129
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:15,939
sending a hateful message
to a conservative base

130
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,939
with no thought given
to the pain that it will cause.

131
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,580
And no matter what the eventual
fate of the law is,

132
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,340
actual trans people
and their advocates in Alabama

133
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:27,460
have heard the message it was
meant to send, loud and clear.

134
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,660
As humans, they're afraid of us.

135
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:33,140
It's not really fun,

136
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,020
but as long
as it's protecting their ideals,

137
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,580
they don't care.

138
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,100
I'm just a normal kid.

139
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,619
I went to Hoover High School
and I was in engineering.

140
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,700
I played hockey,
a little weird for Alabama.

141
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,020
That's probably
the most abnormal part.

142
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,739
I'm trans,
and what harm am I doing?

143
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:56,660
Why you feel so comfortable
dictating other people's lives?

144
00:07:56,739 --> 00:08:00,140
I just need to know,
not religion-based,

145
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:03,100
where the entitlement
comes from.

146
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,739
To those senators and representatives
who support this bill,

147
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,820
thank you so much for making Alabama
a national embarrassment yet again.

148
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:16,059
He's absolutely right. And to trans
children in Alabama right now,

149
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,379
let me just say this.

150
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,140
Y'all... Am I saying that right?
Is it "y'all?"

151
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,700
I don't think I can carry that off.
You are important.

152
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,059
Your lives are important.

153
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,140
I cannot imagine trying to build
self-esteem in childhood

154
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,140
as your own government attempts
to undermine your very existence.

155
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,899
You should know, you are profoundly
valuable and you are irreplaceable.

156
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,820
Now, as for Kay Ivey,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

157
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,139
I know that's a simple question with
probably a long, complicated answer,

158
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,019
but to put this in terms
that you will definitely understand,

159
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,379
summer's hot, ocean's big,

160
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,820
and the people of Alabama
deserve a lot better than you.

161
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:52,139
And now, this!

162
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,340
And Now...

163
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,580
The Delightful Delight
of Alison Hammond.

164
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:00,259
These were from the original
"Blade Runner."

165
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,180
- This is what they used.
- Beautiful.

166
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:05,859
So, I thought, attention to detail,
the fans will probably like that.

167
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,460
That's so cool that you did that.

168
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,300
- Are you a fan of the original?
- Never seen it.

169
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,180
I'm going to give you a quote

170
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:17,940
and you have to let me know
whether you think it's Fakesheare.

171
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:19,779
Fakespeare.

172
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,899
Look at that, it's beautiful.

173
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:29,940
- How amazing is that?
- Why can't you just pick it up?

174
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:34,180
I care about you, too.
Here's some of the notes.

175
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:36,979
Here's one of them.
This is, "Love you".

176
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:38,859
You're just a badass.

177
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:41,499
You're a badass woman.

178
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:51,259
I don't drink.

179
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,899
And there you have it.
My cookies!

180
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,540
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns utilities,

181
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:09,739
specifically, electric utilities,

182
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,220
the companies responsible
for delivering us power,

183
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,379
and also giving us the creepiest mascot
ever created: Reddy Kilowatt,

184
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,100
a hell creature who appeared in ads
for over 200 electric companies,

185
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,619
like this one about him
"emancipating woman in the home",

186
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,940
and this one,
where he tells a housewife,

187
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:29,460
"Don't kill yourself,
it ain't worth it."

188
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,300
Reddy even appeared
on children's shows,

189
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:35,379
where he undoubtedly gave
a whole generation nightmares.

190
00:10:35,979 --> 00:10:37,220
What's going on here?

191
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,220
You should know that you can expect
anything to happen here, Mr. Toot.

192
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,340
Boy, I'll say.
What's happening now?

193
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,739
Those peanuts,
they're floating in the air!

194
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,379
That's my new
electrostatic generator.

195
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,700
Get out of there, Mr. Toot!

196
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,259
That's the only time
I've ever been scared for a clown.

197
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,340
We can't actually
show you the rest of that video,

198
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,739
because, and this is true,
if you watch it 'til the end,

199
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,979
Reddy shows up behind you
and brutally murders you.

200
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:09,420
You probably don't give too much
thought to your local electric utility.

201
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:12,700
But if you do, it might be because
they're charging exorbitant rates

202
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:16,420
for a basic human necessity,
as this North Carolina pastor explains.

203
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,340
One of the founding members
of this church, Sister Linda Jones,

204
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:24,820
she literally cut her pills in half,
skipped days,

205
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,659
in order to pay her light bill.

206
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,060
God bless her soul.
She passed on.

207
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,060
And there are hundreds of people
right around here

208
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:35,540
who need that help.

209
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:39,540
That is terrible.
And in case it bumped you at all,

210
00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:43,340
you're right, that was a property
brother that you just spotted there.

211
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,540
He made a documentary about utilities,
and it's actually pretty good,

212
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:49,220
to the point you're even going
to see a little more of it later on.

213
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,859
And if you're wondering
which property brother that is,

214
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,420
I'll give you a clue:
it is the circumcised one.

215
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,979
And if you don't know which
property brother is circumcised,

216
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,659
you're clearly not that big a fan
of the property brothers.

217
00:12:00,739 --> 00:12:03,859
And high bills are just the beginning
of the problems here.

218
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,019
Because utilities are also
exceptionally prone to scandal.

219
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,180
In fact, Google your utility company
right now, and the word "scandal",

220
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:14,300
and chances are, they've gotten
into some major trouble.

221
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:17,739
It's basically like Googling
your local Jimmy John's and "e. Coli"

222
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,499
or the name of your favorite teacher
from high school and "January 6th",

223
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,259
you're not going to like
the results that you find.

224
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:28,019
And at their worst,
utilities can even be deadly.

225
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,019
Take Pacific Gas & Electric,
one of California's largest utilities.

226
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,019
We've talked before
about the 2018 Camp Fire,

227
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,019
the deadliest wildfire
in California history,

228
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,300
and how it all started
when this hook

229
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:42,619
holding up a PG&E
transmission line broke,

230
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,899
causing the line
to ignite the brush below,

231
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:49,460
decimating several nearby communities
and leaving 85 people dead.

232
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,060
PG&E has since paid fines
and settlements,

233
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:55,060
but it's still very much in operation,
despite the fact

234
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:58,460
that wasn't close to the only scandal
that they've been involved in,

235
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,100
as this reporter will tell you.

236
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,820
This is a company that,
it was fined hundreds of times

237
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:06,300
and faced more than two,
almost $3 billion worth of fines.

238
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:10,540
If PG&E was an individual
and not a corporation,

239
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:12,340
by now
they would be in prison.

240
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,259
There's just been repeat offenders,

241
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,220
they've been on probation,
they've violated the probation.

242
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,019
The problem is, you can't take
a corporation and put it into prison.

243
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,820
He's right! You can't.
Even though many corporations

244
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:28,619
clearly deserve to be in prison,
from Enron to Purdue

245
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,619
to any company that insists on talking
like a sassy bitch on social media.

246
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,540
Hellmann's once Tweeted,

247
00:13:34,619 --> 00:13:37,739
"You're in their DMs,
we're getting spread on their bread".

248
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,180
And why?
You don't need to do this, Hellmann's.

249
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:43,139
You can just be mayonnaise.

250
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,619
But PG&E is not only not in prison,

251
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,379
it is still supplying power
to millions of Californians,

252
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,220
who have no choice in the matter.

253
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,779
And if you're thinking,
"How the fuck is that possible?"

254
00:13:54,859 --> 00:13:56,979
that is what this story is about.

255
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,139
It's about the incredible amount
of power that we give to utilities,

256
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,700
how weakly they can be regulated,
and the damage this can do.

257
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:07,820
Let's start with the most important
thing to know about utility companies,

258
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:11,619
which is that for most of us,
they're actually the only game in town.

259
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,019
If you want to go buy an iPhone,
or any other kind of consumer product,

260
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,779
you go out to a store
and you have a number of choices.

261
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,700
With electricity,
in most of the country,

262
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,979
you really only have one choice,
and that company has a monopoly.

263
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,220
Exactly! In our modern economy,
you are supposed to have choice.

264
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,220
Just look at all the streaming
services out there.

265
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,779
There's a Blockbuster 2.0,
superheroes and old racism,

266
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:38,379
anime, probably crashing
on you right now,

267
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:42,100
no idea, no idea,
and until recently, news Quibi.

268
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,700
That is arguably too much choice.

269
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:47,859
But utilities operating
as natural monopolies

270
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,779
dates back to the fact that,
around the start of the 20th century,

271
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:54,220
we needed to build a nationwide
power grid from scratch,

272
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,060
and that obviously
required a huge investment.

273
00:14:57,139 --> 00:14:59,700
Companies were only incentivized
to do that with a guarantee

274
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:02,779
that they'd be able to operate
in a noncompetitive environment.

275
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:07,420
And at the time, that made sense.
Those monopolies persist to this day,

276
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,820
and mostly as for-profit,
investor-owned companies.

277
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:14,139
Now, in exchange for giving
utilities a deal that sweet,

278
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,420
we did put some restrictions
in place.

279
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,100
The law says that they should
spend the least they can

280
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,019
while providing quality,
environmentally safe service.

281
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,019
Which sounds great. Because it caps
their ability to make too much money.

282
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,019
But, and this is a huge but,
there is a carve out.

283
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,460
Because when they build something,
a piece of physical infrastructure,

284
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,460
they are allowed to then pass
along that cost to you,

285
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,460
through your bill,
plus an additional percentage

286
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,420
that they get to keep as profit,
usually around 10 percent.

287
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:46,460
And this creates a clear incentive:
the bigger the project,

288
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,300
like a power plant,
the more profit they make,

289
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:50,979
as this activist explains.

290
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,300
Big monopoly utilities get a guaranteed
range of a rate of return

291
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:57,139
on their capital expenditures.

292
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,659
So, like a waiter in a restaurant
where there's a guaranteed tip,

293
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:06,220
the more that is spent, if you buy
dessert or you get a bottle of wine,

294
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,540
the more money
they're going to make.

295
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:12,340
Right. If your profit is pegged
to doing certain things,

296
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,820
you're going to make sure
that you do those things more.

297
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:19,259
It's like if HBO only paid me for every
time I got weirdly horny for an animal.

298
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,300
Except that's a bad example,

299
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:24,499
because the show would pretty much
look exactly like it already does.

300
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,940
Not now. Not now.
I'm trying to make a point.

301
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,300
Go away before I change my mind.

302
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:32,019
Goodness gracious.

303
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,300
And in the best-case scenario,
this might mean that utilities

304
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:38,979
are investing in infrastructure
that is badly needed.

305
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,540
The problem is, they can also be
shameless in increasing spending,

306
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:44,100
even when it is not needed,

307
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,940
or on projects
that are actively falling apart.

308
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:48,420
Take South Carolina.

309
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:52,060
When utilities there tried to add two
nuclear reactors to an existing plant,

310
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:53,979
the project's cost spiraled.

311
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,300
And a massive federal investigation
later revealed

312
00:16:56,379 --> 00:17:00,139
that executives at South Carolina
Electric & Gas and its parent company

313
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,460
knew the project was facing major
delays and cost overruns

314
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,939
but withheld that information
in order to keep it going.

315
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,859
Meanwhile, local customers

316
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:12,179
paid more than $2 billion
in the form of higher bills,

317
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,899
for a project which, by the way,
"never generated any power."

318
00:17:16,379 --> 00:17:20,020
Some working on the project at the time
were troubled by what they were seeing.

319
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,740
Listen to this leaked voicemail, from
a vice president at the parent company

320
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,300
who later became a whistleblower,

321
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:28,500
in which she tried to warn her
colleagues about what was happening.

322
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:32,740
They are mismanaging that project.
And it's at y'alls expense.

323
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,060
They're doing it
because they want to make money

324
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:40,100
and they're propping up earnings
to be able to make their bonuses,

325
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,179
and it's going
to be at your expense.

326
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:46,179
That's pretty shocking, isn't it?
Not just what she's saying there,

327
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,820
but also,
that people still leave voicemails.

328
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:51,619
Absolutely no one
should be doing that anymore.

329
00:17:51,699 --> 00:17:54,179
In fact, every voicemail
greeting should just be,

330
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,859
"Sorry I missed your call. Please
don't leave a message after the tone,

331
00:17:57,939 --> 00:18:00,699
just text me instead,
because it's not 1997".

332
00:18:01,939 --> 00:18:05,580
Overspending isn't the only way
that utilities' incentives

333
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:07,540
can wind up
screwing over customers.

334
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,740
Because they can deliberately
stifle innovation

335
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,580
that might make power cheaper,
or be a net benefit to society,

336
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,780
as this solar power
executive will tell you.

337
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:19,100
Now solar is becoming real,
the utility monopolies are saying,

338
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:22,740
"Well, wait a minute, we've got
to crush it before it gets too big".

339
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,540
They want to build more plants
so they can make more money,

340
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:28,780
and if we take a little bite
out of that apple, and we say,

341
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:31,459
"Hey guys, we've got solar panels
everywhere on all these homes,

342
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,500
you don't need to build
that many more power plants".

343
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,699
Then the utility goes, "How am I
going to make more money next year?"

344
00:18:37,139 --> 00:18:41,699
Yeah. People putting up solar panels
and generating their own electricity

345
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,980
threatens the anticompetitive
structure of a utility's monopoly,

346
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,619
so they're obviously going to try
and step in and block it.

347
00:18:48,699 --> 00:18:51,619
Who wants competition?
It just makes things harder!

348
00:18:51,939 --> 00:18:55,780
You think I want to compete
with "Euphoria" or "Love Island"

349
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:59,139
or this YouTube video of ducks
annihilating a bowl of peas?

350
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:13,379
You could be watching
that on a loop right now

351
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:15,859
instead of watching this show,
you idiots.

352
00:19:15,939 --> 00:19:18,500
Why are you still here?
Make better choices!

353
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,379
Some activists
have even used rooftop solar

354
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:25,179
as a way of challenging
the monopolies in their states.

355
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,580
Remember that church from earlier,
where the pastor was talking

356
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:30,179
about people cutting pills in half
to make ends meet?

357
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:35,179
Well, in 2015, to help cut costs,
it partnered with this local nonprofit,

358
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,219
and in an attempt to challenge
the laws on the books,

359
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,820
the nonprofit installed
a small solar panel system

360
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:43,500
on the roof of the church,
at no upfront cost,

361
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,300
financing it
by selling electricity to them

362
00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:50,020
at about half the rate that their
utility, Duke Energy, charged.

363
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,980
Similar arrangements
are permitted in other states,

364
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,699
but not in North Carolina,
and Duke Energy pushed back hard,

365
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,500
asking the state's regulators to "issue
a cease and desist" to the non-profit

366
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,379
and invoke its power to fine them
up to $1,000 a day

367
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:06,899
for every day it sold power
to the church.

368
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,939
And in the end,
Duke Energy got what they wanted.

369
00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:12,899
That church's solar arrangement
was shut down,

370
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,659
and any hope of replicating it
in the state was squashed.

371
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,780
And when
Circumcised Property Brother

372
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:22,459
asked Duke about this whole saga,
their response wasn't great.

373
00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:26,540
Faith Community Church wanted
to test regulation in North Carolina

374
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:29,060
by doing something
that was basically illegal.

375
00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:31,459
- They were trying to pick a fight?
- You could say that.

376
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:36,060
They had a good setup to get publicity.
This was an African American church,

377
00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:38,179
and we're a big utility
and we're a target,

378
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,260
and sometimes
there are groups out there,

379
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:43,340
they're not trying to advance policy,
they're trying to get media attention,

380
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:44,859
and they did a good job here.

381
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:49,179
Are there situations where,
as a human being, you have a conflict

382
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,780
as a utility company where you're
saying this is how it has to be,

383
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:55,060
versus maybe there's a bigger picture
with something that's broken?

384
00:20:56,139 --> 00:20:57,980
I think that's just the way
it has been.

385
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,300
Wait! "Just the way it's been"
has, historically,

386
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:05,300
never been a great justification
for something still happening.

387
00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:07,939
In fact, there is only one time
that that works as an argument,

388
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,179
and it's when you're talking about
the Milwaukee Brewers sausage race.

389
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,540
Why do a bunch of sausages
race around the field

390
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:16,060
before the bottom
of the sixth inning?

391
00:21:16,139 --> 00:21:18,300
Because that's the way it's been.

392
00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:20,459
It doesn't make sense,
and may it never change.

393
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,419
Long live the racing sausages.

394
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,899
And there are examples
all over the country

395
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,899
of utilities getting in the way
of people using solar energy.

396
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,740
The argument being,
if people start leaving the grid

397
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,020
and generating their own power,
then over time,

398
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,780
the cost is gonna go up
for everyone left behind.

399
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,780
And look, there is
a longer conversation to be had

400
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:42,540
about the proper way to bill
people who use solar panels.

401
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:46,540
But making it cost-prohibitive
is definitely not the answer.

402
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:47,939
And if you're thinking,

403
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,419
"Shouldn't there be someone
who can rein these companies in?"

404
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,260
In theory, there is. Most states
have public utility commissions.

405
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,740
They are responsible for signing off
on any big investments proposed,

406
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,139
and, also, overseeing
the setting of rates.

407
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:03,540
Unfortunately,
many of them are badly outmatched

408
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:05,659
by the utilities
that they're supposed to regulate.

409
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,899
And this can have major consequences.
A few years back,

410
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,659
Mississippi Power
ran into massive cost overruns

411
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,500
on a new plant
that it was building,

412
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,619
which was initially
"expected to cost $1.8 billion,"

413
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:19,699
but ended up ballooning
to seven and a half billion.

414
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,379
And in hindsight,
there were obvious red flags

415
00:22:22,459 --> 00:22:25,139
that you would hope the state
commission would've been more wary of

416
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,619
from the very start.

417
00:22:26,699 --> 00:22:29,899
Just listen to a company representative
explain his side of the story.

418
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,699
Can you tell us why the project

419
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:36,980
is over budget
and also behind schedule?

420
00:22:37,379 --> 00:22:40,820
I would tell you that if we made
any errors in judgment at all,

421
00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:44,300
any missteps, is that when we took
that proposal to the commission,

422
00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:47,260
we were only at between
10 or 15 percent of design.

423
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:53,100
The little engineering that we had
done at that particular point in time

424
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:57,139
that has sort of come back to haunt us
in terms of cost and schedule.

425
00:22:57,699 --> 00:23:02,580
Let me get this straight. The plant
was only 10 to 15 percent designed,

426
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:04,699
and the commission let it go
ahead anyway?

427
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,100
That is not how designing
complex energy plants should work.

428
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,500
That's not even how
designing Lego sets work.

429
00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:12,260
That's why
you've never seen one called

430
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,459
"A Little Tree
and You Figure Out the Rest."

431
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,820
In Mississippi's case, the problem
seems to have been a commission

432
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:21,580
rushing to approve a project
without doing proper due diligence.

433
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:24,219
But in other cases,
like Alabama's state commission,

434
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,419
the problem
seems to be ideological.

435
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,699
It has been described
as "one of the most opaque,

436
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:32,939
politically motivated, environmentally
hostile commissions in the country".

437
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,619
Their commissioners are elected,
and I do want to show you

438
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:38,379
one campaign ad for the woman
who is currently running it.

439
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,300
Twinkle's priority
is our priority: jobs!

440
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,540
We need more conservatives
like Twinkle who put jobs first.

441
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,580
Twinkle is a proven
conservative Republican.

442
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:53,020
Who has stood up and fought the liberal
special interest in Washington.

443
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,419
Conservative, Republican,
Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh.

444
00:23:56,939 --> 00:23:58,459
Our way of fighting back.

445
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:03,659
Yeah, that woman is named Twinkle.
That is her actual given name.

446
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,419
As in, when she was born,
her parents were asked,

447
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,740
"What do you want
to name your baby?"

448
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,179
And they genuinely replied,
"Twinkle. Definitely Twinkle."

449
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,260
She even confirmed
this story herself, saying,

450
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,500
"My daddy
thought I needed a fancy name.

451
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,379
It may be cute for a 3 year old,
but it gets old."

452
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:21,659
I could see how being called Twinkle
could get old after a while.

453
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,219
But let me just say this, Twinkle:

454
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:28,060
for everyone who isn't you, calling
you Twinkle will never get old.

455
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:30,379
It will never get old, Twinkle.

456
00:24:31,459 --> 00:24:34,100
And look, I'm not saying that Twinkle
is a bad commissioner

457
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:35,379
because she's called Twinkle.

458
00:24:35,459 --> 00:24:37,859
I'm saying that Twinkle's a bad
commissioner because for one thing,

459
00:24:37,939 --> 00:24:39,619
when there was a push
for more open hearings

460
00:24:39,939 --> 00:24:42,740
on electricity rates in the state,
she outright said,

461
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,179
"I want to exclude environmentalists
from taking part in the process,"

462
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,340
and suggested
that "environmental extremists"

463
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,699
only wanted these open proceedings
so they could

464
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,500
"trot out their fancy San Francisco
environmental lawyers

465
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,379
and junk science hucksters."

466
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:57,540
And the thing is,
it's not just Twinkle!

467
00:24:57,619 --> 00:25:00,419
When one of Alabama's
other commissioners, Chip Beeker,

468
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,300
again, real name,

469
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,699
because it seems Alabama's utility
commissioners must, by law,

470
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,219
sound like Hanna-Barbera
cartoon characters.

471
00:25:08,699 --> 00:25:12,419
When Chip Beeker was running
for his position, he wrote in an op-ed,

472
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,820
"The so-called 'climate change crisis'

473
00:25:14,899 --> 00:25:18,459
is about as real as unicorns
and little green men from Mars."

474
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:22,500
Which is obviously ridiculous
because climate change is very real,

475
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,300
and unicorns,
sadly, do not exist.

476
00:25:25,379 --> 00:25:26,899
Which I know is not ideal.

477
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,020
Although if you're in the market for
a majestic creature with a lot of horn,

478
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,580
this guy

479
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:33,619
may be able

480
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:35,659
to help you.

481
00:25:36,939 --> 00:25:41,459
Having a commission run by science
denying ideologues is bad enough.

482
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:46,379
But in other states, public officials
can appear fully in utilities' pockets.

483
00:25:46,459 --> 00:25:50,500
Take Ohio. A few years back,
a big utility there, FirstEnergy,

484
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,659
was caught up
in this massive scandal.

485
00:25:53,139 --> 00:25:55,820
Ohio House Speaker Larry
Householder and four others

486
00:25:55,899 --> 00:25:57,459
have been charged with racketeering,

487
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,899
accused feds of funneling millions
from the energy company

488
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,740
into a 501c4 dark money
group called Generation Now.

489
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,459
Generation Now sounds
like a failed '90s boy band

490
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,899
whose members are all now spokesmen
for different crypto currency companies.

491
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,540
But very basically, what happened
there is that FirstEnergy

492
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:20,139
funneled $60 million
to the Speaker of the Ohio House

493
00:26:20,219 --> 00:26:23,179
to get him to pass a bill,
HB 6, that has been called

494
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,580
"the worst energy bill
of the 21st century."

495
00:26:26,659 --> 00:26:29,459
I have to tell you,
the House speaker in question

496
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,740
denies wrongdoing,
and is still awaiting trial.

497
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,659
What is very clear is that FirstEnergy
was working extremely hard

498
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,179
to influence
the decision-making process.

499
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,980
They actually paid the chairman
of the state's utility commission

500
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:44,060
$22 million in consulting fees,

501
00:26:44,139 --> 00:26:47,939
in the years directly preceding him
becoming their regulator.

502
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,740
And while he denies
doing anything improper,

503
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,820
I will point out that,
on the very day the bill passed,

504
00:26:53,899 --> 00:26:56,780
FirstEnergy's CEO wrote to him,
saying, and I quote,

505
00:26:56,859 --> 00:27:02,699
"HB 6, fuck anybody who ain't us."
Which is very cool, right?

506
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,939
And just so you know,
the man who wrote that is this guy,

507
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,020
who looks like
he's left lengthy reviews

508
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,740
for multiple gas grills
on Home-Depot-dotcom.

509
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:14,459
This man wrote the words,
"Fuck anybody who ain't us."

510
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:19,379
This old, white man typed those precise
words with his old, white fingers.

511
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,659
To recap: our utility system largely
consists of for-profit companies,

512
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,980
with monopolies
over an essential service

513
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,619
building as much shit
as they possibly can

514
00:27:29,699 --> 00:27:32,980
so they can pass the cost along
to you on your electric bill.

515
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:37,939
And to see just how bad all this
can get, let's go back to PG&E,

516
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,459
arguably California's
most hated company.

517
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,020
A quick skim through
any PG&E affiliate's Yelp page

518
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,260
gives you just a taste of that,
because you'll find reviews like,

519
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,260
"Absolute shit show,"
"Fucking garbage company,"

520
00:27:50,699 --> 00:27:52,980
"Fuck you, PG&E.
Your day will come."

521
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:56,699
And my personal favorite,
"The actual technicians = lovely.

522
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,300
Often hot, too boot.
Phone people = hit or miss.

523
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:02,300
Either dismissive and
stupid or thoughtful and kind.

524
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:05,659
Corporation itself
= evil empire personified."

525
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,179
Which is a lot more nuance than you
typically find in Yelp reviews.

526
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,260
"I understand
that the lowest ranking,

527
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,459
smoking hot employee
that I interfaced with

528
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,139
isn't to blame for the company's
larger structural problems.

529
00:28:16,219 --> 00:28:19,699
But for the record, fuck everyone
in the C-suite with a cactus."

530
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:24,419
And you can see why Californians
hate PG&E so much.

531
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:29,980
In just one three-year timespan, it was
responsible for around 1,500 fires.

532
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,780
That's an average
of "more than one fire a day."

533
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:37,179
And at that point, PG&E are less
a utility and more a fire company

534
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,419
that occasionally also
delivers power to people's homes.

535
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,820
And so many of PG&E's problems

536
00:28:42,899 --> 00:28:45,580
stem from the way
that they're incentivized to operate.

537
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:47,659
Because remember,
their profits are pegged

538
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,980
to money that they spend
on new infrastructure that they build,

539
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:54,659
not on what they spend maintaining it,
or the area around it.

540
00:28:55,219 --> 00:28:58,699
And when you don't maintain
equipment, eventually, it fails.

541
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:03,859
That old hook that broke and started
the Camp Fire was 97 years old.

542
00:29:03,939 --> 00:29:07,540
And it's not even their only hook
that was dangerously worn down.

543
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:10,179
This hook,
found a couple of miles up the line

544
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,780
from where the Camp Fire started,
shows just how bad things got.

545
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:18,500
A groove, more than halfway through
the metal from decades of grinding,

546
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,540
against the hole it hung from.

547
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,379
Holy shit!

548
00:29:22,939 --> 00:29:25,419
"Decades of grinding"
isn't exactly a phrase

549
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,060
that you want to associate with
a vital piece of our power grid.

550
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,740
It's barely a phrase you want to hear
at your grandparent's 50th anniversary.

551
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,060
You're happy for them,

552
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:37,459
it's obviously what's kept
them together for so long,

553
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,379
you don't want to hear it.

554
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,419
It's not like PG&E didn't have the
money to perform basic maintenance,

555
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,540
because in the five years
before the Camp Fire,

556
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,659
it issued over $5 billion
in dividends to shareholders.

557
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:56,780
This isn't a system where you, the
customer, are going to be prioritized.

558
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:00,659
If anything, the model only makes sense
if the company's shareholders

559
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:04,020
are viewed as the customer,
and your bills are the product.

560
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,899
And while you would hope
elected officials in California

561
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,699
would crack down on PG&E,
many take money from them,

562
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,780
and don't seem to see anything
really wrong with that.

563
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:17,619
Just watch as California's governor
blows off a pretty pointed question.

564
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,500
PG&E was convicted of a federal,
of six federal felonies in 2016.

565
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,300
After that, you took more
than $200,000 to help get elected.

566
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:28,459
How should people trust you
to come up with the solutions?

567
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,500
I wish you luck
with whatever you're working on,

568
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,139
but that's a strange question.

569
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,859
Wait, is it, though? Is it?

570
00:30:36,939 --> 00:30:39,500
Because that seemed
pretty reasonable to me.

571
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,659
It's not like that reporter asked,
"Mr. Governor!

572
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,100
Why do you think The Wiggles
had Princess Diana killed?"

573
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:45,659
That is a strange question.

574
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,340
There was no big red car
anywhere near the scene.

575
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:50,980
But what he just asked
you deserved a proper answer.

576
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,899
And yet, frustratingly,
if you live in California,

577
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,379
and PG&E is your provider,
there is nothing you can do.

578
00:30:57,699 --> 00:30:59,540
Every time you turn your lights on,

579
00:30:59,619 --> 00:31:02,419
you are reminded
your utility has killed people,

580
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,300
and the only real recourse you have
is giving them a shitty Yelp review.

581
00:31:06,379 --> 00:31:07,939
So, how do we fix this?

582
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,139
If we were able to start
our power grid over from scratch,

583
00:31:11,219 --> 00:31:12,540
what we would probably do

584
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:15,580
is make utilities publicly owned
and run by the government.

585
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:17,740
It wouldn't fix everything,
things might still go wrong,

586
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,980
but you would remove so many
of the worst incentives here.

587
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,139
Unfortunately, transitioning now
would be hugely expensive,

588
00:31:24,219 --> 00:31:27,219
and, in all likelihood,
isn't happening anytime soon.

589
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,340
But there are smaller steps that we
should also be taking in the meantime.

590
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:32,500
For instance,
instead of having a system

591
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,379
where utilities are incentivized
just to build stuff,

592
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:38,820
we could incentivize them to work
in the customers' best interests,

593
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:41,219
by investing in things
like maintenance, renewables,

594
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,820
and energy conservation.

595
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:45,540
This is something known
as performance-based regulation,

596
00:31:45,619 --> 00:31:47,379
and several states
are already trying it.

597
00:31:47,459 --> 00:31:49,060
Now, as for the regulators,

598
00:31:49,139 --> 00:31:52,939
commissions will, unfortunately,
probably always vary in effectiveness

599
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,340
depending on whether it's staffed
by people who give a shit about this,

600
00:31:56,419 --> 00:31:59,020
or, let's say,
someone named Twinkle.

601
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,859
But we have to make sure
that under resourced regulators

602
00:32:02,939 --> 00:32:05,740
get more support,
more access to technical expertise,

603
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,419
and more jurisdiction over
the companies that they monitor.

604
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,100
At this point I would usually bring out
a mascot that we made for utilities,

605
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:15,580
that's representative of just how
terrible and horrifying they are.

606
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:18,419
But amazingly,
I don't even need to do that, do I?

607
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,780
Because they already made
a murderous hell-demon

608
00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:23,459
almost 100 years ago,
with Reddy Kilowatt.

609
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,619
So, all we really need to do
is simply bring Reddy back.

610
00:32:26,699 --> 00:32:31,139
So, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm thrilled to present to you

611
00:32:31,219 --> 00:32:33,340
the glorious return
of Reddy Kilowatt!

612
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:38,100
Reddy, where are you?
Where are you, Reddy?

613
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:41,899
Hello, John!
Hello, boys and girls!

614
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,300
Yeah. This is creepy.
I'm already regretting this.

615
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,379
Where is the clown, Reddy?
Where's Mr. Toot?

616
00:32:46,459 --> 00:32:48,179
- He's dead, John.
- Yep.

617
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,580
I killed him.

618
00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:52,300
Of course you did. I'd like to leave.
This is a bad idea.

619
00:32:52,379 --> 00:32:54,619
- Who said you could do that?
- Why! Fuck!

620
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,820
The world is my monopoly,
and I alone control it.

621
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,379
- Do you want to use the refrigerator?
- Yes, I do.

622
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:03,540
Do you want your fucking lights
to go on and off?

623
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:06,780
- Yes, I do.
- Then your local utility is your god.

624
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,659
- Right.
- I am your god.

625
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,780
I cannot believe I'm saying this,
but you are actually

626
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:15,780
too good at representing
how shitty utility companies are.

627
00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:18,379
- You have no idea.
- Why?

628
00:33:18,459 --> 00:33:23,219
I could kill you right now, and there's
nothing anyone could do about it.

629
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:27,419
Don't be nasty about it.
Shit, what happened to the lights?

630
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:32,219
- Blackouts happen, John.
- Turn the lights back on, you freak!

631
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:37,100
You can do it yourself, John!
Just go ahead and pull that lever!

632
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:38,859
Wait, just this one here?

633
00:33:39,939 --> 00:33:41,100
Okay. Here it goes.

634
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,500
I am gonna get
such a fine for that!

635
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,419
That's our show.
Thank you so much for watching.

636
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,740
See you next week
for another episode

637
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,899
of "Last Week Tonight
with Reddy Kilowatt."

638
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:00,820
Bye bye!

639
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,939
In Loving Memory
of John Oliver

640
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:08,179
Beloved Son, Husband, Father
and Aspiring Comedian.
