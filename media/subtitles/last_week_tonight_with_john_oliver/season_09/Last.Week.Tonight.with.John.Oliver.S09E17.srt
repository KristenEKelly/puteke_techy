1
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,290
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight".
I'm John Oliver.

2
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:36,810
Thank you so much for joining us.
We are back,

3
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,890
and sadly there is no time
to recap everything

4
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,409
that we've missed
in the last month,

5
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,409
including multiple world leaders
losing their jobs,

6
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,009
sometimes after mass protest,
like in Sri Lanka,

7
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:48,409
and sometimes after
mass government resignations,

8
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,530
like in the UK,

9
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,729
where Boris Johnson finally
stepped down in disgrace,

10
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,769
prompting this magnificent
man-on-the-street interview.

11
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,649
Excuse me, sir, sorry to disturb.
I'm from BBC Newsnight,

12
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:02,490
just wondering what you think
of Boris Johnson resigning today.

13
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,689
I want him to go.
He's a pain in the ass.

14
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,329
Excellent. I mean, Dirtbag English
Stanley Tucci is perfect.

15
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,090
From now on, that man should
be asked for comment

16
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,129
on every major news event.

17
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:17,370
In fact, put him on "Love Island"
right now.

18
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,929
I'm so fucking serious about this.

19
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,610
A new bombshell has entered the villa.

20
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:25,090
Meanwhile, here in the US,

21
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,329
the January 6th committee
hearings have been continuing,

22
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:29,329
with the latest taking place
on Thursday,

23
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:31,730
featuring some interesting footage
of Josh Hawley,

24
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,810
who you may remember riled up
the crowd earlier in the day

25
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,489
with a fist of solidarity,

26
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:38,970
but who we now know
was seen running for safety

27
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:43,250
after they stormed the Capitol.
That is painfully embarrassing.

28
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,810
That is the gait of a man who's either
just gassed up an insurrection

29
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,450
that's now bearing down
on top of him,

30
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,769
or just drank a large iced coffee
45 minutes ago.

31
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,569
Either way, those legs scream
"I've made a huge mistake".

32
00:01:57,049 --> 00:01:58,810
But maybe the best response
to that clip

33
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,250
came from former DC police officer
Michael Fanone,

34
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:05,010
who was injured in the riot,
and offered this commentary.

35
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,490
The first thoughts that popped
into my mind was,

36
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:12,609
Josh Hawley is a bitch
and he ran like a bitch.

37
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:15,129
Now, I personally would not say that.

38
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,569
I'd say Josh Hawley is a bitch
who ran like a chihuahua

39
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,490
desperately trying to keep up
with its owner on a casual walk.

40
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:23,449
But you know what,
to each their own.

41
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,210
And look, I'm sure that there'll be more
to say about this

42
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:28,050
when the hearings resume
in September,

43
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:31,169
but for now, we're gonna dive straight
in with our main story this week,

44
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,009
as it concerns a topic that's been
at the forefront of the news

45
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,330
over the past year.

46
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:37,129
Tonight, inflation nation.

47
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,650
Inflation's grip on American
consumers not letting up.

48
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:42,289
It's called lunch-flation.

49
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,729
- Booze flation.
- Milk-flation.

50
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,689
Meat-flation is rocking the nation.

51
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,970
Okay, first, a big, enthusiastic nope
to the word "meatflation",

52
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:54,449
which sounds less like
an economic phenomenon

53
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,370
and more like a slang term
for a boner.

54
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:59,889
It is honestly hard to think
of a more unpleasant portmanteau

55
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,250
than meatflation,
aside from maybe "snart",

56
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,330
which combines the words sneeze
and fart,

57
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:05,650
or "Ronzo",

58
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:08,449
which would obviously be the celebrity
couple name if Ron Howard

59
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,729
ever fucked Gonzo the Muppet.

60
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,330
As you undoubtedly know,

61
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:15,650
the US is experiencing the highest
inflation of the past 40 years.

62
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,050
And despite initial hopes
that it would be temporary,

63
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:19,849
prices are still going up.

64
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:25,530
Over the past year, food is up 10.4%,
electricity is up 13.7%,

65
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:28,770
and gasoline is up 59.9%.

66
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:29,889
So, to be honest,

67
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,330
it's a good idea to start making your
gasoline at home in the morning

68
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:36,930
instead of getting an expensive
cup of it on your way to work.

69
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,810
And in some cases, companies
have tried to hide inflation

70
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:41,849
by keeping their prices the same,

71
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,050
but reducing the size of their
products. It's called shrinkflation.

72
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:48,449
And news outlets love
to cover this,

73
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,409
usually with the help of what seems
to be the one go-to expert on the topic.

74
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:56,650
There's almost no category of product
except eggs, maybe,

75
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:59,770
that hasn't been downsized
over the past years.

76
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:03,729
Consumer advocate Ed Dworsky
is publisher of mouse-print-dot-org.

77
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:10,530
Crest 3D White went from 4.1 ounces
to 3.8 ounces.

78
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:14,009
Apple Cinnamon Cheerios went
from 20.1 ounces

79
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,530
to 19 ounces.

80
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:18,570
It's still called "family size".
The family must've gotten smaller.

81
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,489
Here you've got
two bottles of Gatorade

82
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,609
and these have just changed
in the past few months.

83
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:30,249
This one is the old 32-ounce one.
This one is four ounces less.

84
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,890
They said they made it easier
to grip, you know.

85
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,169
Give me a break.

86
00:04:35,249 --> 00:04:37,530
Yeah! You tell 'em, Ed!

87
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,690
I love everything about that man,

88
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,929
from his website,
mouse-print-dot-org,

89
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,609
which is somehow not
an online literary journal

90
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,369
for writers who happen to be rodents,

91
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,169
to his electrifying
delivery of the word "eggs",

92
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:54,130
to his utter refusal to tolerate even
the slightest amount of bullshit

93
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,770
from Gatorade.

94
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:58,249
But whether it's inflation,
shrinkflation,

95
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,570
or meatflation, rising prices
are clearly a problem.

96
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,690
Although hourly earnings were up
5.1% over the past year,

97
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,010
overall wages fell by 3.6%

98
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,570
when adjusted for inflation.

99
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,530
And for those on fixed incomes
or tight budgets,

100
00:05:13,609 --> 00:05:17,249
like students and retirees, inflation
is especially difficult to handle,

101
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,809
and can amount to a life overhaul.

102
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:24,849
Patti Byther just unretired and
got ready for her new part-time job.

103
00:05:25,369 --> 00:05:26,489
I thought I was done.

104
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,970
I had worked it all out financially
that, you know, I could afford it.

105
00:05:29,049 --> 00:05:33,249
With prices soaring,
her retirement lasted 10 months.

106
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,609
These are my fuel bills.

107
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,729
In 13 months, it went up 150 dollars.

108
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,650
Correct. My safety net is just gone.

109
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:43,489
When do you
see yourself retiring for real?

110
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,289
I don't really see a time when
I'll be able to retire again,

111
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:50,570
or entirely again, which is sort
of annoying and sad.

112
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,130
Yeah. That is putting it lightly!

113
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,489
It must be so frustrating to retire,
think you're done,

114
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,609
and then have to go back to work.

115
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,169
That is the absolute worst-case
scenario of retirement,

116
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:03,890
other than, of course,
moving to Florida.

117
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,530
So, given that it is hurting so many
people right now,

118
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:09,890
tonight, let's examine inflation,

119
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,650
what caused it, what
we've done to address it so far,

120
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:14,049
and what could happen next.

121
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,530
And let's start with how exactly
we got here.

122
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:19,929
Because you've probably heard
a lot of explanations flying around.

123
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:24,210
This is Biden-flation,
a 39-year high created by Joe Biden.

124
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:27,049
Make no mistake. Inflation
is largely the fault of Putin.

125
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,849
The supply chain is the catalyst
at the end of the day.

126
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:32,809
Inflation is not caused
by the Build Back Better

127
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,809
or the bipartisan bill.
It's caused by corporate greed.

128
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,169
Yeah, there has been a flurry
of finger pointing,

129
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:41,970
with many tending to place the blame
on whatever they were already mad at,

130
00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:44,210
with some Democrats blaming
corporate greed,

131
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:47,450
Republicans blaming Joe Biden,
Biden blaming Putin,

132
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,369
and your dog presumably blaming
the vacuum cleaner.

133
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,970
And here is the interesting thing.
Aside from the dog,

134
00:06:54,049 --> 00:06:56,770
they're probably all
at least a little bit right,

135
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:00,130
because the truth is,
there is no one cause of inflation.

136
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,770
At the best of times, it involves
a multitude of factors,

137
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:05,489
and the situation
that we're in right now

138
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,049
has been an unprecedented
perfect storm.

139
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,609
And to understand that storm,
it might actually help to pause

140
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,369
for a moment to talk about
the mechanics of inflation.

141
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,049
Very basically, it happens whenever
there is too much demand

142
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,690
for too little supply.

143
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,570
If people
have lots of money to spend,

144
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,289
they usually want to buy more stuff.

145
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:25,169
But if there is not enough stuff
to go around,

146
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:27,729
then the price of that stuff goes up.

147
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:31,010
I'll give you an example. Let's say that
every single person in America

148
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,330
suddenly wins the lottery,

149
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:35,690
and everyone now has
40 million dollars to spend.

150
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,049
What are they going to do?

151
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,090
Well, I would assume that
they'd do what I would,

152
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:40,409
which is immediately buy

153
00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:43,489
this 1 500 dollar emerald patina
fountain statue

154
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,770
of a frog spreading its unnaturally
long legs

155
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:49,570
in a manner that seems offensive,
but I'm not exactly sure to who.

156
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:53,849
Now, by the way, the frog comes
in two sizes, "large" and "giant".

157
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:56,489
Now, obviously,
if you win the lottery,

158
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,049
you are springing for the giant one.

159
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,010
But there are currently
only three of them left in stock.

160
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,450
So, the statues are likely
to get more expensive,

161
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,650
because everyone
suddenly wants one,

162
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:08,489
as they all have
more money to spend,

163
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,729
but there are only three left.

164
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:13,970
Basically, high demand,
not enough supply,

165
00:08:14,049 --> 00:08:16,530
and that's how we get frog-flation.

166
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:19,330
So, too much money chasing
a limited supply of goods

167
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:20,690
can lead to inflation.

168
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,929
And some on the right have seized
on the "too much money" part

169
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:28,369
to suggest that inflation
is really just down to one thing.

170
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:32,290
When you put 6 trillion dollars
of fiscal stimulus into the economy

171
00:08:32,369 --> 00:08:34,609
as President Biden
and Democrats did last year,

172
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,769
you're going to end up
with big time inflation.

173
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,249
The March stimulus package
literally manufactured inflation.

174
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,529
This inflation is caused
by Democrat policies.

175
00:08:43,609 --> 00:08:44,690
It didn't just happen.

176
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:47,489
This is the Democrat tax
on the middle class.

177
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,729
That is some pretty heavy fire there.

178
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,129
Calling something a "tax on the middle
class" is one of the best ways

179
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,489
to make it look bad,
just after calling it

180
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,050
"a close associate
of Prince Andrew".

181
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:02,129
Blaming Biden's
stimulus package has become

182
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,889
a common refrain on the
right when discussing inflation.

183
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,649
And the reality is, there is
a kernel of truth to it.

184
00:09:08,729 --> 00:09:10,889
Thanks to the pandemic-era
stimulus bills,

185
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,050
people did have more cash on hand.

186
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:15,489
But that is not the only reason.

187
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,849
As strange as it sounds, many people
saved money during the early days

188
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,170
of the pandemic, simply because
we were all stuck at home.

189
00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:24,410
By one estimate,
households actually accumulated

190
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:28,410
two and a half trillion dollars in
excess savings during the pandemic.

191
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:30,769
And to the extent that people
were spending money,

192
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:34,249
it mostly wasn't on services like
flights or hotels or restaurants.

193
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,970
Instead, it went to goods like
furniture, appliances,

194
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,290
or some steamy watercolor rat erotica.

195
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:45,170
I'm just describing what most
people did in 2020.

196
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,090
And what's more, the notion that
our economy would be fine

197
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,849
if not for Biden's stimulus,

198
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:54,210
completely ignores what it
would've looked like without it.

199
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,570
Because it not only protected
low-income workers,

200
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:58,330
who were in real trouble,

201
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,369
it also helped us avoid a Covid
induced financial crisis.

202
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,489
And while, with hindsight,
most economists would say

203
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,330
that we could have made it
more targeted and precise,

204
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,170
so that we didn't increase the money
supply any more than we had to,

205
00:10:11,249 --> 00:10:14,290
it is very important to note that,
according to one estimate,

206
00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:16,649
without the American Rescue Plan,

207
00:10:16,729 --> 00:10:18,649
the economy would
have come close to suffering

208
00:10:18,729 --> 00:10:21,450
a double-digit recession
in the spring of 2021.

209
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:24,649
So, two things are likely true here:

210
00:10:24,729 --> 00:10:27,649
the government stimulus
did contribute to inflation,

211
00:10:27,729 --> 00:10:31,450
but it was also
a necessary intervention.

212
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:33,290
And the much bigger point is,

213
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:37,410
inflation clearly isn't just about
the stimulus at all.

214
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:40,249
After all, it's not just a problem here
in the US.

215
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:44,009
Britain and Germany have seen inflation
rates hit four decade highs,

216
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,970
and in seven Eastern European
nations,

217
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,690
it's now expected to surge
past double digits.

218
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:52,090
And in Japan, it's had particularly
dramatic consequences.

219
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:55,210
We're at an aquarium in Hakone.

220
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,810
The effects of inflation
can be felt here, too.

221
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:00,769
With the rising price of feed,

222
00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:03,249
they've chosen to use
the cheaper mackerel.

223
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:06,369
How are the penguins reacting
to the new feed?

224
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,450
It doesn't want the mackerel.

225
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,609
She tries to coax it to eat.

226
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:21,129
You don't want it?

227
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,769
The penguin doesn't like it.

228
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:27,129
No. No, it does not.
And I do not blame it.

229
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,970
I love absolutely everything about that.

230
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,570
My new favorite
genre of news segment is now

231
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:36,249
"footage of what appears to be a large,
flightless bird being a massive bitch",

232
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,570
which, now that I say it out loud, would
be a pretty accurate title for the show.

233
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:45,889
But also, demand is only one side
of this equation.

234
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,930
The other side is supply.
And to quote my therapist,

235
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:52,649
"Let's come back to that frog
spreading its legs statue."

236
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:55,290
Because in that scenario where
everyone won the lottery,

237
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:58,609
if there happened to be enough
frog statues for everyone to buy,

238
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,609
then there wouldn't be any imbalance
between supply and demand.

239
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,330
And prices would remain stable.

240
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,290
But remember: there are only three
giant statues left in stock.

241
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:09,690
And if for whatever reason,
they can't make any more,

242
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:12,489
the price of the remaining statues
will then go up.

243
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,849
Especially because there aren't
actually three of them left anymore.

244
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,290
'Cause I have one,
and it's right over here.

245
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:22,529
Look at my beautiful frog statue!

246
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,649
And crucially,
crucially, what that means is,

247
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:29,810
there are now only two
of the frog statues left.

248
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:31,930
Except, to be honest,
there aren't two,

249
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:35,489
because I have another one as well,
and it's right over there!

250
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:40,649
Look at my second frog statue!
What an absolutely perfect pair!

251
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:43,889
And what that means is that
the last remaining frog statue

252
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,690
is gonna be worth an absolute
fortune, which to be honest,

253
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:48,450
is very good news for me,

254
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:52,489
'cause I did get that one as well.
Here it is! I'm rich!

255
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:55,129
I've got all the frogs!

256
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,609
I've cornered the frog statue market!

257
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,889
I am good at business!

258
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:05,690
But look, the larger macroeconomic
point that I'm making is,

259
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:07,970
demand is certainly a factor,

260
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,970
but a smaller supply
also leads to inflation.

261
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,489
And generally speaking,

262
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,970
we've had diminished and disrupted
supplies of a lot of consumer goods,

263
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,129
primarily because,
thanks to Covid,

264
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,369
factories overseas have been shut
or have slowed down considerably.

265
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,090
Take, for instance, bicycles.

266
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,769
There has been a massive bike
shortage over the last couple of years,

267
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:29,410
thanks in large part to lockdowns
and slowdowns disrupting

268
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:31,009
bike production in China,

269
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:35,170
where roughly 90% of all bikes sold
in the US are produced.

270
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:38,249
Meanwhile,
demand for bikes soared

271
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,649
as shoppers tried to stay
active during lockdowns.

272
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:42,849
Meaning that just a few months
into the pandemic,

273
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,970
we were already seeing
stories like this.

274
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,849
Bike shops across the country now
seeing skyrocketing demand

275
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:52,210
and supplies dwindling.
In Albuquerque, New Mexico

276
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,369
This is actually the only one
we have right at the moment.

277
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,769
And in New York City

278
00:13:56,849 --> 00:13:59,210
Have you ever seen a bike
shortage like this before?

279
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,649
No, never.

280
00:14:00,729 --> 00:14:04,369
I'm selling way more pink and purple
to guys

281
00:14:04,849 --> 00:14:08,050
because they're just like, "whatever,
doesn't matter what color it is".

282
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:10,609
"It is what it is. It's a bike."

283
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:14,729
It's true. The bike shortage even
broke down gender stereotypes!

284
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:18,729
But interestingly,
while pink and purple bikes attracted

285
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,090
a new male demographic,

286
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,410
penny-farthing bikes maintained
their traditional customer base,

287
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:25,609
fancy mustachioed perverts.

288
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,249
All of which helps explain why,
last year,

289
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:32,369
the average retail price
of bike products was up 43%

290
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,849
compared to 2019.

291
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,450
Which means essentially one thing:

292
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:37,970
if you are the sort of person
who stayed active

293
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,810
and exercised during lockdown,
inflation is your fault,

294
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:44,410
and you're a terrible, terrible person.

295
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:49,649
The point is, inflation truly was
a perfect storm going into the year,

296
00:14:49,729 --> 00:14:52,050
and it seems like everything
that's happened since then

297
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:53,769
has only made it worse.

298
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:57,290
When Biden said "inflation is largely
the fault of Putin",

299
00:14:57,369 --> 00:14:59,570
that is clearly not true.

300
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,769
Inflation was happening before Putin
even invaded Ukraine,

301
00:15:02,849 --> 00:15:04,849
so that's just not how time works.

302
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:09,210
What is true, though, is that Putin
definitely exacerbated the problem.

303
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,570
The invasion of Ukraine greatly
impacted food and fuel prices,

304
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:15,529
as the world cut off its oil
purchases from Russia,

305
00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:18,009
driving gas prices,
which were already rising,

306
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:21,570
up to outrageous levels, perhaps
best summed up by this guy.

307
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:26,410
Bruh, I just got a brand-new car.
My first car.

308
00:15:26,849 --> 00:15:29,690
Now I see what you
motherfuckers are talking about

309
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:33,050
with these gas prices.
My shit was on empty.

310
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:38,529
I put 20 bucks in the fucking tank.
Look at this shit!

311
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:43,249
What the fuck? This is what
20 fucking dollars gets me?

312
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:45,649
Are you fucking kidding me?!

313
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:52,129
If I had to bet, I'd say 80% of a gas
station employee's job right now

314
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,330
is to talk people down
from exactly this situation.

315
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,690
The other 20% is, as always,
tracking down

316
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:00,369
some of the bluest drinks
you've ever seen.

317
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,849
Now, is it a good idea to sell those
in the same store

318
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,570
where you sell antifreeze?
Not for me to say.

319
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:10,489
So, Putin invading Ukraine
didn't start this inflationary cycle,

320
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,849
but it is making it worse.

321
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,090
And the same can be said
of corporate greed.

322
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:17,489
It is absolutely true that some
companies are taking advantage

323
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,810
of this environment to drive up prices,

324
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:24,050
and they're getting record profits
in return. And that is infuriating.

325
00:16:24,489 --> 00:16:26,810
But most economists will tell you,

326
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:29,769
that's not what caused inflation
in the first place.

327
00:16:29,849 --> 00:16:34,489
It's not like corporations only
just got greedy in the last two years.

328
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,849
Companies will shamelessly profiteer

329
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,529
the exact same way that a dog
will make an absolute meal

330
00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:42,609
out of its own ball sack,
if left to its own devices,

331
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,410
that's unfortunately just
what it's going to do.

332
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:50,090
So, to recap, rising prices are due
to a ton of factors,

333
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,529
a pandemic, a stimulus,
changed spending patterns,

334
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:56,290
supply chain issues, the war
in Ukraine, to name just a few.

335
00:16:56,369 --> 00:16:59,690
And anyone loudly saying
that one thing is the cause

336
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:03,009
of inflation is either lying
or has absolutely no idea

337
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,410
what they're talking about.

338
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:08,930
Whichever combination of things
got us into this mess,

339
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:11,650
the entity that many are looking
to to get us out of it

340
00:17:11,729 --> 00:17:13,130
is the Federal Reserve.

341
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,690
One of its key duties is to keep an eye
out for things that can destabilize

342
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,809
the economy, like inflation,

343
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:22,289
and control it by raising
and lowering interest rates.

344
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:26,210
Very basically, the Fed can increase
how much it costs for banks

345
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:27,410
to borrow money,

346
00:17:27,489 --> 00:17:30,410
a cost that they then pass along
to businesses and consumers,

347
00:17:30,489 --> 00:17:33,650
through higher rates on things
like mortgages and credit cards.

348
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:35,009
And the higher the interest rates,

349
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:37,610
the less inclined people
and businesses will be to borrow,

350
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,529
and the more inclined
they'll be to save.

351
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:44,170
The Fed can indirectly influence
how much people are spending.

352
00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:47,410
So, when it comes to the demand
side of the economy,

353
00:17:47,489 --> 00:17:49,249
they have some real power here.

354
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:51,410
And the fact is,
in this current crisis,

355
00:17:51,489 --> 00:17:55,690
it did arguably take too long
for the Fed to raise interest rates.

356
00:17:55,769 --> 00:17:57,729
That's something that
its chairman, Jerome Powell,

357
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:00,529
basically admitted at
a congressional hearing in March.

358
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,610
Just listen to him explain
that the Fed initially saw early signs

359
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,690
of inflation as being due to a temporary
supply shock

360
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:08,650
that would simply resolve itself.

361
00:18:08,729 --> 00:18:11,769
What the textbook says is
the shock's going to come

362
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,009
and it's going to go,
and you shouldn't react to it.

363
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:16,450
Hindsight says we should have
moved earlier,

364
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:19,890
and that turned out to be wrong.
Not maybe conceptually wrong.

365
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:24,249
But it's just taking so much longer for
the supply side to heal than we thought.

366
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:27,650
Yeah, he's right. The standard textbook
of economics says

367
00:18:27,729 --> 00:18:31,009
that if there is a supply shock,
you let it resolve itself organically.

368
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:33,410
Unfortunately, and in fairness
to the Fed,

369
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:35,850
the pandemic
was totally unprecedented,

370
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,210
so the standard textbook
just didn't apply.

371
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:41,210
In fact, the only textbook applicable
to this situation was:

372
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:43,610
"Fuck, Fuck, the Whole World
Shut Down!"

373
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,329
"What Do We Do?
God! Fuck, Fuck, Fuck!"

374
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,650
And it's not like the Fed was
alone in calling this wrong.

375
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:53,049
Most economists thought
inflation would go away on its own.

376
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,569
And some of the loudest voices
on Wall Street were arguing

377
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,729
against the Fed raising interest rates,

378
00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:00,890
because they, too, thought that
inflation would be transitory.

379
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,329
For instance, here's Jim Cramer,
the answer to the question,

380
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,089
"What if a garbage can full of cocaine
and business school pamphlets"

381
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,930
"wished to be a real boy?"

382
00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:11,569
making that very argument
in November of last year.

383
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,489
I don't think Powell needs to slam
the brakes on the economy.

384
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:18,970
Despite what you hear from
the inflationistas in the media,

385
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:22,329
the weight of the evidence
is finally going Powell's way.

386
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:27,249
Team transitory is going to win!
I say stop freaking about inflation.

387
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:30,970
Setting aside the fact that he's
speaking with an intensity level

388
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:34,809
best described as "Patti LuPone
admonishing a rude audience member",

389
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,249
it's pretty clear that this clip,
much like Jim Cramer himself,

390
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:40,289
has not aged very well.

391
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:43,489
Because here he was just six months
later, doing a full 180,

392
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:45,210
with a very different tone.

393
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,930
I think that Powell may not understand.
We gotta break this,

394
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:50,210
we've gotta break it now,

395
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:54,529
because this was the week
we realized that it is just inflamed

396
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,130
and it is not going away.

397
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,970
I was shocked.

398
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:05,650
I just didn't know that it was
as bad as it is. It's in every aisle.

399
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,690
The inflation's in every aisle.

400
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:10,970
That was a pretty dramatic turnaround.

401
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:13,329
He went from loudly unconcerned
about rising prices

402
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:16,809
to full-blown inflationista
in a matter of months.

403
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:20,289
What exactly is going on
with this expression right here?

404
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:23,370
That is not the face you make when
you're concerned about inflation.

405
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,850
That's the face you make when
you're watching a giraffe give birth.

406
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:31,170
The fact is, a lot of smart people,
and Jim Cramer,

407
00:20:31,249 --> 00:20:32,890
read this situation wrong.

408
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,769
And there isn't really a roadmap
for what to do next.

409
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,809
As one Wall Street Journal columnist
has said,

410
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,489
"Economic models that worked
for decades broke down"

411
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:43,650
"during the pandemic, and alternatives
have yet to emerge."

412
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:47,450
Now, one thing that would really help
is if we knew the extent to which

413
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:49,930
this is a supply
or a demand problem.

414
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:53,370
If it's more about too much money
or not enough stuff.

415
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:57,930
Because if it is too much money,
the Fed can impact that pretty easily.

416
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:00,970
What they'd want to do is raise
interest rates significantly enough

417
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:02,729
to curb spending and slow growth,

418
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:07,210
but not so aggressively that it would
then trigger a painful recession.

419
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:09,249
But if it's about not
enough stuff instead,

420
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:12,890
if the major issues are things
like supply chain disruptions,

421
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,569
the effect the Fed can have
is drastically reduced.

422
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,370
Because the Fed can't stop the war
in Ukraine,

423
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,769
or open factories in China
that are closed due to Covid.

424
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:25,489
I suppose Jerome Powell could lead
an army of economists into Luhansk,

425
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,049
but I'm not sure anyone wants
to see that,

426
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,769
and historically, that hasn't
been the Fed's role.

427
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,769
So, the question of whether inflation
is caused more by supply

428
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,970
or demand basically determines
how much influence

429
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:39,489
the Fed has to improve things.

430
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:42,890
Unfortunately, even economists
don't really agree

431
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,249
on which is the bigger driver here.

432
00:21:45,329 --> 00:21:49,289
Meaning the truth is inflation
may not be fully within our control.

433
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:53,210
Which isn't to say that Biden hasn't
been out there promising to combat it

434
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:55,610
and showing empathy
for Americans who are struggling,

435
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,329
sometimes in the
weirdest way possible.

436
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:03,809
I want every American to know that
I'm taking inflation very seriously,

437
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,130
and it's my top domestic priority.

438
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:11,890
I know you gotta be frustrated.
I know. I can taste it.

439
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:17,009
No, no, no, no, no!
Never say that again!

440
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:21,329
That may have been the single grossest
thing I've ever heard come out

441
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,529
of Joe Biden's mouth,
and that is saying a lot,

442
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,329
cause I've heard the stuff
he used to say in the 1970s.

443
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:31,089
But to be fair, I do get why
Biden is taking this approach.

444
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:34,729
Americans view inflation
as the top problem facing the US

445
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:36,529
ahead of the midterm elections,

446
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,170
ahead of every other calamity facing
the country, including Ezra Miller.

447
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:44,569
And there is an argument
for trying to raise public confidence.

448
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,690
Once an inflationary cycle starts,

449
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:50,650
simply the expectation of it
can keep inflation going.

450
00:22:50,729 --> 00:22:52,569
For instance,
as the cost of living rises,

451
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,289
workers might demand
higher wages to cover that,

452
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,450
which in turn, raises the cost of labor,

453
00:22:57,529 --> 00:22:59,970
leading businesses
to charge higher prices,

454
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:03,450
leading to still more inflation.
It's basically a vicious cycle.

455
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:06,970
That is why the worse
our inflation expectations are,

456
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:08,729
the worse it can get.

457
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:10,890
And that may help
explain why the Fed,

458
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,489
albeit late,
is now taking some big steps.

459
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:18,450
It recently enacted the biggest increase
to interest rates since 1994.

460
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:21,690
And it's all but certain that
it'll raise them again next week.

461
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:24,529
Meanwhile, Jerome Powell has been
trying to reassure people

462
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,210
that the Fed has things under control,

463
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:28,850
although he has also notably
gone from talking about

464
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,769
trying to engineer a soft landing
for the economy,

465
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,890
to something slightly different.

466
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:38,089
So, I would say there are a number
of plausible paths

467
00:23:38,569 --> 00:23:42,650
to having a soft or, as I've said,
soft-ish landing.

468
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,890
So, we're aiming for a soft-ish
landing now, are we, Jerome?

469
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:50,170
The thing is, "ish" isn't
exactly the most reassuring suffix

470
00:23:50,249 --> 00:23:53,049
to hear when you're discussing
something so serious.

471
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,410
There is a huge difference
between a surgeon telling you,

472
00:23:55,489 --> 00:23:59,049
"The surgery went well",
and, "It went well-ish".

473
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:03,170
I don't know where things are
going to go from here, exactly.

474
00:24:03,249 --> 00:24:05,370
I am not a monetary policy wonk,

475
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,529
even though my clothing, glasses,
haircut,

476
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,130
and general vibe
would strongly beg to differ.

477
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,130
Although, for what it's worth,

478
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:15,049
there have been some small
encouraging developments recently,

479
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,610
among other things, gas prices
have been dropping,

480
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:21,130
and long-term inflation
expectations recently ticked down

481
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,930
after the Fed's intervention.

482
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:26,210
Most economists now expect
this wave of inflation to pass

483
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:27,970
in a year or 18 months,

484
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,610
although that is
by no means certain,

485
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:33,970
and importantly, that's an incredibly
long time for those suffering the most.

486
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:37,249
Because for all of our discussion
tonight of supply and demand curves,

487
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:40,370
it is really important to
remember that inflation's effects

488
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:43,529
are anything but abstract for those
that it's hitting the hardest,

489
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:46,489
like this woman, describing
shopping with her kids.

490
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:50,850
They see it when I'm in line
and I'm like calculating in my head

491
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,850
and looking at my groceries.

492
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:56,089
I have my calculator out,
like, doing the tax.

493
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,930
What is this going to come to?

494
00:24:58,009 --> 00:25:01,410
Or I'm putting things back
as we get closer in line.

495
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,289
And my oldest daughter is, like,
looking at me

496
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,450
and then she's putting something back.

497
00:25:08,769 --> 00:25:10,610
It breaks your heart a little bit.

498
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,410
Of course. Kids shouldn't have
to worry about putting food

499
00:25:13,489 --> 00:25:16,009
back on the shelves because
they can't afford it.

500
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:18,450
Kids should do what they
are meant to at the grocery store,

501
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:21,729
go over to the big bin of rubber balls
that are inexplicably sold there

502
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:24,210
and cause absolute mayhem.

503
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:28,089
So, the next year is likely to be very
hard for a lot of people.

504
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:31,690
Which is why what we should definitely
be doing right now is helping them.

505
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:34,009
One of the best ways to
help low-income families

506
00:25:34,089 --> 00:25:36,529
would be to pass a refundable
child tax credit

507
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,809
for those who need it. And I know
that that might be hard,

508
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,529
especially in an atmosphere where
government spending

509
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,489
is being blamed for fueling inflation.

510
00:25:43,569 --> 00:25:45,329
But it could be narrowly targeted,

511
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:49,289
while also fully offset with
higher taxes on higher earners.

512
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,529
We could also expand
rental assistance,

513
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,930
something that economists say would
have a minimal impact

514
00:25:54,009 --> 00:25:58,370
on driving inflation further up, while
also keeping people in their homes.

515
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:01,009
Look, things are obviously
pretty bad right now.

516
00:26:01,089 --> 00:26:03,489
Families are struggling,
penguins are pissed,

517
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:06,329
and Jim Cramer looks like
he just shit himself.

518
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:09,690
And there is still
a lot of uncertainty here.

519
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:12,529
But there are also two things
that we do know for sure.

520
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:16,009
One, it's going to take a difficult
combination of monetary policy,

521
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:18,089
supply chain recovery, and time

522
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,529
to bring supply
and demand back into alignment.

523
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:24,410
And two, that if everyone does win
the lottery in the future,

524
00:26:24,489 --> 00:26:27,170
and does suddenly want
some frog statues,

525
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:31,170
I just made the smartest investment
of all time.

526
00:26:31,249 --> 00:26:35,930
I am the Warren Buffett
of frogs! And now, this.

527
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:41,210
And Now: Local News Reacts to the
Consequences of Global Warming

528
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:43,370
Exactly As Expected.

529
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,850
As hip-hop sensation Nelly once said,

530
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:52,329
"It's hot in, so hot in here."
But just how hot is it, Elizabeth?

531
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:56,370
It is so hot outside, Karsen,
how hot is it?

532
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,809
It's so hot I bought a loaf of bread,
Chase, before I got home, it was toast!

533
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:05,130
It is so hot, I saw a dog chasing a cat,
and they were both walking.

534
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:08,089
It's so hot, yesterday,
I saw the devil sitting by the AC.

535
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,289
How hot is it?

536
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:15,130
I almost called my ex-girlfriend just
so I could be around something shady.

537
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,769
How hot is it gonna be, Mark?

538
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,210
I think I'm going to see
a chicken lay an omelet.

539
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:21,690
My ex-girlfriend's heart is melting.

540
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:25,009
Adam and Eve are gonna trade
their fig leaves for ice cubes.

541
00:27:25,089 --> 00:27:27,769
- London is so hot
- How hot is it?

542
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,249
They're canceling flights today.

543
00:27:29,329 --> 00:27:31,410
And he says they're doing better
in Spain,

544
00:27:31,489 --> 00:27:33,049
where it's 90 degrees today.

545
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:37,410
Yesterday, he said it was 97,
humidity around 100%.

546
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:42,769
Moving on. Before we go,

547
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,249
a quick update on something that
we mentioned during the break.

548
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:46,850
Specifically, dolls.

549
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:50,049
The single weirdest thing to bring
to a job interview.

550
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,329
"I went to UNC,
but Liliana went to Tulane."

551
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:56,489
Over the July Fourth weekend,
we released a web piece

552
00:27:56,569 --> 00:27:59,529
about the fact that certain creepy dolls
have been washing up

553
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,850
on a particular stretch of beach
in Texas.

554
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,890
And each one of them is a legitimate
horror show,

555
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:07,930
from Green Pirate Baby,
to Nightmare Ghoul Baby,

556
00:28:08,009 --> 00:28:11,009
to Barnacle Baby One, Two,
and Three.

557
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:14,489
Honestly, I now see these demons
everywhere.

558
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:17,769
In the mirror?
Suddenly, there's a doll behind me.

559
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,690
In the stunning, humbling images from
the James Webb space telescope

560
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:23,210
another doll.

561
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:27,410
I'm 45 years old. I've encountered
a wide breadth of emotions.

562
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:29,610
But not until I saw these
things did I experience

563
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,410
the feeling of being hunted.

564
00:28:31,489 --> 00:28:34,970
And I will say, it seems like the local
news in Texas did appreciate

565
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:37,729
us giving their plight some attention.

566
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:42,130
This is a little creepy. It's happening
along the beaches in South Texas.

567
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,249
And while, you know,
anything can wash up on shore,

568
00:28:46,329 --> 00:28:48,769
these dolls are really
turning heads.

569
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:52,289
Recently, the trend caught the eye
of HBO's John Oliver,

570
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:57,130
who offered up his own solution
for what he calls the demon dolls.

571
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:00,170
Burn them! Burn them now!

572
00:29:00,249 --> 00:29:03,729
Yeah, I said that, and you know
what? I stand by that sentiment.

573
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:07,210
Our idea wasn't just that the dolls
should be burned.

574
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:09,450
It's that the coastal reserve
that keeps finding them

575
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:12,009
should sell them to us
and allow us to find

576
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:13,650
an appropriate way to dispose of them.

577
00:29:13,729 --> 00:29:17,289
So, we offered 10 000 dollars
to their turtle hospital

578
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:20,329
if they sent us every remaining plastic
beast that they had.

579
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,410
And apparently,
they got the message.

580
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:26,329
If I sent him all the dolls that I have,

581
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:29,769
they were gonna donate
10 000 dollars,

582
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,610
and then they were gonna
destroy all the dolls.

583
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,970
And I thought, "That sounds
really good to me".

584
00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:39,130
The Amos Rehabilitation Keep
that rehabs the sea turtles,

585
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,529
they're pretty much run
on donations from the community,

586
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,769
so 10 000 dollars can go
a long way

587
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,529
and save hundreds of sea
turtles, so I'm all about that.

588
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:50,809
Me too! Sure, yeah, totally.

589
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:55,210
I like sea turtles.
I think they're fun, round little guys.

590
00:29:55,289 --> 00:29:59,370
But was that my main objective here?
No. Of course it fucking wasn't.

591
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:03,089
This was mainly about saving
the planet from the heinous scourge

592
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,850
of these plastic beach demons.

593
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,410
Anyway, we began
a correspondence with that man,

594
00:30:07,489 --> 00:30:11,249
including, at one point, him sending us
this photo of the available dolls.

595
00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:14,210
Which is really bad. That's just
a really bad way to do things.

596
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:18,170
A bucket is the single worst place
to keep these dolls,

597
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:22,170
other than at a hospital in bassinets
right next to real babies.

598
00:30:22,249 --> 00:30:26,089
But we kept up our end of the deal.
We sent the turtle rehab the money,

599
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,970
and in return, they sent us the dolls.

600
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:30,009
Now, we were actually on break
when that happened,

601
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:33,690
so one of our staff members had
them shipped directly to her home,

602
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:37,890
meaning that she had,
where she lives, this box.

603
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:41,130
And you know what? I take it
back. The bucket was actually fine.

604
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,809
This box is a much worse place
to keep them.

605
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:48,009
But the fact is, we are now in
possession of this large bucket

606
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,769
full of my worst nightmares.

607
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:56,370
This may be the single creepiest thing
that has ever been in this building,

608
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,089
which is really saying something

609
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:00,729
because Charlie Rose used
to work down the hall.

610
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:03,249
But before we get into what
we are going to do with them,

611
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:06,729
we actually have
a second quick update for you.

612
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:10,529
You may remember that we have
another outstanding offer on the table.

613
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:14,329
Back in June, we discussed
this giant Australian banana,

614
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,769
which was installed in the city
of Yarra, in Melbourne,

615
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,249
as part of a city council project
to slow down traffic.

616
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:23,450
But it was sadly removed after
someone vandalized it with a saw.

617
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:25,489
Now, there was some controversy
over the banana,

618
00:31:25,569 --> 00:31:29,049
especially because Yarra apparently
spent 22 000 dollars on it.

619
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:32,489
So, we offered to buy it for 10 dollars

620
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:35,569
plus a 10 000 dollar donation
to their local food bank

621
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,850
and a 5 000 dollar donation

622
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,009
to The John Oliver
Koala Chlamydia Ward.

623
00:31:40,089 --> 00:31:41,289
But that's not all.

624
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:45,370
We also offered our "giant alligator
giving the finger" statue

625
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,890
as a replacement for them.

626
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,930
It was a pretty good deal.
And you should know,

627
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:51,329
we actually just heard back from Yarra.

628
00:31:51,729 --> 00:31:54,690
Hi, John, I'm Sophie Wade,
the mayor of the city of Yarra,

629
00:31:54,769 --> 00:31:56,009
in Melbourne.

630
00:31:56,089 --> 00:31:58,610
We were thrilled to receive your offer
to provide a home

631
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:01,289
for our beloved yet
beleaguered banana statue.

632
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,370
After much consideration, however,
we must decline your offer.

633
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,329
Public art is an
investment in local artists,

634
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:10,089
the community, and the
vibrancy of our streets,

635
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,489
so it shouldn't be privatized
and kept in an office.

636
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:16,610
Okay, first, I wouldn't call this
"public art" so much as I'd call it

637
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,450
"the final boss in Donkey Kong".

638
00:32:18,529 --> 00:32:20,569
But let's agree to disagree there.
But second,

639
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,410
that was obviously disappointing
for me to hear.

640
00:32:22,489 --> 00:32:25,210
Although she did have
a follow-up suggestion.

641
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,370
We would love to offer your
belligerent alligator a new home

642
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,690
here in Melbourne.

643
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:31,729
We know you'll be disappointed
about the banana.

644
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:33,130
Who wouldn't be?

645
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:37,970
So, as compensation, we will name our
polystyrene recycling machine after you.

646
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:41,249
It turns trash into treasure,
makes a lot of noise,

647
00:32:41,329 --> 00:32:43,769
and nerds love it.
So, it seems fitting.

648
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:46,650
We hope our counteroffer
is appealing.

649
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:50,569
Okay, first, solid burn. Second,
don't particularly care for the pun.

650
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,850
And third, now we're talking!

651
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,049
Because before watching that video,
I didn't realize that I wanted

652
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,529
my name attached to a machine
that vigorously churns out

653
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,850
a substance that looks like
someone just stuffed

654
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:04,489
Snoopy through a sausage maker.
But it turns out, I want it very badly.

655
00:33:04,569 --> 00:33:07,769
In fact, I now have a counter
to your counteroffer.

656
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:11,690
Because to be clear, I am not offering
you my alligator statue anymore.

657
00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:14,370
That went off the table as soon
as you denied me the banana.

658
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,289
No banana, no alligator.

659
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:21,289
But I am still willing to send
10 000 dollars to your food bank,

660
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:25,089
and 5 000
to the Koala Chlamydia Ward

661
00:33:25,569 --> 00:33:27,610
if you name that recycling machine
after me

662
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,610
and, and this is non-negotiable,

663
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:33,930
you take this bucket of hellish
dolls and run them

664
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:36,410
through your machine
to destroy them forever.

665
00:33:36,489 --> 00:33:40,370
I can think of no better way
to rid the world of this menace.

666
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:43,249
And if you're sad that you're not
getting the alligator, don't worry.

667
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:45,089
I also have a consolation prize.

668
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:50,009
Because I will throw in these
three glorious frog statues,

669
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:52,569
which will only appreciate in value.

670
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:55,410
You have exactly one week
to get back to us.

671
00:33:55,489 --> 00:33:57,890
I await your response with interest,
Yarra!

672
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,890
That is our show.
Thank you so much for watching.

673
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,370
We'll see you next week.
Good night!
