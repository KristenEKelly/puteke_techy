00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,679
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,600
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight"!
I'm John Oliver.

3
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,640
Thank you so much for joining us.
It's been another busy week,

4
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,079
with the world's attention
still focused on Ukraine,

5
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:42,799
the place you now think about so much,
you know exactly where it is.

6
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:45,079
News from Ukraine has been grim,

7
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:48,079
with Russian forces reportedly
firing at evacuees trying to flee,

8
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:50,240
and airstrikes
hitting a maternity hospital.

9
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,520
And things may be poised
to get even worse now,

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,439
as Russia is now falsely claiming

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,119
biological weapons
are being developed in Ukraine,

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,320
which, as Ukraine's president
points out, often means one thing.

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,640
Allegedly, we are preparing
a chemical attack?!

14
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,120
This makes me really worried.
We've been repeatedly convinced,

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,959
if you want to know Russia's plans,
look at what Russia accuses others of.

16
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,319
If you want to know Russia's plans,
look at what it's accusing others of.

17
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,599
That is pretty good advice there,

18
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,640
along with, "When people tell you
who they are, believe them",

19
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:24,519
and, "If a man looks
like a porn parody of a Bond villain,

20
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:27,079
maybe assume everything he says
is horseshit."

21
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,920
We're taping this on Saturday,
and the situation is moving so fast,

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,959
who knows what'll have happened
by the time you see this?

23
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,120
So, we're actually going
to turn our focus tonight to the U.S.

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,159
where it's been a bleak few weeks
for the LGBTQ community.

25
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:41,599
In addition to Greg Abbott's
recent order in Texas,

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,439
targeting the parents
of transgender kids,

27
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,840
hostile bills were introduced
across 33 states last year,

28
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,879
and that number
is continuing to grow.

29
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,480
This week, the focus fell on Florida,
where Ron DeSantis,

30
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,120
the twin Kyle Chandler
should have eaten in the womb,

31
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,480
has been pushing
a "parental rights in education" bill

32
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,799
popularly known as Don't Say Gay,
a framing though he takes exception to.

33
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,959
What critics call the Don't Say Gay
bill is on the Senate floor today.

34
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,920
- Does it say that in the bill?
- We know that you support.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,159
- Does it say that in the bill?
- I am asking you...

36
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,000
Tell me what's in the bill because
you are pushing false narratives.

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,719
It doesn't matter what critics say.

38
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,680
It says it bans classroom instruction on
sexual identity and gender orientation.

39
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,080
- For who?
- For K through three.

40
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,080
For grades pre-K through three.

41
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,240
We're going to make sure

42
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,960
that parents are able
to send their kid to kindergarten

43
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:31,719
without having some of this stuff
injected into their school curriculum.

44
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,800
I'm just gonna say it,

45
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:37,800
that may be the angriest anyone
has ever been at a strawberry festival.

46
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,400
But since
he's claiming false narrative there,

47
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,240
let's talk about
what this bill would actually do.

48
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,639
Because its supporters claim
it only bans "instruction,"

49
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,080
not "discussion" of sexual orientation
and gender identity.

50
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,840
But that still leaves teachers
wondering where to draw the line,

51
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:53,840
and how they're supposed to handle
questions about same-sex parents,

52
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,520
or drawing a family tree, or even
basic facts about their own lives,

53
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,560
as this kindergarten teacher explains.

54
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,960
Cory says teachers at his school are
encouraged to display their families,

55
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:06,319
as he does of his partner, Jeremiah.

56
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,240
Am I going to be allowed
to tell them this is my partner?

57
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,360
What if they ask me,
"What does that mean?"

58
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:14,560
Am I going to be allowed
to have that discussion with them?

59
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,039
Right! That's gonna be an issue.

60
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,199
Because kids ask questions
all the fucking time.

61
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:23,680
Like, "Where do babies come from?"
and "What happens when we die?"

62
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:26,400
and "Why can't anyone else
see the old lady in the window?"

63
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,919
They just won't stop.
There's nobody there.

64
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,240
Also, it is not actually
just K through three,

65
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,800
the bill also limits
any instruction on these issues

66
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,719
for grades four and above to what is
"age or developmentally appropriate",

67
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,759
without defining
what that actually means.

68
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,159
And the worry is that teachers

69
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,560
will feel that they have to steer clear
of those topics altogether,

70
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,120
especially as the bill
allows parents to sue

71
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,000
if they think their children
have received inappropriate lessons.

72
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,479
And while you will hear idiots
saying that this bill

73
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,560
is to prevent kindergarteners
getting taught about sex,

74
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,639
with Ron DeSantis's campaign
even arguing

75
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:00,360
it'll stop "R-rated lessons
about sexuality,"

76
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,719
the wording
is much broader than that.

77
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,240
And when one state senator
did try to narrow it

78
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,639
and amend the bill to pertain

79
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,280
only to "discussion about human
sexuality or sexual activity,"

80
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,680
adding, "If the intent
is not to marginalize anyone.

81
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:16,639
Let's make sure we aren't,"
Dennis Baxley, the bill's sponsor,

82
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
rejected that amendment,

83
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,000
saying it would "significantly gut"
the legislation.

84
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,160
So, it's pretty clear what he thinks
the guts of this legislation are.

85
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,759
It's not about sex at all, it's about
denying the existence of gay people.

86
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,040
And what's particularly galling here
is the support that Baxley

87
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,240
and some of the Republican legislators
who voted for this bill

88
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,879
have had from corporate America.

89
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:40,560
AT&T, our soon to be ex-business
daddy, has donated to them.

90
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,399
But one of the biggest donors here
is actually Disney.

91
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,439
In the last two years,
it's given nearly $300,000

92
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,279
to DeSantis and the legislators
that voted for this bill.

93
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,879
Are they morally bankrupt
for doing that?

94
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,040
Who's to say?
I'll tell you, I am. I am to say.

95
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,199
After all, I'm Zazu.

96
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,720
No, not that one.
No, not the fun one.

97
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Yeah, that's me!

98
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:05,839
The fussy little dead-eyed bird
who ruins everyone's day. This guy!

99
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,439
Disney employees were understandably
outraged when this came to light,

100
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,199
and Bob Chapek, Disney's CEO
and business thumb,

101
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,720
then made things worse,

102
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,439
putting out a statement defending
Disney's silence on the bill,

103
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:19,480
and listing a bunch of Disney projects
like "Encanto," "Black Panther,"

104
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,399
"Modern Family,"
and "Summer of Soul," saying,

105
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,279
"These and all of our diverse stories
are our corporate statements,

106
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,800
and they are more powerful
than any Tweet or lobbying effort."

107
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,120
And that is obviously nonsense,
although I will say,

108
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,040
"Encanto" is actually an apt reference,
given what is happening in Florida.

109
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,560
Because its catchiest song
is, of course,

110
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,399
about everyone refusing to talk
about one member of their family,

111
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,480
which sounds like a lesson plan
designed by Ron DeSantis

112
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,160
specifically for that kindergarten
teacher from earlier.

113
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,720
And here is the thing:

114
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,639
generally, movies can affect
how people view the world.

115
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,160
But is this really a path
that you want to go down, Disney?

116
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,600
Because you are the same company

117
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,759
that's coded basically
every villain in your movies as gay,

118
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,399
stereotyped minorities
to a breathtaking degree,

119
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,199
and had something called
a "wench auction" in place

120
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,839
at Disneyland until 2018.

121
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:11,000
I don't know if you've had
a 100 percent net positive effect here.

122
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,319
Chapek's statement
did not go over well.

123
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,079
And a few days later,
on a shareholder call,

124
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,399
he took another swing, expressing
opposition to the bill and saying this.

125
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,519
When we donate money
to different political candidates,

126
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,040
we have no idea how they're going
to vote going forward into the future.

127
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,879
That is such bullshit
it is actively insulting.

128
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,399
'Cause that's just not
how donating works.

129
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,639
When you donate money,

130
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,959
you generally know what the recipient
is going to do with it.

131
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,560
That is why people give
to Feeding America

132
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,079
and not Feeding America
or Maybe Take Food Away from America

133
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,879
and Put it in a Big Hole,
Who Really Knows?

134
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:49,199
Disney should absolutely
have had a pretty good idea

135
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,800
how Dennis Baxley would vote
when they gave him money,

136
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:55,399
given that he's not been shy about
sharing his views on a host of topics.

137
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,519
He once suggested

138
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,040
"abortion is causing Europeans
to be replaced by immigrants

139
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,240
and is paving the way
for the end of western civilization,"

140
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,240
and as recently as 2020,
he joined others in filing bills

141
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,720
to "repeal protections
for LGBTQ workers,

142
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,959
and legalize
gay conversion therapy."

143
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,040
And he also once said this.

144
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,439
I know some districts
where there's a big infestation

145
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,279
of homosexuals that are pushing
their agenda under the screen

146
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,839
and they try and get more people hired
that are like them,

147
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,399
and set up gay adoptions,
and all this stuff.

148
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,199
So, it's a continual fight
for the values that we hold dear.

149
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,639
So, there's a lot to unpack there,

150
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,439
from the decor which screams
"Christmas in hospice"

151
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:44,279
to the disgusting
use of the word "infestation,"

152
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,319
to the fact that he's talking
about stopping gay adoption

153
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,319
in front of a Ronald Reagan
quote that says,

154
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,480
"Man is not free
unless government is limited."

155
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,319
An irony seemingly
completely lost on Dennis there.

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,439
Chapek then took a third swing
at an apology on Friday,

157
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,240
saying that Disney was pausing
all its political giving in Florida,

158
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,800
pending a review, and promising,
"I am an ally you can count on,"

159
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:06,639
for which the jury
is very much out.

160
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,240
But when this bill passes,
as seems inevitable,

161
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,240
the harm will have been done.

162
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,399
That kindergarten teacher,

163
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,279
who is wearing a fucking Mickey Mouse
T-shirt in that photo with his partner,

164
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,120
will have been betrayed
by a company whose work he loves.

165
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,439
For all Chapek's self-congratulation

166
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,639
about how Disney movies
like "Black Panther"

167
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,839
can instigate change,
that change clearly has its limits,

168
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,040
given that just this week, news broke
that the movie's director Ryan Coogler

169
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,840
had been handcuffed by police

170
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,559
while trying to withdraw money
from his own bank account.

171
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,360
Marginalized creators have made
billions of dollars for Disney.

172
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,519
Now, should it embarrass them
that it took them until this week

173
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,440
to realize that they shouldn't take
that money

174
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:47,639
and use it to actively undermine
those creators' interests?

175
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,799
Who's to say? I'll tell you, I am.
I'm Zazu, remember?

176
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,159
And while I haven't been invited back
for the prequel yet,

177
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,039
after tonight, I've got
a pretty good feeling about it.

178
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,720
And now, this!

179
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:05,399
And Now, Jim Cramer Presents:
Grounds for Divorce.

180
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,559
Let's start with Wendy's.

181
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,440
I like Wendy's,
and not just because my wife

182
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,240
can put away a double Baconator
quicker than anyone.

183
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,600
They've highlighted my wife eating
a juicy Baconator all over her car.

184
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:19,240
My wife is, with this Baconator,
she's crazy about it,

185
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,200
she doesn't even care,
it's like, boom.

186
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,200
All right. Anyway.
My wife had a Baconator, holy cow.

187
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,080
That's tough to work off.

188
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,960
My wife had a Baconator
during vacation,

189
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:30,840
which is obviously
a bulk-up situation.

190
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,759
My wife championed that Baconator,
which, you know,

191
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,519
you gotta go to Planet Fitness
right after.

192
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,679
My wife's a Wendy's person.
She likes the Baconator.

193
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:40,000
My wife just loves the Baconator.

194
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
I know your wife
likes to trade in to that Baconator

195
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,120
on a regular occasion,
so we love that, too.

196
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,960
She loves the Baconator!

197
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:49,080
I did have to stop my wife yesterday
from getting a Baconator.

198
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,639
I said, "Enough is enough!"

199
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,639
It was trading
in the mid-single digits,

200
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,080
and that was because my wife
liked the Baconator,

201
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,639
she actually likes
the double cheese Baconator.

202
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,279
Once again, happy birth...
happy birthday to Lisa!

203
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,519
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns live entertainment.

204
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,159
It's one of the things that people
missed the most during the pandemic,

205
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,919
and everyone was very excited
to see it start to come back.

206
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,960
It's been more
than a year without them,

207
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,840
but now the Hampton Colosseum
is bringing back concerts.

208
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:24,799
I'm pumped, I'm ready to go,
I'm vaccinated, I'm ready to go.

209
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,559
I've been locked up
for a year and 10 months

210
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:30,200
and now I'm gonna let loose
and destroy this place.

211
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,440
Let him have that. Everyone missed
their comforts during the pandemic.

212
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,120
I can guarantee that the sentence

213
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,000
"I've been locked up
for a year and 10 months

214
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,000
and now I'm here
to destroy this place"

215
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,320
was also said several times at the
re-opening of an Ann Taylor Loft.

216
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,200
Everyone's been a bit edgy.

217
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,399
Live entertainment
undeniably offers unique experiences,

218
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,480
from Taylor Swift
unveiling her squad,

219
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,919
to a hologram Tupac
performing at Coachella,

220
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,679
to this unsurpassed moment
from a Justin Bieber concert.

221
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:06,840
Good. I'm glad that happened.

222
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:11,000
And while it is amazing
to watch that together now,

223
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,679
just imagine being there
to see it live in person.

224
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,840
But if you've bought or even tried
to buy tickets recently,

225
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:19,159
you know those experiences
come at a cost.

226
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,039
I just spent the last hour and 15
minutes trying to get P!nk tickets.

227
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,759
If you don't want
to be behind the stage,

228
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,720
you're looking
at $500 per ticket.

229
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,320
Who can afford that?

230
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:36,720
For the amount that I'm paying
to see any random band on tour,

231
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,960
they better
be fucking serenading me.

232
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,399
Why are Bad Bunny tickets
so damn expensive?

233
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:47,960
Y'all making me want to sell
my husband's feet on OnlyFans!

234
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,399
That is a striking sentiment there.
Actually, hold on, hold on.

235
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,879
For sale. Husband feet.
OnlyFans. Yes! We did it!

236
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,080
We created a whole story
in just five words.

237
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,720
Suck it, Hemingway! Suck it!

238
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:06,159
If you think tickets have been getting
ridiculously expensive, they have.

239
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,720
The average price for a popular concert
has more than tripled since the mid '90s

240
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,519
vastly outpacing inflation.

241
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,919
And that is before
they hit the resale market.

242
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,240
And with huge artists starting to put
tickets on sale for summer shows,

243
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,480
that irritation is only likely
to increase.

244
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,279
So tonight,
we thought we'd try and explain

245
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,279
exactly why Bad Bunny tickets
are so expensive,

246
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,240
who is making money off them, and
what you might be able to do about it

247
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,960
that does not involve
selling your husband's feet.

248
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,639
And let's start with the company
that you're immediately thinking of:

249
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,840
Ticketmaster.

250
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,120
They are the biggest player
in the ticket market, by far,

251
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,559
and claim they strive
to put fans first,

252
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,440
and that "the people
we care most about are the fans."

253
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:47,120
And yet, as anyone who has ever
bought a ticket from them knows,

254
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,039
that's generally not the feeling
you get when dealing with them,

255
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,600
as this YouTuber explains.

256
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,039
If there was anything
that I had as a wish,

257
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,440
for any big artist
or band that comes through,

258
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,399
whether it's K-pop,
whether it's a western artist,

259
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,480
I don't give a shit
if you're a magician,

260
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,360
any big ticket person that ever
comes through and does a concert,

261
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,159
never use Ticketmaster.

262
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,919
Use literally anyone else.
They are terrible.

263
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,480
Okay, first, excellent shade
thrown at magicians there.

264
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,960
It was noted,
and it was appreciated.

265
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:22,559
But they're right, Ticketmaster is one
of the most hated companies on earth,

266
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,840
which is really impressive,
'cause remember,

267
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:27,960
this is a planet
in which AT&T also exists.

268
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,080
Hey guys, we've still got a few weeks
till the merger goes through,

269
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:34,080
and I've gotta say,
it's gonna be a bumpy ride until then.

270
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:36,240
And also after.

271
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,519
And look, it is no secret
Ticketmaster is horrible.

272
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,720
But exactly how it is horrible
is genuinely interesting.

273
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:45,759
And let's start with one of the things
that infuriates people most about them,

274
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,879
the fees.

275
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,559
They can come as a nasty surprise
at the very end of a transaction

276
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:52,919
and can range from the annoying
to the completely batshit.

277
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,919
We found a ticket
to a 2019 Kidz Bop concert

278
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,120
with fees that amounted
to 75% of face value.

279
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,720
For one ticket to a Tyler the Creator
show next week,

280
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,519
the fees add an extra 78 percent.

281
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,679
And the fees on a $15 ticket
to a monster truck rally in Houston

282
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:09,799
were $16.41.

283
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:12,320
That's more than the cost
of the ticket itself!

284
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:16,000
Which is ridiculous. Although I will say
in the case of that Kidz Bop tour,

285
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,039
it might actually have been worth it,
because they could've played this.

286
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:22,399
I just took a DNA test,
turns out

287
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,360
I'm 100% that kid
even when I'm crying crazy.

288
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,799
Yeah, I got some problems,
that's the human in me.

289
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:31,559
Bling, bling, then I solve 'em,
that's the goddess in me.

290
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:34,679
You coulda had a good friend,
non-committal.

291
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:37,159
Help you
with your career just a little.

292
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:41,320
Stop it!
Stop it right now and forever!

293
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:44,159
I have so many issues
with what you just saw,

294
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,320
the least of which
is what they did to the lyrics.

295
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,679
Because if you are saying,

296
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,679
"Took a DNA test turns out
I'm 100 percent that kid,"

297
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,519
you're either settling
a paternity dispute on "Maury,"

298
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,279
or returning to your hometown after
having been kidnapped 30 years ago.

299
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,960
"I swear, guys! I took a DNA test,
turns out I'm 100 percent that kid!"

300
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:06,639
And while it is both easy and fun
to shit on Ticketmaster for their fees,

301
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,559
as they point out, they're not
solely responsible for them.

302
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,639
Instead, they say,

303
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,080
"Ticket fees are determined
in collaboration with our clients,"

304
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,799
who "share in a portion
of the fees we collect."

305
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:18,639
Which is true.
Ticketmaster enters into contracts

306
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,840
that set and share fees with the venues
where concerts are held,

307
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:24,840
the promoters who book,
market, and organize the shows,

308
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:26,919
and sometimes
even the artists themselves.

309
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,879
You could say Ticketmaster's business
model is to stand in as the bad guy

310
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,399
and let all those other players
hide behind them.

311
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,399
Or you could not say that,
and let Ticketmaster's former CEO

312
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,639
basically admit it
directly to Congress.

313
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,600
When people hear what Ticketmaster's
service charge is,

314
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:46,080
Ticketmaster was set up as a system
where they took the heat for everybody.

315
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,559
In that service charge are the credit
card fees, the rebates to the buildings,

316
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:52,679
rebates sometimes to artists,
sometimes rebates to promoters.

317
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,639
Ticketmaster has been like the IRS.
We deliver bad news.

318
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,279
It's true.

319
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,840
Ticketmaster is very much like the IRS
in that it's an opaque bureaucracy,

320
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,840
takes more out of your paycheck
than you think it should,

321
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:07,200
and is represented by men
so catastrophically uncharismatic

322
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,600
they look like they're putting
themselves to sleep.

323
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,080
Although it is worth knowing that,

324
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:13,840
while Ticketmaster
does share fees with other parties,

325
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,639
some of those other parties
may also be Ticketmaster.

326
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,000
Because just one year after
that hearing,

327
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,799
they completed a gigantic merger
with Live Nation,

328
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:25,840
which owns or operates many
of the country's top music venues,

329
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,120
and call themselves,

330
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,159
"the largest producer of live music
concerts in the world,"

331
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,440
and since then, they've had something
of a chokehold on live entertainment.

332
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,399
In fact, the DOJ recently alleged
that the company had repeatedly

333
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,840
"strong-armed venues
into using Ticketmaster,"

334
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:41,360
and "retaliated against
or threatened venues"

335
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,960
that did not use its services.

336
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,559
While Live Nation denies that, there is
no denying just how much power it has.

337
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,879
Even before that merger,
Pearl Jam, at the height of their fame,

338
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,879
tried to do a tour without Ticketmaster
or their affiliated venues,

339
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,840
but their manager admitted
at the time they were going to have

340
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:00,759
"to play at weird places
like a ski resort in Lake Tahoe

341
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,840
and a fairground in San Diego."

342
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:06,440
And if Pearl Jam in the '90s
doesn't have the power

343
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:09,440
to walk away from Ticketmaster,
nobody does.

344
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:13,400
So, when you wonder "why can't
my favorite artist, or magician,

345
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,200
just use another ticketing company?"

346
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,079
The truth is,
if they want to perform

347
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,759
at a venue that has an exclusive
contract with Ticketmaster,

348
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,720
they actually can't do that.

349
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,920
But fees are obviously
not the only complaint

350
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,400
that people have
with the ticket buying process.

351
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,759
Another is tickets disappearing
before you have a chance to buy them.

352
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:34,640
Concerts for major artists
can sell out so fast,

353
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,440
sometimes, they even make the news.

354
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:39,359
You know you're hot when you can
sell out Madison Square Garden

355
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,960
20,000 seats, 30 seconds.
That's what Justin Bieber did!

356
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,799
We're talking about two shows,
at the Garden,

357
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,799
which seats
around 20,000 people,

358
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,400
selling out in less time
than it takes me to apply my lip gloss.

359
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
That's crazy!

360
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,799
Yeah, that is crazy. Not just Bieber
selling out 20,000 seats in 30 seconds,

361
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,240
though, but also that she puts
lip gloss on for over 30 seconds!

362
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:03,759
That is just way too much time.
I'll show you how you do it!

363
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:06,680
Put a timer on the screen right now.
Check this shit out!

364
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,839
Stop the clock. Look at that!

365
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:15,519
Not even close to 30 seconds,
I didn't break a sweat,

366
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:17,960
and I look fucking great.

367
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,640
And here's the thing: selling 20,000
seats in 30 seconds would be crazy,

368
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,640
if that's what Bieber did,
but he didn't.

369
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,640
Because a report from
the New York AG later revealed

370
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,240
fewer than 2,000 tickets
were actually put on sale that day.

371
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,119
And that's by no means a one-off.

372
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,279
For many top shows,
less than 25% of tickets

373
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:39,960
are initially released
to the general public.

374
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:42,480
And in an audit
of The Blaisdell Center in Honolulu,

375
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,519
they found that, when Janet Jackson
played there in 2015,

376
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,039
only 8 percent of all tickets
went to the general public,

377
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,720
and when Mariah Carey played
there the next year, it was 7 percent.

378
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:55,799
That was presumably
for her famed Mariah

379
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,319
"Good Fucking Luck
Getting In To See This" Tour.

380
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:02,160
And if you're wondering where on earth
the rest of the tickets go,

381
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,920
well, they are deliberately held back
to be sold in other ways.

382
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,359
And often a big chunk
goes to credit card companies,

383
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,240
as you might know
from ads like this.

384
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:12,359
When Lauren broke up with me,
she said...

385
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,680
Chuck, you're a little boring.

386
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,559
Boring.

387
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,160
Boring.

388
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:26,480
Use any Citi card to get
the benefits of Private Pass.

389
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,279
More concerts, more events,
more experiences.

390
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,319
"Yeah, Lauren?
Would a 'boring' guy

391
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,759
use our break-up as an excuse
to sign up for a credit card

392
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:37,480
so that I could quietly stand backstage
during an Alicia Keys concert,

393
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,319
an on-paper sensible decision?

394
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,799
I submit that a boring guy
would not do that, Lauren,

395
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,519
and I await your confirmation.

396
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,519
You fucked up, Lauren.
You fucked up."

397
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,279
And it's not just tickets being
siloed away for credit card offers.

398
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,799
They can also wind up
being put on sale by the promoter,

399
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,559
or a radio station,
or through an artist's fan club.

400
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,720
Which sounds fine!

401
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:00,920
But a lot of average fans
can't afford special credit cards

402
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,720
or don't have time
to jump through hoops in a fan club.

403
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:06,920
But one group very much has that time,
and the resources,

404
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,200
and that is professional
ticket brokers.

405
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,599
These are the individuals or companies
that buy up tons of tickets

406
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,000
before you can get them,

407
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,599
sometimes with the help of bots
that snap them up incredibly quickly,

408
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,759
because, as you I'm sure assumed,

409
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,279
all of those stupid
"are you a robot?" tests

410
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:24,920
have very much
not kept them all out.

411
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:27,720
Because every time ticket sites
come up with a new technology,

412
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,160
bots find a way around it.

413
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,240
And once brokers
have those tickets,

414
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:34,599
they will flip them on the secondary
market at a huge markup.

415
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,359
And at this point, we should probably
talk about the secondary market.

416
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,039
It's sites like SeatGeek, StubHub

417
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:42,680
and, surprise, surprise,
Ticketmaster again.

418
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:46,839
These sites badly want you to think
of them as fan-to-fan marketplaces.

419
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,880
Ticketmaster even describes
its resale marketplace like this.

420
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,799
Our objective
is if that secondary market exists,

421
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,079
we want to create
a safe environment and platform

422
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,039
for you to be able
to exchange those tickets.

423
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:00,559
You've bought tickets
to go see someone you love.

424
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,720
At the 11th hour
your babysitter can't make it,

425
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:07,799
you should have the right
to recoup your costs on that ticket.

426
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:12,000
Right. Because the last thing that you
want is resentment towards your baby

427
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,680
to start festering
because of a missed concert.

428
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:17,079
Every time you look at their
chubby cheeks, you'll just think,

429
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,359
"If you weren't born, I'd have seen
the Red Hot Chili Peppers live

430
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,720
and I'd have been happier.
You're the worst."

431
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:28,559
But the truth is, resale sites
are not just fan to fan at all.

432
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,799
In fact,
a government report found that

433
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,759
"professional brokers
represent either the majority

434
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:36,400
or the overwhelming majority
of ticket sales" on these sites.

435
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,480
And they make
a lot of money doing it.

436
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,680
The New York AG's office found
brokers mark up the price of tickets

437
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,079
by an estimated
49 percent on average,

438
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,599
"but sometimes by more
than 1000 percent"

439
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,400
and in one case,
by 7000 percent.

440
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,680
That was for a One Direction concert,
by the way.

441
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:55,680
And let me just say, I don't
actually regret it. It was worth it.

442
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:59,519
My favorite One Direction is Niall.
I don't know who the other ones are.

443
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:01,640
And I get mad
when they sing over the top of him.

444
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:06,640
Ticket-selling sites go out of their
way to cater to their broker clients,

445
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,960
because they bring them
in a lot of money.

446
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,240
For instance,
while they limit the number of tickets

447
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:13,000
that any one account
can buy to an event,

448
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:15,519
there is an obvious way
for brokers to get around that,

449
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:18,160
and that's simply
to have more than one account.

450
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:21,759
This is a practice Ticketmaster
has long been aware of.

451
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,119
There is a ticket broker conference
in Vegas each year.

452
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,839
Just watch what happened
when reporters went undercover there,

453
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,559
and talked to someone
at Ticketmaster's booth.

454
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:33,160
Ticketmaster was busy,
surrounded by scalpers.

455
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,759
I want to know the straight goods
on whether Ticketmaster

456
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:39,039
is going to be policing us
using our multiple accounts.

457
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,119
No.

458
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,720
I have a gentleman who's got
over 200 Ticketmaster.com accounts.

459
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:47,799
How many brokers
are using multiple accounts?

460
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,960
I'd say pretty
damn near every one of them.

461
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:55,119
Yeah, of course they were!
Because you weren't stopping them.

462
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,240
Although I will say,
I'm in absolute awe

463
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:59,480
of anyone who can remember
usernames and passwords

464
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:01,480
for over 200 accounts.

465
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,559
I just use one password
for all my accounts,

466
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,519
- and it's "Niall-Horan-is-the-best
- 1- Direction-exclamation-mark."

467
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,000
Don't tell anyone
about my perfect password.

468
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,200
I have to tell you Ticketmaster insists
that it spends millions on technology

469
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:15,599
to weed out bad behavior,

470
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,440
and that that employee's comments
were not reflective of its policies.

471
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:22,279
But even taking them at their word,
which I am not inclined to do,

472
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,960
their whole system
is designed to be opaque.

473
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,279
Especially when it comes
to brokers selling tickets,

474
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:31,200
because all the resale sites,
including Ticketmaster,

475
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:34,240
actively choose to provide
anonymity to them.

476
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:36,279
So, when you buy a ticket
on the secondary market,

477
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:39,079
there is no way to know the identity
of who you're buying from,

478
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,960
whether it is a fan
whose babysitter just canceled,

479
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:46,920
or a broker who might have 500 other
tickets on sale for that same event.

480
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,440
Which, when you think about it,
is a bit weird.

481
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,720
On sites where people resell things,
you can see who you are buying from.

482
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,400
Take eBay, for instance.
If you saw this listing,

483
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,359
for a Mickey Mouse-shaped potato,
available for $50,

484
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,359
you could look at the seller,
see their username,

485
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,000
know that they have
a 100% favorable rating,

486
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,839
and feel confident
in your purchase.

487
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,119
You're thinking, "John,
you bought that potato, didn't you?

488
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,720
And it's under your desk
right now?"

489
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:15,880
No. It is not under my desk.
It's over here! Behold!

490
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,400
Yes! Of course we bought it!

491
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,079
As you can see, it definitely kind
of looks a bit like Mickey Mouse!

492
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,599
Brokers with identities concealed

493
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,359
can snap up large numbers of tickets,
and resell them at a massive markup.

494
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,799
Meanwhile, the secondary market sites
are themselves making money

495
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,359
by charging a percentage
on those ludicrous ticket prices.

496
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,839
We found a ticket for Adele
selling on SeatGeek

497
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:52,000
for $1,690, plus $538 in fees.

498
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,160
And look, here is where we need
to deal with an uncomfortable fact.

499
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,440
Which is the question
of what that ticket is actually worth.

500
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:01,799
Because an economist will tell you,
it is worth whatever people will pay.

501
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,480
So, if someone is willing to spend
over $2,000, including fees,

502
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:06,759
for an Adele ticket,

503
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,799
that is what it's worth,
as gross as that sounds.

504
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:12,400
But if Adele
doesn't want to charge that,

505
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,119
there is going to be a gap
between the face value of the ticket,

506
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,160
and what someone can get for it,

507
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,640
and a whole industry is going
to scramble in to exploit it.

508
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,720
And unfortunately, live events
are uniquely vulnerable to this,

509
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:25,200
because they are inherently rare.

510
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,240
Bad Bunny, for instance,

511
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:30,279
is probably only coming
to your town once a year at most,

512
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:33,279
and a lot more people want
to see him than there are seats.

513
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,720
And while Bad Bunny
could charge the going rate

514
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,400
for every ticket that he sells,

515
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,880
he probably doesn't want to do that,
because he'd look like an asshole.

516
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,720
Which he very much isn't. He is not
a bad bunny at all, despite the name.

517
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:46,200
If he's anything,
he's a very good bunny.

518
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:49,920
And as long as artists,
with all good intentions,

519
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,920
price their tickets below the market,
exploitation is going to happen,

520
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,839
and that woman's husband
is going to have to show feet.

521
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,880
Although it is worth noting,
some artists

522
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,240
have tried to sneakily
get the scalper price for their tickets

523
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:05,039
without anyone really noticing.

524
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,400
Remember how Justin Bieber

525
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,319
was supposedly selling out venues
in seconds,

526
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,000
while tons of tickets
were held back?

527
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:12,119
At another stop
on that same tour,

528
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,680
reporters looked into some
of the tickets on resale sites,

529
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:16,240
and found something surprising.

530
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:22,799
Section 205, row G, 14 tickets
listed for $246 each, and get this:

531
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,799
ticketing documents showed that
entire G row went to Bieber's own tour.

532
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,759
I think there is no question
when one looks at the document

533
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,119
that Bieber
is scalping his own tickets.

534
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,880
Yeah, it's true. A group
of tickets held for Bieber's tour

535
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,440
ended up being released
not to the box office,

536
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:40,559
but straight
to the secondary market.

537
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,599
And on one hand,
I do get the impulse of,

538
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,680
"if someone is going
to make $246 off that ticket,

539
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,880
shouldn't it be the person
who is doing the performing?"

540
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:50,440
But it still doesn't feel great,
does it?

541
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:52,640
And it's also not going to stop me
from showing you

542
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,440
that clip of him falling
down a hole again.

543
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,640
Excellent. I mean,
it gets better every time you see it.

544
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:05,279
And look,
Bieber's not unique in doing this.

545
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:07,839
A few years back, it emerged
that Live Nation had helped Metallica

546
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,119
place tickets
directly onto the resale market,

547
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,279
admitting "about a dozen
other artists"

548
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:14,440
had asked them to do this
in recent years.

549
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:17,480
And before you worry,
no, I am not one of the artists

550
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:20,640
putting tickets to this show
straight onto the resale market.

551
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,240
We do it the right way,
distributing tickets at random

552
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:26,039
to anyone who happens to be
walking past the studio at the time.

553
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:29,039
Half of these idiots think I'm the warm
up act for Drew Barrymore.

554
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:32,000
She'll be out any minute, folks.
She'll be out any minute.

555
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:34,400
She's so glad you're here.
Okay, all right?

556
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:38,400
So, when you take
all of this together,

557
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,279
the reason tickets are so hard
to get when they're on sale

558
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,240
is that they're often not on sale.

559
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:45,319
And the reason they cost so much
on the secondary market

560
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,440
is that you're paying exorbitant
fees to the platform,

561
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:49,400
and might be buying from a broker,

562
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,240
or in rare cases,
even from the artist themselves.

563
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:55,160
And this whole ecosystem
enriches a lot of people

564
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,240
who do not contribute anything to the
actual show that you are paying to see.

565
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:03,359
And at the center of all this
is Ticketmaster because it turbocharged

566
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,319
many of the shitty practices that
have now become industry standard.

567
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,240
So, what can we do?

568
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:12,680
Congress could inject transparency
into this process

569
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:16,160
by passing laws that require sites
to disclose their fees up front,

570
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,039
along with the identity
of the seller on resale sites.

571
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:23,440
The truth is, much of the power here
is actually in the hands of the artists.

572
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:27,400
The biggest ones could do things
to tamp down the secondary market

573
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,920
like making their tickets
non-transferable,

574
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,720
meaning resale is restricted.

575
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:34,359
Bands like Pearl Jam
have experimented with this,

576
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,400
and before their 2020 tour
was postponed,

577
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,400
they even worked with Ticketmaster
to create an online marketplace

578
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,920
where fans could sell tickets
that they didn't need,

579
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,680
but with no additional fees
and not for a profit.

580
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,240
That seems like the model
that everyone should be using here.

581
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:52,480
But if regulators don't act,
and artists don't have the clout

582
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,319
or the inclination to require companies
to put those guardrails in place,

583
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,440
I'm afraid you as a fan
are going to remain vulnerable

584
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:01,400
to the worst parts of this system.

585
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,400
One driven by one of the most
widely loathed companies on the planet

586
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,599
that became even bigger
due to a merger

587
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,880
that probably shouldn't
even have been allowed.

588
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,920
And I know that all of this
may feel a little unsatisfying.

589
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,839
But if it's any consolation to you,
I personally promise

590
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,559
to continue to offer the only accurately
priced entertainment on the market.

591
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,519
You know what I'm talking about.

592
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm talking about one in which tickets
for this show remain available for free,

593
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:29,200
and you can come watch
a decaying man shout numbers,

594
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,960
apply lip gloss shoddily, and
shamelessly earn back your good will

595
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,960
by showing you a potato
that, you have to admit it,

596
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:38,839
does look a bit
like a famous mouse.

597
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,839
That is our show.
Thank you so much for watching.

598
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,480
We're off next week.
We'll be back the week after that.

599
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,559
Good night!
