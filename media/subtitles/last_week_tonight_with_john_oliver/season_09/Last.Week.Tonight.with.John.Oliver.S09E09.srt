00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,559
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,640
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight",
I'm John Oliver.

3
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,000
Thank you so much for joining us.
It's been another busy week.

4
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,520
The Russian invasion of Ukraine
entered its third month,

5
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,479
Elon Musk continued
to Musk everything up,

6
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,799
and Madison Cawthorn,
Congress's freshest-faced idiot,

7
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,399
brought a loaded handgun
to an airport. Again.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,679
But instead of that, we're going
to focus on this year's elections.

9
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:55,280
A lot of governors and local officials
are on the ballot this year,

10
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,840
and some have been trying
to make a splash with big stunts,

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,000
like Ron DeSantis,
governor of Florida

12
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,880
and a man who has what I can only
describe as "Green Book" vibes.

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,920
Now, we've talked before
about his Don't Say Gay bill,

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,760
and Disney's belated
condemnation of it.

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,920
Last week,
DeSantis took a bold step to retaliate.

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,319
As promised, Florida Republican
governor Ron DeSantis

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,680
signing a law ending Disney's
self-government and tax breaks.

18
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,840
The self-government at Disney is called
the Reedy Creek Improvement District.

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,280
It provides fire, EMS,
electricity, and other functions,

20
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,359
like any other government would.

21
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:33,400
It's true. In the part of central
Florida where Disney World is,

22
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,879
the company technically functions
as a self-contained government,

23
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,560
providing essential services,
except, crucially, a morgue.

24
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,120
Why? Because no one, look at me,
no one has ever died at Disney.

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,840
And no one will ever die at Disney.
Do you hear me?

26
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,920
There is no fucking morgue at Disney.
Nod if you understand me.

27
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,760
Very good.

28
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,079
There are plenty of signs that DeSantis
didn't really think this through,

29
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,200
with experts pointing out
that the law may actually

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,840
"violate the contract clause
of the Florida Constitution",

31
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,400
and also that Florida state law
requires the county

32
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,280
assumes the district's debt
when it's dissolved.

33
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,639
Which could mean
that Orange and Osceola counties,

34
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:15,960
where the district is, inherit upward
of a billion dollars in bond debt.

35
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,800
It is no wonder that there are concerns
about all the potential disruption here.

36
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:22,960
Thankfully, DeSantis
had some reassuring words.

37
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,759
We're gonna take care of all that.
Don't worry.

38
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,560
This is all,
we have everything all thought out.

39
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,759
Don't let anyone tell you

40
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,360
that somehow Disney
is gonna get a tax cut out of this.

41
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,400
They're going to pay more taxes
as a result of this.

42
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,599
Okay, there is just nothing more
immediately off-putting

43
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,199
than someone starting a sentence
with "don't worry".

44
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,879
He sounds like a frat boy

45
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,280
trying to reason with the cops
after a noise complaint.

46
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
"Don't worry, man,
we're gonna take care of all of that.

47
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,520
We've got everything thought out.
You guys want a beer or something?

48
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,879
You want to hang out?"

49
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,520
And follow-up statements
from DeSantis's office

50
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,439
continued to be vague on details,

51
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,680
with one spokeswoman
admitting "the governor's office

52
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,479
does not have a written plan
on how the dissolution will proceed."

53
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,120
Which, of course it doesn't.

54
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:05,639
And look, do I think it's bad
if Disney pays more taxes?

55
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,879
No, I don't!
That would be a good thing.

56
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,080
I don't love that it might happen
not through meaningful tax reform,

57
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,479
but on the whim
of one right-wing dipshit

58
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,039
who's scared of gay people and doesn't
understand the First Amendment,

59
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,599
but hey, ends, means,
what are you gonna do?

60
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,360
The thing is, it's not just DeSantis
engaging in harmful stunts.

61
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:25,199
In Texas, Greg Abbott has been
doing exactly the same.

62
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,439
You may remember
a few weeks ago, he announced

63
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,919
that he'd be sending charter buses
of migrants to Washington, D.C.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,199
But he also recently
decided to subject

65
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,039
every commercial truck crossing
the border to strict inspections,

66
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,960
causing absolute chaos.

67
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,759
These trucks are already

68
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,479
inspected by U.S. Customs and
the U.S. Department of Transportation,

69
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,479
but now, per Governor Abbott, DPS
is also conducting safety inspections

70
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,719
with the stated goal of stopping
cases of human smuggling.

71
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:54,199
Normally, it takes these trucks
that you see behind me

72
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,960
about 30, 40 minutes to cross,

73
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:58,159
but earlier today
we heard of one truck driver

74
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,680
that sat in line for 12 hours trying
to bring product into the US.

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,639
There is no greater hell

76
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:09,400
than being pointlessly stuck in traffic
for 12 hours because of Greg Abbott,

77
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,560
except that there is, being stuck in
traffic for 12 hours with Greg Abbott.

78
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,279
That is a road trip movie
that no one wants to see.

79
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,519
Abbott called the scheme off
after just eight days,

80
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,480
which is a good thing, especially
given that, by some estimates,

81
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,680
Texas lost $4 billion
from the disruptions,

82
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,879
while finding no migrants,
and "zero drugs,

83
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:32,399
weapons, or any other
type of contraband".

84
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,600
Apparently, all Abbott's inspections
did manage to find

85
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,360
were things like oil leaks
and flat tires.

86
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:40,680
Meaning that he caused
a hellish traffic jam

87
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,360
only to do the work of the world's
most expensive Jiffy Lube.

88
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,560
And then there was L.A. County
sheriff Alex Villanueva,

89
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,240
seen here looking
like a potato cowboy.

90
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,759
His re-election bid this year has been
overshadowed by claims in L.A. Times

91
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,879
that he directed
a cover up of an incident

92
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,560
where one of his deputies knelt
on a detainee's head for three minutes.

93
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,399
It is a damning story about abuse
of power and lack of transparency,

94
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,680
and Villaneuva took swift action
against those responsible

95
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,279
for everyone finding out about it.

96
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,040
The sheriff says there's now
a criminal investigation

97
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,000
into who released
the video to the L.A. Times.

98
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,600
So here are the three individuals
that we want to know a lot about.

99
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,720
He pointed out his political opponent
in the race for sheriff,

100
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,959
the inspector general,
and an L.A. Times reporter.

101
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,759
The matter is under investigation.
This is stolen property

102
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,680
that was removed illegally
from people who had some intent,

103
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,680
criminal intent,
and it'll be subject to investigation.

104
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,360
When you're accused of being
complicit in a terrible act,

105
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,639
being more concerned about
who said it than the accusation

106
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,920
doesn't exactly convey innocence.

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,920
If someone said, "John Oliver likes
to be called 'Big Daddy Zazu

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,120
with the Long, Long Beak'
around the office",

109
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,759
and my response was,
"Who said that? Was it Joseph?

110
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,680
I'm going to investigate Joseph".

111
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,800
That would be more than
a little suspicious, wouldn't it?

112
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,920
Besides, that would never happen,
because, of course,

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,959
Big Daddy Zazu runs a tight ship.

114
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:10,519
Now, legally, I have to tell you,
Villanueva denies any wrongdoing

115
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,560
and says that he only learned
of the kneeling incident

116
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,360
"eight months after it occurred and
immediately launched an investigation,"

117
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,439
although a former top official in
his department has now filed a claim,

118
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:23,279
saying that she watched the video
with him and two others

119
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,040
just five days
after the incident happened.

120
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,519
And sweeping things under the carpet
seems to be Villanueva's style.

121
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,160
Because despite campaigning
four years ago

122
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,040
as a reformer in an infamously
corrupt department,

123
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,879
his record
since then has not been great.

124
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,240
A 2019 IG report found that,
over just a two-month period,

125
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,079
officials working under him canceled
"45 administrative investigations"

126
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,360
into his employees,

127
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:51,439
some of which involved
domestic violence, child abuse,

128
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,560
and sexual misconduct
with an inmate.

129
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,199
And he's not just breaking
promises to reform,

130
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:00,519
it seems his re-election bid is going
to involve going full culture-war.

131
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,959
I think 2022
is going to be a special year.

132
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,639
I think it's going to be a referendum
on a national disease,

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,199
is going to finally
see a cure coming along.

134
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,920
Wokeism is on the ropes.
Let's put it out of its misery.

135
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,360
That's fun, isn't it?

136
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,959
You probably thought that the national
disease he was referring to there

137
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,480
was the literal one that's killed almost
a million Americans in two years.

138
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,000
Or the figurative one that is BTS fever.

139
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,199
And by the way, Yoongi, marry me.
I have the documents.

140
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,319
But instead, he meant the bullshit
disease that means you're not allowed

141
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,879
to make fun of your nephew
for being a sociology major.

142
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,639
You know, the real tragedy.

143
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:44,560
But perhaps Villanueva's piece
de résistance is a new campaign ad

144
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,360
which honestly may be one of the
dumbest things that I've ever seen.

145
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,800
I'm going to show you
all 30 seconds of it, mainly because

146
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,199
I cannot think of a single part of it
that you don't need to see.

147
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,279
I fear for my home's future.

148
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,519
The California dream
has turned to a nightmare.

149
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,879
The politicians have let us down.

150
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:16,120
Let's stand up to the corruption.
Let's fight for ourselves.

151
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,160
Let's bring the dream back.

152
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,279
I'm Alex Villanueva,
and I approve this message.

153
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,639
Now, obviously, that is all idiotic,

154
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,360
from the 1990s rollerblader,

155
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,240
to the song choice for your "California
dream" ad being "Ave Maria"

156
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,720
and not, I dunno,
"California Dreamin'"

157
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,879
to the fact that everyone there
is having an absolute ball,

158
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,799
including the people
experiencing a break-in.

159
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,159
I've honestly never seen anyone
this happy while getting robbed,

160
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,879
and I saw Glenn Close
at the Oscars eight times.

161
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,360
But perhaps the weirdest decision
comes at the end,

162
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,159
when an inexplicably wet Villanueva
works a look that can best be described

163
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,840
as "high school coach
minutes before being busted

164
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,639
for spying
on the girls' locker room",

165
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,840
and announces,

166
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:04,480
"Let's stand up to the corruption,
let's fight for ourselves,"

167
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,080
which, given that he's the one who's
been in charge the last four years,

168
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,639
seems like a pretty good slogan
for anyone running against him.

169
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,799
But the thing is it seems that
he's going to get re-elected this year.

170
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:18,519
Bullying a reporter
might actually help him,

171
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,559
just like DeSantis and Abbott's
harmful stunts are likely to help them.

172
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,039
Because the name of the game
in politics these days

173
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,639
seems to be less "can you help
the most people?" and more,

174
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,399
"how much can you hurt the people
your supporters hate the most?"

175
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,840
Even if all voters get in return
is a massive logistical headache,

176
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:38,519
a 12-hour traffic jam,

177
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,240
and the most unwatchable depiction of
Southern California since "La La Land".

178
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,799
It's just not great.

179
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
And now, this!

180
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,519
And now...

181
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,799
Shaquille O'Neal Can't Stop Explaining
How to Save Money on Gas.

182
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,120
I didn't want to get a certain vehicle

183
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,679
because of the amount of gas
I would have to spend.

184
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,399
It costs like $80 to fill it up.
And he said, then you said...

185
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,320
When it gets to half, then you put $20,
you bring it back to full.

186
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,879
You're complaining about when it
gets to zero, you spend it 80, right?

187
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,559
When it gets to half, you put 20. Then
when it gets back to half, you put 20.

188
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:15,519
I'll keep stopping, putting 20 in, and
it'll be, 80, the same amount of gas!

189
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,000
- I already paid the 80, right?
- Yep.

190
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,960
- And when I get to half...
- Now you're out of gas.

191
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:22,399
No. When I get to half,
that's Valdosta, right?

192
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,480
Now I'm gonna have 20.

193
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,039
But if you let it get
to half by Wednesday,

194
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,480
then you pay 20,
that gets it back up to full.

195
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:30,600
No! It won't get to half by,
but if Wednesday it's going to be 40.

196
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,639
- Then on Friday it'll be 40 again.
- Not 40, 20.

197
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,519
If I'm at half,
I don't want to keep driving.

198
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,320
- But where are you driving to?
- Shut it up!

199
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,799
Half of 80 is 40.

200
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,399
- But no, listen to what I'm saying.
- I did.

201
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,279
When we get to half, spend 20 and fill
it back up, booboo. That's my point.

202
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,960
When I get to half, I'm gonna put 20,
that's going to bring a little full,

203
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,559
if I'm at half and I keep driving,
I'm going to go down.

204
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:53,320
- But if I'm at half and I get 20...
- Where you're driving matters!

205
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,799
- I never drive my car again ever?
- You're complaining about the $80.

206
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:00,759
- Yes. I'm complaining.
- Right, so, at zero is 80.

207
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,240
We've heard it so many times.

208
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,000
Shaq, how much gas do you think
you can get for $20 right now?

209
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,679
Don't start
about half full and filling!

210
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:10,919
If I add 20,

211
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,600
it's going to give me some cushion
so I can go home and come back.

212
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:16,639
And you'll be back here tomorrow.
Case closed. Shut the hell up!

213
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,799
- Case closed indeed.
- Yes.

214
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,279
- Yeah, please.
- Trust me. My gas method works.

215
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,159
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns pollution.

216
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,279
It's the thing that PSAs
have been warning us about

217
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,879
for more than half a century.

218
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,159
Before you take another breath,

219
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,720
think what air pollution
may be doing to your lungs.

220
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:39,720
Hold it now! Think, what
are you going to do about it?

221
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,840
If there are groups in your town
fighting to make the air clean,

222
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,519
join them or write to Clean Air
Washington, D.C.

223
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,440
By the way,
holding your breath is not the answer.

224
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,440
CLEAN AIR

225
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,120
Flawless. Not a single flaw.
The only thing I'd say there is,

226
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,240
you could have had a little more fun
with what's written on the balls.

227
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:15,559
You're already the flirtiest weirdo
1960s PSAs had to offer. Swing big!

228
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:18,279
You could have gone with, "Bet you
didn't know these were in my mouth",

229
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,480
or, "These are Kermit's eyes",

230
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,080
or, "Robert Kennedy
will be shot on June 5th, 1968!"

231
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,960
The world was your oyster there!

232
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,200
We all suffer from exposure
to pollution in this country,

233
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,559
but some significantly
more than others,

234
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:34,159
thanks to what's called
environmental racism.

235
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,879
Black Americans are exposed
to 38 percent more polluted air

236
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,120
and are "75 percent more likely

237
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,279
to live in communities
that border a plant or a factory".

238
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,399
And crucially,

239
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,320
the disparity in exposure persists
even when controlling for income.

240
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,840
One study found that on average,
Black Americans making $200,000

241
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:56,279
were exposed to more air pollution
than white Americans making 25,000.

242
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,720
Proving that yet again,

243
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:01,480
racism is one of the few things in this
country more powerful than money.

244
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:04,559
In fact, I believe America's
current top five power rankings go:

245
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,600
racism, beef, viral videos of soldiers
reuniting with their dogs,

246
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:11,600
DJ Khaled's PR team,
and then money.

247
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,720
And while the decisions that lead
to disparate outcomes can be subtle,

248
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:18,600
they can also be incredibly flagrant.

249
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:22,639
In 2008, there was a massive spill
of coal ash here, in Tennessee,

250
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,039
with tons of toxic waste dumped
into a largely white community.

251
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,799
Now, the good news is,
they removed four million tons of it.

252
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:33,279
The bad news is,
it was then dumped 300 miles away,

253
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,200
in this largely Black
community called Uniontown,

254
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:39,240
where residents were pretty
clear about what had just happened.

255
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,600
Taking that from a white area,
the white people didn't want it,

256
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:43,960
let's just keep it 100.

257
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:46,720
Why do you think
it's good enough for the Blacks?

258
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,840
Yeah, she's absolutely right.

259
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,360
It seems when white people
don't want something anymore,

260
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,639
they either dump it
on minority communities,

261
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,279
or sew a hummingbird on it, and list
it on Etsy as handmade vintage.

262
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,240
Let's keep it 100 for a second,
that is garbage.

263
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:04,120
The fact is, though,
Black neighborhoods in particular

264
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,519
can get targeted
with incredible precision,

265
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,639
and the stakes
could not be higher here.

266
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,120
Pollution is one of the driving factors
behind conditions like heart disease,

267
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,039
asthma, and even death,
with Black Americans

268
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,279
nearly three times as likely to die
from exposure to pollution.

269
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:23,000
And vast disparities can even exist
even within the same city,

270
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,639
as this environmental
expert breaks down.

271
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,000
The ZIP Code is the most important
predictor of health and well-being.

272
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,879
You tell me your ZIP Code,
I can tell you how healthy you are.

273
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,720
All ZIP Codes
are not created equal.

274
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,000
- Really?
- Yes.

275
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,679
You can find ZIP Codes
that are adjacent to each other

276
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,919
and have a life expectancy
disparity of 10, 15 years

277
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,039
depending on what's in the neighborhood
and what's not in the neighborhood.

278
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That is grim.

279
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,519
"You can live 15 fewer years
depending on your ZIP Code"

280
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,559
is the worst ZIP Code news

281
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,879
since the time that they added
those four bullshit digits at the end.

282
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,840
I don't know what those are,
and I am never gonna learn them.

283
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:01,759
I know my five-digit ZIP Code,
my Social Security number,

284
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,120
my birthday,
one of my children's birthdays,

285
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,519
and that is the end of my numbers.
I'm not learning any more.

286
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,000
Given just how awful its effects are,
let's look at environmental racism.

287
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,480
How it got this bad,

288
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:17,559
how government and industry
continue to fail people of color,

289
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,240
and what we can do about it.

290
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,320
And the first major factor
to consider here is history.

291
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,759
As we've discussed
before on this comedy show,

292
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,600
it was explicit federal policy
for decades to segregate housing

293
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:31,759
based on race through a process
known as redlining.

294
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,759
Basically, Black people could not get
government-backed home loans

295
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,279
where white people lived.

296
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,000
The areas where they could live were
often also zoned for industrial uses.

297
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,519
Here's how it worked in Dallas.

298
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,759
So, you can take a redlining map
from the '30s and the maps from '40s

299
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,840
and overlay that on a current
industrial map of Dallas.

300
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,000
And they'll show you Black and Brown
folks are forced to live

301
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,840
side by side by heavy industry

302
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:59,360
in a way that nobody else in Dallas
is forced to live.

303
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,759
That's basically
the same parts of town!

304
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,799
Which does seem pretty intentional!

305
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:07,279
I know some things
are just weird coincidences,

306
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,600
like how John Adams and
Thomas Jefferson died on the same day,

307
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,759
or how George Washington
had wooden teeth

308
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,080
and Patrick Henry
died of anal splinters.

309
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:19,159
Just a random, true fact that they
don't teach you about in history class.

310
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,879
But this, this is no coincidence!

311
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,159
And that might at least partly explain
why the life expectancy here, in Joppa,

312
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,799
a predominantly Black area
with a lot of industrial zoning,

313
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:35,320
is just 71, while in the predominantly
white Highland Park, it is 84.

314
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:36,919
And it definitely helps explain

315
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,200
why certain neighborhoods have to
put up with shit like shingle mountain.

316
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:42,960
That is the work of a company
named Blue Star Recycling,

317
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:46,720
which claimed that it had a plan to
recycle roofing shingles into asphalt.

318
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:50,960
So, it started dumping a literal
mountain of them into a lot,

319
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:54,600
right next to homes in a largely
Black and Latino neighborhood.

320
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,080
Look at it, shingle mountain.

321
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:02,360
That's 100,000 tons of shingles.

322
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:05,839
- 100,000 tons of shingles?
- Yes. Exactly.

323
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:07,920
It kind of smells like...

324
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,799
just rubber,
like raw rubber.

325
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,480
It does,
it smells like burnt pavement.

326
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,759
- Excuse me.
- Bless you.

327
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:18,519
Bless you.

328
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,079
- I think I'm feeling all this dust.
- I better get you out and back here.

329
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,480
- This is what we're going through.
- You can feel it going up your nose.

330
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,799
Yeah. You can actually
feel it on the mouth.

331
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
- Excuse me.
- Bless you.

332
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,519
Sneezing in response
to 100,000 tons of fiberglass waste

333
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:35,039
is fine a couple of times,
but there is a point

334
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:38,000
when you're just interrupting people,
and it is rude.

335
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,880
You cannot deny, it is impressive
that it took all of five seconds

336
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
for that mountain
to turn Soledad O'Brien

337
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,079
into a woman at the beginning
of an allergy commercial,

338
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,799
when she's still in black and white.

339
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:51,160
And Blue Star's owner,
Chris Ganter,

340
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,200
did not seem that concerned
about the mess that he made.

341
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:55,400
Watch what happened

342
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,559
when O'Brien managed to stop sneezing
for long enough to call him.

343
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,519
Let me ask you a question.

344
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:03,839
When you think of the people
who live there on shingle mountain.

345
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,160
What would you say to them?
It's pretty gross. It smells...

346
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,079
The whole neighborhood
around there's gross.

347
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,960
Everything around there
is an industrial area.

348
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:13,400
I didn't really go down
there very often

349
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,319
'cause I didn't like being down
in that part of town.

350
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,599
But do you think the people there,
do you feel sorry for them?

351
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,759
Do you feel like, listen, that's where
they live, they get what they get?

352
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,160
Everybody knew what the zoning of the
area was when they, when they bought.

353
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,720
It's kind of like, I don't know,
buying right next to the nuclear place

354
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,319
and then complaining later about it.
It's an industrial area.

355
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,920
And every city has to have
an industrial area. Just the way it is.

356
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:39,039
Part of me almost appreciates
that level of unapologetic shittiness.

357
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,000
No efforts to spin or dodge it,
just flat-out saying,

358
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,359
"It's an icky part of town full of gross
poors who deserve to live in filth.

359
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,000
Did you get
all of that for your news report?

360
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:49,079
I can say it again slower
if it helps."

361
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,880
But what Ganter clearly
does not understand there

362
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,720
is that a lot of people didn't choose
to live in an industrial area.

363
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:59,000
Racist zoning policies
chose for them.

364
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,480
And while his company
eventually went belly-up,

365
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,880
and local activists got the city
to move the shingles,

366
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,079
it only moved them
just across the highway

367
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,640
to a massive landfill allowed
by the neighborhood's zoning.

368
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,400
But history and zoning
are only part of the story here.

369
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,519
'Cause it also is about
who has the power to push back.

370
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:20,000
And polluters often assume that Black
communities, in particular,

371
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,680
won't be able to stop them.

372
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:23,279
Take the Byhalia Pipeline.

373
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:25,920
It was a joint venture
between these two companies,

374
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,559
who planned for their oil pipeline

375
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,400
to take a very deliberate path
through Memphis.

376
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,400
The path Byhalia proposed winds
down through south Memphis,

377
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,920
cutting through several
historically Black communities.

378
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,079
There is a more direct option,

379
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,279
but that would cut
through predominantly white,

380
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:42,920
wealthier neighborhoods
in the north.

381
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:45,680
Yeah, that does seem
a little odd, doesn't it?

382
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:49,000
Normally, the shortest distance
between two points is a straight line,

383
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:52,200
not through any Black people
who happen to be living nearby.

384
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,599
Although I will say,
the least surprising thing there

385
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,599
is that the white wealthy suburb
is called Germantown.

386
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That is the name you give
your community

387
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:02,960
when Aryanville
feels a little too obvious.

388
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,680
And while the companies
behind the Byhalia Pipeline

389
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,039
insist that they had good reasons
for choosing the path that they did,

390
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,799
according to a local activist,

391
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,680
a rep for them once accidentally
said the quiet part out loud.

392
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,400
There was a community meeting
that Byhalia Pipeline held,

393
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,000
and they were asked by one of
the members of the community,

394
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,920
"Why did you
all choose this route?"

395
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,319
And there's usually a PR answer,
but instead,

396
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,559
the representative
was pretty clear and plain.

397
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,759
"We basically chose
a point of least resistance".

398
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:37,640
When people aren't scripted,

399
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,759
you can really learn what they
believe and what they think.

400
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,640
You don't usually get a corporate
PR line quite so honest.

401
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,680
There is a reason that Apple's slogan
is "Think Different"

402
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,799
and not "We made all the ports
different again.

403
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,359
What are you gonna do?
Nothing. You'll do nothing.

404
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,000
You'll buy $100 of new cords
that'll last you until next year

405
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:58,880
when we invent some shit
called USB-Q or whatever.

406
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,720
It's not even
about the money for us anymore,

407
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,759
it's about the erotic rush
of power."

408
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,839
I have to tell you,
the pipeline company

409
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,519
insists that that rep's answer
did not reflect the company's views,

410
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,039
and that he should have said
that they

411
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:13,720
"look for routes with the least
collective impact to the community."

412
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:17,039
And that definitely does sound better
than the actual truth,

413
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:19,119
which is that largely
minority communities

414
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,359
often are seen
as the path of least resistance.

415
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,519
And while local activists
have tried to resist,

416
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:27,559
and for decades,
they've often done it alone,

417
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,799
as big environmental groups
haven't been the best allies.

418
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,440
As this climate justice activist
points out,

419
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:36,720
the priorities
of the environmental movement

420
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,440
have tended
to leave certain communities out.

421
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:41,880
We need to redefine environmentalism

422
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,680
to think more inclusively
than the traditional perception

423
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,440
of the environmental movement,
which tends to be on,

424
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:51,440
you know, saving the whales,
or flora and fauna.

425
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,559
I did a talk recently
in a national park

426
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,440
and when it was
being advertised,

427
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:01,599
there were people who were perplexed
and people who were actually opposed

428
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,799
to having a conversation
about environmental justice.

429
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,720
Environmentalism clearly shouldn't
just be about protecting wild spaces.

430
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:12,599
Humans do need protection, too.

431
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,279
And I know
it's not the most popular stance,

432
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:17,680
but maybe conservationists
could redirect some of the resources

433
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:19,200
to environmental justice

434
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,359
that they've been
completely wasting on pandas.

435
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,519
And I mean specifically pandas.

436
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,200
We spend so much time saving them,
and why, exactly?

437
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,319
They don't want to be here.
They don't fuck each other.

438
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,039
They spend most of their time
falling off something.

439
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,960
Seriously, you watch videos of pandas,
they're constantly falling down.

440
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,400
It's time to let them go

441
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,359
as fast as they let go
to whatever they are holding.

442
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,359
And the thing is, at least
with something like shingle mountain,

443
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,720
you can see it,
so you know to fight it.

444
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,160
But sometimes,
pollution can be invisible.

445
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,559
And those that you'd expect
to warn you about that

446
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,640
can be incredibly slow to do so when
it comes to communities of color.

447
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,440
You're probably already familiar
to what happened

448
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:02,359
to the residents of Flint, Michigan,
but that is the tip of the iceberg here.

449
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,200
Take the West Calumet Housing
Complex in East Chicago, Indiana,

450
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:10,400
a federally assisted housing community
built on top of a former lead smelter.

451
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,759
The lead levels there
were dangerously off the charts.

452
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:17,160
How far off the charts?
I'll let this reporter fill you in.

453
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,880
The safe level is supposed to be
400 parts per million.

454
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:25,359
They found levels
of 1,200 parts per million

455
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,160
which is already
an emergency level.

456
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,359
But in some areas
in the soil underneath the ground,

457
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,200
they have found areas
of 45,000 parts per million

458
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,359
and even 90,000 parts per million.

459
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,480
It's true.

460
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:42,400
They found lead more than 200 times
higher than the level requiring cleanup.

461
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,359
Which just isn't great when the place
that you found it is the ground,

462
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,599
a thing notoriously difficult
to avoid, unless, that is,

463
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,079
you're willing
to spend the rest of your life

464
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,400
playing a very high
stakes version of the floor is lava.

465
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,000
What's even worse is the government
knew the area was dangerously toxic

466
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,440
decades before they told anyone
who lived there.

467
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:06,200
Time and again, regulators
had the opportunity to tell residents,

468
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,839
and they just didn't.

469
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,920
Like in 1985, when the EPA
first found high levels of lead

470
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,640
in the soil near the housing complex.

471
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,279
They didn't notify residents.

472
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:18,599
Or later, in 1998, when the Department
of Health and Human Services

473
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,119
and state health officials

474
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,119
found 30 percent of children under six
in the housing complex

475
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,720
had elevated blood lead levels,
they didn't notify residents.

476
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,200
Flash forward to 2009, the EPA
declared the land West Calumet

477
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:34,359
was on a superfund site, marking it
a priority for contamination cleanup,

478
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,319
and still didn't notify residents.

479
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,559
And quick side note here:
they didn't have to do that,

480
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,920
because, fun fact, federal law
doesn't require its agencies

481
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,400
to tell tenants that a unit
is located on a superfund site.

482
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,440
Which I truly cannot
wrap my head around.

483
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:53,039
The whole point of superfund
is to officially classify something,

484
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:55,799
in the government record,
as very dangerous.

485
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,119
So, it is not great to do that and then
not tell the people actually at risk.

486
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,160
It's like putting a "Do Not Leave,
Lean Over the Fence" sign

487
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,559
at a bear exhibit
and having it face the bear side.

488
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,200
Sure, the information's
technically out there,

489
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,400
but it's not really doing
much to improve public safety.

490
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,119
Anyway, in 2014, the EPA,
the DOJ, the state of Indiana,

491
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,920
and the corporations responsible
for the contamination

492
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,640
agreed on a remediation plan, but still
didn't tell residents about the danger.

493
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,440
In fact, it was only in 2016, when the
EPA found those lead levels in the soil

494
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:32,160
hundreds of times their maximum
permitted level,

495
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,839
that the city finally
sent a letter to residents

496
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,559
telling them
about the contamination.

497
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,920
That is 31 years
and eight government agencies later.

498
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,480
Even then, the steps the government
took were utterly pathetic.

499
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:50,200
On Monday, the EPA will be passing
out flyers like these

500
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,640
which have lots of safety tips
including reminding families

501
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,000
not to let their children play
in the dirt, play in the grass,

502
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:00,440
and to remove their shoes
before walking into their homes.

503
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,960
I've been told to just keep
your children out of the grass

504
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,359
and out of the areas
where the mulch is.

505
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:11,559
How do you do that
when children play?

506
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:13,480
That's what they do.

507
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,440
She's right.
Kids want to run around and play.

508
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:20,279
Although in the government's defense,
they did put up that sign.

509
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:24,920
There is nothing children respect more
than the authority of a flimsy sign.

510
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,720
"Sorry, friends, no frolicking,
hijinks or tomfoolery for us today.

511
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,200
After all, the sign is watching us."

512
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:35,440
And while the details in this example
may be extraordinary,

513
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:36,640
it is worth noting

514
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,160
that "70 percent of hazardous
waste sites on the superfund list

515
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:43,920
are located within one mile
of federally assisted housing."

516
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,039
But this isn't about cleaning
pollution that already happened.

517
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,359
It's about deciding

518
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,119
where industries will be allowed
to pollute going forward.

519
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,240
And without significant changes,
our whole system is currently set up

520
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:00,039
so that places that have already been
polluted get worse and worse.

521
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,400
There's even a term for this:
"sacrifice zones",

522
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,400
areas of the country where it is both
government policy and industry practice

523
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,240
to concentrate polluters.

524
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:11,000
Basically, the thinking is,
if you are zoned for industry,

525
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:14,039
and a company's already there,
what's one more?

526
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,240
But people live in those zones.

527
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:20,279
And one such area in Louisiana
has even come to be known

528
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:22,079
by an incredibly bleak name.

529
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,480
More than 100 petrochemical
plants and refineries

530
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:28,839
dot this corridor between New Orleans
and Baton Rouge,

531
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,319
often referred to as Cancer Alley.

532
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:33,759
Reserve is right in the middle of it.

533
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:39,359
The EPA says the cancer risk here is
almost 50 times the national average.

534
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:42,440
They built this monstrosity
up on top of us.

535
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,880
Even the town's cemetery
is surrounded by a refinery.

536
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,960
Putting an oil refinery around
a cemetery is pretty on the nose.

537
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,799
But also, let's not gloss
over the term "Cancer Alley".

538
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,039
It is pretty upsetting to learn that
that's a name for an actual place

539
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:59,880
where people live
and not what you'd assume:

540
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,440
a slang term
for the Marlboro Man's ass crack.

541
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,680
It's no wonder, frankly,
that residents of Cancer Alley

542
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:10,000
are so angry that industries have been
allowed to move in right next to them.

543
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:11,480
And yet, infuriatingly,

544
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:14,720
some local government officials
try to downplay the risks.

545
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,640
I think Cancer Alley, the term
Cancer Alley is a myth, really,

546
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,400
that needs to be debunked.

547
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,000
Data that we received
from the tumor registry

548
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,079
reports that this was not
Cancer Alley.

549
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,279
Okay, then!
But a few things on that.

550
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:33,480
First, a "tumor registry"
may be one of the saddest things

551
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,119
that I've ever brought up
on this show,

552
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,680
and we've talked about everything
from baby crib grenades

553
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,039
to orthodontic bullying to the elderly
being eaten by alligators.

554
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:44,359
One of those things is real,
and you'll never guess which one.

555
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,400
Mainly because two of those
are real.

556
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,920
But you should know that, since
that clip, researchers have, in fact,

557
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,519
found that "toxic air pollution
is linked to higher cancer rates

558
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,599
among impoverished
communities in Louisiana,"

559
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,960
including this guy's
fucking parish.

560
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,519
And while local politicians and
industry will be quick to point out

561
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:06,039
the potential economic and employment
benefits that come with industry,

562
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:10,119
as a local activist points out, that
is something of a devil's bargain.

563
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,119
If ISIS showed up

564
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,880
and they say they will create jobs,
would we let them in?

565
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:23,839
Exactly. And for the record, that man
is a retired three-star general.

566
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,319
So, when he is comparing
something to ISIS,

567
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,680
he's really comparing something
to ISIS.

568
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,200
And as residents there will point out,
they are in many ways trapped.

569
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,039
Why haven't you moved?

570
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,640
Why should I move?
How can I move?

571
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,039
I struggled all my life to build this.
Right now, in good conscience,

572
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,599
who would I
actually sell this house to?

573
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,920
What poor, unsuspecting family

574
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,880
would I trick into moving
into this death trap?

575
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:00,839
I know the reporter is just doing her
job there.

576
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,799
But that is such a ridiculous question

577
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,480
that that man would have been
fully within his right

578
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,200
to make the rest of that interview

579
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:08,880
the most passive aggressive
interaction of all time.

580
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,519
"Why don't I move?
Now you mention it,

581
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:14,519
I hadn't even considered moving away
from Cancer Alley!

582
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:18,160
It just sounded so nice to me!
What a great idea you just had!

583
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,799
Let me throw up
a Zillow listing for 'death trap'

584
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,839
and I'll just sit back and wait
for a bidding war to begin."

585
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,039
And when you put
all of this together,

586
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:28,400
a history of racist zoning,
ineffective regulation,

587
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,720
and a government that continues
to prioritize the profits of industry

588
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:35,400
over the health of people,
it is clear we have a massive problem.

589
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,039
And the good news is,

590
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:39,799
the current president
actually seems to agree with that.

591
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:43,240
The unrelenting
impact of climate change

592
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:46,039
affects every single,
solitary one of us.

593
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,440
Too often the brunt

594
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:51,480
falls disproportionately
on communities of color,

595
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:55,640
exacerbating the need
for environmental justice,

596
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,119
sorry, there's a bug.

597
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,799
Speaking of the environment.

598
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:03,559
I don't love that a bug undermined
the genuinely important point

599
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,079
that he was making there,
but I will say this:

600
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,079
at least now Biden knows
what it feels like

601
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,400
when someone creeps out
on the back of his neck.

602
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:15,000
But the fact is, though, Biden
did make environmental justice

603
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:17,519
a pillar of his campaign,
and since taking office,

604
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:20,400
he's promised, among other things,
to funnel 40 percent

605
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,559
of relevant climate investments
to disadvantaged communities,

606
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,400
and to issue a yearly scorecard
that measures progress.

607
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,599
Which sounds great.

608
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,200
Unfortunately, so far,

609
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,799
his administration still hasn't
set clear goals to accomplish this.

610
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,079
And even worse,
in February, it said

611
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,880
"race will not be a factor in deciding
where to focus efforts,"

612
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,920
which is pretty fucking infuriating.

613
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:44,759
And the administration
will point out that the Supreme Court,

614
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:46,160
in its current makeup,

615
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,119
is likely to strike down
any explicitly race-based policy.

616
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,640
Which may well be true.

617
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,440
But we're in a pretty
fucking backwards situation

618
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,079
when any solutions to this problem
have to be race-blind,

619
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:02,119
despite the fact that the causes
of it are so demonstrably not.

620
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,599
So, what can we do here?

621
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,720
As you've seen again
and again in the stories tonight,

622
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,960
it is local activists on the ground
who've been working tirelessly

623
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:12,400
to fight for their communities
and to gain concessions.

624
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,279
And they deserve much more support
from larger environmentalist groups,

625
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:18,440
even as they continue
leading the way.

626
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:22,039
As for the government level,
we need significant zoning reform

627
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:25,200
to keep polluters
and residents safely apart.

628
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,200
Because the status quo
is just not acceptable.

629
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,559
When this country

630
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,079
designates communities of color
as "sacrifice zones",

631
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:37,599
the message there is that the people
who live in them are expendable.

632
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,359
That it's okay for their kids
to not be able to play outside

633
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,039
and for their life spans
to be shorter.

634
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,640
And unless we make big steps
to address environmental racism

635
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,200
and call it what it is,

636
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,200
a brutal divide is gonna stay
in place in this country,

637
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:54,640
where some are treated
like they're worth protecting,

638
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,640
and others
like they can be sacrificed.

639
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,759
And now, this!

640
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,400
And now...

641
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,400
People on TV Read Rejected
License Plates Out Loud.

642
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:11,119
The Texas DMV rejected thousands
of personalized license plate requests,

643
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,319
saying "no way"
to some strange asks from drivers.

644
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Just know that someone already
tried "fartacus" and was denied.

645
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,039
Requests like "fat ace",

646
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,759
Or how about this one,
"F-A-C-K" and the word "ewe".

647
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:27,279
The driver said
he's involved in breeding sheep.

648
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:29,079
"Rump," "hitman,"

649
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,839
"poop," and "byt3me."

650
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,079
"01d fart," using zero as the O.

651
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,920
"H00ker," using zeroes for the O's,
and "XXX sexy."

652
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,559
I'm looking
at one right here that's "boobaru."

653
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,160
One person requested a tag
from the state that said "(...)"...

654
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,880
Pam," "(...) Ned,"
"(...) me."

655
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,279
"Imnaked," now that's fun.

656
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:56,240
"Ifarted," come on,
that's hilarious.

657
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:58,960
Let's see what we've got here.
"Smart (...),"

658
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,480
"naked1," "naked,"
"hooters," sexual.

659
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,000
"Drpoop," again,
profanity or offensive.

660
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,440
"Eta (...),"
I mean, that's a sexual suggestion

661
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:10,800
and I don't have to go
any further than that, do I?

662
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:14,599
"Quikee," "shag,"
"porkin," "(...) off,"

663
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,880
"kismy (...)"...

664
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,000
I think we've covered them all
pretty nicely here.

665
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,719
Thanks so much for watching,
we'll see you next week. Good night!
