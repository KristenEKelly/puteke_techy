00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,510
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,790
Welcome "Last Week Tonight"!

3
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,750
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

4
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,550
It has clearly been a very busy week,
because we don't even have time

5
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,550
to get into the fact
that Ketanji Brown Jackson

6
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,590
became the first Black woman
nominated to the Supreme Court,

7
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,470
or that the governor of Texas
decided to target trans children

8
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,350
and their parents
for no fucking reason whatsoever.

9
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,270
And that is because we clearly
have to begin tonight with Ukraine.

10
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,870
It is the story that you've either
been persistently avoiding

11
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,110
because it's stressing you out, or that
you've been following obsessively,

12
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,670
for the exact same reason.

13
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,110
As we are all now painfully aware,

14
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,190
Vladimir Putin, Russian president
and World War III edgelord,

15
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,910
began an assault on the second-largest
country in Europe this week,

16
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,150
shelling several cities
and sending troops across the border.

17
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,270
It has been horrifying to watch,

18
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,790
and CNN, during its coverage
of air raid sirens in Kyiv,

19
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,510
somehow found a way
to make it even worse

20
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,950
with this terrible transition
to break.

21
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:45,630
And a little bit of chicken fried.
Cold beer on a Friday night.

22
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:50,750
A pair of jeans that fit just right
and the radio up.

23
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,390
Get five boneless wings for $1
with any handcrafted burger.

24
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,470
Only at Applebee's.

25
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,910
Yeah, it's not great, is it?

26
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,110
And it's not just that it cut to
a commercial for a restaurant chain

27
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,270
whose food can only be described
as "sometimes warm".

28
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,550
It's just so aggressively American.

29
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,950
From the country song that thinks
listing food counts as lyrics

30
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:15,350
all the way to this human Boot Barn
shaking his non-existent ass.

31
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,270
Applebee's actually put out a statement
afterward apologizing, saying,

32
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,990
"We are deeply concerned
about the situation in Ukraine,

33
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,910
the ad never should have aired,

34
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,470
and we are disappointed
in the actions of the network."

35
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,230
And that is some deft
international diplomacy

36
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,550
from the home of both the grilled
"Oriental" chicken salad

37
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,310
and the tipsy leprechaun.

38
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,870
And you know
when Applebee's is apologizing

39
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,990
for interrupting the coverage
of Russia invading Ukraine,

40
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,630
this week got seriously out of hand.

41
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,230
Condemnation of Putin's invasion
has been widespread,

42
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,990
from the UN secretary general,
the Pope, and even George W. Bush,

43
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,590
who stated,
"I join the international community

44
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,070
in condemning Putin's unprovoked
and unjustified invasion of Ukraine".

45
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:03,390
And hold on, George, not from you.
You are not the guy for this one.

46
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,270
Because that statement only would
have made sense if it ended with,

47
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,830
"Oh shit, now I hear it.
Sorry, I'll shut the fuck up now."

48
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,270
For the time being, instead
of putting troops on the ground,

49
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,550
countries around the world announced
a flurry of sanctions on Russia.

50
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,670
But Putin seems
to have taken that into account,

51
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,150
because in the eight years
since invading Crimea,

52
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,430
he's taken steps to
blunt their impact,

53
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,830
by restructuring Russia's economy
for the specific purpose

54
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,590
of withstanding
western financial pressure.

55
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,110
It's just one of the many ways

56
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,950
in which, as shocking as the speed
of this week's events may have been,

57
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,910
they were actually
depressingly predictable.

58
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,350
Putin has been laying the groundwork
for this for years.

59
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,070
State media there has long pushed
fake stories of Ukrainian brutality,

60
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,470
including, at one point,
alleging that the Ukrainian military

61
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,430
had tortured
and then crucified a three-year-old,

62
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,510
a claim for which,
"No one could turn up any evidence",

63
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,950
and which "is widely accepted
to have been a fabrication".

64
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,070
And that is just one incident
of many.

65
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,830
Just this year, Russian state media
has been airing "false flag" videos

66
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,270
to try and build a pretext
for an invasion,

67
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,110
some of which
were pretty sloppily put together.

68
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,830
On February 18th, pro-Russian
separatists released a video

69
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,390
purporting to show
a gun battle in a forest.

70
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,790
ABC News confirms the video file
appears to have been created

71
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,110
on February 8th, 10 days
earlier than the alleged attack.

72
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,230
Further analysis by ABC News
and Bellingcat

73
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,430
indicate that some of the explosions
in the video

74
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,910
were actually taken from a 2010
Finnish defense forces training video.

75
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,190
Come on, Russia!

76
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,870
You're stealing explosions
from Finnish defense forces?

77
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,670
If you're going to go
to the trouble of faking footage,

78
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,270
at least put some effort in.

79
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,590
Steal the whole thing,

80
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,590
and then throw in some T-Rexes in
from "Jurassic Park," as well.

81
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,230
Why not at least have some fun
with your lies

82
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,910
as you're dragging a continent
into a pointless war?

83
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,590
The point here is, this has been
in the works for a very long time.

84
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,070
Putin frame the invasion
as the "denazification" of Ukraine,

85
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,590
and thought, "Hold on,
that's a very weird thing to say".

86
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,910
But he's been making
that bullshit case for years now,

87
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,070
despite the fact
Ukraine's current president

88
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,870
is "both Jewish and had family
members die in the Holocaust".

89
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,350
And I don't want to play
"who's the biggest Nazi?" here.

90
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,990
That, after all, is what Twitter is for.
But between Zelensky and Putin,

91
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,630
if you are looking for
who is more like Hitler,

92
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,390
I'm just going to go
with the ethno-nationalist despot

93
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,510
invading sovereign
European territory

94
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,030
and who is also
a terrible fucking painter.

95
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,430
Putin has doggedly pursued this,

96
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,470
and has not seemed to want to hear
any arguments against it.

97
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,990
This week began
when Putin officially recognized

98
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,150
these two regions in Ukraine
as independent,

99
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,310
which set the invasion in motion.

100
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,270
And in a security council
meeting at the Kremlin on Monday,

101
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,590
just watch how he dressed down
his own spy chief

102
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:57,230
after the man suggested maybe
trying diplomacy one last time.

103
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,070
I would agree with Nikolai
Platonovich's proposal

104
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:09,350
that we can give our so-called
western partners one last chance.

105
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:15,710
Otherwise, we have to make
the decision we are discussing today.

106
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:20,190
What does that mean, "otherwise?" Are
you suggesting we start negotiations?

107
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,710
No, I...

108
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,710
Or recognize
sovereignty of the republics?

109
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,830
I will...

110
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,590
Speak directly!

111
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,950
I will support
the proposal of recognition...

112
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,390
You will support,
or you do support?

113
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,670
- Speak directly!
- I am supporting the proposal...

114
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,470
Then say it like that, yes or no.

115
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:49,030
I am supporting the proposal
about the entry of the Donetsk

116
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,310
and Luhansk People's Republics
into the Russian Federation.

117
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,750
We're not talking about that.
We are not discussing that.

118
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,110
We're talking about recognizing
their independence or not.

119
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:05,110
Yes. I support the proposal
to recognize their independence.

120
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,590
All right. Thanks.
You can take your seat.

121
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,750
Putin is a lot of things.

122
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:16,270
He's an autocrat, a tyrant, a warmonger
but he's also kind of a huge bitch.

123
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,990
Unfortunately for that guy,

124
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,670
he clearly forgot the best strategy
for public speaking in Russia,

125
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,670
which is, just imagine the entire
audience in their underwear

126
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,790
and Vladimir Putin
pointing a pistol at your head.

127
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,750
It really focuses the mind.

128
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,790
Look, what Russia is doing in Ukraine
is completely indefensible.

129
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,270
Even Putin allies like Hungarian
Prime Minister Viktor Orban

130
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,870
are coming out against it.

131
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,070
You cannot make a case
for what is happening.

132
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,950
And when you even try as Russia's
ambassador to Ireland did this week,

133
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,710
it just sounds ridiculous.

134
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,790
It's not our choice.

135
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,750
The war...

136
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:59,270
The military option,
is not our choice.

137
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,830
But, sir, your forces have invaded
a sovereign nation,

138
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,110
it was your choice.

139
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,070
It was not our preferable choice.

140
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,830
Why should our government
entertain your presence here

141
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,630
when you're acting
as an apologist for slaughter?

142
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,710
It's a good question.

143
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:23,950
You might ask that your government,
it's up to them.

144
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,750
He just asked you why Ireland
should allow you to stay there

145
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:32,230
as an apologist for slaughter,
and you said, "Good question?"

146
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,430
That really didn't seem to me
like a gotcha question,

147
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,870
and yet somehow,
you just got got.

148
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,430
That's actually a pretty
good reminder that Ireland,

149
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,470
in addition to being known
for eye-shatteringly

150
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,790
beautiful meadows
and free-flowing sheep,

151
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:50,030
is also known for taking absolutely
zero shit from occupying armies.

152
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,790
Believe me!

153
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:58,550
And it is notable that despite
all the anti-Ukraine propaganda

154
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,950
that Putin has pushing
on his people over the years,

155
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,030
and the fact that he so fiercely
cracks down on dissent,

156
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,750
there have still been massive
demonstrations against the war

157
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,790
in major Russian cities this week.

158
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,150
And the fact is that for many Russians,
this is a heartbreaking situation.

159
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,630
It hurts 'cause it's our friends,
our relatives.

160
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:22,630
I'm sorry, I'm so shocked.
I just can't help crying.

161
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:29,790
I think that most Russians
don't support this. It's horrible.

162
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,870
I feel sorry for people there.
I feel sorry for us.

163
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,590
I don't like it and I don't want it
to be like that at all.

164
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,350
- Do you know people in Ukraine?
- Yep. I'm actually in love with one.

165
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,590
So, I don't know what to say.
It's a tragedy.

166
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,110
Yeah, it is.
This whole thing is a tragedy.

167
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,030
No long-distance relationship

168
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,030
should have to end
because of a land war in Europe.

169
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,750
We know they should only end the way
all long-distance relationships do:

170
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,950
eventually.

171
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:06,870
Now, as for Ukrainians,
they are resisting hard.

172
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,110
Videos have made the rounds
this week, like this one,

173
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,190
of a woman offering Russian soldiers
sunflower seeds,

174
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,670
the seeds
of Ukraine's national flower.

175
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,870
There are deep signs of defiance,
people who are unwilling to yield.

176
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,750
This woman confronted heavily
armed Russian soldiers.

177
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,030
You're occupiers!
You're fascists!

178
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,630
You've come to our soil, why the fuck
did you come here with your guns?

179
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,950
Take these seeds here,
these raw seeds,

180
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,590
so that at least the sunflowers
will grow once you die here.

181
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:39,150
Our conversation won't lead anywhere,
so let's not escalate the situation.

182
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,310
- Please.
- What situation?

183
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,910
Please,
let's not escalate the situation.

184
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,310
Our conversation
won't lead anywhere.

185
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,630
Guys!
Put the seeds in your pockets.

186
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,150
Our conversation
won't result in anything.

187
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,910
Put the flower seeds in your pockets,
you'll die here with the seeds.

188
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,790
You came to my land. Do you
understand? You're the occupiers.

189
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,950
You're the enemy.

190
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,550
And from this second
you're already cursed. I'm telling you.

191
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,630
- Let's not escalate the situation.
- How can you escalate it any further?

192
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,430
You came here fucking uninvited.
Pieces of shit!

193
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,470
Good for her!

194
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:16,430
And let's recognize for a second
how ice-cold that insult is.

195
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,950
"Take these seeds
and put them in your pocket

196
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,830
so sunflowers will grow
when you die".

197
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,150
That is fucking brutal.

198
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:29,990
That woman brought seeds to a gunfight
and somehow still comfortably won.

199
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,870
I know that this is all
tough to watch.

200
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,670
And right now, especially as we are
taping this on Saturday,

201
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,390
I have a lot more questions
than answers.

202
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,790
Questions like, "What are
the days ahead going to bring?"

203
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,910
"Can Ukraine
possibly survive this?"

204
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,710
And, "What form might
that survival even take?"

205
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,870
But I will say the acts of selflessness
and bravery on display this week

206
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,070
have offered
a small glimmer of hope,

207
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,710
as has the extent of global
condemnation for what Putin is doing.

208
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:03,430
And when you put all of it together,
it is enough to make you wonder,

209
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:07,230
after committing
a barbaric criminal act such as this,

210
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,750
how can Putin possibly expect the
world, or indeed the Russian people,

211
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,390
to respect or support him
ever again?

212
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,110
I don't know
the answer to that,

213
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,630
but if I may paraphrase
his own ambassador,

214
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,710
it is a good fucking question.

215
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,390
And now this!

216
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,390
And Now: A Look Back
at Notable Moments in History.

217
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,790
Tonight, I can report to the American
people and to the world

218
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:36,550
that the United States has conducted an
operation that killed Osama bin Laden...

219
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:42,670
And a little bit of chicken fried.
Cold beer on a Friday night.

220
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,030
From Dallas, Texas.
The flash, apparently official.

221
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,830
President Kennedy died
at 1:00 PM central standard...

222
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,830
And a little bit of chicken fried.
Cold beer on a Friday night.

223
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,790
We, the jury, in the above-entitled
action find the defendant,

224
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,950
Orenthal James Simpson...

225
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,910
And a little bit of chicken fried.
Cold beer on a Fri...

226
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,070
Diana Princess of Wales
has died after a car crash...

227
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,150
And a little bit of chicken fried.

228
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,070
The humanity!

229
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,270
Cold beer on a Friday night.

230
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,950
Supreme Court Associate
Justice Ruth Bader Gins...

231
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,390
A pair of jeans that fit just right.
And the radio up.

232
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,670
Moving on.

233
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,870
Our main story
tonight concerns sex.

234
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,470
The thing that cute little bird
outside your window

235
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,270
is constantly screaming about.

236
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,830
It's true! It's yelling "Sex, sex,
I'm horny, who wants sex?"

237
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,310
Just try and remember that as your
grandmother is gazing peacefully at it.

238
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,990
Sex is a topic that, historically, we've
not been very good at talking about.

239
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,670
- You know something?
- No, what?

240
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,470
- I had a wet dream last night.
- Wet dream? What's that?

241
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,630
- When sperm comes out of your penis.
- Sperm?

242
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,630
- Didn't your brother tell you about it?
- No.

243
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:03,110
Wait, hold on.
You're not his brother?

244
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,470
What the fuck?

245
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,670
Then why are you talking
about sperm with some random kid?

246
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,390
It feels like the main takeaway
from that video

247
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,510
should be to stay away
from creepy teenagers

248
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,870
who like to chat up neighborhood
tweens about their wet penis.

249
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,270
Specifically tonight,
we're going to talk about sex work.

250
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,670
And the concept is pretty simple.

251
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,870
Let's say you have sex, any kind...
missionary, doggie, cowgirl, cowboy,

252
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,550
the eagle, the wheelbarrow,
the wild chincoteague pony,

253
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,550
the Jerry Seinfeld,
the pick-me-up, the put-me-down,

254
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:36,230
mouth-butt, butt-mouth, mouth-mouth
butt-butt, butt-butt mouth butt...

255
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,070
You know, whatever.
But then that's it.

256
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,950
You go home.
It's fine, right? It's fine.

257
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,190
But let's say you have sex,
but afterwards,

258
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,990
you get money, or a chocolate bar,
or one of those participation trophies.

259
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,270
Way better, right?
Too bad, it's illegal.

260
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:54,310
Very basically, sex work is the exchange
of sex for money or goods,

261
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,550
and in the United States,

262
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,590
a complicated patchwork of local,
state, and federal laws

263
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:02,990
makes that act illegal everywhere
except for a few counties in Nevada.

264
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,310
And if you're thinking,
"Hold on, John..."

265
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,510
Didn't Donald Sutherland
and Julie Christie

266
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,750
have sex for real in 'Don't Look Now'
and also get paid at least scale?

267
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,350
Wouldn't that be illegal?"

268
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,750
The answer is one, yes, I also believe
that rumor, great reference,

269
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,190
and two, that is actually legal
because of the presence of the camera,

270
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,110
making it an "art film",
otherwise known as "porn"

271
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,070
and thus, legally,
covered as part of free speech.

272
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:30,230
So basically, consensual sex for money
on camera is legal porn,

273
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:34,270
and consensual sex for money
off-camera is illegal sex work.

274
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,830
Makes sense, right?
Wrong? Exactly.

275
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,790
Everything about the way
we regulate sex work in this country

276
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,590
is confusing
and counterproductive.

277
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,710
And when we talk about it,
it's often either demonizing,

278
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,190
patronizing, or just plain wrong.

279
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,470
And in some cases,
all three at once.

280
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,150
It was once called
the world's oldest profession,

281
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,510
you know the names: prostitute, tramp,
call girl, hooker, even whore.

282
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,350
If that didn't get your attention,
this right here will.

283
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,150
Most are really victims,
people being sex trafficked.

284
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:06,830
First of all, they're actually not,
for reasons that we'll get into later.

285
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,670
But setting that aside,
if you're going to talk about someone,

286
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,430
maybe don't start the sentence
by insulting them.

287
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,590
It's like saying,
"You know him as a dickhead.

288
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,230
A fuck weasel.
A stingy, unlikeable bitch.

289
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,550
And today, at his funeral,
we remember Uncle Todd."

290
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:25,590
Because as long as sex work has
existed, so have efforts to stop it.

291
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,990
And it comes in many forms,

292
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,150
from people who object to it
on moral grounds,

293
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,950
to those who associate it
with crime,

294
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,470
to those who want the practice
permanently ended,

295
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,750
as they believe all sex work
is exploitation

296
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,710
and absolutely cannot be done
consensually.

297
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,510
But a human history's
worth of shitty laws

298
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:45,590
hasn't changed the fact that, one, sex
work has always been part of society,

299
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,230
appealing to every interest
and every kind of clientele.

300
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,150
And, two, sex workers
are not a monolith.

301
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,950
People from a variety of backgrounds
do it for a variety of reasons.

302
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,590
And the fact is, our current system
of criminalizing the trade

303
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,630
and driving everyone underground

304
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,470
is actually only making life harder
for the most vulnerable involved.

305
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,110
And given that sex workers are,
and this is true,

306
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,190
people with thoughts
about their own fucking situation,

307
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,710
we thought tonight,
we'd actually listen to them.

308
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:16,230
Let's start with the fact that this is
not going to be a piece about morality.

309
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,750
You might well think people should
only have sex during a full moon,

310
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,470
wearing a three-piece suit,
and with their common-law horse.

311
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,270
That is your business.

312
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,550
This story is going to be
about the fact that sex work

313
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,470
is, inarguably, labor. It is a job.

314
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,390
And people do it for the same
reasons people do any job,

315
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,990
as this advocate explains.

316
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:40,950
Sex work is inherently work.
It's how people feed their families.

317
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,870
It's how people
put clothes on their backs.

318
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,950
It's how people survive.

319
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,590
I've been a sex worker.
I've been a lawyer.

320
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,310
I've served sandwiches
at Subway.

321
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,310
I've folded clothes at Abercrombie.
All those are work.

322
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,070
Right, it's all work!

323
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,110
The main difference between sex work
and working at a Subway

324
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,270
is that at least in sex work
you know what the customer's eating.

325
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,150
And yet some people
feel highly uncomfortable

326
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,630
with the
very idea that sex work is labor

327
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,830
and should therefore be
treated as such.

328
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,950
Watch a New York
state assemblyman

329
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,310
struggle to even get his head
around that.

330
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:20,910
We've got hookers roaming the
Capitol now, lobbying to be legalized.

331
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,670
I can't even imagine
what that looks like.

332
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,390
But they're lobbying,
and they're talking health insurance,

333
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,550
fair wages,
all the things that come with it.

334
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,430
So, this has really,
really gotten out of hand.

335
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,430
Yeah, can you imagine!

336
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,790
An organized group of citizens
lobbying their state government

337
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,430
for access
to basic human rights!

338
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,230
This has gotten well out of hand.

339
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,190
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go continue styling my hair

340
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,270
like a famously racist cartoon.

341
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:52,510
Now, part of his reluctance there
is probably his general dick vibe,

342
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,910
but it also points
to something much bigger.

343
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,750
And that is the argument
that, as that anchor just said,

344
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,790
"Most sex workers are victims,

345
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,790
and what they need is someone
to step in and save them."

346
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,830
And one of the biggest groups
that loves to do that is the police,

347
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,990
who often position themselves
as saviors for sex workers,

348
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,950
even as they are arresting
and jailing them.

349
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:16,950
I've talked to numerous survivors
that say it saved their life.

350
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,510
- Being arrested?
- Yes.

351
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:22,710
We open the door for help. And if we
don't do that, who's going to do it?

352
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,390
If I don't offer them help,
who's gonna?

353
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,270
There's no one
going to help them.

354
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:31,590
Hold on. 'Cause first, if that is true,
that no one else is going to help them,

355
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,270
then you're pointing at a gigantic
problem that needs to be fixed.

356
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,630
'Cause arresting someone
isn't usually considered

357
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,790
the best way
of providing assistance.

358
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,830
That is why there isn't a thank you
section in Hallmark called

359
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,990
"for your arresting officer".

360
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:49,150
'Cause I think we can all agree,
if there are people doing sex work

361
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,830
who don't want to be doing it,

362
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:54,990
we should absolutely be aiding
their transition out of that situation.

363
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,430
But the question here is,
are we doing that right now?

364
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,790
Let's look at some of the methods that
police use in dealing with sex workers

365
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,950
which can be traumatizing, invasive,
and occasionally unbelievably cruel,

366
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,870
like this undercover sting
from an episode of "Cops".

367
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,230
So, how about
a little clown action?

368
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,790
- Should I get in?
- Come on!

369
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,390
Surveillance unit, she's getting
in the van in the front passenger seat.

370
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,230
- You're not police, are you?
- As a matter of fact...

371
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,310
Coco, please!

372
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,630
- Please step out of the car.
- We're not doing nothing.

373
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,230
Hands behind your back!

374
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,710
- We're not doing nothing.
- Relax.

375
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,590
You're under arrest for prostitution.

376
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,670
Yeah, only one of those people
ended up in handcuffs

377
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,710
and it somehow
wasn't the guy who said,

378
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:43,510
"How about some clown action",
before jizzing silly string.

379
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,590
This is not the most important point.
In fact, it's arguably the least,

380
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,830
but that's not a clown hat,
it's a "Cat in the Hat" hat.

381
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:55,470
And I'll admit, I'm not an expert on
clown attire for prostitution stings.

382
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:59,510
But I know a hat mistake when I see
one, and that is a hat mistake.

383
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,550
Hat mistake!

384
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,670
Exactly.

385
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,750
It is no wonder many sex workers
have trouble

386
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:10,990
regarding the police as their saviors,
especially as cops have a reputation

387
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:14,070
for acting violently
or inappropriately during stings.

388
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,390
A couple of years ago in Arizona,
federal agents allegedly engaged in

389
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:21,230
"17 sexual encounters with women
working in massage parlors,"

390
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:25,790
as part of an investigation disgustingly
codenamed "Operation Asian Touch",

391
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,470
And the thing is, that's not uncommon,
because in many states,

392
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,750
it is not specifically illegal for police
officers to have sex with workers

393
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,110
during the course
of a sting operation.

394
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,070
And in some states, police have
protested efforts to ban the practice.

395
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,030
Which is both grotesque
and also a bit ironic

396
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,270
because what they're fundamentally
arguing there

397
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:49,030
is that they should be able
to have sex for their jobs legally

398
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,510
in order to stop people having sex
for their jobs.

399
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,070
And even without that provision,

400
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,990
the laws police can use to arrest
or intimidate sex workers

401
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,710
are shockingly broad.

402
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,510
If you work in the sex trade,

403
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:05,190
the threat of arrest looms large
over your entire existence.

404
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,990
This is another area

405
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,670
that disproportionately
affects people of color.

406
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,070
One recent investigation found
that, from 2016 to 2020,

407
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:18,670
almost everyone arrested by the NYPD
for buying or selling sex was nonwhite.

408
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,990
One particularly problematic law
is the prohibition against

409
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,790
"loitering for the purpose
of prostitution".

410
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,190
It's basically a stop-and-frisk
policy for sex workers.

411
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,230
And in New York,
it's written so vaguely,

412
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:33,910
the NYPD has used it to interpret
completely legal activities

413
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:39,190
like talking to pedestrians or dressing
provocatively as a basis for an arrest.

414
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,790
Cops have used the law
to arrest people

415
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:44,150
because they wore "black cowboy
boots, and black shorts,"

416
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,990
and "a multi-color short dress
and sandals."

417
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,510
And in one case,
a woman was arrested

418
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:52,110
because "her clothes exposed
her buttocks and cervix area,"

419
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:56,070
which isn't so much a crime
as it is an urgent medical emergency.

420
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,310
Meanwhile, in some states,
cops have seized condoms

421
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,190
and used them
as evidence of prostitution,

422
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,390
or even charged people
with a misdemeanor called

423
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,630
"possessing an instrument of crime"
for carrying them.

424
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,950
And criminalizing condoms
has led some sex workers

425
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:15,310
to hide them or even go without,
as this worker in Queens explains.

426
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,550
You ask where we hide our condoms.

427
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,590
We hide condoms in our private parts,
where they won't touch us.

428
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,590
We should be able to carry condoms
to protect ourselves

429
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,430
and to protect
the people we are with.

430
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,230
The authorities show
a real lack of intelligence

431
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,710
when they say
it's a crime to carry condoms.

432
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:43,390
In the transgender community,
not carrying condoms is a death wish.

433
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,350
That is just ridiculous.

434
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:50,430
Putting aside the fact
"it's a crime to carry condoms"

435
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,430
sounds like the name of a Christian
boy band's self-released album,

436
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,630
which it absolutely does,
by the way.

437
00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:00,190
What you're doing there is genuinely
making sex workers' jobs less safe.

438
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,790
That is not the only way

439
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:05,190
our current policies
harm those that they claim to help.

440
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,590
A criminal record can limit
a sex worker's future opportunities

441
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,270
should they want to leave the field.

442
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,110
Because while most sex-related
crimes are classified as misdemeanors,

443
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,390
in some states,
including all these,

444
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:20,310
repeated arrests can result
in a felony conviction and prison time.

445
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,150
And for a while, in Louisiana, some
of those arrested for doing sex work

446
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,750
wound up having to register
as sex offenders,

447
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,830
which is particularly galling.

448
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:32,790
If anyone you've seen so far tonight
should be labeled a sex offender,

449
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,350
it's all the cops who've ever had sex
during a sting,

450
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,590
and again, that fucking clown.

451
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:43,830
And look, I don't want
to paint too rosy a picture here.

452
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,350
Sex work can be dangerous.

453
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,830
And we need to be talking,
constructively,

454
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,830
about how to make it safer
in every possible way.

455
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:54,590
But a reason it's hard
to have that conversation

456
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:58,030
is that sex work so often gets
conflated with something else,

457
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,790
and that is human trafficking.

458
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:03,430
And let me first say that, of course,
human trafficking is real,

459
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,590
and when it happens,
it's absolutely horrific.

460
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,910
You immediately think
of Jeffrey Epstein and...

461
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,990
Am I legally allowed to say
Prince Andrew?

462
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:13,430
I'm not? Are you sure about that?
You're totally sure?

463
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,870
Okay, forget I said it, then.

464
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,390
But the concept
of human trafficking

465
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,590
looms large in the conversation
around sex work.

466
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:27,150
You've probably seen massive numbers
get thrown around online,

467
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,430
despite the fact experts
will tell you,

468
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:33,350
"Getting an accurate count on those
subjected to forced sex or labor

469
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,870
has eluded researchers for years."

470
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:39,110
And look, any number north
of zero is clearly terrible.

471
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:43,030
But far too often, attempts
to crack down on sex trafficking

472
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:46,230
will conflate it with consensual,
adult sex work.

473
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,630
The implicit assumption

474
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:51,110
is that no sex worker
has ever entered the trade by choice,

475
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:55,670
even when that is, by their own
testimony, not the case.

476
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,870
And some states have even written
that assumption into law.

477
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,350
In 2012, lawmakers in Alaska

478
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:04,270
amended their laws
on "promoting prostitution"

479
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,110
to replace that phrase
with "sex trafficking",

480
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:11,470
resulting in one case where a woman
was charged with trafficking herself.

481
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:15,110
Which is obviously absurd,
unless they were making a larger point

482
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,390
about our collective lack
of free will under capitalism.

483
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,470
And if it is the latter, I'd say, bro.
Not the time.

484
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,750
Not the time, bro.

485
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:27,990
And the thing is, badly written laws
can have massive consequences.

486
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,470
Take FOSTA.

487
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,070
It's a federal law
that was positioned

488
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,230
as a way to crack down
on sex trafficking

489
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:37,230
by banning online ads
that sold people into sex slavery.

490
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,430
Which sounds good, right?

491
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,270
What kind of monster
would be against that?

492
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,870
But what it did was ban ads
for all paid sex,

493
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:47,270
whether or not trafficking
was involved.

494
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:51,550
It was part of a much larger push
to shut down sites where sex was sold,

495
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:55,190
along with the shuttering of Backpage
and Craigslist's personals section.

496
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:59,310
And while undeniably, some very bad
things were advertised on those sites,

497
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:03,790
they also enabled sex workers to find
clients and communicate with them,

498
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:08,270
which was a much safer way for them
to do that than operating on the street.

499
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,670
And if you're thinking

500
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:13,310
"It's bad that sex workers
lost a way to stay safer,

501
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,990
but at least moves like those
helped law enforcement

502
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:20,470
crack down on sex trafficking,"
the thing is, not really.

503
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,110
In the three years
after FOSTA was passed,

504
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,310
prosecutors said
they'd only used it once.

505
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,910
And as for shutting down Backpage,

506
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,230
that actually made it even harder
to catch sex traffickers.

507
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,510
The site was U.S.-based
and was often willing

508
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:36,590
to work with law enforcement
to root out the bad actors.

509
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:40,550
And with it gone, law enforcement
suddenly found tracking them down

510
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,190
to be much more difficult.

511
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:46,390
So, now we're just trying
to figure out where everybody's going.

512
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,110
So, these new websites
have popped up.

513
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:54,710
Bedpage, which is almost
an exact replica of Backpage.

514
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,990
Then we've got OneBackpage.

515
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:02,870
Basically, it's all of these
different websites now

516
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:07,190
that we don't have any agreements
or search tools with,

517
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,830
and they've kind of spread out.

518
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,950
So, we don't have a certain location
to go look for them anymore,

519
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,670
and it's kind of a crapshoot.

520
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,790
Yeah, that's not ideal, is it?

521
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,670
And of all the questions that raises,
I would also like to ask:

522
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,750
what the fuck is going on
with her cubicle decor?

523
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:28,630
It involves not this prominently
displayed Pimpin' Ave street sign,

524
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,950
weird enough on its own,
but also a glass goblet featuring

525
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,910
rhinestones that spell out the phrase
"Ho Fo' Sho".

526
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,150
Which is a pretty weird tone
to strike

527
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:40,150
for a workplace that rescues
sex trafficking victims.

528
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,590
Those look more like the decorations
you'd find at a bachelorette party

529
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:46,630
where the guests wind up vomit-crying
out the window of a speeding party bus.

530
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:50,430
And obviously, law enforcement
should be pursuing sex trafficking

531
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,870
wherever it takes place.

532
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,710
But unfortunately,
the police will often re-frame

533
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:58,950
traditional prostitution stings
as human trafficking ones.

534
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,830
You might remember a large sting
operation a few years back

535
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,630
of multiple
massage parlors in Florida,

536
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,030
in which Robert Kraft,
the owner of the Patriots,

537
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,070
was charged
with soliciting prostitution.

538
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,950
And the initial comments
from law enforcement

539
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:13,550
strongly suggested
that the workers at the day spa Kraft

540
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,990
went to were part
of a sex trafficking ring.

541
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:19,390
The prosecutor was even happy to brag
about their humanitarian mission

542
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,430
in his press conference
after the raid.

543
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:25,110
I'd like to thank the men and women
of the Jupiter Police Department

544
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:28,990
for their professionalism and
diligence in investigating these cases.

545
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,670
You can tell
a lot about our community

546
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:35,150
by the way it treats
its most vulnerable individuals,

547
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,750
and that includes
victims of human trafficking.

548
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,710
He's actually right, you can tell
a lot about a community

549
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:44,230
by how it treats
its most vulnerable individuals.

550
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,350
And you should know,
months later, a prosecutor admitted

551
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,910
no human trafficking arose
from the investigation,

552
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:51,910
and Kraft's misdemeanor charges
were later dropped.

553
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,150
And yet, the state attorney's office

554
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,790
"continued to pursue
cases against the women,"

555
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,750
the ones they were supposedly
trying to rescue.

556
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:03,310
Eventually, four women who worked
at that spa were arrested and jailed,

557
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:07,710
with three fined thousands of dollars,
and one ending up in ICE detention.

558
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,670
And all of that is bad enough
until you learn that some of the help

559
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,150
offered to workers
caught up in the larger sting

560
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,350
consisted of this care package

561
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:18,310
that included Band-Aids,
mouthwash, razors,

562
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:21,310
and a booklet written
by megachurch pastor Rick Warren

563
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,830
titled "What on Earth
Am I Here For?"

564
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:27,110
Which is literally
only helpful if inside, it says,

565
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,110
"To be scapegoated in a
generations-long morality war

566
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,310
that has nothing to do with you
and everything to do

567
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:35,190
with how we as a society view sex,
money, and power."

568
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,510
And that is hardly
an exception here.

569
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,350
Just listen to Andrew Lewis,
the former coordinator

570
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:44,030
for the Greater New Orleans
Human Trafficking Task Force,

571
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,350
tell the Louisiana
House of Representatives

572
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:49,390
about one sting operation
that he personally witnessed.

573
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:53,950
What I saw was a standard operation,
and it was deeply troubling.

574
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:57,590
Agents pretending to be clients
set up dates with sex workers.

575
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,750
When a sex worker arrived
at the hotel room,

576
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,710
they would be arrested
and forced into another cold room,

577
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:05,510
often with very little clothing,
and interviewed.

578
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,910
The same agent
that handcuffed them

579
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,230
would then ask them
if they had been trafficked

580
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:13,590
and no matter their response,
they were arrested and booked.

581
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,350
At the end of the night, those arrests
were reported back to me

582
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:20,270
as prospective victims
of human trafficking.

583
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,950
Even when there was no evidence
of force, fraud, or coercion.

584
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:26,270
Let me be clear,
human trafficking does occur,

585
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,910
and likely more than we know.

586
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:31,310
But because we are spending
a majority of our time and money

587
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,230
on criminalizing
consensual adult sex work,

588
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:37,510
we're not able to help those
being actually forced to work

589
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:42,110
in the construction, agriculture, and,
yes, sex work industries in Louisiana.

590
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,070
Exactly. He's absolutely right.

591
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,790
We clearly should not be wasting
valuable resources

592
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,950
on arresting
consensual sex workers.

593
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,990
And we certainly should not be
interviewing them in cold rooms

594
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,230
while they're wearing
very little clothing.

595
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,870
It turns out, police aren't
so much "rescuing" people

596
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:01,190
as "lightly refrigerating them,
and then sending them to jail".

597
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,150
And when you take
all of this together,

598
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:06,990
it is no surprise that many workers who
have been robbed or abused by clients

599
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:10,310
report that they feel they
can't turn to the police for help.

600
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,550
And in some cases,

601
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,950
those who have turned to the police
say they deeply regret it.

602
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:20,790
I reported a rape from a client
I was supposed to be working with,

603
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:23,710
and I just wound up getting arrested.

604
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,990
I spent a long time in jail for...

605
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:30,030
For trying to report a rape,

606
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,230
and you just learn better.

607
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:36,830
No way I'll deal with the cops.
I'll get raped 100 times before I do.

608
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:41,070
Yeah. She went to report a rape
and ended up in jail.

609
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:44,670
I'd call it dystopian if it were
not so fucking American.

610
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,190
So, at every turn,
we are making life harder

611
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,470
both for people who want
to remain in the sex trade,

612
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,950
and for those
who want to leave it.

613
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,110
So, how do we fix this?

614
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:57,590
There are actually a few different
options open to us here.

615
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,870
And let's start
with the most restrictive.

616
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,870
Some advocate for something
called the Nordic model.

617
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:05,030
Which I know sounds like
the answer Leonardo DiCaprio

618
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,670
would give to the question,
"Who would you like to fuck?"

619
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:13,350
But the Nordic model is the one that
intuitively might make sense to you.

620
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:17,390
'Cause it criminalizes the buying
of sex, but not the selling of it.

621
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:20,550
So we would arrest the clients,
but not the workers,

622
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:23,030
the ones that you're presumably
concerned for.

623
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:25,430
It's been adopted in many countries,
including Sweden,

624
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,150
Finland, Norway, and France.

625
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,950
And while it might sound good
on the surface,

626
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:31,670
one problem with it
is that sex buyers

627
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,430
don't want to be arrested
any more than sex workers do.

628
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,990
Meaning that workers still have
to meet clients in the shadows.

629
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,830
So, for instance, it is still difficult
to vet them online.

630
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,670
And if you're on the street,
it can be even worse,

631
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,750
as this Swedish
sex worker explains.

632
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,270
Especially for the women on the street,
this has been very, very bad.

633
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:51,470
Because before they had this classic
thing hanging into the car window,

634
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,910
having the discussion,

635
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,830
"This is what I'm willing to sell.
This is what I'm willing to do."

636
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,590
They don't have the time anymore
because the clients are so jumpy,

637
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,950
so they have to get into the car,
drive off, and then negotiate.

638
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,670
And then they're already in the car.

639
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:07,350
Right. You can't tell
in a split second of looking at a car

640
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,910
if it's safe to get in.

641
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,110
It's not like there's a bumper sticker
that says

642
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:14,550
"My Child is an Honor Roll Student
and I'm a Fucking Sociopath"

643
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,790
to tip you off.

644
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:20,110
So, the truth is, many sex workers
don't love the Nordic model.

645
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,270
Another option we could go with
is legalization.

646
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:26,310
That is where workers
and clients can legally operate,

647
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,510
within certain regulations.

648
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:32,030
It's the model employed by Amsterdam
and some counties in Nevada.

649
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:35,870
There, sex workers are limited to
working as independent contractors

650
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:38,710
and must do so
in regulated brothels,

651
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:42,830
typically earning 40 to 50% of what
they bring in by servicing customers,

652
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:45,070
with the remainder
going to the brothel.

653
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:48,150
And if you're wondering
why those brothels get to take so much,

654
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,790
it is simply because they can.

655
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,470
Nevada essentially
gives them a monopoly.

656
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,390
That is just one reason why sex workers
tend not to be that keen

657
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,990
on the heavily regulated
legalization option, either.

658
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:05,670
Instead, what many of them advocate for
is something called decriminalization,

659
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,630
which very simply
removes all criminal penalties

660
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:11,390
for the buying
and selling of consensual sex.

661
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:14,230
It's a model currently
employed by New Zealand,

662
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,910
a country that does seem to make
a lot of smart choices,

663
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:20,550
with the glaring exception
of choosing a national bird.

664
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:24,270
Because what the fuck is up
with the kiwi, by the way?

665
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:28,150
It's an incorrect duck.
It's what you'd get if a first grader

666
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:30,910
was assigned to draw a bird
and then just forgot.

667
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,950
My point here is,
in New Zealand's system,

668
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:38,990
any sex worker can legally work
for themselves, or in a brothel.

669
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:42,070
And brothel owners have
to have special certificates

670
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:46,830
and verify their workers are over 18
and use safe sex practices.

671
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:51,030
But crucially, this system means that
sex workers have fundamental rights,

672
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,070
from being able to access
unemployment benefits,

673
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,030
to health care, to being covered
by workplace protections.

674
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:59,350
Sex workers there have successfully
sued over sexual harassment

675
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:03,230
they experienced in a brothel
and have been able to go to the police.

676
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:07,150
In fact, last year, a man was convicted
for rape in a stealthing case

677
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:10,150
after he removed a condom
without a sex worker's consent.

678
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:14,910
It is a human-rights-centered approach
that does seem to be working.

679
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,750
And a sex worker in New Zealand
gives credit for this

680
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:21,510
to the fact that the people
writing the laws did one key thing.

681
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,830
New Zealand seems to be
the only country that has got it right,

682
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,030
and that's because
they consulted sex workers

683
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:29,470
whereas any other country
doesn't talk to sex workers,

684
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:32,150
they just make plans
and laws for them

685
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,350
without discussing it with them
or caring about what they say.

686
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:38,990
Exactly. And it is sad
that that is so surprising.

687
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,430
Because unfortunately,
it seems most countries' laws

688
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:45,270
treat sex workers the exact same way
that we treat cats on Halloween.

689
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:49,550
Squeezing them into bad situations
without their input or consent,

690
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:52,030
and refusing to take their feelings
into consideration

691
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,190
when they're clearly
not that happy.

692
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:57,750
I'm not saying
the New Zealand model is perfect.

693
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,910
That woman herself
acknowledges that.

694
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:02,070
And there are
good-faith disagreements

695
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,670
to be had over the finer points
of a decriminalization policy.

696
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,990
But if we basically agree,
as I hope we do,

697
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:13,230
that making sex work safer
for the people who do it is a priority,

698
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:16,230
it is the direction to strive toward.

699
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,950
And we're actually taking some slow
steps in the right direction here.

700
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,790
New York recently
repealed its loitering law,

701
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:24,230
California seems poised
to do the same.

702
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,230
Meanwhile,
prosecutors around the country

703
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,830
have announced that they won't pursue
certain prostitution cases

704
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:32,390
and will dismiss thousands
of pending ones, which is great.

705
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:35,110
And look, to those
who are still uncomfortable here,

706
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,990
out of a concern
that there are people

707
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,590
who feel economically forced
into sex work,

708
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:43,750
I totally agree with you.
That is a huge problem.

709
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:48,070
But the fact is, our current laws
are not addressing that.

710
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,710
If you want to do that, that's a much
bigger conversation to have.

711
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:54,750
Because fundamentally, the only
way to make sure that people

712
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,550
have a choice
in the way they earn money

713
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,710
is to make housing affordable,
health care accessible,

714
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:01,110
and to not burden marginalized people
with criminal records

715
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:04,390
that lead to a cycle of joblessness,
homelessness, and desperation.

716
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:07,950
But until such time
as we have that conversation,

717
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:12,350
and it does not seem like something
enough people are itching to have now,

718
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:16,030
we need to stop pursuing policies
that harass, endanger,

719
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,670
and occasionally
refrigerate sex workers

720
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,390
and, instead, start listening
to what they want.

721
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,030
Because, unfortunately,
if we don't do that,

722
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:27,990
we're just going to carry on looking
like a bunch of fucking clowns.

723
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,550
And now, this!

724
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,870
And Now...

725
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:34,790
A Fond Farewell
to the Wendy Williams Show.

726
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,190
- How you doin'?
- Hi!

727
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,190
First-time customer, I see.

728
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:45,790
This is an accomplished woman
according to everybody but me.

729
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:46,990
I don't know who this is.

730
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,550
There is nothing worse
than an attractive killer.

731
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:53,790
What the criminology is going on?
What the Bruce Lee is going on?

732
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:56,310
What the Luther Vandross
is going on with you?

733
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,190
- Somebody's gonna get fired.
- Yes.

734
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,590
I think it should be you.

735
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:03,710
They took a massive runny dump
in a pair of Manolo Blahniks.

736
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,910
And I eat my baked potato
including the skin.

737
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,590
Clap if you eat the skin.
Clap if you have anxiety.

738
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:12,070
Clap if you think she should suffer,
if you've wanted to kill somebody.

739
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:16,310
- Where you going with this?
- I'm trying to push a burp down.

740
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:20,830
That's the problem when you start out
hot, there's nowhere to go but down.

741
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:23,590
He's so weak. I don't even understand
how she gets moist for him.

742
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,470
I'm about to disrespect you crazy.

743
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,230
That head is long, Lester.

744
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,950
Guilty!

745
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,830
Die!

746
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,110
How you doin'?

747
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,710
It's okay!

748
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:48,390
Thanks so much for watching.
See you next week. Good night!
