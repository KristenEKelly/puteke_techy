00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,519
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:33,479
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight"!
I'm John Oliver.

3
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,600
Thank you so much for joining us.
It has been another busy week.

4
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:39,439
Boris Johnson narrowly survived
a no-confidence vote,

5
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,359
the U.S. Postal Service
unveiled a Nancy Reagan stamp

6
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:45,119
in an apparent attempt
to cancel out Pride Month,

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,920
and the House committee
investigating January 6th

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,759
held its first prime-time hearing,

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,799
prompting a crisis
for conservative media.

10
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,960
Fox News opted not to air it at all,

11
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:58,039
and OAN went one step better,
airing a tribute to Trump instead,

12
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:00,960
featuring this exquisite
transition to commercials.

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,640
You have inspired countless,
millions

14
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,400
and shown our nation
what it truly means

15
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,239
to make America great, again.

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,920
For One America News,
I'm Pearson Sharp.

17
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,079
Generic Viagra
delivered within 48 hours

18
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,439
in discreet packaging on approval.

19
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,519
No one will know but you…

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,599
And your mailbox.

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,439
Perfect. Absolutely no notes.

22
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:31,640
With the sole exception of maybe
spare a thought for the mailbox there.

23
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:35,280
It got given a raging flag boner
by discreetly packaged pills,

24
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,519
and now it needs
to sit there frustrated

25
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,120
and hope for a pigeon
to land just right.

26
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,680
But we're going to start by checking
in on the midterm elections again.

27
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,480
In Arizona, currently represented
by two Democrats in the Senate:

28
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,040
Kyrsten Sinema,
the only senator who seems to buy

29
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,319
all her clothes exclusively
from girl boss pyramid schemes,

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,680
and Mark Kelly,
who is up for reelection.

31
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,560
Republicans actually think they have
a real chance of unseating him,

32
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,439
which has led
to a competitive primary.

33
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:03,159
The best-known contender
is probably Mark Brnovich,

34
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,560
Arizona's current AG,
and whose whole vibe

35
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,280
can probably best be summed up
by this video that he released

36
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,199
to celebrate the end
of the state's ban on nunchucks,

37
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,159
which proved so popular,
he later released this sequel.

38
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,439
People, you want more chucks?
You got more chucks.

39
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,000
I know that that is ridiculous,

40
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,639
but I personally am enjoying
Danny McBride's newest character

41
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,879
and I'm excited
to see where he goes with it.

42
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,000
But Brnovich faces resistance
from die-hard Trump supporters,

43
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,360
who feel that he didn't do enough
to try and overturn the 2020 election.

44
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:41,280
Which has opened up space
for candidates like Jim Lamon,

45
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,800
a retired energy executive
who has made waves with this TV spot.

46
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,759
OLD JOE

47
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,080
SHIFTY KELLY

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,560
CRAZYFACE PELOSI

49
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,960
The good people of Arizona
have had enough of you.

50
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,000
It's time for a showdown.

51
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,159
I'm Jim Lamon
and I approve this message.

52
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,960
You shouldn't have approved it, Jim,
because your ad is terrible.

53
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,960
Shifty Kelly
is supposed to be Mark Kelly,

54
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,360
who's married to Gabby Giffords, who
survived being shot in the head in 2011.

55
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,199
Shooting at her husband
is at best insensitive.

56
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,199
And it's frankly amazing that a grown
man dressed in a sheriff costume

57
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,639
that looks like it was discontinued
by Party City

58
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,280
is somehow just the second most
distasteful part of that ad.

59
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,240
But surprisingly,
Trump didn't endorse Lamon, either.

60
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,439
Instead, he's endorsed Blake Masters.

61
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,719
If you think his name alone makes him
sound like a third-tier Bond villain,

62
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,680
wait until you hear
about his everything else.

63
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,280
Masters is a Peter Thielbacked,
self-described conservative nationalist.

64
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,400
And since Trump's endorsement, things
have started to surface about him,

65
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:50,560
like this audio from a podcast
that he appeared on back in April.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,319
We do have gun violence problem in
this country, and it's gang violence.

67
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,080
Right? It's gangs,
it's people in Chicago, St. Louis,

68
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,960
shooting each other.

69
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:04,319
Very often,
Black people, frankly.

70
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,800
Blaming Black people
for gun violence in America

71
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:11,240
is just outrageously,
un creatively racist.

72
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:14,000
But also, it's unsurprising
from someone who, and this is true,

73
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,040
was called an "immigration patriot"
by the white nationalist website VDARE,

74
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,439
which praised him,
saying he "checks all the right boxes".

75
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,959
And "he's an immigration patriot who
checks all the white supremacist boxes"

76
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,240
just isn't what you want to hear
about a man running for office.

77
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,120
You don't even want to hear it
in a "Sex and the City" voiceover.

78
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,079
"That night, Charlotte met Blake,

79
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,040
who was an immigration patriot
who checked all the boxes.

80
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,759
I couldn't help but wonder, were we
just searching for our white knight?"

81
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,040
Masters also embraces
a national abortion ban,

82
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,079
has questioned whether January 6th
was set up by the FBI,

83
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,680
and then there is this interview,

84
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:52,000
in which he chooses the exact
wrong answer to the softball question,

85
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,639
"Who's a subversive thinker
who's underrated?"

86
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,160
- Subversive thinker that's underrated?
- Yeah.

87
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,920
I'll probably get in trouble
for saying this.

88
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,319
I'd say, how about,
like, Theodore Kaczynski?

89
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,879
Good one actually, yeah.

90
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,519
Probably not great to be talking about
the Unabomber while campaigning.

91
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah, probably not!
I'm sorry, Theodore Kaczynski?

92
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,680
What are you,
his mom when he's in trouble?

93
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,560
"Theodore John Kaczynski,
have you been sending mail bombs

94
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,360
to airlines and universities
around the country

95
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:31,319
from a remote cabin
in the Montana wilderness?

96
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:34,680
You are so grounded, mister!
Naughty Theodore!"

97
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,319
Masters insists that he doesn't endorse
the bomb aspect of the Unabomber,

98
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:42,399
which to be fair, was a pretty
key part of his whole deal.

99
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,160
But Jim Lamon has now produced
an attack ad featuring that,

100
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,279
and many other terrible things
that Masters has said,

101
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,480
and his pushback to it
was full of even more red flags.

102
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,120
As my competitors self-destruct,
these attacks are going to increase.

103
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,480
Right, they'll interview
my classmates from middle school.

104
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,439
They'll pore over whatever
I may have written as a teenager,

105
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,160
try to twist it all out of proportion.

106
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,519
But I'm not going to get sucked into
that kind of petty, dirty politics.

107
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,759
Holy shit. "They will pore over
what I may have written as a teenager"

108
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,319
is just not a normal thing
to worry about.

109
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,160
It's like saying, "My petty opponents
will go from dog pound to dog pound,

110
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,480
asking the staff what I may have
done with all those stray dogs.

111
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,600
Classic petty, dirty politics."
Except no! It isn't, Blake!

112
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,879
It's weird, specific politics that
we now need to know a lot more about.

113
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,720
This primary
is very much up in the air.

114
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,160
And we don't know whether
it'll go to Nunchucks McGee,

115
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,160
the world's most pathetic cowboy,

116
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,800
or a guy who liked the Unabomber's
earlier, funnier stuff.

117
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,040
What we do know is that things
are going to intensify in Arizona,

118
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,240
that these results could well shift
the balance of power in the Senate,

119
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,279
and that, crucially,
someone probably needs

120
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,360
to interview Blake Masters' middle
school classmates as soon as possible.

121
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
And now, this!

122
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,519
And Now…

123
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,040
Sean Hannity's Favorite Joke.

124
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,199
To coin a phrase, was a total Schiff
show, if you know what I mean.

125
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,319
We call it the 2020 DNC
Adam Schiff Show.

126
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,680
Capitol Hill is now descended
into a total Adam Schiff show.

127
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,240
Adam Schiff show, as I call it.

128
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,000
I call it an Adam Schiff show.
This latest Schiff show.

129
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,199
Another Schiff show.
Schiff show.

130
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,000
Moscow doesn't give
a Adam Schiff about sanctions.

131
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:25,759
And they're full of, you know what,
Adam Schiff.

132
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:28,600
And then you could stop speaking
out of your Adam Schiff-hole.

133
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,240
You can't make this Adam Schiff up.

134
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,240
He bombed the living Adam Schiff
out of ISIS.

135
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:38,399
Let me put it a delicate way.
They're Adam Schiff-ing in their pants.

136
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,079
That's actually total bull-Schiff.
Bull-Schiff.

137
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,439
It's total B.S. or total B. Schiff.
Adam Schiff.

138
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:50,519
Spotify is in deep trouble,
or Adam Schiff, as I call it.

139
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,199
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns the internet,

140
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:01,439
a world-changing resource
that was initially sold to us like this.

141
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,439
We installed the internet on our
computer just a short time ago,

142
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,240
and I haven't been able
to get the kids off it ever since.

143
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,360
Not only do they play the typical
computer games that all the kids enjoy,

144
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,120
but their curiosity
for learning has skyrocketed.

145
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,560
Peter is constantly
quoting sports statistics,

146
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,639
and he can tell you the best
surfing spots around the globe.

147
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:23,319
Not to mention the improvement
in Peter's grades, and Dasha's, too.

148
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:28,639
Okay, first, Peter was not checking
surfing spots or sports statistics.

149
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,720
Peter was masturbating.
That is what Peter was doing.

150
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,080
But also, spare a thought for Dasha
there, who gets "also good grades."

151
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,919
I hope you grew up to be
an early investor in cell phones,

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,879
made millions of dollars, and never
spoke to your weird family ever again.

153
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,080
We're going to talk about the fact
that our experiences on the internet

154
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,000
are now dominated
by a very small handful of companies,

155
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,600
who are getting pretty used
to throwing their weight around.

156
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,320
In 2020, the House Judiciary
Subcommittee on Antitrust

157
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,919
released a massive 450-page report

158
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,879
detailing anticompetitive conduct
by Apple, Amazon, Facebook,

159
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,720
and Alphabet,
that's the parent company of Google.

160
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,919
And the findings
couldn't have been clearer.

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,879
"Each platform serves as a gatekeeper
over a key channel of distribution,"

162
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,039
allowing these giants to pick "winners
and losers throughout our economy."

163
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,720
And I know, for some,
that's part of the appeal.

164
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,320
Apple's the empire of the smartphone
with all its attendant services.

165
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,200
Facebook's the repository
of your identity.

166
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:24,919
Amazon's the online world
backed by cloud infrastructure.

167
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,480
And Alphabet
is all things search.

168
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,960
These companies have created
products that we can't live without.

169
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:33,279
They are gargantuan businesses
that are, for the most part,

170
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,919
loved and respected by the most
important people, their customers.

171
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,559
Are they monopolists?
I honestly don't care. I don't!

172
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:43,039
Wake me up when someone
else can do it better!

173
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:45,600
Okay, so,
there's a few problems with that.

174
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:49,279
In order to be woken up, at some
point you do need to go to sleep,

175
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:52,480
something that I feel Jim Cramer,
a man who constantly exudes

176
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,559
big "running late
to my child's thing" energy,

177
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,240
hasn't done in the last decade.

178
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,799
But second, a big thing these
companies are accused of doing

179
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:02,440
is suppressing
their competition so completely

180
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,919
that we'd never actually know
if someone else could do it better

181
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,559
because they'll never
get a fair chance to try.

182
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,279
That is the problem here.

183
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:12,960
It's not that tech companies are
inherently bad because they are big,

184
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:15,279
it's that they're engaging
in anticompetitive behavior.

185
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,519
And here's where, unusually,
I might have some good news.

186
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,120
Because there are two bills
before Congress right now,

187
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,759
with bipartisan support,

188
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,639
that could curtail at least
some of big tech's excesses.

189
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,759
But for reasons
that we will get into later,

190
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,080
if they don't pass in the next month,
they're not likely to pass at all.

191
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:35,200
So, tonight,
let's talk about tech monopolies,

192
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,919
the hidden harm that they can do,
and how best to address that.

193
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,279
And let's start
with a tiny bit of history.

194
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,720
In the past, the U.S. has taken strong
action to break up harmful monopolies.

195
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:47,600
In the early 20th century,
we broke up Standard Oil.

196
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,360
And as recently as 40 years ago,

197
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,679
the government took action
against who else but AT&T,

198
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:56,200
our business daddy who left
for cigarettes and never came home.

199
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:00,279
They were actually "the largest
firm on the planet" back then,

200
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,120
and broadly well-respected
and considered good.

201
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,639
Which is to say, unrecognizable
from the AT&T of today.

202
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,120
But crucially,
that popularity may well have been

203
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,200
because people had no alternatives,

204
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,879
you had to rent your phone
from AT&T,

205
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,000
and they were in charge of both
local and long-distance services,

206
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,440
which, as we now know,
were wildly overpriced.

207
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,080
And when MCI,
a much smaller company,

208
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,039
tried to offer long distance
phone service at a lower rate,

209
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,240
AT&T was not having it.

210
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,000
MCI, which charges
up to 50 percent less than Bell,

211
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,840
argued that AT&T
tried to put it out of business

212
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,039
by refusing to provide equipment
needed for long-distance transmission.

213
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,639
A key exhibit: AT&T's own notes
of a 1972 Florida meeting

214
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,159
by company executives
in which one said,

215
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,399
"Let's choke them off
before they get started".

216
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,360
Obviously, fuck AT&T
now and forever.

217
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,039
But is that what that said?

218
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,399
'Cause the only bits of squiggle
that I can decode there are the words,

219
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,279
"Dangerous to Samanthas,"
a dollar sign,

220
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,200
something that weirdly
might be "Covid,"

221
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:07,879
and then there is something that's
no question, capital B, "Balls."

222
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,279
The DOJ then actually
filed an antitrust lawsuit,

223
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,480
which AT&T fought vigorously
for a decade.

224
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,000
And when, in 1984, it was "formally
broken up by the government,"

225
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,879
AT&T's chairman
warned the public

226
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,600
that we would come to regret
what had just happened.

227
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,679
I've had the conviction

228
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,440
and taken the position
in more than one forum

229
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:31,879
that the country
in the long run will be sorry.

230
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:38,159
I find it difficult to believe that
things will work as well in the future

231
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,679
as they have worked in the past.

232
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,120
But he was wrong.
Things actually worked better.

233
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,720
Because it turns out, ending a monopoly
is almost always a good thing,

234
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,320
whether it's AT&T or Standard Oil
or literally any game of Monopoly.

235
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,559
We didn't know it at the time,

236
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,039
but AT&T's dominance
was seriously holding back innovation.

237
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,840
But as soon as it wasn't controlling
the phone lines

238
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,879
and what you could attach
to its network,

239
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,879
many new products
started proliferating,

240
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,080
from the answering machine
to the modem.

241
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,679
The breakup of AT&T

242
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,279
was actually a key step
in producing the internet revolution,

243
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,399
giving us the web
as we now know it,

244
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,120
and Peter the ability to look up
sports stats, surfing spots,

245
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,600
and what we all know
he was really doing there.

246
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,200
The point is, when harmful monopolies
end, innovation flourishes.

247
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,080
And I want you
to bear that in mind

248
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:30,519
as we talk about the monopolies
of today, tech companies.

249
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,159
And tonight,
we're going to focus

250
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,320
on just one way that they
use their monopoly power,

251
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,519
something called self preferencing.

252
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,679
It's when companies unfairly favor
their products on their own platforms,

253
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:44,279
which have become so big that most
of us have no choice but to use them.

254
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,559
This is a particularly big problem
with these three companies,

255
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,320
and we're going to start with Apple.

256
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,679
Specifically, its App Store,
which is, basically,

257
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:54,440
the only place to download
software for your iPhone.

258
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:57,720
Which is already a little bit weird
when you think about it, right?

259
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,399
You can download any software
you like to your desktop computer,

260
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,919
but if you have an iPhone,

261
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,080
Apple has set it up so that its
App Store is the only game in town.

262
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:10,120
And Apple has been accused
of unfairly pushing its own apps

263
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,919
to the top of search results.

264
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,480
The company denies doing this,
but the Wall Street Journal found

265
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:17,799
Apple apps that generate revenue
through subscriptions or sales,

266
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:21,759
like music or books, showed up
first in 95 percent of searches

267
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,240
related to those apps.

268
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,320
But regardless, perhaps more important
is the stranglehold

269
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,240
that Apple has on developers who want
to get their apps onto your phone.

270
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,600
Because they are required
to use Apple's payment processor,

271
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,879
which takes a huge piece
of every dollar

272
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,440
that customers spend on those apps
and any digital purchases within them.

273
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:46,240
Apple takes a 30% commission
on sales of apps and in-app purchases.

274
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:50,799
So, if an app costs 4.99 upfront,
Apple collects $1.50.

275
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,159
Same goes for if you use an app to buy
digital goods, like virtual weapons,

276
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,200
or sign up for a subscription
to a monthly service.

277
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,000
It's true.
And that was pretty shocking to me.

278
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,399
It means that every time someone
spent money on the Jeremy Renner app,

279
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,159
something real people actually did,
to boost their posts about him

280
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,720
so they could hashtag
Be Seen by Jeremy Rennerm

281
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,679
again something humans wanted,

282
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:16,559
an amounts ranging from 1.99
to nearly 100 actual dollars,

283
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,200
Apple got a cut of that.

284
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:20,279
And that is blood money
right there.

285
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:24,000
Apple makes literally
billions and billions every year,

286
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,000
just on commissions
on App Store purchases.

287
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,039
And some app developers
have tried to find ways around this.

288
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,159
Tinder, for instance,
charges a higher price

289
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,600
if you subscribe through the app
than if you do it on their website.

290
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,840
If you open Netflix on your iPhone
and you don't have an account,

291
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:41,240
you get a message reading,
"Trying to join Netflix?

292
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,279
You can't sign up for Netflix
in the app. We know it's a hassle.

293
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,679
After you're a member,
you can start watching in the app."

294
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,519
And you can see
why Netflix would do that.

295
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,080
It doesn't want to lose a third
of its subscription revenue to Apple.

296
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,960
Because it needs that money to promote
its Netflix Pride Month collection!

297
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:01,840
Which is absolutely great.
Scroll by the dozen standup specials

298
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,080
mocking the trans community
and it's right there!

299
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:06,200
Shine with pride, guys!

300
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,799
And while Apple will say
that it's lowered its commissions

301
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:13,480
for certain small app developers,
and now even allows some apps

302
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:16,919
to link to an external website
and bypass commissions,

303
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,080
a key reason that happened is that
they were put under extreme pressure

304
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:23,799
from lawsuits
and from regulators overseas.

305
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:27,200
And if you are thinking, "Apple
is not the only game in town, right?"

306
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,559
What about Google's app store?"

307
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,639
They charge similarly
high commissions to developers.

308
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,440
And the fact is,
"over 99 percent of smartphones"

309
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,960
"are part of either Google's
or Apple's app ecosystem."

310
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,399
Let's actually talk a bit
about Google now.

311
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,879
Because their app store is clearly
only a small part of their story.

312
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,720
As I'm sure you know, they
absolutely dominate online searches.

313
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,440
Last year, Google conducted 90%
of the world's internet searches.

314
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,480
When billions of people
asked trillions of questions,

315
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,120
it was Google
that provided the answers,

316
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,159
using computer algorithms
known only to Google.

317
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:06,960
They have this phrase they use,
"Competition is just a click away."

318
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,079
They have no competition.

319
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,599
Bing, their competition,
has 2 percent of the market.

320
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:15,839
They have 90 percent.

321
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,000
Exactly.

322
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:21,000
People use Google to the extent that
"googling" something is now a verb.

323
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:24,000
You can't say that
for any other search engine.

324
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,039
No one has ever said
"I'm going to Bing it,"

325
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,000
except for maybe Bing Crosby
announcing he's about to masturbate.

326
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,119
But that's it.

327
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:36,160
And Google has exploited
their market dominance in subtle ways,

328
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,400
having to do with the search results
that it shows you.

329
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,640
Because it used to be,
when you googled something,

330
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,519
you got a page
that looked like this,

331
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:45,119
a series of blue links
to various pages across the internet

332
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,319
that Google's algorithm had determined
to be the most relevant.

333
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,200
And that was the company's goal
at the time.

334
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,519
As its co-founder Larry Page
said in 2004,

335
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:56,640
"Most portals show their own content
above content elsewhere on the web.

336
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,839
We feel that's a conflict of interest.

337
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,640
We want to get you out of Google and
to the right place as fast as possible."

338
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,640
But when you search
for something today,

339
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,240
you get a lot of Google content
before anything else appears.

340
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,839
The Markup found Google

341
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,559
devotes 41 percent of the first page
of its results on mobile devices

342
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,119
to its own properties,
and what it calls direct answers.

343
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,799
Meaning that "a user would have
to scroll nearly halfway down the page

344
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,839
before reaching the first organic
result in that search."

345
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,920
Now, Google
disputes their methodology,

346
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,920
but think about what it is like
when you search for something.

347
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,880
Let's say you want to look
up dolphins.

348
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,519
So, you google, "dolphin animal,"
and you get this.

349
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:38,599
A bunch of pictures of dolphins
on Google Images.

350
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,480
A bunch of buttons up
top like "sounds"

351
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,559
that mostly lead you
to videos on YouTube,

352
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,519
also owned by Google,
by the way,

353
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:47,559
a section on the right side that's mostly
links to related Google searches,

354
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,279
like "orca" or "Amazon river dolphin"
and a box of answers to questions

355
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:53,359
that people have asked
about dolphins,

356
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,880
like "What are five interesting facts
about dolphins?"

357
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,359
or "Is dolphin a friendly animal?",
"Can a dolphin love you?"

358
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:02,279
And while you've never even thought
of that as a possibility,

359
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:05,039
suddenly, you're curious,
so, you click on it, and it says

360
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,079
"dolphins have also shown loving
emotions towards humans."

361
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,319
And your heart
kind of flutters for a moment

362
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,440
because who knew that there was room
in a dolphin's heart for love?

363
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,359
Maybe there is room in one for you?

364
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,880
And then you see more questions
like "Do dolphins protect humans?"

365
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,599
Which they must, right? After all,
we now learned, they can love us.

366
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,920
But the answer is "there just isn't
any reliable evidence that it's true."

367
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,680
And what the fuck does that mean?

368
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:26,319
That they're willing to love,
but not protect us?

369
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,960
They're just going to throw
our love away?

370
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:30,440
And as the feeling of betrayal
starts to creep in,

371
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:33,400
you see that others have searched
"Are dolphins evil?"

372
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,920
And the answer is, "Dolphins
have a huge capacity for evil."

373
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,559
Which, of course they do.
They're monsters with no understanding

374
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,039
that you might've opened up to them
for the first time in a long time,

375
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:44,200
and they'd abandon you
like you're nothing?

376
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:46,559
And then you see
"What do dolphins think of humans?"

377
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,759
And you can barely even breathe
as you open this one,

378
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:51,200
but you know the truth
before it even appears:

379
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:55,039
"dolphins are essentially bribed
with fish to interact with humans."

380
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:57,880
Even though you're hurt, at least
you can accept that it's not you,

381
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,559
it was never you,
it was the fucking dolphin!

382
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,559
And the point is, throughout
that whole emotional rollercoaster,

383
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,599
you never even left Google.

384
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,400
In fact, one analysis found
that two-thirds of searches on Google

385
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,359
ended without ever clicking
to another web property.

386
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,640
Information that Google
feeds you in searches like that

387
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,920
may have been
"copied from other sources,

388
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,119
sometimes without their knowledge
or consent."

389
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,559
And if you're thinking, "It's free
information. Why does it matter

390
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,640
if I read it on Google or on the site
that they took it from?"

391
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,279
Site traffic is one of the major tools
that many websites,

392
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,200
especially free ones,
use to sell ad space,

393
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:36,559
so taking away visitors to their site

394
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,640
is, essentially,
taking money out of their pocket.

395
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,200
And when Yelp explicitly
refused to have their data scraped,

396
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,519
Google told them the only way to have
their site's content removed

397
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:50,240
was for it to be "removed from
Google's general results entirely."

398
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:54,799
And as the CEO of Yelp explains,
that is basically a death sentence.

399
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,640
- How important is that first page?
- It's the first few links on the page.

400
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:05,839
Is the majority of where user attention
goes, where the traffic flows.

401
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:09,079
If you're not at the top of the page
or at the bottom of the first page,

402
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,279
or on the second page,
that's going to affect your business?

403
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:15,400
If you're on the second page,
forget it, you're not a real business.

404
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,279
Exactly.

405
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,920
And putting the merits of Yelp aside,
Google's algorithm shouldn't determine

406
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,400
whether or not
someone's business is real.

407
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,039
Frankly, that distinction
should only be withheld

408
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:29,559
if someone's business includes
the words "Instagram influencer."

409
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,839
Because that is not a job, you're
not a business, you're just attractive,

410
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,119
independently wealthy,
and it's sunny outside.

411
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,000
That is all that is happening there.

412
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:39,720
And before Jim Cramer says,
"Who cares?

413
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,359
Build a better product
and you'll land on the front page,"

414
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:47,000
the top results Google feeds you
may not be the best ones.

415
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,640
Take Google Flights.

416
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,599
It used to be that if you googled
"NYC to Boise,"

417
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,160
your top results
would be links to sites like these.

418
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,720
But now, you'll almost always
get this Google Flights widget

419
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:59,160
at the top of the page,

420
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,319
already set up, so that you can stay
on Google and find a flight,

421
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,079
without clicking anywhere else.

422
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,039
And while you, personally,
might scroll down past that,

423
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:10,480
many don't,
and the industry has felt this.

424
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,119
As one travel analyst wrote,

425
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,119
"The fact that Google is leveraging
its dominance as a search engine

426
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,920
into taking market share
away from travel competitors

427
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,079
is no longer even debatable."

428
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,640
And Google might say that it's
at the top because it is the best.

429
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,319
But The Markup found that Google
flights did not always display

430
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,559
the cheapest fares
or all available flights.

431
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,559
So, I guess that does kind of explain
why Google Flights' banner image

432
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,799
is a woman
and a child hiking somewhere

433
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,039
while pointing at an airplane
that they are not on,

434
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,680
seemingly saying, "What the fuck?
There are flights here?

435
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,640
Google told us our best option
was to walk to Denver!"

436
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,880
Google, like Apple, will quibble with
a lot of what I have just told you.

437
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,480
They will tell you they send billions
of clicks outside of Google every day,

438
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:58,279
and that they don't preference
Google Flights in searches,

439
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:01,119
which, okay, Google.

440
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,519
They will also tell you that Yelp
and other companies

441
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:07,319
now have tools to specify
what information gets scraped,

442
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,400
although that only happened
after serious pressure from the FTC.

443
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,400
And if you're noticing
a theme here,

444
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,160
that these companies do the right thing
when they're pushed up against the wall

445
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,279
that's a little bit the point.

446
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:22,559
But arguably the company
most guilty of self-preferencing

447
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,799
is Amazon, founded, of course, by a man
rich enough to buy absolutely anything,

448
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
including, seemingly,
the rights to Pitbull's identity.

449
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,880
Amazon reportedly controls

450
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,680
65 to 70 percent of all U.S.
online marketplace sales.

451
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:40,759
It hosts about 2.3 million
active third-party sellers

452
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:42,279
from all around the world.

453
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:45,160
And to those sellers, like this man,
who sold sporting goods,

454
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,359
it is close to the only game in town.

455
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,160
You've got to be on Amazon.

456
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,519
You have to be there
because that's where everyone is.

457
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,680
That 100 million Prime subscribers.

458
00:23:56,119 --> 00:24:00,839
Amazon executives have told us
that there are many options out there.

459
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,559
There is Walmart, there is Alibaba,
as a seller, you've got options.

460
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,759
I've heard that response from Amazon
executives before and we did that.

461
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,319
We listed all of our products
on every other online marketplace.

462
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:19,960
All of the others
that were non-Amazon combined

463
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,200
did about 10 percent
of what we were doing on Amazon.

464
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,480
Exactly. Amazon basically
is the marketplace.

465
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,119
It's essentially the only place
to sell anything on the internet,

466
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,920
unless, that is, you're looking
to offload some human teeth.

467
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,920
Because then,
it's Craigslist all the way, baby.

468
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,799
And for a third-party seller,

469
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:41,400
the most important thing in the world
is something called the "buy box."

470
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,480
It's that little box that shows up
on any Amazon product page,

471
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,240
where you can instantly click to buy.

472
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,519
So, when we searched
for Duracell AAA batteries,

473
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:51,039
we got this page, and here
is the buy box, right here,

474
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:54,079
where with just one click,
we could buy a pack for $14.

475
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,880
And you might assume
that that is the best deal,

476
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,359
but if you click
on this little box below,

477
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,640
you can see multiple other sellers
who are offering the same product,

478
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,319
many at a lower price.

479
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,200
The problem is,
most people aren't going to see that

480
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:11,319
because an estimated 80% of Amazon
sales go through that first buy box,

481
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,839
and it's even more
for mobile purchases.

482
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,559
Because, if we've learned
anything so far tonight,

483
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,880
it's that nobody ever,
ever wants to scroll down.

484
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,200
So, only one seller
gets to be in that box.

485
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:27,160
And nobody except Amazon knows
how its algorithm picks the winner.

486
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,960
But it sure seems
to consistently favor Amazon,

487
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:33,319
with one analysis finding that the
company chose itself for the buy box

488
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,319
for about 40 percent of products,

489
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,400
while the next highest seller got in
just half of 1% of popular products.

490
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,480
And even when the buy box
did go to a third-party seller,

491
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:48,240
nine out of 10 times, it went to those
that used Amazon's shipping service,

492
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:50,039
"Fulfilled by Amazon."

493
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:54,079
Basically, it is Amazon's playground,
they make the rules,

494
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,319
and they do seem to win
a lot of the time.

495
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,920
And as this expert points out,

496
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,759
if they're competing with you,
you're basically dead.

497
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:04,559
Third-party sellers have told me
that once they see that Amazon

498
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,519
is selling the same good
that they're selling,

499
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,079
they liquidate their inventory.

500
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,079
They know it's impossible to compete
against Amazon on Amazon's platform.

501
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:17,000
Of course. Think about it, of course,
it is. You don't stand a chance.

502
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:20,279
Amazon is to retailers
what dolphins are to the human heart,

503
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:25,000
if they take an interest in you,
you're going to wind up devastated.

504
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,160
Fuck you, Flipper!

505
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,000
Amazon isn't just a marketplace
or indeed a shipping company,

506
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:36,000
it's also started coming up
with its own products now.

507
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,319
'Cause it currently has "approximately
158,000 private-label products,

508
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,279
across 45 in-house brands."

509
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:46,039
It has been accused of preferencing
them over its competitors,

510
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:48,519
or even worse,
making clear knockoffs

511
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:51,039
of products that have been
successfully sold on its website.

512
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:53,599
Take a small company
called Peak Design.

513
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,279
It made this camera bag, and when
it noticed a suspiciously similar bag

514
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:02,359
being sold by Amazon, it made this
pretty decent snarky video in response.

515
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,880
This is the Everyday Sling
by Peak Design.

516
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:09,720
And this is the Everyday Sling
by Amazon Basics.

517
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,160
It looks suspiciously
like the Peak Design Everyday Sling,

518
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,799
but you don't have to pay for all
those needless bells and whistles

519
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,000
like years of research
and development,

520
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:22,519
recycled Bluesignapproved materials,
a lifetime warranty,

521
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:26,039
fairly paid factory workers,
and total carbon neutrality.

522
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:28,319
Instead, you just get a bag

523
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:32,200
designed by the crack team
at the Amazon Basics department.

524
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:37,680
And it does sure seem that Amazon
is putting out a cheap copy

525
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:40,039
with essentially
the same name and design.

526
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:43,279
And it's pretty weird that one of the
biggest companies in the world

527
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:46,359
seems to be using the same strategy
as knock-off DVDs

528
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,240
designed to confuse parents.

529
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:50,240
"Hey kids, we got you the movies
that you asked for:

530
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:53,400
"Ratatoing," "Transmorphers,"
and "Chop Kick Panda!"

531
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,160
Why are you crying?
It's what you wanted!"

532
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,039
And Amazon has a huge advantage
over its competitors,

533
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:02,119
because it runs the marketplace,

534
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,720
and it has access
to all the independent seller data,

535
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,680
like, I don't know, hypothetically,
what bag is proving popular.

536
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:12,279
Amazon denies that they preference
themselves, their own products,

537
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:15,240
or sellers that pay
for their logistics services.

538
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:18,599
And they also deny ripping
off products based on internal data,

539
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:23,240
though when Jeff Bezos was asked
about that, his answer wasn't great.

540
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,880
Let me ask you, Mr. Bezos,
does Amazon ever access

541
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,920
and use third-party seller data
when making business decisions?

542
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:35,559
- And just a yes or no will suffice.
- I can't answer yes or no.

543
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,160
What I can tell you is we have a policy
against using seller-specific data

544
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,279
to aid our private label business.

545
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:47,119
But I can't guarantee you that
that policy has never been violated.

546
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,359
"We have a policy but I can't guarantee
you it hasn't been violated"

547
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,839
has gotta be one of the more
incriminating ways to answer.

548
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,039
It's right up there with answering,

549
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:00,519
"Did you break the law,"
with, "Which law?"

550
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:04,160
It is pretty clear,
self-preferencing stifles competition,

551
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,559
hurts small business,

552
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,359
and often results in serving consumers
an inferior product.

553
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,279
So, what can we do here?

554
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:13,240
That brings me back to the good news
that I mentioned earlier.

555
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:16,079
Because these two bills
are currently before Congress

556
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,119
and would address some of the
problems that you've seen tonight.

557
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,960
Among other things, they'd stop massive
companies that operate app stores,

558
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:24,480
like Apple and Google,
from requiring developers

559
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,960
use the company's
own in-app payment processor,

560
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,319
and they'd "ban advantaging
a platform's own products,

561
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,200
services, or lines of business
over those of a rival."

562
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,440
And unsurprisingly, tech companies
are fighting these bills hard,

563
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:41,079
making basically the same arguments
that AT&T made 40 years ago,

564
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,480
that if you tamper with them,

565
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,799
things just won't work as well
in the future as they did in the past.

566
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,799
Although this time they have trade
groups running ridiculous ads like this.

567
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,200
Washington is full of problems,
not solutions.

568
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,319
Every time they get involved
in a new area of our lives,

569
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,440
they seem to make things worse.

570
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,039
And now, politicians
are boasting about a plan

571
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:05,240
to control my devices
and how I use them?

572
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,680
Their silly ideas could ruin
some of the services I rely on.

573
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,079
If I need directions,

574
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,359
I simply click one button and it gets
me straight to where I need to go.

575
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,440
In their search
for popularity and power,

576
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:21,319
D.C. doesn't care whether they mess
up what I need from the internet.

577
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,319
My message to Washington:
focus on fixing America's real problems

578
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,279
and leave my phone alone.

579
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,759
What is going on
with that unsettling man?

580
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,000
"Focus on America's real problems,
like me, and whatever my deal is.

581
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:43,319
Because what is going on with me?
What's that thing in my truck?

582
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,200
Is it a trashcan taped to a desk?

583
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,400
A Jabba the Hutt barge
taped to a chimney?

584
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,599
Also, what did I just do to it,
and why?

585
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,079
My broader point seems to be
that I'd like government

586
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,480
to pay less attention to whatever
weird shit that I'm definitely up to.

587
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:59,599
To leave my phone and whatever
incriminating shit is on there alone,

588
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,720
or I will lunge right at you,
Washington!"

589
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,480
These companies
have pushed some wild arguments,

590
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,279
from claiming the bills
will help China,

591
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:12,160
to saying they'll somehow
hurt people of color.

592
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,880
And we don't have time
to go through every bullshit boogeyman

593
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,759
that they have come up with,
but none of them really stand up,

594
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:19,960
and some
have fallen apart spectacularly.

595
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,880
Apple, for instance,
claims that they have to have

596
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,519
exclusive control of the apps
you can download,

597
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:29,319
otherwise, it would "expose users
to serious security risks."

598
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,240
Ignoring the fact that these bills
have explicit carve outs for that,

599
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:37,160
if Apple can prove
that those risks genuinely exist.

600
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,559
Now, as for Amazon and Google,
they've been arguing

601
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,079
that small businesses
would be harmed by these bills,

602
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,039
funding lobbying groups like this
one, the Connected Commerce Council,

603
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:48,759
which supposedly represents
5,000 small businesses

604
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:50,920
who all oppose antitrust regulation.

605
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,400
But when Politico reached out
to its members,

606
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,720
nearly all of the businesses
that it contacted

607
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:59,279
said they'd never heard
of the Connected Commerce Council.

608
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:03,799
And I do get why Amazon, in particular,
wouldn't have filled them in about it,

609
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,599
because when it asked its third party
sellers to oppose these bills,

610
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,000
one of them wrote back,

611
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:11,519
"Any informed seller
is going to support

612
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:14,720
massive action taken against Amazon
in the antitrust arena.

613
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,920
We are not morons and know
how to read and think for ourselves."

614
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,599
Which is basically
a polite way of saying,

615
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,240
"Fuck you and the spaceship
that you rode in on."

616
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,319
The truth is, these bills are narrow,
arguably, too narrow.

617
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,400
But that is probably why they do have
broad bipartisan support.

618
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,720
Both Bernie Sanders and Josh
Hawley want to pass these bills.

619
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,960
That's basically the only
thing they have in common.

620
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:43,680
Apart from the fact that their smiles
are exclusively upper teeth, no lip.

621
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,000
So, why haven't the bills
moved forward?

622
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:50,119
Some believe that it doesn't help
that at least 17 members of Congress

623
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,359
currently have children
who work or have recently worked

624
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,200
for four of the biggest tech companies,
including, crucially,

625
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:57,880
Chuck Schumer's daughters,

626
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,519
one of whom works
as a marketing manager at Meta

627
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:04,279
and one of whom is a literal
registered lobbyist for Amazon.

628
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:07,519
And the reason that is interesting
is because Chuck Schumer

629
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:10,440
is the person who needs
to call these bills to a vote.

630
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,039
And while he has certainly
said he will do that,

631
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:15,119
he also hasn't done it yet,

632
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,640
and if he doesn't do it before
Congress leaves for its August recess,

633
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,279
the bills are probably
dead, because in the fall,

634
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:24,160
everyone's going to have moved on
to focusing on the midterm elections,

635
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,880
where, as we all know, the Democrats
will be absolutely annihilated.

636
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:33,079
So, we have a very small window
to actually do something about this.

637
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,599
And if any part of you is thinking,
"Things work fine for me right now."

638
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,680
It's just worth remembering,
people thought that things

639
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:43,599
worked fine with AT&T
before they were broken up,

640
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,440
because they literally
did not know what they were missing.

641
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:48,359
The problem with letting
a few companies

642
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,759
control whole sectors
of the economy

643
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:53,400
is that it limits
what is possible for startups

644
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,799
by, and if I may quote
AT&T's incoherent memo,

645
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:59,880
"Choking them before
they can even get started."

646
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,839
An innovative app, website or product
might never get off the ground,

647
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,480
because it could be surcharged
to death, buried in search results,

648
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,079
or ripped off completely.

649
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:12,840
These bills would crack the door
back open for innovation

650
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:17,039
and nudge the internet back toward what
it was supposed to be from the start:

651
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,639
a revolutionary tool that expands
global access to information,

652
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,559
and the absolute best place
to research surfing spots.

653
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,119
Get yours, Peter. Get yours!

654
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,880
Thank you so much for watching.
We'll see you next week. Good night!
