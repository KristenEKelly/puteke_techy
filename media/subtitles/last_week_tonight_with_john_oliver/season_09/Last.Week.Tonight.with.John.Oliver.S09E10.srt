LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,560
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight".

3
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,320
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

4
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,280
It has been a truly terrible week,

5
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,399
one that started
with two Jared Letos at the Met Gala

6
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,119
and then somehow
managed to get worse from there,

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,719
to the point that we're gonna do
something a little unusual right now

8
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,640
and that is two main stories.

9
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,320
Our first story tonight
concerns the fact that this week

10
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,640
saw the leak of a draft opinion
written by Justice Samuel Alito

11
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,799
that looks set to strike down
Roe v. Wade.

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,759
While the fate of Roe
may not have been a surprise,

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,400
the draft itself
was still a horror show.

14
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:09,120
The 67-page draft opinion is clear,
sharp and scornful,

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,640
declaring in its opening paragraphs
that Roe vs Wade "must be overruled"

16
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:18,200
and that the 1972 ruling "was
egregiously wrong from the start."

17
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,640
Alito dismisses the argument
in Roe versus Wade

18
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,079
that the right to choose abortion

19
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,280
is part of the constitutional guarantee
of liberty and privacy, insisting:

20
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:28,959
"The inescapable conclusion
is that the right to abortion

21
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,280
is not deeply rooted in the nation's
history and traditions."

22
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,560
Okay, but even if that were true,
which, by the way, fuck off,

23
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,599
the Framers probably left off
the specific right to abortion

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,480
because they couldn't anticipate it
being such a massive concern.

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,159
I don't know why these particular
individuals didn't have abortion

26
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:48,920
on the forefront of their minds,
there must have been some explanation.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,359
I can't quite place the exact reason,
but it is on the tip of my penis.

28
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,519
Alito wasn't just
deferring to the constitution,

29
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,959
he repeatedly cited some
other notable sources, too,

30
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,640
like 17th-century jurist
Sir Matthew Hale,

31
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,519
who once described abortion
as a "great crime".

32
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,599
But that is not all that Hale thought.

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,039
He argued that a husband cannot be
guilty of a rape committed upon his wife,

34
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,560
"sentenced two women
to death for witchcraft"

35
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,919
and argued young women
were the "ruin of families",

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,599
because they, and I quote:
"learn to be bold" and "talk loud".

37
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,759
While those beliefs might earn you

38
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,280
a Netflix comedy special called
"Trigger This",

39
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,520
they should disqualify you

40
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,479
as a scholarly reference
on the matter of reproductive rights.

41
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,000
This is not the first time that we've
talked about abortion on this show.

42
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,319
In fact, the first time
that we talked about it in depth,

43
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,879
we rewarded anyone for sticking
to the end of our story

44
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,360
with a video
of sloths playing in a bucket

45
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,599
that was almost criminally joyful.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,120
And if you're expecting
something similar this time,

47
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,599
I've got some bad news for you:
those sloths are dead now.

48
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,080
All of them, two from heroin.
It's time to grow up.

49
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,039
We need to be able to talk
about abortion like adults.

50
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,639
When, as now seems inevitable,
this ruling becomes official,

51
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:04,719
there will be immediate
and devastating consequences.

52
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,800
And it is worth taking some time
to talk about a few things:

53
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:10,840
what this ruling means,
how we got to this point

54
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,120
and where we go now.

55
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:15,879
And when it comes to what this means,
it's catastrophic.

56
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,120
It'll quickly trigger bans
on abortion in these 22 states.

57
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:24,319
And if you are still unaware of just
how ubiquitous a procedure this is,

58
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,400
an estimated "25 percent
of women have an abortion"

59
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,639
and six in 10 of them
are already parents.

60
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:32,919
Some who get abortions
are survivors of rape or incest,

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,400
others might need one for medical
reasons, but also, just to be clear,

62
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,639
some will be seeking an abortion
because they fucking want one

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,360
and this is very much
about them, too.

64
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:45,800
This a fight for people's right
to have control over their bodies.

65
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,599
It's about bodily autonomy.

66
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,560
The only time
it's okay to argue against that

67
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,159
is if the body in question
belongs to Elmo.

68
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,639
Because then, it is actually fine.
He literally cannot function

69
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,840
unless someone else
is arm-fucking him from below.

70
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,199
But anything beyond that example
is just not okay.

71
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,439
And some conservatives have argued
that the reaction this week

72
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,159
has been hysterical, that this
is returning the issue to the states

73
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,520
and that people
do still have a choice.

74
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,800
This is not an opinion that is going
to undo abortion in this country.

75
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,519
States may put
some more restrictions on it,

76
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,439
but people have the right to leave,
they can go live somewhere else

77
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,040
where it's more of a free-for-all and
they can do whatever they want.

78
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,319
Okay, first...
"Where it's more of a free-for-all?"

79
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,199
Let's just get one thing straight.
If you move to Delaware,

80
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,519
you're not in some bacchanalian,
buy-one-get-one-free abortion paradise.

81
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,319
You're just in Wilmington.

82
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:42,040
I just don't want anyone
to be disappointed when they visit.

83
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,560
But also, it's not about merely having
the right to go somewhere else.

84
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,040
It's about whether you have
the resources and ability to do that.

85
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,560
And many may not, with this
disproportionately affecting

86
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,319
those with disabilities, transgenders,
immigrants or people of color.

87
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,439
Even with just the existing laws
that have been recently passed,

88
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:03,439
abortions had become
increasingly difficult to get.

89
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,399
Watch as one woman in Texas

90
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,000
learned what getting an abortion
would entail for her,

91
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,560
after her state passed its so-called
"fetal heartbeat" law last year.

92
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,360
You're measuring at 6.1 weeks today,

93
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,759
but we do see fetal cardiac
activity on the ultrasound.

94
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,560
So, as of September 1st in Texas,
what that means

95
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,680
is that you are ineligible to have
an abortion in the state of Texas now.

96
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,920
Your next options
would be traveling out of state

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,680
to get the procedure done.

98
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,680
I didn't even know that I was pregnant.
I kind of just took a test.

99
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,800
I'm six weeks and one day pregnant.
I'm not ready to have another kid.

100
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:44,839
I have two other little ones
that I take care of by myself.

101
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,920
This kind of was very unexpected.

102
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,199
Other forms of birth control failed me
and now it looks like I'm jumping

103
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:01,079
through more hoops
in order to keep our lives going.

104
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,879
Six weeks and a day
and she can't get an abortion.

105
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,639
For most people, that is a period
that is two weeks late.

106
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,519
And your period could be two weeks
late for any number of reasons.

107
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,319
Maybe you're tired, or traveling,
or you had a change in diet or exercise,

108
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:19,360
or maybe you're dealing with the stress
of living in a misogynistic theocracy

109
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,160
run by five of the biggest weirdos
in the country,

110
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,439
including Justice Beer Pong here

111
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:29,360
and Justice My Wife Planned a Coup
And All I Got Was No Consequences.

112
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,639
In that woman's particular case,
she was able to take a loan

113
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,920
and drive all the way to Oklahoma
to get an abortion.

114
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,240
As awful as this sounds,
she was actually lucky there,

115
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,040
because now,
that is no longer possible.

116
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,639
This week, Oklahoma's governor signed
a Texas-style abortion ban into law.

117
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:51,879
Which is one of the worst things
that Oklahoma has ever produced,

118
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,120
as I'll remind you, it also
gave the world Dr. fucking Phil.

119
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:01,160
Given that half of those who have
abortions are below the poverty line,

120
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,360
with an additional
one-quarter very close to it,

121
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,839
many will be facing limited options.

122
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,160
One estimate is that
in the year after the ruling,

123
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,279
there will be roughly 75 000 people
who want but can't get abortions

124
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,199
and will give birth instead.

125
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,120
And inevitably,
some of those people will die,

126
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,920
because pregnancy
is a major medical event.

127
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:23,800
Those living in states with
the most restrictive abortion policies,

128
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,639
and thus the least access to them,

129
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,680
"were found to be more likely to die
while pregnant or shortly thereafter."

130
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,360
I know this is all extremely grim.

131
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,759
But it is now worth taking a moment
on exactly how we got to this point,

132
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:41,120
especially as some have been telling
a slightly incomplete story this week.

133
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,480
Listen to Chuck Schumer pointing
the finger of blame in one direction.

134
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,120
This isn't your grandfather's
Republican Party, America.

135
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,199
It's Donald Trump's
Republican Party.

136
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,319
Hold on, there. In what way is this not
your grandfather's Republican Party?

137
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:00,399
It has been advocating for
this exact outcome for decades now.

138
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,279
I would be willing to bet that
if your grandfather died in the '70s,

139
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,360
came back to life right now
and scanned the news,

140
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,279
the first thing he'd say
is that the current Republican Party

141
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,319
sounds exactly like the one
he remembers.

142
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,160
I take that back, the first thing
he'd say is: "Who's Elon Musk?"

143
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,680
To which you'd say: "He's a rich
asshole who wants to own Twitter."

144
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,040
To which he'd say: "What's Twitter?"
And you'd say:

145
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,800
"A massive public toilet that people
shit their bad opinions into,"

146
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:28,160
"but at least Cher is on there, too!"

147
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,319
To which he'd reply:
"You mean Sonny's wife?"

148
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,600
And you'd say: "Yeah!",
because you don't really have time

149
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,960
to fill him in on the divorce,
much less the accident,

150
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,000
to which he'd say:
"How's Sonny doing, by the way?"

151
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,159
Yeah, he's great! Very healthy!
To which he'd reply:

152
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,600
"Does he still have the mustache?"
And you'd say: "Yeah, you betcha!"

153
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,519
because you are way too deep into
the lie to admit to your grandpa

154
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,000
that Sonny Bono died
by skiing into a tree.

155
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,960
After all of that conversation,
he'd definitely look at you and say

156
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:57,960
that the current Republican Party
sounds like the one that he remembers.

157
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:02,720
Because it does. This is just
not a recent development at all.

158
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,200
Because while, yes,
Trump did pick one-third of this court,

159
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,200
including a seat for Gorsuch
that was stolen for him,

160
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,000
that was the result of decades of work
by anti-abortion forces.

161
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,200
Long before Trump ever even
considered running for office,

162
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:19,679
conservatives were openly announcing
their intention to overturn Roe.

163
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,919
In fact, the very day
the Roe decision was handed down,

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,639
the strategizing
against it had already begun.

165
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,000
Just watch this news report
from that day, featuring a lawyer

166
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,440
talking about a lawsuit that he was
supporting that could overturn Roe.

167
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,799
What about the child's right?
When you talk about the woman's right,

168
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,399
you're talking
about one-third of the rights involved.

169
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,360
The mother, the father and the child.
Somebody's morality, or lack of it,

170
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,639
is certainly imposed upon
the unborn children who are killed.

171
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:54,200
Women have one-third of the rights
involved. That is kind of perfect.

172
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:56,759
Because if there is one thing
that we love to do in America,

173
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,919
it's turn everyone who isn't a straight
white man into a fucking fraction.

174
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,519
That is something that truly is

175
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,759
"deeply rooted in the nation's
history and traditions."

176
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,320
But arguments like that are why some
Democrats, like Bella Abzug,

177
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,559
argued in the wake of the Roe decision
that Congress still needed

178
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:17,519
to quickly pass legislation
codifying the right to an abortion.

179
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,399
And she was absolutely right.
But, of course, they didn't do that.

180
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,519
Nor did they do it as the anti-abortion
movement kicked into high gear

181
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,440
in the late 1970s, with the support of
evangelical leaders like Jerry Falwell,

182
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:30,360
who helped elevate the abortion issue

183
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,600
as a way of motivating
conservative voters to the polls.

184
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,879
They didn't even do it
as anti-abortion legislators managed

185
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,360
to pass 1000 restrictions
into law at the state level.

186
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,200
Too many Democratic leaders
shied away from engaging in that fight,

187
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:49,120
or were squeamish
in their defense of abortion.

188
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,519
Bill Clinton, for instance, argued that
it should be "safe, legal and rare",

189
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,799
which "cast abortion as a regrettably
necessary evil,"

190
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,000
"not a cornerstone
of comprehensive health care."

191
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,360
While later, Barack Obama campaigned
on passing the Freedom of Choice Act,

192
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,240
enshrining the rights to abortion
into law,

193
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,000
when he was reminded of that promise
100 days into his presidency,

194
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,639
he wasted no time
distancing himself from it.

195
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,200
The Freedom of Choice Act
is not my highest legislative priority.

196
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,799
I believe that women
should have the right to choose.

197
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:29,080
But I think that the most important
thing we can do to tamp down

198
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:35,200
some of the anger
surrounding this issue

199
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:38,600
is to focus on those areas
that we can agree on.

200
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,720
Okay, except that's just ridiculous.

201
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:46,159
Partly because this is something
a majority of Americans do agree on.

202
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:49,759
Polls consistently show that around
two-thirds of Americans

203
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,440
support the Roe v. Wade decision,
two-thirds!

204
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,639
Presidents can't even get
an approval rating that high,

205
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,759
unless there are, like, two 9/11s.

206
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,639
It's called an 18/22. If we're honest,
it might actually be coming.

207
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,559
And that's sadly been emblematic
of Democrats' approach,

208
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,720
offering vague statements in support,

209
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:11,039
while abortion has been
specifically under attack.

210
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,679
Republicans have focused on this
issue with relentless determination.

211
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,679
Here is Jerry Falwell, right after
Alito was appointed to the court,

212
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,159
taking a victory lap following
a ruling that upheld the ban

213
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,799
on a specific abortion procedure.

214
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:28,679
That is the culmination, for me,
of about 35 years of work.

215
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:31,559
I don't think we have
five votes on Roe v. Wade.

216
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:34,440
I think we're probably
one or two votes short.

217
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,039
As we talked
that last week of his life,

218
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,559
Falwell seemed to recognize that
his battle to end all abortions

219
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,399
would have to be won by the next
generation of God's warriors.

220
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,440
My children are more likely to see
this victory won than I am.

221
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,039
I think we're 50 years away.
We've got to just stay with it,

222
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,879
and never give up.

223
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,639
Even the truly magnificent sight
of Jerry Falwell in a coffin

224
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,879
somehow still doesn't make that
go down any easier.

225
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:12,559
Falwell was actually pessimistic
in his prediction there.

226
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,360
They achieved that victory 35 years
ahead of his 50-year schedule.

227
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,159
That's not the only thing that
he was wrong about in that interview,

228
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,600
because he also said that he'd been
praying for another 20 years of life,

229
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,200
despite only having
about one week of it left.

230
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,960
So, I guess at the very least
we now know that God

231
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,519
didn't want to listen to any more
of Jerry Falwell's bullshit either.

232
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,559
It is important to know, conservatives
aren't remotely done here.

233
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,799
They've already embarked
on the next fight,

234
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,440
with Louisiana just this week
advancing legislation

235
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,399
that would allow prosecutors there
to charge those who get abortions,

236
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,519
or provide them, with homicide.

237
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:51,240
That bill, like anti-abortion
legislation in several other states,

238
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,399
even defines personhood as "beginning
from the moment of fertilization",

239
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,080
which "would criminalize in vitro
fertilization and birth control."

240
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,000
And all of this is happening,

241
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,679
even as other countries
are expanding reproductive rights.

242
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,480
Even Ireland is now more progressive
on abortion than some U.S. states.

243
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,919
If you are not up on your Irish history,
that was not always the case!

244
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:18,559
And that is as much
as I will weigh in on Irish history,

245
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,639
because I sound like this.

246
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,759
It's not just Ireland,
other predominantly Catholic countries,

247
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,559
like Argentina, Mexico and Colombia,
have also expanded abortion rights.

248
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,320
Just two months ago, Colombia
won a massive court victory there,

249
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,919
to huge celebrations.

250
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,639
This is historic.
It brings us such happiness.

251
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,200
Because little by little,
we are changing our history.

252
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,039
We finally succeeded in having them
allow us to decide over our bodies.

253
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,600
We fought for this for many years

254
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:56,159
and clandestine abortions
took the lives of so many women.

255
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:00,559
That is truly inspiring to watch,
and also, quick shoutout

256
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,720
to the individual who made a crocheted
ski mask with the letters "ACAB".

257
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:09,120
Let this be a lesson that you
absolutely don't want to fuck

258
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,039
with someone who has the patience,
attention to detail

259
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:17,559
and sustained anger to crochet their
resentment into a handmade garment.

260
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:20,960
That is stamina. That is someone
in the fight for the long haul.

261
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:25,080
So clearly, we in the States have
a lot of work to do right now,

262
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:27,559
both in the short
and the long term.

263
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:30,679
And let us start with those
in the most immediate danger:

264
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,279
people who need an abortion

265
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,720
in states where bans
are or are about to be in effect.

266
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:39,120
You still have options available to you
and one good way to find out

267
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,559
what they are is to go to the website
"I-need-an-A-dot-com".

268
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,759
It has lots of info, including
what is permitted where you live

269
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,120
and where you can find clinics
and appropriate resources.

270
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,279
If you're struggling financially,
one of those resources

271
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,279
might be an abortion fund,
which can help cover your expenses.

272
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,679
If you want to access or support
one of those funds, there are lots,

273
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:59,799
like The Brigid Alliance,
which helps abortion patients

274
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:02,320
who are traveling long distances
to reach their appointments,

275
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,120
and The Lilith
and Yellowhammer funds,

276
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,120
both of which help people
on the ground in impacted states.

277
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,720
These are just stopgap solutions
to deal with an immediate crisis.

278
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:14,519
Long-term, we need elected officials

279
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,879
to stop tiptoeing
around the issue of abortion

280
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,240
and take steps
to properly safeguard it.

281
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,519
Now, the dream version of this
would be a constitutional amendment

282
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,080
that'd support people's fundamental
rights to make personal decisions

283
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,480
about contraception, pregnancy,
marriage and family life.

284
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:34,039
Until then, we're going to need other
legislation at state and federal level.

285
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,519
And while we're at it,
we may now also need to shore up

286
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,000
all the other rights supposedly
guaranteed by Supreme Court rulings,

287
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,960
from voting rights to gay marriage,
because the fact is,

288
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,840
under the current Supreme Court,

289
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:48,240
your basic rights today
could become crimes tomorrow.

290
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:52,799
And there are actually some small
opportunities for you on the horizon.

291
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,440
In at least these four states,

292
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:57,120
abortion is going to be
on the ballot this year.

293
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,799
I know you would probably
rather eat shards of glass

294
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:03,159
than be told to vote one more time.

295
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,920
Especially if you've been keeping up
your end of the deal:

296
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,079
showing up to the polls and holding
your nose to vote for a candidate

297
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,599
you may not even like, while enduring
thousands of texts screaming:

298
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,319
"It is the most important election
of your lifetime,"

299
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,960
"donate 20 dollars
to the DNC right now."

300
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,279
And you didn't
text "stop 2 quit" once,

301
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,039
no matter how much you wanted to,

302
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:25,119
and you wanted to throw
your phone in the fucking river!

303
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,160
I also get why "just vote" is
an infuriatingly insufficient slogan,

304
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,680
when voting rights themselves
are under siege.

305
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:36,519
I cannot defend
the system we currently have.

306
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:40,200
But it is, unfortunately,
the one we've got right now.

307
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,799
So, electoral victories
are going to be critical here.

308
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,759
They also must be followed by
concrete actions by those that we elect.

309
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:50,240
Because Republicans,
if nothing else,

310
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,400
just grimly demonstrated what
committed action can actually achieve.

311
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,079
They never accepted Roe v. Wade
as final. They played the long game,

312
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,920
and not always fairly,
but they rallied their base

313
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,440
and relentlessly held
their party leaders accountable,

314
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:06,680
whether
they liked those leaders or not.

315
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,200
And then, crucially,
those leaders delivered for them,

316
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:12,559
because they understood that voting
is only meaningful

317
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,079
if the people who win actually do
what they fucking promise you.

318
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,880
Anti-choice advocates worked
really hard for a really long time

319
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:23,400
to ensure
that Roe would not be permanent.

320
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,880
But the thing is, its undoing
doesn't have to be, either.

321
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:29,559
This week, we have all been reminded

322
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,799
of what the most marginalized people
have known for years:

323
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,319
that freedoms are never guaranteed,
they are hard-won and easily lost.

324
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,279
Progress requires a consistent,
sustained struggle,

325
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:45,039
a willingness to disrupt everyday life

326
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,400
and actual courage from the people
that we choose to lead us.

327
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,039
In short, we are all going
to badly need to have the same anger

328
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:55,759
and the same willingness
for a long-haul fight

329
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:58,480
as the world's
most hardcore knitter.

330
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,519
And now, this.

331
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:06,359
Local News Shows Go Through
the Motions for "Star Wars" Day.

332
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,720
Good morning, San Diego.
I'm Lauren Phinney.

333
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:12,880
I'm Paul Rudy. Today is Wednesday.
Say it with me, Lauren.

334
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:19,960
Now say it with me.

335
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:22,359
May the fourth be with you.

336
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:28,200
Today is a celebration for the Star Wars
fans. It is May the fourth.

337
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:32,359
- We know how much you love today.
- Really look forward to it.

338
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,359
I don't mind the movies.
I don't like how they took this day

339
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,200
and made it this: "May the fourth
be with you", but I get it.

340
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,240
Does that do anything better for you?
No?

341
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:50,160
Turn it on. Now hit the button.

342
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,319
It's not working. Anyway,
should I be attacking these two?

343
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,559
From the other galaxy?
They're good guys?

344
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,079
- Harrison Ford, was that...
- Han Solo!

345
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,839
- That's the guy I was talking about.
- An hour later, we got it.

346
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,440
And I'd want to be him, 'cause
he was cool. He had the spaceship.

347
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:10,480
- And he got all the women.
- There you go.

348
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,079
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns the Philippines.

349
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,680
It's the country that gave us,
among other things,

350
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,440
Bruno Mars, Olivia Rodrigo,
and Jollibee,

351
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:24,480
the single greatest fast-food
mascot of all time.

352
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,279
He's a six-foot five bee
in a tuxedo top

353
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,920
that just wants to serve you
fried chicken and spaghetti.

354
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,039
What do we have that compares
to that? Terrifyingly Large Child?

355
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,640
Hamburger Joker? Hello Mister Police
I Gave You All The Clues? Please.

356
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,160
The winner here is clear.

357
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,799
We've discussed the Philippines
on this show before,

358
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,720
mostly thanks to their current leader
and self-proclaimed dictator,

359
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,599
Rodrigo Duterte, who has,
if nothing else, a way with words.

360
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:55,480
I wanted to call Pope
you son of a whore, go home!

361
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,200
Mr. Obama, you can go to hell.

362
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,200
Why do you have to, you know,
fuck with us, goddamnit?

363
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,119
Once again, I'll repeat it, fuck you.

364
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,240
That is a striking amount of swearing,
but you also cannot understate

365
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:14,400
how brazen it is
for the president of the Philippines,

366
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,720
a nation over 80 percent Catholic,
to call the Pope "a son of a whore".

367
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,680
That is a big deal.

368
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,759
Imagine if Joe Biden publicly told
Dolly Parton to go fuck herself.

369
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:28,759
Forget backlash, he'd be dragged from
the White House, and rightly so.

370
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,039
While Duterte's language
may have been shocking,

371
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:35,920
his actions have been far worse,
especially his war on drugs.

372
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's estimated that on his watch,
government officials or vigilantes

373
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,400
have killed up to 30 000 people,

374
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,400
in violence which even triggered
the International Criminal Court

375
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,799
to launch "an investigation into
possible crimes against humanity."

376
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,920
And Duterte has viciously
targeted his critics.

377
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,720
This senator, who launched
an investigation into his drug war,

378
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:56,559
has been languishing in jail
for the last five years.

379
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,160
Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Ressa
and her news website Rappler,

380
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,880
have been buried in legal actions,
facing at least 11 cases

381
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,079
and 10 arrest warrants
since Duterte came into office,

382
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,559
and the thing is,
that's just the beginning.

383
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,880
The Philippines ranks among the top
10 deadliest countries for journalists.

384
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:17,920
Reports say as many as 19 of them

385
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,480
have been killed
since Duterte took office.

386
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,440
At news of one, he replied:
"Just because you're a journalist"

387
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:28,400
"you are not exempted from
assassination, if you're a son of a..."

388
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,680
Holy shit. That speaks
not only to his brutality,

389
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:36,880
but also to the incredible bravery
of journalists there.

390
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,359
The possibility of assassination

391
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,240
is the kind of thing that can
thin out a work force.

392
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,440
If Michaels' job's listing said:

393
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:48,200
"Applicants must have some familiarity
with candle-making and scrapbooking."

394
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:51,319
"Also, please note, employees
are not exempted from assassination,"

395
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,119
"if they're sons of bitches."

396
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,039
I don't think anyone
would work at Michaels anymore.

397
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,680
Now, thankfully, Duterte's term
is about to come to an end.

398
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,039
Presidents in the Philippines
can only serve one six-year term

399
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,920
and elections are actually
happening there tomorrow.

400
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,680
And this is a big election,
in every sense,

401
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,960
the Philippines is a nation
of 100 million people

402
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:14,240
and turnout
is often around 80 percent.

403
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,480
Unfortunately, there are some
familiar faces running in this.

404
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,119
Duterte's own daughter, Sara,
is running for vice president,

405
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,839
a position which is elected
separately in the Philippines.

406
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:29,599
To get just a little sense of her,
here she is when she was a mayor,

407
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,319
punching a local sheriff
that she was angry with.

408
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,839
And it is just not great that
you can look at that and fairly say:

409
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,200
"At least
she's not as violent as her dad."

410
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:41,839
But there's also someone
running for president,

411
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,039
and who is pretty likely to win, who
has an even more alarming last name.

412
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:51,200
A front-runner in the current polls,
Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr.

413
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,799
His father declared martial law,

414
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,000
ruling the Philippines with
a terrible human rights record,

415
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:00,640
until a popular uprising
ousted him in 1986.

416
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,200
His mother, Imelda,
still famous for her shoes.

417
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:08,480
The son of a guy who terrorized
the Philippines for years

418
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,599
is now the frontrunner to take over.

419
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,279
I'm not saying that anyone should be
judged solely on their family name.

420
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:17,319
It's just a little weird
in his particular case.

421
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:20,839
It'd be like if the most popular frozen
yogurt chain in the U.S.

422
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,240
was called
Bin Laden's Froyo Delights.

423
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,400
I'm not saying a frozen yogurt shop
cannot be called that,

424
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:29,319
I just wouldn't expect it
to be a national hit.

425
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,200
That is, after all,
why they changed it to Pinkberry.

426
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,200
As for Imelda Marcos's
gigantic shoe collection,

427
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:38,680
that wasn't
just a fun personality quirk.

428
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,400
It was a sign of the staggering scale
of the Marcoses' graft.

429
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,119
They embezzled billions of dollars
from the Philippines,

430
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,200
to the point that it was once recognized
by the Guinness World Records

431
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,759
as the "greatest robbery
of a government".

432
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:55,240
It is weird for them to be handing out
records for such a terrible thing.

433
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:59,240
It's like giving Lee Harvey Oswald
an award for "most JFK's shot".

434
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,839
But the enormity
of the Marcos family's theft

435
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,920
makes how Bongbong has described
his childhood on the campaign trail

436
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,480
a little hard to swallow.

437
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:12,799
My parents would never
let us forget

438
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,200
that this is not yours,
this is from the people.

439
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,599
Everything we have, all the advantages
that we have gained,

440
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,039
any successes that we have achieved
and any comfort or privilege we enjoy

441
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,559
comes from the people.

442
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,160
Now, I will say this:
that is not technically inaccurate.

443
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,759
The Marcoses are sort of
the British Museum of families,

444
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:38,480
in that most of what they have
is fucking stolen.

445
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:41,839
So, if you are wondering
how on earth it is possible

446
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,240
for the son of the Philippines'
most notorious leader

447
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:46,440
to now be on the brink
of running the country,

448
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:48,759
that is what this story is about.

449
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,079
And before we start,

450
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,960
there is a lot of history
between the U.S. and the Philippines

451
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:56,720
and none of it
reflects particularly well on us.

452
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,400
To give you just a quick rundown,

453
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,240
first, the U.S. bought
the Philippines in 1898,

454
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:04,079
then utterly brutalized them
in their fight for independence

455
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,319
in the Philippine-American War,
which resulted in "200 000 casualties",

456
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,599
then subjected them to 50 years
of repressive and racist colonial rule,

457
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,359
and then, even after granting them
their independence in 1946,

458
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,400
continued to use the CIA
to meddle in their affairs.

459
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,319
It was an attitude
of unchecked imperialism

460
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,680
that was, and I do not say this lightly,
borderline British.

461
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,079
The story of the... That hurt,
didn't it, and it should have done!

462
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,839
But the story of the Marcoses dynasty
really begins in 1965,

463
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,799
when Ferdinand Marcos was elected.

464
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,359
While initially presenting himself
as a reformer,

465
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,920
by his second term, facing dissent,
he cracked down hard,

466
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
inventing or exaggerating internal
threats to justify imposing martial law.

467
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:52,319
And that was a period which was,
to put it very, very mildly,

468
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,480
a bad time to be in the Philippines.

469
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,799
Under martial law,
some "34 000 were tortured"

470
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,799
and thousands more were killed.

471
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,079
The Marcoses were siphoning off
money on an astonishing scale,

472
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,759
with Imelda particularly adept
at spending it.

473
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,920
Imelda,
known as "the iron butterfly",

474
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,119
would become a notorious
jet-setting socialite and fashion icon,

475
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:20,279
amassing hundreds of millions
in jewels, fine art, real estate.

476
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:24,880
Her travels so luxurious, she once
reportedly spent 2000 dollars

477
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,240
on chewing gum
during a layover in San Francisco.

478
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,759
She even forced an airplane
departing Rome

479
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:35,160
to make a U-turn
because she forgot to buy cheese.

480
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,680
Hold on, 'cause I do have
some questions there.

481
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:41,920
First, what do you mean "forced"
an airplane?

482
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,279
Did Imelda storm the cockpit?

483
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:47,039
Did a pilot say a soft prayer to see
his children again

484
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,079
all because Imelda Marcos
had a hankering for pecorino?

485
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:53,720
Also, if you forget to buy cheese
in Italy, you're okay!

486
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:57,240
Filipino cuisine is perfectly delicious
without it.

487
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:00,039
Anyone who's eaten a single plate
of adobo knows

488
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:03,400
there is no need to introduce
aged cow jizz into the equation.

489
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,240
But as the Marcoses plundered
and mismanaged the country,

490
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:10,759
the average Filipino suffered badly,
the economy was in crisis,

491
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:14,119
and the incomes of wage laborers
declined substantially,

492
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,799
to the point that, by the end
of Ferdinand's time in office,

493
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,160
many Filipinos were surviving
on "less than 2 dollars a day."

494
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:25,559
While Bongbong is not innately
responsible for actions of his father,

495
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,359
he very much benefited
from that spending spree.

496
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,200
The Marcoses
lavished money on their children,

497
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,039
including this birthday party
for their daughter.

498
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,200
Extravagant parties
on the presidential yacht,

499
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,720
decadent by the standards
of this Catholic nation.

500
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:48,039
Ferdinand Jr., nicknamed Bongbong,
governor of the family's home province,

501
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,680
is the man in the flashing bow tie.

502
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:54,200
What did I just watch there?
I don't know what's more unsettling,

503
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:57,359
the adult baby emerging
from a cake screaming "mommy"

504
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:00,119
or the fact that while Bongbong
looks very young there,

505
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,039
he was actually a governor then.

506
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:06,200
And honestly, I would not trust a man
wearing that bow tie to run anything.

507
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:08,720
I wouldn't even trust him with the job
that he's dressed for there:

508
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,480
bringing out the birthday cake
at an Olive Garden.

509
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,920
The Marcoses were ultimately
forced to flee the country

510
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,440
after a mass uprising in 1986.

511
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:20,480
But Ferdinand held on
to the billions that he stole.

512
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,559
They were granted asylum in Hawaii
and took a lot with them on the plane,

513
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,000
showing up with "7 million
in cash and gems"

514
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:33,839
and "24 bars of gold engraved: 'To
my husband on our 24th anniversary.'"

515
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:36,640
Which is not remotely romantic.

516
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,480
That anniversary present
is the pilfering billionaire equivalent

517
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,079
of handing your spouse
an envelope of cash labeled:

518
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,000
"we have been married
for 24 years as of today."

519
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,640
But obviously, they did have
to leave some things behind,

520
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,920
and for many in the Philippines,
it was a real shock to see

521
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,759
the sheer extent to which
they'd just been robbed.

522
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,440
Filipinos who used to be kept blocks
from the Marcoses' private universe

523
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:03,559
got a 20-minute kaleidoscope
of unimaginable luxury.

524
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:09,680
Including the former
first lady's 10-foot-wide bed.

525
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:13,039
That's why a lot of people here
in the Philippines are starving.

526
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:15,759
As far as Ray is concerned,
the Marcoses belong in jail.

527
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:17,920
He can come back here
in the Philippines

528
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,039
to face what he do
to the people of the Philippines.

529
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,240
Yeah, it's funny, seeing the wealth
of the rulers who ripped you off

530
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:28,680
does tend to put things
into perspective.

531
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:31,839
It's like how after French workers
learned of the majesty of Versailles

532
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,400
in the 18th century, the revolution
was right around the corner.

533
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,519
Hold on, they have
four gold-plated pipe organs?

534
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,480
Yeah, these motherfuckers
are gonna have to go.

535
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:44,640
Now, in the end,
a government commission was set up

536
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,000
to track down and recover
the stolen money and assets,

537
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:52,480
but 36 years later, thanks to court
delays and the Marcoses fighting them,

538
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:55,160
they've only retrieved
about 5 billion,

539
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,920
or around half of what
was estimated to have been stolen.

540
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,200
This is actually something
that Bongbong was directly asked about

541
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,759
when he ran
for vice president six years ago,

542
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:06,680
and his response back
then was pretty infuriating.

543
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,000
An apology
should be voluntarily given.

544
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:13,079
We cannot force it out of him.

545
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,960
But for me, it's the recognition
of the numerous mistakes in the past.

546
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:23,359
Those include the hidden wealth
that until now has not been returned.

547
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,240
It is stolen
from the people of the nation.

548
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:29,440
I cannot give what I do not have.

549
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:36,960
I do not have control. I do not have
any knowledge of any of the things.

550
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:41,480
Once again, let me repeat,
I cannot give what I do not have.

551
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:46,119
Not great. But also, I will say, credit
to the sign language interpreter,

552
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,680
who managed to get
across not just what he was saying,

553
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:52,240
but also communicate
his whole "big angry crybaby" vibe.

554
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,839
It is impressive that Bongbong is
somehow the biggest baby in this story

555
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,240
and it also contains
this fucking guy.

556
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:03,119
Despite being
booed for that response,

557
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,119
Bongbong is now on the edge
of being elected president.

558
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,079
And that is because,
over the past decade,

559
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,839
something kind of remarkable
has happened in the Philippines

560
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,480
and that is,
history has been rewritten.

561
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:16,640
Since the return of the Marcoses,

562
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,240
there's been a trickle of new
information in YouTube,

563
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:26,440
in Google, that's a revision
of the interpretation of martial law.

564
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:31,559
What do you read,
what do you hear about martial law?

565
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,279
About President Marcos?

566
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:38,119
During martial law the life
of people became peaceful.

567
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,440
I also heard
the Philippines became rich.

568
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,519
I think martial law
made the Philippines better.

569
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:55,799
That is a stark rewriting
of a terrible period.

570
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:59,319
And I do realize that the U.S.
isn't exactly perfect here, either.

571
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,839
We grapple with our greatest monsters
by putting up reminders of them

572
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:07,200
on mountains, in town squares
and on crisp 20 dollar bills.

573
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:12,480
This willful distortion of history
has been abetted by the internet,

574
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:17,480
as the Philippines frequently ranks
as the most online nation in the world.

575
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,960
That is actually something that
Duterte very much benefited from,

576
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,599
as he "rode a wave of false stories,
paid trolling and Facebook engagement"

577
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,440
all the way to the presidency.

578
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:29,039
Facebook itself even called him

579
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:32,359
the "undisputed king
of Facebook conversations",

580
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:35,160
a title surprisingly not held
by your uncle

581
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,880
who has hot takes on the vaccine
he thinks you should know about.

582
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,720
And the internet is now similarly
awash in Facebook posts and videos

583
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:46,960
that both glorify and romanticize
the Marcos family.

584
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,920
Popular posts on Facebook
have explained away

585
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,759
Ferdinand's ill-gotten wealth,
saying that his fortune came

586
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:56,279
from treasure left by a Japanese
general after World War II

587
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:59,200
or that it was earned
for being a "fantastic lawyer".

588
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,000
There's also this one suggesting
that Marcos, at one point,

589
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:05,119
gave bread
to a young Michael Jordan.

590
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,559
It seems to have originated as a joke

591
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,719
but has since been passed around
completely seriously.

592
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,719
Let's just break this story down.

593
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,159
On December 24th, 1969,
the Marcos family was in Wilmington,

594
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:19,719
North Carolina,
to celebrate the holidays.

595
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,760
That tracks. If you're a billionaire
from the other side of the world

596
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,840
and you want to celebrate
the holidays in America,

597
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,519
there's only one place that you're going
and that's Wilmington, North Carolina.

598
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,119
Then, President Marcos
was walking in a park

599
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,159
and he saw a skinny child
begging for food.

600
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,320
He gave him a whole box
of Nutribun and said:

601
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,239
"Bring this with you child, someday you
will grow up to be someone important."

602
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,679
So, to be clear, in this story,
Marcos was walking through a park,

603
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,920
holding bread, specifically Nutribun,
a bread mainly sold in the Philippines.

604
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,159
Meaning Marcos flew
to the United States with Nutribun

605
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,039
because he was like:
"What if we get to Wilmington,"

606
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:59,400
"my favorite holiday destination,
and they don't have any bread there?"

607
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,119
Then, he went to the park and passed
like 10 other kids, thinking:

608
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:05,480
"None of you are gonna grow up
to be important,"

609
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:07,760
"so you're not getting
any of my park bread",

610
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,840
then he saw Michael Jordan
and was like:

611
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,760
"Wait, I'm pretty sure
that you are gonna be important,"

612
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,880
"so have this bread that I brought
from the other side of the world."

613
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,480
And then that kid
grew up to be Michael Jordan,

614
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:21,960
the greatest basketball player
who ever lived.

615
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:25,880
That is the dumbest story involving
a young Jordan I ever heard

616
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,639
and I have seen "Space Jam".

617
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,199
So, that is just a taste
of the online nonsense

618
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,119
which is successfully reframing
the Marcos family history.

619
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:39,679
And at the same time, Bongbong's
main rival, Leni Robredo,

620
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:42,039
the current vice president
and the woman that you saw

621
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,519
challenging him
in that debate clip earlier,

622
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:48,039
has faced vicious attacks online,
ranging from false allegations

623
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:50,239
that she has ties
to armed communist rebels

624
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,920
to phony rumors
that she murdered her husband.

625
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,559
In fact, fact-checkers have reported

626
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:57,519
that "almost all the disinformation
about Robredo is negative",

627
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,760
while any disinformation
about Bongbong

628
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,519
"overwhelmingly puts him
in a positive light."

629
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:06,800
But maybe the most fantastical lie
that Bongbong's campaign has told

630
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,840
is actually the most mundane one:

631
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,719
that he's not the scion
of a political crime family,

632
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,519
he's just a regular, ordinary citizen
who happen to run for president.

633
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:20,960
Here is how his wife described
the moment that he decided to run.

634
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,920
Six months ago,
he wasn't yet sure what to do,

635
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,760
we had no party, you know.

636
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,639
And then one day we were watching
"Ant-Man" in the room,

637
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:34,519
'cause we love Marvel movies,
and then he looked at me

638
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:37,639
and he goes: "Okay, we're gonna
do this," he told me.

639
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:39,920
I said: "Do what?"
Run for the presidency.

640
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,440
No fucking way.
That did not happen.

641
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:47,880
I am calling total bullshit
on the idea

642
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,960
that Bongbong decided to run
for president out of nowhere,

643
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:52,199
mid-Marvel film.

644
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:56,159
I can think of a much more salient
reason that he'd want to run.

645
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:59,239
As President, Bongbong would hold
sway over the commission

646
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,960
devoted to investigating
and recovering his family's wealth,

647
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:03,639
as well as the tax office.

648
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,920
Which would be
particularly useful for him,

649
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
as the Marcoses have refused to pay
a tax bill

650
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,559
that reportedly amounts to 3.9 billion
dollars, including penalties.

651
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:15,039
So Bongbong could easily tell
his own administration

652
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,920
to just forget about his massive debt,
which is a very appealing idea for him.

653
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,320
When you think of it,

654
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,800
"Ant-Man" could actually be
the perfect movie to inspire him,

655
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,679
given that it's about a thief
whose questionable past is forgotten

656
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,039
after he rises to power
using resources that he also stole.

657
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,159
Of course he fucking likes
"Ant-Man"!

658
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,840
Bongbong's brand relaunch
has not worked on absolutely everyone.

659
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:42,400
Plenty of Filipinos
are still opposed to him

660
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,239
and to having the Marcos era
rewritten in front of their very eyes.

661
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,239
Despite trailing Bongbong
massively in the polls,

662
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,039
Leni Robredo
has inspired huge rallies there.

663
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,599
Walden Bello, who is running against
Sara Duterte for vice president,

664
00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:00,280
has been outspoken about just
how outrageous he finds all of this.

665
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,119
Marcos has created
a big public relations machine

666
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:09,119
that uses social media
to try to convince people

667
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:14,760
that the 14 years of martial law,
the collective nightmarian,

668
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:21,360
he's trying to use social media
and his hundreds of trolls to say:

669
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,519
"My God, golden years..."

670
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,320
This is a family
that has raped the country,

671
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,079
it has not apologized to the country,
and he wants to rape the country again.

672
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:33,800
Fuck you, Marcos!

673
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,679
Yeah, well put.
Very well put.

674
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,280
It's clear, no matter how hard
you try to reinvent yourself,

675
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:47,079
there's always going to be some
who remember who you really are.

676
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,599
Whether you're a new college
freshman trying on a British accent

677
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:52,320
or a massive tech oligarchy

678
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,000
trying to paper over its complicity
in violence and genocide.

679
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:57,800
Mark, I think Meta's really
starting to catch on!

680
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:01,639
Just give it a few more weeks, maybe.
You're doing great, buddy!

681
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,880
People are really pumped for this.

682
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:08,639
It has been truly amazing
to see the Philippines election unfold.

683
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:12,280
Because in this election,
they're not voting on their future.

684
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,119
They're voting on their past,

685
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:16,800
specifically, which one
do they want to believe?

686
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,559
The one where Ferdinand Marcos

687
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:21,679
wreaked havoc on a country
and its people under martial law?

688
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,960
Or the one where he was somehow
the greatest NBA scout of all time?

689
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,840
I know that most people watching this
are not eligible to vote in it,

690
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,599
although, if you are,
and you are watching:

691
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:34,800
"Kumusta!
Maraming salamat po!"

692
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:38,960
And to you, let me just say this,
I do get why you'd be skeptical

693
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:41,159
about a breakdown of your politics
from someone

694
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:44,360
with what I can only describe
as "big colonizer energy",

695
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,880
and who lives in a country
that is frankly no stranger

696
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,920
to dishonest billionaires who propelled
themselves to power with Facebook lies.

697
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,760
Don't listen to me. But maybe
do listen to your fellow citizens,

698
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,280
who both remember the past
and are determined not to repeat it.

699
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,039
Because Bongbong Marcos
has shown virtually no remorse

700
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:06,199
for what his father
put the country through.

701
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,880
And if the Philippines is to avoid
more of the same graft and violence

702
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,119
that they've experienced
over the past 50 years,

703
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:15,559
they are going to need these people
and others like them to continue

704
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:19,079
speaking out and telling
the likes of Bongbong Marcos,

705
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:23,400
if I may use the poetic words of
the Philippines' current president...

706
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,920
"Fuck you!" And now, this.

707
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:35,440
WDIV Meteorologist Brandon Roux
enjoys Cinco de Mayo a Little Too Much.

708
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:40,320
Take a look at a beautiful skyline
here and a beautiful sky,

709
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,760
el cielo, on this Cinco de Mayo.

710
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,000
Cinco de Mayo tomorrow
should start with sun.

711
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,480
A little bit of sunshine, el sol.
We'll keep Cinco de Mayo mostly dry.

712
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,320
Cinco de Mayo,
I think we hold off the rain.

713
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,079
Looks pretty good here
on this Cinco de Mayo.

714
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,920
It will be sesenta tres.
Sesenta y tres.

715
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:05,840
Rain chances, if you have
the Cinco de Mayo fiesta plans.

716
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,840
Little fiesta, then a quick siesta.
Parcialmente nublado.

717
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:15,400
El cielo es parcialmente nublado,
o mayormente nublado.

718
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,000
What language was that?

719
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:20,960
I just said: "The sky is partly cloudy
or at times, mostly cloudy."

720
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:25,039
Here's Kim DeGiulio
with your traffico.

721
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,639
All right, traffic looking bueno.

722
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,679
That's our show. Thanks for watching.
We'll see you next week. Good night!
