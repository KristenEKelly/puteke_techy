WELCOME TO TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT"!
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

6
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:34,933
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.

7
00:00:35,018 --> 00:00:36,730
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

8
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:39,159
JOE BIDEN SIGNED THE
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT,

9
00:00:39,244 --> 00:00:41,956
THE C-D-C ANNOUNCED A MAJOR
REOGANIZATION, AND THE FALLOUT

FROM THE FBI SEARCH AT MAR A

00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:48,230
OUTLANDISH RATIONALIZATIONS FOR

14
00:00:48,322 --> 00:00:49,831
WHY IT WAS OKAY FOR HIM TO KEEP

15
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:52,152
SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS THERE,
INCLUDING THIS ONE.

16
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:55,670
>> REALLY, IF YOU LOOK AT THE
ESPIONAGE ACT, IT'S NOT REALLY

17
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,681
ABOUT TAKING THE DOCUMENTS,

18
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:01,193
IT'S ABOUT DESTROYING THEM,
OR HIDING THEM,

19
00:01:01,277 --> 00:01:03,365
 - OR GIVING THEM TO THE ENEMY.
- Right.

20
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,225
IT'S NOT ABOUT TAKING THEM AND
PUTTING THEM IN A PLACE

21
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,225
THAT'S ROUGHLY AS SAFE AS THEY WERE IN
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

22
00:01:10,309 --> 00:01:11,617
Okay. Uh,

23
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:12,756

RUDY WALKING RIGHT UP TO
THE LINE OF PLEADING GUILTY ON

25
00:01:15,677 --> 00:01:17,647
TRUMP'S BEHALF -- HE TOOK THE documents.

26
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:19,233
IF YOU'RE COMPARING THE SECURITY OF TWO

27
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,365
PLACES, THE TWO WORST EXAMPLES

28
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,147
WOULD BE THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE

29
00:01:23,232 --> 00:01:24,858
FLORIDA RESORT WHERE A FAILED

30
00:01:24,943 --> 00:01:27,490
BACHELORETTE CONTESTANT ACTUALLY
CLAIMED ON INSTAGRAM,

31
00:01:27,575 --> 00:01:29,295

35
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,420
AND IT'S NOT EXACTLY A SECURE

36
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:36,451
STORAGE FACILITY IF

37
00:01:36,536 --> 00:01:38,584
YOUTH PASTOR RYAN REYNOLDS HERE

38
00:01:38,669 --> 00:01:41,233
CAN JUST WANDER AROUND
THE ****Y LIGHTS.

39
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:43,506
BUT WE'RE GOING TO START WITH
THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS.

40
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:45,349
MORE PRIMARIES TOOK PLACE THIS
WEEK.

41
00:01:45,434 --> 00:01:47,818
IN WYOMING, REPUBLICANS
OVERWHELMINGLY VOTED OUT

42
00:01:47,903 --> 00:01:49,670

AND IN ALASKA, A LOT'S BEEN
HAPPENING.

46
00:01:55,598 --> 00:01:57,130
THEY HAVE OPEN PRIMARIES, WHERE

47
00:01:57,215 --> 00:01:58,673
THE TOP FOUR FINISHERS,

48
00:01:58,758 --> 00:02:00,867
REGARDLESS OF PARTY, GO ON TO

49
00:02:00,952 --> 00:02:01,600
THE GENERAL ELECTION.

50
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:03,211
SO, ON THE SENATE SIDE, THERE'LL

51
00:02:03,277 --> 00:02:04,710
BE AT LEAST TWO REPUBLICANS ON

52
00:02:04,795 --> 00:02:06,272

53
00:02:06,357 --> 00:02:08,060
SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI, AND THE

54
00:02:08,145 --> 00:02:09,905
MORE EXTREME KELLY TSHIBAKA, WHO

55
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,765
NOT ONLY QUESTIONS THE 2020

56

00:02:17,825 --> 00:02:20,546

>> John: OKAY, I HAVE A MILLION

72
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:41,999
PROBLEMS WITH THAT.

73
00:02:42,084 --> 00:02:43,883
FIRST: "CRIME CASCADING" DOESN'T
WORK.

74
00:02:43,968 --> 00:02:45,273
CASCADING DOESN'T REALLY TAKE A

75
00:02:45,358 --> 00:02:46,632
DIRECT OBJECT LIKE THAT.

76
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:47,976
NEXT: "ENERGY" AND

77
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:49,436
"ANNIHILATING" DON'T START WITH
THE SAME LETTER.

78
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,414
WHICH IS WEIRD, BECAUSE THERE

79
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:52,836
ARE TONS OF OTHER OPTIONS FOR
"E" -- "EXTINGUISHING",

80
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:54,101
"EXTERMINATING",
EVEN JUST A

81
00:02:54,186 --> 00:02:55,804
SIMPLE "ENDING" IF YOU'RE
FEELING LAZY.

82
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:57,577
THEN THERE'S
"MANDATE MILITATING", WHICH

83
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,289
MAKES NO SENSE AND I'M NOT EVEN

84
00:02:59,374 --> 00:03:01,733
GOING TO TRY AND EXPLAIN IT.
AND OF COURSE THE GRAND FINALE

85
00:03:01,857 --> 00:03:04,007
OF "AMERICA OBLITERATING
AGENDA"?

86
00:03:04,092 --> 00:03:05,752
WHAT THE **** ARE YOU DOING

87
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,421
GOING "A" TO "O" TO "A" THERE?

88
00:03:07,506 --> 00:03:10,468
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE A GREAT REPLACEMENT
FOR "OBLITERATING" IN THIS SITUATION?

89
00:03:10,553 --> 00:03:11,398
"ANNIHILATING."

90
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,570
BUT IT'S TOO LATE, BECAUSE YOU

91
00:03:12,655 --> 00:03:14,561
BLEW THAT ONE RIGHT AT THE
START.

92
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,147

00:03:22,624 --> 00:03:24,101

99
00:03:27,694 --> 00:03:29,309

101
00:03:31,413 --> 00:03:34,247
PENGUIN, AND OWL ARE RUNNING FOR
OFFICE.

102
00:03:34,397 --> 00:03:35,867
YOU PREFER ELK, AND YOU'RE

103
00:03:35,952 --> 00:03:37,507
DEFINITELY ANTI-PENGUIN.

104
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,852
SO MAYBE YOU'LL FILL OUT YOUR

105
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,499
BALLOT LIKE THIS: ELK, POLAR

106
00:03:41,584 --> 00:03:43,858
BEAR, OWL, AND PENGUIN.

107
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:45,757
YOU COULD ALSO CHOOSE TO ONLY

108
00:03:45,842 --> 00:03:46,526
PARTIALLY FILL OUT THE BALLOT,

109
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,624
AND JUST LEAVE OFF PENGUIN

110
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:49,496
ENTIRELY.

111
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,453
>> John: EXCELLENT.

112
00:03:50,538 --> 00:03:52,054
I LOVE SO MUCH THERE, FROM THE

113
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:53,382
FACT THAT HOST DIDN'T FEEL THE

114
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,420
NEED TO TAKE HIS
FESTIVELY-WRAPPED CELL PHONE OUT

115
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:57,225
OF HIS BREAST POCKET, TO THE

116
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,608
OFFENSIVELY ALASKAN CHOICE OF
CANDIDATES.

117
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:01,983
IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF NEW
JERSEY EXPLAINING RANKED CHOICE

118
00:04:02,068 --> 00:04:03,397
VOTING USING BON JOVI,

119
00:04:03,482 --> 00:04:05,584
TONY SOPRANO, A DEER THAT'S

120
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,181
NEVER EATEN FOOD INTENDED FOR

121
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,349
DEER, AND MELANOMA.

122
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,856
ALSO, GOOD CALL LOSING PENGUIN,

123
00:04:10,941 --> 00:04:12,109
WHICH, OF COURSE, DON'T EVEN

124
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,716
HAVE THE DECENCY TO LIVE IN THE
STATE.

125
00:04:13,801 --> 00:04:15,848
BUT I GUESS IT JUST GOES TO
SHOW, EVEN WHEN THEY'RE MADE UP

126
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:20,247
OF FICTIONAL ANIMALS, EVERY
ELECTION HAS TO HAVE ITS DR. OZ.

127
00:04:20,395 --> 00:04:22,513
NOW, THE REASON ALASKANS NEED TO

128
00:04:22,598 --> 00:04:23,677
FILL THAT HOUSE SEAT IS THAT

129
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:24,958
DON YOUNG, WHO SERVED SINCE

130
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:27,450
1973, DIED EARLIER THIS YEAR.

131
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:30,981
AND IF YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF
DON YOUNG, HE WAS A "LOT".

132
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:32,234
JOHN BOEHNER ONCE CLAIMED THAT

133
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,895
YOUNG PINNED HIM AGAINST A WALL

134
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,914
IN THE HOUSE AND HELD A TEN-INCH

135
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:37,711
KNIFE TO HIS THROAT.

136
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,413
BUT HE ALSO HAD LESS LIKEABLE

137
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,848
MOMENTS, LIKE CALLING THE

138
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:43,113
BP OIL SPILL NOT AN
ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER BUT

139
00:04:43,198 --> 00:04:46,426
"A NATURAL PHENOMENA",
REFERRING TO LATINOS USING A

140
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:48,074
RACIAL SLUR, AND BEHAVING LIKE

141
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,285
THIS DURING A DISCUSSION OF

142
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,938
NAMING A POST OFFICE AFTER A

143
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:52,671
MARINE WHO WAS KILLED IN
AFGHANISTAN.

144
00:04:52,756 --> 00:04:55,085
JUST WATCH THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF
YOUR SCREEN.

145
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,996
>> STAFF SERGEANT DeAUGUSTINE

146
00:04:57,202 --> 00:05:01,306
WAS KILLED ON MARCH 27, 2012, IN

147
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:04,010
HELMAND PROVINCE, AFGHANISTAN, A

148
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:06,455
FIERCE BATTLEGROUND WHERE OVER

149
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,768
19,000 MARINES WERE DEPLOYED.

150
00:05:09,853 --> 00:05:11,314
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

151
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,547
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SOMBER
MOMENT!

152
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:16,216
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF SOMEONE
DISRESPECTED YOUR MEMORY LIKE

153
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:17,818
THAT?
WATCH.

154
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:19,565
>> DON YOUNG, THE SO-CALLED DEAN

155
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,955
OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

156
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,518
HAS PASSED AWAY AT THE AGE OF
88.

157
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:24,674
>> John: YEAH, SEE?

158
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,948
DOESN'T FEEL GOOD, DOES IT, DON?

159
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:27,136
YOU'RE SO LUCKY YOU'RE DEAD

160
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:28,795
RIGHT NOW!

161
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:29,730
AND THEN THERE WAS YOUNG'S

162
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,131
CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE DECORATION

163
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,399
CHOICES, WHICH WERE STRIKING,

164
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,034
AND ALWAYS HAD THE CAPACITY TO

165
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,402
SURPRISE.

166
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,070
>> THAT'S A HECK OF A GAVEL.

167
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:37,738
>> YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS, DON'T

168
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,855
YOU?

169
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,476
>> UHHH, YEAH.

170
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,065
>> - YOU DO, HUH? WHAT IS IT?
- I DUNNO.

171
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,894
>> IT'S A WALRUS'S PENIS.

172
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,102
>> John: YEAH.

173
00:05:50,187 --> 00:05:51,547
THE QUESTION "WHAT IS IT" COULD

174
00:05:51,632 --> 00:05:52,594
REALLY ONLY BE ANSWERED WITH "I
DUNNO" THERE.

175
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:55,688
THE BIGGEST RED FLAG POSSIBLE
WOULD BE FOR SOMEONE TO SAY,

176
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:57,172
"HUNDRED PERCENT, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT,

177
00:05:57,257 --> 00:06:00,492
I COULD TELL YOU BLINDFOLDED:
THAT'S A WALRUS DICK."

178
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:02,578
ALSO, I'M NOT SURE WHERE DON

179
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:04,680
YOUNG GOT THAT GAVEL, BUT I'M
JUST GOING TO ASSUME HE USED TO

180
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,758
HOST A PATERNITY COURT REALITY
SHOW FOR WALRUSES.

181
00:06:07,842 --> 00:06:09,165
WHICH ALL WE'D WATCH.

182
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,211
SO CLEARLY, DON YOUNG IS LEAVING

183
00:06:11,296 --> 00:06:13,000
SOME BIG, WEIRD SHOES TO FILL,

184
00:06:13,085 --> 00:06:14,220
AND THERE'S ALREADY A NAME-BRAND

185
00:06:14,305 --> 00:06:15,573
CONTENDER TO FILL THEM.

186
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:17,360
AND DEEP DOWN, YOU ALREADY KNOW

187
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:18,613
WHO IT IS, RIGHT?

188
00:06:18,698 --> 00:06:20,300
ALASKA NEEDS A POLITICIAN?

189
00:06:20,385 --> 00:06:22,000
YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING.

190
00:06:22,085 --> 00:06:23,961
>> IF I WERE ASKED TO SERVE IN

191
00:06:24,046 --> 00:06:27,195
IN THE HOUSE AND TAKE HIS PLACE,

192
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,906
I WOULD BE HUMBLED AND HONORED AND
I WOULD.

193
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:31,657
YEAH, IN A HEARTBEAT, I WOULD.

194
00:06:31,742 --> 00:06:34,602
>> John: YEP!
SARAH ****ING PALIN'S BACK, AND

195
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:36,461
IT'S LIKE IT'S 2008 ALL OVER
AGAIN!

196
00:06:36,594 --> 00:06:39,158
SHE'S RUNNING FOR OFFICE,
THE U-S ENTERED A BEAR MARKET, AND

197
00:06:39,243 --> 00:06:41,681
SEX AND THE CITY IS MAKING
SPIN-OFFS IT, QUITE FRANKLY,

198
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:43,485
DOESN'T HAVE THE MATERIAL TO
BACK UP.

199
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,857
SOCIETY IS GOING BACKWARDS.

200
00:06:45,942 --> 00:06:47,594
UNSURPRISINGLY, PALIN'S PLATFORM

201
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:49,128
IS FULL OF CULTURE WAR BULLSHIT.

202
00:06:49,213 --> 00:06:50,820
SHE'S SAID WE "CAN'T GIVE UP" ON

203
00:06:50,905 --> 00:06:52,602
BENGHAZI AND HILLARY'S MISSING

204
00:06:52,687 --> 00:06:53,906
EMAILS, AND HAS VOWED TO FIGHT

205
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:55,659
GUN CONTROL AND ABORTION RIGHTS.

206
00:06:55,744 --> 00:06:56,985
BUT SOME ALASKANS WORRY

207
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,632
 SHE'S ONLY RUNNING FOR THE FAME.

208
00:06:58,717 --> 00:07:00,235
LOCAL PRESS HAS SAID SHE'S BEEN

209
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,625
NOTABLY DIFFICULT FOR ALASKANS

210
00:07:01,742 --> 00:07:03,321
TO TRACK DOWN, AND POINTED OUT

211
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:04,756
SHE'S TURNED DOWN CANDIDATE

212
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:06,289
FORUMS, INCLUDING ONE HOSTED BY

213
00:07:06,374 --> 00:07:07,842
THE ANCHORAGE REPUBLICAN WOMEN.

214
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,125
SOMETHING THEY HANDLED WITH
SUBLIME PASSIVE-AGGRESSION BY

215
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,911
LEAVING AN EMPTY CHAIR FOR HER

216
00:07:12,996 --> 00:07:15,453
WITH HER NAME ON IT
AND THE WORD, "NO".

217
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:16,852
[LAUGHTER]

218
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,586
AND I KNOW CHAIRS DON'T HAVE

219
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,203
AGENCY, OR ACCESS TO A PRINTER,

220
00:07:20,288 --> 00:07:21,805
BUT IT DOES LOOK LIKE SOMEONE

221
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,158
TAPED THE NAME "PALIN" TO A

222
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:24,790
CHAIR, AND NOW THE CHAIR ITSELF

223
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,578
IS PROTESTING IT.

224
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:28,294
ONE CONSERVATIVE PUBLISHER IN

225
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:30,305
ALASKA EVEN SAID, "SARAH KNOWS

226
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:33,016
HOW TO WORK A CROWD, BUT IT'S
SARAH, INC."

227
00:07:33,101 --> 00:07:35,828
WHICH HONESTLY SOUNDS LIKE THE
TITLE OF A SITCOM STARRING KAT

228
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,375
DENNINGS THAT'S ALREADY QUIETLY
DISAPPEARED FROM HBO MAX.

229
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,602
HBO MAX: IT'S NOT TV.

230
00:07:41,687 --> 00:07:42,961
IT'S A SERIES OF TAX WRITEOFFS

231
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:44,594
TO APPEASE WALL STREET.

232
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:48,086
LOOK, PALIN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A
GRIFTER.

233
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:49,956
AND IF THERE WAS ANY DOUBT ABOUT

234
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,492
WHAT SHE REALLY CARES ABOUT,

235
00:07:51,577 --> 00:07:53,406
CHECK OUT THIS CHAOTICALLY SHOT

236
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:54,859
AND EDITED VIDEO FROM HER

237
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,441
INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT IN MAY, WHERE

238
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:57,776
SHE SPOUTS A STREAM OF CAMPAIGN

239
00:07:57,842 --> 00:07:59,244
PLATITUDES, THEN MAKES CLEAR

240
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,629
WHAT SHE'S REALLY UP TO.

241
00:08:01,746 --> 00:08:05,483
>> I'M STANDING HERE GETTING
READY FOR A RIDE BACK TO MY HOME

242
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,218
WITH OTHER CANDIDATES RUNNING

243
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:09,254
FOR THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS

244
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,543
TO REALLY MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

245
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:13,121
THINGS ARE GOING ON IN OUR
WORLD, IN OUR COUNTRY, AND WE'RE

246
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:14,340
GONNA TAKE IT BACK.

247
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:16,879
YAHOOS RUNNING OUR COUNTRY RIGHT
NOW.

248
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,363
WHOO, YEAH.

249
00:08:18,448 --> 00:08:19,574
THEY NEED TO REPLACED.

250
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:20,732
SO, JOHN.

251
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:22,887
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU.
AND KNOW THAT THOSE AROUND YOU

252
00:08:22,972 --> 00:08:23,983
WHO LOVE YOU SO MUCH AND SPEAK

253
00:08:24,068 --> 00:08:26,035
SO HIGHLY OF YOU-ESPECIALLY

254
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,403
JUSTIN-BUT OTHERS, THEY TOO

255
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:29,926
WISHING YOU HAPPY, HAPPY
BIRTHDAY.

256
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:32,824
>> John: YEAH, IT SEEMS TO BE
AN AD FOR BOTH HER CAMPAIGN, AND

257
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,926
HER CAMEO, WITH THE CAPTION EVEN

258
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:36,348
READING, "DON'T FORGET FATHER'S

259
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,567
DAY CAMEO ORDERS FOR YOUR LOVED
ONES".

260
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,801
WHICH IS A SPECTACULAR RACKET,

261
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:42,020
SINCE SHE'S ESSENTIALLY SAYING

262
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:43,254
"DON'T FORGET TO PAY ME TO

263
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:45,390
BRAINWASH YOUR DAD!"

264
00:08:45,456 --> 00:08:46,558
ALSO, FUN FACT: THE JOHN IN

265
00:08:46,624 --> 00:08:46,891
QUESTION?

266
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,394
THAT WAS ME.

267
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,197
MY BUDDY JUSTIN -- HE LOVES ME

268
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:52,831
AND SPEAKS VERY HIGHLY OF ME --

269
00:08:52,897 --> 00:08:53,431
GOT IT FOR ME, AND IT WAS THE

270
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:55,233
BEST GIFT I'VE EVER RECEIVED.

271
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,035
BUT BEING SARAH PALIN IS GOOD

272
00:08:57,101 --> 00:08:58,436
BUSINESS -- ON HER FINANCIAL

273
00:08:58,503 --> 00:08:59,470
DISCLOSURES, SHE REVEALED THAT

274
00:08:59,537 --> 00:09:02,907
LAST YEAR, SHE MADE OVER TWO

275
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:03,508
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM

276
00:09:03,575 --> 00:09:04,909
CAMEO.

277
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:06,010
WHICH SHE DID BY CHARGING $199

278
00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:07,011
PER VIDEO.

279
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:08,780
AND THAT'S JUST TOO MUCH TO PAY

280
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:10,048
FOR AN INCOHERENT MESSAGE FROM A

281
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:11,749
PARKING LOT.

282
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:13,017
ESPECIALLY WHEN, FOR JUST $75,

283
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:13,585
YOU CAN GET A MESSAGE FROM

284
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:17,288
CARSON KRESSLEY, WHO'LL TELL YOU

285
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:17,822
YOU LOOK GREAT.

286
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:18,056
LOOK.

287
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:18,756
>> HEY, JOHN, CARSON KRESSLEY

288
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:19,824
HERE!

289
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:21,159
YOU LOOK GREAT!

290
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:23,127
HAVE YOU BEEN MOISTURIZING?

291
00:09:23,194 --> 00:09:25,196
THAT'LL BE $75, PLEASE.

292
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:26,464
>> John: THANK YOU, CARSON!

293
00:09:26,531 --> 00:09:28,933
I HAVEN'T BEEN MOISTURIZING!

294
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,702
AND LOOK -- WILL ALASKANS FALL

295
00:09:30,768 --> 00:09:32,303
FOR PALIN'S BULLSHIT?
MAYBE!

296
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,372
THEY'VE DONE SO IN THE PAST!

297
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:36,396
BUT I SURE HOPE THEY DON'T THIS
TIME.

298
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:38,053
BECAUSE FRANKLY, THE ONLY

299
00:09:38,138 --> 00:09:39,505
CONCEIVABLE STEP DOWN FROM

300
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,614
DON YOUNG WOULD BE SARAH PALIN,

301
00:09:41,702 --> 00:09:43,938
WHO, LIKE A WALRUS'S PENIS, IS A

302
00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:45,496
FUN ALASKAN NOVELTY, AND ONE

303
00:09:45,581 --> 00:09:47,730
THAT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO BUSINESS

304
00:09:47,815 --> 00:09:49,168
BEING IN CONGRESS.

305
00:09:49,268 --> 00:09:51,175
AND NOW, THIS.

306
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:54,667
>> AND NOW 60 SECONDS OF TUCKER

307
00:09:54,752 --> 00:09:57,089
CARLSON BEING RIGHT ABOUT STUFF.

308
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,222
>> AMERICA IS A RACIST COUNTRY.

309
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,222
WHITE SUPREMACY IS OUR BIGGEST
THREAT.

310
00:10:01,307 --> 00:10:02,659
REPUBLICAN SENATORS ARE

311
00:10:02,744 --> 00:10:05,058
PSYCHOSIS BIGOTS AND THEY DON'T
CARE ABOUT WOMEN.

312
00:10:05,143 --> 00:10:07,308
THIS IS A BAD COUNTRY RUN BY
RACISTS.

313
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,386
IT'S HERE HISTORY IS INHERENTLY
RACIST.

314
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:11,677
IMMIGRANTS'RE FACING PREFECT JUST

315
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:15,934
SMARTER MODERN INDUSTRY IS CREATING
EVEN IF YOU'RE AMERICAN...

316
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,230
THE PHRASES ALL LIVE MATTERS

317
00:10:18,315 --> 00:10:20,131
AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM AND THE

318
00:10:20,216 --> 00:10:23,277
CELEBRATION OF COLUMBUS DAY ARE
RACIST.

319
00:10:23,362 --> 00:10:25,066
THE CAPITAL WAS A WHITE

320
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,489
SUPREMACIST INSURRECTION.

321
00:10:27,574 --> 00:10:29,590
ONLY LOSERS AND FREAK SUPPORT

322
00:10:29,675 --> 00:10:31,316
DONALD TRUMP YEAR AGO I'VE

323
00:10:31,401 --> 00:10:33,058
ENJOYED WHITE PRIVILEGE.

324
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:34,371
I'M A RACIST.

325
00:10:34,456 --> 00:10:35,316
RACIST!

326
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,869
WHITE PEOPLE ARE A HOLES!

327
00:10:36,954 --> 00:10:38,652
THIS IS PROPAGANDA AT WORK!

328
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:39,996
FOX NEWS IS PROPAGANDA!

329
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:43,848
THIS IS THE GREATEST KIND OF
PROPAGANDA DESIGNED TO DIVIDE

330
00:10:43,973 --> 00:10:45,608
THE COUNTRY BY RACE!

331
00:10:45,675 --> 00:10:46,743
TOO STUPID.

332
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,965
NONE OF THIS IS REAL.

333
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,301
IT'S ALL JUST NOISE.

334
00:10:49,386 --> 00:10:50,551
ALL OF THIS IS CRAZY.

335
00:10:50,636 --> 00:10:51,830
THIS IS TOTAL LUNACY.

336
00:10:51,915 --> 00:10:53,316
IT'S EASY TO LAUGH AT THIS BUT

337
00:10:53,383 --> 00:10:54,683
IT'S ALSO HORRIFYING.

338
00:10:54,768 --> 00:10:56,988
THINK ABOUT THE BRAINWASHING
REQUIRED TO DO THIS.

339
00:10:57,894 --> 00:11:00,293
THIS CHANNEL SHOULDN'T BE
ALLOWED.

340
00:11:01,298 --> 00:11:02,466
[LAUGHTER]

341
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:04,003
>> John: MOVING ON.

342
00:11:04,088 --> 00:11:06,826
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS
EARTH.

343
00:11:06,911 --> 00:11:09,381
IT'S BASICALLY THE OSCAR ISAAC
OF PLANETS IN THAT IT SEEMS TO

344
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:11,916
BE GETTING ALARMINGLY HOTTER
EVERY YEAR.

345
00:11:11,983 --> 00:11:15,020
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THIS PLANET'S
NOT DOING GREAT.

346
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:17,606
THE LEVEL OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN
THE ATMOSPHERE IS NOW HIGHER

347
00:11:17,691 --> 00:11:19,543
THAN EVER IN HUMAN HISTORY, AND

348
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:21,621
THE RECENT U.N.-COMMMISSIONED
CLIMATE REPORT WAS CALLED

349
00:11:21,706 --> 00:11:23,934
"AN ATLAS OF HUMAN SUFFERING".

350
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:25,057
WHICH, COINCIDENTALLY, IS ALSO

351
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,356
THE SLOGAN FOR CRAIGSLIST.

352
00:11:27,466 --> 00:11:29,535
LUCKILY, THOUGH, ONE GROUP IS

353
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,935
HERE TO FIX IT: GIANT
CORPORATIONS.

354
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:34,809
MANY ARE NOW CLAIMING THEY'VE
HIT UPON A SOLUTION -- BECOMING

355
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,871
"CARBON NEUTRAL" OR "NET ZERO".

356
00:11:36,956 --> 00:11:38,957
BASICALLY, RUNNING THEIR
BUSINESSES IN SUCH A WAY,

357
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:41,752
THEY DON'T INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF
CARBON IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

358
00:11:41,837 --> 00:11:43,887
AS OF LAST YEAR, "ONE IN FIVE OF

359
00:11:43,972 --> 00:11:45,595
THE WORLD'S TWO THOUSAND LARGEST

360
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,871
PUBLICLY LISTED COMPANIES

361
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,887
HAVE NOW COMMITTED TO A "NET-ZERO"
EMISSIONS TARGET."

362
00:11:49,972 --> 00:11:51,228
WHICH SOUNDS GREAT!

363
00:11:51,313 --> 00:11:53,348
YOU MAY HAVE EVEN SEEN THEM
BRAGGING ABOUT THEIR CLAIMS IN

364
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:55,044
ADS, LIKE THIS ONE FROM UNITED

365
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:59,191
AIRLINES, THIS ONE FROM APPLE,
THIS ONE FROM SHELL, AND THIS

366
00:11:59,276 --> 00:12:01,199
ONE FROM AN UNEXPECTED SOURCE.

367
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,660
>> KIT KAT IS COMMITTING TO

368
00:12:02,745 --> 00:12:04,762
BECOMING CARBON NEUTRAL BY

369
00:12:04,847 --> 00:12:07,926
2025, REDUCING EMISSIONS BY 50%

370
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,895
THROUGH FOREST REGENERATION,

371
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,051
PLANTING FIVE MILLION SHADE

372
00:12:12,136 --> 00:12:14,305
TREES, SUPPORTING REGENERATIVE

373
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,965
FARMING, AND SECURING 100%

374
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,191
RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY FOR OUR
FACTORIES WORLDWIDE.

375
00:12:20,276 --> 00:12:22,106
AND WE'LL OFFSET ANY REMAINING

376
00:12:22,191 --> 00:12:25,035
CARBON BY INVESTING IN CLIMATE
PROJECTS.

377
00:12:25,176 --> 00:12:27,238
LET'S GIVE THE PLANET A BREAK.

378
00:12:27,323 --> 00:12:29,231
>> John: YEAH, EVEN KIT KAT IS

379
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:30,634
GETTING INVOLVED.

380
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:32,419
WHICH IS A STRANGE SALES
TECHNIQUE.

381
00:12:32,504 --> 00:12:33,606
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU DECIDE TO EAT

382
00:12:33,691 --> 00:12:36,396
A KIT KAT BAR BECAUSE OF THEIR
NET ZERO TARGETS.

383
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:38,793
YOU DECIDE TO EAT ONE BECAUSE
YOU'RE AT ROCK BOTTOM AND YOU'RE

384
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:41,074
OUT OF
REESE'S PEANUT BUTTER CUPS.

385
00:12:42,285 --> 00:12:43,449
AS FOR THE SHOVEL MADE OUT OF A

386
00:12:43,551 --> 00:12:46,544
KIT KAT, THAT SEEMS LESS LIKE A
SUSTAINABLE FARMING TOOL

387
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:48,184
AND MORE LIKE WHAT YOU'D USE TO BURY

388
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:50,071
THE BODY OF THE RED M&M.

389
00:12:50,405 --> 00:12:52,641
BUT THE KEY PHRASING COMES AT

390
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,676
THE END THERE -- THAT THEY'D
"OFFSET ANY REMAINING CARBON".

391
00:12:55,878 --> 00:12:58,036
THAT'S ACTUALLY A COMMON TACTIC.

392
00:12:58,121 --> 00:13:01,075
IN FACT, ONE STUDY THAT LOOKED
CLOSELY AT THE NET-ZERO PROMISES

393
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,505
OF DOZENS OF COMPANIES IN

394
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,019
HEAVILY-POLLUTING INDUSTRIES

395
00:13:04,086 --> 00:13:05,825
FOUND THAT TWO-THIRDS OF THEM

396
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,989
ARE RELYING ON OFFSETS INSTEAD

397
00:13:08,074 --> 00:13:09,849
OF EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS.

398
00:13:09,934 --> 00:13:11,941
OFFSETS ARE WILDLY POPULAR --

399
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:15,097
EVEN BANDS HAVE PROMISED OVER
THE YEARS TO USE THEM TO REDUCE

400
00:13:15,246 --> 00:13:17,020
THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF
THEIR TOURS.

401
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:22,199
ALL THE GREATS -- DAVE MATTHEWS,
BON JOVI, COLDPLAY, AND EVEN

402
00:13:22,284 --> 00:13:25,152
SERGEANT PEPPER'S ANGSTY
VICTORIAN GHOST CLUB BAND:

403
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,006
MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE.

404
00:13:27,175 --> 00:13:28,566
>> A BIG TOUR LIKE THIS USES

405
00:13:28,651 --> 00:13:30,627
LOTS OF ENERGY: TRUCKS, VANS,

406
00:13:30,712 --> 00:13:31,947
LIGHTS, SOUND, AND MORE, AND

407
00:13:32,014 --> 00:13:34,049
THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON THE
ENVIRONMENT.

408
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:36,231
SO WE'VE PARTNERED UP WITH A
REALLY COOL NON-PROFIT

409
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:39,012
ORGANIZATION CALLED REVERB TO
HELP US GREEN THINGS UP.

410
00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:40,324
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY

411
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:42,810
DO IS FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH ENERGY
THE TOUR USES.

412
00:13:42,895 --> 00:13:44,520
THEN THEY INVEST IN ALTERNATIVE

413
00:13:44,605 --> 00:13:46,403
ENERGY PROJECTS TO HELP MAKE UP
FOR IT.

414
00:13:46,488 --> 00:13:47,895
>> John: COOL.

415
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:49,254
THANKS GUYS.

416
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:52,106
AND I ADMIT IT'S NICE TO SEE THEM
REPRESENT THEIR CORE FAN BASE:

417
00:13:52,191 --> 00:13:53,270
MIDDLE SCHOOLERS WHO HAVE TO

418
00:13:53,355 --> 00:13:55,893
GIVE A PRESENTATION IN FRONT OF
THE CLASS AGAINST THEIR WILL.

419
00:13:55,978 --> 00:13:59,675
BUT I DON'T PARTICULARLY CARE
FOR THE PHRASE "GREEN THINGS UP".

420
00:13:59,741 --> 00:14:00,876
IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING SHREK

421
00:14:00,943 --> 00:14:03,111
WOULD SAY RIGHT BEFORE HE
REACHES A SEXUAL CLIMAX.

422
00:14:03,178 --> 00:14:06,223
"LOOK OUT, I'M ABOUT TO GREEN
THINGS UP!

423
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:07,660
WATCH ME, DONKEH!"

424
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:10,910
I WANT YOU TO WATCH ME
LOOK ME IN THE EYES.

425
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,013
AND YET, IF THE IDEA THAT YOU

426
00:14:15,098 --> 00:14:16,858
CAN SIMPLY INVEST A LITTLE MONEY

427
00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:19,591
AND MAKE YOUR CARBON FOOTPRINT
DISAPPEAR SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE

428
00:14:19,676 --> 00:14:22,364
TRUE, THAT'S BECAUSE IT
ABSOLUTELY IS.

429
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:24,497
STUDY AFTER STUDY HAS INDICATED

430
00:14:24,582 --> 00:14:25,763
THAT MOST OFFSETS AVAILABLE ON

431
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:28,715
THE MARKET DON'T RELIABLY REDUCE
EMISSIONS.

432
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,572
AND YET, OFFSETS ARE NOW THE

433
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,848
BACKBONE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL

434
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:34,582
POLICIES OF MANY OF THE BIGGEST
POLLUTERS ON THE PLANET.

435
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:35,941
SO, GIVEN THAT, TONIGHT,

436
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:37,583
 LET'S TALK ABOUT CARBON OFFSETS.

437
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,147
WHAT THEY ARE, WHAT THEY CLAIM

438
00:14:39,214 --> 00:14:40,677
TO DO, AND HOW THEY MAY ACTUALLY

439
00:14:40,762 --> 00:14:42,017
BE MAKING THINGS EVEN WORSE.

440
00:14:42,084 --> 00:14:44,527
AND LET'S START WITH SOME BASIC
DEFINITIONS.

441
00:14:44,612 --> 00:14:46,099
THE IDEA OF A CARBON OFFSET IS

442
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:47,771
THAT, IF YOU EMIT CO2 INTO THE

443
00:14:47,856 --> 00:14:49,699
ATMOSPHERE, YOU CAN OFFSET IT

444
00:14:49,784 --> 00:14:51,453
BY, SAY, PLANTING OR PROTECTING

445
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,439
TREES, WHICH REMOVE CARBON FROM

446
00:14:53,562 --> 00:14:55,363
THE AIR, OR BUILDING A WIND FARM

447
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:57,049
TO REPLACE A FOSSIL FUEL PLANT.

448
00:14:57,134 --> 00:14:58,802
HERE'S HOW BP -- A MAJOR

449
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,303
POLLUTER, OF COURSE -- SELLS THE
IDEA.

450
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,035
>> I'VE BEEN DRIVING AROUND AND

451
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,458
GENERATING THREE TONS OF CARBON

452
00:15:05,543 --> 00:15:06,974
DIOXIDE, WHICH OF COURSE I'VE

453
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:08,877
RELEASED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE TO

454
00:15:08,944 --> 00:15:12,801
JOIN ALL THE REST OF THE GREENHOUSE
GASSES THAT ARE ALREADY OUT THERE.

455
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,036
NOW, IMAGINE THAT MILES AWAY,

456
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:17,056
MAYBE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

457
00:15:17,141 --> 00:15:19,516
WORLD, SOMEBODY ELSE TAKES THREE

458
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:21,161
TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE OUT OF

459
00:15:21,246 --> 00:15:22,624
THE ATMOSPHERE.

460
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:23,911
SO, WHAT'S HAPPENED?

461
00:15:23,996 --> 00:15:27,051
THREE TONS IN, THREE TONS OUT,

462
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,035
RESULT: ZERO.

463
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,926
>> John: THAT VIOLENTLY BRITISH

464
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:32,685
MAN DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF

465
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,910
ILLUSTRATING THE CONCEPT THERE.

466
00:15:33,995 --> 00:15:35,254
I'M NOT SURE HE NEEDED TO USE

467
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:37,762
THE DECORATIONS FROM A CLOWN'S
FUNERAL TO DO IT, BUT I GUESS,

468
00:15:37,847 --> 00:15:39,341
WITHOUT THEM, I'D NEVER HAVE

469
00:15:39,426 --> 00:15:40,324
KNOWN WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN

470
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:41,543
YOU ADD THREE TO SOMETHING BUT

471
00:15:41,628 --> 00:15:42,746
THEN TAKE THREE AWAY, IT SIMPLY

472
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:43,665
CAN'T BE DONE.

473
00:15:43,854 --> 00:15:47,091
BUT IF THAT SIMPLE EXPLANATION
DIDN'T DO IT FOR YOU, HERE'S ONE

474
00:15:47,176 --> 00:15:49,351
IDIOT EXPLAINING OFFSETS TO
ANOTHER IDIOT, USING THE WORST

475
00:15:49,418 --> 00:15:52,067
POSSIBLE METAPHOR, GIVEN WHO THE

476
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:53,655
SECOND IDIOT IS.

477
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,104
>> OF COURSE, YOU CAN BUY CARBON

478
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:56,396
OFFSETS, WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT

479
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:58,379
OF BUYING, YOU KNOW, A DIAMOND

480
00:15:58,464 --> 00:16:00,122
WATCH, RING, AND NECKLACE.

481
00:16:00,207 --> 00:16:02,074
IF YOU'RE UNFAITHFUL TO YOUR

482
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:03,331
WIFE AND SAY, 'OH IT'S JUST AN

483
00:16:03,398 --> 00:16:05,033
OFFSET HONEY, NO PROBLEM.'

484
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,574
THAT'LL WORK...

485
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:08,724
WHICH A CARBON OFFSET IS 'OH I

486
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:09,604
CAN SIN ALL I WANT.

487
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:11,406
I CAN PUT OUT ALL THE EMISSIONS

488
00:16:11,473 --> 00:16:12,699
I WANT-BUT YOU GOT TO GET RID OF

489
00:16:12,793 --> 00:16:14,106
YOUR CARAVAN AND DRIVE A

490
00:16:14,191 --> 00:16:15,060
BICYCLE.'

491
00:16:15,145 --> 00:16:16,699
>> John: OKAY, SET ASIDE

492
00:16:16,784 --> 00:16:18,129
HANNITY'S INABILITY TO DECIDE IF

493
00:16:18,214 --> 00:16:19,332
HE THINKS CARBON OFFESETS ARE

494
00:16:19,427 --> 00:16:20,841
LIKE BUYING YOUR WIFE A NECKLACE

495
00:16:20,926 --> 00:16:22,520
"OR" FORCING SOMEONE ELSE TO
RIDE A BIKE.

496
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:24,098
LET'S JUST DWELL ON HIM SAYING

497
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,638
THE WORDS, "IF YOU'RE UNFAITHFUL

498
00:16:25,723 --> 00:16:28,223
TO YOUR WIFE" TO NEWT GINGRICH,

499
00:16:28,308 --> 00:16:29,621
A MAN WHO WAS FAMOUSLY

500
00:16:29,761 --> 00:16:31,465
UNFAITHFUL TO "TWO" OF HIS THREE

501
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,707
WIVES, SO FAR, TRYING TO GET

502
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:35,066
ONE TO SIGN DIVORCE DOCUMENTS

503
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:35,952
WHILE SHE WAS RECOVERING FROM

504
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,544
CANCER SURGERY, AND ASKING THE

505
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:39,903
SECOND FOR A DIVORCE SHORTLY

506
00:16:39,988 --> 00:16:41,870
AFTER SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH
M.S.

507
00:16:41,937 --> 00:16:43,919
NO WONDER HE JUST SAT THERE
SILENTLY UNTIL HANNITY STARTED

508
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:44,809
SPEAKING AGAIN.

509
00:16:44,894 --> 00:16:46,231
I'M SURE HE DESPERATELY WANTED

510
00:16:46,316 --> 00:16:48,168
TO WALK OUT, BUT I GUESS NEWT

511
00:16:48,253 --> 00:16:49,588
WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO SEAN --

512
00:16:49,863 --> 00:16:51,396
HE ONLY DOES THAT TO PEOPLE WITH

513
00:16:51,481 --> 00:16:52,801
SEVERE ILLNESSES.

514
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,689
BUT THE POINT IS: OFFSETS ALLOW

515
00:16:55,774 --> 00:16:57,819
BUSINESSES THAT CAN'T
IMMEDIATELY "REDUCE" THEIR

516
00:16:57,886 --> 00:16:59,966
EMISSIONS TO BALANCE THINGS OUT

517
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:02,858
BY BUYING EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

518
00:17:02,943 --> 00:17:03,911
AND IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD,

519
00:17:03,996 --> 00:17:04,934
THEY'RE ACTUALLY A WAY TO MEET

520
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:07,247
REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ON
EMISSIONS.

521
00:17:07,332 --> 00:17:09,020
PLACES LIKE CHINA, KOREA,

522
00:17:09,105 --> 00:17:10,895
AUSTRALIA, AND CALIFORNIA HAVE

523
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,418
SET CAPS FOR HOW MUCH COMPANIES
CAN EMIT.

524
00:17:13,503 --> 00:17:15,403
AND IF YOU GO ABOVE THAT CAP,

525
00:17:15,495 --> 00:17:18,590
YOU MIGHT OPT TO BUY AN OFFSET
TO GET BACK BELOW IT.

526
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:22,060
BUT COMPANIES OPERATING OUTSIDE
OF THOSE AREAS MIGHT STILL

527
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:25,013
CHOOSE TO BUY OFFSETS
VOLUNTARILY, SO THEY CAN

528
00:17:25,098 --> 00:17:28,327
MAKE CLAIMS LIKE THE ONES YOU
SAW EARLIER IN THOSE ADS.

529
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:29,935
THE VOLUNTARY MARKET IS SMALLER,

530
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,207
BUT IT'S GROWING INCREDIBLY FAST

531
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:36,348
-- IT QUADRUPLED TO NEARLY TWO
BILLION DOLLARS IN 2021.

532
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:38,185
EVEN YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL CAN

533
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,402
NOW BE SOLD OFFSETS.

534
00:17:39,487 --> 00:17:42,895
YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN CHECKBOXES
LIKE THESE ON SITES LIKE UPS,

535
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,676
OFFERING YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO
OFFSET THE CARBON OF YOUR

536
00:17:45,761 --> 00:17:47,145
DELIVERY, OR MAYBE YOU WERE

537
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,277
OFFERED ONE AS AN IMPULSE BUY
WHILE TRAVELING.

538
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:53,099
>> TRAVELERS THROUGH AUSTIN'S
AIRPORT CAN HELP OFFSET THE

539
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:55,208
EMISSIONS THEIR FLIGHTS PUT INTO

540
00:17:55,293 --> 00:17:56,255
THE ATMOSPHERE.

541
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,786
IT ONLY COSTS $2 AND OFFSETS

542
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:01,473
MORE THAN 1,000 MILES OF AIR
TRAVEL.

543
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:03,660
>> John: THAT PRICE IS OBVIOUSLY
TOO LOW.

544
00:18:03,824 --> 00:18:05,629
IT'S PRETTY SUSPICIOUS THAT YOU

545
00:18:05,714 --> 00:18:07,285
COULD WALK INTO AN AIRPORT, AND

546
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,074
OFFSET MORE THAN A THOUSAND
MILES OF AIR TRAVEL FOR JUST TWO

547
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:13,628
DOLLARS, THEN HEAD OVER TO A
CIBO EXPRESS WHERE IT COSTS AT

548
00:18:13,695 --> 00:18:16,738
LEAST FIVE TIMES THAT TO BUY A
SOGGY CHICKEN WRAP THAT SOMEHOW

549
00:18:16,823 --> 00:18:20,738
LOOKS -- IF I HAD TO PICK ONE
DESCRIPTOR FOR IT -- RECENTLY DIVORCED.

550
00:18:21,107 --> 00:18:22,457
THERE ARE EVEN BOUTIQUE

551
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:24,426
COMPANIES POPPING UP, LIKE

552
00:18:24,573 --> 00:18:26,356
"WORLD'S FIRST HUMAN BREATH

553
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:27,824
CARBON OFFSET SERVICE,"

554
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:31,535
WHERE YOU CAN, FOR SEVENTEEN
DOLLARS A YEAR, OFFSET YOUR OWN BREATH.

555
00:18:31,703 --> 00:18:33,205
AND IF YOU JUST LET OUT A HUGE

556
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,793
EXASPERATED SIGH AT HEARING

557
00:18:34,878 --> 00:18:38,223
THAT, BAD NEWS: THAT'LL COST
EXTRA.

558
00:18:38,308 --> 00:18:41,746
YEP, YOU ALSO OFFERS YOU THE
CHANCE TO OFFSET YOUR PETS,

559
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,020
RANGING FROM $.06 FOR A HAMSTER

560
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:48,590
TO $6 FOR A CAT, ALL THE WAY TO
$10 TO OFFSET YOUR PIG.

561
00:18:48,675 --> 00:18:50,723
WHICH SEEMS GREAT, ASIDE FROM

562
00:18:50,808 --> 00:18:52,115
THE FACT THAT "$10 TO OFFSET

563
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,098
YOUR PIG" SOUNDS LIKE A DUTCH

564
00:18:54,183 --> 00:18:56,239
SEX ACT THAT WAS SENT BACK AND

565
00:18:56,324 --> 00:18:57,481
FORTH THROUGH GOOGLE TRANSLATE

566
00:18:57,566 --> 00:18:59,027
ONE TOO MANY TIMES.

567
00:18:59,112 --> 00:19:01,309
"FOR $10, BASILIUS, HE OFFSET

568
00:19:01,394 --> 00:19:03,162
YOUR PIG, SO GOOD, SO STRONG,

569
00:19:03,378 --> 00:19:06,316
YOUR EYES WILL POP AND YOUR
BRAVE TESTICLES WILL SWITCH."

570
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:10,035
SO WHILE DOING THIS
WE REALLY OFFSET UP PIG.

571
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:13,216
AND LOOK: ON SOME LEVEL, YOU

572
00:19:13,301 --> 00:19:15,551
PROBABLY KNOW CARBON OFFSETS ARE
BULLSHIT.

573
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:19,051
BOTH BECAUSE YOU'RE A REASONABLY
INTELLIGENT PERSON AND BECAUSE

574
00:19:19,136 --> 00:19:21,731
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT SHOW
YOU'RE WATCHING RIGHT NOW.

575
00:19:21,816 --> 00:19:23,762
I DON'T OPEN MY BEAK TO SQUAWK

576
00:19:23,847 --> 00:19:26,816
OUT GOOD NEWS; THIS THING POPS

577
00:19:26,901 --> 00:19:28,318
OPEN FOR SAD NEWS AND PORRIDGE,

578
00:19:28,403 --> 00:19:30,707
AND I'M ALL OUT OF PORRIDGE
RIGHT NOW.

579
00:19:30,985 --> 00:19:33,354
BUT EXACTLY HOW THEY'RE BULLSHIT

580
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,856
IS INTERESTING.

581
00:19:34,949 --> 00:19:36,637
BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO SAY

582
00:19:36,722 --> 00:19:38,134
YOU'RE REDUCING CARBON

583
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,987
EMISSIONS, BUT IT'S MUCH HARDER

584
00:19:40,072 --> 00:19:41,840
TO PROVE IT, AND THE TRUTH IS,

585
00:19:41,926 --> 00:19:45,053
THERE AREN'T MANY CHECKS AND
BALANCES IN PLACE TO PREVENT ABUSE.

586
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,888
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT
THAT A KEY CRITERION FOR ANY

587
00:19:48,973 --> 00:19:50,403
OFFSET PROJECT IS WHAT'S CALLED

588
00:19:50,488 --> 00:19:51,559
"ADDITIONALITY."

589
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:52,863
THE IDEA IS THAT AN OFFSET

590
00:19:52,948 --> 00:19:54,535
SHOULD PROVIDE AN "EXTRA"

591
00:19:54,629 --> 00:19:58,066
REDUCTION OF CARBON, THAT WOULDN'T
HAVE HAPPENED ANY OTHER WAY.

592
00:19:58,133 --> 00:20:00,669
FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU PLANTED A
TREE THAT WOULDN'T OTHERWISE

593
00:20:00,754 --> 00:20:03,020
HAVE BEEN PLANTED, THAT'S
ADDITIONAL.

594
00:20:03,138 --> 00:20:05,060
AS IS SAVING A TREE THAT WOULD

595
00:20:05,145 --> 00:20:06,724
OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN.

596
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:08,879
BUT THERE ARE MANY CASES WHERE

597
00:20:08,964 --> 00:20:10,872
THE CLAIM OF "ADDITIONALITY" IS

598
00:20:10,972 --> 00:20:12,480
SHAKY, AT BEST.

599
00:20:12,571 --> 00:20:15,051
TAKE J.P. MORGAN, WHICH
ANNOUNCED IT HAD ACHIEVED

600
00:20:15,136 --> 00:20:18,801
"CARBON NEUTRALITY" ACROSS ITS
OPERATIONS IN 2020.

601
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,918
ONE OF THE WAYS IT CLAIMED TO
HAVE ELIMINATED ITS CARBON

602
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:24,871
FOOTPRINT IS BY BUYING A MILLION
DOLLARS WORTH OF OFFSETS,

603
00:20:25,043 --> 00:20:27,488
CLAIMING TO PROTECT AN AREA IN
PENNSYLVANIA CALLED

604
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:29,138
HAWK MOUNTAIN SANCTUARY.

605
00:20:29,238 --> 00:20:32,208
BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THE
THREATS TO THE SANCTUARY WERE

606
00:20:32,293 --> 00:20:33,568
WILDLY OVERBLOWN.

607
00:20:33,635 --> 00:20:36,121
>> THIS IS THE PROJECT'S
PLANNING DOCUMENT SUBMITTED IN

608
00:20:36,206 --> 00:20:37,552
2018 TO THE AMERICAN CARBON

609
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,207
REGISTRY, AND THIS IS THE

610
00:20:39,274 --> 00:20:41,710
BASELINE THE PROJECT'S BUILT
UPON -- THAT IF IT WEREN'T FOR

611
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:42,997
INTERVENTION, THE FORESTS WILL

612
00:20:43,082 --> 00:20:44,546
BE SUBJECT TO AGGRESSIVE

613
00:20:44,612 --> 00:20:46,281
CLEAR-CUTTING AND HIGH GRADING.

614
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:49,809
THE PROBLEM WAS HAWK MOUNTAIN
PRESERVE, AS ITS NAME WOULD

615
00:20:49,894 --> 00:20:54,395
SUGGEST, WAS ALREADY A PRESERVE.
SINCE THE 1930S.

616
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,859
THIS AREA HAS BEEN CLOSELY LOOKED
AFTER, MANAGED, AND PROTECTED.

617
00:20:57,926 --> 00:20:59,739
THE FOREST DIDN'T NEED SAVING.

618
00:20:59,824 --> 00:21:01,196
IT WASN'T UNDER THREAT.

619
00:21:01,262 --> 00:21:03,264
>> John: YEAH, OF COURSE IT
WASN'T.

620
00:21:03,331 --> 00:21:05,700
AND THAT PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE
BEEN OBVIOUS FROM THE FACT IT

621
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:07,832
WAS A PRESERVE, AND NOT CALLED

622
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,707
THE "HAWK MOUNTAIN CHOP-CHOP
ZONE AND TREE MURDER PLAYGROUND".

623
00:21:11,902 --> 00:21:13,324
AS A REPORTER FROM BLOOMBERG

624
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:16,324
UNCOVERED, THAT OFFSET WAS SOLD
TO J.P. MORGAN BY THE NATURE

625
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:17,644
CONSERVANCY, WHICH HAS BEEN VERY

626
00:21:17,729 --> 00:21:20,238
ACTIVE IN SELLING CARBON OFFSET
PROJECTS.

627
00:21:20,323 --> 00:21:23,051
THEY ALSO SOLD ONE HUNDRED AND
EIGHTY THOUSAND CREDITS TO

628
00:21:23,118 --> 00:21:24,863
DISNEY, WHICH OSTENSIBLY WENT TO

629
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:27,598
PROTECT THIS FOREST IN RURAL
PENNSYLVANIA FROM WHAT THE

630
00:21:27,683 --> 00:21:31,693
CONSERVANCY WARNED WAS A RISK OF
SIGNIFICANT COMMERCIAL TIMBER HARVESTING.

631
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,394
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW: THE NATURE
CONSERVANCY ITSELF HAD OWNED

632
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:37,707
MOST OF THAT LAND SINCE 1999.

633
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:39,160
AND THEY'RE NOT, FAMOUSLY, IN

634
00:21:39,245 --> 00:21:42,704
THE COMMERCIAL TIMBER HARVESTING
BUSINESS.

635
00:21:42,771 --> 00:21:44,543
AND YOU MIGHT THINK, "WELL, GOOD
FOR THEM.

636
00:21:44,628 --> 00:21:45,696
THEY'RE TAKING DISNEY'S MONEY,

637
00:21:45,874 --> 00:21:47,008
AND NOT HAVING TO GIVE THEM

638
00:21:47,075 --> 00:21:48,009
ANYTHING IN RETURN."

639
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,111
BUT THEY ARE GIVING THEM

640
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:51,246
SOMETHING, THOUGH -- NAMELY, THE

641
00:21:51,312 --> 00:21:53,081
ABILITY TO MAKE CLAIMS LIKE,

642
00:21:53,148 --> 00:21:56,605
"DISNEY REDUCED OVER 4 MILLION
TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE, EQUAL TO

643
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,621
TAKING OVER 900,000 CARS OFF THE
ROAD."

644
00:21:59,687 --> 00:22:02,020
WHICH WE ALREADY KNOW ISN'T TRUE

645
00:22:02,105 --> 00:22:03,758
BUT, IF IT WERE, I DO HOPE THEY

646
00:22:03,825 --> 00:22:05,269
WOULD START WITH MATER.

647
00:22:05,354 --> 00:22:07,519
I DON'T CARE IF HE'S LIGHTNING

648
00:22:07,604 --> 00:22:09,363
McQUEEN'S BEST FRIEND,
HE'S CHOKING US.

649
00:22:09,448 --> 00:22:11,717
HE'S CHOKING OUR PLANET TO
DEATH.

650
00:22:12,777 --> 00:22:14,551
ALSO THE MONEY FROM OFFSETS

651
00:22:14,636 --> 00:22:16,317
DOESN'T ALWAYS GO TO PLACES LIKE

652
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:17,683
THE NATURE CONSERVANCY.

653
00:22:17,768 --> 00:22:19,238
REMEMBER THAT AIRPORT PLAN WHERE

654
00:22:19,323 --> 00:22:20,480
YOU COULD OFFSET MORE THAN A

655
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:22,566
THOUSAND MILES OF AIR TRAVEL FOR
$2?

656
00:22:22,651 --> 00:22:26,488
RECORDS SHOW THAT THIS YEAR, A
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE MONEY

657
00:22:26,573 --> 00:22:28,683
FROM THAT PROGRAM HAS GONE TO
SUPPORT TREES AT THE

658
00:22:28,768 --> 00:22:30,317
"HUDSON FARM CLUB," IN NEW

659
00:22:30,402 --> 00:22:32,762
JERSEY, A 3,800-ACRE PRIVATE

660
00:22:32,847 --> 00:22:34,130
HUNTING CLUB SET UP BY

661
00:22:34,215 --> 00:22:36,152
PETER KELLOGG -- BILLIONAIRE AND

662
00:22:36,237 --> 00:22:37,582
MODEL FOR THE L.L. BEAN "HEART

663
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:39,574
FAILURE AT THE YACHT CLUB"
COLLECTION.

664
00:22:39,676 --> 00:22:41,192
HERE'S ONE MEMBER EXPLAINING

665
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,530
WHAT HAPPENS THERE.

666
00:22:42,597 --> 00:22:45,166
>> PETER HAD THIS VISION OF

667
00:22:45,418 --> 00:22:48,102
HAVING A PLACE FOR SEVERAL OF

668
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:50,262
HIS FRIENDS AND ADDITIONAL
MEMBERS TO HUNT IN NEW JERSEY

669
00:22:50,347 --> 00:22:55,551
AND TO SHOOT IN NEW JERSEY AND
TO DEVELOP ONE OF THE BEST

670
00:22:55,738 --> 00:22:59,933
SPORTING CLAYS SPOTS IN THE
WHOLE NORTHEAST, IF NOT THE COUNTRY.

671
00:23:00,018 --> 00:23:01,575
IT'S CALLED HUDSON FARM.

672
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,341
IT'S APPROXIMATELY 3800 ACRES.

673
00:23:03,426 --> 00:23:04,853
IT'S IN ANDOVER, NEW JERSEY.

674
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:07,926
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
PLACES ON EARTH I'VE EVER SEEN.

675
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,567
AND IT IS A HUNTERS' AND

676
00:23:09,652 --> 00:23:10,825
SHOOTERS' PARADISE.

677
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:11,683
>> John: OKAY.

678
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,927
FIRST, IT'S NOT JUST ME, WE'RE

679
00:23:14,012 --> 00:23:16,855
GETTING STRONG "GET OUT" VIBES
FROM. IS IT RIGHT?

680
00:23:16,856 --> 00:23:18,214
ITS NOT JUST MADE

681
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:22,138
SECOND, THE HUDSON FARM CLUB
AND THE CARBON COMPANY BLUE SOURCE

682
00:23:22,223 --> 00:23:26,051
CLAIMED WITHOUT THE
MONEY FROM CARBON OFFSETS, 77%

683
00:23:26,136 --> 00:23:29,324
OF THE TREES COULD BE CLEAR-CUT
IN JUST FIVE YEARS.

684
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,473
BUT THAT CLEARLY WASN'T GOING TO
HAPPEN.

685
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:34,723
IT'S OWNED BY A BILLIONAIRE, AND
EXISTS FOR RICH GUYS TO

686
00:23:34,808 --> 00:23:37,738
FANTASIZE ABOUT SHOOTING ANIMALS
IN THE WILD, RIGHT DOWN TO

687
00:23:37,823 --> 00:23:40,004
THIS LIFE-SIZED CARDBOARD CUTOUT

688
00:23:40,089 --> 00:23:42,519
OF A BUFFALO ON FOUR WHEELS.

689
00:23:42,824 --> 00:23:45,754
IN FACT, I'D ARGUE THE ONLY REAL
DAMAGE THAT MIGHT HAPPEN THERE

690
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:48,897
IS FROM THAT GUY YOU SAW TALKING
EARLIER, WHO SEEMS IN DANGER OF

691
00:23:48,963 --> 00:23:51,176
CASUALLY SHOOTING OFF HIS OWN
NUTSACK.

692
00:23:52,085 --> 00:23:53,427
AND WITH THE MARKET FOR CARBON

693
00:23:53,527 --> 00:23:56,644
OFFSETS INCREASING, AND NOW THE COMPANIES
ARE ACTIVELY RECRUITING

694
00:23:56,729 --> 00:24:00,426
ALMOST ANYONE WHO HAS
A TREE, TO GET IN ON THE ACTION.

695
00:24:00,511 --> 00:24:02,824
FIRMS LIKE THESE ARE IN THE
BUSINESS OF FINDING SMALL

696
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:05,809
LANDOWNERS AND CONNECTING THEM
WITH COMPANIES WHO'LL PAY THEM

697
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:07,230
NOT TO CUT DOWN THEIR TREES,

698
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:10,340
PITCHING THEMSELVES WITH
LIKE THIS ONE FROM NCX.

699
00:24:10,457 --> 00:24:13,441
>> WE'RE IN A CRITICAL DECADE
FOR THE CLIMATE AND FORESTS ARE

700
00:24:13,526 --> 00:24:16,715
A POWERFUL NATURAL SOLUTION FOR
REMOVING CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE.

701
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,598
NCX'S FOREST DATA SCIENTISTS

702
00:24:18,683 --> 00:24:21,036
DEVELOPED THE FIRST
HIGH-RESOLUTION FOREST MAP OF

703
00:24:21,121 --> 00:24:22,427
EVERY ACRE OF AMERICA.

704
00:24:22,512 --> 00:24:25,199
NOW, EVERY LANDOWNER AND
EVERY ACRE OF FOREST CAN BE PART

705
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:26,949
OF THE CLIMATE SOLUTION.

706
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:28,102
>> John: YEAH, BASICALLY,

707
00:24:28,187 --> 00:24:30,204
THEY'LL PAY YOU TO LEAVE YOUR
TREES ALONE.

708
00:24:30,271 --> 00:24:31,567
WHICH IS A PRETTY GOOD DEAL, AS

709
00:24:31,652 --> 00:24:33,177
IT SHOULD BE EASY NOT TO CUT

710
00:24:33,262 --> 00:24:34,903
DOWN TREES, UNLESS, OF COURSE,

711
00:24:34,988 --> 00:24:36,317
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS ONE.

712
00:24:36,402 --> 00:24:38,446
BECAUSE **** THIS TREE.

713
00:24:38,513 --> 00:24:39,997
IT HAS AT LEAST SEVEN DIFFERENT

714
00:24:40,082 --> 00:24:42,340
EYES, "TEETH", AND IT SEEMS TO

715
00:24:42,425 --> 00:24:43,723
BE VOMITING UP A BUSH.

716
00:24:43,808 --> 00:24:44,986
YOU LOOK LIKE THE GIVING TREE IF

717
00:24:45,053 --> 00:24:48,121
ALL IT GAVE YOU WAS NIGHTMARES
H.P. LOVECRAFT.

718
00:24:48,206 --> 00:24:50,410
I HATE THIS TREE!

719
00:24:50,495 --> 00:24:52,535
AND WITH NCX, YOU DON'T EVEN

720
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,308
HAVE TO PROMISE "NEVER" TO CUT

721
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:56,564
YOUR TREES DOWN, AS THEY GIVE
YOU THE OPTION TO STILL GET PAID

722
00:24:56,631 --> 00:25:00,715
SIMPLY TO DEFER CUTTING THEM
DOWN FOR "AS LITTLE AS ONE YEAR."

723
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,202
BUT A TWELVE-MONTH DELAY DOESN'T

724
00:25:02,287 --> 00:25:04,220
REALLY BENEFIT THE PLANET MUCH.

725
00:25:04,305 --> 00:25:07,223
AS ONE EXPERT WE TALKED TO
FRAMED IT, IT'S AKIN TO SELLING

726
00:25:07,308 --> 00:25:08,848
A CARBON CREDIT FOR HOLDING YOUR

727
00:25:08,933 --> 00:25:10,380
BREATH FOR FIFTEEN SECONDS.

728
00:25:10,465 --> 00:25:11,763
ALSO, THERE'S A MUCH BIGGER

729
00:25:11,848 --> 00:25:14,138
PROBLEM WITH ALL THESE
TREE-BASED PROGRAMS, WHICH IS

730
00:25:14,223 --> 00:25:16,168
THAT EVEN THEY DO PROTECT ONE

731
00:25:16,253 --> 00:25:18,013
SECTION OF TREES FROM LOGGING,

732
00:25:18,098 --> 00:25:19,747
THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN

733
00:25:19,832 --> 00:25:23,070
MUCH, IF A LOGGING OPERATION
SIMPLY CUTS DOWN THE TREES ON

734
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:24,865
THE LAND NEXT DOOR INSTEAD.

735
00:25:24,932 --> 00:25:26,051
PLUS, GIVEN THAT

736
00:25:26,136 --> 00:25:27,707
FOREST FIRES ARE NOW ON THE RISE

737
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:28,996
THANKS TO CLIMATE CHANGE, OFFSET

738
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,872
PROGRAMS CAN, AND HAVE,

739
00:25:30,957 --> 00:25:33,535
LITERALLY GONE UP IN FLAMES.

740
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,035
ALL OF THIS IS WHY, WHILE
COMPANIES LOVE TO MAKE BIG,

741
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,488
BROAD CLAIMS ABOUT THE BENEFITS
OF THEIR OFFSETS, THEY REALLY

742
00:25:39,573 --> 00:25:41,652
DON'T LIKE GETTING INTO THE
DETAILS.

743
00:25:41,744 --> 00:25:44,613
TAKE THE AIRLINE A FEW YEARS
AGO, THEY BEGAN A

744
00:25:44,698 --> 00:25:47,019
VOLUNTARY PROGRAM WHERE
CUSTOMERS COULD CONTRIBUTE ONE

745
00:25:47,104 --> 00:25:50,023
EURO TO HELP OFFSET THEIR
FLIGHT, POINTING TO

746
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,525
TREE-PLANTING SCHEMES IN IRELAND

747
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:53,613
AND PORTUGAL THAT WOULD HELP DO
THAT.

748
00:25:53,698 --> 00:25:55,137
BUT AN EXPERT LATER FOUND

749
00:25:55,222 --> 00:26:00,043
THOSE SCHEMES OFFSET LESS THAN
0.01 PERCENT OF RYANAIR'S 2019

750
00:26:00,128 --> 00:26:01,902
EMISSIONS -- AND WHEN ITS CEO

751
00:26:01,987 --> 00:26:04,683
WAS PRESSED ON THIS, HE GOT A
LITTLE DEFENSIVE.

752
00:26:04,808 --> 00:26:06,794
>> THE POINT HERE IS THAT YOU'VE

753
00:26:06,879 --> 00:26:10,973
GOT A LARGE AND GROWING AIRLINE THAT EMITS
A LOT OF CARBON DIOXIDE AND YOUR OFFSETTING

754
00:26:11,058 --> 00:26:12,965
SCHEME NOWHERE NEAR MEETS THAT.

755
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,785
>> ABSOLUTELY WRONG!

756
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:19,004
>> BUT THERE'S AN IRISH FOREST,
ISN'T THERE, IN ROSCOMMON?

757
00:26:19,089 --> 00:26:19,980
>> YEP.

758
00:26:20,065 --> 00:26:21,422
>> WHICH IS 7 HECTARES.

759
00:26:21,507 --> 00:26:23,230
I MEAN, IT IS NOTHING.

760
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,780
>> FROM LITTLE ACORNS GROW
MIGHTY TREES.

761
00:26:25,865 --> 00:26:27,726
>> IF YOU'VE ONLY GOT 7
HECTARES, YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO

762
00:26:27,811 --> 00:26:29,343
GET 7 HECTARES OF MIGHTY OAKS

763
00:26:29,428 --> 00:26:30,070
AREN'T YOU?

764
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,101
>> WE'VE ONLY STARTED THIS IN
THE LAST YEAR.

765
00:26:31,186 --> 00:26:32,616
I MEAN, WE'RE WORKING WITH FOUR
PROJECTS.

766
00:26:32,701 --> 00:26:37,007
WE'RE RE -- YOU KNOW, WE'RE REPLANTING
TREES IN MONCHIQUE IN PORTUGAL.

767
00:26:37,092 --> 00:26:38,605
WE'RE SUPPORTING WHALES AND

768
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,585
- DOLPHINS IN IRELAND AS WELL.
- >> WHALE TRACKING

769
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,209
WHICH HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH CARBON DIOXIDE.

770
00:26:42,294 --> 00:26:44,235
>> - AND THE BIZARRE ONE
>>-  WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH CARBON DIOXIDE.

771
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,460
>> NO, BUT IT'S GOOD FOR THE
ENVIRONMENT.

772
00:26:45,545 --> 00:26:47,904
I DON'T THINK ANY OF OUR
CUSTOMERS WOULD OBJECT TO

773
00:26:47,989 --> 00:26:50,123
SUPPORTING WHALES AND DOLPHINS
IN IRELAND.

774
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:51,591
>> John: OKAY, IT'S NOT THAT

775
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:52,644
PEOPLE WOULD OBJECT TO THAT.

776
00:26:52,729 --> 00:26:55,005
OF COURSE PEOPLE LOVE WHALES AND
DOLPHINS.

777
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,029
WHALES ARE BIG HONKIN' BOYS WHO

778
00:26:57,114 --> 00:26:58,474
UPSHIT WATER OUT OF THEIR HEADS,

779
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,818
AND DOLPHINS ARE SMOOTH,

780
00:26:59,903 --> 00:27:02,521
FRIENDLY WATER DOGS WHO CACKLE
LIKE DEMONIC BABIES -- THEY'RE

781
00:27:02,606 --> 00:27:03,834
BOTH EXCELLENT.

782
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,763
BUT PROTECTING THEM ISN'T THE
THING YOU PROMISED.

783
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:09,099
IT'S LIKE IF YOU ASKED YOUR
HUSBAND TO PICK UP YOUR KIDS

784
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,154
FROM SCHOOL AND HE CAME HOME
CHILDLESS, BUT WITH A PIZZA.

785
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,724
YOU'RE NOT MAD AT THE PIZZA --

786
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:15,404
NO ONE'S EVER MAD AT THE PIZZA

787
00:27:15,489 --> 00:27:18,748
BUT IT'S NOT THE IMPORTANT
THING HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO.

788
00:27:19,244 --> 00:27:20,959
THE PROBLEM WITH CARBON OFFSETS

789
00:27:21,044 --> 00:27:23,662
IS, EVERYONE WANTS TO BELIEVE IN
THEM.

790
00:27:23,834 --> 00:27:27,821
BUYERS WANT A CHEAP WAY TO MAKE
A BIG CLAIM, AND SELLERS WANT

791
00:27:27,888 --> 00:27:29,857
MONEY FOR DOING AS LITTLE AS
POSSIBLE.

792
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:32,326
AND IDEALLY, THERE WOULD BE AN
ENTITY IN THE MIDDLE

793
00:27:32,411 --> 00:27:34,608
CHARGED WITH KEEPING BOTH SIDES HONEST.

794
00:27:34,693 --> 00:27:38,021
AND THERE ACTUALLY IS -- THEY'RE
CALLED CARBON OFFSET REGISTRIES.

795
00:27:38,106 --> 00:27:41,735
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE NEUTRAL
THIRD PARTIES WHO SIGN OFF ON

796
00:27:41,802 --> 00:27:43,802
THE EFFICACY OF POTENTIAL
OFFSETS.

797
00:27:43,887 --> 00:27:45,795
THESE FOUR ARE THE MAJOR ONES IN

798
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,576
THE VOLUNTARY OFFSET MARKET.

799
00:27:47,661 --> 00:27:51,045
BUT THOSE REGISTRIES AREN'T
REALLY ACCOUNTABLE TO ANYONE --

800
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:54,348
TECHNICALLY, YOU OR I COULD
START A REGISTRY.

801
00:27:54,414 --> 00:27:56,116
AND GIVEN THAT THEY'RE PAID BY

802
00:27:56,183 --> 00:27:59,013
THE COMPANIES SELLING THE
OFFSETS, IT WON'T SURPRISE YOU

803
00:27:59,098 --> 00:28:02,701
TO LEARN MANY EXPERTS SAY
THEIR STANDARDS ARE FAR TOO LOW

804
00:28:02,788 --> 00:28:04,646
-- AS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE FACT

805
00:28:04,731 --> 00:28:08,186
THE HAWK MOUNTAIN PRESERVE, THE
DISNEY FOREST, AND THE HUNTING

806
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:09,710
CLUB, ALL MET THE STANDARDS

807
00:28:09,795 --> 00:28:11,665
OF THE AMERICAN CARBON REGISTRY.

808
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:14,529
BASICALLY, GETTING A SIGN OFF
FROM A CARBON REGISTRY IS LIKE

809
00:28:14,614 --> 00:28:16,449
WINNING A KIDS CHOICE AWARD --

810
00:28:16,534 --> 00:28:19,576
IT DOESN'T REALLY MEAN MUCH, BUT
IT WILL HELP YOU TEMPORARILY

811
00:28:19,661 --> 00:28:22,045
LOOK A LITTLE GREENER.

812
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:25,312
AND LOOK: THE PROBLEM ISN'T
THOSE PROJECTS THEMSELVES.

813
00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:27,880
IT'S GOOD TO PROTECT FORESTS!

814
00:28:27,965 --> 00:28:31,518
BUT THE ISSUE IS CLAIMING THEY
CANCEL OUT CARBON EMISSIONS.

815
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:35,373
BECAUSE TRULY OFFSETTING CARBON
IS TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE.

816
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:37,421
THEORETICALLY, IF A WIND FARM

817
00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:38,763
GETS BUILT TO REPLACE A

818
00:28:38,848 --> 00:28:41,147
FOSSIL-FUEL PLANT, THAT HAD ZERO

819
00:28:41,232 --> 00:28:46,255
LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING BUILT OTHERWISE,
THAT COULD BE A GENUINE OFFSET.

820
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,916
BUT REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES OF THAT

821
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:50,070
ARE EXTREMELY HARD TO FIND.

822
00:28:50,137 --> 00:28:51,655
ONE STUDY OF WIND TURBINE

823
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,537
PROJECTS IN INDIA, FOR INSTANCE,
FOUND THAT AT LEAST FIFTY-TWO

824
00:28:54,622 --> 00:28:56,318
PERCENT OF APPROVED CARBON

825
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:57,935
OFFSETS STEMMED FROM PROJECTS

826
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,521
THAT WOULD VERY LIKELY HAVE BEEN
BUILT ANYWAY.

827
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:01,755
WHICH CAUSES REAL DAMAGE.

828
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,607
BECAUSE POLLUTERS IN COUNTRIES THAT
CAP EMISSIONS BOUGHT THOSE OFFSETS.

829
00:29:05,692 --> 00:29:07,537
AND WHEN YOU BUY AN OFFSET SO

830
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:09,232
YOU CAN POLLUTE MORE -- AND THAT

831
00:29:09,317 --> 00:29:11,553
OFFSET IS BULLSHIT -- YOU'RE

832
00:29:11,638 --> 00:29:13,029
ACTIVELY MAKING THINGS WORSE.

833
00:29:13,114 --> 00:29:15,802
IN FACT, THAT STUDY ARGUES
THE SALE OF THOSE OFFSETS

834
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,849
SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED GLOBAL

835
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:19,235
CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS.

836
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,857
WHICH CLEARLY ISN'T GOOD.

837
00:29:21,951 --> 00:29:25,585
AND THERE'S ONE FINAL WAY CARBON
OFFSETS CAN CAUSE HARM.

838
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,638
BECAUSE WHEN THAT
BP SPOKESPERSON WITH THE GOTH

839
00:29:27,723 --> 00:29:31,271
BALLOONS REFERRED TO BUILDING AN
OFFSETTING PROJECT "MILES AWAY,

840
00:29:31,356 --> 00:29:35,582
MAYBE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
WORLD", IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING

841
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,365
THAT PEOPLE MIGHT BE LIVING
THERE.

842
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:40,099
A DECADE AGO, THE SWEDISH ENERGY
AGENCY ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD

843
00:29:40,184 --> 00:29:41,482
BOUGHT CARBON CREDITS FROM A

844
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:43,358
COMPANY CALLED GREEN RESOURCES,

845
00:29:43,443 --> 00:29:44,591
WHICH SAID IT HAD PLANTED

846
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,498
PINE FORESTS IN UGANDA, THAT

847
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:49,029
COULD OFFSET CARBON EMISSIONS
ELSEWHERE.

848
00:29:49,095 --> 00:29:51,076
THE PROBLEM WAS, THOUSANDS OF

849
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:53,099
RURAL UGANDANS WERE EVICTED BY

850
00:29:53,193 --> 00:29:55,101
THE UGANDAN GOVERNMENT TO MAKE

851
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,279
ROOM FOR THE PLANTATION,

852
00:29:56,364 --> 00:29:57,832
INCLUDING THIS MAN, WHOSE FAMILY

853
00:29:57,917 --> 00:30:00,201
ONCE FARMED A LARGE PLOT OF LAND
THERE.

854
00:30:01,488 --> 00:30:04,043
>> WHEN I WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD, I
STARTED HERDING CATTLE.

855
00:30:04,258 --> 00:30:07,062
THE OTHER KIDS AND I HERDED THE
LIVESTOCK ON OUR LAND.

856
00:30:07,147 --> 00:30:09,609
THERE WERE ROCKS, WHICH WERE
REMNANTS FROM MY GREAT GREAT

857
00:30:09,694 --> 00:30:11,038
GRANDFATHER'S DAY.

858
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:15,195
>> Narrator: ODONGO, DO YOU HAVE
A POSSIBILITY TO JUST SHOW US

859
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,124
WHERE YOUR LAND WAS?

860
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:18,718
>> NO, THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM.

861
00:30:18,803 --> 00:30:20,976
I CAN GET IN TROUBLE
IF I SHOW YOU THE LAND.

862
00:30:21,061 --> 00:30:22,874
>> John: THAT'S OBVIOUSLY AWFUL.

863
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:26,218
NO ONE SHOULD EVER BE SCARED
TO SHOW SOMEONE A PIECE OF LAND,

864
00:30:26,303 --> 00:30:29,820
UNLESS, OF COURSE, THAT ****ING JANKY
TREE IS ON IT.

865
00:30:29,905 --> 00:30:33,202
IF THERE WERE ANY SQUIRRELS
LIVING IN YOU, THEY'VE DIED OF

866
00:30:33,287 --> 00:30:35,655
EMBARRASSMENT, I HOPE YOU KNOW
THAT.

867
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,445
AND THE SWEDISH ENERGY AGENCY
WILL POINT OUT THAT THEY'VE NOW

868
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,898
BACKED AWAY FROM THAT UGANDAN

869
00:30:39,983 --> 00:30:41,711
PROJECT, BUT I'LL POINT OUT THEY

870
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:43,338
ONLY DID THAT AFTER THAT

871
00:30:43,423 --> 00:30:44,570
NEWS SEGMENT YOU JUST SAW

872
00:30:44,655 --> 00:30:46,632
EMBARRASSED THEM ON SWEDISH
TELEVISION.

873
00:30:46,717 --> 00:30:49,718
THEY WERE COMPLETELY FINE WITH
IT UNTIL THEN.

874
00:30:49,803 --> 00:30:51,405
SO, IT SEEMS, AT BEST, THE

875
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,408
BENEFITS OF CARBON OFFSETS ARE

876
00:30:53,493 --> 00:30:57,257
WILDLY OVERSTATED, WHILE THE
HARM THEY CAN DO IS VERY REAL.

877
00:30:57,342 --> 00:31:00,030
AND WHILE THERE ARE ONGOING
EFFORTS TO AT LEAST IMPROVE THE

878
00:31:00,115 --> 00:31:04,257
STANDARDS OF REGISTRIES, THE TRUTH
IS, OFFSETS AREN'T THE ANSWER HERE.

879
00:31:04,342 --> 00:31:06,382
FUNDAMENTALLY, WE CAN'T OFFSET

880
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:08,569
OUR WAY OUT CLIMATE CHANGE.

881
00:31:08,654 --> 00:31:10,192
EVEN THE CURRENT CEO OF

882
00:31:10,277 --> 00:31:12,070
UNITED AIRLINES KNOWS THIS.

883
00:31:12,155 --> 00:31:13,702
HE'S ONE OF THE FEW HEADS OF A

884
00:31:13,787 --> 00:31:15,140
FOSSIL-FUEL-DEPENDENT COMPANY

885
00:31:15,225 --> 00:31:18,820
WHO'S ACTUALLY WILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE HOW
INADEQUATE OFFSETS CAN BE.

886
00:31:18,905 --> 00:31:20,890
>> THE REAL CHALLENGE WE HAVE

887
00:31:20,975 --> 00:31:23,515
GLOBALLY IS THAT MANKIND

888
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,624
PRODUCES 4,000 TIMES AS MANY

889
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:26,942
EMISSIONS AS WE DID IN THE

890
00:31:27,027 --> 00:31:28,148
PRE-INDUSTRIAL ERA.

891
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:31,296
AND MOST OF THESE CARBON OFFSET
PROJECTS ARE ABOUT PLANTING TREES.

892
00:31:31,381 --> 00:31:33,507
THERE IS NOT ROOM ON THE PLANET

893
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:35,945
TO PLANT 4,000 TIMES AS MANY
TREES.

894
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,468
IT SIMPLY CAN'T BE THE ANSWER.

895
00:31:37,553 --> 00:31:39,210
AND THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS IS

896
00:31:39,295 --> 00:31:40,821
IT'S THE EASY SOLUTION.

897
00:31:40,906 --> 00:31:42,070
IT'S THE SOLUTION THAT IF YOU'RE

898
00:31:42,155 --> 00:31:43,835
SITTING IN THE C-SUITE, YOU CAN

899
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,679
WRITE A CHECK AND CHECK THE BOX

900
00:31:45,764 --> 00:31:46,999
AND HAVE A MARKETING MESSAGE

901
00:31:47,084 --> 00:31:48,546
THAT I'VE OFFSET ALL MY CARBON,

902
00:31:48,631 --> 00:31:50,280
BUT YOU REALLY HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING.

903
00:31:50,365 --> 00:31:51,523
>> John: HE'S RIGHT.

904
00:31:51,647 --> 00:31:54,695
THAT AIRLINE CEO IS RIGHT.

905
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:57,812
ALTHOUGH IT SPEAKS TO THE
SEDUCTIVE POWER OF OFFSETS THAT

906
00:31:57,897 --> 00:32:00,624
EVEN HIS COMPANY CAN'T GIVE THEM
UP.

907
00:32:00,709 --> 00:32:02,007
IF YOU GO TO THE UNITED AIRLINES

908
00:32:02,092 --> 00:32:04,998
WEBSITE RIGHT NOW, YOU'LL FIND A
PAGE WHERE YOU CAN OFFSET YOUR

909
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:06,781
FLIGHT, IN FRONT OF A PICTURE OF

910
00:32:06,866 --> 00:32:08,148
A ****ING FOREST.

911
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:09,718
SO AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

912
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,930
SITTING IN THE C-SUITE, CHECKING

913
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:15,741
A BOX IS THE GHOST OF MARK
ZUCKERBERG FUTURE.

914
00:32:16,071 --> 00:32:20,023
BUT IT'S TRUE THAT THERE
LITERALLY ISN'T ENOUGH SPACE FOR

915
00:32:20,108 --> 00:32:21,828
EVERY COMPANY TO PLANT TREES AND

916
00:32:21,913 --> 00:32:23,663
FULFILL THEIR OWN NET ZERO
PLEDGE.

917
00:32:23,748 --> 00:32:25,421
BY ONE ESTIMATE, THERE'S ONLY

918
00:32:25,506 --> 00:32:27,921
ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION
HECTARES OF LAND LEFT THAT CAN

919
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:31,046
BE DEDICATED TO NEW FORESTS FOR
CARBON CAPTURE.

920
00:32:31,131 --> 00:32:33,533
AND SHELL ALONE, HAS PROPOSED

921
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,653
PLANTING A TENTH OF THAT AMOUNT.

922
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:37,440
THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE HAVE AN

923
00:32:37,525 --> 00:32:38,759
OFFSET SYSTEM THAT PLACES

924
00:32:38,844 --> 00:32:40,315
PROFITS OVER SCIENCE, AND THE

925
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,593
RULES REGULATING IT ARE FAR TOO
LAX.

926
00:32:42,678 --> 00:32:44,147
AND THE REASON I KNOW THAT IS,

927
00:32:44,232 --> 00:32:46,535
REMEMBER WHEN, FIVE MINUTES AGO,

928
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,523
I SAID THAT I COULD SET UP A
CARBON REGISTRY?

929
00:32:48,608 --> 00:32:51,140
YOU ALREADY KNEW WHERE THIS WAS
HEADING, RIGHT?

930
00:32:51,225 --> 00:32:52,927
YOU KNEW, IF THEY HAD A LOOPHOLE

931
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,615
WHERE I COULD SET UP A REGISTRY,
ESTABLISH WHATEVER STANDARDS I

932
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,018
WANT, AND START LISTING
PROJECTS, THAT I WAS GOING

933
00:32:58,084 --> 00:33:00,116
STRAIGHT THROUGH THAT ****ING
LOOPHOLE, RIGHT?

934
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:01,695
YOU KNEW THAT WAS GOING TO
HAPPEN.

935
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,921
WELL I'M GLAD TO SAY YOU WERE
CORRECT.

936
00:33:05,006 --> 00:33:07,265
WE SET UP OLIVER'S OFFSETS
CARBON REGISTRY, AND I'M

937
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,968
THRILLED TO ANNOUNCE AN EXCITING
NEW PROJECT THAT MEETS OUR

938
00:33:10,053 --> 00:33:12,522
EXACTING STANDARDS.
PLEASE -- COME WITH ME.

939
00:33:14,413 --> 00:33:18,695
AS YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE, WE HAVE
TREES IN THE STUDIO NOW, TREES

940
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,898
YOU CAN HELP PROTECT, WHILE ALSO
OFFSETTING YOUR PERSONAL CARBON FOOTPRINT.

941
00:33:22,983 --> 00:33:26,038
NOW, ARE ANY OF THESE TREES
UNDER THREAT?

942
00:33:26,132 --> 00:33:27,945
I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO TELL YOU
THAT THEY ARE.

943
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:32,132
BECAUSE I'LL CUT EVERY SINGLE
ONE OF THESE ****ERS DOWN.

944
00:33:32,225 --> 00:33:34,968
I'LL DO IT!
MAYBE THERE ARE BIRDS LIVING IN

945
00:33:35,053 --> 00:33:37,866
HERE, OR WHALES!
WHO KNOWS?

946
00:33:37,968 --> 00:33:41,812
BUT DON'T WORRY -- YOU CAN SAVE
THEM, SIMPLY BY SENDING ME ONE DOLLAR!

947
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:43,616
WE'RE ISSUING TEN THOUSAND

948
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:45,814
CARBON CREDITS, EACH OF WHICH

949
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:49,929
WILL STOP ME CUTTING THIS TREE
DOWN FOR EXACTLY FIVE MINUTES.

950
00:33:50,014 --> 00:33:53,640
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO TO
OliversOffsets.org, PAY ME A

951
00:33:53,725 --> 00:33:57,007
DOLLAR, AND IN RETURN WE'LL SEND
YOU BACK A CARD THAT YOU CAN USE

952
00:33:57,092 --> 00:33:59,155
AS PROOF THAT YOU'RE NOW
"CARBON NEUTRAL."

953
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,921
WE'RE MAKING BIG CLAIMS WHILE

954
00:34:01,047 --> 00:34:03,523
DOING VERY LITTLE, WHICH
HONESTLY, IS ENTIRELY REFLECTIVE

955
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,328
OF THE SYSTEM WE CURRENTLY HAVE.

956
00:34:05,413 --> 00:34:08,570
SO WHY NOT OFFSET YOUR CARBON
TODAY?

957
00:34:08,655 --> 00:34:12,133
ALL PROCEEDS WILL GO TO SAVING
IRISH WHALES AND DOLPHINS.

958
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:14,812
AND WHO WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

959
00:34:14,897 --> 00:34:17,984
ANYWAY, THAT'S OUR SHOW,
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING!

960
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:19,359
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

961
00:34:19,555 --> 00:34:26,234
- [CHAINSAW WHIRRING]
- GOOD NIGHT!

962
00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:27,601
I'LL DO IT!

963
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:29,653
I'LL DO IT!

964
00:34:29,914 --> 00:34:31,382
GIVE ME MONEY!

965
00:34:31,467 --> 00:34:32,370
I'LL DO IT!

966
00:34:32,455 --> 00:34:33,490
GIVE ME A DOLLAR!

967
00:34:34,342 --> 00:34:36,585
I'LL CUT THIS ****ING THING

968
00:34:36,677 --> 00:34:37,640
I'LL DO IT!
