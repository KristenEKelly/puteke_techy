1
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,659
Welcome, to Last Week Tonight!

2
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,939
I'm John Oliver,
thank you so much for joining us.

3
00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:40,140
It has been a busy week.
The U.S. entered a bear market,

4
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,780
there was historic flooding
in Yellowstone National Park,

5
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,460
and in Peru, a hearing concerning
a corruption inquiry into their president

6
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,820
was disrupted in
a truly spectacular way.

7
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:57,540
What the public prosecutor's office
is investigating is clearly gentlemen,

8
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:01,659
there is interference from what
seems to be the law firm,

9
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,979
showing very suggestive images.

10
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:10,139
I will say, that's a little more
than suggestive images, though.

11
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,820
A suggestive image is the enticing
hint of what lies beneath.

12
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:16,059
That is straight up dick.

13
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,979
That is a whole dick on the TV in Peru.

14
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,419
But instead of focusing on all of that,
we're going to concentrate on the U.S.,

15
00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:27,180
where the House committee
investigating January 6th continued

16
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:30,460
to unearth new details regarding
the days leading up to the insurrection,

17
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,059
including the surprisingly large role of
Trump's legal adviser, John Eastman.

18
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,339
Quick side note, if you are ever
accused of a crime

19
00:01:38,419 --> 00:01:43,259
and your lawyer shows up to court
dressed like this, you are going to jail.

20
00:01:44,699 --> 00:01:47,419
Eastman was the one who devised
the theory that Mike Pence

21
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:51,259
could single-handedly negate the
election results a theory that was met

22
00:01:51,339 --> 00:01:53,419
with an appropriate level
of skepticism at the time

23
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:54,900
from this White House lawyer.

24
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,259
I said, hold on a second. I want to
understand what you're saying.

25
00:01:59,339 --> 00:02:02,979
You're saying that you believe
the vice president acting as president

26
00:02:03,059 --> 00:02:07,699
of the Senate can be the sole decision
maker as to, under your theory,

27
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:09,700
who becomes the next president
of the United States?

28
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:17,140
And he said: Yes. I said:
Are you out of your effing mind?

29
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:20,900
Right, although I will say,
at this point, you can just say fuck.

30
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:24,819
Democracy is hanging on by a thread,
and you had a front row seat.

31
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,980
You can say fuck. You said it
then and you should say it now.

32
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:30,860
Because what he was suggesting
to you there was bonkers.

33
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:34,339
The idea that a single person could
decide the presidency

34
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,700
is completely against
the ideals of this country,

35
00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:42,140
which is why the Constitution starts
with the people and not Mike.

36
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,939
Also and I know it's not
the important thing here,

37
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,939
but what is happening
behind that man?

38
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,140
Why does this bat have justice
written on it?

39
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:55,580
And what are these three metal wig
things right below it?

40
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:56,740
Do you wear them?

41
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:59,059
Or did you see one
of those guys painted silver

42
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,339
who moves when you give him money,
and scalp him?

43
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,140
Also, that panda painting was apparently
and this is true featured

44
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:09,779
in the Fifty Shades of GrayYmovie.
It is all very weird!

45
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:12,539
I would say it's the most distracting
visuals during

46
00:03:12,619 --> 00:03:14,900
a televised government hearing,
but as we all know,

47
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,099
Peru has significantly
raised the bar in that regard.

48
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,980
Obviously, the point of these hearings
is to learn lessons from the efforts

49
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:26,140
to steal the last election,
to prevent it from happening again.

50
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:28,860
But for many Republicans,
it seems the only mistake they see

51
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:31,980
is that they didn't go far enough.
Because we are in the midst

52
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:36,539
of a midterm election year right now,
and already, more than 100 Republican

53
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:40,140
primary winners back Trump's false
claims of election fraud.

54
00:03:40,619 --> 00:03:44,659
An especially concerning subset
are candidates for secretary of state,

55
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,659
because they could end up
in a position to directly influence

56
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,619
the next presidential election.

57
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:54,140
Take Jim Marchant who looks like
what a child would produce if you simply

58
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:55,980
told them to draw business.

59
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,860
On Tuesday, Marchant became the
Republican nominee

60
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,619
for secretary of state in Nevada.

61
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,300
Which is alarming, given that he's
a conspiracy theorist

62
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,659
who's said things like this.

63
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:10,779
The shape that our country is in right
now is because of election fraud.

64
00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:14,980
The people of Nevada have
not elected anybody since 2006,

65
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:18,299
they've been installed by
the deep state cabal.

66
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:24,419
The people of Nevada haven't
legitimately elected anybody since 2006.

67
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:27,900
That is a pretty bold claim,
especially coming from a guy

68
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:31,820
who himself was elected to the state
assembly there in 2016.

69
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,900
Also, when Marchant was asked
to specify who, exactly,

70
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:39,179
he thought was stealing elections,
he said, I don't know actually.

71
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:41,219
I think it's a global thing.

72
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:44,020
The people in power want
to maintain their power.

73
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:47,539
Which is honestly pretty refreshing
coming from a conspiracy theorist.

74
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,900
We all know there's a secret
cabal pulling the strings of politicians

75
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:54,659
around the world, but I'm certainly
not going to wildly speculate about it.

76
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:56,500
That would be irresponsible.

77
00:04:57,219 --> 00:05:00,219
But crucially, Marchant isn't alone
he's actually leading

78
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:01,539
a group of candidates

79
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,620
called the America First Secretary
of State Coalition,

80
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,020
which also includes New Mexico's
Audrey Trujillo, who's referred

81
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,219
to the 2020 election as coup,
which makes her explanation of

82
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:14,700
why she decided to run
for office a bit worrisome.

83
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:20,339
I decided to run for secretary of
state when I saw the in the very

84
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:22,940
inconsistencies
in this last election.

85
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:26,859
I feel that a lot of people,
whether we can prove it or not,

86
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,419
feel that this election was stolen.

87
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,739
Whether we can prove it or not?

88
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,979
But that's a pretty big loophole,
isn't it, Audrey?

89
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:39,380
We all believe plenty of things
that we can't prove,

90
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,260
but we shouldn't base major life
decisions on them.

91
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:45,979
For instance, I can't prove that,
in his day, beloved children's author

92
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,380
of The Giving Tree Shel
Silverstein was fucking nonstop.

93
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,859
I believe it, though. I mean,
look at him. Now you believe it, too.

94
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:56,179
Look at America's first fuckboy.

95
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,739
He knows exactly
where the sidewalk ends.

96
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,299
But again, we can't prove that,
can we?

97
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,140
So, we just keep that belief in
our hearts and try not to use it

98
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:07,979
as motivation to completely
dismantle dis democracy.

99
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,539
It's the least that we can do.

100
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,020
And then there is Kristina Karamo,
who is running for secretary

101
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:15,620
of state in Michigan,
and who is really something.

102
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:20,179
Kristina Karamo has not been shy in
insisting there was widespread cheating

103
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,539
in the 2020 vote,
touting debunked claims,

104
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,539
and saying Donald Trump
was the true winner in Michigan.

105
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,700
Her most inflammatory language
is aimed at Democrats.

106
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:31,580
Their party has totally been taken
over by a satanic agenda.

107
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:34,020
Including Michigan's
current secretary of state.

108
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:37,859
She's an evil woman.
She's a very evil woman.

109
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:42,299
Democrats don't have
a satanic agenda, mainly because

110
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,140
that would require having
an agenda in the first place.

111
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,700
For the record, Michigan's current
secretary of state,

112
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:51,859
Jocelyn Benson, is not evilÂ…

113
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:55,099
In fact, just go to her Wikipedia page,
and look for the section entitled

114
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:57,739
Horrible Acts of Evil.
It is just not there.

115
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:03,339
Although you will find that she has
completed 23 full marathons since 2005.

116
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,700
But that's not evil, is it?
It's just annoying.

117
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,620
No judgment, but the only reason

118
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,859
to run that many marathons is because
you like bragging to your friends,

119
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,339
or you're horny for stopping traffic.
Those are the only two options.

120
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:19,979
Extreme views on election fraud
are par for the course for this coalition.

121
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,779
The thing with Karamo is that
she has a lot of other views, too.

122
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,739
She suggested in a podcast that
premarital sex paves the way

123
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,739
for society condoning pedophilia.

124
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:33,979
When we normalize people fornicating
and we normalize people living together

125
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,539
with their boyfriends
and girlfriends, all this stuff,

126
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,179
we open a door to us to get to
the point where we have people

127
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,940
who want to normalize pedophilia.

128
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,500
She also referred to herself
as an anti-vaxxer

129
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,060
before the Covid-19
vaccines were authorized.

130
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,020
Guess what.
I'm crazy. I'm an anti-vaxxer.

131
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:54,219
Come on.
You don't sound crazy.

132
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,140
Whispered Voice on the Phone.

133
00:07:57,219 --> 00:07:59,099
And while there is a lot to
object to there

134
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,620
we normalize people fornicating
and living together

135
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,419
as boyfriend and girlfriend,
is like, 10 fake moral panics ago.

136
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:09,020
I'm not saying that she's not wrong,
it's just she's wrong in such

137
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:11,419
an outdated way.
It's like finding out someone

138
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,739
is mad at Bill Clinton for trying weed.

139
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:18,380
You're upset about that? Today?
I mean, you're wrong for being mad

140
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,500
about that, but even worse,
you're late.

141
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:24,060
And look, these are just three
of the worrying candidates

142
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,260
for secretary of state around
the country there are many others.

143
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:29,500
Which should frankly
give everyone pause.

144
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,659
Because the January 6th committee
is reminding everyone

145
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,059
just how close we came
to democracy basically collapsing.

146
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:39,140
It was a handful of people
in the right position choosing

147
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:43,020
to do the right thing that saved us
from a constitutional crisis.

148
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,980
But there are multiple candidates running
for consequential positions right now

149
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:51,140
on the platform of basically. Let's do
the coup again but better next time.

150
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,939
And if you are not
worried about that,

151
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,419
if I may quote a man with the world's
most chaotic Zoom backdrop,

152
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,459
you're out of your fucking
mind. And now, this.

153
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:07,020
And Now: In Honor of Father's Day,
Zaddies.

154
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:11,299
- You didn't know what a zaddy is.
- I don't.

155
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,819
- What is a zaddy?
- A zaddy is a very hot, sexy older man.

156
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,340
- What's the Z stand for?
- It's like Daddy, but with a Z.

157
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:23,020
Defined as an attractive man
who is also stylish, charming,

158
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,579
and self- confident.

159
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:27,020
- Are you a zaddy?
- I don't think so.

160
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:29,939
Happy Zaddy's Day over
there to you two.

161
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,699
- Are you saying. We're zaddies?
- We qualify as zaddies?

162
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:35,020
Let's talk about Jeff
Bezos to wrap this up.

163
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,900
He has accomplished a lot in his life,
and now he's adding another

164
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,539
title to his extensive list of
achievements a zaddy.

165
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,260
The zaddy himself, Dr. Anthony
Fauci.

166
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,900
- Is Putin a zaddy?
- 100% not.

167
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,900
- Who's more zaddy?
- You're both equally zaddy.

168
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,539
- I'm not a zaddy.
- No. Sorry, Derek. Yeah.

169
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,419
I would say my husband's a
zaddy.

170
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,419
You watching, boo?
Are you watching?

171
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:05,419
That's what you said about Gary down
the hallway, too, but whatever.

172
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:11,380
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns housing.

173
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,220
The thing that 16-year-old TikTok

174
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:15,220
millionaires can afford,
and you can't.

175
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,939
Housing is something TV audiences
can't seem to get enough of,

176
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,059
whether it's watching angry
couples hunt for the perfect place

177
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,299
to get divorced in, or
watching celebrities

178
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,659
giving Architectural Digest tours of
their homes, as they discover things

179
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,740
that were clearly put
there by stylists,

180
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:33,419
and occasionally call it out in a
gloriously passive-aggressive way.

181
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:38,020
I love cooking. I cook a lot
and I bake a lot. I love limes,

182
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,179
I love them, they're great,
I love them so much

183
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,380
and I like to present them
like this in my house.

184
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,220
She is so magnificently weird.

185
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:49,539
Now, real Dakota-heads will know that
she later claimed she is,

186
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,459
in fact, actually allergic to limes,

187
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:54,699
saying, It was hard to ignore
them, so I just lied.

188
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,380
But she may well have just been
lying about that as well.

189
00:10:57,459 --> 00:10:59,939
She's pure chaos, I love her,
she should be the president.

190
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,539
But this story
isn't going to be about people

191
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,699
who own their
own lime-infested homes.

192
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,699
It's going to be about the more than a
third of American households who rent.

193
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:11,059
And if you do rent, you'll
undoubtedly be aware

194
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,900
of what's been happening recently.

195
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:16,699
Tonight, skyrocketing rents,
forcing a growing number of Americans

196
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:19,419
to think twice about where home is.

197
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,500
Rent prices across the country
skyrocketing.

198
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:26,860
- Rents are rising nationwide.
- Rents are going way, way up.

199
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:31,059
Yeah, rent is skyrocketing.
And that is the last thing that you want

200
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,659
to hear is on the rise, along
with Covid cases, murder rates,

201
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,860
and Henry Kissinger's life
expectancy.

202
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,260
The bitch just won't quit, will he?

203
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:44,740
The median monthly asking rent in the
U.S. surpassed $2,000

204
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:46,740
for the first time last month

205
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:49,260
that is up 15% since the same time
last year,

206
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,779
well above the rate of inflation.

207
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,260
And it's up over 30% in cities like
Cincinnati, Seattle,

208
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,659
and Nashville and
nearly 50% in Austin.

209
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,779
You, or someone you know, may well
be struggling to find a place right now,

210
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,340
or are being priced out of where you
currently live by your landlord.

211
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:11,059
But the fact is, rent affordability
isn't a remotely new problem.

212
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,299
If you live in New York, your city became
unaffordable to rent in in 2004.

213
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:19,819
See this line? That line is
30% of what you make.

214
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,340
Generally, for rent, it's advised you
don't spend past that line.

215
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,340
But if you live in Miami, you
probably passed that line in 2001.

216
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,500
And in Chicago in 2012.

217
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,779
Los Angeles has been plain unaffordable
since before 1979.

218
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:38,059
Rent is growing faster than the money
most people make to pay it.

219
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,500
It's true. Rent is growing
faster than wages.

220
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:45,380
It's a problem we've known about for
decades and is only getting worse.

221
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:48,620
Which was, I believe,
a working title for this show.

222
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,179
It was either that,
or America's Saddest Home

223
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,020
Videos with Adult McLovin.

224
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:59,900
In fact you're laughing too hard at that.
In fact, right now there is not

225
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,500
a single county in the U.S. where
a worker earning minimum wage

226
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:06,260
can afford a modest two-bedroom
rental home.

227
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:09,699
And look, there are undoubtedly
individual landlords out there

228
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,020
who behave decently to their
tenants.

229
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,819
But many others will conveniently

230
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,939
blame the market rate
for extortionate rent hikes,

231
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,900
and imply that the
decision simply isn't theirs to make.

232
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,260
Just watch financial guru Dave Ramsey
try and reassure one landlord

233
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,100
who said he felt guilty about raising
his rents above

234
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:27,740
what his tenants could afford.

235
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:35,340
If I raise my rent to be market rate,
that does not make me a bad Christian.

236
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:40,179
I did not displace the
person out of the house

237
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,699
if they can no longer afford it,
the marketplace did.

238
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,220
The economy did. The ratio of the
income that they earned

239
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:50,340
to their housing expense
displaced them.

240
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:53,220
I didn't cause any of that.

241
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,699
Kicking someone out of your
house doesn't make you a bad Christian.

242
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,260
It's in the Beatitudes,

243
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,419
Blessed are the poor in spirit,
for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.

244
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,579
Fucked are the poor in money, for
theirs is the Kingdom of Landlords.

245
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:07,100
Wazzaaaa!

246
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:10,659
So, given that rents are going up,

247
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,659
and some landlords seem to think
that that's completely unavoidable,

248
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,980
we thought tonight,
we'd look at rental housing

249
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:18,860
why it's increasingly
expensive, how steeply the system

250
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:22,299
is stacked against renters,
and what we can do to combat that.

251
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,299
And let's start with understanding
our current housing supply.

252
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,539
You'll often hear that high rents
are a supply

253
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,380
and demand issue basically,
too many renters, not enough units.

254
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:33,059
And that is partially true.

255
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,020
Because there are currently not nearly
enough affordable units in the U.S.

256
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,340
Which is a little weird
to think about, isn't it?

257
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:40,900
Because if you live in any city,

258
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,740
you probably see new
buildings cropping up all the time,

259
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:48,699
called things like 4 East
or Summit 3 Eleven, with taglines like,

260
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:50,980
Luxury urban dwellings driven by
design.

261
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:53,179
There's almost certainly a
coffee shop without

262
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,819
a bathroom on the ground floor.

263
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,900
So, apartments are being
built. But the problem is,

264
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,500
thanks in part to local NIMBY
opposition to more affordable,

265
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:03,020
multi-family housing,

266
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,900
it's mainly been at the high end.
In fact, in the last three decades,

267
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,900
the national stock of rental
units available actually grew

268
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,659
by more than 13 million.
But, crucially, the number of units

269
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,380
at the lowest end of the market fell
by nearly 4 million.

270
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:21,100
That might be why if you've ever
tried to search for affordable apartments

271
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:23,819
in your area,
Google just says, nope.

272
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,059
And this serious lack of new affordable
housing has enabled landlords

273
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,900
to charge higher rents for
the units that exist.

274
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,539
Something that has increasingly
attracted institutional investors

275
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,380
these are corporate
landlords, like private equity firms,

276
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:40,020
or even publicly traded
companies, that pool the rents

277
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,699
of their tenants and sell them
as investments.

278
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,459
They have long been players in
apartment rentals, but more recently,

279
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:49,980
after the 2008 housing crash,
companies like these popped up,

280
00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:53,020
to snap up single-family homes,
and rent them out.

281
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,140
And because institutional
investors are always trying

282
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,579
to maximize returns, they'll take
any opportunity to push rents higher.

283
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:02,179
Take Monarch,

284
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,459
which has been called middle
America's fastest-growing landlord.

285
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:09,699
Here is their owner, last year,
salivating at the prospect of rent hikes.

286
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,539
We have an unprecedented opportunity,
at least in my working lifetime,

287
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,699
to really press rents, press
rents on renewals

288
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:22,939
because the country is highly occupied
we're 97 and a half percent.

289
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,939
And so,
where are people going to go?

290
00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:27,620
They can't go anywhere.
They want to be in apartments,

291
00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:30,779
or they have to be in apartments,
and we have a tremendous opportunity

292
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:36,059
to press both on renewing leases
for existing residents,

293
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,340
and to reset market rates, which
we've reset numerous times

294
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:41,659
even this year.

295
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:46,620
They can't go anywhere, and for us,
that's an unprecedented opportunity

296
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:48,020
to press them.

297
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,779
That is a terrible way
to talk about people.

298
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,620
Honestly, it's barely an
acceptable way to talk about paninis.

299
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:57,419
Those sandwiches
can't go anywhere, fuck it, press 'em.

300
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,220
Squeeze those fuckers.
I wanna see lines!

301
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:04,900
So, if you are wondering why your rent
is going up, it may well be

302
00:17:04,979 --> 00:17:07,900
because your landlord sees the
current affordable housing crisis

303
00:17:07,979 --> 00:17:10,499
as a chance to reset
market rates.

304
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,860
And in a lot of the country,
there are very few legal constraints

305
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:15,620
to stop them doing that.

306
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:18,780
You may have heard of rent control,
which strictly limits how much

307
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,540
a landlord can charge you,
but vanishingly few people have

308
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,100
access to that anymore.

309
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:25,739
More commonly, there's rent
stabilization.

310
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,380
Which, in theory, means
that on certain older properties,

311
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:32,219
landlords can only raise the rent
by a certain percentage per year.

312
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,780
But only two states and D.C.
require it,

313
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,739
and more than 30 states
have actually passed laws banning it.

314
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,979
And even when protections exist,
landlords can find ways around them.

315
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,259
For instance, they might
try and force rent-stabilized tenants out

316
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,060
by allowing a property to fall into
disrepair, or by harassing them

317
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,580
with incessant construction
until they voluntarily leave.

318
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:57,219
Take the rent-stabilized tenants
who lived in this building in New York.

319
00:17:57,699 --> 00:18:00,100
Their landlord
claimed that he was simply upgrading it

320
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,060
to improve tenants'
quality of life.

321
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:04,459
But that is not how it felt to them.

322
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:07,860
Tenants say they were offered buyouts
to leave, but some,

323
00:18:07,939 --> 00:18:10,820
like George Manatos and Gretchen
Mongrain, who've lived here

324
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,939
for almost 10 years, opted to stay.

325
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,459
A decision they say came
with a warning.

326
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:20,419
If you don't take the buyout,
we are going to renovate this,

327
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:23,820
and you are going to have to live
through the nightmare of renovation.

328
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,499
Mongrain says the unit next to her was
demolished with a crowbar.

329
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,259
When she asked about the noise
and debris left behind.

330
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,620
All the person said was, I just want
to let you know there's going

331
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:37,140
to be a lot of rats from now on.

332
00:18:37,939 --> 00:18:41,419
It says a lot that they would
endure a rat-littered construction site

333
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:44,459
just to hold onto a
rent-stabilized unit.

334
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,019
Because that is not exactly
a welcoming message.

335
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,419
If you went to someone's
home and their welcome mat said,

336
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:51,780
"There's going to be a lot of
rats from now on,

337
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,540
you would drop your casserole dish then
and there and turn the fuck around.

338
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:01,100
Thereby instantly falling right into the
rats' trap. And it is worth noting,

339
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:04,179
when rent-stabilized
tenants did leave that building,

340
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:08,219
the asking rents, unsurprisingly,
then as much as doubled.

341
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,979
And I assume that those apartments
were then snapped up

342
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,179
by a nice young rat
couple with rich tastes

343
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:15,540
and disposable income.
I believe we have a photo?

344
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:18,780
Yeah, there it is. Yeah.
They seem nice.

345
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,780
And with rents being squeezed across
the board, and protections few

346
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,739
and far between, lower-income
renters are, obviously,

347
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,380
the most vulnerable here.

348
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,459
Even before the pandemic struck,

349
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,019
23 million people lived
in households

350
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,860
that paid more than half their
income on rent and utilities.

351
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:38,780
Which is just not
sustainable for anyone.

352
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,219
Now, in theory,
we have something designed

353
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,140
to combat that federal housing

354
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:45,459
assistance in the form of housing
choice vouchers,

355
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,140
commonly known
as Section 8.

356
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:50,620
The idea behind them is that a
household still has to pay 30%

357
00:19:50,699 --> 00:19:52,979
of its monthly
income for rent and utilities,

358
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,499
but the government will then
help cover the rest.

359
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,540
The problem is, this program is
massively underfunded,

360
00:19:59,939 --> 00:20:02,540
to the point that only one in four
households that qualify

361
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,419
for assistance actually receive it. As
we've shown on this show before,

362
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:09,540
sometimes, people have literally raced
to apply for vouchers

363
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,499
when they became available.

364
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,380
And even once you have applied,
the waiting period can be absurd.

365
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:19,620
Take Chicago Alderwoman Jeanette
Taylor, whose application took

366
00:20:19,699 --> 00:20:21,860
a ridiculously long time to
be approved.

367
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,820
- When did you apply for this voucher?
- In 1993.

368
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:31,300
- And when did you get it?
- 2022.

369
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,780
So, 29 years.

370
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,900
What was your reaction
when you got that letter?

371
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:39,620
I just sat on the side of the bed
for like an hour in shock.

372
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:42,900
And I was like, God, you got a
sick sense of humor.

373
00:20:42,979 --> 00:20:45,780
I mean, she's right. He does.

374
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,780
Although to be honest, I kind of prefer
God's earlier stuff.

375
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,780
Convincing Abraham to almost kill his
son as a prank?

376
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,419
Very funny. Flooding the world and
making one guy get every animal

377
00:20:55,499 --> 00:20:57,140
species to fuck on a boat?

378
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,300
Hilarious! But a housing voucher
that's 29 years late?

379
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,739
That does start to feel like God
might be running out of ideas.

380
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,219
And the thing is, even if you are lucky
enough to get a voucher,

381
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,300
you still then have to find
a landlord willing to accept it.

382
00:21:11,699 --> 00:21:14,060
But many landlords don't,
either because they see it

383
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,860
as a bureaucratic hassle,
or because they have a stigma

384
00:21:16,939 --> 00:21:21,140
against Section 8 recipients, which
leads to a lot of stories like these.

385
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,540
I was blessed with a homing choice
voucher in April,

386
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:30,939
and I haven't been able to find a spot.

387
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:34,739
I called over 200 places that would
supposedly take the voucher,

388
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,100
and none of those places were
actually renting.

389
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:40,620
How many places do you think you got
turned down from?

390
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,499
Jesus, at least 15.

391
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,820
15 places turned you down?

392
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,780
If not more. It's like I have a plague.
It's like we have a plague.

393
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,459
Everywhere you turn, no Section 8.
I've called up 50 apartment complexes

394
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:58,340
in Sacramento. They don't look
at me as an individual.

395
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,900
I'm on Section 8, therefore
I'm poor. Therefore, I'm bad.

396
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:07,820
That is terrible. Because even the worst
people will honor vouchers.

397
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,780
Take Willy Wonka. Sure, he
may have run a sweatshop

398
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,939
with horrible safety protocols
that put children's lives in danger,

399
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:17,939
but even he had the decency
to honor the fucking vouchers.

400
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,259
Now, discrimination
against those with Section 8 vouchers

401
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,179
is illegal in some
places.

402
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:27,979
But even where that is the case,
landlords can just invent other reasons

403
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,739
to turn people away.
And with housing this tight,

404
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,979
rents skyrocketing, and
landlords holding this much power,

405
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,340
low-income renters can be left
vulnerable

406
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,620
to the nightmare scenario:
eviction.

407
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,300
We've talked about evictions
on this show before.

408
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,659
They're invasive, traumatizing,
and like all the other perils of renting,

409
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:47,140
disproportionately
affect Black people.

410
00:22:47,219 --> 00:22:50,179
One study of more than 1,000 counties
found Black renters made up

411
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:52,580
around 20% of all adult renters,

412
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:55,780
but nearly a third of all eviction
filing defendants.

413
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,499
And perhaps nowhere demonstrates
the enormous power imbalance

414
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,659
between landlords and tenants more
than housing court.

415
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,419
Starting with the fact that,
in most places,

416
00:23:05,499 --> 00:23:09,179
tenants don't have a right
to a lawyer in eviction proceedings.

417
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,939
And if you don't have an attorney
to guide you through

418
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:14,820
what can be a complex process,
not only can you fail

419
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,699
to raise legitimate defenses,
you can make basic mistakes

420
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,739
with huge consequences.

421
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,100
Gina comes across a tenant sitting
distraught.

422
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:25,620
So, she came to court dutifully,
came to court early,

423
00:23:25,699 --> 00:23:28,380
and as happens sometimes because
court is confusing,

424
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,459
she sat in the wrong courtroom.

425
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,739
While her case was heard
in a different courtroom.

426
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,340
When she realized her mistake,
she dashed over

427
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:39,380
and caught the landlord outside,
but he doesn't want to speak with her.

428
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,739
And the court informed her
that after 10 days,

429
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,659
the sheriff would come in
and remove her and her three children

430
00:23:45,739 --> 00:23:47,340
from her home.

431
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,060
One tiny mistake and
her housing was gone.

432
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,939
Which is clearly unfair.

433
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:56,459
The only time someone should be
punished for going into the wrong room

434
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,699
is when they accidentally
stumble into the 3:30

435
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:03,140
showing of Downton A New Era.
Cause get ready for a long, boring ride.

436
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,860
"Oh, but John, it's delightful
because they're British!" It is not.

437
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,380
One study of nearly 100,000 eviction
cases in Denver

438
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:16,259
found that nearly 90% of landlords were
represented by a lawyer,

439
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,900
compared to less than 1% of
tenants.

440
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:21,179
Which is not good.

441
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,219
And yet, some attorneys who
work for landlords get very angry

442
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,100
at the suggestion that
tenants are poorly protected.

443
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:30,540
Take this guy, who represents
multiple landlords in St. Louis.

444
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,499
He is self-styled guru for
the real estate bar.

445
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,340
And just listen to him giving a Zoom
seminar about evictions

446
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:40,459
and rolling his eyes at some of the
basic legal protections extended

447
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,019
to renters during Covid.

448
00:24:42,979 --> 00:24:45,179
The advocates for the tenants are like,

449
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:50,100
these people still don't know
what's available to them

450
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:53,179
and they don't know anything
about the CDC declaration.

451
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:58,380
Them! Them all! They're
too stupid to know

452
00:24:58,459 --> 00:25:00,140
what their legal rights are?

453
00:25:00,219 --> 00:25:05,259
They shouldn't have signed
a contract for $1,000 a month unit

454
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:11,380
for a year if they're too stupid to
sign, to know anything,

455
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,979
to read the news, to have
any idea about their rights.

456
00:25:15,699 --> 00:25:19,979
If they're too stupid, they shouldn't
be signing the $12,000 contract.

457
00:25:20,699 --> 00:25:23,179
Okay, first, that is definitely

458
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:26,340
the angriest I've ever seen anyone
wearing a Rush hat.

459
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,140
And second, there is just no doubt
in my mind that that man,

460
00:25:30,219 --> 00:25:33,140
at some point in his life, has been
kicked out of a youth soccer game.

461
00:25:33,219 --> 00:25:37,780
He just exudes "Ref, I'd like a word!"
energy. I guarantee,

462
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,820
that is a man who has thrown
a lawn chair,

463
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,540
or at the very least squeezed
a Kool-Aid Jammer so tight

464
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,659
in his fists the other parents thought
his hand was coveredin blood.

465
00:25:45,739 --> 00:25:48,699
Besides that, I will say,
he seems like a cool guy.

466
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:52,019
That is what tenants
can be up against.

467
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:56,580
And the problem is, eviction
filings can be on your record for years,

468
00:25:56,659 --> 00:25:58,900
jeopardizing your chance at future
housing.

469
00:25:59,219 --> 00:26:01,259
Just watch as this woman contacts
a realtor

470
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,979
about a home that she is
interested in.

471
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:05,900
Did you get a chance
to drive by and take a look at it?

472
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:08,580
Yeah. I'm sitting in front of the
home right now as we speak.

473
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:11,100
Okay. And what's your name?

474
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,179
- Margaret.
- Okay, Margaret.

475
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:16,939
And how soon are you looking to move
into a house?

476
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:20,620
As soon as possible. Right now.

477
00:26:21,499 --> 00:26:23,780
Are you on a lease where
you're living at right now?

478
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:28,219
No, as a matter of fact, we're not.
We're actually homeless.

479
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:32,939
Okay, and so where are
you currently living?

480
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,580
In our vehicle.

481
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,300
Unfortunately, when we check the
court records and see an eviction,

482
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,219
unfortunately,
we can't help you.

483
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,019
There are some things that should
probably stay on your record.

484
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,380
Like war crimes,
or voting for Taylor Hicks

485
00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:51,939
in the 2006 season
of American Idol.

486
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:54,380
You shouldn't get to come back
from that so easily.

487
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:58,019
But people should have a chance
to find safe and affordable housing,

488
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,499
since the alternative
is being homeless!

489
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:03,140
And the thing is,
you can be turned down

490
00:27:03,219 --> 00:27:06,659
for housing simply because an eviction
case was filed against you,

491
00:27:06,739 --> 00:27:10,219
even if that case was later dropped,
or, indeed, you won it.

492
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,860
The long-term
damage that eviction filings

493
00:27:12,939 --> 00:27:15,820
do to your records is why many
will choose not to fight

494
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,019
when a landlord tries
to kick them out.

495
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,019
That is one of the reasons that
people can wind up

496
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,900
with a so-called "informal" eviction.

497
00:27:21,979 --> 00:27:24,540
That's where their landlord
does things like change the locks,

498
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,780
threaten them, or even
remove the front door.

499
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,140
It is hard to measure just how many of
these take place each year,

500
00:27:30,219 --> 00:27:33,739
but a survey of Milwaukee renters
found that for every eviction executed

501
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,340
through the judicial system,

502
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:37,820
there are two others executed
outside the court,

503
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,140
without any form of due process.

504
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,580
And given just how
devastating evictions can be,

505
00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:47,459
it is infuriating to hear how
some involved in the process view it.

506
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,939
Remember that screaming
Rush fan from earlier?

507
00:27:50,459 --> 00:27:53,019
Well, it turns out, he
actually has a little more to say.

508
00:27:53,699 --> 00:27:56,900
It's sad to say, and some of you who
are not landlords might be shocked

509
00:27:56,979 --> 00:28:01,380
to hear, we evict grandparents
who are poor.

510
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:05,939
We evict cancer-stricken
people who are attending chemo.

511
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:12,499
It's sad, but what's sadder
is that somebody who purchases

512
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:19,820
property for hundreds of thousands
of dollars is given the finger by the law.

513
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:24,140
Except it's not sadder.
It's just not.

514
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:28,939
On the great big list of sad things,
person getting evicted during chemo

515
00:28:29,019 --> 00:28:32,100
is right up there with dog
deathsY and the first 10 minutes

516
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:35,739
of Up.' While "landlord
doesn't get rent"

517
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,140
is at the very bottom

518
00:28:37,219 --> 00:28:39,900
with "celebrity Tweets about
a shitty airline experience,"

519
00:28:39,979 --> 00:28:42,499
and "white guy not allowed
to rap all the lyrics."

520
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:48,419
It's objectively not that sad at all.
That is the core issue

521
00:28:48,499 --> 00:28:50,580
with rental housing
in this country, though,

522
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:53,219
people who think that investments
deserve more respect

523
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,380
than basic human needs.
And it has set up a system designed

524
00:28:56,459 --> 00:28:59,780
to ensure that some people
just spiral downwards.

525
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,939
They can't move somewhere cheaper
if nowhere cheaper exists.

526
00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:06,179
They can't apply for federal assistance
if there's nowhere near enough.

527
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:08,900
They can't even use that assistance
if no one accepts it.

528
00:29:08,979 --> 00:29:11,499
And they can't take their
landlord to court if the court system

529
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,380
is skewed against them.
And they can't depend

530
00:29:13,459 --> 00:29:16,380
on rental housing ever again
if they're evicted even just once.

531
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:20,060
It's a complete shit show.
What can we do about it?

532
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,419
There are some small
things that we could pass.

533
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:26,499
We could pass rent-stabilization laws
and laws that prohibit discrimination

534
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,820
against recipients of housing
choice vouchers,

535
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,939
and make it easier for landlords
to accept them.

536
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,259
We could also pass laws mandating
the sealing of most eviction records,

537
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,820
and give people a right
to counsel in housing court.

538
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,699
That alone can have massive impacts.
In 2017, after sustained pressure,

539
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,300
New York City became the
first place in the country

540
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,780
to give tenants the right to a
lawyer in housing court.

541
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,060
It is a major reason why, even
before the pandemic moratoriums,

542
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:54,419
residential evictions were down 40%.

543
00:29:54,939 --> 00:29:57,620
And luckily, other places are now
following that lead.

544
00:29:57,699 --> 00:29:58,979
But I would argue

545
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:02,620
what we really need to do is
fundamentally change our mindset away

546
00:30:02,699 --> 00:30:07,019
from simply hoping that we can tinker
around the edges of housing policy,

547
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,699
and the private market will sort
the rest of this shit out.

548
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,979
Because we've tried that for
decades and yet, here we are.

549
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,499
Instead, we need to agree:

550
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,739
housing is a human right.
And that is not actually

551
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,780
just some empty slogan like
Subway's "Eat Fresh," or Gatorade's

552
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,739
"Is it in you?" which,
looking back, was very, very weird.

553
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,620
This could actually be
policy. Many countries,

554
00:30:30,699 --> 00:30:33,900
including France, Scotland,
and South Africa have legally codified

555
00:30:33,979 --> 00:30:35,620
a right to housing.

556
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:38,499
And here in the U.S., three-quarters
of Americans already

557
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,739
believe that it is a human right.

558
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,780
As for what that would mean,
it would entail a massive federal

559
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,300
investment in rental assistance,
and the creation of much more

560
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,860
affordable housing units across
the board.

561
00:30:50,939 --> 00:30:53,659
And before anyone suggests
that we can't afford that,

562
00:30:53,739 --> 00:30:56,659
we already subsidize certain
people's homes.

563
00:30:57,219 --> 00:31:00,459
The mortgage interest deduction gives
massive subsidies to homeowners,

564
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,659
by letting them deduct the
interest that they pay

565
00:31:02,739 --> 00:31:04,380
on their mortgage on their taxes.

566
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:07,900
That has cost the federal government
more than $580 billion

567
00:31:07,979 --> 00:31:09,780
over the last decade.

568
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,820
And currently, nearly two-thirds
of the deduction's benefits

569
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,820
are going to those making
200,000 or more a year.

570
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:19,979
I am benefiting from this program,
and I do not need to be.

571
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,419
We are clearly willing to prioritize
housing in the budget,

572
00:31:23,499 --> 00:31:25,900
just not for the people
who need it the most.

573
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:29,340
The point here is,
for a large portion of the population,

574
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:32,939
simply having a place to live
is an everyday battle.

575
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:36,019
And for far too long,
we have prioritized the protection

576
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,499
of investments over individuals,
and we've set up a system

577
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,860
where landlords can press rents
and reset market rates,

578
00:31:42,939 --> 00:31:46,219
and justify their actions
with self-serving Bible readings,

579
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,900
even as they subject tenants
to everything from tactical rat assaults

580
00:31:49,979 --> 00:31:54,259
to the incoherent rage of the single
most foul-mouthed fan Ontario's

581
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:58,100
premiere prog rock power
trio has ever fucking known.

582
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,900
And now, this.

583
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:05,580
And Now:
It's Always Happy Hour on QVC.

584
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,499
I just think you looked so great in it,

585
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,939
Amy, and it's like, casual, but there's
like an updated elegance to it.

586
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,140
And of course,
I had to stop by with wine,

587
00:32:14,219 --> 00:32:15,780
cause I missed you guys last week.

588
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,860
- We love you.
- We love you, Jane Treacy.

589
00:32:17,939 --> 00:32:21,380
Thanks for swinging by, and I'll swing by
and bring you some more wine later on.

590
00:32:21,459 --> 00:32:23,860
It's just me, a few bottles of wine.

591
00:32:23,939 --> 00:32:29,820
I'm a mom, and I enjoy a nice,
glass of wine sometimes.

592
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,459
Roxanne literally took a sip of
the wine.

593
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,340
I want that for the record.
Like, that's not a prop.

594
00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:39,100
- We're going to bring in Jacqui Stafford.
- She has wine!

595
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:44,499
And they said, Wine? And I said,
Yeah. I need a hand.

596
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,580
I need several hands.
I need a glass of wine.

597
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:50,659
I don't know if you two have heard,
but we're having a tea party tonight,

598
00:32:50,739 --> 00:32:52,259
but we have wine in our teacups.

599
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,620
We have wine in our teacups.
We're having a tea party.

600
00:32:54,699 --> 00:32:57,179
Is it a tea is it a teacup,
or can it be a little bit bigger?

601
00:32:57,259 --> 00:32:58,699
- There you go!
- Yeah!

602
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,179
- All right. I love you.
- Love you.

603
00:33:00,499 --> 00:33:02,659
And we are going to go
shopping for wine.

604
00:33:02,739 --> 00:33:05,820
Did you not hear Pat say
we have to stay away from the wine?

605
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:09,019
Let me just bring my own bottle of wine,
and I will be here.

606
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,979
I happen to be right near my glass of
wine.

607
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,780
It's always a pleasure
to have you here.

608
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,780
I think I lost my wine.
Do you have your wine?

609
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,860
I've lost my wine
for the 100th time tonight.

610
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:19,659
I have my college T-shirts.

611
00:33:19,739 --> 00:33:22,140
I have my Dave
Matthews T-shirts that I loveÂ…

612
00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:24,939
- Crash!
- Listen, get me started.

613
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:28,939
- Into me.
- Okay. I'm number 41 all the way.

614
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,219
What's happening?
We almost had Dave Matthews wine

615
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,419
here at QVC years ago.
I think we should all go

616
00:33:36,499 --> 00:33:37,900
- to his Instagram.
- My gosh.

617
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,659
That's our show,
thanks so much for watching!

618
00:33:43,739 --> 00:33:45,259
These are my limes.
I love them,

619
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,540
and I love to present them
like this on my desk.

620
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,419
See you next week!
Good night!
