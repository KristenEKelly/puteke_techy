00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,729
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:31,729 --> 00:00:34,690
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight"!
I'm John Oliver.

3
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:38,129
Thank you so much for joining us.
It has been another busy week.

4
00:00:38,209 --> 00:00:40,330
The flagship of the Russian Navy sank,

5
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:43,769
the Kardashians returned to TV,
though I hadn't realized they'd left,

6
00:00:43,849 --> 00:00:45,930
and in Tennessee,
a state lawmaker

7
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,890
discussing a bill to criminalize
camping on public property

8
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,010
made this incredible argument.

9
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:54,209
I want to give you
a little history on homelessness.

10
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:58,890
19 and 10, Hitler decided
to live on the streets for a while.

11
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,010
So, for two years,
Hitler lived on the streets

12
00:01:02,089 --> 00:01:04,330
and practiced his oratory
and his body language

13
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,129
and how to connect
with the masses,

14
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,129
and then went on to lead a life
that got him in the history books, so.

15
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:12,610
A lot of these people,
it's not a dead end.

16
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,289
They can come out of these homeless
camps and have a productive life.

17
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,929
Or in Hitler's case,
a very unproductive life.

18
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:20,090
I support this bill.

19
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:24,209
The fuck are you talking about?
What is your point?

20
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:26,569
He's basically using the age-old,

21
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:29,530
"What if the homeless person
you passed on the street was Jesus?"

22
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,610
Except in his example,
the person is Hitler. Adolf Hitler.

23
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,810
And the homelessness
somehow only made him stronger.

24
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,890
But instead of going
down that wormhole,

25
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,129
we're going to focus
on the midterm elections.

26
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:42,409
They're happening in November,

27
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:45,170
and in the run-up are some
very important party primaries.

28
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,050
Pennsylvania's is a month away,

29
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:50,289
and it's a state that could well
determine who controls the Senate,

30
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:53,170
and its primary
was shaken up recently by this.

31
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:56,409
By the way,
I endorsed another person today,

32
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:58,170
Dr. Oz in Pennsylvania.

33
00:01:58,849 --> 00:01:59,849
Dr. Oz.

34
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:02,970
Great guy. A good man.

35
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,009
When you're in television for 18 years,
that's like a poll.

36
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,209
That means people like you.
But he's a great guy.

37
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,969
I hadn't heard that voice
in a while,

38
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,089
and to be honest,
I really haven't missed it.

39
00:02:15,809 --> 00:02:19,330
The first growl was like hearing
the sound of a cranking lawn mower

40
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,410
you know is about
to sexually harass you.

41
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:25,290
Now, as for his claim there
that "being on TV for a long time

42
00:02:25,369 --> 00:02:27,809
is like a poll showing
that people like you",

43
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,450
that is just not true,
believe me.

44
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,010
I've been on TV in this country
for 16 years now,

45
00:02:34,089 --> 00:02:37,450
and I still get YouTube comments
like, "I hope he stops soon",

46
00:02:37,929 --> 00:02:40,410
"Why is less funny
Mr. Bean so mad?"

47
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:44,450
and "The most unwatchable thing,
why does he always look sick?"

48
00:02:44,529 --> 00:02:45,890
And I don't know!

49
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,249
But yes,
Trump has endorsed Dr. Oz.

50
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,369
We've talked about Dr. Oz's daytime
snake-oil carnival in detail before,

51
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,450
so I didn't think his campaign
could surprise me, but it has.

52
00:02:57,529 --> 00:02:59,209
'Cause it's been a shitshow.

53
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,290
Starting with the fact that, for years,
he's lived in New Jersey,

54
00:03:02,369 --> 00:03:04,330
and his social media
still frequently shows him

55
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,089
at his North Jersey mansion.

56
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,809
He is running for office in a state
he doesn't seem to want to live in,

57
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,890
a savvy political move
known as the Eric Adams Special.

58
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,410
And when he wasn't in New Jersey,
he was often here in New York,

59
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,209
and the reason I know
that is his show filmed in this studio.

60
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,730
His offices were actually
right across the hall from ours.

61
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:26,050
I'm not saying that that is why,

62
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,249
after we made this prop
of a giant alligator giving the finger,

63
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,929
we set it up in our reception area
directly facing his offices,

64
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,570
but it did seem an appropriate way
for him to be greeted every morning.

65
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,730
Now, as if to overcompensate
for questions about his residency,

66
00:03:40,809 --> 00:03:44,570
Dr. Oz has been posting photos
and videos from all over Pennsylvania

67
00:03:44,649 --> 00:03:48,489
like this one of him and his wife
at a Pittsburgh Penguins game.

68
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,249
And let's take a moment to appreciate
his wife's expression there.

69
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,489
'Cause that is a look that just screams
"I'm in Pittsburgh with Dr. Oz."

70
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,369
He's also been going out
of his way to empathize

71
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,130
with the concerns of regular
Pennsylvanians, like this.

72
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:05,489
Thought I'd do some grocery shopping,
I'm at Wegner's

73
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,290
and my wife wants some vegetables
for crudité, right?

74
00:04:09,929 --> 00:04:13,649
Here's a broccoli, that's two bucks.
Not a ton of broccoli there.

75
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,090
Here's some asparagus,
that's $4, yup.

76
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:22,369
Carrots, that's four more dollars.
That's $10 of vegetables there.

77
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:26,369
And then we need some guacamole,
that's $4 more.

78
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,090
And she loves salsa, yeah,
there's salsa there, $6?

79
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,170
Must be a shortage of salsa.

80
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:37,009
Guys, that's $20 for crudité
and this doesn't include the tequila.

81
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,730
I mean, that's outrageous,
and we got Joe Biden to thank for this.

82
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,929
So, there is a lot to unpack there,

83
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:46,290
starting with the fact
that Dr. Oz went to a grocery store

84
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,730
dressed like Dexter
before a serial murder.

85
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,770
Then there's the fact
that he calls the store "Wegner's",

86
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,090
which is not its name.

87
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,970
That is a Redner's,
He would've known

88
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,530
if he'd simply looked
at the sign above his head.

89
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,650
And finally, what is that slap-dash
crudité nightmare right there?

90
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,170
No bell peppers? No celery?
And where's the hummus?

91
00:05:05,249 --> 00:05:08,489
A crudité platter requires
a thick dip, Mehmet.

92
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,449
If the dip ain't thick,
the dip don't stick!

93
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,050
I can only imagine his wife's face when
he brought those ingredients home,

94
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:18,610
except I don't actually have to,
'cause it looked something like this.

95
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:20,929
And that is not the only time

96
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:23,770
Dr. Oz has tried to connect
with voters over high prices.

97
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,129
One of his favorite things to do now
is show himself pumping gas on TikTok.

98
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:31,170
You know why gas is costing
so much money these days?

99
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:34,170
Because of Joe Biden's mismanagement
of our energy production.

100
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:36,569
I fill up my gas tank
almost every other day.

101
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,210
300 bucks a week. Not to mention
how much I'm spending on groceries.

102
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,009
The cost of living,
it's skyrocketing.

103
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,410
Gas prices, look at this, guys,
risen to the highest in 14 years.

104
00:05:46,489 --> 00:05:49,809
I always pick the middle.
It's almost five bucks. That's crazy!

105
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,009
Gas prices are a real concern.

106
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:57,129
But Dr. Oz
is worth over $100 million.

107
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,009
It's a little weird for him to act like
it's specifically straining his budget.

108
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,889
But maybe he's only posting
those videos

109
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:07,090
to push slightly less relatable
content further down his page.

110
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,689
Like, I don't know, this one.

111
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:20,689
Cool. That is Dr. Oz
wakesurfing with the caption

112
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,210
"Surfin' through hashtag Italy"
to the song "My Life Be Like".

113
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,249
And the truth is,
that is what his life be like,

114
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:30,650
because he's fucking rich, which
means he gets to do stuff like that.

115
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,569
But what he doesn't get to do, though,
is stand in front of gas pumps

116
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,329
and pretend he's personally affected
by those numbers.

117
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,929
Many Republicans actually doubt
Dr. Oz's conservative bona fides,

118
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:42,650
which may be why
he's tacked so hard to the right

119
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,009
on issues like gun rights and abortion,
posting this statement

120
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,329
that he supports "defending
the most vulnerable, the unborn".

121
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,610
Maybe that shift to the right, and the
Trump endorsement, will help him win.

122
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:55,970
But if that happens,
it'll be pretty remarkable.

123
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,569
Because for a man who's made a career
out of talking into a camera,

124
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,530
it is amazing how bad he's been
at doing that during this campaign.

125
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,650
It's honestly hard
to pick a low point,

126
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,650
but I do have to show you
this one video from last month,

127
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,650
where he seems,
best-case scenario, exhausted.

128
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,009
I wanna give a big shoutout to all the
Pennsylvania high school wrestlers

129
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,770
who are competing today in Hershey
at the PI-double-A state championships.

130
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:22,850
Penn State head wrestling coach
and American wrestling legend...

131
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,610
Cael Sanderson,
you all know who he is,

132
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:28,210
has said repeatedly
that Pennsylvania high school wrestling

133
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,730
is the best in the country.

134
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,889
And then if the state,
the Penn State program could actually,

135
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,770
you know, get all these folks,
they'd be unbeatable!

136
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,210
I agree.

137
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,770
I don't know
what I like most there,

138
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,650
the fact he seems to be performing
a Cameo no one requested,

139
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:45,170
the shoutout to "Cael Sanders,
y'll knoweeiz",

140
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,249
or the fact that that was posted
at 6:57 PM.

141
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:53,569
Did you pregame a high school wrestling
match, you deeply weird man?

142
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:56,730
I'm not saying that if Dr. Oz loses,

143
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,730
Pennsylvanians will have a better
option on the Republican ticket.

144
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:03,410
They won't. His main opponent
is this guy, Dave McCormick,

145
00:08:03,489 --> 00:08:05,970
the former CEO
for the world's biggest hedge fund.

146
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,410
But this campaign
has actually taught me something.

147
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:11,809
Because I talked a lot of shit
about "The Dr. Oz Show",

148
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:14,809
and I did that
because it was unremittingly terrible.

149
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:17,850
But what is now clear
is that I didn't appreciate

150
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:23,090
how hard his staff had to work
to make sure that it wasn't even worse.

151
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,090
He had to abandon his show
to go run for Senate,

152
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,329
and if any of his staff
are coming back to our office

153
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,489
in the coming weeks
to clear their stuff out,

154
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:34,290
we've actually left a new special
message for them on our alligator:

155
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,490
"I'm sorry, he seems
like a fucking nightmare".

156
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,849
Because he really does.

157
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,609
And now, this!

158
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,890
And Now...

159
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:47,650
The Profound Despair
of Hollow Chocolate Bunnies.

160
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,089
I remember being a kid
and biting into the Easter chocolate,

161
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,130
and it was hollow and being
so angry that I'd been duped.

162
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:56,290
When I was growing up,
we would have the hollow ones.

163
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,569
I was always disappointed
in the hollow ones.

164
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,170
Because you thought
they were solid?

165
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,770
You get it
and it left me empty.

166
00:09:02,849 --> 00:09:05,290
- So, are they solid?
- Yeah, right?

167
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,209
- Bite off the top of it, and it's...
- You don't want to see it hollow.

168
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,010
- No hollow chocolate bunnies for me.
- What's the point?

169
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,290
What's the point of eating air?

170
00:09:12,729 --> 00:09:14,290
Not one of the ones you got
when you were a kid

171
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,290
that was hollow on the inside
which was so disappointing.

172
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,569
It must be a solid chocolate bunny.
That's what we need.

173
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,969
Solid chocolate Easter bunny.

174
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,609
- A solid?
- Some of them are hollow.

175
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:27,569
So, then some of them
have things in them.

176
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,650
The solid...
Which, they're hard to find.

177
00:09:29,729 --> 00:09:32,770
- That's a good point there.
- I felt like I was denied this.

178
00:09:32,849 --> 00:09:34,890
- The solid.
- We got the hollow.

179
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:37,449
- A very particular child.
- And I wanted the solid.

180
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,209
- I'll buy myself one this year.
- Good for you!

181
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,209
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns police interrogations.

182
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,530
You're probably familiar with them,

183
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:55,689
they're a staple of countless TV shows,
including ones you might not expect.

184
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,089
Did you kill your father
with this axe?

185
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,569
No, I didn't.

186
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,969
Lie to me again and I'll arrest you
for murder, capisce?

187
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,050
Honey, I'd like a mineral water,
no ice.

188
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:08,410
And I'd like your balls
in a blender, but ain't life a bitch.

189
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,089
No, you're not understanding me!
I want you to confess!

190
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,370
- Confess?
- Confess!

191
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:19,290
Holy shit, Pinkie Pie's
about to fuck that dragon up.

192
00:10:19,969 --> 00:10:21,929
I was not expecting
a clip from "My Little Pony"

193
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,209
to look like a deleted scene
from "Training Day".

194
00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:28,209
But you can see why interrogation
scenes are so popular on TV:

195
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,809
they're inherently dramatic,

196
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,650
and can result in a confession,
moving the story along.

197
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:36,609
But it's not just audiences who
find them compelling, juries do, too.

198
00:10:36,689 --> 00:10:38,770
Confessions are viewed
as the "gold standard"

199
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:40,689
when it comes
to an indicator of guilt,

200
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:44,290
as they can apparently be more
persuasive than even DNA evidence.

201
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,250
Listen to these jurors in high-profile
trials explain the key evidence

202
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:49,969
that convinced them to convict.

203
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,809
We felt that no one
would confess three times

204
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,890
if they didn't do it.

205
00:10:54,969 --> 00:10:58,449
He could have continued to deny it.
If you did not hurt that baby,

206
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,650
you would go to your grave
saying "No, I didn't".

207
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,089
It was very hard to imagine
why anybody would make up

208
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:07,969
something that not only
incriminates them

209
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:13,530
but have, is full of details
that sound like they happened.

210
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:16,530
Confessions are wildly persuasive.

211
00:11:16,849 --> 00:11:19,849
Because we think that they're one of
those things that only guilty people do

212
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,130
you know,
like posting a Notes app apology,

213
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:24,410
or refusing to answer
any of Ronan Farrow's questions.

214
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,530
But here is the thing:
in all those jurors' cases,

215
00:11:27,609 --> 00:11:30,089
the confession
later turned out to be false.

216
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,890
That last juror was from the case
of the Central Park Five,

217
00:11:32,969 --> 00:11:35,089
or as they're now known,
the Exonerated Five.

218
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,969
Of all the convictions that have been
overturned through DNA testing,

219
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:42,050
29 percent
involved false confessions.

220
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,209
And you may find that
hard to believe.

221
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,890
'Cause it can be very hard
to comprehend

222
00:11:45,969 --> 00:11:48,890
how someone could confess
to something they didn't do.

223
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,729
Just watch Lester Holt
struggle to get his head around it,

224
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:54,929
while talking to a journalist
who covered a false confession case.

225
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,329
The more I investigated it,

226
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,849
the more I came to believe
that he might be telling me the truth.

227
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,729
There's not a shred of forensic
or physical evidence.

228
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,770
- But he confessed!
- Yeah.

229
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:08,010
You can't possibly fathom admitting
you did something that you didn't do.

230
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:09,209
Nobody does that.

231
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,250
Nobody would think
they're capable of doing it,

232
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,089
but the truth is,
a skilled interrogator

233
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,650
could probably get you or I to admit
we kidnapped the Lindbergh baby.

234
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,650
Exactly.
Honestly, a skilled interrogator

235
00:12:20,729 --> 00:12:23,569
could probably even get me to admit
that I am the Lindbergh baby.

236
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:26,449
It does kind of make sense,
considering that this body type

237
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,089
is a physique best described
as "92-year-old dead baby".

238
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:33,130
The truth is,
there are a number of reasons

239
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:35,849
an innocent person might confess
to something they didn't do,

240
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:39,609
and a lot of that comes down to what
happens in a police interrogation room.

241
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:42,089
So, tonight, let's talk
about police interrogations,

242
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,410
what tactics they use,

243
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,770
and how damaging they can be,
particularly for the innocent.

244
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,130
And let's start
with some history here.

245
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:51,729
It used to be, police could basically
torture people to get confessions,

246
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:54,890
a practice that came to be known
as using the "third degree".

247
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,290
But in 1936,

248
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,449
the Supreme Court declared
physical coercion unconstitutional,

249
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,089
meaning that police departments
had to adopt new techniques.

250
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,130
And it says something
that their early attempts to do this

251
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:07,290
featured some
pretty basic instructions,

252
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,050
like in this film from the Texas
Department of Public Safety.

253
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,250
Look the suspect in the eyes
to observe eye movements

254
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:16,209
and physical changes
that might indicate deception.

255
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,689
If you can't look him in the eyes watch
an imaginary X on the forehead or nose.

256
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,569
It's the same effect.

257
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,449
Once deception is detected,
you know you're on the right track.

258
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:31,890
Okay, hold on. Was drawing
the X really necessary there?

259
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:34,729
Were they genuinely worried
their officers wouldn't know

260
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:38,089
how to look at a forehead
without visual representation?

261
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,809
Because if they cannot spot
a forehead,

262
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:43,170
I'd argue maybe they should
not be trusted to spot a criminal.

263
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,170
But eventually, one particular
approach became the standard:

264
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,969
the Reid technique, named after
one of its creators, John E. Reid,

265
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,010
a former Chicago police officer
turned polygraph expert.

266
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:55,849
He formed a training firm
that now claims to have trained

267
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:58,050
"hundreds of thousands
of investigators"

268
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:02,209
and has "influenced nearly every aspect
of modern police interrogations".

269
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,329
The Reid technique's
become one of those things

270
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,530
that just culturally
comes with being a cop

271
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:08,329
like their fondness for donuts,

272
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,650
or their complicity in the perpetuation
of state-sponsored violence.

273
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:14,050
And when it comes
to questioning suspects,

274
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,689
there are two major phases
to the Reid technique:

275
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:20,130
the interview, where you determine
whether someone is a suspect,

276
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:23,250
and the interrogation,
where you try to get them to confess.

277
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,929
Now, in the interview stage,

278
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,130
the goal is to gauge how truthful
the answers you're getting are.

279
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:30,849
The approach
is similar to a lie-detector test:

280
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:34,170
you essentially start with some
basic questions to set a baseline,

281
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,050
then move to so-called
"behavior provoking questions",

282
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:41,449
when you analyze the suspect's verbal
and, crucially,non-verbal behavior.

283
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,250
This Reid training film,
for instance,

284
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:46,250
explains how "barrier postures"
like crossing your arms

285
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:47,929
are a sign that you are lying.

286
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,609
In the next two illustrations
we're going to see,

287
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:54,410
each subject moves
into a barriered posture

288
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,890
after they were asked
the critical question.

289
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:00,329
Why do you think Bob said
he saw you selling marijuana?

290
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,609
Come on, how should I know?

291
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,010
Who knows why people say things?
I sure don't.

292
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:10,969
Mark, have you ever thought
about sexually touching a child?

293
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:14,729
No, not seriously.

294
00:15:15,729 --> 00:15:18,449
Now, hold on.
First, let's acknowledge,

295
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,410
those are community theater actors
trying their hardest to convey guilt.

296
00:15:22,849 --> 00:15:24,890
And we should give
the first actress her flowers

297
00:15:24,969 --> 00:15:28,050
because she showed up to that
non-union gig ready to work.

298
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,809
As for this guy, he's doing a pretty
spot-on Kevin Spacey impression there

299
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,089
between the facial resemblance,
the haircut,

300
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,770
and the unconvincing denials
of sexual attraction to children,

301
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:38,170
he's really nailing it!

302
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:42,370
And I know that that looks dated,
but it's still very much in use.

303
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:46,250
That video is available for purchase
right now on Reid's website.

304
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:50,849
It was $100
and it was not remotely worth it.

305
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:55,250
But there is a big issue with relying
on that sort of behavioral analysis.

306
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,410
While Reid claims that investigators
trained in their technique

307
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,849
have shown an average accuracy of
83% in identifying deceptive subjects,

308
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:05,370
the truth is much less impressive,

309
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:07,890
as this retired
homicide investigator explains.

310
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,969
The Reid people admit that it's not
based on any science whatsoever,

311
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,969
just based on their own observations.

312
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:18,449
The real science says it's baloney.
It doesn't work.

313
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,770
When they've done experiments
with it,

314
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:27,849
they pretty much show that
the accuracy is like flipping a coin.

315
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,650
It's 50/50.

316
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,130
Right, it's basically chance.

317
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,370
It's got around the same
accuracy as a BuzzFeed quiz,

318
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:37,410
"Answer 17 Questions About Pizza

319
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,929
and We'll Tell You
Which Gilmore Girl You Are".

320
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:43,209
I'm a Rory? What the fuck
are you talking about, BuzzFeed?

321
00:16:43,609 --> 00:16:45,490
I'm a Lorelei all day.
I talk fast,

322
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:47,130
I carry the weight
of the world on my shoulders

323
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:49,209
and God,
do I look good in a peacoat.

324
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:53,290
And I have to tell you:
Reid & Associates will insist

325
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,609
that their interview technique is part
of an overall approach that works,

326
00:16:56,689 --> 00:17:02,130
if you follow all of the instructions
in their 400-page manual to the letter.

327
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:06,050
But this thing is so full of caveats
and outright contradictions,

328
00:17:06,129 --> 00:17:10,010
you can find support in it for nearly
any conclusion that you want to reach.

329
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:11,809
For instance,
when it comes to eye contact,

330
00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:14,889
it advises that "when a person
is being less than honest,

331
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,329
he may not maintain
direct eye contact",

332
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:20,690
but also, others
"may overcompensate by staring".

333
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,530
Meaning, if you have eyes,
you're basically fucked.

334
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,250
And I'm not saying that Reid
is the only problem here,

335
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:32,409
there's a whole industry of consultants
who train cops to spot liars.

336
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,569
But it's all bullshit.

337
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,930
"Years of research has demonstrated
that behavioral cues,

338
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,690
like eye-blinking and arm-crossing,

339
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,609
are simply not reliable
indicators of deception".

340
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:44,369
Which does make sense.

341
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,889
People move their bodies
in all sorts of ways

342
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,770
whether they are telling the truth
or not.

343
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:52,569
The only truly honest body movement
that humans are capable of

344
00:17:52,649 --> 00:17:55,530
is when someone accidentally
walks through a spider web.

345
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,970
That's it. Then, and only then,

346
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,809
are your gestures completely truthful
and void of pretense.

347
00:18:01,889 --> 00:18:02,889
Fucking shit!

348
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,930
So, thanks to this junk science,

349
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,369
police can essentially assure
themselves of their own certainties.

350
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,369
And if they have decided you
are guilty, you're in big trouble,

351
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,010
because that is when
the interrogation begins.

352
00:18:16,089 --> 00:18:18,450
And while they'll say
that they are looking for the truth,

353
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,409
Reid trains officers
to steer the conversation

354
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,329
away from anything
that's not a confession.

355
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:27,649
Many guilty people introduce
their denials with permission phrases

356
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,290
such as, "Can I say one thing?
Would you just listen to me?

357
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:33,649
But sir, if I could only explain".

358
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,649
When the interrogator
hears those phrases,

359
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,290
it's important to interject yourself
and stop the person from continuing,

360
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:44,690
because if you let him talk,
he'll say the words, "I didn't do it".

361
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:47,730
And the more often a person
says they didn't do it,

362
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:51,089
the more difficult it becomes for us
to get a confession.

363
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,250
Yes! The telltale signs of guilt:
"Would you please listen to me?"

364
00:18:56,329 --> 00:18:59,169
"Can I explain?"
and, "I'm telling you I didn't do it".

365
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,930
If an investigator is trying to get you
to confess, they can grind you down.

366
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,609
Interrogations can last from
a couple of hours to double-digits.

367
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,730
One study of false confessions
found that they came

368
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:13,450
after an average
of 16.3 hours of questioning.

369
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,649
Which can be utterly exhausting.

370
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,809
Innocent people
can wind up confessing

371
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:20,530
just to escape
the stress of that situation.

372
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:22,690
That was the case
with Robert Davis,

373
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,129
who at just 18
was suspected of double murder

374
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,569
and interrogated
for over five hours.

375
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:30,770
What can I say
that I did to get me out of this?

376
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:32,530
When will I go home?

377
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:37,369
When will I go home today?
Will I go home now?

378
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,169
I can't promise you.
Look, you work with me,

379
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,050
and I'm gonna do everything I can
to make sure your mom,

380
00:19:43,129 --> 00:19:44,649
and we can get you,
maybe get you home.

381
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,530
Robert, I'm gonna come straight out
and tell you what I'm getting.

382
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,930
Since you're not going to tell me.
You stabbed that woman.

383
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,490
- I stabbed her.
- You stabbed her, didn't you?

384
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,569
One or two times.

385
00:19:56,649 --> 00:19:59,369
Do you think by me telling you this,
it's gonna get me home tonight?

386
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,329
Tonight? Today? I doubt it.

387
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,609
Then why am I lying
about all this to you,

388
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,329
just so I can go home?

389
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:07,450
- You're not lying.
- I am lying to you.

390
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,569
I am lying to you
full front to your face.

391
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:13,609
He lied about stabbing someone,

392
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:17,409
then admitted that he'd lied,
but by that point, it was too late.

393
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:22,050
He actually went to prison for 13 years
before being exonerated.

394
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:25,409
The notion that people crack under
pressure and falsely confess

395
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,450
really shouldn't be that hard
to understand,

396
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,290
it's a concept
that even children's cartoons get.

397
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:32,649
Because remember that "My Little Pony"
scene from earlier?

398
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,129
This is how it continued.

399
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,530
No! No! No! No!

400
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,530
What do you want to hear?

401
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:41,369
Tell me what you want me to say
and I'll say it!

402
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:44,129
"Tell me what you want me to say
and I'll say it!

403
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,889
I kidnapped the Lindbergh baby!

404
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,409
Is that what you want to hear,
you pink psycho?"

405
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:53,089
And the thing is, people might assume
that, even if they falsely confess,

406
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,809
they can later recant, and the real
evidence will prevail and clear them.

407
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,809
But that's actually very unlikely.

408
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:03,290
As soon as the police get a confession,
thorough investigations tend to stop.

409
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:06,010
I'm going to answer the question that
you may have had for a while now:

410
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:09,889
why don't people just invoke their
constitutional right to an attorney?

411
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:14,329
The truth is, approximately 80 percent
waive their Miranda rights,

412
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:16,889
and willingly submit
to a police interrogation,

413
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,169
for a number
of understandable reasons.

414
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,409
Sometimes, people think, "I don't
need a lawyer, I didn't do anything".

415
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,770
Or they believe they're being brought
in as a witness, and not a suspect.

416
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:29,329
But not having a lawyer
makes you incredibly vulnerable.

417
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:33,450
Because a lawyer might clue you in
to an absolutely insane power

418
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,490
that police in America
have been given by the Supreme Court.

419
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:42,010
In the US, a detective can legally lie
about the evidence to a suspect.

420
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:46,250
It is lawful for detectives
to turn to a suspect and say,

421
00:21:46,649 --> 00:21:48,129
"You say you didn't do this,

422
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,649
but we've got your fingerprints
on the murder weapon",

423
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:54,809
or, "We have a victim
who had hair in her grasp,

424
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:57,129
and we tested the hair,
it's yours",

425
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:01,089
or, "The shoe prints we found
at the scene are yours,"

426
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,450
or, "That polygraph
you wanted to take, you failed it."

427
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,609
It's true. The police in this country
can flat-out lie to you,

428
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:11,490
to make you think
you have no choice but to confess.

429
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:14,329
And some of the lies
they tell are simply ridiculous.

430
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:17,129
An investigator in Florida
told a suspect they had "a laser,

431
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,210
the kind that you shoot
on Star Wars",

432
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:22,409
and with it, they could
actually lift fingerprints off bodies.

433
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:25,889
A technology that,
to be clear, does not exist.

434
00:22:26,329 --> 00:22:27,930
Although, having said that,
I'm now pretty sure

435
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,730
that we're one bad pitch meeting
away from the Star Wars laser

436
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:33,649
getting its own 10-episode series
on Disney+.

437
00:22:34,329 --> 00:22:37,730
The laser will be voiced by Oscar Isaac
and we'll all cum.

438
00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:43,089
Now, allowing the police
to lie to suspects is crazy.

439
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,690
Most countries do not allow it,
and for good reason.

440
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:49,889
It is far too powerful a tool.
Remember Robert Davis?

441
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,369
It might still be hard for you
to imagine

442
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,569
why he confessed to doing
something that he didn't do,

443
00:22:55,649 --> 00:22:59,050
but look at what the interrogator
was claiming in that room.

444
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:00,930
I've got evidence out the ass.

445
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,809
Dust is made up of mostly
of human dead skin.

446
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,730
That can be picked up.
That DNA.

447
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,369
I'm not gonna be able
to keep you from the worst, Robert.

448
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,930
If you don't talk to me,
I can't keep you from the worst.

449
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:15,809
- I wasn't there.
- Robert, you were. You were there.

450
00:23:15,889 --> 00:23:17,290
The evidence
shows you were there.

451
00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:20,530
The evidence shows it.
I can't lie about the evidence.

452
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:25,809
"I can't lie about the evidence",
he lied as he lied about the evidence,

453
00:23:25,889 --> 00:23:29,690
and did it gesturing with all the
theatrical nuance of a high schooler

454
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,849
auditioning for "A Few Good Men".

455
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,690
The overwhelming pressure
of a police interrogation,

456
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:37,369
coupled with their ability
to invent evidence,

457
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,809
can actually make people
question their own memories.

458
00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:41,970
That happened
with Christopher Tapp,

459
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:45,089
who served 20 years in prison
for a murder he did not commit,

460
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:48,690
and was heavily manipulated
during his interrogation.

461
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:53,329
I wasn't there. The way I think you're
telling it to me is like I was there.

462
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:56,490
The police told me a few times
if there was something that horrific,

463
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:59,490
you would definitely hide it
and it would go in your subconscious.

464
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:04,050
It's like me, some of the brutal stuff
that we see out on the streets,

465
00:24:04,129 --> 00:24:06,730
my mind shuts down on me
because I don't want to remember it.

466
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,970
I started second-guessing myself
during all this.

467
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:13,290
I started to not believe in myself
or who I was.

468
00:24:13,649 --> 00:24:15,970
I don't know, because right now
everything I've been saying,

469
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,409
what I think is right in my head,
it's been wrong.

470
00:24:19,129 --> 00:24:22,250
That is terrible,
and it's more than a little infuriating

471
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:25,050
how that investigator convinces him
of doubting his own memory

472
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:27,530
by making it seem
like it happens all the time.

473
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:30,129
You half expect him to say,
"You know how you can't remember

474
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,530
if it was the Berenstein Bears
or Berenstain Bears?

475
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:35,849
Or if Shaq was in a movie
called "Shazaam"

476
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,889
or maybe it was Sinbad and the movie
was actually called "Kazaam?"

477
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:41,730
That's what your brain's doing
right now but with murder!

478
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:43,329
Brains are weird, huh?"

479
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,329
All these tactics
are incredibly manipulative,

480
00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:48,930
and they work
especially well on certain people.

481
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:52,250
Research shows false confessions
were a factor in 34 percent

482
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:54,970
of cases in which children
were wrongly convicted,

483
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:58,690
and a stunning 69 percent of cases
in which people with mental illness

484
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,690
or intellectual disabilities
were later exonerated.

485
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:05,169
And look, there are some limits
on what police can do.

486
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,930
Some judges won't allow
a confession if the police

487
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,250
promised you leniency
in exchange for it.

488
00:25:10,329 --> 00:25:13,609
But many cops
walk right up to that line

489
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,369
by suggesting a confession
might reduce prison time

490
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,649
or spare you the death penalty.

491
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,849
You just saw
that happen with Robert Davis,

492
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,609
when that officer told him
he could "keep him from the worst".

493
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,129
Also, police are told
not to feed you information

494
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,329
about the crime
that is not publicly available,

495
00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:30,809
as it's obviously damning
for a jury to hear

496
00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:33,649
that you knew details
only the guilty party would know.

497
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,050
But that happens all the time, too.

498
00:25:36,129 --> 00:25:40,409
One study of DNA exonerations found
that 94 percent of false confessions

499
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:43,450
were contaminated
by allegedly inside information.

500
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:47,770
And the thing is, even if police
engage in these tactics, crucially,

501
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:52,609
the jury may only see the confession,
not the interrogation that led up to it.

502
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:57,010
30 states require the recording
of interrogations at all.

503
00:25:57,089 --> 00:26:01,210
And in the rest, it's up to the police,
who might only record the confession.

504
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,369
That's it.

505
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:07,129
And you just cannot get the full story
from seeing one short clip.

506
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,569
Imagine if the only clip

507
00:26:08,649 --> 00:26:11,530
you'd ever seen of the show
"One Tree Hill" was this.

508
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,889
Dr. Jameson,
please call extension 2524.

509
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,010
Dr. Casper to the ER.

510
00:26:18,569 --> 00:26:20,010
Dr. Capser to the ER.

511
00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:25,050
Nurse Henderson to Admitting.

512
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,409
Nurse Henderson to Admitting.

513
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,809
Do you want to know
what "One Tree Hill" is about?

514
00:26:42,889 --> 00:26:45,329
It's about a high school
basketball team.

515
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:47,569
But you'd have no way
of knowing that from that clip.

516
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:48,889
All you would know
is that it contained

517
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:52,450
the most perfect 20 seconds
of television that has ever existed.

518
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,770
The problem with police interrogations
right now

519
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:58,530
is the same problem that we have
with policing at large,

520
00:26:58,609 --> 00:27:00,930
they're emboldened
to act however they'd like

521
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,169
in a system where they hold
an undue amount of power,

522
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:07,369
with very few protections for civilians,
especially the most vulnerable.

523
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:11,649
There can be little to no consequences
for extracting a false confession.

524
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,089
Just listen to this man,

525
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:16,250
who was a 19-year-old
former special education student

526
00:27:16,329 --> 00:27:18,930
at the time of his arrest
for raping and murdering a woman.

527
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:22,369
After being interrogated
over the course of four days,

528
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:26,609
including, fun fact, two polygraphs
conducted by Reid & Associates,

529
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,409
he confessed under pressure,

530
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:33,210
and spent nearly 20 years in prison
until finally being exonerated by DNA.

531
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:38,649
The officers that worked on my case,
as well as state's attorneys,

532
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,290
they've all retired with pension,
full pension.

533
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,329
There was no repercussion,
no retribution,

534
00:27:44,649 --> 00:27:46,369
no criminal charges, nothing.

535
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:50,010
They actually exceeded in their job.

536
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,409
They retired as captains,
majors, lieutenants.

537
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,089
The head state's attorney,
Michael Waller, retired,

538
00:27:57,169 --> 00:27:59,250
and they gave him
a plaque for good job.

539
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,089
That is maddening.

540
00:28:01,569 --> 00:28:05,010
That state attorney certainly
doesn't deserve a "good job" plaque,

541
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:07,169
unless it came with another
drop-down plaque

542
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,809
that read "at fucking up innocent
people's lives you monumental asshole".

543
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:15,089
And while I've spent tonight showing
you people who were exonerated,

544
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:17,450
there are still
many incarcerated people

545
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:21,290
fighting convictions that have every
hallmark of a false confession,

546
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:23,730
like Brendan Dassey
from "Making a Murderer,"

547
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:27,409
who was 16 when he confessed to
a murder that he could not describe,

548
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:31,169
and Melissa Lucio, whose incredibly
manipulative interrogation

549
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,849
we featured in our
Wrongful Convictions piece,

550
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:37,290
and who is set to be executed
in just 10 days.

551
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:40,889
So, what can we do?
We should absolutely require

552
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,050
all interrogations
be recorded in their entirety

553
00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:47,329
so juries have the full context
of what happened in that room.

554
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:51,569
We should also make it illegal
for police to lie to suspects.

555
00:28:51,649 --> 00:28:55,250
Because it is madness that
they're currently allowed to do that.

556
00:28:55,329 --> 00:28:58,050
And there's actually a growing
movement for some reform here.

557
00:28:58,129 --> 00:29:02,129
These three states have now banned
police from lying to juvenile suspects,

558
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:05,930
and New York has introduced legislation
that would ban lying to all suspects

559
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,889
and require courts to evaluate
the reliability of confession evidence

560
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,690
before allowing it to be used.

561
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:14,730
And that should be adopted
absolutely everywhere.

562
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:17,690
And if you're thinking,
"Hold on, John, how will investigators

563
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:21,409
get guilty people to confess
if they can't intimidate or lie to them?"

564
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:27,250
Not to be a total bitch, but their job
is literally to investigate,

565
00:29:27,329 --> 00:29:29,609
so maybe they could
try doing some of that.

566
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:34,530
You can productively interrogate
someone without lying to them.

567
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:37,809
The U.K. now uses something
called "the Peace method",

568
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:39,730
where they ask open-ended questions

569
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:41,889
and let the suspect
give their own account.

570
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:46,290
And I am not saying that that system
is perfect, it clearly isn't.

571
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:48,770
Among other things,
they still haven't gotten the Queen

572
00:29:48,849 --> 00:29:50,609
to confess to killing Diana
on camera.

573
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,129
But it's at least a start.

574
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,569
And in the meantime, there's actually
a lot of cultural conditioning

575
00:29:56,649 --> 00:29:59,809
regarding police interrogations
that we need to start undoing.

576
00:29:59,889 --> 00:30:03,649
Because think about it, how many
dramas have you seen on TV

577
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,730
where roughing up the bad guy
led to solving the crime?

578
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:09,210
How many shows have
there been where the bad guy

579
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:11,770
seemed guilty
and the officer's gut feeling

580
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:14,050
was confirmed
by the end of the episode?

581
00:30:14,129 --> 00:30:16,290
Our misconceptions
about police interrogations

582
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:18,569
have been hammered
in by crime dramas,

583
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:20,649
and they've been hammered
in deep.

584
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:23,970
And perhaps one small way
to help undo that damage

585
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:26,970
is for shows to present
a slightly more accurate picture

586
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:29,050
of what can really happen
in that room.

587
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:33,290
This fall, meet two tough cops.

588
00:30:34,129 --> 00:30:35,849
Expert interrogators...

589
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:36,930
Knock knock!

590
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,169
Who won't take no for an answer.

591
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:45,690
You son of a bitch.
You're guilty, you dirty rat bastard!

592
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:49,730
- What are you talking about?
- The murder in the alley.

593
00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:51,250
- I didn't do it.
- No!

594
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:54,809
- I can't hear that.
- We cannot hear you say that.

595
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,169
They're highly trained.

596
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,569
- You're lying!
- No, I'm not.

597
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,569
You looked away.
That is lying.

598
00:31:02,649 --> 00:31:04,770
Now you're staring.
That's lying, too.

599
00:31:05,889 --> 00:31:06,970
More lies.

600
00:31:07,329 --> 00:31:08,970
And incredibly skilled.

601
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,930
- What are you doing?
- I'm making eye contact.

602
00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:13,329
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

603
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:16,849
- Are you looking at my forehead?
- No.

604
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:20,730
And they'll say anything
to get what they need.

605
00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:23,210
- Have you seen "Rogue One?"
- The "Star Wars" movie?

606
00:31:23,569 --> 00:31:27,770
- That "Star Wars" film.
- I think I saw it once, yeah.

607
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:29,450
You're probably
familiar with lightsabers.

608
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,089
Probably less familiar
with the fact that we have them,

609
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:35,490
and they have the ability to pull DNA
from a dead body with a single...

610
00:31:37,849 --> 00:31:39,609
I cannot lie about this.

611
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,010
It's true.
He can't lie about the...

612
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,129
And I mean anything.

613
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,849
You ever get to work and not
remember any of your commute?

614
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,730
Maybe it was like that,
but with murder.

615
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:53,730
Is this dress black
and blue or gold and white?

616
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,730
You've got two choices!

617
00:31:55,809 --> 00:31:59,369
Confess to one count of murder two,
or two counts of murder one!

618
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:05,089
You've got to help us help you.
Help us help you help us convict you.

619
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:08,970
- Murderer says what?
- What?

620
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,809
That counts! That counts.

621
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:16,210
No!
Are you allergic to your own victim?

622
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:20,089
Did you just blow a dead body
on me?

623
00:32:20,169 --> 00:32:21,250
Yes.

624
00:32:21,329 --> 00:32:24,809
I got evidence coming out
of every hole of my body!

625
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:27,770
- Those can't be the only choices!
- You've got two choices!

626
00:32:27,849 --> 00:32:29,490
Those can't be the only choices!

627
00:32:29,569 --> 00:32:31,970
What about the one count of murder
two, or two counts of murder one!

628
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,609
I want a third choice!

629
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:36,809
One count of murder two,
or two counts of murder one?

630
00:32:39,849 --> 00:32:43,329
Guys, it's been
15 and a half hours.

631
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:47,490
I can't take much more of this.

632
00:32:48,889 --> 00:32:51,329
If you help me out a little bit,

633
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:54,649
maybe I can make sure that you get
to sleep in your own bed tonight.

634
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,649
Fine. I did it.

635
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,290
Yes!

636
00:33:00,369 --> 00:33:01,569
Ace in the hole, baby.

637
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,849
Sorry about the delay, fellas.
Here's your perp.

638
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,369
We don't need any more suspects.

639
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,690
The one you brought us yesterday
just confessed.

640
00:33:10,329 --> 00:33:12,490
But this was the guy you were supposed
to interrogate yesterday.

641
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,089
Who the hell is this?

642
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,450
I just came in here
to charge my phone.

643
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,210
That's perfect!

644
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:35,770
Look at that!

645
00:33:40,369 --> 00:33:41,730
You're still going to jail.

646
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,690
- Put him in the cuffs.
- My pleasure.

647
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:51,089
His phone battery dies
and he goes to prison.

648
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:54,210
"I'm gonna charge my phone
in an interrogation room."

649
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:56,490
Who does that?

650
00:33:57,649 --> 00:33:58,849
Don't forget your phone!

651
00:34:02,329 --> 00:34:03,369
