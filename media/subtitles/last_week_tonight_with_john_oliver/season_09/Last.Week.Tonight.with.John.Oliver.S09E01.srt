00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,360
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,400
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight".
I'm John Oliver.

3
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,840
Thank you so much for joining us.

4
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,360
We are back, and sadly no time
to go into everything

5
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,120
that we've missed
since we've been away.

6
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,000
We don't even have time to get
into news from this week,

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,760
from the Queen getting Covid.

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,520
to Putin continuing his whole "will he,
won't he" act about invading Ukraine.

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,760
Instead, we're going to start tonight
in Canada.

10
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,520
It is very much the Santa Claus
of countries in that it's jolly,

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,880
northern, and absolutely filled
with reindeer jizz.

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,720
We're fucking back!

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,880
Over the last few weeks,

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,000
Canada's capital has had its
downtown besieged by protestors.

15
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,960
Ottawa becomes a global front line
of frustration

16
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,000
over vaccine restrictions.

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,120
Hundreds of trucks are blockading
the area around Parliament.

18
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,080
We're sitting here just because we
think we're doing the right thing here.

19
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,120
Here's the thing about that.
Sometimes, sitting in your car

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,120
is doing the right thing, like
if you're waiting for your McFlurry,

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,760
or dropping off
your kid's baseball glove,

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,760
or screaming in a Trader Joe's
parking lot

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,840
because that was supposed
to be your one hour alone

24
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,680
and you had to spend it going to get
that fucking glove

25
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,600
even though you asked Brendan three
times if he had it before you left,

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,920
and if you don't just sit here for
a minute, you might do a murder!

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,160
And look, I will say, broadly, there is
nothing wrong with civil disobedience.

28
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,960
It's often the most powerful way
to bring about change.

29
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,200
But occupying a capital city
for nearly a month over objections

30
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,200
to vaccine mandates for truckers,

31
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,960
especially when both
the Canadian Trucking Alliance

32
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,880
and Ontario Trucking Association
have disavowed the protests,

33
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,400
and "roughly 90% of truck drivers
have received their vaccines",

34
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,160
feels, at best, an over-response.

35
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,400
And it sure seems
like there's more going on here.

36
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,280
Because the protestors
are now demanding

37
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,120
an end to all Covid
restrictions nationwide

38
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,880
and the resignation of Justin Trudeau.

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,520
And they've been cheered on
by U.S. conservatives,

40
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,920
with Fox devoting numerous segments
to approving coverage of them,

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,200
and one of the convoy's leaders,
Pat King, being interviewed

42
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,800
by Stuart Varney.

43
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,360
But it is worth noting that some
of the organizers of this protest

44
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,760
have strong views about issues
other than Covid mandates.

45
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,960
One of the convoy's de facto
spokespeople has been Tamara Lich,

46
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,360
who has ties to far-right groups
in Canada

47
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,080
and has been a leader
within the Wexit movement,

48
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,640
which I know sounds like the official
campaign to have Westies refuse

49
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,560
to participate in the National Dog Show

50
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,960
after years of being unjustly
overlooked,

51
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,200
but actually refers to a western
separatist movement

52
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,960
that's called "for Canada's prairie
provinces to secede".

53
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,520
And quick, fun side note here, Lich also
sings with a band called Blind Monday.

54
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,080
Would you like to hear them perform?

55
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, too fucking bad.
You're going to.

56
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,880
Get up, come on get down
with the sickness,

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,600
You mother get up, come on,
get down with the sickness,

58
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,240
You fucker, get up, come on,
get down with the sickness,

59
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,800
Madness is the gift
that's been given to me.

60
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,720
Cool. But I will say this.

61
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,600
It is hard to think of a song more
thematically appropriate to her cause

62
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,680
than "Get Down with the Sickness",

63
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,040
except for, maybe,
"My Heart Will Go On",

64
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,840
in that it's both Canadian
and inextricably linked

65
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,680
with completely avoidable tragedy.

66
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,880
Now, as for Pat King, the guy who
Fox excitedly interviewed,

67
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,120
you don't need to look deep
into his past to find

68
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,160
some pretty inflammatory views.

69
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,640
What there is, is there's an endgame.

70
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,560
It's called depopulation of the
Caucasian race or the Anglo-Saxon.

71
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,600
And that's what the goal is,

72
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,200
is to depopulate
the Anglo-Saxon race

73
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,400
because they are the ones
with the strongest bloodlines.

74
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,560
We'll leave it at that because then
we get into a whole different topic.

75
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,040
Holy shit,
there is a lot going on there.

76
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,680
Not least of which is that you're about
to bring the Anglo-Saxon numbers

77
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,160
down by at least one, Pat,

78
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,320
if you don't keep your eyes
on the fucking road there.

79
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,000
But also, let's just acknowledge,

80
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,680
"strongest bloodline" is a remarkably
bold claim from a man

81
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,600
who looks like someone
is slowly poisoning Guy Fieri.

82
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Now, in recent days, police have
been arresting protestors

83
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,200
and clearing blockades.

84
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,240
So, the protest may actually
be winding down.

85
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,280
But unfortunately, like Covid
and the unvaccinated,

86
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,640
some of the ideas behind it
are massively infectious.

87
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,440
There is talk of a U.S. version
of it happening,

88
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,720
and copycat protests have already
taken place in France, Australia,

89
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
and New Zealand,

90
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,520
where they had a novel way
of trying to clear the obstruction.

91
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,360
Lines of vehicles rolled into
New Zealand's capital city last week,

92
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,440
blocking streets near Parliament.

93
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,880
Officials in New Zealand using softer
tactics to get people to move on

94
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,440
playing songs from loudspeakers
like "You're Beautiful",

95
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,440
from James Blunt, and music
from Disney movies,

96
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,720
even Barry Manilow.

97
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,680
Come on, New Zealand.

98
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,800
Playing James Blunt and Barry Manilow
clearly is not going to cut it here.

99
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,360
You're not going to move on people
this angry with the actions

100
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,320
of a bad wedding DJ.

101
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,600
Besides, as we all now know, if you
really want to get a crowd to disperse,

102
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,840
you don't go with Disney
or James Blunt.

103
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,040
Take it from me, you go with the only
song guaranteed to clear a room.

104
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,400
And it's this.

105
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,640
Exactly. 100% successful.
And now, this.

106
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:50,560
And now, the Existential Despair
of ABC 3 Morning News.

107
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,360
4:30 in the morning.
Let's get this day together.

108
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,800
Good morning, I'm Jared Willets.

109
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,160
That was a lot of pressure,
"let's get this day together".

110
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,040
Let's just get into this day.

111
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,120
Every now and then, Laura,
I wind up in the attic

112
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,360
and there hanging on a post
is my motorcycle jacket.

113
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,320
Classic leather. Classic styling.
I look at it and I sigh.

114
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,680
Chronic pain, my friends, is no joke.
But let's not talk about me.

115
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,120
- Forfeiting.
- Does that sound funny?

116
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,520
You might have to forfeit.
Nobody wants to go that way.

117
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,640
All right.

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,960
- How about you, you okay?
- Fine.

119
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,960
What a lovely enclosure they have,
don't you think?

120
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,080
Yeah. Well, you know, even
a pretty cage is a cage, Laura.

121
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,400
Look at that face. You may start
your Wednesday now with a smile.

122
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,400
- Baby animals.
- I'm smiling.

123
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,440
I always like it when you
ignore me, Laura. That's nice.

124
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,160
- That is, isn't it?
- Yeah, I like it.

125
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,800
People at home like it as well.

126
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,000
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns school.

127
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,560
It's the only setting in which a child
dissecting a frog

128
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,520
is not an immediate red flag.

129
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,200
We teach kids a lot in school,

130
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,880
from reading, to long division,

131
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,040
to how to play the fucking recorder
for some reason.

132
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,200
But recently, there's been a lot
of concern over one particular thing

133
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,280
that people worry kids are learning.

134
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,400
Critical race theory is being taught
in our schools.

135
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,920
Critical race theory is bunk.

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,840
Critical race theory is a lie.
From the first word to the last.

137
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,560
Racist critical race theory.

138
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,200
Critical race theory in the schools
and the wokeness.

139
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,800
Let me tell you right now,
critical race theory is bigoted,

140
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,560
it is a lie,
and it is every bit as racist

141
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,800
as the Klansmen in white sheets.

142
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,200
I do not like that Ted Cruz man.

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,960
I do not like him shouting "Klan".

144
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,120
I do not like him in a room.
I do not like him in Cancun.

145
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,880
I do not like him playing ball.
I do not like his face at all.

146
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,840
I wish he'd lose his cushy job.

147
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,440
That man Ted Cruz is a fucking knob.

148
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,960
But here's the thing, it is true,

149
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,680
you have probably heard people yelling
about critical race theory on TV

150
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,040
for more than a year now.

151
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,800
And people have been listening
to that noise,

152
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,840
especially judging by what's been
happening at school board meetings

153
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,960
across the country.

154
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,000
- Resign!
- Resign, cowards!

155
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,000
The western culture and values
that brought forth Christianity

156
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,200
and the founding documents
are being called evil and racist.

157
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,160
I am not co-parenting
with the government.

158
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,280
It is not your job to force
these ideas onto my child.

159
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,040
The narrative in this country
is that we're all inherently racist,

160
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,480
and I'm about sick of it.

161
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,720
It's a Marxist ideology
and we all know it.

162
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,480
All these lessons have the intent
to make our children feel disgust

163
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,720
towards our nation.

164
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,600
This country isn't even
a racist country.

165
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,840
We elected Obama for two terms.

166
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,160
Wait, hold on.

167
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,240
America can't be racist
because of Obama?

168
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,520
I don't know if you remember
the 2008 election,

169
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,160
but things got pretty racist back then.

170
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,160
People kept saying he was born
in Kenya,

171
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,840
people said he was a secret Muslim,
and then a few years later,

172
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,640
we elected that people president.

173
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,640
So, let's just agree to disagree
on that one, shall we?

174
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,120
That first meeting was
in Loudoun County, Virginia,

175
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,240
and it got so out of hand
that the meeting was shut down early,

176
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,640
and one guy passionately railing
against CRT was arrested

177
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,000
for trespassing, only to pop up
on Tucker Carlson the very next day.

178
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,080
So clearly, a lot of people are getting
very mad about critical race theory.

179
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,680
And instinctively, you probably know
it's a manufactured panic.

180
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,920
But the fact is, the fear around it
is having real effects.

181
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,680
Last year, Glenn Youngkin won
the governor's race in Virginia,

182
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,280
after repeatedly promising that
on his first day in office,

183
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,880
he'd ban CRT
from being taught in schools.

184
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,120
Multiple states have passed laws
outlawing the teaching of it.

185
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,360
And Republicans are likely to make it
a major focus of the midterms.

186
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,720
When it comes to critical race theory,
think of it like Rihanna's pregnancy.

187
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,720
Even if you think it has nothing to do
with you, believe me,

188
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,040
you're going to be hearing
a lot about it this year.

189
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,520
So, given that, we thought tonight,
we'd take a step back

190
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,440
and look at what critical race theory
is and isn't,

191
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,160
why the panic around it has spread,

192
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,200
and what the consequences might be
for everyone involved.

193
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,000
And I realize some of you may
already know what CRT is.

194
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,600
After all, explainers on it have become
one of the most common sights

195
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,200
on the internet, along
with mediocre Wordle scores,

196
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,960
and ugly monkey JPEGs sold by
and for dipshits.

197
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,720
But many are still very confused.

198
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,120
A recent survey found that an
overwhelming majority of U.S. residents

199
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,400
have a hard time articulating
exactly what CRT is.

200
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,320
And that even goes for some of those
who've been yelling about it.

201
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,760
I've never figured out what critical
race theory is, to be totally honest,

202
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,280
after a year of talking about it.

203
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,640
They're teaching that some races
are morally superior to others,

204
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,200
that some are inherently sinful
and some are inherently saintly

205
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,560
and that's immoral to teach that
'cause it's wrong.

206
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,920
I don't know if I've ever seen a person
confidently complain about something

207
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,760
just seconds after admitting
they didn't know shit about it.

208
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,120
Look, I've never figured out how
a car engine works, to be honest,

209
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,360
but there's a chimpanzee
under the hood turning a crank

210
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,840
and when you press the accelerator
it pokes him with a sharp stick

211
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,040
and makes him crank faster,

212
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,280
and it's immoral to do that
because it's wrong.

213
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,920
But obviously, that is not
what critical race theory is.

214
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,120
It's the name given to a body
of legal scholarship

215
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,560
that began in the 1970s that attempted
to understand why racism

216
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,280
and inequality persisted
after the civil rights movement.

217
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,200
The core idea is that racism is not
merely the product of individual bias

218
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,040
or prejudice, but also something
that is embedded in legal systems

219
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,280
and policies.

220
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,760
As for Tucker's notion that it teaches
that some races are superior

221
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,000
or, that parents claim that it teaches
kids to hate America,

222
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,720
none of that is remotely true.

223
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,680
As Kimberle Crenshaw, one
of CRT's leading scholars, points out.

224
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,640
Critical race theory just says let's pay
attention to what has happened

225
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,880
in this country,

226
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,840
and how what has happened in this
country is continuing to create

227
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,640
differential outcomes
so we can become that country

228
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,120
that we say we are.

229
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,440
So, critical race theory
is not antipatriotic.

230
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,400
In fact, it is more patriotic
than those who are opposed to it.

231
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,240
Because we believe in the 13th,
and the 14th, and the 15th Amendment.

232
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,520
We believe in the promises of equality,
and we know we can't get there

233
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,080
if we can't confront and talk honestly
about inequality.

234
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,520
Yeah, she's right. And incidentally,

235
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,880
if you just found yourself there
wondering

236
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,960
what the 13th, 14th, and 15th
Amendments are,

237
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,080
that alone might be a good sign we don't
talk about this stuff in schools enough.

238
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,880
And to be clear, CRT
is graduate-level legal theory,

239
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,320
so unless your five- year-old
is currently pursuing a law degree,

240
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,840
they're not reading Kimberle Crenshaw.

241
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,840
But critics of it argue that the ideas
behind CRT are being taught

242
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,120
in schools, and often present
a hyperbolically distorted version

243
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,560
of what those ideas are.

244
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,000
And a key person here is this man,

245
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,600
a conservative activist
named Christopher Rufo.

246
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,920
He claims CRT is actually
"a revolutionary program"

247
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,640
"that would overturn the principles
of the Declaration"

248
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,640
"and destroy the remaining structure
of the Constitution",

249
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,160
which it just isn't. It isn't that.

250
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,640
But in the wake
of the George Floyd protests,

251
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,320
just as America was beginning
to grapple with systemic racism,

252
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,280
Fox News began featuring Rufo
on-air a lot

253
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,680
as part of their efforts to swing
that pendulum back, hard.

254
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,560
And in one appearance, he pointed
to diversity trainings in government

255
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,600
as evidence of CRT's influence,

256
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,560
and he spoke directly to President
Trump through the camera

257
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,760
about what he wanted to see happen.

258
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,120
The president at the White House,
it's within their authority and power

259
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,280
to immediately issue
an executive order

260
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,600
abolishing critical race theory
trainings from the federal government.

261
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,360
I call on the president to immediately
issue this executive order

262
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,920
and stamp out this destructive,
divisive, pseudoscientific ideology

263
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,600
at its root.

264
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,440
Now, did Trump see that? I dunno,
is the Pope a Catholic?

265
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,560
Is the reason Big died the fact that
Carrie didn't call 911 fast enough?

266
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,080
The answer to all those questions
is yes, and also,

267
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,720
she was right not to do it.
No big loss.

268
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,360
Because Mark Meadows,
Trump's chief of staff,

269
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,760
has since revealed President Trump
saw that interview,

270
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,760
and when Rufo said, "I call on the
president to immediately issue"

271
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,000
"this executive order," quote,
"that's what we did".

272
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,240
Which is weird! There should
be more steps than that.

273
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,240
It shouldn't just go "one, yell
your wish at the president,"

274
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,880
then "two, it happens".

275
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,640
Ideally, you want an executive branch
that's a little more complicated

276
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,480
than fucking Siri.

277
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,160
And with that, CRT, or, crucially,
Rufo's definition of it,

278
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,880
was suddenly absolutely everywhere.

279
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,560
Fox News kept pushing it, mentioning
the term "critical race theory"

280
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,880
nearly 5000 times last year alone.

281
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,400
And the network zeroed in
on its supposed use in schools,

282
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,440
with Rufo telling Fox's audience
that CRT has "really become"

283
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,360
"the default ideology of the public
education system".

284
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,400
And what Rufo has been cleverly doing
is cherry-picking the worst examples

285
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,800
that he can find of lessons
in classrooms or training materials

286
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,280
for teachers, and saying,
"that is CRT".

287
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,160
And he's openly admitted
that he's been engaged

288
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,560
in a deliberate branding exercise,

289
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,000
tweeting, "we have successfully frozen
their brand, critical race theory,"

290
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,760
"into the public conversation"

291
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,400
"and are steadily driving up
negative perceptions".

292
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,880
"The goal is to have the public read
something crazy in the newspaper"

293
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,640
"and immediately think
critical race theory".

294
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,680
And the thing is,
it fucking worked.

295
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,640
Because whenever you hear CRT now,

296
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,680
you are not hearing about
the academic discipline.

297
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,720
You're hearing about a category
so broad,

298
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,600
it encompasses both the craziest thing
in the newspaper

299
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,720
and also, crucially, any conversation
about race

300
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
that someone does not want to have.

301
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,360
And look, I am not saying discussing
race in a classroom is easy,

302
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,560
or even always done well.

303
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,360
Experts in this field
will readily admit that.

304
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,840
Now, have you seen bad
implementations of this?

305
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,720
Of course.

306
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,280
That's like asking, have I seen
a bad math lesson, right?

307
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,120
Yes, teachers are humans, especially
as we're trying to figure out

308
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,960
how to teach about race and racism.

309
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,960
Exactly. Teachers are human
and can make mistakes.

310
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,320
Frankly, I'm surprised
they don't make more.

311
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,200
They wake up insanely early and spend
all day getting low-key roasted

312
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:40,800
by teenagers for an amount of money
best described as completely harrowing.

313
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,280
The very fact any student in America
knows what a covalent bond is,

314
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,880
is a fucking miracle,

315
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,000
and every adult involved deserves
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

316
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,800
And the fact is, you can find examples
of clumsy, shitty lessons.

317
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,280
One school used a privilege bingo card,

318
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,240
which sure seems like a glib way
to handle a very serious subject.

319
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,920
Another classic lesson over
the years has been to teach

320
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,360
about prejudice metaphorically,
by dividing a classroom up by eye color,

321
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,400
with brown-eyed people, for instance,
being the lowest tier,

322
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,680
and them being treated terribly.

323
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,280
And if you do that
in a diverse classroom

324
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,960
and think that for even a second about
who is more likely to have brown eyes,

325
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,160
you can probably immediately see
just how badly that lesson could go.

326
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,440
That actually happened in at least
one school in the Chicago area,

327
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,920
and the reason I know that is that
this kid was in the class that day,

328
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,680
and she's one of our writers now.

329
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,480
Ali, what did you think of that lesson?

330
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,440
It was pretty fucked up

331
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,160
Yeah, I bet it was!

332
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,400
But the fact is, many educators
are working very hard

333
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,240
to find age-appropriate ways to talk
about race and racism in the classroom.

334
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,440
And if you do it right, you don't stop
at the civil rights movement,

335
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,040
you tell the story all the way
to the present day.

336
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,880
Which kids want and need.

337
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,400
They have questions about what
they can see with their own eyes,

338
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
and they deserve good answers.

339
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,040
And it is frankly far better for them
to have these discussions

340
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,720
in a supportive educational
environment,

341
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,520
rather than the potential alternative,

342
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,520
during a screaming match
at Thanksgiving.

343
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,040
But the panic over CRT threatens
to shut those conversations down.

344
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,520
And that is not all it is likely to do.

345
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,080
Because some pushing this panic
the hardest are actually using it

346
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,520
to advance a much bigger agenda that
they've wanted for a very long time,

347
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,400
and that is school choice, basically,
letting parents take tax dollars

348
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,240
afforded to the public schooling
of their kid and use them

349
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,080
at any school they like.

350
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,000
Here is Chris Rufo again,
laying out that exact strategy.

351
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,040
First, we have to just get it out
of schools.

352
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,920
We have to ban it and abolish it.

353
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,800
But in the long term, what we need to
do is give every parent in this country

354
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,280
a right to exit failing institutions.

355
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,520
No child should be trapped in a failing
public school that violates

356
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,880
his sense of conscience, that violates
the values of the parents.

357
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,800
Every parent
should take those education dollars

358
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,080
anywhere that they wish.

359
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,440
School choice will liberate people.
It will empower people

360
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,360
and it will actually depolarize some
of these national fights.

361
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,480
So you're doing all of this to tone
down partisan fights, are you, Chris?

362
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,320
Very cool of you. You've probably
noticed that general wave of calm,

363
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,480
chill vibes sweeping the nation lately.

364
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,640
If there is one word I would use
to describe every image coming out

365
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,360
of a school board meeting these days,
it is depolarized.

366
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,000
Look, it is not just Rufo.

367
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,480
Conservative organizations that
have long pushed for school choice,

368
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,440
like The Heritage Foundation
and FreedomWorks,

369
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,120
have poured money into this fight.

370
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,640
And of course, no school
choice push would be complete

371
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,720
without lifelong rich person and
occasional education secretary

372
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,920
Betsy DeVos,
who wrote an op-ed titled,

373
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,320
"Let's liberate kids from race
indoctrination with school choice".

374
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,400
And you should know,
this is just nothing new.

375
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,520
There is a long history
of responding to racial panic

376
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,760
with a push for school choice.

377
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,800
In fact, the roots of the school
choice movement trace back

378
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,240
to the Brown v. Board of Education
decision,

379
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,720
when Southern states adopted voucher
programs to facilitate the creation

380
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,320
of private schools called
segregation academies.

381
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,520
And some of those taking advantage
of school choice today

382
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,640
sure seem to be doing some heavy
indoctrination of their own.

383
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,840
Take Florida. It is one of the states
that allows public money

384
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,200
to go to voucher schools,
and a few years back,

385
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,160
an investigation into some of them
found commonly used textbooks

386
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,040
that downplayed the horrors
of slavery.

387
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,800
One of them is this one,
"America: Land I Love",

388
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,520
which has all the kind of bullshit
that you would expect,

389
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,080
that the Civil War was fought
for states' rights.

390
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,960
But it also states that,
during the antebellum period,

391
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,280
"the slave who knew Christ had
more freedom than a free person"

392
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,080
"who did not know the Savior."

393
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,960
Which is not just offensive,
it is profoundly stupid.

394
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,560
Any kid reading that absolute
trombone slide of a sentence

395
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,920
would instantly drop two full grades.

396
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,080
It sounds less like something
you'd find in a textbook

397
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,680
and more like something you'd find
crocheted on a throw pillow

398
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,560
in Paula Deen's living room.

399
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,160
So, if you want to talk about racial
indoctrination of school kids,

400
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,280
this might be a better place to start.

401
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,320
But the thing is, even
a manufactured panic is a panic.

402
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,960
Those parents at school board
meetings are genuinely angry.

403
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,600
And as any little league coach knows,

404
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,040
once you reach a critical mass
of angry white parents,

405
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,440
there will be consequences.

406
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,840
In Texas, this high school principal
was forced out of his job,

407
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,440
after being accused at a school
board meeting of promoting CRT

408
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,280
by someone who wasn't even
a parent at his school.

409
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,360
And in Tennessee, this current affairs
teacher was fired for not giving

410
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,560
"varying points of view" after he gave
students a Ta-Nehisi Coates article

411
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,840
and showed them Kyla Jenee
Lacey's poem "White Privilege".

412
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,480
And he actually had a pretty decent
response to that criticism.

413
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:13,520
I think, to me, the varying viewpoint
is Kyla Jenee Lacey,

414
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,280
and is Ta-Nehisi Coates.

415
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,520
Those are perspectives that
my students aren't exposed to

416
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,960
on a daily basis because we live

417
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,240
in that white dominant
evangelical environment.

418
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,200
Right. When you live in a mostly
white environment,

419
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,200
the voices of Black people can be
the varying point of view.

420
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,680
And not just on current events,

421
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,680
on lots of things that white people
might otherwise assume,

422
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,320
even trivial ones, like, "it's okay
to go out in a blizzard in shorts",

423
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,920
and, "if I argue with this cop,
I can probably get out of a ticket",

424
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,960
and, "time travel would be a fun
and stress-free activity".

425
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,480
"The 1930s!
I can't wait to look around!"

426
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,160
Unfortunately, though, those situations
are likely to become more common.

427
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,920
Since January of last year,
37 states have introduced bills

428
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,840
or taken other steps that would restrict
teaching critical race theory

429
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,840
or limit how teachers
can discuss racism.

430
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,400
And the justification for these has
often been more than a little flimsy.

431
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,560
Here is one Tennessee lawmaker
explaining

432
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,800
why he was pushing for his state's bill.

433
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,600
Listen to the following quotes
from an email forwarded to me

434
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,120
concerning a seven-year-old girl
in Williamson County.

435
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,880
The little girl told her mother:
"I'm ashamed that I'm white."

436
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,560
The daughter then asked her mother,

437
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,560
"Is there something wrong with me?
Why am I hated so much?"

438
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,320
Okay, I hear that, I really do.

439
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,400
The thing to do in that situation isn't
to pass a law limiting the discussion

440
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,920
of race in the classroom. It's to ask
literally one follow-up question.

441
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,240
Like, "What was happening to make
you think the other kids hate you?"

442
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,040
Or, "Did any adults step in
when you felt this way?"

443
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,800
Or, "Do you even exist?"

444
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,800
Because you should know,
when reporters looked into this,

445
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,120
they found no parent had come forward
to that school's principal, teachers,

446
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,560
or district officials
with that complaint,

447
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,400
and administrators there weren't able
to pinpoint any student

448
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,040
who might be upset or lessons
that could have been upsetting.

449
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,720
And if that is how
we are arguing things now,

450
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,000
I should probably mention that, I, too,
just so happen to have an email forward

451
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,480
from a different little white girl,

452
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,120
way cuter than the first one,
by the way,

453
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,840
who said that that first girl's story
is complete bullshit.

454
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,320
And the thing is, by Tennessee law, it
seems, I simply have to believe her.

455
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,320
But that lawmaker actually illustrates
the problems facing legislators

456
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,280
currently trying to outlaw something
that they cannot define.

457
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,840
Because what are you then
going to do?

458
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,680
Pass a law saying kids
can't feel bad?

459
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,160
Well, it turns out, yes. Because that
is exactly what Tennessee did.

460
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,600
They passed a law prohibiting
any teaching

461
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,920
that would cause "discomfort,
guilt, anguish,"

462
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,560
"or distress solely because
of the individual's race or sex".

463
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,320
Which is very broad.

464
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,080
You're not going to believe this,
but I just received another email

465
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,640
this second from a third Tennessee
white girl who says:

466
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,480
"What fucking idiots
are writing these laws"

467
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,880
"and how many fictitious children are
they going to make up to justify them?"

468
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,680
"PS: I honestly preferred
the new Zazu."

469
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:18,280
And wow! What a nice thing to say
from a definitely real child!

470
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,920
And look, the thing is, we have
talked before on this show

471
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,920
about the multiple problems
with teaching kids

472
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,960
a sanitized version of U.S. history,

473
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,240
and how, as far back as a century ago,

474
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,040
groups like the United Daughters
of the Confederacy were reshaping

475
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,280
textbooks to downplay its horrors.

476
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,240
And it seems here we go again,
I guess.

477
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,400
Because lawmakers are trying
to micromanage school curriculums,

478
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,720
sometimes pretty ineptly.

479
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,840
A bill proposed in Virginia contains
a section listing

480
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,760
some of the founding documents
that it's okay to teach,

481
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,360
a list that includes the Declaration
of Independence, the Constitution,

482
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,320
and the first debate between Abraham
Lincoln and Frederick Douglass,

483
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,120
which, I hope you know,
is not a thing that happened.

484
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,880
The Lincoln-Douglas debates were,
of course,

485
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,640
between Senator Stephen Douglas
and his opponent,

486
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,440
a 2020 Lincoln Navigator.
So, read your history, everyone.

487
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,200
Facts matter here.

488
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,040
But maybe the most insulting distortion
of history is in the quote

489
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,320
that every single anti-CRT activist
seems to love to invoke.

490
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,120
You think about what MLK stood for,

491
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,520
he said he didn't want people
judged on the color of their skin,

492
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,680
but on the content of their character.

493
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,240
I believe it was Martin Luther King
that said,

494
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,360
when he was talking about
his children that...

495
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,240
He didn't want his children
to be judged...

496
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,080
On the color of their skin.

497
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,040
But by the content of their character.

498
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,320
Content of their character,
not by the color of their skin.

499
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,720
Content of our character,
not the color of our skin.

500
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,920
And the immortal words of Dr. Martin
Luther King ring in our ears...

501
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,960
We must judge others not
by the color of their skin,

502
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,680
but by the content
of their character.

503
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,240
The left wants us to constantly focus
on skin color. It's destructive.

504
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,440
Martin Luther King, Jr. is rolling over
in his grave.

505
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,320
Yeah, you know what,
I bet he is, actually.

506
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,480
In fact, I'm pretty sure every time
someone uses his words that way,

507
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,600
Dr. King's illustrious remains
spin fast enough to power

508
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,200
the eastern fucking seaboard.

509
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,840
Here is the thing, though, that dream
speech was clearly

510
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:19,080
an aspirational goal, not a description
of things as they stood.

511
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,640
And in fact, King himself later
put a pretty major asterisk on it.

512
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,880
I must confess that that dream
that I had that day

513
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,160
has at many points turned
into a nightmare.

514
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:36,160
And I've come to see that we have
many more difficult days ahead,

515
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,000
and some of the old optimism
was a little superficial,

516
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,400
and now it must be tempered
with a solid realism.

517
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,200
Yeah, exactly. And in a book
published that same year,

518
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,680
he wrote that, while "the majority of
white Americans consider themselves"

519
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,080
"sincerely committed to justice
for the Negro,"

520
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,120
"and they believe that American society
is essentially hospitable to fair play"

521
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,840
"and to steady growth toward
a middle-class utopia"

522
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,960
"embodying racial harmony".

523
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,040
"Unfortunately, this is a fantasy
of self-deception"

524
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,680
"and comfortable vanity."

525
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,960
So, while it is clearly very appealing
to create a version of history

526
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,800
where MLK was a kind figure
who existed solely to help white people

527
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,560
win arguments, the truth is,

528
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,560
he later reflected on his own message
and challenged white people

529
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,280
to look more deeply at themselves.

530
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,760
And that is something that kids should
absolutely be learning about in school.

531
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,960
But the problem is,
they won't if these laws continue.

532
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,240
A white parent could plausibly claim
that reading MLK's writing

533
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,080
made their child feel discomfort
on the basis of their race.

534
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,720
And some of these laws seem designed
to bend schools' curriculums

535
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,240
to the sensibilities of the most
conservative, alarmed parents.

536
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,200
In Florida, Ron DeSantis is pushing
a Stop Woke Act,

537
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,360
that was him unveiling it just
a minute ago, with Chris Rufo

538
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,200
right behind him.

539
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,920
And that would give parents private
right of action to sue

540
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,160
if they think their kids
are being taught CRT.

541
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,440
And all of these laws are already
having chilling effects.

542
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,800
Book bans are on the rise
around the country,

543
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,600
and one Oklahoma school district
has even told teachers

544
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,480
simply to avoid using terms like
"diversity" and "white privilege".

545
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,480
You can ban all the books you want.

546
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,000
You can try and legislate it away,

547
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,120
but as any Black woman
on "The Bachelor" can tell you,

548
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,080
talking about race is unavoidable.

549
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,440
And it is not just unavoidable,
it's essential,

550
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,920
especially in the places where people
are most panicked about CRT.

551
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,120
And this actually brings us all the way
back to where this story began,

552
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,880
in Loudoun County, Virginia,

553
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,520
where that school board meeting
got so very far out of hand.

554
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Here is one of the leaders
of the anti-CRT push there,

555
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,480
explaining just why she is so fiercely
opposed to it being taught.

556
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,840
In Loudoun County, this is the
wealthiest county in the country.

557
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,000
There's not a lot of racism.

558
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,600
There are silly people that say
stupid things,

559
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:07,480
but if you talk about it less, you're
going to notice that division less.

560
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,080
I don't look at the person based
on their skin color,

561
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,440
I look at them based on their character.

562
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,960
Okay, so, there's a lot of obvious
red flags there,

563
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,920
from confidently asserting "there's not
a lot of racism here"

564
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,800
to the "I don't see skin color,"

565
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,520
to the "you won't notice division so
much if you just don't talk about it".

566
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,960
If the problem with racism
in America was only

567
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,000
"it's bumming Patti Menders out",

568
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,120
then yeah, shutting up would
probably solve the whole issue.

569
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,920
But guess how long it takes for that
conversation to take a real turn.

570
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,720
I think there are probably plenty
of people that would agree

571
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,000
with exactly that.

572
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,640
But just to be fair on
the other side, there are people,

573
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,040
especially young Black men,
for example, who would say,

574
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,960
"I would love to not be judged
on the color of my skin".

575
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,320
Do you think it's more on the color
of their skin or their actions?

576
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:57,080
How they're dressed, how they
perceive, how they respect others?

577
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,920
If you have a kid that's pulled over
by a cop,

578
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,960
does it really matter
what color they are,

579
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,800
or is it the respect that they give
to that police officer?

580
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,920
When you respond to someone
mentioning young Black men would like

581
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,720
to be treated better by automatically
envisioning them dressed terribly

582
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,880
and acting disrespectfully while
being arrested by the police,

583
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,040
you are telling on yourself, Patti.

584
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,000
You are snitching on your very soul.

585
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,160
And as for her claim there that there
is "not a lot of racism"

586
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,680
in Loudoun County, you probably
already assumed that that was bullshit,

587
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,840
but you should know, an assessment
of public schools there found

588
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,960
that it was shocking the extent to which
students report the use of the N-word.

589
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,040
As a society, we've now agreed white
people should not be using

590
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,240
the N-word a shocking
number of times,

591
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,920
unless, that is, they have a lucrative
podcast deal with Spotify.

592
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,280
But that is absolutely it.

593
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,960
And all of this brings us
to the main point here,

594
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:57,040
that for all the laws being passed
to prevent discomfort or anguish

595
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,160
on account of an individual's race,

596
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,800
whose discomfort, exactly,
are we prioritizing here?

597
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,680
Because kids of color can tell you

598
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,280
they don't get a choice to not talk
about race

599
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,800
and have it go away, like this graduate
of Loudoun County schools.

600
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,120
I do understand that many parents don't
want their children learning about race

601
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,360
at such a young age, but I beg to differ
in that sense.

602
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,000
We learn about race every day
when we're the only colored kid

603
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,440
in our classrooms, or when
we're learning about slavery

604
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,840
and all the heads turn to us.

605
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,080
So, one way or another,

606
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,560
one group of students will learn
about race before another.

607
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,800
We believe that it would be equitable
if all students learned about race

608
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,920
in the same context, so we can work
together on it to improve our future.

609
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,680
Yeah. Children of color learn about
race from a very young age.

610
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,600
From realizing you celebrate different
holidays or get different safety talks,

611
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,680
or the first time you go
to a white friend's house

612
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,280
and you're served a casserole.

613
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,400
You realize very quickly in that moment,
we are different people

614
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,200
with different cultures.

615
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,400
So, look, by this point,
it should be pretty clear,

616
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,360
the debate around critical race theory
is both very loud and very, very dumb.

617
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,320
But unfortunately,
it is important to engage with it.

618
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,440
Because if we don't,

619
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,000
the endpoint that we are heading toward
is that honest discussions of race

620
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,840
will be shut out of public schools,

621
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,840
even as some parents fuck off
to voucher academies

622
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,640
where their kids can learn a version
of history

623
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,720
that's basically antebellum fan fiction.

624
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,920
And I am not saying that discussions
on race will always be comfortable

625
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,520
for everyone in a classroom,

626
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:27,320
but when was learning and growing
as a person ever really comfortable?

627
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,760
The thing to do here isn't to run
from those discussions

628
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,200
or pass laws banning them.

629
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,280
It is to learn how to have
them better.

630
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,760
Because for generation after generation,
we've told school kids fairy tales

631
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,360
about race in this country.

632
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,000
And maybe it's time
we stop doing that.

633
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,480
Because all it's done so far is get us
to the point that we're at right now,

634
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,640
with full-grown adults insisting
America can't be racist

635
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,320
because we elected Obama twice,

636
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,240
that racism will go away
if we just don't mention it,

637
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,680
and that Martin Luther King's
"I Have a Dream" speech

638
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,120
wasn't an aspiration
we have yet to fulfill,

639
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,240
but some kind of magic spell that
ended prejudice then and there.

640
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,560
That is our show, thank
you so much for watching,

641
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,360
we'll see you next week, goodnight.

642
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,040
John, I've got more stories.

643
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,600
In third grade, we did
an Oregon Trail unit

644
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,720
and my teacher put me and the other
Black kid in the class together

645
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,680
and said we were a family
of freed slaves

646
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,800
heading west to make our fortune.

647
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,000
Like, what am I supposed
to do with that?

648
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,480
In sixth grade, I told my teacher

649
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,800
that reading "Roll of Thunder, Hear
My Cry" made me uncomfortable,

650
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,600
and she told me,
"It all works out in the end".

651
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,280
In the end, one of the characters
almost gets lynched.

652
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,720
How is "almost gets lynched"
a happy ending?

653
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,920
For Ellis Island Day, I said,
"My family didn't emigrate,"

654
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,560
"and we don't know
where in Africa we're from."

655
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,480
And my teacher said, "Well, guess."
And I was like, "Bitch, you guess."

656
