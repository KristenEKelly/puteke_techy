00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,719
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,320
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight"!
I'm John Oliver.

3
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:36,359
Thank you so much for joining us.
It has been a busy week.

4
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:38,920
And a huge one for the president,

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,280
with Congress passing
the Inflation Reduction Act,

6
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:43,439
which includes
the single largest investment

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,640
in combating climate change
in U.S. history.

8
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,920
In any other week,

9
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,560
that would have completely
dominated the headlines.

10
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,439
But not this one!

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,159
Because as I'm sure
you know by now, on Monday,

12
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,039
the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago
and seized documents,

13
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:01,359
something that Trump reacted
to with characteristic restraint.

14
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,159
Mr. Trump said Mar-a-Lago
was "under siege, raided,

15
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:09,239
and occupied
by a large group of FBI agents",

16
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,079
adding,
"They even broke into my safe!"

17
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,239
No, not your safe!

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,000
Amazingly, it turns out, the FBI
even checks your locked safes

19
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,480
when they go through your home
with a search warrant.

20
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,599
The only way around that is if your
safe says "no FBI allowed!" on it.

21
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,920
Then, legally,
they can't look in there.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,439
The search apparently stems from
classified and sensitive documents

23
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,680
that Trump took from the White House
as he left office,

24
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,519
with some reportedly containing
information related to nuclear weapons.

25
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:39,599
And I am not going to speculate
or jump to conclusions here,

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,359
because there is still so much
that we don't know.

27
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:45,040
But many seemed more than happy
to do that this week,

28
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,400
with multiple Republicans
likening the FBI to the Gestapo,

29
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,840
Fox News
trawling through the Facebook feed

30
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,359
of the judge
who approved the warrant

31
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,640
and showing a meme of his face
on Jeffrey Epstein's body,

32
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:59,000
and others preemptively minimizing
what Trump may have done.

33
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,120
There are a number of things

34
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,879
that are classified that fall under
the umbrella of nuclear weapons,

35
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,960
but that are not necessarily
things that are truly classified.

36
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,680
Many of them you can find
on your own phone.

37
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,919
I don't know exactly
what's going on with that guy,

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,319
but the way he's clearing his throat
lets me know

39
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,840
that his body is reacting to the
nonsense that he's spewing there.

40
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,199
Because while it's true that we do
absolutely over classify documents,

41
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,520
and it's also true that the internet
holds a vast array of knowledge

42
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,280
that it probably shouldn't,
like info on nuclear weapons

43
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,560
and an entire website
devoted to celebrities' feet,

44
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,560
I'm waiting, by the way.

45
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,199
I would not be so quick
to assume

46
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,120
the most cautious AG
the U.S. has had for a while

47
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,199
took the unprecedented step of sending
the FBI to an ex-president's house

48
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,039
if he didn't think
it was absolutely necessary.

49
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,960
There is clearly gonna be a lot more
to say about this as things develop,

50
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:57,000
but we're going to dive straight
in with our main story this week,

51
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,719
which concerns Afghanistan.

52
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,520
A country that's blessed the world
with innumerable treasures,

53
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,960
from embroidery to traditional
Pashto and Persian poetry

54
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,479
to the Afghan hound, undoubtedly,
the Real Housewife of show dogs.

55
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,719
She's a messy bitch
and she lives for drama.

56
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,560
This week marked 1-year anniversary
of our withdrawal from Afghanistan,

57
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,479
which you may remember
was complete mayhem.

58
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,919
They were scenes marked
by chaos and desperation.

59
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:29,319
Hundreds of Afghan citizens running
alongside a departing U.S. C-17.

60
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,520
Nearly a year after the U.S withdrawal,
the indelible images remain.

61
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,560
A U.S. Marine lifting a baby

62
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,439
over a barbed-wire-topped wall
at Kabul's airport.

63
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,680
And this photo, taken by technical
sergeant Justin Triola.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,039
How many people do you think
are on your jet?

65
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,639
800 people on your jet?

66
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,879
Holy cow!

67
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:56,599
Yup! I think everyone knew the U.S.
occupation was going to end badly,

68
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,479
but it's still shocking
just how bad it was.

69
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,439
In terms of things not going
the way that you thought,

70
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,080
our exit was the foreign policy
equivalent of putting a cake in the oven

71
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,000
and then, 40 minutes later,
taking out a live rat dressed as Hitler.

72
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,039
It's not just a fuck-up,

73
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,879
it's a mind-blowing fuck-up
that'll take years to fully comprehend.

74
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,639
Everything happened so fast, apparently
"even the Taliban was surprised"

75
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,959
at how quickly
the Afghan government fell.

76
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,560
And a pretty decent way of knowing
if the U.S. did a good job at something

77
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,879
is by asking the question,

78
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,839
"Was whatever we did
a fun surprise for the Taliban?"

79
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:33,120
Within a matter of days,
the Afghan government fell

80
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,199
and the Taliban took over,
and many top U.S. military officials

81
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:40,439
have struggled since then to put into
words how badly they miscalculated,

82
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,959
with General Mark Milley
putting it like this.

83
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,399
All the intel assessments,
all of us, got that wrong.

84
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,319
There's no question about it.
That was a swing and a miss

85
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:51,879
on the intel assessment
of 11 days in August.

86
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,160
There's nobody that called that.

87
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,800
Yeah, that's about right.
"Swing and a miss"

88
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,839
describes roughly 40% of the U.S.
government's history.

89
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,319
The breakdown of "stuff we've done"
goes something like this:

90
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:04,560
40% "swing and a miss",
20% "beefed it",

91
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,600
15% "whoops",
15% "whoops, parentheses, murders",

92
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,079
and 10% "delivered most,
but not all, of the mail."

93
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:17,199
There is a lot to criticize
about the way we left Afghanistan,

94
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,079
including the fact that, while we
managed to get roughly 80,000 Afghans,

95
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,279
many of whom had worked with the U.S.,
to America since the withdrawal,

96
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,959
the number who remain in danger

97
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,319
because of the association
with the U.S mission

98
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,720
can be counted
in the hundreds of thousands.

99
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,199
So, criticism of what happened
is completely justified,

100
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,920
though maybe not from the guy
whose administration

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,879
signed the deal
to leave in the first place.

102
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,279
Bagram is this great air base
that was built many years ago,

103
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,240
and it cost them
billions and billions.

104
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,240
And we left in one night, everybody
was gone, they left the lights on.

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,639
Think of it, the lights were all
left on, the dogs were left behind,

106
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,160
by the way, for those people
that like dogs.

107
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,480
But we left, and they don't
like dogs, you know that?

108
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,639
They don't like dogs.
They don't like 'em at all.

109
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,040
What?

110
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,279
It has been a while since we've heard
Trump's voice on this show,

111
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,600
and I somehow forgot
just how bizarrely incoherent he is.

112
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:12,319
It's truly extraordinary
to see his brain

113
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,000
function like a crow spotting
a crumpled-up can.

114
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,319
'Cause he's flying, he's flying,
he's flying, and thenÂ…

115
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,000
"Whoa nelly, hold on,
is that what I think it is?

116
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,120
Shiny garbage? Nosedive!"

117
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,079
Also comments about people not liking
dogs are a little odd coming from a man

118
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,120
who, every time he holds one,
seems to make the dog want to die.

119
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,040
But we're not going to talk about the
withdrawal from Afghanistan tonight.

120
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,120
Instead, we're going to focus
on everything that's happened since.

121
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,759
While Afghanistan has faded as a topic
of discussion in this country,

122
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,120
it really shouldn't,
'cause it's in dire crisis right now.

123
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,680
And I will admit, this is a grim topic.
But it's also an important one.

124
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,920
Because things are going worse
in Afghanistan than you may know,

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,680
for reasons that have even more to do
with our decisions

126
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,040
than you might think.

127
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,519
So tonight,
let's check in on Afghanistan.

128
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,720
And let's start with the fact
that, as I mentioned earlier,

129
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,680
the Taliban is now in charge.

130
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,920
And in the early days
of their takeover,

131
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,360
they tried to convey a slightly
softer image to journalists,

132
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,519
through carefree photo ops
like this one,

133
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,879
where Taliban members
visited a fairground in Kabul,

134
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,560
or this one,
where they took a trip to the zoo,

135
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,079
and really spelled out the message
that they wanted the world to hear.

136
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,800
We want to show everyone
that under Islamic rule and security,

137
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,480
everything is enjoyable,

138
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,279
and everyone can live in their
own country the way they want.

139
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,319
Yeah, 'cause that's what you
associate the Taliban with:

140
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,240
freedom for everyone
to live their best life.

141
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,079
Also, for what it's worth,

142
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,399
I don't think losing the right
to drive bumper cars or go to the zoo

143
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,240
was at the top of anyone's list of
concerns when the Taliban took over.

144
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,279
It's akin to the Pope saying,
"Don't worry, everyone:

145
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,160
Catholics are still allowed
to use pogo sticks!"

146
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,199
Okay, great, but to be honest,
that's not the main issue

147
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,800
people have with the Catholic Church
right now.

148
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,920
And while the Taliban
is not actually a monolith,

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,879
different regional leaders rule
with different degrees of severity,

150
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:07,759
I do still feel comfortable saying
everything's very much not enjoyable

151
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:10,000
for everyone in Afghanistan
right now.

152
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,279
For starters, there've been brutal
reprisals against U.S. allies

153
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,240
and former Afghan
government employees,

154
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:18,319
nearly 500 of whom were killed
or forcibly disappeared

155
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,959
during the Taliban's first six months
in power,

156
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,639
and on a much bigger level,

157
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,319
the Taliban's taken an absolute
sledgehammer to women's rights.

158
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,040
For all the many legitimate
criticisms of America's occupation,

159
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,639
women did make huge gains there:

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
in 2001, there were few,
if any, girls in school,

161
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,519
and by 2020, girls made up
roughly 40% of all students.

162
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,759
That same year,
"Afghanistan's parliament

163
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,480
had a higher percentage of women
than the U.S. Congress did."

164
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,240
But now they've essentially
gone back to zero.

165
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,639
But much more than that,

166
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,519
Taliban decrees have tried to control
nearly every aspect of women's lives,

167
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,320
ordering that they shouldn't leave
their homes unless necessary,

168
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:59,879
and that only women
who can't be replaced by men

169
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,720
will be allowed to keep working.

170
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:05,559
In fact, one of the only areas
women can work is in healthcare,

171
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:06,960
because there are some situations

172
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:09,960
where men aren't allowed
to treat women as patients.

173
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:12,960
This midwife, for example,
is still working in a hospital.

174
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:16,200
But she is furious about what
she sees happening to her country.

175
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,600
The Taliban cannot ban me
from working in the hospital,

176
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,919
because they know
that it is needed.

177
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,159
I humbly request the Taliban,

178
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,960
do not meddle in women's rights
to education and employment.

179
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,200
Otherwise, they are amputating
one arm from the body of society.

180
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:41,200
Our societies
are made of two pillars,

181
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:44,679
the pillar of men
and another pillar of women.

182
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:47,360
How can you run your life
one-sided?

183
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,120
Of course. You can't run a society
on a pillar of just men.

184
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,840
I mean, we've tried,
for thousands of years, we have tried.

185
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,440
But look where it's got us:

186
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,080
we have a global pandemic,
the planet is on fire,

187
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,559
"The Baby-Sitters Club" is canceled
despite unparalleled critical success,

188
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:07,279
and the world's richest man
is a ventriloquist dummy from hell.

189
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,039
Let's maybe lean on that one pillar
a little bit less.

190
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,720
And things are getting worse.
Because in March,

191
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:16,879
the Taliban went back on a promise
that they made when they took over,

192
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,919
and announced that girls
would be prevented

193
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,559
from receiving a secondary school
education in most of the country.

194
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,320
Now, that decision "drew widespread
condemnation in Afghanistan,

195
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,799
including from many
Taliban members".

196
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,639
But the leadership pushed back,
claiming that it's just temporary,

197
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,879
and arguing, among other things,
that they simply

198
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,840
"needed more time to decide on
a school uniform for teenage girls."

199
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,960
Which is clearly total bullshit.

200
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,639
Besides, for an organization
so concerned with virtue and purity,

201
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,840
taking months to brainstorm
a schoolgirl uniform you like

202
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:49,679
is objectively the single
perviest thing you can do.

203
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,159
Women in particular have lost
a great deal in the last year.

204
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,639
But on top of that,

205
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,639
the country is facing a cascading
series of humanitarian crises.

206
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,360
The UN has estimated that
"as much as 97% of the population

207
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,639
is at risk of sinking
below the poverty line."

208
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,320
And part of that is due
to a series of natural disasters,

209
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:13,000
from an ongoing severe drought
that's hit around 80% of the country,

210
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,919
devastating food production,

211
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,559
to a massive earthquake in June,
and flooding just this month.

212
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,080
But that's been exacerbated
by the fact that this is all falling

213
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,480
on a new Taliban government that
is in no way equipped to take it on.

214
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,399
The Taliban now need to shift
from being a jihadist insurgency

215
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,879
to a ruling group.

216
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,320
20 years, you've built an organization
that was designed to fight,

217
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,679
and you motivated people
to engage in suicide bombings.

218
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,799
They don't turn into people who
are government officials overnight.

219
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,639
Yeah, of course not.

220
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:51,399
A militant insurgency group
is pretty low on the list of people

221
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,720
that you want leading a government,
right around the Hell's Angels,

222
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:57,080
the Manson family,
and Ron DeSantis.

223
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,639
And to be a million percent clear,
I am not suggesting

224
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,360
that the U.S. occupation
was a perfect, magic wonderland.

225
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,120
It was awful in its own ways,

226
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,440
not least, having to live under the
specter of hellfire being rained down

227
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,399
from flying unmanned
death machines every day.

228
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,679
Our continued presence there
was untenable.

229
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:20,200
But the exact circumstances
of our departure

230
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:23,799
have, to a significant degree,
made things substantially worse.

231
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,639
We've made a series of decisions,
some of them understandable,

232
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,360
that have had huge ramifications
for the Afghan people.

233
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,159
And let's start with the Taliban
government itself.

234
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,960
When it took over, many of its members
were already sanctioned by the U.S.,

235
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,039
because we list the Taliban as a
Specially Designated Terrorist Group.

236
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,559
So, suddenly,
those pre-existing sanctions

237
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,080
applied to at least part
of the Taliban government.

238
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,960
Take Sirajuddin Haqqani.

239
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:51,480
The State Department
currently has a $10 million reward

240
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,559
out for information
leading to his arrest.

241
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,120
But you should know, he's the current
acting interior minister there.

242
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,720
So, guess what, State Department?
I found him!

243
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,120
Can you mail me my $10 million,
now, please?

244
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:06,440
Don't worry,
I spend my money very wisely.

245
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:10,639
So, individuals in the Taliban
government are sanctioned,

246
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,759
which effectively
means the whole government is,

247
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,879
making it nearly impossible for banks,
businesses, charities to operate there.

248
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,679
Which is a massive problem.

249
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:23,120
Especially because 75% of the former
Afghan government's budget

250
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,279
came from foreign aid
and grants.

251
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,960
75%!

252
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,120
That was the money
that, among other things,

253
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,600
paid the salaries
for vital government services,

254
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,879
like teachers
and public sector employees.

255
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,320
And all that aid
disappeared almost immediately.

256
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:40,559
As one expert has said,
"No country in the world

257
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,519
could withstand a sharp cutoff
of that aid".

258
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,320
And it's affected everything.
In healthcare, for instance,

259
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,120
the World Bank and other organizations
immediately froze $600 million in aid.

260
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,919
Which left doctors
in a very difficult position.

261
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,799
This state hospital
in the heart of Kabul

262
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,960
has not received funding
since the Taliban takeover.

263
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,799
We don't have
any medicine here.

264
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,000
We had antibiotics,
painkillers, and vitamins here,

265
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,159
but it's empty now.

266
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,320
What's your budget now
in total for the department?

267
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,559
For the total department,
we didn't have,

268
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:18,080
just only for our salary
we have budget,

269
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,879
but for other item,
we didn't have any budget.

270
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,279
- You mean your budget is zero?
- The budget is zero, yeah.

271
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:27,159
Yeah. Zero.

272
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,080
It is hard to imagine how a hospital
can function with a budget of zero,

273
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,559
unless every exam room is just
a paper bag and a sign that says,

274
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,720
"Yell what hurts into this bag.
Then leave."

275
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,720
And it gets even worse,

276
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,960
because U.S. also froze Afghanistan's
central bank assets held in America,

277
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:47,440
amounting to around "$7 billion."

278
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,559
That is money typically used to do
things like keep the currency stable,

279
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,759
finance imports, and provide
money to the banking system.

280
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,279
The U.S. froze these assets to prevent
the Taliban from accessing them,

281
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,360
but that also kneecapped
the country's entire banking system,

282
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,679
especially as Afghanistan doesn't have
the ability to print its own currency.

283
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,000
All of this led
to a literal cash shortage,

284
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,440
where even Afghans who do have
money in the bank can't access it.

285
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:15,799
So, there've been massive lines
and waits just to get money out.

286
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:20,000
At some banks, withdrawing cash has
reportedly taken three days or more.

287
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,559
And that has brought the country
to an unusual state of affairs.

288
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,200
This is a unique
humanitarian crisis.

289
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,840
This is a situation
where food is technically available,

290
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:31,840
but there isn't enough liquidity
in the economy

291
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,679
and enough availability
of paper currency to purchase food.

292
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,840
Food which is available.

293
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,159
Right, and that is awful.
Food, but no money to buy it with.

294
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,879
It's like a lyric
from Alanis Morissette's "Ironic"

295
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,440
in that it's fundamentally
not ironic at all,

296
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,320
and I'm sure Dave Coulier
is still somehow to blame.

297
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,159
Things are very grim in Afghanistan.
Its population is young.

298
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,240
Nearly half
are under the age of 15,

299
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,960
and UNICEF has warned that over a
million severely malnourished children

300
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:05,159
will be at risk of death without
emergency treatment this year.

301
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,240
And because many Afghans have
nowhere to turn for food or for money,

302
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,360
families have been forced
to make some harrowing choices.

303
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:17,559
40-year-old Ghulam Hazrat
sold his kidney for around $2,300.

304
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:22,879
My conscience
didn't allow me to go and beg.

305
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,440
I said, "Let's trust God",
and decided to sell my kidney

306
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,200
so that I could feed my daughters
for some time.

307
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,200
It's true.
He sold his kidney to feed his kids,

308
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:39,559
a desperate decision
that you can make precisely once.

309
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,200
That's actually an increasingly
common decision in Afghanistan.

310
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,559
And it's not just that.

311
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,960
Families are also selling
some of their children,

312
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,879
so that they can feed the others.

313
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,279
Which is unimaginably heartbreaking

314
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,679
So, clearly, the people of Afghanistan
are in dire need of help.

315
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,080
And the current president has,
at times,

316
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:00,840
been alarmingly blithe
about the situation there.

317
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,680
Do I feel badly
what's happening to,

318
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,319
as a consequence
of the incompetence of the Taliban?

319
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,039
Yes, I do.

320
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,559
But I feel badly also about the fistulas
that are taking place in eastern Congo.

321
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,559
I feel badly about a whole range
of things around the world,

322
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,279
that we can't solve every problem.

323
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,640
First, I hate to be
a Marian the Librarian,

324
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,240
but you don't "feel badly",
you feel bad.

325
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,400
Feel is a linking verb,
and you're modifying it incorrectly.

326
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
Marian out.

327
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:38,720
And it's pretty disheartening to see

328
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,759
our official foreign policy boil down
to, "Sorry champ, can't win 'em all!"

329
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:45,720
Especially when the U.S.
is so directly responsible

330
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,920
for so many problems
in Afghanistan.

331
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,519
And in eastern Congo, by the way,
but that is a different story.

332
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,720
The Biden administration
will point out

333
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:56,240
that it's begun issuing
sanctions exemptions

334
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:58,920
to allow the free flow
of some humanitarian aid.

335
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,200
And it's sent hundreds of millions
in relief to Afghanistan,

336
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:05,200
more than any other country,
which is absolutely true.

337
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,319
It's also true that they have done
that in the face of stiff opposition

338
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,279
from some on the right,
who argue in pretty strong terms

339
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:14,759
against any kind of assistance,
and for one particular reason.

340
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:17,279
Obviously, there's humanitarian
suffering all over this planet, right?

341
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,720
I'm not in favor of giving money

342
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,960
that I'm pretty confident will end up
in the hands of the Taliban.

343
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,680
We should not give them
one red cent

344
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:27,680
until such time
as we can demonstrate

345
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:29,720
that they have actually done
what they said they would do,

346
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:32,240
which is to separate themselves
from terror.

347
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:37,960
Mike Pompeo and deepfake
Blake Shelton are clearly assholes.

348
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,559
Although I will say,
for even non-assholes,

349
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,799
it is natural to be concerned
about the prospect of U.S. aid money

350
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,160
going to the Taliban.

351
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,559
But a couple of things
you should know.

352
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,759
For years now, charities
have been able to find ways to work

353
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,720
with, through, or around the Taliban,
to help ordinary Afghan citizens.

354
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,400
They had to do that,
because even when the U.S. was there,

355
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,200
the Taliban effectively still
controlled large parts of the country.

356
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:03,319
And for people
at some of those groups,

357
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,920
like the Afghanistan director at the
International Rescue Committee,

358
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,200
the fact that they are financially
constrained from helping people now

359
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,720
is pretty frustrating.

360
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,359
I think a lot of people will say, "We
don't want to see aid go to Afghanistan

361
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,160
because we don't want to give money
to the Taliban.

362
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,720
That's an extremist group."

363
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,559
You want to make 38 million people
suffer because of a few thousand?

364
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,960
That math doesn't work for me.

365
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:32,599
Right. That math
doesn't work for me either.

366
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,279
And that is saying something,
because look at me.

367
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,680
I look like math in human form.

368
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,519
I look like a PokÃ©mon whose final
evolution is a graphing calculator.

369
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:45,839
I look like an algebra textbook left me
on the doorstep of an orphanage.

370
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,319
I look like what Matt Damon's
character in "Good Will Hunting"

371
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,839
should have looked like.

372
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:55,039
So, when I say that math doesn't work,
you better fucking believe me.

373
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:57,680
So, there is a strong case
to be made

374
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:00,880
for finding ways to get
humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.

375
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,559
But that is not all it needs.

376
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,920
In the long term,

377
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,920
no amount of emergency
relief can stand in for healthcare,

378
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,759
an education system,
or a functioning economy.

379
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:14,279
As one report said, "humanitarian
efforts are bandages, not cures".

380
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:16,680
You can't just keep
applying them forever.

381
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:19,960
And right now, there are some
worrying signs of donor fatigue,

382
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:22,359
with contributions from the
international community drying up,

383
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,200
even as nearly 20 million people,
almost half Afghanistan's population,

384
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,000
are experiencing high
and critical levels of food insecurity.

385
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,000
A more sustainable way to help them
is through development aid,

386
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:37,039
building long-term solutions,

387
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:39,200
like investing in healthcare
and education salaries,

388
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,960
or helping build
infrastructure through

389
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,319
"investments in irrigation
and water management"

390
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,160
in areas affected by the drought.

391
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,920
But the tricky thing with that is,

392
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,720
that really does require some form
of engagement with the Taliban.

393
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,839
There are mechanisms
to try and ensure

394
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,960
that they don't end up
benefiting financially,

395
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,519
but admittedly,
none of them are perfect.

396
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,079
And the idea of the Taliban
getting one red cent

397
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,799
is obviously hard to swallow.

398
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:05,319
Especially because,
despite the Taliban's new

399
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,079
outward-facing
"live, laugh, love" vibe,

400
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,559
they've continued to remind us
how terrible they are,

401
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,759
not only with their heinous treatment
of women,

402
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,279
but also with the recent confirmation

403
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,920
that they were harboring
the leader of Al Qaeda in a safe house.

404
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,640
But withholding all forms of aid until
the Taliban either give in or collapse

405
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,960
just is not a viable strategy.

406
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:29,160
Because, for one thing, who knows
how long that will take, if ever?

407
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,400
And for another, while you're waiting,
potentially millions will starve.

408
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,359
Listen to that midwife from earlier,
who is no fan of the Taliban,

409
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,079
explain what she thinks
of that logic.

410
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,880
Your sanctions on the Taliban

411
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,599
will kill us faster than the violation
of our rights by the Taliban.

412
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,200
A girl dies from hunger
and a mother either sells her daughter

413
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,960
because of hunger
or from pressure to marry her by force.

414
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,279
The issue of their education
and literacy

415
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,119
is meaningless
when you're dying from hunger.

416
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:08,279
Yeah, she's right.
There's no two ways around it.

417
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:11,440
This is a crisis
at the most fundamental level.

418
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:14,839
And thankfully, there've been
small steps in the right direction.

419
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,599
The U.S. is working on a proposal

420
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,640
to release some of the billions
of dollars of frozen money

421
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,759
into a trust fund that the Taliban
themselves can't access,

422
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:25,400
which could still help
inject some cash and stability

423
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,440
into the country's financial system,
if it happens.

424
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,519
The UN and the World Bank
both have initiatives in the works

425
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,079
to try and bridge the gap between
emergency humanitarian assistance

426
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,920
and longer-term development aid,

427
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,680
as long as they're able
to get adequate funding.

428
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:41,240
And for the final time,

429
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:45,319
I do get the broad worries about
how sending money to Afghanistan

430
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,839
might inadvertently help
the Taliban.

431
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,559
But I'd argue,
the key question here isn't just,

432
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,599
"What happens if we send
Afghanistan money and aid?"

433
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,839
It's, "What happens if we don't?"

434
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,079
And we know the answer to that:
millions of innocent Afghans

435
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,559
will suffer and die under
a government they did not choose.

436
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,799
The reality is, there is no one simple
solution here that is without risks.

437
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,279
But 38 million people's lives
are at stake,

438
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:15,160
and doing nothing
would be yet another colossal,

439
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,359
if I may borrow a military
intelligence term here,

440
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,000
swing and a miss.

441
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,359
And now, this!

442
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,160
And NowÂ…

443
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,279
Shepard Smith Has the Best
Story Intros in the Business.

444
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,039
With Geico, in 15 minutes, you can save
15% or more on car insurance.

445
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:37,519
Or, in 15 minutes, you could have sex
in a car and get an STD.

446
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:38,880
The poop gave him away.

447
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,359
Miami police have identified
an armed robbery suspect

448
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,640
with the help of some dog doo.

449
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,680
Do you know
what gasoline tastes like?

450
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,279
If not, you probably
weren't poor in the '70s.

451
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,000
Where are sharks born?

452
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:56,480
Is hangry a real thing?

453
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,200
Some things are just better dead.

454
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,519
The next roach motel
could be your house.

455
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,160
Florida, there's
an ice cream problem.

456
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,519
He's a 49-year-old snake collector,
or he was.

457
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,240
When your body's given up,
taken the last breath,

458
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,279
what do you want your loved ones
to do with it?

459
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,920
I'm thinking dump it in a hole
in the backyard of my childhood home,

460
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,680
in Mississippi,
and just cover it up with dirt.

461
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,480
That's illegal.

462
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,440
Moving on. Finally, I want to talk
about artificial intelligence, or AI.

463
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:33,480
It's a technology which, despite posing
a clear existential threat to humanity,

464
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:35,119
we currently manage to keep
under our control

465
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,079
using pictures of traffic lights.

466
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,400
But, make no mistake, once the
machines learn how to recognize them,

467
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,799
we are all fucked.

468
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,680
I wanted to talk about AI
because there's a new popular trend

469
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:47,240
that you may have heard about.

470
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,000
It seems like everyone
is talking about these websites

471
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:53,039
that use artificial intelligence
to generate images.

472
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,880
It's all because of a tool
named DALL-E,

473
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,359
which comes from a start-up
named OpenAI.

474
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,079
You type in a description
of something you want to see,

475
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,279
and a computer
creates realistic images to match.

476
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:07,480
The fun part is, you can be really
elaborate with your descriptions.

477
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,880
The system was trained
with 650 million pictures,

478
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,359
and the results are some of the best
we've seen from computers yet.

479
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,960
Yeah, AI image generators.

480
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,480
There are a number of them out there,
DALL-E, Craiyon, and Midjourney.

481
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,160
And with each one,
you simply type in a text prompt,

482
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,240
and it'll create images
for you in around a minute.

483
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:28,279
So, for instance, you might type in,
let's say "roast beef superhero".

484
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:31,880
What does that look like? Is it
a superhero made of roast beef?

485
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,079
Is it a superhero that saves
roast beef? Is it both?

486
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,359
I have no idea.

487
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,319
But here is what Midjourney's AI
created based on that phrase.

488
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,720
And I have to say,
well played, robot!

489
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:45,640
There's the fantastic roast beef
superhero logo,

490
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,799
the mild-mannered roast beef hero
with legs for arms and no lower body,

491
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,359
the headless roast beef hero
holding a roast beef cane of justice,

492
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,359
and the helmet-wearing
America-shaped cut of roast beef

493
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,240
that appears to have taken
a shit on the floor.

494
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:03,519
All four of those images are now
my favorite roast beef superheroes.

495
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,480
Marvel, if you're watching, there's
Phase Five of the MCU right there.

496
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:13,640
It is genuinely fascinating, not just
to see images come to life in seconds,

497
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,640
but also to see
how AI interprets these prompts.

498
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,359
Poking around on Midjourney's Discord,
you'll discover things like

499
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,559
this delightful frog bumblebee,

500
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,480
or "Judi Dench
fighting a centaur on the moon",

501
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,319
or what the program decided to do

502
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,119
when fed the two-word prompt,
"goose pilates".

503
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,279
Which is,
I think we can all agree, excellent.

504
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:37,319
You can kill an afternoon searching to
see what images others have requested.

505
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,319
Which is what one member
of our staff, Julia, was doing

506
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,359
when she made a fateful decision.

507
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,759
Because she started putting in the
names of various late-night hosts,

508
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:48,759
like James Corden, which brought
back eight search results,

509
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:50,880
including "James Corden
flies a plane"

510
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,880
and "trail cam footage
of James Corden eating teeth".

511
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,640
And I know it can be hard
to see him do that,

512
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,400
but there is one where he eats
teeth with Paul McCartney,

513
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,160
and it's actually very moving.

514
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:04,000
Interestingly, for most hosts,
there weren't a ton of results.

515
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:06,880
There were 14 for Conan O'Brien,
eight for Colbert,

516
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,359
three apiece for Trevor Noah
and Jimmy Kimmel.

517
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,400
But here's where things
got a little bit weird.

518
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,319
Because then she put in my name.

519
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,319
And would you like to know
how many results came back?

520
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,440
It's 493.

521
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,119
And look, on one level, I get it.
I get it.

522
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:27,319
I do have a face that's already
basically a boardwalk caricature.

523
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,599
I've got what carnival artists
refer to as "a real softball".

524
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,319
But nearly 500 results is a lot.

525
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:39,079
And it's not just the volume,
it's the specificity of the prompts.

526
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,920
There's "John Oliver
in Victorian-era dress",

527
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,359
"John Oliver bursting out of a can
of Del Monte green beans,"

528
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:48,480
"John Oliver as an amoeba
viewed through a microscope,"

529
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,920
and "John Oliver commanding a
horde of elves to charge a potato."

530
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,279
All of these deserve to be
in the Louvre,

531
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:57,359
and at least one of them depicts
an actual nightmare that I've had.

532
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,119
But there is one Midjourney user
who's gone above and beyond,

533
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,559
a user by the name
of Postpoopzoomies.

534
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,480
And I won't pretend I loved
saying those words,

535
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,039
but I think you'll agree that their AI
creations are simply mind-blowing.

536
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:13,920
For instance,
there's "John Oliver as Mona Lisa,"

537
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,160
which is striking,

538
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,720
though I believe may be enough
to be prosecuted as a felony in Italy.

539
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,240
Then there's
"John Oliver is a perfect egg",

540
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:23,920
and "John Oliver is an egg
with a bad attitude

541
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,759
so don't mess with him or he will do
to you what he did to Humpty Dumpty."

542
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:29,359
That's just one of many images

543
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,160
where Postpoopzoomies
seemingly tried to tell a whole story.

544
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:36,039
There's also
"John Oliver at brunch with the girls

545
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:38,319
and he's laughing
because Debbie told a funny joke".

546
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,799
Which is remarkable,

547
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,640
because that's exactly what I look like
when Debbie does that!

548
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,960
Or how about
"John Oliver as a cowboy

549
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,319
with a cowboy hat so large
nobody has any respect for him."

550
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,880
Which is really amazing.
I could not tell you

551
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,559
what size a cowboy hat has to be
to instantly dissolve respect,

552
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:59,799
but that computer was able
to calculate the dimensions perfectly.

553
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,720
And honestly:
bravo to you, Postpoopzoomies.

554
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,319
I did have some questions
about your process,

555
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,359
until I found this post from you,
which read simply,

556
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,440
"I got high and blasted
a million John Olivers."

557
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,880
Which definitely tracks!

558
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,160
But the true masterpiece
on Midjourney

559
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,160
is a long series of images I like
to think of as The Cabbage Saga,

560
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,680
created by Postpoopzoomies
and another account, Margaret.

561
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,200
The story starts
as all good stories do, humbly,

562
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:31,960
with the image of, "John Oliver
is very confused in a cabbage field."

563
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,319
From there, we move to "John Oliver
growing cabbages in his apartment,"

564
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,440
a hobby that evidently
takes off for me,

565
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:40,799
given that we then see
"John Oliver gives a TED Talk

566
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,000
on proper cabbage
growth techniques."

567
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:45,839
Which, to be fair, is still better
than this real TED Talk called

568
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,359
"How to tie your shoes".

569
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:49,680
Then things start escalating,

570
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,599
because next we see
"John Oliver throwing a cabbage"

571
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,279
and "John Oliver throwing a cabbage
at a child" for some reason,

572
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:00,440
and then, in a big plot twist, "John
Oliver having dinner with a cabbage

573
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:03,039
because he realizes
maybe he judged them too soon."

574
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,440
That's a subtext that comes
out of absolutely nowhere,

575
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:08,839
but it makes much more sense
when you see

576
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,319
"John Oliver
looking lovingly at his cabbage

577
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,759
having realized
that he's falling in love."

578
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,519
Followed by, "Does John Oliver love
the cabbage? Yes, yes he does."

579
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,400
And from there,
it's on to, inevitably,

580
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,200
"John Oliver and the cabbage
are getting married!"

581
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,799
And interestingly,
it's at this point

582
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,839
that the AI for the very first time
seems to struggle with a prompt.

583
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,799
Because that seems to be an image
of me getting married to myself,

584
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,559
and the cabbage
somehow being there as a witness.

585
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,000
But that's not
what this story's about, is it?

586
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,880
And I don't know what this computer
is struggling to understand

587
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,519
about the very simple concept
of a man wanting to marry a cabbage.

588
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:45,400
It's not complicated, computer.

589
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:48,400
This is why we're not letting you
drive cars yet.

590
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,319
But the story is still not done.

591
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,200
And I have to warn you,
it takes something of a darker turn.

592
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:57,039
Because the next thing we see is,
and this made me gasp out loud,

593
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,599
"No! John Oliver dreamed about being
hungry and ate the cabbage in sleep!"

594
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,400
Which is absolutely mortifying,
and understandably followed by,

595
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,799
"John Oliver crying
into half a cabbage,"

596
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,559
and "John Oliver
will never be happy again,

597
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,039
his heart is broken
but his stomach is full,"

598
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:18,000
which is both tragic
and somehow beautiful.

599
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,880
And if you're wondering what I did
with the other half of the cabbage,

600
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,119
that is made clear by the final prompt,
which is simply,

601
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,559
"John Oliver pouring
cabbage ashes into the ocean."

602
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,279
And what a journey
we all just went on.

603
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,599
This story is a true testament
to life's highs and lows,

604
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:39,000
showing how poetic, lovely, and
weirdly full of cabbage life can be.

605
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:42,759
There's really only one thing that
bothers me about all of this, though.

606
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:46,519
And that is that wedding image.
Take a closer look at it right now.

607
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:49,720
The AI program
nailed all of its other assignments,

608
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,319
but this image,
the key image in the whole story,

609
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,000
the pivot point to the tragedy
that follows,

610
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,200
was somehow
beyond its capabilities.

611
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,440
Which seems like such a shame.
This story deserved better.

612
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:04,039
Postpoopzoomies deserved better,
as did Margaret.

613
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:07,279
We all deserve better.
And that's when it hit me.

614
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:10,160
There's really only one way
to remedy the fact

615
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,680
that we were cheated out
of that key wedding image,

616
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:15,160
and that is for me to provide it
for you now.

617
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,279
But not through graphics.
No, that would be far too easy.

618
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,880
I'm thinking more of a full,
vibrant tableau

619
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:26,000
that brings it all home.

620
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,680
So, please, come with me.

621
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:30,279
'Cause I'm about to marry
a fucking cabbage.

622
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:18,680
Do you, John, take this cabbage
to be your lawfully wedded spouse,

623
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:21,720
to have and to hold
from this day forward,

624
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:26,000
in sickness and in health,
until death do you part?

625
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,119
I do, Steve, I do. I do.

626
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,279
And do you promise
not to eat it in your sleep?

627
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,400
I'll try my very best,

628
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,720
but I think we both know
what might well happen.

629
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,559
Okay.

630
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,000
By the powers vested in me,

631
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:49,559
I now pronounce you
man and cabbage.

632
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,319
You may kiss the cabbage.

633
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,440
No! Not again!
