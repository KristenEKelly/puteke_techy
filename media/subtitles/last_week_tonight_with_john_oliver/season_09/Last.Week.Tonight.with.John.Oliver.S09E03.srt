LAST WEEK TONIGHT
JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:33,920
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight"!

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,240
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

4
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,679
And let's dive straight in tonight
with Ukraine,

5
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:40,600
where it has been
a truly grim week.

6
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:43,600
And yet, Ukrainian citizens
have continued to show

7
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,840
incredible signs of resistance,
proving that they truly are

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,159
the "fuck around and find out"
country of eastern Europe.

9
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,079
Smatko is a grandmother
and a retired economist.

10
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,079
These are the only weapons she has,
but she says she's ready to fight.

11
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,359
"Let those Russian shits come here",
she says. "We are ready to greet them".

12
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,879
Do you have a message
for President Putin?

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,480
Putin...

14
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:18,519
It's a popular sentiment on the street.
This sign is too vulgar to translate.

15
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,400
Is it? We might actually be able
to help you there,

16
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,120
'cause this is the network that airs
shows about high schoolers

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,400
doing heroin
and hosting orgies before homeroom,

18
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,480
so we have no such problems.

19
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,680
So, I can tell you that that sign
translates to "Putin is a dickhead",

20
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,719
which he clearly very much is.

21
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,040
Also, it is notable that "dickhead"
was too vulgar for CNN,

22
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,840
but Molotov grandma got to say,
"Let those Russian shits come",

23
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,040
with no problem.

24
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,159
It seems that she is above the law,
as she should be.

25
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:48,359
Ukrainians' defiance
and sense of humor

26
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:50,920
in the midst of such a brutal,
outmatched fight

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,159
has understandably
captured the world's imagination,

28
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,680
although what some have chosen
to do with that imagination

29
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,439
has left a little to be desired.

30
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,359
To me, Zelensky is a cross between
Churchill and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

31
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,959
I mean, he's just incredible.

32
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,039
Just such a great story,
slash maybe one day a movie.

33
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,960
And people were quick
to cast the film on Twitter,

34
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,639
saying Jeremy Renner
would make the perfect Zelensky.

35
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,080
However... The backlash to that
was way too early.

36
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:19,240
We're in the middle
of a freaking war here.

37
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,840
A little insensitive, but whenever
it does get made, it's gonna be epic.

38
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:29,120
Hold on. Maybe wait for the war to end
before we start casting the movie.

39
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,879
To be fair, "Yeah, a little insensitive
but we're gonna run with it anyway",

40
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,919
is the official motto of TMZ.

41
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,039
And spare a thought there
for Volodymyr Zelensky.

42
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,960
He's got enough going on
right now

43
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:42,960
without being described
as a "Jeremy Renner type".

44
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,360
That's not a nice thing to say
about someone.

45
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,479
Now, as for Russia, they've responded
to worldwide criticism

46
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,000
by clamping down hard
on dissent at home.

47
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,240
Putin just signed a law effectively
criminalizing any public opposition

48
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,039
to, or independent
news reporting about, this war,

49
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,400
and authorities have
blocked Twitter and Facebook,

50
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,840
and are threatening
to block Wikipedia.

51
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,240
Which is an outright attack on anyone
who has something due tomorrow.

52
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,039
The education ministry there

53
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,039
even produced a nationwide
online lesson for children,

54
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,159
featuring a girl asking questions
about what was going on there,

55
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,319
and getting
some spectacular answers.

56
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,879
I have a question.
Special operation, what does it mean?

57
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,800
It's when goals lead to peace.
We do not attack residential buildings.

58
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,560
We do not hit the civilians. We do not
destroy the social infrastructure:

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,520
kindergartens, schools,
water utilities, substations.

60
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:36,800
Except you've literally
just done almost all those things.

61
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,639
Russian strikes have destroyed
"hospitals, schools and homes".

62
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,560
Also, I really don't want to be
giving notes to state propaganda.

63
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,120
But if you're going to lie
to a child's face,

64
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,319
maybe cast a less creepy man
to do that.

65
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,240
May I suggest
film actor Jeremy Renner?

66
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,120
People seem to want him
involved in this somehow.

67
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,479
And yet, despite Russia's efforts
to control this narrative,

68
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,759
we continue to see public protests,
and some Russian celebrities,

69
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,800
politicians, and even a few oligarchs
have started cautiously speaking out.

70
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,000
Which is understandable, not only
is this war morally indefensible,

71
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,879
but the impacts of global sanctions

72
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,319
are now being felt
at every level of Russian society.

73
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,719
The economy there
is in complete free fall,

74
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,519
and watch the level of despair

75
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,959
in this exchange
on a Russian financial network.

76
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,160
Hello, Alexander.

77
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,040
- Hello, I won't say, "Good day".
- Yeah, no one does these days.

78
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,959
Jokes aside, let's do this quick, I'm
sending regards to Sergei Usichenko,

79
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,439
who 12-13 years ago drank
to the death of the stock market.

80
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,240
Today, I'm drinking seltzer.

81
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,439
Dear stock market, you were close
to us, you were interesting to us.

82
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,040
Rest in peace, dear comrade.

83
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,199
That guy toasted the death
of the Russian stock market,

84
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,720
saying, "You were close to us,
you were interesting to us",

85
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,480
and then chugged some seltzer.

86
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,639
Which is striking,

87
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,199
but also sounds less like how
you'd mourn a financial system

88
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,720
and more like
how you'd give a eulogy

89
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,759
for a clown you don't know
all that well personally.

90
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,680
"You were close to us,
you were interesting to us".

91
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,959
Yet, for all the Ukrainian resistance
and Russian discontent,

92
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,319
the fact is,
Russia is continuing to advance,

93
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,639
and committing human rights abuses
along the way.

94
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,160
And it looks like casualties
are only going to rise,

95
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,920
especially given,
after a call with Putin on Thursday,

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,560
French President Emmanuel Macron
was reportedly convinced

97
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,720
that Putin wants to seize
the whole of Ukraine

98
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,920
and that "the worst is to come".

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,879
So, sadly, we have no idea

100
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,120
what's going to happen next
or just how bad things could get.

101
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,639
And what determines
the outcome here

102
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,759
may not be Ukrainian resistance
or Russian propaganda,

103
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,639
so much, unfortunately,
as one man's determination to be,

104
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,680
if I may quote one of the most
applicable phrases in any language,

105
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,639
a total fucking dickhead.

106
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,279
And now, this.

107
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,319
And Now: The Line Every Bachelor
And Bachelorette Is Forced To Say.

108
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:55,040
Clear waters, blue skies, sunshine.

109
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,399
It's magical. Seriously, it's like
the perfect place to fall in love.

110
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,000
Tahiti is the perfect place
to fall in love.

111
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:03,199
Chiang Mai is the perfect place
to fall in love.

112
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,759
Saint Thomas is the perfect place
to fall in love.

113
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,800
Croatia is the perfect place
to fall in love.

114
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,079
Bimini is the perfect place
to fall in love.

115
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,160
Iowa is the perfect place
to fall in love.

116
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,040
Wisconsin is the perfect place
to fall in love.

117
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,879
Fort Lauderdale is a beautiful place
to fall in love.

118
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,959
- This is the perfect place.
- Perfect place.

119
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,360
- It's like the perfect place.
- Perfect place to fall in love.

120
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,639
Fall in love.

121
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,399
I'm in Deadwood, South Dakota.

122
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,279
This is the perfect place to either
fall in love or get shot in the back.

123
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:36,560
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns justice.

124
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,920
It's the thing
best served by Steve Harvey.

125
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,199
This court is going to award you
a VIP moment.

126
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,639
You and your girls

127
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:54,519
finna give you
an additional $5000

128
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,800
from me and my court

129
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,839
and you take your girl to Vegas

130
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,959
and party like it's 1999.

131
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,360
That's my verdict
and that's how I see it.

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,480
Incredible, right?
Just top to bottom great.

133
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,600
From awarding a woman a VIP moment
as if that phrase means anything,

134
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,000
to the entire gallery clapping
for the plaintiff,

135
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,040
including the defendant,
by the way,

136
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,000
to demanding she organize a vacation
with all of her friends,

137
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,279
every Google Calendar's nightmare.

138
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,000
And that is saying nothing
of the MVP of that clip:

139
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,040
Steve Harvey's
little golden gavel,

140
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,720
which he is making
a full five-course meal out of.

141
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,879
Honestly, I wish I had one of those,
except hold on, I actually do.

142
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,879
Clomp, clomp, clomp,
clomp, clomp, order in the court.

143
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,360
Clomp, clomp!
Big man, tiny hammer alert.

144
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,879
Clompity, clompity, clomp!
I'm a gavel guy now. Get used to it.

145
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,279
Sadly, not all courts
are as infallible as Steve Harvey's.

146
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,800
As we've discussed many times,
trials can go awry for reasons like:

147
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,680
prosecutorial misconduct, underfunded
and overworked public defenders,

148
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,920
flawed jury selection,
how we elect judges,

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,639
to problems with mandatory minimums,
all the way to flimsy jizz analysis.

150
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,759
Luckily, though, as pop culture
has repeatedly taught us,

151
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,240
there is a remedy for wrongful
convictions built into the system.

152
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,839
We'll fight this on appeal.
It isn't over.

153
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,959
I'll get the conviction
overturned on appeal.

154
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,399
I'll be appealing.

155
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,560
I'll appeal this all the way
to the Supreme Court.

156
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,800
We will appeal this.

157
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,560
Don't say a thing.
We'll appeal.

158
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:28,839
Okay, hold on. 'Cause let's acknowledge
Julianna Margulies there,

159
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,439
because she is capital A
acting in that moment,

160
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,240
doing absolutely everything
with absolutely nothing.

161
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,320
Julianna Margulies is doing more
in this three second clip

162
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:40,120
than The Rock has done
in his entire movie career.

163
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,960
You heard me. I said what I said.
Clomp, clomp, clomp.

164
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,159
The Rock's been officially clomped.

165
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,679
But the idea that you can simply
fight a wrongful conviction

166
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,679
and get exonerated runs deep.

167
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:54,360
But the truth is, it is far more
difficult than you might expect,

168
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,440
even if there's compelling evidence
that you are innocent.

169
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,600
Take Lamar Johnson,
who was convicted in 1995 of murder.

170
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:03,080
But between his conviction
and his sentencing,

171
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,279
one of the real killers
wrote him a letter

172
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,159
that you would think would've
changed everything for him.

173
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,960
The letter opens by saying
it's pretty much messed up

174
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:13,559
Johnson was convicted
when he didn't do anything,

175
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:16,159
then explains who did it
and what happened.

176
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,279
Believe it or not,
even with the letter,

177
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,240
this is still a fight,
and the justice system

178
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,080
is trying to figure out
how to free an innocent man.

179
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,360
I never expected that this case
would go the way that it did,

180
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,360
that I would end up charged with it,
and much less convicted for it,

181
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,559
and would have to be here
for the last 20-some years

182
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,080
trying to prove that I didn't do it.

183
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,240
Okay, so there's clearly
a lot to unpack there.

184
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,440
That letter didn't say it was "messed
up", it said it was "fucked up".

185
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,799
To the fact it opened
with "What's up dude?"

186
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,200
Which is a weird way

187
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,720
to greet a person who's in prison
for something that you did.

188
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:51,080
How do you expect Johnson
to respond to that? "Not much, you?"

189
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,639
But it is not just that letter...

190
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,200
both the real killers
have now signed multiple affidavits,

191
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,279
swearing that they committed the crime,
and that Johnson was not involved.

192
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,279
And if life were a game of Monopoly,
you'd assume that's it.

193
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,840
That's an automatic get of jail free card.

194
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:07,879
Unfortunately, though,
life is not a game of Monopoly.

195
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,120
For one thing, no one these days
can afford to buy property

196
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,080
and top hats are only worn by Amy
Sherman Palladino and the Babadook.

197
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,360
So, as of now,
Johnson is still in prison,

198
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,879
and it's very much up in the air
whether he'll get out.

199
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,759
And if you're wondering
how the fuck that can be the case,

200
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,279
that is what our story tonight
is about.

201
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,879
It concerns all the reasons why,
if you're wrongfully convicted,

202
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,720
even if there is compelling evidence
of your innocence,

203
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,240
it's really hard to be exonerated.

204
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,960
Let's start with the fact
that the Constitution

205
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,519
guarantees the writ
of habeas corpus,

206
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,200
which is to protect
against unlawful imprisonment.

207
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,080
Basically, you have a right
to challenge your incarceration.

208
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,000
And you can do that
in both state and federal court.

209
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,919
But as this defense attorney explains,
it is major limitation on that right.

210
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,480
It's not just enough to be innocent.
That doesn't get you anywhere.

211
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,759
You have to have something else
to be able to get back in court on.

212
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,600
Yeah, that's true.

213
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,399
In general, innocence itself
is not an appealable issue.

214
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,480
A fact already so shocking, it might
prompt you to go the full Margulies.

215
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:09,360
She was in the background of that scene
giving it that kind of commitment!

216
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,080
Now, what you can appeal on
is any shocking new evidence

217
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:15,159
that wasn't available
during your original trial,

218
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,639
or a claim that your constitutional
rights were violated during it.

219
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,120
But that's already a long shot.
Especially because,

220
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,440
while you have a right
to an attorney at your original trial,

221
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,039
you are not guaranteed
one after your conviction.

222
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,519
Most states do provide
one in death penalty cases,

223
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,519
but even then, there is no guarantee
that they be competent.

224
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,879
And attorneys can be incompetent.

225
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,279
Take Geddes Anderson.

226
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,679
He represented Edward Lee Elmore
in a murder case, and he lost it.

227
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,240
Elmore was sentenced to death,
and while on death row,

228
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,919
appealed his conviction,
he petitioned for a different lawyer,

229
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,639
but was told that he had
to stick with Anderson,

230
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,480
who'd only spent eight days
preparing for his original trial,

231
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,399
and who can only be described as the
most Tennessee Williams of characters.

232
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,559
In retrospect, perhaps I should
have asked for more time.

233
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,679
I never have proclaimed to be

234
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,360
the best lawyer
that ever graced the courtroom.

235
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,440
Yeah, that's not great, is it? The only
thing worse than being a bad lawyer

236
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,200
is being a bad lawyer
with low self-esteem.

237
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,919
In the words of RuPaul,
"If you can't defend yourself,

238
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,120
how in the hell are you going
to defend somebody else?"

239
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,039
And you do need an exceptionally
good attorney for an appeal.

240
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,919
Post-conviction law
is incredibly difficult to understand,

241
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
even for a seasoned attorney,
and you want to get it right

242
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,200
because any technical error can result
in your appeal being dismissed.

243
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,480
So many wrongful conviction cases
are won or lost on technicalities,

244
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,639
even ones that are pretty compelling.

245
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,720
Take Ricky Kidd, a man wrongfully
convicted of murder in 1997,

246
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:45,039
despite the fact "no physical
evidence linked him to the murders".

247
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,799
The case against him
was littered with police incompetence

248
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,120
and prosecutorial misconduct,

249
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,440
and his own lawyer failed
to chase down exonerating evidence,

250
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,720
such as the fact that, around the time
that the murder took place,

251
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,120
Kidd was in a sheriff's office,
applying for a gun permit.

252
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,720
Which is a pretty
fucking solid alibi.

253
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,480
Kidd's best grounds to appeal

254
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,120
were that he had ineffective counsel
at his first trial.

255
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,080
But unfortunately,
when his new lawyers filed that appeal,

256
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,960
they failed
to include that argument.

257
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,679
So, the state fought
to keep him locked up.

258
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,399
Which is both outrageous, and
something that the assistant state AG

259
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,600
was comically unwilling to discuss.

260
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,240
You don't have any concern
that a police commissioner

261
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,279
and former prosecutor
say he's innocent?

262
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,960
According to... Your name
is here right in the court document,

263
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,919
and you're not even arguing
that he's guilty.

264
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,679
Just technicalities that he missed
his chance to properly appeal.

265
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:39,120
You don't seem concerned about this.

266
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,320
Do you even think he's guilty?

267
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:45,720
No answer?

268
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:48,440
I mean, you're spending taxpayer
money to fight this case,

269
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:50,799
you're keeping him
locked up in prison.

270
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:54,480
- It's the best use of taxpayer money?
- Y'all have a good day, sir.

271
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,200
Honestly, I'm conflicted there.
That man is a heartless monster,

272
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,399
smirking like a wax statue
of Paul Giamatti

273
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,440
when a man's life is at stake.

274
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,840
I do also respect his ice-cold attempt
at ignoring small talk at an elevator.

275
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,840
Elevators are flying coffins

276
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,360
that demand total silence
from each of their pallbearers.

277
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,399
We have to reach agreement on this.

278
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,159
And while it's not important,

279
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,600
quick shout-out to the guy waving
at the camera in the background there.

280
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,840
Hey, buddy!
Bet you had no idea that your wave

281
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:26,399
was underscoring a grotesque failure
of our entire judicial system!

282
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,519
But it was! Bye!

283
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:31,440
But that brings us to a key point.

284
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,360
When the whole criminal justice system
is geared toward getting a conviction,

285
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,759
it has very little interest
in seeing its work undone.

286
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,919
I mentioned earlier that one of the few
ways to get a post-conviction appeal

287
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,559
is to argue that you have
new evidence to introduce.

288
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:46,960
But you still have to be able

289
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,919
to show that it would have changed
the outcome at your trial.

290
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,120
And prosecutors
will fight that notion, hard.

291
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,480
When one of the West Memphis Three
tried to get a new trial,

292
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:58,200
based on new evidence,
including DNA,

293
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:00,919
an assistant AG appeared
before the state's supreme court

294
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,240
to try and talk them
out of considering it,

295
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,120
citing the harm that could do.

296
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,080
What harm is there to in allowing him
to present all evidence?

297
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,759
The harm is in the finality
of the criminal judgment

298
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:17,440
that is not demonstrated to have any
constitutional or procedural defect,

299
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,279
and just to try it again.

300
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,120
You're suggesting,
it sounds to me, Justice Priebe,

301
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,720
as though
every 15 or 17 years or so,

302
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,440
we really ought to try cases again
to reestablish guilt.

303
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:33,639
So, the harm is to the criminal justice
system's interest in finality.

304
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,519
The harm is to the finality?
If the final decision could be wrong,

305
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,919
you should want to make
sure that you get it right.

306
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,039
There's a reason that "La La Land"
didn't just keep the Oscar

307
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,759
after Faye Dunaway
and Warren Beatty

308
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,279
skin-smiled their way
through that mistake.

309
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,320
But while, thankfully,
those judges were skeptical,

310
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:53,240
many defer to prosecutors.

311
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,519
That was the case
with Edward Lee Elmore, remember?

312
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,120
The guy whose initial lawyer
was insecure Foghorn Leghorn.

313
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,960
The key evidence against him
were hairs at a murder scene

314
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:04,080
that police claimed
were of African American descent.

315
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:06,559
But there were no photos
of those hairs at the scene,

316
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,960
which is already suspicious,

317
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,120
and the state later
found a box of evidence,

318
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,240
previously claimed
to be missing by police,

319
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,600
that contained Caucasian hair recovered
from the victim's body.

320
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:21,080
But when the judge was presented
with this important new information,

321
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,799
he simply wasn't interested.

322
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,440
This is a completely different case
than what the jury heard.

323
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:29,600
If this is not enough
to grant somebody a new trial,

324
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:31,600
then when is post-conviction
relief ever appropriate?

325
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,080
Unexpectedly, rather than adjourn
and read the filings before ruling,

326
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:40,240
Judge Kinard
issued his decision on the spot.

327
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,519
All motions are denied.

328
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,879
It gets even worse,
because that judge went on to say

329
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,240
that the evidence should
have been disclosed to counsel,

330
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,080
but as far as impacting
the original verdict,

331
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:52,320
I don't think it would have,
and in closing, he said,

332
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,639
"Good luck to everybody,
I'm out of here."

333
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,559
Which is a terrible way to wrap up
a court proceeding.

334
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:59,360
The best, of course, being this.

335
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,240
That's my verdict,
and that's how I see it.

336
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,359
Absolutely unimpeachable.

337
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,160
But the thing is, a quick ruling
like that is not remotely unusual.

338
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,880
Many times, appeals judges will sign
the state prosecutor's documents

339
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,880
without even changing the heading.

340
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,039
One study looked at post-conviction
appeals in the largest county in Texas

341
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,119
and found judges adopted
the prosecutors' findings verbatim

342
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,640
in 96 percent of their rulings.

343
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,799
And if it seems like our whole system
is set up to preserve its process,

344
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,680
even at the cost of human life,

345
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:36,119
during one death row appeal
before the Missouri Supreme Court,

346
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,039
for this man, Joe Amrine, one assistant
AG basically admitted as much.

347
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:46,759
You're suggesting if we don't find
there's a constitutional violation,

348
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,440
that even if we find that Mr. Amrine
is actually innocent,

349
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,880
he should be executed?

350
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,480
I'm asking if that's what
you are arguing this day.

351
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,359
That's correct, your honor.

352
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,200
Holy shit!

353
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,519
You know you're on the wrong side
of an argument when you're asked,

354
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,359
"Should innocent people
be executed?"

355
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,720
and you say,
"That's correct, your honor".

356
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,000
That's the kind of question
that only has one right answer,

357
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:10,599
like "Is the Queen dead?"

358
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,279
The obvious answer to that being,
yes, she's been dead since 2007.

359
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,599
And it's a good thing.
It's a good thing. It's a good thing.

360
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,759
Order in the court!

361
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,440
And so far, everything we've discussed
has been at the state level.

362
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,680
But what about if you appeal
up to the federal court?

363
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:32,039
In some cases, they do step in
to overturn egregious convictions.

364
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:35,960
As this defense attorney will tell you,
that's very much the exception.

365
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:39,720
We all understand that the role
of an appeals court is to get it right.

366
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,559
And if it gets it wrong,

367
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,359
then it will be fixed
down the road in the system.

368
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,200
That's the belief
that we all have in the system.

369
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,480
If some court gets it wrong,

370
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,000
another court is going to come along
and set it right.

371
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:54,240
Federal courts
can only grant relief

372
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,119
if a state court
was unreasonably wrong,

373
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,200
was so wrong that no other judge,
no other fair-minded judge,

374
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:03,559
could possibly agree
with a state court.

375
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,039
That's an incredibly high bar.

376
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,799
Yeah. It really is.

377
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:10,680
Because "no fair-minded
judge could possibly agree"

378
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,640
is a hugely high bar to clear.

379
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
Reasonable people disagree
all the time,

380
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,319
on issues like which way
the toilet paper roll should go,

381
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,319
or how a tortoise
would wear clothes.

382
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,480
Is it over the shell?
Or under the shell?

383
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:25,599
There's a vibrant discussion here.
There will be dissenting voices.

384
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,000
The truth is, federal courts' hands
are tied pretty tightly,

385
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:30,440
by something called AEDPA.

386
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:33,400
It stands for the Antiterrorism
and Effective Death Penalty Act.

387
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,400
It was passed in the 1990s in the wake
of the Oklahoma City bombing

388
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,599
and at the time,
the justification for it was,

389
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,720
we cannot let terrorists
like Timothy McVeigh,

390
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,160
or any prisoners on death row,
appeal their cases endlessly.

391
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,519
Here is the argument
back then in a nutshell.

392
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,359
What about the fact that many of them
sit on death row for years and years

393
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,640
with access to libraries
and computers

394
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,000
and everything
they could possibly need

395
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:58,319
so they continue to drag out
this process?

396
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,440
There's got to be an end to it.

397
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,839
Okay, that's actually
an even worse argument than it seems.

398
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,279
Because remember, this was 1995.

399
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:07,119
The only things computers
were good for back then

400
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,960
were Minesweeper
and still images of Cal Ripken Jr.

401
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm guessing that in 1995,

402
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:15,559
if you typed "post conviction habeas
corpus appeal" into Lycos-dot-com,

403
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,240
your hard drive would spark
into a full blown house fire.

404
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,880
So, prisoners sometimes
having access to computers

405
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,599
wasn't the real problem here.

406
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,119
Although AEDPA sounds like it applied
to terrorists and death row inmates,

407
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,400
it applies to everyone.

408
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,960
In addition to that high bar that gutted
federal review of state convictions,

409
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,400
it also imposed
a strict one-year deadline

410
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,160
to file a federal appeal
once your conviction is finalized.

411
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,160
Which I know might sound like a lot
of time to you, but it really isn't.

412
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,480
A federal appeal
is a massive undertaking,

413
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,160
often involving
doing new research,

414
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,480
speaking to experts, witnesses,
previous attorneys, and investigators.

415
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:56,440
One year cannot be enough,
as proven by the fact that, post-AEDPA,

416
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:00,400
the deadline had been missed at least
80 times in death row cases.

417
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,599
80 times, death-row prisoners
went to the trouble of filing an appeal,

418
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,519
only to be told,
"Sorry, too late, it doesn't count".

419
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,200
And even when filings
do come in on time,

420
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:13,319
that high bar means that they're
less likely to be successful,

421
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,160
to the point that while, before AEDPA,
40 percent of death row defendants

422
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,480
succeeded in getting their verdict or
sentence overturned in federal court,

423
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,640
a decade after it, that rate
had dropped to just 10 percent.

424
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,759
And there was one senator

425
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:30,359
who saw all of these problems with
AEDPA pretty clearly at the time,

426
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,599
and he warned
against what might happen.

427
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:35,640
This just doesn't make sense
in my view, Mr. President,

428
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,200
as a practical matter,
or as a matter of principle.

429
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,599
We should not,
in our haste to hurry up executions,

430
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,200
lose sight of our commitment
to constitutional values.

431
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:47,880
We should not endorse proposals
that increase the chance

432
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,519
that, where execution is imminent,
that an innocent person be executed.

433
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,200
We should not sacrifice
certainty in the name of speed,

434
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:59,880
or fairness
in the name of vengeance.

435
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,119
Yeah! Pretty good, right?
Pretty good.

436
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,279
It is weird to see Joe Biden on the
right side of a criminal justice issue

437
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,440
in the '90s.

438
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,799
It's like watching home movies and
seeing your bitterly divorced parents

439
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,640
passionately Frenching each other.

440
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:16,920
It's just hard to imagine
a world where that ever happened.

441
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,319
So, enjoy that feeling!

442
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,599
Are you enjoying it?
I really hope you are.

443
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:24,799
I have to tell you that Biden
actually voted for the bill in the end.

444
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,720
You don't get to be surprised by that.
The guy is who he is.

445
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,799
And all of that brings us to today,

446
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,319
where many wrongfully convicted people
are still locked up,

447
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,359
with a racially
disproportionate impact.

448
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,559
Innocent Black people are about 7 times
more likely to be convicted of murder

449
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,200
than innocent white people.

450
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:45,359
And those who committed the crimes
are still at large,

451
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,000
as the Philly DA points out.

452
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,240
Justice means that you try
to do things that are proportional,

453
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,240
and you try to do things
that are accurate.

454
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:54,880
If you're trying to do things
that are accurate,

455
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,480
that means you do not want
the guilty person who got away

456
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,000
to continue to get away,

457
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,119
and you also don't want the innocent
person to stay in jail.

458
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,599
Because that ain't right.
I mean, duh.

459
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,799
Yeah, he's right. Fucking duh!

460
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:12,480
You've probably already been screaming
that at your TV for the last 15 minutes

461
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,880
along with "talk a bit slower!"
and "this guy's a furry, right?"

462
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,960
And that's my business. But I will
say this, the clues are all there.

463
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:22,119
But again, he is right.

464
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,279
We know prosecutors are fallible,
even when the stakes are very high.

465
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:29,799
And if you want to see this whole,
maddening system in one story,

466
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,839
consider the case of Melissa Lucio.

467
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,440
She went through
the most horrific thing imaginable,

468
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:37,759
the death of her two-year old daughter
after a fall down a flight of stairs.

469
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:41,440
But the police suspected foul play,
and in a marathon interrogation

470
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:45,440
the night of her daughter's death,
lasting until three in the morning,

471
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:47,319
they pushed her to confess to murder.

472
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,359
Basically, what they were doing
is they were trying to...

473
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:52,559
We already know what happened.

474
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,759
...make me admit that I was
the one responsible for her fall

475
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,440
and I kept telling them
that I hadn't hurt my daughter

476
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:04,960
and they were very vulgar,

477
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:08,519
very rough,

478
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:11,400
very persistent.

479
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:13,720
This is your chance
to set it straight

480
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:17,000
because right now it looks
like you're a cold-blooded killer.

481
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,680
- Are you a coldblooded killer?
- No, I'm not.

482
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,960
Or are you a frustrated mother
who just took it out on her?

483
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:27,079
We know somebody did it.
We're trying to find out who did it.

484
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,680
Melissa, look at me.
It happens, okay?

485
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:35,119
We all make mistakes.
We all get upset.

486
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:38,920
We already know
what happened.

487
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,000
I know that's upsetting to watch,
but it's really important to see

488
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:45,480
just how aggressive
and manipulative the system can be

489
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:49,519
in someone's most vulnerable moments
that lead to false confessions.

490
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,279
After all of that, she told those
officers what they wanted to hear,

491
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:56,160
that she had, in the past,
spanked her daughter.

492
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,880
The state then argued to the jury that
that counted as a murder confession.

493
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,119
And she was convicted in a trial
where not only did the prosecution

494
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,480
keep the jury from hearing
psychologist testimony

495
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:07,759
that could have spoken
to her mental state at the time,

496
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,200
but her own defense attorney

497
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,519
decided not to call her other children
to the stand,

498
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:14,720
who'd have testified that they never
witnessed any physical abuse from her.

499
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,240
And yet, when she tried to appeal
her conviction to state court,

500
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,759
the judge was in such a hurry,
he tried to rule for the prosecution

501
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:24,440
before the defense
had filed their response.

502
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:28,680
And once it got to federal court,
a split ruling denied her appeal,

503
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:31,559
but even the judges who ruled
against her admitted,

504
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,200
"There was expert testimony that,
if jurors had only heard it,

505
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,279
could have impacted the verdict,"
going on to acknowledge,

506
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:41,559
"We are all, though, working
within the constraints of AEDPA".

507
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,960
Melissa Lucio is now scheduled
to be executed on April 27th.

508
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
Next month!

509
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:52,319
And to hear her prosecutor tell it,
there's one person to blame for that.

510
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,279
She has nobody to blame
but herself.

511
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,119
She has nobody to blame but herself.

512
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:00,799
If people say,
"She shouldn't be there".

513
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:03,160
She put herself there.

514
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,880
Whose fault is it?
Whose fault is it that she's there?

515
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:09,319
If it's not hers?

516
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,400
I can take a crack at that answer
if you want.

517
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,440
'Cause it starts with not hers,
and while it isn't a complete list,

518
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:18,240
it includes
the cops who badgered her,

519
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:21,200
the Texans who voted for a governor
who seems unwilling to intervene,

520
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,519
Ted Cruz,
I'm assuming, somehow,

521
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,039
the 91 senators
who voted for AEDPA in 1996,

522
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,119
Hammurabi for codifying
capital punishment in ancient Babylon,

523
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,599
and you for prosecuting based on
a confession that wasn't a confession,

524
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,880
you fucking asshole!

525
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:41,240
With a system so fundamentally fucked,
what do we do?

526
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:45,880
Immediately we can get rid of AEDPA.
We should do that as soon as possible,

527
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,119
especially as the will
could actually be there,

528
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,640
considering how against it
Biden once briefly was.

529
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,319
In addition, we should continue
to address all of the many factors

530
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,839
that lead to wrongful convictions
in the first place.

531
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,000
And when they do happen,
we need to make sure

532
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:02,519
that we've elected prosecutors who'll
undertake conviction integrity reviews,

533
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:06,079
and governors who'll use their pardon
power to undo the state's mistakes.

534
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,240
We need to make this a priority,
because right now, we have a system

535
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:13,680
where people can be wrongly convicted
with bad defense attorneys

536
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,599
and left to fight in a convoluted
appeals system with little to no help.

537
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,000
At which point, it really feels
like our system is essentially guilty

538
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:23,039
until proven rich or lucky.

539
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,880
And that has to change,

540
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,880
because we cannot keep letting the most
vulnerable be casualties of a system

541
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,880
that cares more about quick and final
decisions than actually correct ones.

542
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,000
That is my verdict,
and that's how I see it.

543
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,880
Clomp, clomp, motherfuckers.

544
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,960
Clomp, clomp. And now this.

545
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And now:

546
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,440
Great Moments In Steve Harvey's
Jurisprudence.

547
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:51,519
I'm about to hear a series
of unbelievable statements.

548
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,240
Are we in here arguing about ass
or are we arguing about this funeral?

549
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,119
- I'm sorry, this is not funny.
- No, it's not.

550
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,599
It's really not funny.

551
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,519
You way more stupid
than I thought you were.

552
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,119
'Cause let me tell you something.

553
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:11,319
You ain't gonna get nobody finer.
You must think this is real court.

554
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,359
You can't object
'cause you not a lawyer.

555
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,359
I ain't really
no damn judge either.

556
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:19,640
Is that a pair of handcuffs

557
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,960
with corn on the cob
with a condom on it?

558
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:30,119
I can't make you get married
but you finna have one hell of a party.

559
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:32,759
And that's the way I see it!

560
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:38,880
That's our show.
We'll see you next week, good night.
