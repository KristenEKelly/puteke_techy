00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,719
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:34,719
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight"!
I'm John Oliver.

3
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,799
Thank you so much for joining us.
It has been a busy week.

4
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,079
Al Qaeda's leader
was killed by the U.S.,

5
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:42,679
Kansans overwhelmingly preserved
abortion protections,

6
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:45,479
and there was a big scandal
in the world of science.

7
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,880
A prominent French scientist
is apologizing after Tweeting

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,840
a photo he claimed
was the image of a distant star

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,520
taken by the James Webb
Space Telescope.

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,200
Turns out, it was actually a close-up
photo of a slice of chorizo sausage.

11
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,840
What a great science joke!

12
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,200
Also, this is probably a good time
to tell all of you,

13
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,480
that other James Webb
telescope photo

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,239
was actually just one of those
old movie theater carpets.

15
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,400
You idiot!

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,400
You grappled with the existence of
extraterrestrial life over that photo.

17
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,680
What a fucking moron!

18
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,879
Anyway, we're going to start tonight
with Alex Jones.

19
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,599
A man who answers the question,
"What if Grimace were a Proud Boy?"

20
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,079
Because Jones
has had himself quite the week.

21
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:34,000
Jones under pressure, found liable
in three separate defamation lawsuits

22
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,640
brought by the families of 10 victims
of the Sandy Hook massacre,

23
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:43,680
the jury for this case determining
how much Jones must pay for his lies.

24
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,920
Sandy Hook is a synthetic,
completely fake,

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,159
with actors,
in my view, manufactured.

26
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,159
Look, obviously,
those claims were disgusting.

27
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,239
But they shouldn't
really be that surprising,

28
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,239
coming from a guy
who literally named his platform

29
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,000
after going to war
with information.

30
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,400
Alex, you fucked with info,
and this time, info fucking won.

31
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,560
Not that Jones
has put up much of a fight so far.

32
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,199
Judges have actually issued
default judgments against him

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,759
in multiple suits regarding
his Sandy Hook remarks,

34
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,039
after he failed
to comply with court orders.

35
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,879
So, the trial this week
was the first of three in which

36
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,360
the only question is determining
how much he'll have to pay.

37
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,439
And the way he's handled this trial

38
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,759
is almost a masterclass
in what not to do in court.

39
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,960
Starting with the fact
that he lied so many times,

40
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,120
the exasperated judge
had to say this.

41
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,280
It seems absurd
to instruct you again

42
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,080
that you must tell the truth
while you testify, yet here I am.

43
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,319
You must tell the truth
while you testify.

44
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,960
This is not your show.
Do you understand what I have said?

45
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,039
Yes or no?
Do you understand what I have said?

46
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,400
Yes, I believe
what I said was true, so I don'tâ€¦

47
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,520
Yes, you believe everything
you say is true, but it isn't.

48
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,680
Your beliefs
do not make something true.

49
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,879
That is what we're doing here.

50
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,280
Yeah. And you can understand
her frustration there.

51
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,840
When it comes to rules that a judge
doesn't expect to have to spell out,

52
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,280
"don't lie in court" is up there with
"you have to leave your beer outside",

53
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,759
"it's not admissible evidence
if it happened in a dream,"

54
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,240
and "we do not celebrate
Halloween in here."

55
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,719
But that's not the only way
that Jones provoked the judge.

56
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,159
Because he's also continued
to appear on InfoWars,

57
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,639
which has, among other things,
baselessly linked her to pedophilia,

58
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,680
and shown this image of her
engulfed in flames.

59
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,000
He also went after the jury,
questioning their intelligence,

60
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,639
"implying that his political enemies
had handpicked 'blue-collar' people

61
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,879
who were ill-equipped to decide
what monetary damages he must pay."

62
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,039
He even engaged in the pettiest
kind of behavior, like this.

63
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,319
- Spit your gum out.
- It's not gum.

64
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,879
What is it?

65
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,319
Because you're not allowed food
or gum of any kind in the courtroom.

66
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,439
I had my tooth pulled
a week and a half ago,

67
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,599
and I had
some gauze in there earlier.

68
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,360
And it's been causing me
to have some pain.

69
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:09,680
- So, you're chewing on your gauze?
- Would you like me to show you?

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,199
No, I just want you
to answer my question.

71
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,400
No, I was massaging the hole
in my mouth with my tongue.

72
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,839
I'll show you right here.

73
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,199
I don't want to see
the inside of your mouth.

74
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,240
Holy shit! If you heard
just her side of that interaction,

75
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:26,759
from "spit it out" to "I don't want
to see the inside of your mouth,"

76
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:30,680
you'd assume she was talking
to A, a small child, or B, a dog.

77
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,680
You would not guess
she was talking

78
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,439
to professional conspiracist-
slash-grown man Alex Jones

79
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,120
until at least guess D.

80
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,759
That is pathetic enough even
before you learn that later that day,

81
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:43,920
you could very clearly see him
turning away from the judge

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,040
and putting
something in his mouth.

83
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:51,199
And look, obviously, a lot of this
was deliberate shtick on Jones' part.

84
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,439
He decided to make
this court hearing a circus,

85
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,160
because he's in the circus business.

86
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,959
Which is particularly despicable,

87
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,800
because the parents of one of the
children that was killed at Sandy Hook,

88
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,759
who were harassed constantly
by Jones' fans, were in that room.

89
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:07,680
But there was one twist
that he may not have seen coming.

90
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,000
Because on Wednesday,
one of the lawyers for the parents

91
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,480
introduced a text message
from Alex Jones' phone

92
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,040
regarding the Sandy Hook shooting.

93
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,800
Which was notable,
because he'd previously testified

94
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:18,839
that he'd searched his phone,
and could find no such messages.

95
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,079
And it then emerged
exactly how it had been obtained.

96
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,600
- Do you know where I got this?
- No.

97
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:31,279
Mr. Jones, did you know
that 12 days ago, 12 days ago,

98
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,480
your attorneys messed up,

99
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,560
and sent me an entire digital copy
of your entire cell phone,

100
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,519
with every text message you've sent,
for the past two years?

101
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,439
And when informed,

102
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:47,360
did not take any steps
to identify it as privileged,

103
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,040
or protected in any way,

104
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,759
and as of two days ago, it fell free
and clear into my possession,

105
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:55,079
and that is how
I know you lied to me

106
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,639
when you said you didn't have
text messages about Sandy Hook.

107
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
Shit!

108
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,240
First, credit to that lawyer
for having the superhuman patience

109
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,879
to sit on those text messages
for 12 whole days.

110
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:11,160
Imagine receiving those records, with
texts that probably said things like,

111
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,079
"I know Sandy Hook
really happened.

112
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,040
I'm a ghoul who wants to make the
world suffer and make money doing it",

113
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,720
followed immediately by one saying,

114
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,439
"Can you make the frogs
look gayer in the graphics?"

115
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:23,439
And saying to yourself,
"Wait. Your time will come."

116
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,920
But the contents of Jones' phone
could become a problem for him.

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,519
Not only has the January 6th committee
already requested those phone records,

118
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,439
but they also show that Jones,
who's tried to plead poverty,

119
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,839
was earning revenue
of as much as $800,000 per day

120
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,040
in recent years from sales.

121
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,000
It was determined that he has to pay
$4 million in compensatory damages,

122
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,240
but, as we now know, that could be
just a week's work for him,

123
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,720
and another 45 million
in punitive damages,

124
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,839
though that will undoubtedly
be the subject of further litigation.

125
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,399
And look, clearly,
none of this is going to stop him.

126
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,680
There are two more trials coming up,

127
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:01,800
and he's probably going to find ways
to turn those into a clown show as well

128
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,480
and fundraise off them, too.

129
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,000
But at least, this phone thing could
make his life much more difficult,

130
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,600
and for a while.

131
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,079
And that is something
that we should all be allowed to enjoy.

132
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,519
Because to wake up one morning
and find out that Alex Jones' lawyers

133
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,480
mistakenly shared his cell phone
records is a true blessing.

134
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,040
We don't deserve this, but one
thing's for sure: he definitely does.

135
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,879
And now, this!

136
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,839
And Nowâ€¦

137
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,519
Some Thoughts from C-SPAN's
Most Frequent Caller.

138
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,240
Let's get to your phone calls.
We'll go to Walter in Butler, Indiana.

139
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,519
Good morning. Is the government
doing enough to prevent cyberattacks?

140
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,839
Good morning,
thanks for taking my call.

141
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,319
I don't know the answer.
I have no idea.

142
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,839
Here's Butler, Indiana.
We hear from Walter.

143
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,439
Walter. Butler, Indiana.

144
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,480
Walter is joining us
from Butler, Indiana.

145
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,560
Butler, Indiana. Republican line.
Walter, hi there.

146
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,319
On the Republican line, Walter.

147
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,319
Walter is a Republican.
Good morning.

148
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:03,079
When this whole corona thing started,
I hunkered down in my bunker.

149
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,720
I went and bought maybe
400 bottles of good Irish whiskey,

150
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,040
I loaded up my humidors with all
of the top-quality maduro cigars.

151
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,000
I went to the supermarket
and I got corned beef hash and Spam,

152
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,959
and I've been hanging out
in my bunker ever since.

153
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,720
I love watching TV, I'm old to go out
and do any kind of exercise,

154
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,199
I sit and watch the boob tube.

155
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:25,199
Good morning.
Thank you for taking my call.

156
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,759
I talk to myself, but no one listens,
and now I have you on the line.

157
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,879
I don't have the internet,
I don't have Facebook,

158
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,159
I don't have a cell phone,
I deal with it fine.

159
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,559
If I get a little bummed out,
I go outside and feed the ducks.

160
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,320
I'm a proud non-owner of a cell phone,
a computer,

161
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,120
an internet, I don't Tweet,
twerk, Twitter, Facebook,

162
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,559
I write letters in cursive,
I put 'em in an envelope

163
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,039
and mail 'em with a return to sender
address on it.

164
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,919
And I feel bad for you. You've got
your nice cup of coffee there

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,399
and you're dying to take a swig,
so go right ahead and have one.

166
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,159
Don't worry about me, but thank you.
Go ahead.

167
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,480
That's about all I've got to say.

168
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:02,279
But I'm good on the Spam.
I've still got Spam. Remember Spam?

169
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,879
Used to open up,
put it in a frying pan,

170
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,440
get two pieces of bread with tomatoes
and mayonnaise, and you're good to go.

171
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,360
We'll let you go, there, Walter,
with a reminder.

172
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,559
30 days in between calls, please,
here on Washington Journal.

173
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,720
Moving on.
Our main story tonight

174
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:22,120
concerns something
that's been getting ore and more urgent

175
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,039
over the past two months:
Lea Michele's comeback.

176
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,600
It's an unpleasant surprise,

177
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:29,519
and the longer we let it continue,
the harder it'll be to stop.

178
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,399
Sorry, did I say
Lea Michele's comeback?

179
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,960
I meant monkeypox. Monkeypox
has come as an unpleasant surprise,

180
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,320
and it's becoming
increasingly hard to stop.

181
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,840
For the past several months,
you may have noticed monkeypox

182
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:42,360
being discussed
with an increasing sense of alarm.

183
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,840
There are now dozens of confirmed
cases of monkeypox in the US.

184
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:49,480
Hundreds of confirmed
monkeypox cases in the U.S.

185
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,879
U.S. cases skyrocket

186
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,159
from 1,400 less than two weeks ago
to nearly 3,000 today.

187
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,720
The CDC now reporting
more than 4,600 cases.

188
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,320
More than 5,200 cases reported.

189
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,240
More than 6,300 cases
now reported.

190
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,759
Currently, the U.S. leads the world
in case count, over 7,000.

191
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,879
It's true.
Monkeypox cases are rising sharply.

192
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,279
And that is the absolute
worst collection of words

193
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,639
that you're going to hear
this summer,

194
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,799
aside from maybe
"50-year-old Dane Cook

195
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:20,360
engaged to longtime
23-year-old girlfriend."

196
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,440
Although that's not fair,
it's not that big of an age difference,

197
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,240
they're just an entire
TimothÃ©e Chalamet apart.

198
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,159
Math is fun!

199
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,519
But the spread of monkeypox
is genuinely alarming.

200
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Its most obvious symptom
is skin lesions,

201
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,840
which can in severe cases
be extremely painful,

202
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:39,120
and while the pain
is not remotely funny,

203
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,120
people have been getting
very creative in how they describe it.

204
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,799
I had between
six and 800 lesions.

205
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:49,159
It was like someone taking
a hole puncher all over my body

206
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,919
right under my skin.

207
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,080
It's like somebody takes a dull knife
that is searingly hot

208
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:01,600
and is cutting inside of you and uses
a toothbrush afterwards and brushes it.

209
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,679
Any time it grazes something
or touches something,

210
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,759
it literally feels like someone's
taking a potato peeler to your skin.

211
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,240
It's like sitting on shards of glass.
And I hope that's PG-rated enough.

212
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,559
That sounds really bad!

213
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,080
And this is not remotely the point,
but sitting on shards of glass,

214
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:20,480
while not entirely graphic,
isn't exactly PG either.

215
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,879
If you took your kids
to see "Minions: Rise of Gru"

216
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,120
and the first 10 minutes
was the yellow thumbs

217
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,480
plopping their asses
on shards of glass,

218
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:30,320
you'd race your kids
out of the theater immediately.

219
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,879
Sadly, as with Covid, there is a lot
of misinformation flying around.

220
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,080
There are theories like, monkeypox
can be caused by the Covid vaccine,

221
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,440
which it can't.

222
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,960
And that it escaped from a lab,
which it didn't.

223
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:46,399
It seems a spreading virus, yet again,
is bringing out the worst in people,

224
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,960
including targeting
those suspected of carrying it.

225
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,759
Take this TikTok video
of a woman on the subway,

226
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,320
with an image of a monkey
and a question mark,

227
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,720
clearly implying
she had monkeypox.

228
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,759
It got over two million views,

229
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,600
and when the woman in question
found out, this is how she responded.

230
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,399
Hi. I'm the girl from the video,

231
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,960
and what you're watching is me sitting
on the train talking on the phone.

232
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:10,759
The skin condition
that I have is called NF1,

233
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,559
and the bumps
that you see are tumors.

234
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,000
The tumors are benign,
but they're still all over my skin

235
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,279
and give me health complications,
both physical and mental.

236
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,919
I've come a long way,
and I like me.

237
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,000
But I'm not that healed,
and I'm not above being vengeful.

238
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,440
Yeah. 5,000 middle fingers
to the dumb fuck

239
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:33,519
that thought taking an unsolicited
video of a complete stranger

240
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,559
and stigmatizing them for a
medical condition was a good idea.

241
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,639
That is clearly
not what TikTok is for.

242
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,679
TikTok is for discovering you've
been opening freezer pops wrong

243
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,159
your entire life.

244
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,039
Yeah, you just snap it in the middle!
No scissors necessary.

245
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,480
My whole life has been a lie.

246
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,879
Frustratingly,

247
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,879
despite the fact we're still
in the middle of the Covid pandemic,

248
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,320
we seem to be replicating
some of its key mistakes,

249
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:00,039
from persecuting strangers
to spreading misinformation

250
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,679
to badly mismanaging
the public-health response.

251
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:05,840
So tonight, we thought it'd be
worth talking about monkeypox:

252
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,639
what it is, how we've fumbled
our response to it,

253
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,360
and what we should do
going forward.

254
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,919
Let's start with the basics here:
monkeypox is a pox virus.

255
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,399
It's part of the same family
that causes smallpox,

256
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,720
though thankfully, it's not nearly
as transmissible or as fatal.

257
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,000
It usually presents in humans
with fever, swollen lymph nodes,

258
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,039
exhaustion, headache, and a rash,
though it can also cause

259
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,639
complications like blindness,
if the lesions reach your eyes,

260
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,799
and in rare cases,
can result in death.

261
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,120
Quick note on the name.

262
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,120
Despite being called "monkeypox",
it didn't originate in monkeys.

263
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,440
It was first discovered in 1958
in monkeys, in Denmark,

264
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,279
but they likely got it from rodents,
who are thought to be main carriers.

265
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,159
In fact, it's endemic in rodents
in Central and West Africa,

266
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,960
where there've been sporadic
outbreaks for decades now,

267
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:53,639
and it's actually been transmitting
between people continuously in Nigeria

268
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,399
for at least five years.

269
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,039
The U.S. even had its own monkeypox
outbreak nearly 20 years ago,

270
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,799
which came about
thanks to an unexpected culprit.

271
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,360
Health officials are investigating
what appears to be another case

272
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,440
of an animal virus that
has jumped to human beings.

273
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,600
It's called monkeypox,

274
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,639
and it may be linked
to pet prairie dogs in the Midwest.

275
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,559
The Midwestern prairie dog
is not a common pet,

276
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,440
but some pet stores
have been selling them,

277
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,840
along with other exotic animals
from around the world.

278
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,600
And that, say investigators,
is why 30 people today

279
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:31,080
are suspected of having a disease
that has never been seen before here.

280
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,840
I have one main question,
and it's this:

281
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,279
why the fuck would anyone
want to own a prairie dog?

282
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,879
And you know me, I have an abounding
love for the rodent community.

283
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,799
Guinea pigs? Excellent.
Hamsters? Perfect.

284
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:46,000
Capybara? Big, pensive sweetie.

285
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,360
But it's gonna be
a hard pass from me

286
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,080
on this little plague-ridden
Freddy Krueger.

287
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,759
Look at those fucking hands!

288
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:57,759
Also, quick shoutout to the absolute
dipshit that came up with that name.

289
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,759
Pour one out for the stupidest
friend of Laura Ingalls Wilder,

290
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,559
who saw an animal
that is, generously,

291
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,559
a big hamster that fucked a meerkat
with garden rakes for hands,

292
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,879
and went, "dog!"
and it somehow stuck.

293
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,639
Now, thankfully, we managed
to contain that particular outbreak,

294
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,840
and put a stop
to the sale of prairie dogs

295
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,600
before person-to-person contact
could begin.

296
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:19,320
But now,
things are clearly different.

297
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,840
And look,
there is still a lot we don't know,

298
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:24,919
and information that we do have
is still very much subject to change.

299
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,080
But as it stands,
as of this taping,

300
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,440
the vast majority of cases have been
among gay and bisexual men

301
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:32,039
and their sexual networks,

302
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,399
the virus spreads through
sustained skin-to-skin contact,

303
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,480
and it's believed to be spreading
most commonly during sex.

304
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:41,399
Though, in rarer cases, it can spread
through respiratory droplets

305
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,440
during prolonged
face-to-face contact,

306
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,679
or through bedding or towels
used by someone with monkeypox.

307
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,840
And the thing is, not long ago,

308
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:52,480
there was an expectation that
this outbreak might be containable.

309
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,840
At the end of May, when there were
130 confirmed cases outside of Africa,

310
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,879
one WHO official said this.

311
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,399
This outbreak can still be contained,

312
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,840
and it is the objective
of the World Health Organization

313
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:08,879
and member states to contain
this outbreak and to stop it.

314
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,000
Yeah, that sounded pretty reassuring,
didn't it?

315
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,080
And I want to believe the words of
the head of the smallpox secretariat,

316
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,559
which is
a very impressive-sounding job,

317
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,600
while also sounding like the most
depressing movie sequel of all time.

318
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,799
And to be fair,
that optimism wasn't unwarranted,

319
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:31,399
there were many reasons to think
that we could, and indeed should,

320
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,240
quickly get this under control.

321
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,039
First, because monkeypox
has been around for a while,

322
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,600
we are at least
somewhat familiar with it.

323
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:41,759
Also, because it's similar to smallpox,
there is good reason to believe

324
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,399
that the tools we already have to fight
that work on monkeypox, too.

325
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,159
So, this was not
like the early days of Covid,

326
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,919
when we didn't know
anything about anything.

327
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,159
Remember March 2020?

328
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,919
We were Lysoling our groceries
like they came out of the sewer,

329
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Geraldo was on TV claiming you could
test for Covid by holding your breath,

330
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,680
and we did a show on the coronavirus
on March 1st, 2020,

331
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,799
in which the main advice
that we gave our full,

332
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,720
unmasked studio audience
was to wash their hands.

333
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,160
I even did a little dance about it.

334
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,880
And while I was clearly wrong
about Covid,

335
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,759
I was right about those moves!

336
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,680
I look like Julia Stiles
in "Save the Last Dance".

337
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:22,440
Very white and unnecessarily
hyped up by the crowd.

338
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:26,880
But with monkeypox,
we were in the fortunate position

339
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,519
of having pre-existing tests,
vaccines, and treatments.

340
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:35,359
Unfortunately, the rollout of each
of them has been painfully flawed.

341
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,880
And let's start with tests.

342
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,640
Testing for monkeypox
was initially "siloed within the CDC

343
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,440
and its network of public-health labs",
of which there are around 70.

344
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:49,039
People had to meet certain eligibility
criteria to qualify for testing,

345
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:52,359
making the whole process
"slow and cumbersome",

346
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,920
And "slow and cumbersome"
are the last words you want to hear

347
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
in the early days of a disease outbreak
apart from, of course,

348
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:02,440
the opening lines of "Imagine"
sung acapella.

349
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:08,440
As of early June, we were only
conducting 10 tests per day, in total,

350
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:13,400
across the country, increasing
to just 60 by the end of the month.

351
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,039
Now, thankfully,
testing has ramped up since then,

352
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:20,039
with the Biden administration allowing
commercial labs to test as well,

353
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:22,680
but barriers
still very much remain.

354
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,839
For one thing, there is
only one FDA-authorized test,

355
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,079
which requires you
to swab lesions.

356
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,640
And aside from being painful,
you have to wait until they appear

357
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,359
to even run a test, and they
may not be the first symptom.

358
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,000
So, until we develop
and vet new forms of tests,

359
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,640
like ones that can be used
on saliva or with throat swabs,

360
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,039
our results are going to lag.

361
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:46,079
But what's more,
we, ridiculously,

362
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,200
don't have a good system
for gathering and sharing data.

363
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:52,160
Monkeypox was spreading
for more than two months

364
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,920
before states were even required
to share data with the CDC,

365
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:59,960
making tracking cases across
the country incredibly difficult.

366
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,119
And the truth is,

367
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,039
even communication within states
can be absurdly antiquated.

368
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,519
I talked to officials
in Missouri and Florida

369
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:11,039
who were counting
monkeypox cases via fax.

370
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,119
I think we all,
in the United States,

371
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,799
kind of expect public health
to work like Amazon Prime.

372
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,680
We're gonna get our packages in 2 days
and everything will be fixed.

373
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:24,160
But public health in this country
has been underfunded for decades.

374
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,240
First, the only way we think public
health is like Amazon Prime

375
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:31,000
is that they both force people
to pee in plastic containers.

376
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,200
But second, fax machines?

377
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:36,960
The only thing fax machines
should be used for nowadays

378
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,279
is for ending the sentence
"Remember fax machines?"

379
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,799
And that is it.

380
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:46,200
We didn't know where the cases
were or how many there were,

381
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:49,200
and whatever numbers that we did
have were likely drastic undercounts,

382
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:50,720
because we weren't testing enough.

383
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,680
Which is already very bad.
Then, there's the vaccines.

384
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,640
Where, again, we should've been
in pretty good shape.

385
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:00,079
The U.S. government's actually
been developing and stockpiling

386
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,759
new smallpox vaccines
since 9/11,

387
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:05,559
when there were fears that
it would be used as a bioweapon.

388
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,200
Just watch this segment from 2002,
which features a familiar face.

389
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,720
The U.S. government began
stockpiling smallpox vaccine last year

390
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:17,039
and has placed orders
for tens of millions more doses.

391
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:20,599
We have enough material
that if we needed to,

392
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,200
God forbid,
a catastrophe of a massive attack,

393
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:26,920
we would be able to have a vaccine
for everyone in the country.

394
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,720
Yeah, there he is!

395
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,119
Anthony Fauci, the Forrest Gump
of catastrophic contagion.

396
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,200
But the point is,

397
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:39,119
the government very smartly built up
massive reserves of smallpox vaccine.

398
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,119
It is just one of the one ways
that the war on terror made us safer.

399
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:46,720
But unfortunately,
those huge stockpiles

400
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,160
weren't available at the start
of this monkeypox outbreak,

401
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,720
thanks to a number
of key strategic errors.

402
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:56,200
For a start, incredibly,
we let 20 million doses expire.

403
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:58,160
We just did that.

404
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,759
Which seems especially unconscionable
given, as I mentioned earlier,

405
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:06,000
multiple African countries
have had outbreaks of monkeypox

406
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:09,119
for decades now and might've
appreciated a shot or two.

407
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,000
Sharing vaccines
would have served two purposes:

408
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,279
basic human decency,
but also, abject selfishness,

409
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,079
in that stopping outbreaks
over there

410
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,559
might well have prevented
the current outbreak over here.

411
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,039
And yet, for some reason,

412
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:26,279
we let the vaccine sit unused
on a shelf in our reserves

413
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:31,440
like an expired Chobani,
or a $90 million movie on HBO Max.

414
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,880
By the way, hi there,
new business daddy!

415
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,640
Seems like you're doing
a really great job!

416
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:40,160
I do get the vague sense

417
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,640
that you're burning down
my network for the insurance money,

418
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,599
but I'm sure that that'll all pass!

419
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:52,200
So, at one time, we had more
than 20 million vaccines available.

420
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:57,519
But when this outbreak began,
we were down to "2,400 usable doses",

421
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,079
which is "enough to fully vaccinate
just 1,200 people".

422
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,240
Now, we did have "300,000 doses
sitting in a warehouse in Denmark",

423
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:08,799
but for some reason, officials
waited weeks as the virus spread,

424
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,400
before finally deciding
to ship them to the U.S.

425
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,440
That sequence of bad decisions is why
we've been seeing scenes like these.

426
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,759
Hundreds lined up for
the monkeypox vaccine last week

427
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:22,359
at this clinic in Manhattan,
but supplies quickly ran out.

428
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,279
I came here for like a few days already
'cause I don't have appointment.

429
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,799
I went to the website
and the website crashed.

430
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,400
Been trying to get a vaccine for the
last almost two and a half, 3 weeks,

431
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,559
tried at multiple vaccine centers
and everyone's out of vaccines.

432
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,759
So, here I am.

433
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:41,119
Exactly, vaccines are apparently the
Beyonce concert tickets of healthcare.

434
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,640
Announced with little warning,
gone in 30 minutes,

435
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,319
and will likely have you screaming,
"You won't break my soul"

436
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,160
at the top of your fucking lungs.

437
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,880
So, tests? Hampered by red tape.
Vaccines? Expired by the millions.

438
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,839
And finally, there's treatments.

439
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,359
Remember, monkeypox
can be incredibly painful.

440
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:01,599
And there is a drug that shows
promise in reducing those symptoms.

441
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,440
But it, too, is way harder
to get than it should be.

442
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,839
An experimental drug that could help
some people who have monkeypox

443
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,799
is available, but the question is,
can they get it?

444
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,559
The medication is called tecovirimat,
brand name TPOXX.

445
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,920
There's no shortage of TPOXX,
but it's FDA-approved for smallpox.

446
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,559
For monkeypox, it's still considered
an investigational drug.

447
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,079
The CDC
has lifted some requirements

448
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,839
so doctors can prescribe it under
something called expanded access,

449
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,240
but that involves hours
of forms and extra appointments.

450
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,680
Yeah, and even if you found
a doctor willing to do all of that,

451
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:40,680
some patients are then finding
themselves waiting days

452
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:44,440
for the shipments of the drug to arrive
from the strategic national stockpile.

453
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:46,920
Which just isn't great,
considering, remember,

454
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,920
that this can feel
like sitting on shards of glass.

455
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,880
It is not a condition that you can
put off dealing with for a few days,

456
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,759
like a cold,
or a UTI if you're super tired.

457
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,200
Basically, every part
of our early response to this

458
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:04,480
made things harder
than they needed to be.

459
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,440
And, I will say, there have been
some improvements recently.

460
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:11,519
We've seen some progress on testing.
More vaccines are finally coming,

461
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:14,000
with large numbers set
to start arriving in October.

462
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:17,359
And the paperwork for TPOXX
has been streamlined somewhat.

463
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,960
If you think you need any of those,
you should still be seeking them out.

464
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,839
But the delays we've seen
in fixing these problems

465
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,960
have been absolutely maddening.

466
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:31,640
And it has been hard not to wonder
whether the lack of urgency

467
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,640
has had anything to do with
who's been getting hit the hardest.

468
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,359
This is obviously spreading.
It's something that warrants concern.

469
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,279
What I don't want to see
for our community is the 1980s,

470
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:44,559
HIV all over again.

471
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,279
Where it wasn't talked about,
it was known that it was out there,

472
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:50,839
but there was no pressure
to do anything about it,

473
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,319
because,
"It's just the gays. It's fine."

474
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,480
You have to believe that,
if monkeypox were spreading

475
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:01,720
largely through heterosexual sex,
things would be drastically different.

476
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:06,200
You'd be able to get a free vax
with purchase at every J.Crew in US.

477
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,319
Because it is not homophobic

478
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,920
to acknowledge
who is currently most affected,

479
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,440
which is, gay and bisexual men,
sex workers,

480
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:17,480
and people who participate
in sex with multiple partners.

481
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:20,640
What is homophobic
is when you blame or shame

482
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,279
the people who are suffering,

483
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:24,799
or when you decide
you don't need to care about this,

484
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,880
because you don't see their lives
as valuable

485
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,000
or their suffering
as consequential.

486
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:31,720
And that is where
there are strong echoes

487
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:35,319
of the AIDS crisis in some
of the discussion around monkeypox.

488
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,079
Just listen
to Marjorie Taylor Greene,

489
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,799
elected official
and one-star Uber passenger,

490
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,599
who dismissed it like this.

491
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,359
Of course, monkeypox is a threat
to some people in our population.

492
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,920
But we know what causes it
and that's pretty muchâ€¦

493
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:53,000
It's basically
a sexually transmitted disease.

494
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:56,680
So, it's not a threat
to most of the population.

495
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,200
It's not a global pandemic,
it's really not,

496
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:03,960
and people just have
to have to laugh at it, mock it,

497
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,400
and reject it.

498
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,279
So, I think it's another scam.

499
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Obviously, that is ridiculous.

500
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,759
If the way to get rid
of something awful

501
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,799
was for people
to laugh at it and mock it,

502
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,200
that woman clearly wouldn't be
in Congress, and yet, here we all are.

503
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,160
Greene also Tweeted,

504
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,079
"If monkeypox
is a sexually transmitted disease,

505
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,880
why are kids getting it?"

506
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,400
in an act of obvious dog
whistle bigotry

507
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,079
suggesting gay people
are a danger to children,

508
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,480
when what's clearly
an actual danger to children

509
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:36,119
is the QAnon congresswoman
who once Tweeted,

510
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,039
"The kids at Uvalde
needed JR-15s."

511
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,599
And I know
there is a temptation,

512
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,319
when you see homophobia
like that, to push back and say,

513
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,119
"It's not just gay people!
Anyone can get monkeypox".

514
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,640
Which is true.

515
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:53,400
But it is also true that,
while anyone can get it,

516
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,559
right now,
certain people are getting it more.

517
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,559
And crucially, they are
the ones who should be receiving

518
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,880
the lion's share
of the resources right now,

519
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,119
and specific,
targeted public health guidance.

520
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,920
And the messaging here
can admittedly be a bit of a minefield.

521
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,039
The queer community
may be understandably reluctant

522
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:15,799
to hear some straight person
lecturing them about their sex lives,

523
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,039
especially when that advice,
historically,

524
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:21,240
has so often come with an air
of disapproval about it.

525
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:24,680
And some, in this current crisis,
have been tone deaf.

526
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:26,839
One public health official
here in New York

527
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,440
pushed for a more
abstinence-based approach,

528
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,839
posting on his website,

529
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,319
"If we had an outbreak
associated with bowling,

530
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,720
would we not warn people
to stop bowling?"

531
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:38,039
Which isn't a great way to put it.

532
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:40,960
In fact, an openly gay health
official responded by Tweeting,

533
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,400
"A white straight cis man
comparing sex to bowling

534
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,799
tells me so much
about straight sex."

535
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:51,720
Which, honestly? That's a fair hit.
That's a fair hit right there.

536
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,720
The official who wrote
that Tweet is actually now

537
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,759
the deputy coordinator
of the federal monkeypox response,

538
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,400
and he's been talking about this
with a refreshing frankness.

539
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,039
Like in this official video,

540
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,319
where he walks through practical steps
to avoid exposure,

541
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,160
and then offers this advice to people
who think that they, or their partner,

542
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,480
may have been exposed.

543
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,319
Consider the following ways to reduce
the chance of spreading the virus.

544
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,440
Have virtual sex
with no in-person contact.

545
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,640
Masturbate together at a distance
without touching each other

546
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,599
and without touching
any rash or sores.

547
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,319
Remember to wash your hands
with soap and water

548
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,599
and disinfect fetish gear,
sex toys, and any fabrics

549
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,319
such as bedding, towels,
clothing, after having sex.

550
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:34,839
That's great!

551
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,720
That is honestly some of the best
communication of public health guidance

552
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:39,960
I have ever seen.

553
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:42,759
It's helpful, it's specific,
and it's non-judgmental.

554
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:45,000
And honestly,
it's pretty good advice for everyone.

555
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:49,559
Far more people should be exploring
virtual sex with no in-person contact.

556
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,599
Make sure that you're not doing it in
the middle of a work meeting, Jeffrey.

557
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,039
Although that really
should not be that hard.

558
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,759
And it is not
just the government.

559
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:02,240
Community groups have been
trying to frame health advice

560
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:04,039
in a way that's much
more sex-positive,

561
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,599
making it more likely
to be well-received.

562
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,400
Like this flyer
from an L.A. LGBT center

563
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,720
with the very practical tip,

564
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,759
"Forget slutty summer,
hold off for anal autumn!

565
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,200
Do it in cider donut season".
Which, again, is excellent.

566
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,519
It's good advice for now,
it's good advice for the fall,

567
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:24,079
and it's also a pretty good slogan
for Dunkin'.

568
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:29,319
And while good messaging
is certainly welcome here,

569
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,160
it is depressing that we have to rely
so heavily on it in the first place,

570
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,960
given the many systemic failures
that have brought us to this point.

571
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,039
So, what can we do now?

572
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:42,920
Well, in the short term, the next six
to eight weeks are going to be crucial.

573
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,480
So, we need to be ramping up
testing and data collection,

574
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:49,440
and getting vaccines and antivirals
to those who need them the most.

575
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:53,160
We also need to make quarantining
more logistically possible for people,

576
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,319
because monkeypox can require
as long as four weeks of isolation,

577
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
and for many,

578
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,119
that is going to be difficult
to manage without extra support.

579
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,279
But in the longer term, as if Covid had
not already made this abundantly clear,

580
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,720
we badly need to restructure
our public health system,

581
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:13,279
so it is better able to respond
to a viral outbreak.

582
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:15,119
And I'm not
the only one saying that.

583
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,559
Just listen to New York City's
health commissioner.

584
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,279
It is frustrating. We had a vaccine,
we have a treatment, we had a test.

585
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,880
And all of it was kind of rolled out
more slowly than we would have liked

586
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,480
because of the fact that our permanent
public health infrastructure

587
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:33,839
has not been invested in for decades.

588
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,279
Yeah. He's right,
and he is not alone.

589
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:40,799
Again and again, when we talked to
public health professionals this week,

590
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,559
there has been a sense
that this was a gigantic fuck-up.

591
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,079
Jay Varma, an epidemiologist
who previously worked at the CDC,

592
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,400
told us, "This was a real,
perfect stress test for us.

593
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,039
In this situation,
we were uniquely prepared.

594
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:56,720
We kind of had
the questions ahead of time.

595
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,279
We're going to throw you
a virus you already have a test for,

596
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:03,240
already have vaccine for, already
have a drug your government paid for

597
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,920
and developed and discovered
and stockpiled,

598
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,880
let's see how you respond to that.

599
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,599
And we screwed it up."

600
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:12,079
Which is humiliatingly bad.

601
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:16,119
Basically, on a scale
from one to 100, we scored a "No".

602
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,720
But the thing is,
even if we do contain this outbreak

603
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,839
and even if we build
up our public health infrastructure,

604
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,960
there is a bigger conversation
worth having here.

605
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:29,680
Because for far too long,
we've indulged in the magical thinking

606
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:34,920
that viruses that exist somewhere else,
A don't matter, and B will stay there.

607
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,880
And monkeypox
is such a clear example

608
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,559
of how flawed and racist
that thinking is.

609
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,599
We had 20 million doses
of a vaccine

610
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,720
that could've helped
countries in Africa

611
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,559
that were known
to be high-risk for outbreaks,

612
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,400
and we didn't help them.

613
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,960
And we're still not helping them.

614
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,599
The sudden global demand
for vaccines means that, currently,

615
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,279
zero doses are going to Nigeria
and other countries in Africa.

616
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:03,039
Which I know sounds awful,
but to be fair,

617
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:05,359
indifference to those
suffering from pox viruses

618
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,319
has been the story of America
from day one.

619
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,640
And I know fixing
all of this may feel daunting.

620
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,480
We are living through the alternative
right now, and it's not great!

621
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,519
And think of it this way,
if we can get our act together,

622
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:22,920
maybe finally, this country,
and indeed, the whole world,

623
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,799
can have the anal autumn
that we've all been promised.

624
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,960
And now, this!

625
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:32,400
And Now:
Walter from Butler, Indiana

626
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,839
Has Some Thoughts on Mortality.

627
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:38,839
Let's talk to Walter,
who's calling from Butler, Indiana.

628
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,559
Walter, good morning.

629
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,839
Good morning.
Thanks for taking my call.

630
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,200
I'm confused and I don't mean
to be snarky, but so what?

631
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:48,240
They die. You know, when you're
gonna die, you're gonna die.

632
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:51,519
I haven't been to a doctor's office
since, I'm 65, 40-something years?

633
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:53,079
I don't take any vitamins.

634
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,519
I don't try to eat well.
I do what I want, and I'm great.

635
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,039
When you're gonna go,
you're gonna go.

636
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:59,920
I've never taken
a medication in my life.

637
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,599
I've never taken anything
except a vitamin.

638
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,519
And I got all sorts of like hitches
and problems and this and that.

639
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:08,799
I don't go to a doctor.

640
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,039
And whenever the good Lord
is ready to take me home,

641
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,440
I'm going to be taken home.

642
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:15,279
And in the end, we all die anyway.
What does it matter which way you go?

643
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,400
Just shut up and deal
with life the best you can.

644
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,720
My friends and I would get out
of the house early in the morning

645
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:25,240
and we'd get on our bicycles,
and we'd play stickball in the streets.

646
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:30,640
And we wanted to go up to Sears,
actually hang on the back of a busâ€¦

647
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,440
- And drive up over Fordham Road.
- Don't do that!

648
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,799
The mystery of life.
What's my endgame?

649
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:41,799
To be in a nursing home,
not knowing what I'm doing,

650
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,680
with drool coming out of my mouth and
everybody around me has been dead?

651
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:48,000
Not on my watch.
You don't win by staying around longer.

652
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:51,079
Everybody else passes away, and you
have nobody to care for you anyway.

653
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,640
I just think that you should
just throw out all your medications,

654
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,279
get up every day,
thank the Lord for the day you have.

655
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:59,799
And when it's gonna go, go.
Nothing is promised to you

656
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,440
and when you want to die,
just drop dead.

657
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,559
Let's go to Greg.

658
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:08,920
Thanks so much for watching,
see you next week, good night!
