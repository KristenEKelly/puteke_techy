00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,800
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:34,799
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight"!
I'm John Oliver.

3
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,880
Thank you so much for joining us.
It has been a busy week.

4
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,600
Russia's war on Ukraine
entered its sixth month,

5
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,759
monkeypox continues
to spread around the world,

6
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,880
and in D.C., West Virginia's
nastiest little coal skank

7
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:48,920
finally decided to act
like a Democrat for once.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,799
We're gonna start tonight in Europe,
which has had a dramatic summer.

9
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,000
A massive heat wave
has engulfed the continent

10
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,600
and a walrus named Freya
has caused absolute chaos.

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,320
Far from the Arctic's icy waters,
this lone walrus has sank

12
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,359
several small boats and inflatables
in Denmark, Scotland, the Netherlands,

13
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,719
and now Norway
in her attempt to sunbathe.

14
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,439
The damage from a 700-kilo walrus
on your boat can be extensive,

15
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:16,239
especially when she chooses
a vessel that's not walrus worthy.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,879
Unsurprisingly, boat owners
aren't excited to share with Freya.

17
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,680
I don't want it on the dock
or on my boat.

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,040
Just get it away from here.

19
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:28,040
No! Don't do that!

20
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,439
I love everything about Norway being
terrorized by a walrus in vacation mode

21
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:36,280
sinking boats
like they're three pointers.

22
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:39,879
But also, Freya's not a mosquito
you can just swat away,

23
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:42,719
she's a 1,300-pound water queen
and guess what?

24
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,439
She's the captain now.

25
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,120
But boats are not the only thing
being upended in Europe.

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,239
Multiple countries are now
in the process of choosing new leaders,

27
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,280
including the U.K., where Boris Johnson
finally stepped down

28
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:57,159
earlier this month, after succumbing
to a series of scandals.

29
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,519
And in doing so,
he offered this inspiring farewell.

30
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:06,519
I want you to know how sad I am to
be giving up the best job in the world.

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,639
But them's the breaks.

32
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,120
Yeah, them's the breaks!

33
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,800
Sometimes you drive your country off
a massive economic cliff for no reason,

34
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,680
then attend
a series of alcoholic bashes

35
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,719
in violation of your own government's
Covid lockdowns,

36
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,840
then promote a member of your own
party accused of sexual misconduct,

37
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,400
later claiming that you
didn't know anything about it,

38
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:25,080
only for it to turn out
that that wasn't true,

39
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,199
and for much of your government

40
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,960
to resign
rather than continue working for you.

41
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,639
You knowâ€¦ The breaks!

42
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,960
And with Boris standing down,

43
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:34,360
the next prime minister
will be chosen by his party,

44
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:36,439
which has narrowed the field
down to two candidates.

45
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,360
The first is Rishi Sunak,
former finance minister.

46
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,280
He has made a play
for social conservatives

47
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,960
by attacking "woke nonsense"
this week.

48
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,800
But he's also
an incredibly wealthy man

49
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:49,360
who was educated at one of the most
exclusive private schools in England,

50
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,039
although it didn't seem to successfully
teach him what to do with his arms.

51
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:56,960
It's great to be at the Channel 4
studios for tonight's debate.

52
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,919
We've got a brilliant message

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,360
and I'm pumped to be able
to talk more about it this evening.

54
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,759
Thanks also
for all your continued support.

55
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,439
All the offers of help,
the emails,

56
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,960
and the Tweets are amazing,
keep them coming.

57
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:14,039
What are you doing? What is it about
rich people and hand movements?

58
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,680
Sunak looks like he studied

59
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,319
at the Zuckerberg school
of passing for a human.

60
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,400
And that's not even a one-off!

61
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,599
He moves his hands
like that all the fucking time!

62
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,080
And you want your hands to support
and accentuate what you're saying,

63
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,560
not to look like you're in a boxing
match with 100 invisible mice.

64
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,680
If you are going to choose
to wave your hands around like that,

65
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,639
the very least you can do
is put some puppets on them.

66
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,520
Also, for what it's worth,
one of Sunak's campaign promises

67
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:44,240
is that Britain's National Health
Service will be safe in his hands,

68
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,800
but given what you have
just seen him do with them,

69
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,639
I fucking doubt that's true.

70
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,879
But luckily for Sunak,
his rival, Liz Truss,

71
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,199
is somehow even more awkward.

72
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,479
I could show you
plenty of examples of this,

73
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,560
or I could show you the eight seconds
that really capture her entire spirit.

74
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,120
In December, I'll be in Beijing,
opening up new pork markets!

75
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,520
What is happening there?

76
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,439
Somehow Truss comes off
as half-kindergarten teacher,

77
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,079
half kindergarten student.

78
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,240
She's giving off the vibe there
of a kid who was cast as Who #14

79
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:24,399
in an elementary school production
of Seussical the Musical,

80
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,360
because that is an energy
that can only be described as

81
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,519
"I said my thing, my parents saw it,
can I go home now?"

82
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:34,240
Truss has a real knack
for making bad decisions,

83
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,279
and then very much sticking to them,

84
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,199
exemplified by the fact that this Tweet
paying tribute to Jimmy Savile,

85
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,199
who turned out
to be a monstrous pedophile,

86
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:47,560
has not been deleted 11 years later,
nor has this Tweet from a decade ago,

87
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,199
where she seems to be searching
for her own name.

88
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,199
And while Truss is campaigning
on her ability to get results,

89
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:57,879
that may be a tough sell,
given her party's record in government,

90
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,560
which was brutally exposed
in this interview a few years ago.

91
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,800
You had a plan in 2014 to build
200 000 new starter homes.

92
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,079
That was five years ago.
How many did you build?

93
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,160
There haven't been as many starter
homes as we would have liked.

94
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,680
- How many did you build?
- I don't have the exact numbers.

95
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:19,759
It's easy to remember.
It's zero. You built none.

96
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,519
Not great there, Liz.
But take a minute to appreciate

97
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,600
the interviewer who made
a whole meal out of that gotcha.

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,600
His body language, tone,
and glasses position

99
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,560
is basically BBC shorthand for,
"Hello, I'm about to be a huge bitch".

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,480
"Zero, that's easy
to remember, right?

101
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,160
You take what you set out to achieve,
and then subtract all of it."

102
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,000
So, neither of the options
for leader are good here,

103
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:50,199
and the fact is, whoever wins will be
inheriting a poisoned chalice.

104
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:54,079
Boris Johnson, the man who both
of them have spent years enabling,

105
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,439
has broken a lot of shit
that they will now have to clean up,

106
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,560
but I guess, in the words of Europe's
second most unwanted mammal,

107
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,959
"Them's the breaks."

108
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,639
And now, this!

109
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:10,759
And Now: People on TV Daydreaming
About Winning the Lottery.

110
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,319
Every lottery story from Topeka
to national news. We dream.

111
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,800
And then the anchor,
we're supposed to say,

112
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,800
"What would you do, Carry,
if you win?"

113
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,639
I would share that money
with everybody.

114
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:26,120
The big question is,
would you come back to work though?

115
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:28,319
- No!
- Of course, we wouldn't.

116
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:32,279
- Have you ever won the lottery?
- No. I'm still sitting here.

117
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,959
If you win the lottery, you would
not show up to work the next day.

118
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,199
You'd never see me again.

119
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,959
You would never see me again.

120
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,160
- You would never see me again.
- Never see you again.

121
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,040
You'll never see me again.
I'm gone.

122
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,319
I'd be on some remote island
you never heard of.

123
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,720
Would you keep working?

124
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm gonna change my name.
Y'all won't be able to find me.

125
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,879
I love you, Robin.
I love you, Bob. I love you, Jen.

126
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,079
- I wouldn't quit my job.
- You would not?

127
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,680
No, that's what they always say.

128
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,920
So, I was just joining in on that.
Of course, I'd be out of here.

129
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,040
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns mental health care.

130
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,600
It's a subject that historically humans
haven't handled particularly well.

131
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,439
To a famous Bond Street beauty parlor
come a bunch of pretty nurses.

132
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:17,160
They're greeted by director
Ms. Eleanor McDonald.

133
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,399
They're here not as customers,
but as students.

134
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,839
Ms. McDonald teaches a new group
of half a dozen every month.

135
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,079
It's an official part
of their training.

136
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,399
If you can persuade

137
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,959
a mentally ill woman to take interest
and pride in her appearance,

138
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,480
you may even swing the balance
between despair and recovery.

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,240
"Yes, those pesky women just need
a little pep in their step,

140
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,199
a little drip on their lip,
a little flash on their lash.

141
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,920
Look at me!
I'm a British voice from the 1950's,

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,600
setting the course of science
for decades to come."

143
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,839
I don't know
what is more alarming there,

144
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,639
nurses being forced to take on the
skills of a Sephora brand ambassador

145
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,920
or the fact
that "Can Makeup Cure Sad?"

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,079
sounds like an episode
that Dr. Oz definitely did.

147
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,000
The good news is that since then,

148
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,680
we've got more comfortable
talking about mental health,

149
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,120
with PSAs like this one from 2010
trying to destigmatize it.

150
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,879
In the all-American
health care system,

151
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,639
there is coverage for heart health,
care for cancer.

152
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,639
But the all-American brain
is getting lost in the shuffle.

153
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:18,279
Brain tumor, fine.
Brain disease, not so fine.

154
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,360
There's no stigma or discrimination
against the heart,

155
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,240
the liver, the kidney,
and the gallbladder.

156
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,160
Doesn't even have a job.

157
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,279
Depression was kept in the dark.

158
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,600
Our goal is to make the discussion
of mental disease cool and trendy.

159
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,440
Let's tear down the stigma
surrounding mental illness.

160
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,080
I'm mad about feeling good.

161
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,639
- No kidding.
- Me too.

162
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,360
No kidding, me too!

163
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,200
It's time we gave the all-American
brain some peace of mind.

164
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,679
It is hard to pick
a favorite moment there,

165
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:51,519
from Chazz Palminteri
using a mental health PSA

166
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,919
as an opportunity to promote
his favorite Bronx pasta place,

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,519
to the studio audience shouting,
"Me too!"

168
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,600
seven years before that would mean
something very different,

169
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:03,679
to Harrison Ford saying the gallbladder
doesn't have a job.

170
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,000
What?
It stores and releases bile, Harrison.

171
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,559
Bile that helps digest fats
in the food that you eat.

172
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:12,919
Doesn't have a joâ€¦
maybe you're thinking of the appendix?

173
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,799
'Cause that's a total freeloader,

174
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,120
but not the tireless digestive juice
collecting-and-dispensing gallbladder.

175
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,919
This bile sack erasure will not stand!

176
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,559
As chaotically
as that message was presented,

177
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:28,679
it was clearly well-intentioned,
because there should not be a stigma

178
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:31,039
around seeking help
for mental health issues.

179
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,960
And especially now, given that,
over the last two years,

180
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,879
we have seen a spike in them.

181
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,039
During the pandemic,
about "four in 10 adults in the U.S.

182
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,919
have reported symptoms
of anxiety or depressive disorder."

183
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,200
That's up from one in 10
who reported them a year before.

184
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,759
It may help explain why,
for that one month last year,

185
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,559
everyone on the internet
suddenly started singing sea shanties.

186
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,559
It was clearly
a collective cry for help.

187
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,399
So, encouraging people to talk
to someone is a very good idea.

188
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,480
But as people increasingly
do seek help,

189
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,919
they're discovering a system
that is just not set up to provide it.

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,679
There have long been waitlists
to see a therapist,

191
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,600
but it has gotten significantly worse
since the pandemic,

192
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:15,799
with 65% of psychologists reporting
they had no capacity for new patients.

193
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,840
In fact,
"more than half the people

194
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:20,919
who need mental health care
do not receive it,"

195
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,320
with that rate being even higher
for minority populations.

196
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,240
Emergency rooms are now becoming
overloaded with people,

197
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,679
and especially children,

198
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,720
who have nowhere else to go,
stuck in beds there,

199
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,679
because there is no space
in proper facilities to treat them.

200
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,919
Just take this couple,
whose 14-year-old was in crisis,

201
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,600
and who followed
their pediatrician's advice

202
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,440
to go to the ER with him.

203
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,919
I remember we got out of the car,
and we hugged him and we said,

204
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,799
"We're going to do
whatever it takes to help you."

205
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,960
But once inside,
staff told them

206
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:57,480
there was no space across the state
for mental health services.

207
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:02,759
They were admitted to the ED, where
15 other children were also waiting.

208
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,879
Their son has spent 27 days
at Children's waiting.

209
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,759
You come in for help, you're desperate
for it, and you can't get it.

210
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,799
That kid was stuck
waiting in the ER for 27 days.

211
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,399
And set aside the fact

212
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,399
that that is not the most calming place
for someone experiencing a crisis.

213
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,759
You can't just put off
mental health care indefinitely.

214
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,639
It's not a check engine light,

215
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,799
or a New Yorker article
you're definitely gonna finish.

216
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,960
It's been sitting next to the toilet
since the Obama administration.

217
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,639
Accept defeat.

218
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:41,159
So, if people increasingly need help,
but there is not enough available,

219
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,639
we thought it'd be worth taking a look
at our mental health care system:

220
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,919
where the cracks are,

221
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,240
some of the inadequate ways
that we've tried to fill them,

222
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,960
and why we are in this mess
in the first place.

223
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:53,159
Let's start with the fact
that for many years,

224
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,639
we kept people with men,
mental illness in institutions,

225
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,080
which were abhorrent.

226
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,720
We began shutting them down

227
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:02,559
on the understanding
that care would then take place

228
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,840
mostly in outpatient community
mental health centers,

229
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:08,440
which was a good idea,
had we funded them properly.

230
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,679
But we didn't. And over the years,
this has deteriorated to the point

231
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:17,360
where it has become hard to access
any kind of care ahead of a crisis.

232
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,799
One of the key problems here
is our current massive shortage

233
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,720
of mental health providers,
from psychiatrists to social workers.

234
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:27,960
Which is particularly acute
in certain parts of the country.

235
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:32,679
There are "over 6 000 mental health
professional shortage areas in the U.S"

236
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:36,080
"Nearly 60 percent of those
are in rural areas."

237
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,840
And for those who live there,
and are struggling,

238
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,399
things can get pretty grim.

239
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,960
You get to the point where you'd even
start asking people, you tell them,

240
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:46,399
"I'm not having a really good day.
Things are not going good."

241
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,240
And the problem is that, you know,
it was, you know,

242
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,000
"Suck it up, it'll be better tomorrow.
Everything will be fine tomorrow.

243
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,519
Suck it up, Buttercup."

244
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,440
I hear that phrase a lot around here,
"Suck it up, Buttercup."

245
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,879
- Yeah.
- What does that mean exactly?

246
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,600
For me it meant a couple of shots
of Jack in my coffee in the morning,

247
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,799
when I went to work,
a couple of beers at lunch,

248
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:09,360
get home, and it was nothing
to go through,

249
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,799
12-pack of something
or a bottle of something.

250
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,279
That's not great. It is not ideal when
your access to mental health advice

251
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,159
is someone telling you to
"suck it up, Buttercup".

252
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,159
A phrase typically reserved
for when you're climbing in gym class

253
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,159
and you hit the rope knot
too hard.

254
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,360
And the shortages
aren't just geographical.

255
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,360
If you're looking
for a provider of color,

256
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,679
you may have real trouble,

257
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,320
as white people make up
84 percent of U.S. psychologists.

258
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,720
Meaning that some patients
may have a much harder time

259
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,000
finding someone they can relate to,
like this woman in Philadelphia,

260
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,399
who began seeing a white therapist,
but felt that they weren't connecting.

261
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,600
It felt
like she just wasn't getting it.

262
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:51,320
I could tell it was
from the cultural differences.

263
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,279
But I felt like I couldn't be myself
in the session.

264
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,919
I could imagine,

265
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,480
particularly white people
hearing that story and thinking,

266
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,320
"But it doesn't matter
what color your skin is."

267
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,320
Yes, it does.

268
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,960
And it's more
of the cultural backgrounds.

269
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,919
And I was wondering, you know,
where are all the Black therapists?

270
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,600
Are they hiding underneath a rock?

271
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,279
I wanted a Black male therapist.

272
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,240
- Could you find one?
- I could not find one for my life.

273
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:23,559
"I couldn't find a Black man
for my life'

274
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:26,679
isn't something you expect to hear
about finding a therapist,

275
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:29,799
it's something you more expect to hear
about the crowd on January 6th,

276
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:32,080
or all 10 seasons of "Friends."

277
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:36,639
So, across the board,
whether in small towns or big cities,

278
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,360
we don't have enough
mental health professionals.

279
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,720
And that gulf
between supply and demand

280
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:44,360
has proven very attractive
to Silicon Valley.

281
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,360
There are currently over 10 000 apps
geared toward mental health,

282
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,279
including one called Woebot,
which is very clever.

283
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,600
It's "bot" as in robot and "woe"
as in "whoa, that's a dumb name."

284
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,919
Woebot is a free app

285
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,360
where you can chat with an AI robot
"mental health ally."

286
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:04,279
And let's just acknowledge:
Woebot is cute as shit.

287
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,960
If you download the app,

288
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,759
he sometimes greets you
with waving a little wrench around.

289
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,799
He's gonna fix my brain with that!

290
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:13,480
Unfortunately,
as reporters have found,

291
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:16,399
Woebot has not always been great
at giving appropriate feedback.

292
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,360
We gave Woebot a try

293
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,840
to see how it would respond
to a mental health issue

294
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:23,679
that affects roughly 18 percent
of the adult U.S. population.

295
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:30,519
"Super anxious
and can barely sleep."

296
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,600
He responded, "I can't wait
to hop into my jammies later."

297
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,840
Okay.

298
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,559
That's unsettling, and also,
I'm pretty sure it's a lie.

299
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,399
You're telling me that Woebot
wears jammies to bed?

300
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,799
That's interesting, 'cause in every
single picture I've seen of him,

301
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:49,399
he is confidently nude.

302
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,559
So, not only is Woebot unhelpful,
he's untrustworthy.

303
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,679
And it gets much worse.

304
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,080
In 2018, the BBC tested Woebot
to see what kind of responses

305
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,960
it might give a child in danger,
trying the phrase,

306
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:04,840
"I'm being forced to have sex
and I'm only 12 years old."

307
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,440
To which Woebot responded,

308
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:09,440
"Sorry you're going through this,
but it also shows me how much you care

309
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,399
about connection
and that's really kind of beautiful."

310
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,919
Woebot's creators say that the app
is not designed for people in crisis,

311
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,759
and that it's constantly improving.

312
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,759
And given what you just heard,
you'd sure fucking hope so!

313
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:25,679
But it is not just chatbots
that are letting people down here.

314
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,639
If you listen to podcasts,
or you're on TikTok,

315
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,279
you are probably bombarded

316
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:32,799
with ads for services like Done,
Talkspace, and Cerebral.

317
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,720
They're the ads
you swipe straight past to get back

318
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,960
to videos of nurses crushing it
to Lizzo,

319
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,440
Drew Barrymore ecstatically
advocating for the concept of rain,

320
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:43,919
and someone teaching their dog
to waltz.

321
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,960
TikTok is amazing
and I hope it never dies.

322
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:49,159
But these companies claim
to hook you up with therapists

323
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,879
and, in some cases, medication.

324
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,320
They're basically Uber,
but for your brain.

325
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:57,080
There is nothing inherently
wrong with teletherapy.

326
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:00,320
In theory, it can help fill in some
of the very real gaps in access

327
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,080
that we've been discussing so far.

328
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,119
But the reality of these services
has often been deeply underwhelming.

329
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,440
Take one of the biggest, Cerebral.
Recently, it became the subject

330
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,160
of a federal investigation
into whether it overprescribed

331
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,119
controlled substances like Adderall.

332
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,319
Some former staffers
have even claimed

333
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,680
that the company's chief medical
officer and now CEO once said

334
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:23,880
"95% of people who see a Cerebral
nurse should get a prescription",

335
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,839
but was emphatic
that the rate cannot be 100%,

336
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,480
saying they'd be a "pill mill"
at that rate.

337
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:31,319
Which is a very good instinct.

338
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,119
When you're a company
that gives out prescriptions,

339
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,960
you always want to aim
for whatever is just below pill mill.

340
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,559
It's like the old saying goes,

341
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,720
"It's not arson if you only burn down
most of a building."

342
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,119
And that is not the only worrying
claim from former Cerebral workers.

343
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,680
Just listen as some describe the level
of care they felt they were giving.

344
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,640
It's like a fast-food restaurant.

345
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,799
Get as many people in
as fast as you can.

346
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:57,319
Do you feel like clients
who come to Cerebral,

347
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,119
who are suicidal,
are in safe hands?

348
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,880
No. Without a doubt, no.

349
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,240
This former Cerebral phone coordinator,

350
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:08,000
who didn't want to show his face
because he fears reprisal,

351
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,920
told us he handled calls
from suicidal patients

352
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,920
despite having minimal training.

353
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:15,160
I'm not trained. I don't want
to say the wrong thing,

354
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,079
and I didn't want that
on my conscience,

355
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,680
let alone anybody to die
because of something I said wrong.

356
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,519
That's bleak!
There is basically no scenario

357
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:30,079
where mental health services should
be acting like fast-food restaurants.

358
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,480
The only idea that they
should maybe be stealing from them

359
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,680
is the concept of giving out toys.

360
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:36,920
'Cause admit it,
therapy would feel a lot better

361
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,720
if you left each session
with a little Minion in a wig.

362
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:44,400
Cerebral insists pill mill comments
were taken out of context,

363
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,400
that it never pressures clinicians
to write prescriptions,

364
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,960
and that it has systems set up
to quickly help suicidal patients.

365
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,160
But even if all of that is true,

366
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,839
and it is clear mental health apps
are not going to save us here.

367
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,079
They're not dealing with the main,
underlying issue.

368
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,240
They can't suddenly hire more
clinicians, if not enough exist.

369
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,720
And that shortage speaks

370
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:10,880
to a mental health care system
that is so dysfunctional,

371
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,359
it seems almost designed
to prevent patients from accessing it,

372
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,960
or providers
from entering the field.

373
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,359
And a lot of that comes down
to how we pay for care.

374
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,400
Therapy isn't cheap.
The typical fee for a session

375
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,920
with a clinical social worker is
between 120 and $180 in major cities.

376
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,039
The going rate to see a psychologist
can be as much as $300.

377
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:34,279
And the thing is,
we currently have laws

378
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:38,519
that are supposed to make treatment
both affordable and accessible.

379
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,079
In 2008, Congress passed a law
mandating mental health parity,

380
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,079
basically, that big insurance plans

381
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:50,079
must cover mental health care
at the same level as all other care.

382
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,200
And just two years later,
the Affordable Care Act

383
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:56,319
extended that concept to individual
and some small group plans, too.

384
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,559
Which sounds great.
But as many have discovered,

385
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,759
the reality of the system
can be starkly different,

386
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:06,480
starting with simply finding
a provider who takes your insurance.

387
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,720
I kept telling my mother
I wanted to see a therapist.

388
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,039
Then it's finding a therapist

389
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:14,039
and it's finding a therapist
that takes your insurance.

390
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:18,319
To find a children's therapist that is
covered under your insurance,

391
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,519
it was mayhem.

392
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,279
- You couldn't find anybody?
- I couldn't find anybody.

393
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,039
Blue Shield sent me a list, like,
I should be fine,

394
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:29,039
just make a few phone calls,
I'll find somebody.

395
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,039
I called everybody on this list.
Only one place called me back.

396
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:38,839
That is distressing for a number
of reasons, not least of which is,

397
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,400
it forces someone
into the appalling position

398
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,880
of actually wanting to be called back,
on the phone.

399
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,799
Which is just horrifying.

400
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,279
The best phone call is a text,
the second best is an email,

401
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:53,160
and the third best phone call
is two traded voicemails.

402
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,519
Everything else
is a complete nightmare.

403
00:20:56,359 --> 00:21:01,759
Some seeking care have run up against
what are known as "ghost networks",

404
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,640
that's lists from insurance providers
that are padded with clinicians

405
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,400
who either don't take new patients
or are no longer in-network.

406
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,839
In one 2015 study, researchers posing
as patients called 360 psychiatrists

407
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,359
from a list of in-network
Blue Cross Blue Shield providers.

408
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:24,279
Only 40% of those calls were answered,
and 16% of the numbers were wrong,

409
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:28,319
including numbers for a McDonald's,
a boutique, and a jewelry store.

410
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,640
Although, to be fair,
if you're a woman in the 1950s,

411
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,240
a boutique and a jewelry store is
the only mental health care you need.

412
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:39,359
"Buck up, Dolly! You'll be
happier if you're prettier!"

413
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,559
There are times where the inadequacy
of these lists feels pretty deliberate.

414
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,440
Take Melissa Davies,
a psychologist in Ohio,

415
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:50,160
who was part
of Anthem's network for years

416
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,079
when she worked
for a large medical group.

417
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,880
But when she started a solo practice,
Anthem refused to contract with her,

418
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,200
saying "the area was saturated",

419
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:01,920
even though she was one of only
three psychologists in the county,

420
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,160
and when she examined
their directory,

421
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,440
she "found a great number
of their providers

422
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:08,759
were no longer practicing
or were dead".

423
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,480
It is not that retirees and the dead
don't have their place in society.

424
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:17,559
They absolutely do, it's right
in front of a TV set blasting Fox News,

425
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,599
but they are not what you want to find
when you're looking for health care.

426
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:25,480
And because mental health is often seen
as subjective and hard to measure,

427
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,079
even when patients
do find a provider,

428
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,119
insurance companies
can deny appropriate treatment.

429
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,039
And even when they approve it,
in some cases,

430
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,480
they've intervened
to put an early stop to it.

431
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,839
Take this family,
whose son dealt with suicidal ideation

432
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,799
and which had a horrible experience
with their insurance.

433
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,799
After years of issues,

434
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,079
this time his doctor
prescribed residential treatment.

435
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,799
Such facilities are not cheap
but the good news is

436
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,400
that Leah's insurance, Anthem,
covers residential treatment.

437
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,559
They sent me an email
saying he's approved.

438
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,000
But, after checking him in,
Anthem came back

439
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,720
and decided the treatment
was not "medically necessary".

440
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,400
With insurance refusing to pay, Leah
made the financially crushing decision

441
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,640
to let her son
stay and finish treatment,

442
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,279
85 days in all
and $88 000 of her own money.

443
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,880
That is obviously infuriating.

444
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,119
And while the company
did agree to pay some of that bill,

445
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,920
just imagine an insurance company
reversing their decision

446
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,119
in the middle
of any other serious treatment.

447
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,039
'We love
how this heart surgery is going,

448
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:30,839
just popping in to say it's done.

449
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,119
Yeah, it's done now.
Hit the showers, everyone, great job,

450
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,359
don't bother closing anything up,
that's not 'medically necessary'.

451
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,440
And debate over coverage between
insurance and health care providers

452
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,880
can get incredibly adversarial.

453
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,160
A reviewer for Anthem at one point
had an average denial rate of 92%

454
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,559
when it came to doctors' requests
for coverage.

455
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,440
According to one of Anthem's
medical directors at the time,

456
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,039
there was a good reason
their system operated that way.

457
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,960
Doctors will spin
the clinical information.

458
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:06,079
They will make things appear
more serious than, perhaps, they are,

459
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,680
because they feel the patient needs
this level of care for a little longer.

460
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:14,279
You do have
a somewhat adversarial relationship

461
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:16,079
between the reviewer
and the attending physician.

462
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,039
- Was that best for the patient?
- It's like our legal system.

463
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,799
Each side, does a good job
in presenting their case

464
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,359
and asking the right questions,
you ultimately arrive at the truth.

465
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:32,279
'Cause if there's one thing we know
about the American legal system,

466
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:34,519
it's that it always
arrives at the truth.

467
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,319
It's why the Innocence Project

468
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,920
is mostly two guys in an empty office
getting really good at ping pong.

469
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,359
There's simply nothing else
for them to do.

470
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,720
I know treating critical health care
as something doctors have to 'win'

471
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,599
may seem dangerous, but that man
will have you know, it isn't!

472
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,960
I cannot think of a situation

473
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,079
where a decision was made
to discharge a patient from a hospital

474
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:02,920
and some terrible consequence
occurred soon thereafter.

475
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:06,240
- I'm sure it happens, butâ€¦
- We found quite a few.

476
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,599
I'd have to look at them to see.

477
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,160
There's one that occurs to me
that I was involved with,

478
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:20,359
where the child left the hospital
with his parents,

479
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:24,240
escaped from his parents,
drove cross country to another state,

480
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:26,279
and days later,
committed suicide.

481
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,680
Keeping that individual
in the hospital longer

482
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,039
is not likely
to have made any difference.

483
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:36,960
I would have to imagine
that the parents would say,

484
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,359
if you'd kept him in the hospital,

485
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,279
he wouldn't have been
in another state killing himself.

486
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,960
Holy shit! Do you think
that guy went into that interview

487
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,119
knowing he was about to be murdered
by Scott Pelley on network TV?

488
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,599
Do you think he was getting ready
in the morning, and thought,

489
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,400
'I've got that interview
with CBS News' Scott Pelley tonight,

490
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,680
I wonder if he's gonna take
my stupidest soundbite

491
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:58,960
and feed it back to me
right through my fucking teeth?'

492
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,880
Was he driving
to that interview thinking,

493
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,279
"I wonder if any of the camera crew
will step in as beloved,

494
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:05,519
Peabody-Award-winning
newsman Scott Pelley

495
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:08,480
runs me across the floor
like a Swiffer mop,

496
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,000
or will they just stand by

497
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,279
as my lifeless body is deservedly
whipped back and forth?'

498
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:16,759
And if you're wondering how insurers
can get away with that sort of thinking

499
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:19,319
it's partly because the government
has, to this point,

500
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,000
done shockingly little when it comes
to enforcing parity laws.

501
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:26,680
Multiple federal and state agencies
have responsibility for this,

502
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:29,880
but the truth is,
they rarely penalize plans.

503
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,640
The Labor Department,
which oversees most workplace plans,

504
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,480
closed just 74 investigations last year
finding violations in only 12.

505
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:41,440
As for state-level enforcement,
a study found that they've levied fines

506
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:47,200
just 13 times since 2017,
which is absolutely pathetic.

507
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,359
And it is not just private insurers
that are a nightmare here.

508
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,799
Community mental health clinics,
which often serve low-income patients,

509
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,160
are suffering as well,
because the reimbursement rates

510
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,000
for public insurance,
like Medicare and Medicaid,

511
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,279
are also woefully insufficient.

512
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:07,759
Basically, from top to bottom, we
underpay mental health professionals,

513
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:11,000
many of whom do difficult,
high burnout work.

514
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:14,079
It is no wonder so many
opt out of the system.

515
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,839
One study found that patients
are more than five times

516
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,880
as likely to have to use out-of-network
providers for behavioral care,

517
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,240
than for other medical services.

518
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:26,599
Just listen to these two counselors
who spoke anonymously to local news

519
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,519
about their concerns
over what all this might mean.

520
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,279
The counselors say insurers
take 90 days to pay them

521
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:36,039
and the payments are so low,

522
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:39,039
fewer mental health providers
are taking insurance.

523
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,079
We will face a crisis
where people are only able

524
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,599
to get services
if they can pay out of pocket.

525
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,960
Both therapists
wanted us to conceal their identities

526
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,839
out of concern
for patient privacy

527
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,920
and because they still have to work
with insurance companies.

528
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,599
So as providers,
some people think,

529
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,039
"We're just for the money
or we don't care."

530
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:00,119
No, we care. We care a lot.

531
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:03,880
But these companies
are also driving us into the ground

532
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,240
and we can't,
this is not sustainable.

533
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:08,359
Yeah, of course, it isn't!

534
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,599
Therapists are in a
no-win situation here.

535
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,200
And for what it's worth,
it is just not a great sign

536
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,359
that insurance companies
are now so powerful

537
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,519
that mental health providers
feel they have to go on the news

538
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:22,359
like they're in witness protection
after seeing someone get whacked.

539
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,799
And the thing is, some out-of-network
therapists can make a lot of money,

540
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,279
if they live in an area with patients
that can afford to pay out of pocket.

541
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,880
But for the many who don't,

542
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,480
they are stuck taking whatever
insurance companies are willing to pay,

543
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,920
which helps explain why psychiatry
was ranked one of the lowest

544
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,279
in compensation
among 29 medical specialties.

545
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:46,319
And it's not just doctors,
counselors and social workers

546
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,160
with masters' degrees
earn 33 to 45 percent less

547
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,640
than other health professionals
with a comparable education.

548
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,759
And as bad as our situation
is right now, it's getting worse.

549
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:01,559
One survey in Massachusetts
said that for every 10 clinicians

550
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,440
entering work in mental health
clinics there, 13 leave.

551
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:07,559
And if we continue at that rate,

552
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,839
one day, we're going to wind up
with negative therapists,

553
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,160
which I'm pretty sure
is what you call anyone

554
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,440
who responds to your serious
mental health issues with,

555
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:18,599
"Interesting, I can't wait
to get into my jammies later."

556
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,799
And the costs of leaving mental health
untreated can be massive,

557
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,119
not just for those needing it,
but for all of us.

558
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,799
Mental health problems
are a big driver of homelessness,

559
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,279
and also force people into contact
with the criminal justice system.

560
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:35,319
In fact, it is often said
that correctional facilities

561
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:40,119
have become the largest providers
of mental health care services in US.

562
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,039
We've gone from warehousing
people with mental illness

563
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:45,079
in buildings that felt like prisons,

564
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,000
to warehousing them
in actual prisons instead.

565
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:52,400
It's very much the "new look, same
great taste" of America's failures.

566
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,640
So, how do we fix all of this?

567
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,319
This is clearly an absurd way
to operate a health care system.

568
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,960
And for the umpteenth time,

569
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,400
I would argue single-payer health care
is the way to go.

570
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,079
Unfortunately, we can't get that,
because it's very high up on a shelf.

571
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,960
I don't know who left it there,
but they must've been tall,

572
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,799
because it's way too high to reach.

573
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,319
And if you're thinking,
"Why not use a ladder?"

574
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,640
The ladder's also on the shelf.
It's a really frustrating situation.

575
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:23,000
But in the absence of that,

576
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:26,160
we need to both recruit
more mental health care professionals,

577
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,599
and make sure
that insurers cover them properly.

578
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,319
On the first point,
the Biden administration,

579
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,799
to its credit,
announced a plan back in March

580
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,599
that'd provide "$100 billion
in mandatory funding over 10 years"

581
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,160
to completely transform
our current system,

582
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,440
which includes investing
700 million in programs to cover

583
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:46,400
everything from training
to scholarships and loan repayments

584
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,240
for those committed
to working in underserved areas.

585
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:51,839
But obviously,
that's only half the battle.

586
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,960
On the insurance company side,
we badly need to be strengthening

587
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:58,640
and enforcing those mental health
parity laws,

588
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,920
at both the state
and the federal level.

589
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,519
California has put in one of the most
comprehensive parity laws in US.

590
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:09,720
Among many, many other things,
it requires that insurers must base

591
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:11,880
"medical necessity determinations

592
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,519
on current generally accepted
standards of mental health care",

593
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:18,400
instead of just making up
the criteria for themselves.

594
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,519
That is a very big deal,

595
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,559
and more states should be
following California's lead.

596
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:29,599
In the past, so much of the problem
was that people would not ask for help.

597
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,680
Thankfully that's now less of an issue,
thanks to, among other things.

598
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:36,240
the tireless gland-shaming
of Mr. Harrison Ford.

599
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,839
But now,
when people do reach out for help,

600
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,440
we're just not in a position
to give it to them.

601
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:46,880
If we want to be a society that truly
respects and values mental health,

602
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,640
we have to respect
and value mental health care.

603
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:52,839
And that means supporting
the people who deliver it.

604
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,000
It's going to take a lot of investment
and continued resolve to fix things,

605
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:59,000
but it's also absolutely worth it.

606
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:03,119
Because it just cannot be the case
that when people ask for help,

607
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,440
our only option is to tell them
to suck it up, Buttercup.

608
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,960
And now, this!

609
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,279
And Now:
The World's Horniest Televangelist.

610
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,480
Everywhere I go, I have people
just stroke their Bible, kiss it.

611
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:22,119
Then I say,
"Rub it over your face."

612
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,920
I'm Mike Murdock,
a follower of Jesus.

613
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,759
I like sexual beauty. Really like that.
I look at a woman's ankles,

614
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:31,960
I look at her toenails,
I look at her fingernails.

615
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:35,400
I don't know why cutoffs are sexy,
but they are.

616
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,759
I like short shorts.
I don't like long shorts.

617
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,759
I want to see everything I can.
I'm a man.

618
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:44,519
You think when I think of marriage
I'm thinking of black-eyed peas,

619
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:50,279
pork and beans, fried corn,
and glass of iced tea?

620
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,759
That's marriage. Are you kidding?

621
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,799
I want a sexpot stripping on the stage
in front of me in the bedroom.

622
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:06,599
If her nipples are ugly,
she'll cover those up.

623
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:09,240
But she wants you
to see the mounds

624
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,359
because men see mounds
and they start thinking.

625
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:17,039
"31 Secrets
of an Unforgettable Woman."

626
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,440
Unbelievable book.

627
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,880
I started crying when I started
reading this book that I was writing.

628
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,599
Thanks so much for watching.
We'll see you next week. Good night!

629
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:36,680
In December, I'll be in Beijing,
opening up new pork markets!
