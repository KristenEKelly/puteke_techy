00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,640
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:33,920
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight"!
I'm John Oliver.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,200
Thank you so much for joining us.
It has been a busy week.

4
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,479
Finland and Sweden
applied to join NATO,

5
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,119
George W. Bush basically
admitted to war crimes by accident,

6
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,399
and monkeypox cases
were reported in multiple countries,

7
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,159
to which we all collectively said,
"Not now!"

8
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,640
But we're going to start
with the midterm elections.

9
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,880
On Tuesday, all of these states
held their primaries,

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,960
resulting in, among other things,
Madison Cawthorn losing his,

11
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:00,359
meaning he has now
officially set a record

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,960
for shortest term to ever
be served by a little bitch.

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,879
Although perhaps
the most consequential news

14
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:09,079
came out of the key swing
state of Pennsylvania.

15
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:11,480
Their Republican Senate race seems
headed for a recount

16
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,640
after David McCormick and Oprah's
worst giveaway wound up in a near-tie.

17
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:19,719
And their gubernatorial race
saw this alarming result.

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,920
In the race
for Pennsylvania governor,

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,439
a Trump favorite
won the Republican nomination.

20
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:26,840
Far-right
state senator Doug Mastriano

21
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:31,239
enthusiastically promoted the lie
that widespread election fraud

22
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:34,200
led to the former
president's 2020 defeat.

23
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,319
He also marched on the Capitol
on January 6th,

24
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,000
though Mastriano
says he never broke the law.

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,560
He marched on the Capitol
on January 6th,

26
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,000
something which has become
a weird point of pride for Republicans.

27
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,439
It's like hearing someone brag

28
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:51,079
that they were on the boat
the night Natalie Wood died.

29
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,400
What's more troubling there? That
you think that makes you sound good,

30
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,200
or that some people
might actually agree with you.

31
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,000
But Mastriano went beyond marching.
As state senator,

32
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,879
he held a hearing amplifying
Trump's election conspiracies,

33
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,159
featuring special guest
Rudy Giuliani.

34
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:08,360
And he has made it very clear
that he's acutely aware

35
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,319
of how much power he'd have
as governor over the next election.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,360
I could decertify every machine
in the state with the stroke of a pen

37
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,039
via my Secretary of State.

38
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,960
I already have
the Secretary of State picked out.

39
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,360
It's a world-class person

40
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,199
that knows voting integrity
better than anyone else in the nation,

41
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,759
and I already have a team that's
gonna be built around that individual.

42
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,439
That is ominous. Because
I don't know who he's got in mind,

43
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,840
but I do know that there is no way
they are a world-class person.

44
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:40,280
Because, one, anyone Mastriano
likes is immediately suspicious,

45
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,400
and two, the only truly "world-class"
people on the planet

46
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:46,039
are Dolly Parton and... end of list.

47
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,199
Even if Mastriano didn't seem hell-bent
on throwing elections to Trump,

48
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,960
he would be a nightmare.

49
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:57,120
He's promised to establish Pennsylvania
as a Second Amendment Sanctuary,

50
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,400
and supports a total ban on abortion,
with no exceptions for rape, incest,

51
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:04,039
or situations
where the mother might die.

52
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,439
Which isn't a surprise, as he tends
to wear his faith on his sleeve,

53
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,560
and sometimes
even around his neck,

54
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:13,719
with an array of message ties,
including this burgundy disaster

55
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,159
that says, "Gave proof through
the night, in God we trust,"

56
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,319
which is not how that song goes,

57
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,680
this chaotic nightmare with words
like "praise God" and "praise him"

58
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:26,960
in a design I can only describe
as "biblical Xerox mistake",

59
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,479
and this one that says,
"With God, all things are possible",

60
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,639
which I'm guessing

61
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:35,240
comes from the JC Penney
"youth minister DUI hearing" section.

62
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:38,439
And Mastriano has flirted
with the extreme fringes of his party.

63
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,120
Just recently,
he was advertised as a speaker

64
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,960
for a conference organized
by "Francine and Allen Fosdick,

65
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:47,719
self-described prophets
who have long promoted QAnon".

66
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,879
While Mastriano's spokesperson has
tried to distance him from those people

67
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,199
saying he strongly condemns
the QAnon conspiracy,

68
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,919
he not only turned up to the event,

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,879
but was presented onstage
with an unusual gift.

70
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,960
We just thank you
for being a part of this conference.

71
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,919
Being a part of all of our lives,

72
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,479
and really making a difference and
setting a precedent for Pennsylvania,

73
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,240
but not only Pennsylvania,
for our country.

74
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,599
Thank you, both of you,
so much.

75
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,839
Where's Goliath?

76
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,439
It's genuinely hard
to pick the wildest part of that,

77
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,560
from the plastic eagle that seems
to be telepathically screaming

78
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,920
"I had nothing to do with this",

79
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:37,639
to this gentleman's
all-American flag eleganza,

80
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,560
to the fact that Mastriano
was given a full-sized sword as a gift,

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,920
a token of appreciation that screams,
"Have fun getting this to your car".

82
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,639
The fact is, Mastriano
is now the Republican nominee,

83
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,839
and will be running this fall against
Democratic candidate Josh Shapiro,

84
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,600
who is currently the state's AG.

85
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,439
He actually ran unopposed,
so he didn't have to campaign,

86
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,680
but he chose to get involved
in the Republican race anyway,

87
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,879
by running ads clearly designed
to boost Mastriano

88
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,680
among the conservative base.

89
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,800
If Mastriano wins, it's a win
for what Donald Trump stands for.

90
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:14,879
This statewide ad is paid
for by Shapiro for Pennsylvania.

91
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,240
Gambling that by boosting a more
right-wing candidate in a swing state,

92
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,639
Democrats come out on top
this November.

93
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,040
That is fucking risky.

94
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,160
I get the tactic
behind wanting to choose an opponent

95
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,560
that you think
you have a better chance of beating.

96
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,439
But as has been made painfully clear
over the last decade,

97
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,040
the most extreme Republican
isn't necessarily the least electable.

98
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,319
I hope Democrats know
what they're doing with Mastriano,

99
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:44,560
but they would be making
a huge mistake in underestimating him.

100
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,439
Because, if I may quote
my own favorite tie,

101
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,279
"All things are possible,

102
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,600
and most of those possibilities
are very bad".

103
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,879
And now, this!

104
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,279
And Now:
Some Things They Say in Texas.

105
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:03,560
There's a saying in Texas,
when you're bird hunting,

106
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,720
shoot at everything,
take credit for anything that falls.

107
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,519
As we say down here in Texas,

108
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,560
why use a nutcracker if you've
got access to a sledgehammer?

109
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,560
We have a saying, the only thing you
find in Texas in the middle of the road

110
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,199
is yellow stripes
and dead armadillos.

111
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,959
We say in Texas, for every rat
you see, there's 50 you don't.

112
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,240
As we say back in Texas, don't pee
on my boots and tell me it's raining.

113
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:25,399
Like we say in Texas,
come and get it.

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,759
In Texas,
we have a deal called,

115
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,560
don't let your alligator mouth overload
your hummingbird rear end.

116
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,639
I'm not even sure
what that means.

117
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,839
As they say in Texas,
hogs get slaughtered.

118
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,600
So, if he were bacon,
he wouldn't even sizzle.

119
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,199
It looks like a hornswoggle.

120
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,800
Close the barn door
before the cow gets out.

121
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,959
As we say in Texas,
that ain't no polar bear.

122
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,319
Basically how we look at this
down in Texas, all hat, no cattle.

123
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:54,519
As they say down in Texas,
all hat and no cattle.

124
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,800
- She's all hat, and no cattle.
- All hat, no cattle.

125
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,040
What the Texans call all cattle,
no hat.

126
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,279
No!

127
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:09,879
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns sandwiches.

128
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:13,879
Specifically, Subway sandwiches,
Dad's attempt at dinner.

129
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:16,879
It can seem like Subway's
in the news pretty often,

130
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:19,240
and it is rarely for anything good.

131
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,240
Fast-food chain Subway
being sued for fraud,

132
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,519
accused of selling tuna
that isn't actually tuna.

133
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,079
Ireland's Supreme Court says Subway's
bread can't legally be called bread

134
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,079
because it contains too much sugar.

135
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,199
Subway customers are filing lawsuits
against the global sandwich chain,

136
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:39,680
saying its footlong sandwiches
aren't really a foot long.

137
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,199
These are the shocking pictures
that started everything.

138
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:44,240
They were posted
on a social media site,

139
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,319
and one shows
a man putting his genitals

140
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,519
on what appears to be
Subway bread dough

141
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,160
with the caption, "I will be
your sandwich artist today."

142
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,079
Blurred or not, that penis isn't even
the most offensive part of that photo.

143
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:01,199
Look at the bread. It looks
like a child's drawing of Ed Sheeran.

144
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,800
The sad thing is by touching
the bread with that penis,

145
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,959
the penis is ruined forever.

146
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,079
He's got no choice
but to just throw it in the trash.

147
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,000
But of course, when you hear
"PR nightmare for Subway",

148
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,680
your head immediately
goes to this man, Jared.

149
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,920
He was the face of Subway for 15 years
after claiming that he lost 200 pounds,

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,279
thanks in part
to eating Subway every day.

151
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,720
He even featured
in news puff pieces like this one

152
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,279
that play a lot differently
in hindsight.

153
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,279
Jared takes his pants on the road
200 days a year,

154
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,120
speaking to kids about nutrition.

155
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,879
Everybody needs to make sure they
make really good healthy decisions,

156
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,360
so they never,
ever put themselves in a position

157
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,799
to have to wear
Jared's old pair of pants.

158
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:47,879
Yeah, you heard him, kids!
Stay out of Jared's pants.

159
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,600
Nothing good happens in there.

160
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,879
Subway has been on the receiving
end of a lot of terrible stories,

161
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,960
and to deal
with each one just quickly:

162
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,559
Jared is a monster and Subway
should've always been suspicious

163
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,320
of a man willing to eat
their terrible product every day.

164
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:04,720
Not a footlong? That is a bullshit
lawsuit, it didn't go anywhere.

165
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:07,639
Dough-dong? That did happen,
and it's objectively funny.

166
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,960
Ireland's court ruling that Subway's
bread can't be called bread?

167
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,639
The company insists, "Subway's
bread is, of course, bread."

168
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,440
If you're curious about the tuna,
visit Subway-tuna-facts-dot-com,

169
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,759
a real website the company felt
it had to launch to debunk tuna myths.

170
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,960
Although the moment
that you've done that,

171
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:29,279
it does feel like you're already
losing the argument.

172
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,879
But even putting
all of those stories aside,

173
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,559
Subway is still worth talking about
tonight, for a number of reasons,

174
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:38,799
starting with the fact
it's a lot bigger than you might think.

175
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,200
Subway's actually the biggest
restaurant chain in the U.S.

176
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,639
by number of locations,

177
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,759
and they had the most locations
of any restaurant worldwide,

178
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,279
beating both Starbucks
and McDonald's.

179
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,559
But in recent years,
things have taken a turn.

180
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,399
Thousands of its restaurants
have closed, and some franchisees,

181
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,440
that's the people who own
and operate their restaurants,

182
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,639
are getting restless.

183
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,360
In the U.S., 100 of them got together
and wrote an open letter last year,

184
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,559
stating that "for many of us, this
dream has turned into a nightmare."

185
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,879
And overseas, franchisees
have given interviews like this.

186
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,120
- Are franchisees frightened?
- People are terrified.

187
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,000
I feel threatened
because I'm scared if they target us.

188
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,440
Franchisees claim
many want to get out

189
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,480
but say they can't
because head office won't approve it

190
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:26,200
unless expensive
refurbishments are done.

191
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,840
We want to escape, but they
make it impossible for us to sell.

192
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,799
Holy shit!

193
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:34,919
You know it's serious
when they use a voice modulator

194
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,159
that can only be described
as Autotuned Andre the Giant.

195
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,000
Remember, this is about a restaurant
that sells ham sandwiches.

196
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,679
What's the worst Subway could do
to that man? Make him eat one?

197
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,559
If franchisees are giving interviews
like they're in witness protection,

198
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:54,559
and the public is constantly debating
if your bread is bread,

199
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,639
your tuna is tuna, and whether or not
your sandwiches are filled with dicks,

200
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,919
something has clearly
gone very wrong.

201
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,200
So tonight,
let's talk about Subway,

202
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,919
where it came from,
what its business model is,

203
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,519
and why there are
so fucking many of them.

204
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,399
Let's start with a little history.

205
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,360
Subway was founded
as a single sub shop

206
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,360
called Pete's Super Submarines
back in 1965 by Fred DeLuca,

207
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,960
who ran the company
until his death in 2015.

208
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,000
And to give you just a sense
of what kind of manager he was,

209
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,519
the company once distributed a not safe
for work calendar to its employees,

210
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,799
featuring photos
of shirtless Subway executives,

211
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:32,320
including Fred as Mr. January.

212
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,600
I have a lot to say about this.

213
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:38,159
The least important of which is,
why is this guy in a bathroom?

214
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,679
The theme is clearly
"business but make it nipples",

215
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,159
not "polaroids of Uncle Dale
before a scrub-down".

216
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:50,519
From the very beginning, DeLuca
was obsessed with expansion.

217
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,159
Even though the business
"didn't make a profit for 15 years",

218
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,600
he kept opening Subways anyway,
in order to, as he later said,

219
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,759
"create the image of success",

220
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,720
so it really seems that Subway's
business strategy was basically,

221
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:05,159
"Fake it 'til you make it",
which apparently,

222
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,480
our lawyers say I cannot suggest
also applies to their tuna, so I won't.

223
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,559
I will not suggest that.

224
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,559
The point is, DeLuca
had an insatiable desire for growth.

225
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,840
Which may be why, in the mid '70s,
Subway moved to the franchise model.

226
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:25,519
The benefit for the company being that
they could have more locations that way

227
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,240
and the benefit for franchisees,
theoretically,

228
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,720
being that they could sell
a product with brand recognition,

229
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,679
with the promise
of being their own boss.

230
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,120
And there's actually one other key
draw about Subway specifically,

231
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,840
and that is just how simple it is
to open one.

232
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,039
Subway's extreme ubiquity all comes
down to their streamlined setup.

233
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,279
No deep fryers, no gas grills,
so they can build pretty much anywhere.

234
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,519
Got a plug? That's practically
all it takes to open a Subway.

235
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,519
It's true! You really don't need
that much to open a Subway,

236
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,519
although I'm not sure how reassuring
it is that all you need is a plug.

237
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,679
It is a restaurant serving human food,
not an air mattress.

238
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,080
But Subway's start-up costs

239
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:09,240
have been significantly lower
than many of its competitors.

240
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:14,120
It usually costs between around 200
and $500,000 to open a Subway,

241
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,840
compared with a McDonald's,

242
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,200
which can cost between 1.3
and nearly two and a half million.

243
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,600
It might help explain

244
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:23,559
why Subway owners
tend to be individuals and families,

245
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,080
many of them immigrants,
unlike chains such as McDonald's,

246
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:29,799
where many restaurants
are operated by investment firms.

247
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:34,039
But that low entry fee
comes with some significant catches.

248
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,600
Subways bring in a lot less money
than other chains.

249
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:40,519
An average one
generates around $400,000 a year,

250
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,600
compared to the average Jimmy Johns,
which brings in more than double that,

251
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:46,960
or an average McDonald's,
which generates over three million.

252
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,360
But on top of that,
Subway franchisees also have to pay

253
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,360
a lot more of what they make
back to their company.

254
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,039
While McDonald's asks its restaurants
to pay them 8 percent of gross sales,

255
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,399
Subway demands 12 and a half percent,
specifically, an 8 percent royalty fee,

256
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,759
and another four and a half percent
that goes toward advertising.

257
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,039
Those are some of the highest fees
of any chain.

258
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,360
Although I will say, Subway
puts those ad fees to heavy use.

259
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,240
Because they are the reason
that you can't turn on your TV

260
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,840
without being bombarded

261
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:22,480
by commercials featuring Steph Curry,
Tom Brady, and Megan Rapinoe

262
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:24,759
pretending they're all standing
in the same place

263
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,039
and willing to put sloppy bread cannons
into their god bods.

264
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,000
And it's not just ads, Subway has done a
significant amount of product placement

265
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,639
in shows and movies
like "The Biggest Loser",

266
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,480
"To All the Boys I've Loved Before",
and "Chuck".

267
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,159
I was even part
of one of them years ago,

268
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,039
in an episode of "Community,"
which I have zero memory of filming.

269
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:50,879
But unlike my forgettable days
as a corporate sandwich vessel,

270
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,879
some of that placement
is pretty hard to miss,

271
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,799
like in this incredible scene
from "Hawaii Five-0".

272
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,799
This Subway sandwich, so ono.

273
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:02,480
So you're eating these to lose weight?
Is that right?

274
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:05,440
It worked for Jared,
and that boy was large.

275
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But the best thing about it,
they make it any way you want it.

276
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:10,759
Check this one.

277
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,960
The sweet onion chicken teriyaki
with jalapenos and banana peppers.

278
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,320
Now, you put that with this,
a turkey BLT, bam!

279
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,559
That's some serious
culinary fusion.

280
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,000
That scene reminds me
of an old Hollywood saying:

281
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,360
"Every ad exec
wants to be a television writer

282
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,000
and every television writer
is dead inside".

283
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,080
But incredibly, even that is subtle
next to the product placemen

284
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:39,799
that Subway engages in overseas,
particularly in Korean dramas,

285
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:43,080
where every plot point
seems to occur at a Subway.

286
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,480
Here is two characters
having a meeting at one,

287
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:48,799
here is a group of men celebrating
the fact, real plot point, by the way,

288
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:51,000
their friend's
just woke up from a coma,

289
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,919
then there is this scene, which is,
I swear I'm not making this up,

290
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,559
about a ghost magically
eating a Subway sandwich.

291
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,519
Subway released its own mini-drama
on YouTube called "Someway".

292
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,240
I'm going to show you a scene from it,
and I warn you, it is breathtaking.

293
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:08,960
Han woo-rim!

294
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,840
Where are you running from?

295
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,720
Why aren't you picking up
your phone?

296
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,120
I was working, so I hadn't
checked my phone until now.

297
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,200
Is everything okay?

298
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,120
I like the steak
and cheese sandwich.

299
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,159
- What?
- You told me I would like it.

300
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:34,759
- I like the steak and cheese sandwich.
- What are you talking about?

301
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,120
I'm saying I like you, Oppa!

302
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:43,480
What?

303
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:06,519
It's good.
I mean, it's really good.

304
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,960
And not that you need it,
but here is some context:

305
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:13,000
that character was dating this guy,
who works at Subway,

306
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,920
and every day she ordered
the plant-based sandwich

307
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,720
because he recommended it to her,
until one day, this guy,

308
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,920
who, wait for it,
also works at Subway,

309
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,119
recommended the steak and cheese
sandwich for her to mix it up.

310
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,079
The sandwiches
were a metaphor, you see?

311
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,359
She had a decision to make: stay with
her usual or go with a new flavor?

312
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,880
Which will she choose,
plant or steak?

313
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,200
Tried and true,
or new and exciting?

314
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,839
Obviously, she chose the steak,

315
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,400
which is why we got that kiss
in front of a Subway franchise.

316
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,920
It's art and it's cinema
and it's sandwiches.

317
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,359
The point is, Subway advertises
a ridiculous amount,

318
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,160
and its franchisees benefit
from that brand-building.

319
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,200
But in return, Subway expects
them to work very hard.

320
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,200
Something made painfully clear
in this video,

321
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:58,480
created by a regional office, which
takes a bit of a turn halfway through.

322
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,920
When you buy a franchise,
you enter into a family,

323
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,480
the Subway family.

324
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:05,799
We must own
what is ours to own.

325
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,000
We must lead
what is ours to lead.

326
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:12,559
Whether you sell sandwiches,
develop stores, or evaluate operations,

327
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,519
we must do our part
to the best of our ability.

328
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,400
Why? Because in this family,
people matter,

329
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,400
so we don't let people down
by being lazy.

330
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,519
We don't complain
about each other's work.

331
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:27,200
We don't feel sorry for ourselves,
and we certainly don't give up.

332
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,680
My God, it's a sandwich cult.

333
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,240
And it's one
that should probably think twice

334
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,880
about threatening their so-called
family members for being lazy

335
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,000
when they couldn't even put in the
effort to proof-read their own copy,

336
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:43,359
because this is not how you spell buy
as in "to buy a franchise",

337
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,359
and they've left out the word "to"
in this sentence.

338
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,240
But to whoever made that video,
don't worry.

339
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:50,440
After all,
it's only two little mistakes,

340
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:53,759
there's no need
to fell sorry for yourself.

341
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:59,640
There is only so much a franchise owner
can do to increase their earnings,

342
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,799
as they are largely at the mercy of
decisions their parent company makes.

343
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,400
So, if Subway decides to change
the menu or redesign the stores,

344
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,119
franchisees may be
on the hook for those costs.

345
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,119
Also, if the company announces
a promotion or a discount,

346
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,119
stores may have to go along with it,
even if it is a money-loser for them.

347
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,680
And it gets even worse.

348
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:20,359
Because those already
ridiculously tight margins

349
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,759
have been exacerbated by Subway's
longtime obsession with expansion.

350
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:28,039
For decades, franchisees
have complained about Subway

351
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:32,279
allowing locations to open near each
other and cannibalizing their business.

352
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:35,000
Here is the head
of a franchisee association

353
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:37,440
discussing the problem
back in the '90s.

354
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,960
What they tell you
when you buy that franchise is,

355
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,079
"Don't worry, we wouldn't put
another franchise too close to you.

356
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,440
Why would we do that? Why would
we want to hurt you like that?

357
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:47,960
You're one of our partners."

358
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:51,279
Reality is, they're going
to do whatever they can do

359
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,359
that's not written in black
and white, and they do it.

360
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,160
Okay, first: that is some
very dramatic camerawork.

361
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,319
But also,
Power Bangs is completely right there.

362
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,400
In fact, to this day,
Subway franchisees are told that

363
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,799
"You will not receive
an exclusive territory,"

364
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,400
and their contract states,

365
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,680
"We and our affiliates have
unlimited rights to compete with you."

366
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,519
A Subway could open right next
to yours and cut your sales in half.

367
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:18,880
And none of this really
affects Subway corporate.

368
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,279
They still get their royalty fees
on any sale,

369
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,400
plus a $15,000 franchise fee
for every new store that's opened.

370
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,319
That is why these stores
are fucking everywhere.

371
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,440
There are literally 10 Subways
in a one-mile radius

372
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:35,079
of where I'm sitting right now.

373
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,839
You could go to all 10 stores,
order a foot long at each,

374
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,000
and be back here
in less than an hour.

375
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,200
And the reason I know that is,
I did that, and frankly,

376
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,400
I'm instantly regretting
that decision.

377
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,519
Because now this entire studio
is about to smell like a Subway,

378
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:54,559
which as we all know is the exact smell
of, "What if bread could fart?"

379
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,319
And all of this was by design.

380
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,400
Fred DeLuca even once attempted
to convince a journalist

381
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,079
that more Subway locations
raises everyone's revenues

382
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,400
by referencing a graph
his 24-year-old son made,

383
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,680
which an economist
later reviewed, saying,

384
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:14,599
"In my view,
this tells us absolutely nothing.

385
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,480
If this is true then why not have
15 Subways on the same block?

386
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,519
Wouldn't they all be doing splendidly?
The answer is obviously not."

387
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,119
And that is a lot of sass
coming from an economist.

388
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,599
"The answer is obviously not,"

389
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:33,359
is much like Subway's spicy Italian
sub: not actually spicy in the least,

390
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,720
but given the source,
about as spicy as you're gonna get.

391
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,440
And encroaching
on their own territory

392
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,279
isn't the only way
Subway has angered franchisees.

393
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:45,119
Because their corporate structure
has long involved something called

394
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,000
"business development agents".

395
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:50,079
These are individuals,
often franchise owners themselves,

396
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,880
who control a certain area,

397
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,880
and are tasked with finding and
approving new people to open stores,

398
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,319
getting a cut of royalties
for doing that.

399
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,480
They're also in charge of overseeing
inspections of stores in their area.

400
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,480
And for many years,
franchisees have complained about

401
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,759
development agents being exceptionally
harsh with those inspections,

402
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:12,319
with one saying he was once marked up
for "slicing his vegetables

403
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,160
in a choppy' manner.

404
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,759
Which seems pretty petty.
How else would you do it?

405
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,759
And there's an incentive for
development agents to be overly harsh,

406
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:24,200
because if a store
gets multiple violations,

407
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:27,039
that franchisee's agreement
can be terminated,

408
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,880
and the store can be re-sold,

409
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,160
sometimes to the business
development agent themselves,

410
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,160
at a discounted price.

411
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,079
One former inspector even described
a development agent

412
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,000
telling her the exact store owners
that he wanted to fail, adding,

413
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:43,240
"I was kind of his hit man".

414
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,759
Normal sandwich stuff.

415
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:50,400
Subway insists
it's transitioning away

416
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,400
from using
development agents in the U.S.

417
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,119
and from having them
be the ones overseeing inspections.

418
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,799
But even so,
you might well be wondering,

419
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,000
given everything you've seen so far,

420
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,480
"Why on earth would anyone
want to open a Subway,

421
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:07,759
when it has some of the highest
royalties, some of the lowest sales,

422
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:11,319
and a new store could conceivably
open right next door to you?"

423
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,319
Potential owners often don't fully
know what they're signing up for.

424
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,559
Here is one Subway franchisee
inadvertently making this point.

425
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:23,880
I bought my original store from a guy
who was involved with Subway,

426
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,000
had been involved
for about five years before me.

427
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:32,839
And that store, little did I know, was
the lowest volume store in the market.

428
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:36,039
When I went to my first owners'
meeting, him and his buddy said,

429
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:39,839
"Hey, Lollipop," and I said,
"Why are they calling me Lollipop?"

430
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,400
And they said, "We needed
a sucker to buy Columbus,"

431
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,119
which was the Subway, right?

432
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,920
Out of 91 stores in the market,
it was 91st.

433
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,519
Yeah, that's not great, is it?

434
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:52,960
Ideally you would have that kind
of information before you invested.

435
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,079
It's hard to tell
how successful a Subway is

436
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,359
just from looking at it,
especially because, from the outside,

437
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,599
they all look like the worst one.

438
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,359
Currently, there is no easy way
to find out what you might earn

439
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,160
before you open a new Subway,
for two reasons.

440
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,240
First, the company won't tell you.
Generally, when it comes to franchises,

441
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,720
the FTC requires
that you are provided

442
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,279
with what's called
a franchise disclosure document,

443
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:19,720
giving you important information
before you invest.

444
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,720
But it doesn't require companies

445
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:25,039
to include any details
about how stores do financially.

446
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:28,920
Now, some companies
do provide this, but it's voluntary.

447
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,759
Firehouse Subs has 17 pages
dedicated to financial performance,

448
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:37,759
Burger King's includes 11 pages,
but Subway has just two paragraphs

449
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:40,759
in which they say,
"We do not make any representations

450
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:43,400
about a franchisee's future
financial performance,"

451
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,319
or "the past financial performance
of franchised outlets."

452
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,200
Instead, Fred DeLuca encouraged
potential owners to simply do this.

453
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,920
We really want people
to go find out from other franchisees.

454
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,599
Rather than relying
on what we might tell you,

455
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,519
it's much better experience
to talk to 10, 20 franchisees.

456
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,359
Some will be doing very well,
some won't do very well,

457
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,279
and you can then size
up the business.

458
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,880
Yeah, or you could
just tell them

459
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,359
instead of making them
go to 20 different Subway stores.

460
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,960
Luckily for them, you can find 20
of them on any one block in America,

461
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:22,359
but it's really
the principle of the matter here.

462
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,079
But getting accurate info
can be very hard to do.

463
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,279
For starters, some franchisees
may be reluctant to speak,

464
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,839
because, a few years ago,

465
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,440
Subway added an aggressive non-
disparagement clause in their contract.

466
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:35,319
And while it's true
that there is now a carve-out

467
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,960
saying you're not prohibited
from sharing information in good faith

468
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,200
with any prospective franchisees,

469
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:42,200
as one of them told Congress
a few years ago,

470
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:45,640
many are reluctant to trust someone
calling and asking questions,

471
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,519
and for obvious reasons.

472
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,799
So, people always talk about doing
due diligence in the industry

473
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,359
before they buy a franchise.

474
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,079
One of those parts of the due diligence
is calling existing owners.

475
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,279
Most franchise agreements have
that non-disparagement clause in it.

476
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:04,440
I can tell you,
if I'm in one of my stores

477
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:07,519
and somebody calls me
and starts asking questions,

478
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,079
and I have a negative experience,
am I going to really say so?

479
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,920
I don't know
who's on the other end of the line.

480
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,279
Exactly. You have no idea
who might be calling.

481
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:20,039
It's all the more reason why you
should never answer your phone.

482
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:23,519
Calling people is for divorcees
and serial killers.

483
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,559
I haven't answered
my phone in 10 years now.

484
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,559
Either text me or forget me.

485
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,960
And look, lots of the problems
you've seen tonight

486
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,599
exist in some form
with almost all franchises.

487
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,599
But Subway in particular
seems like the absolute worst.

488
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,839
For years, their store owners have
begged them to be less restrictive,

489
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,640
with some even releasing
that open letter last year,

490
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,960
complaining about many of the things
that we've mentioned tonight,

491
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,039
and alleging
whenever they've spoken out

492
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:50,880
about any of these issues
to the media,

493
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,319
they've been silenced by cease and
desist letters, biased arbitrations,

494
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,680
and forced
non-disclosure agreements.

495
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:00,799
Rather than listening to that, Subway's
made things even worse for them.

496
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,200
They recently updated their contract
for new and renewing franchisees,

497
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:07,599
which, among other things,
expands the non-disparagement clause

498
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,880
to include "subjecting
the Subway brand to ridicule."

499
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,480
Which, come on Subway,

500
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:17,920
you are the one who made your
new logo two arrows 69ing each other.

501
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,640
The call is coming
from inside the house here.

502
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,799
It is frankly no wonder
one restaurant industry expert said,

503
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,279
"No one in their right mind
would sign the new agreement".

504
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,279
So what can we do here?

505
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:36,160
I know that your instinct might be to
now never go to your local Subway.

506
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,680
It may have been your instinct
before this segment began,

507
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:40,880
and honestly,
it remains a good one.

508
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,119
But it's worth remembering, some have
spent their life savings on these stores,

509
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,119
believing the promise
they could be their own boss,

510
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,400
and are stuck in a business model
that was stacked against them.

511
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,440
And to prevent
that happening to anyone else,

512
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:59,119
there are things we should be doing
to better regulate all franchises.

513
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,559
The FTC should tighten up
their rules on them,

514
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,559
and make disclosing
financial performance mandatory.

515
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,319
That would force companies
to give a much fuller picture

516
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,279
to any potential investors
of what they are getting into.

517
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:13,759
But until that happens,
or Subway specifically decides

518
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:16,480
to present a more accurate picture
of how they operate,

519
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,599
maybe we can tell their story for them,
through their favorite medium.

520
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,920
I'm talking, of course,
about Korean sandwich dramas.

521
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,759
Please, take a look!

522
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,319
They say it happens
when you least expect it.

523
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,880
But then, there he was.
The answer to my appetite.

524
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:44,240
It started with an extra meatball.

525
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:54,440
One bite and I was hooked.

526
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,519
It's perfect.

527
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:02,039
You're perfect.

528
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,839
Before I knew it,
I was in love.

529
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,720
Every day with him
was an adventure.

530
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:27,319
Every sandwich,
a chance to connect.

531
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,559
We were growing so close.

532
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,160
His touch was electrifying.

533
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:46,039
But then something changed.

534
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:49,960
Your lettuce is too green.

535
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,480
One more strike
and you're finished for real.

536
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,359
Who's that?

537
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:02,440
He's my development agent.
He sucks.

538
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:06,880
Also, he got me to sign an incredibly
exploitative contract.

539
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,559
From that moment on,
things weren't the same.

540
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,759
No extra meatball?

541
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,160
I can't.
I'm barely making a profit.

542
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,759
My stomach was empty
and so was my heart.

543
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,279
I have great news!

544
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,079
We're opening another Subway
close to here.

545
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,400
How close?

546
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,559
Right over there.

547
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,359
I'm sorry.

548
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:59,799
What?
What are you going to do?

549
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,920
He was different.

550
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:08,880
New.

551
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,519
Exciting.

552
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,559
This contract
says we can do this!

553
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,319
It was wrong,
but it tasted so right.

554
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:45,000
I was torn,
caught between two sandwich artists.

555
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:54,279
Until I realized the answer
was in front of me all along.

556
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,599
Wait!

557
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,400
- What is it?
- I love meatballs.

558
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,359
- What?
- I love extra meatballs.

559
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,240
Look!

560
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,000
Has that been in your pocket
all day?

561
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:29,960
I love you.

562
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,119
And I love Spicy Marinaras
with extra meatballs.

563
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,079
I love Spicy Marinaras
with extra meatballs!

564
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,839
And you saw that.

565
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,920
Don't!

566
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,559
Why?

567
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:50,960
We're not even sure
if the meat in those is real.

568
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,440
Is this real?

569
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,839
The tuna tastes like shit.

570
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:25,200
Like an asshole.

571
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,880
That's our show.
Thanks so much for watching!

572
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,440
We're off next week.
Good night!
