LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,679
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight"!
I'm John Oliver,

3
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:38,159
Thank you so much for joining us.
It has been another busy week.

4
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,600
Russia is still brutalizing Ukraine,
Amazon workers in the U.S.

5
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:44,039
successfully voted
to unionize for the first time,

6
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,280
and at the Oscars, this happened,

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,920
a moment that has since spawned
thousands of terrible takes,

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,679
with this one maybe being
the one that we needed the least.

9
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,799
The question I've been getting is,
Will Smith and Chris Rock.

10
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,119
It was unfortunate,
I think Will was wrong.

11
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,719
I understood the feeling.

12
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,239
Nope. Not you, O.J. Not you.
No one wants to hear from you on this,

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,599
especially when you seem
to be coming live

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,959
from the Covid patio
of a Senor Frogs.

15
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,239
You can just sit this one out.

16
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:18,480
Think of this situation like a rowdy
bachelorette ordering a mimosa:

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,840
we want as little juice involved here
as humanly possible.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,599
But let's move on to Washington, where
Republicans had a dramatic week,

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,079
thanks to Madison Cawthorn,

20
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,079
the freshman congressman
from North Carolina,

21
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,640
and the fallout from this interview.

22
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,480
I look at all these people,
a lot of them that I,

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,799
I've looked up to through my life,
I've always paid attention to politics.

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,879
Guys that, then all of a sudden
you get invited to...

25
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:42,120
"We're going to a sexual get-together
at one of our homes, you should come."

26
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:45,159
And I'm like, "What did you
just ask me to come to?"

27
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,319
And you realize they're asking you
to come to an orgy.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,959
Or the fact that, you know,
they're some of the people

29
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,400
that are leading on the movement to try
and remove addiction in our country,

30
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,599
and then you watch them do, a key
bump of cocaine in front of you.

31
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,319
And it's like, this is wild.

32
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,560
No one uses the phrase "key bump"
without knowing exactly what it means,

33
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,359
so it feels like you're already
telling on yourself a little there.

34
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,439
Also, I'm pretty sure
that people having coke-fueled orgies

35
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,759
don't call them
"sexual get-togethers."

36
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,800
A "sexual get-together"
sounds like a sex toy party

37
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,960
at your friend Brenda's
friend Shenae's house,

38
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,120
where you realize halfway through that
the whole thing's a pyramid scheme.

39
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,120
"No, I don't want to sample
any more raspberry nipple cream.

40
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:27,759
This is a scam, and I'm going home.
I got a babysitter for this!"

41
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,840
Also, and this really isn't the point,
but what is this podcast?

42
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,919
That's rhetorical,
I don't care and won't learn.

43
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,000
I think that it's weird
that the only two clues we have

44
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,560
are a "Braveheart" poster

45
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,000
and what appears to be
a rag doll of Post Malone.

46
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,879
Cawthorn's remarks prompted
stern rebukes from his colleagues,

47
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,879
with House Minority Leader
Kevin McCarthy saying,

48
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,960
"There is no evidence
behind his statements,"

49
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,039
"he's lost my trust, and he's going
to have to earn it back."

50
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,599
And if that truly was the moment
when Cawthorn lost McCarthy's trust,

51
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,800
then let's take a minute on that.

52
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:00,639
Because Cawthorn
has said a lot of objectionable things.

53
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,840
He's urged people

54
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,280
to "lightly threaten" members
of Congress ahead of January 6th,

55
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,599
suggested Biden's
door-to-door vaccine strategy

56
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,080
could be used
to "take people's guns and Bibles,"

57
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:11,439
and just recently called Zelensky
a thug.

58
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,199
He also offered this incredible piece
of parenting advice just last year.

59
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:18,919
They're trying to demasculate
the young men in this country

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,560
because they don't want people
who are going to stand up.

61
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,439
And so, I'm telling you,
all of you moms here,

62
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,719
the people who I said were
the most vicious in our movement,

63
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:30,680
if you are raising a young man,
please raise them to be a monster.

64
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,280
Raise...

65
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,840
Don't worry, Madison.

66
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:40,400
I'm sure the moms who responded there
with front-row BeyoncÃ© ticket energy

67
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,080
have already struck
the exact right balance of bigotry,

68
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,360
denial of affection,
and casual permission of violence

69
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,159
that'll have their sons on the
front page of a terrible news story.

70
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,080
The fact is, though,

71
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:55,000
Cawthorn's record with the truth
has always been unrelentingly bad.

72
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,400
He implied the car crash
that left him partially paralyzed

73
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:00,240
derailed his plans
to attend the U.S. Naval Academy,

74
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,919
even though his application had already
been rejected before the crash.

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,120
He frequently claimed
to be training for the Paralympics,

76
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:09,240
which was news to actual Paralympians
like Amanda McGrory,

77
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:12,039
who pointed out he's not even in the
official registry for Paralympians,

78
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,000
which he would have to be
in order to compete, adding:

79
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,199
"It's like a kid saying
they want to play in the NBA

80
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,759
when they're on their fourth-grade
basketball team."

81
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,480
And quick side note here:

82
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,839
Cawthorn often makes reference
to his disability,

83
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,160
or finds ways to center it.

84
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,319
Like when he made a point of standing
for the flag at the RNC.

85
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,800
That is something that especially
irritates some disability advocates,

86
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,680
who feels it plays
into the hands of societal ableism,

87
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,560
the cultural desire to see people
with disabilities only as inspirational,

88
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,360
when, obviously,
they are a broad group of people

89
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,480
who include everyone from incredible
athletes like Amanda McGrory,

90
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,639
to douchey frat bros
lying their way to power.

91
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,040
It turns out, being a shitty person,
unlike so much of our society,

92
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,680
is one of the few things that
is actually accessible for everyone.

93
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,279
But Cawthorn was also the subject
of a scathing public letter

94
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,319
signed by more than 150 of his former
college classmates,

95
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:08,959
alleging he engaged in "sexually
predatory behavior" while in college.

96
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,959
And while on one hand,
he denies those claims,

97
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,600
on the other hand, there was
this incredible moment in a debate.

98
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:18,560
If I have a daughter,
I want her to grow up in a world

99
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,439
where people will have
to ask permission to touch her.

100
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:25,160
It would have made my high school
experience much less awkward

101
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,399
if I knew that was a question
that could generally be asked.

102
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,759
If I have a son, I want him to grow up
in a world where he's not accused

103
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,720
of being a sexual predator
because he wants to kiss a girl.

104
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:41,040
The good news is,
that's already half true.

105
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:44,639
No one tells boys they're sexual
predators for wanting to kiss girls.

106
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,519
How are we doing on the other part?
I don't know, Madison.

107
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,000
Let's ask anyone
who went to college with you.

108
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,680
The point is, none of what happened
with Cawthorn this week

109
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,920
should be remotely surprising
to anyone.

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,920
Especially given that
when he ran for office,

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,759
this was one of his actual ads.

112
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,519
Did you hear?
My opponent is a simp.

113
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,600
He endorsed Nancy Pelosi right here
in western North Carolina.

114
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,639
I won't endorse Nancy Pelosi.
I'll make her life a living hell.

115
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,399
I believe you can run your life
better than I can.

116
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,199
Better than any socialist
simp Congress can.

117
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm Madison Cawthorn.
I'm not a socialist.

118
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:25,360
I'm not a simp. I am your weapon.
Send me to Congress to fight for you.

119
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:29,199
Okay, I don't know
how many times the word "simp"

120
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,439
should appear in a campaign ad,
but I don't think it's three.

121
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,279
And now I've said it out loud,
more than zero is clearly too many.

122
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,680
And for the record,
since his election,

123
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,959
Cawthorn has shown much less interest
in "fighting for his constituents"

124
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,040
than in shameless self-promotion,
reportedly telling colleagues

125
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,560
he'd built his staff around comms
rather than legislation.

126
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,279
Which absolutely makes sense.

127
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,560
Because this guy loves posting
shots of himself on Instagram,

128
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,800
whether he's fishing,
smoking cigars,

129
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,759
or, in a post that's now been deleted,
visiting Hitler's vacation house,

130
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,279
known as the "Eagle's Nest",

131
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,560
in which his caption
refers to Hitler as "the Fuhrer"

132
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,920
and says the site had been
on his bucket list for a while

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,759
and "did not disappoint."

134
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,920
I know it's not the worst thing, but
there is also this photo, captioned,

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,040
"Getting crazy with some apple cobbler
made right over the smoke."

136
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,279
And I don't know what that is,
but it is definitely not a cobbler.

137
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,920
It doesn't have a biscuit
or a pie dough topping.

138
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,800
It's not a buckle, because I don't see
a cake base with a streusel topping.

139
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,279
If he was throwing it on a stovetop,
he could try and call it a grunt,

140
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,519
but it just isn't one.

141
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,639
It's not an apple brown betty,
it's not a crisp,

142
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,600
and if you're calling that a sonker,
you're dead fucking wrong, my friend.

143
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,160
It basically looks like someone grated
a medium-sized baby into a skillet.

144
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,959
That's nothing.
That's fucking nothing, Madison.

145
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,959
Words. Mean. Things.

146
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,399
But the absolute masterpiece
of his Instagram has got to be this.

147
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah. He appears to be punching
a tree because it looks weak.

148
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:04,399
It's like somebody
told the story of George Washington

149
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,480
chopping down the cherry tree to a dog,
then that dog told Madison Cawthorn.

150
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,480
It is one of the stupidest things
I've ever seen in my entire life.

151
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,839
If, when I die,
I meet God, and God says:

152
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,759
"Did you see that stupid thing?"

153
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,240
I'll know exactly
what God is talking about.

154
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,439
And all of this is really to say,

155
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:26,600
Kevin McCarthy, this is the guy
that surprised you this week?

156
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:31,360
This predatory, conspiratorial,
inexplicably hostile to trees guy?

157
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,399
Your party has supported
and enabled him this whole time.

158
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,960
And the tactics
he uses are pretty much in line

159
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,360
with Republicans' entire MO
right now.

160
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,120
Or to put this in terms
Madison Cawthorn would understand,

161
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,039
looks to me like you raised a monster,
and now it's your fucking problem.

162
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,639
And now, this!

163
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,399
And Now...

164
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,559
Local News Has an Urgent Warning
About Season Two of "Bridgerton".

165
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,000
Less fun and less sex.

166
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,679
That's apparently what season two
of "Bridgerton" is all about.

167
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:04,399
And if you're going in expecting
this season

168
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:09,039
some of the stuff you got last season,
you're not going to get it.

169
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,639
Some of that spice? Okay.

170
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,320
I'm not saying
that I'm not enjoying it.

171
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,080
But last season was like,
up here with the action.

172
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,919
- It is not as steamy as the first.
- Nuts.

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,559
It's not as hot and heavy.
You're going to get the drama.

174
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,279
You're watching Bridgerton
for sex?

175
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,759
The aesthetic vision it's beautiful.
Some of the storylines were really cool.

176
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,240
- I just was expecting...
- More!

177
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:37,799
There's less bumping uglies,
you know what I mean?

178
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:41,440
It's just...
They're just playing polo and things.

179
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,759
There's only three minutes
of raunchy moments in this new season,

180
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,840
and I don't know what that's
compared to with last season,

181
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,679
but you remember, he was
unbuttoning, unzipping, unlacing...

182
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:52,519
- But it's also, it's nice.
- Yeah. It's okay.

183
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,120
- Yeah, no, it's good.
- Okay.

184
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,120
- It's just not...
- Just not great.

185
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,679
- No, it's just not that...
- The spice.

186
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,879
You know what I mean!

187
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:09,480
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns trucks.

188
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:13,440
Everybody loves them, from kids
who like the fact they go honk honk,

189
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,480
to producers of reality shows,

190
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:18,399
who it seems cannot get enough
of trucks and their drivers.

191
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,440
Across America giant trucks with cargos
worth millions vanish into thin air.

192
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,759
"Big Rig Bounty Hunters".

193
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,440
There's no better way to learn this job
than actually doing it.

194
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,480
"Highway Through Hell." All new.

195
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,360
"Shipping Wars." A new series.

196
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,639
"World's Toughest Trucker."
All new series.

197
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,720
"Mud Mountain Haulers."
New series.

198
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:37,080
IT'S A JOB

199
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,159
TO DIE FOR

200
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,840
"Ice Road Truckers".
Begins Sunday, June 17th, at 10:00.

201
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,759
People like their reality trucker shows
the same way I like my coffee:

202
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,159
full of ice, and intense
enough to make me shit myself.

203
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,000
But trucks are not
just a staple of reality TV,

204
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,000
they're a vital part
of our economy,

205
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,320
carrying 70% of the tonnage
that moves around America.

206
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,960
And the drivers involved know
how much this country relies on them.

207
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:13,120
If these trucks were shut down,
for one week,

208
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,159
this country would be in...

209
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,679
- Three days.
- Three days? Three days.

210
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,679
This country would be...

211
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,840
They'd shut the country down.

212
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:28,240
'Cause nothing you eat,
wear, drink, drive,

213
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,519
doesn't move on a truck.

214
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,279
It's pretty upsetting to realize that,
without trucks, after just a week...

215
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,639
- Three days!
- Sorry, three days...

216
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,519
Every produce department in America
would go from "fully-stocked market"

217
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,639
to "all-you-can-eat raccoon buffet."

218
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,159
So, it's no wonder
trucking's a huge industry,

219
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,720
with more than 3,5 million people
in America working as drivers,

220
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:55,440
from port truckers who bring goods
off ships to rail yards and warehouses,

221
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,639
to long-haul truckers
who move them across the country,

222
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,840
to last mile drivers,
who take care of local delivery.

223
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,600
And yet,
you've probably heard recently,

224
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,360
the whole industry
is facing a massive problem.

225
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,320
We're going to turn now to a nationwide
shortage of truck drivers.

226
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,639
...major truck driver shortage
straining the already stretched chain,

227
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,399
and there doesn't seem to be
an end in sight.

228
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,360
Empty store shelves signal
a supply chain in crisis,

229
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:22,320
exacerbated by a shortage
of truck drivers.

230
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,960
Yeah, that doesn't sound good,
does it?

231
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:27,639
The only time I'm actively
rooting for a supply chain crisis

232
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,799
is whenever a container ship
gets stuck in the Suez Canal.

233
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,600
I don't care if the entire
global economy collapses,

234
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,000
I just love to see
that big rectangle stuck.

235
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:39,519
The point is,
trucking companies have been quick

236
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,799
to claim they're suffering
a shortage of drivers.

237
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:43,080
They've been saying
that for a while now.

238
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,519
But the truth is,
their actual problem

239
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,200
is less a problem of driver shortage,
and more of driver retention.

240
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:52,720
Because hundreds of thousands of
people become truck drivers every year,

241
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:55,600
but hundreds of thousands also quit.

242
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:59,440
Job turnover for truckers averages
over 100 percent,

243
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,399
and at some companies,
it's as high as 300 percent,

244
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,200
meaning they're hiring three people for
a single job over the course of a year.

245
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,360
And when a field this important has
a level of job satisfaction that low,

246
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,919
it sure seems
like there is a huge problem.

247
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,759
So tonight,
let's examine the trucking industry:

248
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,360
how drivers make a living,
how they often don't,

249
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,519
and how companies benefit
from the whole miserable system.

250
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,480
And the first thing to know is,
it wasn't always like this.

251
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,799
In the 1970s, truck driving
was a solid middle-class profession,

252
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:33,120
with trucker culture even becoming
trendy, through songs like "Convoy,"

253
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,679
movies like
"Every Which Way but Loose,"

254
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,000
and TV shows
like "BJ and the Bear,"

255
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,360
about a trucker
and his chimpanzee friend.

256
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,720
And if you're thinking
that that show sounds weird,

257
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:44,399
you don't know the half of it.

258
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,840
BJ was a happy-go-lucky trucker
who would haul anything for a price.

259
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:51,200
You're the guy, aren't you?
The guy who hauls anything anywhere

260
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,480
for a buck and a half a mile,
no questions asked?

261
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,639
But this time,

262
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,879
his cargo was 11 young women
escaping from a white slavery gang.

263
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,080
Roadblocks mean nothing
to BJ McKay,

264
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:02,759
an ex-POW
and helicopter pilot from Vietnam.

265
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:08,240
Claude Akins and Betty Finder
star in "BJ and the Bear"!

266
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,960
Yes! The true
golden age of television right there.

267
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:17,360
This medium peaked in 1979 and we will
never see the mountaintop again.

268
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,000
That promo started
with a driver living with a chimpanzee

269
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,159
and it escalated so fast, Casey Kasem
didn't have time to mention the chimp.

270
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:30,000
Where did it come from?
Was the chimp also in Vietnam?

271
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,000
Why is it called Bear?
Who cares? There's no time!

272
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,320
It seems we're shooting guns
from helicopters

273
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,679
at other helicopters now, those details
are going to have to wait.

274
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:41,080
Every year, the Emmys
should release a statement saying,

275
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,159
"All awards go to 'BJ and the Bear,'
again. Try harder next year, TV."

276
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:49,879
But the truth is, truck driving
was genuinely a decent job.

277
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,519
But that began to change in 1980,

278
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,840
when Jimmy Carter
signed the Motor Carrier Act,

279
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:58,600
deregulating the market in an attempt
to lower prices for consumers.

280
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,679
That set off a "race to the bottom

281
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,960
in cutting wages"
among trucking companies.

282
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:06,799
40 years later, the "base compensation
for long-haul truck drivers

283
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,720
is estimated to be down
50 percent in real terms."

284
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,279
And there are three key problems
with the way the industry's

285
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,159
currently set up
that we're going to look at tonight.

286
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,399
The first is how they are paid.

287
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,360
Because most long-haul drivers
are paid by the mile, not by the hour.

288
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,080
Raising obvious questions,

289
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,320
like, well, what about when
trucks are waiting to load,

290
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,000
unload, and reload?

291
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,080
Do they really not get paid for that?
And for the most part, they don't.

292
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,919
This is a huge sticking point
for truck drivers.

293
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,279
If you ever go on trucker
YouTube or TikTok,

294
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,200
which you absolutely should,
you will see videos like these.

295
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,159
Why do we have to sit in a dock
for three hours,

296
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,440
or three and a half hours
up to this point?

297
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,679
I've been in the shipper for...

298
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:55,960
19 hours.

299
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:01,080
Not many other jobs where you can
just be on the job and not get paid.

300
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:04,159
You're sitting over there judging me.
I don't have a reload, we can't move.

301
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,000
It's not me!
It's not me, it's dispatch!

302
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,279
I can't help that the dispatcher
is slow as shit!

303
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,039
You call and tell him,
I ain't, you ain't...

304
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,200
I don't give a damn if you ain't got
no thumbs, you call and tell him.

305
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:21,399
Yeah, it's a major problem,
the waiting time,

306
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,720
that is, not the fact that dogs don't
have thumbs and can't use a phone.

307
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,320
That is probably a good thing.
Because if they could do that,

308
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:29,600
they would literally never stop
texting you shit like,

309
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:31,399
"Fuck, I just saw a squirrel!"

310
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,399
and, "Miss you, love you, fuck,
just saw the squirrel again!"

311
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,159
And while
this isn't a new problem,

312
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,440
long waits at loading docks have
jumped significantly in recent years.

313
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,039
If you are paid per mile
and lose half your workday waiting,

314
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,120
you are incentivized to try and make up
for that time once you're on the road.

315
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,519
Which does make sense,
doesn't it?

316
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,320
If I only got paid
per joke about AT&T,

317
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:57,120
I'd try and cram in as many
AT&T jokes as possible.

318
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,799
I'd be dropping them
like AT&T drops calls.

319
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:02,759
Because the more Johnny burns,
the more Johnny earns.

320
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,519
But this can be a real safety problem
for all of us.

321
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,480
5,000 people each year are killed
in crashes involving large trucks.

322
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,279
The government has tried to address
safety concerns by mandating breaks

323
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,960
and limiting the number of hours
truckers can be on the road.

324
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,319
They even require electronic
monitoring devices like this one

325
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,519
that log when the truck is moving
to ensure compliance.

326
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,160
But many drivers find that frustrating
in a different way,

327
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,039
because it limits their agency
over how and when they can drive.

328
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:35,680
We're not computers,
we don't have an off button.

329
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:40,039
The thing this does do, is it forces
you to get up and go if you're tired.

330
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,240
It forces you to get up
and go if you don't feel good.

331
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,680
And it's not about running
24 hours a day,

332
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,200
it's about making a common sense
decision on how you feel,

333
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:52,920
how the road conditions are, whether or
not you want to run through rush hour.

334
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,079
There are some jobs you can do
if you don't feel good.

335
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,359
Like this one for instance.
I feel like shit all the time.

336
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,960
Look at me.
But it doesn't really matter, does it,

337
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,680
because this desk isn't moving
towards you at 80 miles an hour,

338
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:10,880
so the consequences of my poor
job performance are not likely to kill.

339
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,240
And when these rigid rules bump up
against unpredictable work hours,

340
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,920
drivers are put
in an impossible position.

341
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,400
Take this driver,

342
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,000
whose company made him take
his 10-hour break during the day,

343
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:25,440
when he couldn't sleep, and then found
himself driving exhausted at night.

344
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,480
And when he called his dispatcher
to say that he felt unsafe to drive,

345
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,519
just watch how badly
the call went.

346
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,079
Man, we got a bit of a problem.

347
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,440
I'm starting to fall asleep going
down the road here.

348
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,920
But get a load of this,
the K&B dispatchers,

349
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,680
instead of telling him
to just get some rest,

350
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,319
hot potato Abe
from one dispatcher to another,

351
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,880
each of them with the same advice.

352
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,920
Get some coffee
'cause we don't have a choice on this.

353
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,759
Get a cup of coffee,
walk around the truck, do something.

354
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,680
I already did that earlier, man.

355
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,079
Let's get out and get some fresh air.
What is it, about 10 degrees outside?

356
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:01,839
- Yep.
- That'll wake you right up.

357
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,599
I'm telling you, I'm not safe
to drive at the moment.

358
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,880
Okay, well then, here's the deal,
we don't have a choice on this.

359
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,039
That's not how we work here
at K&B.

360
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,319
I say I'm not gonna hurt anybody
out here on the road.

361
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,279
You don't need to jump to that.

362
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:15,319
That's dramatic...
I don't need this morning!

363
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,880
"I don't need that this morning?"
That is a hell of a statement.

364
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,240
"Get out of here with that dramatic
shit until at least 1:00 PM."

365
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:25,720
It's like the mug says,
"Don't confront me with the potentially

366
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,799
lethal consequences
of my reckless decision-making

367
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,720
until after I've had my coffee."

368
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:33,359
So, drivers end up getting squeezed
between regulations

369
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,599
and the companies
that they drive for...

370
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,720
At no point in the process are their
feelings or needs taken into account.

371
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:42,680
And that is not the only way
that they get squeezed here.

372
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:45,240
Because the second
exploitative quirk of this industry

373
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:49,039
concerns the relationship between
drivers and trucking companies.

374
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,480
Many carriers classify drivers
not as employees,

375
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,359
but as independent contractors.

376
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,119
And while there are some
to whom that label truly applies,

377
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,599
those who genuinely have the freedom
to choose between different loads

378
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,680
and haul for whomever they want,

379
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:06,920
the fact is, many companies
misclassify drivers as independent

380
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:08,799
who work exclusively for them,

381
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:11,960
and whose day-to-day lives
they fundamentally control.

382
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:14,440
And there are obvious reasons
for companies to do this,

383
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:15,960
as this trucker explains.

384
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:18,359
I am not classified
as an employee.

385
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,400
I am classified
as an independent contractor,

386
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:25,440
but I have very little control over
the success or failure of my company.

387
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,319
Despite his so-called independence,
Prior works exclusively for Shippers,

388
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,279
which doles out his daily routes.

389
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,160
He's seen his paychecks dwindle

390
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,480
and has none of the protections
he would get as an employee.

391
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,279
Long as we're independent contractors,
they don't have to cover benefits,

392
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:45,319
they don't have to cover sick days,
bereavement, leave time, holiday pay.

393
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:48,200
It just saves the company money.

394
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,279
Yeah, of course
this is attractive for companies.

395
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,960
They don't even have to give you
time off when a family member dies.

396
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,720
Unless your nana's wake is being held
in front of the diesel pump at a Wawa,

397
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:01,240
you're probably
not going to be able to attend.

398
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,880
And it actually exempts them from
even more than what he just said there.

399
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,359
Because it also allows companies
to avoid paying payroll taxes,

400
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,640
workers' comp,
and unemployment insurance,

401
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,759
as well as the minimum wage.

402
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:14,160
And if that wasn't enough,
being an independent contractor

403
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,240
means all the costs and risks of truck
ownership get pushed onto the driver.

404
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,200
Watch as this former trucker

405
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:23,759
explains exactly what was left
of her household earnings

406
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,119
once she and her husband
had accounted for all their costs.

407
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:30,480
We made $150,000, right,
in a year.

408
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:33,359
That sounds great, right?
That's, like, good money.

409
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:38,039
We paid $100,000 in fuel, okay?

410
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:40,640
So, right there,
now I made $50,000.

411
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,720
But I didn't really, because you get
an oil change every month.

412
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:45,920
$300 a month.

413
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,160
You have to do all the maintenance.
We had a motor blow out, right?

414
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,759
$13,000.

415
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,119
Right? I know, I choke up a little
just thinking about it,

416
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,559
because it was 13,000,
and we were off work for two weeks.

417
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,039
So, by the end of the year,
with that 150,000,

418
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:08,240
by the end of the year,
we'd made about $22,000.

419
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,200
Yeah. And look, I am no CPA,
despite the face, glasses,

420
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,240
and insatiable horniness for numbers
that strongly implies otherwise,

421
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:20,000
but that seems
like a pretty shitty bottom line.

422
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:23,960
While most of the drivers that you've
seen so far have been in long-haul,

423
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:26,160
this "independent contractor" problem

424
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,799
very much applies to those at either
end of the shipping process, too,

425
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,039
like port truckers,

426
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:34,880
where one study estimated
two-thirds of them are misclassified,

427
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,119
and also, last mile drivers...

428
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,440
those are the people who drive box
trucks or sprinter vans

429
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:42,640
to deliver stuff
directly to your door.

430
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,880
You know how
you see FedEx Ground trucks?

431
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,720
Those aren't actually
FedEx employees,

432
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,519
despite every visual indication
to the contrary.

433
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:54,240
They may wear a FedEx uniform,
their truck may say "FedEx" on it,

434
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,920
and they may exclusively
deliver packages for FedEx,

435
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,119
but they are technically independent,

436
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,480
if you look carefully
at the side of the trucks,

437
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:05,119
you will see small fine print
indicating who actually owns it,

438
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,759
and it's not FedEx.

439
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,799
Amazon uses a similar model
with its "delivery service partners."

440
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,000
And again,
the appeal for Amazon is obvious.

441
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:17,200
Using drivers that aren't direct
employees allows them

442
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:21,000
to distance themselves from liability
when things go wrong.

443
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:25,559
Which they do, particularly given the
ridiculous pace that Amazon expects.

444
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,279
You've heard all of the stories about
drivers having to urinate into bottles

445
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:31,839
because they didn't have time to stop.

446
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,079
That speaks to the relentless pressure

447
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,680
to deliver
hundreds of packages per shift.

448
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:41,079
People are busting their ass,
driving way over the speed limit.

449
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:45,160
People are running through stop signs,
running through yellow lights.

450
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,720
Everybody I knew was buckling
their seat belt behind their backs

451
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:49,920
because the time it took

452
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,119
to buckle your seat belt,
unbuckle your seat belt every time

453
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:55,680
was enough time
to get you behind schedule.

454
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,200
Yeah, that's not good, is it?
I thought that everyone knew

455
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,400
the only place it's absolutely fine
not to have a seat belt

456
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,279
is, for some reason, a school bus.

457
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:08,799
That is where we collectively agreed
to skimp on them as a society.

458
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,559
"The kids'll be fine! We'll put
a little stop sign on the outside!

459
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,880
They'll be fine!"

460
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:18,000
If you think that nonstop pressure
seems an accident waiting to happen,

461
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:19,519
it already has.

462
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,599
Investigations by ProPublica
and Buzzfeed

463
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,039
found that, in a four-year window,
"drivers delivering Amazon packages

464
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:28,359
had been involved in more than 60
crashes that led to serious injuries,"

465
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,359
including 13 deaths.

466
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,400
Or, as that's more commonly known,
a Bezos' dozen.

467
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,079
But, again, Amazon
is basically off the hook here,

468
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,640
because these drivers
are not their employees,

469
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,960
they're independent contractors,
meaning that the contractor

470
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,160
is responsible for anything
that goes wrong, not them.

471
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,799
In fact, under Amazon's contracts,
they're even reportedly responsible

472
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,480
for paying Amazon's legal bills
in the event of a lawsuit.

473
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,559
Which, you know what,
is actually only fair.

474
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,160
It's not like Jeff Bezos can afford
to pay all those lawyers.

475
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,119
He's spending his money on things
that truly benefit society,

476
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,279
like launching himself into space,
before disappointing everyone,

477
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,920
and coming back home safely.

478
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,319
And amazingly,
I've got one more exploitative quirk

479
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,680
of this industry to show you.

480
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:15,200
And it's something called
"lease purchase agreements".

481
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,640
This is a system where drivers
who cannot afford their own truck,

482
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,079
are offered the chance to lease one
from the company they drive for,

483
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,880
with the promise that they'll earn
enough to pay it off and own it.

484
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,119
Here is one company
giving you the hard sell.

485
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:30,680
Own your future
with Western Express!

486
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:34,079
Find your true potential and earning
power with truck ownership!

487
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,960
Western's lease-purchase program
is like no other.

488
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,000
There's no money down, no credit
check, and no balloon payments.

489
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:43,799
At Western Express, we deliver
independence, one driver at a time!

490
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,319
Okay, for what it's worth,
I am immediately suspicious

491
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,839
of phrases like "own your future"
and "find your true potential."

492
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,359
Companies with selling points like that
leave you with nothing but debt

493
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,759
and a closet full of leggings

494
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:58,480
designed to turn your crotch
into a Magic Eye poster.

495
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:05,160
Drivers who participate in lease-to-own
agreements almost never succeed.

496
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,680
One trucking company executive
even estimated that,

497
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,799
of all the drivers entering
into their lease-purchase program,

498
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,119
only around five to 10 percent

499
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,279
ended up successfully taking
ownership of the truck.

500
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:18,799
So the odds
are heavily against you.

501
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,119
And as for the whole
"delivering independence" part,

502
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,319
that is the real irony here.

503
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,440
If you are leasing a truck
from the company you work for,

504
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,200
you are now tethered to them.

505
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,440
You are reliant on them
to give you loads, to earn money,

506
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:34,240
which you are then paying back
to them to pay off your lease,

507
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:36,839
on top of all the other expenses
they can throw at you.

508
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,759
This has been a common problem
for both long-haul and port truckers.

509
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,720
It takes drivers until...
They get paid each week,

510
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,119
and it could take them until Wednesday
or even Thursday

511
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,519
before they even begin
to make $100.

512
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,880
The reason is because the company
charges them to use the company truck.

513
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,960
They charge them to maintain
the company truck, to buy new tires.

514
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,640
They even charge these guys to park
the company truck at the company yard,

515
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,599
they can't even take it home.

516
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,319
It gets worse.

517
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,119
A company charged contractors
for using company toilet paper.

518
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,799
All of which can lead a driver
to owe their company money

519
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,359
at the end of a work week.

520
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,799
Can you imagine
picking up your paycheck,

521
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,119
and finding an envelope
full of negative five dollar bills?

522
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,920
You'd be absolutely furious.

523
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,960
And yes, that is John Wilkes Booth
on the negative five,

524
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,559
which makes sense,
he cancels out a Lincoln.

525
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,000
Just like how Aaron Burr
is on the negative 10,

526
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:34,599
and the negative 100 features
the 72-ounce steak Ben Franklin

527
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,240
choked on while trying
to win a T-shirt.

528
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:38,279
Learn your history!

529
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:41,319
So, drivers are stuck here.

530
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,680
If they stay with the company,
they can end up scraping to get by.

531
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:49,200
But if they leave, they risk losing
the truck they've poured so much into,

532
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:53,000
most lease-to-own agreements stipulate
that if the driver leaves the company,

533
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:56,920
it can take back the truck,
leaving the driver with nothing.

534
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,720
It is frankly no surprise
multiple trucking companies

535
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:02,319
have settled over
accusations brought by drivers

536
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,519
who found their lease-to-own
agreements predatory,

537
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,559
and in fact, Western Express,
the "own your future" company,

538
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,960
is currently awaiting court signoff of
a $15 million class-action settlement.

539
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,240
And I know at least one person
who might be happy to hear that.

540
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,680
Because just watch
this former Western Express driver

541
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:22,960
talking about how she felt misled
after opening a paycheck that came to,

542
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,279
after all the company's deductions,
just $293.

543
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:30,599
I'm pissed the fuck off.
If I had the strength

544
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:34,400
to pick this truck up and throw it
straight to Mars, I would.

545
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,160
Don't listen to those recruiters, 'cause
I'm telling you they fucking lying!

546
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:42,960
Lease purchase here is a lie!

547
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:45,599
Yeah!
And it is probably a good thing

548
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,880
that people aren't strong enough
to hurl a semi truck to Mars,

549
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,200
because if they were, NASA would
have to plan their rover missions

550
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:55,759
around the constant rain
of 35,000-pound debt traps.

551
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:59,839
So, what can we do here?
We should probably recognize

552
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,759
that we have all gotten used to the
idea of free, next-day shipping,

553
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:07,200
but, crucially, someone somewhere
always pays the price.

554
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:10,400
Second, the work arrangements
that drivers endure,

555
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,400
and the fundamental lack of value
placed on their time,

556
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,279
clearly needs to be addressed.

557
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:17,799
And the good news is, the Departments
of Transportation and Labor

558
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,400
are set to examine the type of
predatory truck leasing arrangements

559
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,680
that we just talked about.

560
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:26,880
They also plan to study the issue
of driver pay and unpaid waiting times.

561
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,240
And, hopefully,
they won't just study it,

562
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:31,799
but actually also fucking
do something about it.

563
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:35,759
Because the key way to stop
this so-called "shortage of drivers"

564
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,839
that we've actually
had for years now

565
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,039
is to make this a job that
people actually want to stay in.

566
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,640
And until we make big changes here,
the very least we can do

567
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,759
is make our trucking reality
shows a little more reflective

568
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:52,039
of what life on the road
for so many drivers is actually like.

569
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,599
Trucks: the lifeblood of America.
They flow across our highways,

570
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:03,319
driven by people tough enough to do
one of the grittiest jobs on Earth.

571
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,000
There's a lot of ways
you can die out here.

572
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:09,240
All right, baby,
we gotta get there.

573
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:13,359
From the makers of "Ice Road Truckers"
and "World's Toughest Trucker"

574
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,759
comes the realest reality show yet.

575
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,000
Each week, watch the best drivers
go up against the biggest odds,

576
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,680
navigating tough weather,
bumpy roads, and hardcore budgeting.

577
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,240
Okay. It's 14 grand for the engine,

578
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,079
fuel, oil change.

579
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,799
Don't forget the new tires.

580
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,880
Right.

581
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:38,400
God!

582
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,759
Yeah! These old road dogs
have diesel in their blood,

583
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,400
and they're living
the American dream.

584
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,839
It's kind of like being a cowboy.

585
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,799
I'm independent,
so I got my freedom.

586
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:53,279
I just gotta haul
what my company tells me,

587
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:56,920
where they tell me,
during the hours that they specify,

588
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:00,400
in a truck that I pay
for and do not own.

589
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,119
But on the plus side...

590
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:09,839
There's no slowing down
for these road warriors,

591
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,799
because in the freight industry,
every minute counts.

592
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,200
Fuck!

593
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,000
Except during loading
and unloading.

594
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
Fuck!

595
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,240
Dang it!

596
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:21,599
Come on.

597
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:24,640
Because those hours
are not compensated.

598
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,240
Is this your card?

599
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:31,039
Yes! This show brings you
all the thrills.

600
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,119
That's piss.
That's my own piss.

601
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,279
All the drama.

602
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:39,039
Is this a charge
for company toilet paper?

603
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,680
A man needs to wipe!

604
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,000
And all the romance
of life on the road.

605
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,319
I miss my wife.

606
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,240
The action literally never stops.

607
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,160
Hey, dispatch. I'm not safe to drive
right now, I'm falling asleep.

608
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,599
Roger, that, driver.
Why don't you pull over,

609
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,160
lie down in the back, curl up,
and fuck yourself right in the face,

610
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,880
because I ain't dealing
with that baby shit. Over.

611
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,160
I'm just worried
that someone could get hurt.

612
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:10,759
Somebody could get hurt? I didn't
realize I was talking to a drama queen.

613
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:13,640
Tony, get a load of fucking Hamlet
over here.

614
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:18,799
To drive or not to drive.
That is the question. Am I right?

615
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,279
Yeah. Whether 'tis nobler in the mind
to suffer the slings and arrows

616
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:26,759
of outrageous fortune, or to take
arms against a sea of troubles

617
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:28,359
and by opposing, end them?

618
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,920
That's you!
That's what you sound like!

619
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,839
You guys seem to both know
a lot of Hamlet verbatim.

620
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,920
Get back on the fucking road.

621
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:40,759
Hell yeah!
Get ready for 100 percent excitement,

622
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,079
100 percent adrenaline,
and 100 percent...

623
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,200
What, no, I didn't bring a coat.

624
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,240
Shit!

625
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:51,319
And it's not just truckers.

626
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:55,720
This show brings you everyone
from the drivers to the company owners.

627
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,559
Owners is a pretty strong term.

628
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,519
We have a much more casual
relationship with our trucks.

629
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:03,599
No labels.

630
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,039
Why complicate things?
I'm having fun. You're having fun.

631
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:12,119
This paycheck
says I owe you money?

632
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,160
Is that right?

633
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:18,559
Yeah. Do you have the cash?

634
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,480
Tune in to the show that brings you
as close as you can get

635
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:24,000
to the trucker life
without actually being one.

636
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:27,519
So yeah, neither one of us
go to the dentist anymore,

637
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,200
and you bring
your own toilet paper to work.

638
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,240
- I ordered a new pack from Amazon.
- You what?!

639
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:37,240
- What the fuck?
- Run!

640
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,920
"Trucked Up," coming to the
History Channel, for some reason.

641
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,640
That's our show, thanks for watching,
we'll see you next week, good night!

642
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,359
This thing's full of old
Backstreet Boys posters.

643
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,279
I don't know
why they need them.

644
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:02,599
You want a chip?

645
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:04,880
You don't get one.

646
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,799
I was shopping for caskets
last week online,

647
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,280
I was like,
"What the fuck are you doing, man?"

648
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,800
I'm hanging on by a thread.

649
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:19,280
Dear Rebecca,
I'm sorry I missed your play.

650
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,280
Your mother
said you did real good.

651
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:27,000
I can't wait to see you,
I just have to get this load in Reno.

652
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:29,559
This thing has power,
pure power, man.

653
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,360
I feel so strong,
it's like driving a gun.

654
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:35,559
I got a load!
I got big fuckin' load!

655
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,639
I wish I was fuckin' dead!

656
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,239
Yeah!
