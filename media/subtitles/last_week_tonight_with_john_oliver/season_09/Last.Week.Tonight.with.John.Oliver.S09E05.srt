00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,399
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:34,960
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight"!
I'm John Oliver.

3
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,960
Thank you so much for joining us.
Time for a quick recap of the week.

4
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,240
Russia's invasion of Ukraine
entered its second month,

5
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,240
North Korea launched
its biggest missile test in years,

6
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,399
and here in the U.S.,

7
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,439
the Senate held confirmation hearings
for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson,

8
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,960
where she had to answer
some absolutely batshit questions.

9
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,840
On a scale of one to 10,

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,520
how faithful would you say you are,
in terms of religion?

11
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,719
I'm a Hispanic man.
Could I decide I was an Asian man?

12
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,719
Do you think we should catch
and imprison more murderers,

13
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,879
or fewer murderers?

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,879
Do you agree with this book
that is being taught with kids,

15
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,239
that babies are racist?

16
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,280
Senator...

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,400
I do not believe...

18
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,319
Okay, just stop.
Because just for a second,

19
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,560
don't focus on the stupidity
of the questions there,

20
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,519
just appreciate
how exquisite that pause was.

21
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,439
In it was contained
the strength and patience

22
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,000
of every Black woman
being stretched to its absolute limit.

23
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,280
In that pause was the divine calculus
where she had to balance,

24
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,959
"How much do I want this job?"

25
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,319
and, "How much do I want to cuss out
these preposterous people?"

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,480
Call it the Chisholm-Johnson formula.

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,040
And look, obviously,
those questions were not asked

28
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,680
because they genuinely
wanted to know the answer.

29
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,799
They were asked
to generate viral soundbites.

30
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:56,599
The proof of which
is in this image of Ted Cruz,

31
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,239
right after his questioning, where
he's checking his mentions on Twitter

32
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,079
in the middle of the proceedings.

33
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,879
Which is honestly kind of amazing.
Can you imagine being Ted Cruz

34
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,080
and wanting to hear
what people think about you?

35
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:14,439
On the internet? That is a doom-scroll
that will not end well.

36
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,120
But for now,
let's move on to the royal family.

37
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,520
They've had a tough year, compared
to no one else who's ever lived,

38
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,240
from Harry and Meghan
talking to Oprah,

39
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,080
to Prince Andrew
being stripped of his titles

40
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:28,280
after-will-will legal
let me mention the things he did?

41
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,400
They won't?
Even though he definitely did them?

42
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:34,840
Okay then, I guess forget those things
I mentioned that he definitely did.

43
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,960
This was supposed to be a big week
for the royals,

44
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,400
with Prince William
and Kate Middleton

45
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,520
embarking on an official visit
to the Caribbean.

46
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,360
The moments royal tours
are made of.

47
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,159
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge
dancing with locals in Belize,

48
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:52,120
a visit officially to mark the Queen's
70 years on the throne,

49
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,560
also being dubbed
a "charm offensive",

50
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,719
an attempt to sway Caribbean nations
to hang onto the monarchy.

51
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,759
"Charm offensive?"
It's certainly one of those things.

52
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,639
It looks less like a royal visit

53
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:10,639
and more like Beach Barbecue Night
at Sandals Belize.

54
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,599
But it is true that this tour
was for two key reasons.

55
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,879
First, to celebrate the Queen's
70 years in power,

56
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,159
a milestone that she's definitely hit
because she's absolutely not dead.

57
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,280
Nope! No, don't do the dates!
Don't do the dates yet!

58
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:26,000
Why would you do that
when she's so obviously fine?

59
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,039
But this was a clear attempt to try
and keep the commonwealth together.

60
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,800
Especially as, just four months ago,

61
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,039
Barbados formally removed
the Queen as their head of state

62
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,199
and, during the same ceremony,
recognized Rihanna as a national hero,

63
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,080
proving Barbados is currently
making all of the right decisions here.

64
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,120
But instead of the fawning coverage
that the royals no doubt hoped for,

65
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,680
this tour has been a disaster.

66
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,520
Not quite the welcome
they were hoping for.

67
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,199
At one of the first places
William and Kate were supposed to visit,

68
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,400
protests forced the couple to cancel.

69
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,080
That was the first stop of day one!

70
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,479
Not a great signal
for the rest of your trip.

71
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,879
It's like getting to Disney World
and immediately being told,

72
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,680
"Sorry, theme park is closed to you,
your family committed genocide"

73
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,199
That is gonna set a tone
for the rest of your time in Orlando.

74
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,399
And things didn't get much better.

75
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,519
Before they landed in the Bahamas,
the national reparations committee there

76
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,639
released a statement, saying,
"The time is now for reparations",

77
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,839
ending the letter quoting
Bahamian artist Tony McKay, saying,

78
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,519
"I come to collect everything
that you owe me."

79
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:34,720
Which is a devastating way
to end a letter.

80
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,959
The only thing that could have made it
any more devastating

81
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,879
is simply adding the word, "bitch."

82
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,600
I mean, the bitch is implied there.
Don't get me wrong.

83
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,920
But it would have been lovely
to see it written down.

84
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,600
And then there was Jamaica,
where things continued going badly.

85
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,160
Protestors demanded an apology for the
royal family's role in the slave trade,

86
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,600
and made
some pretty pointed criticisms.

87
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,000
Mr. William, I see you love to dance
with the Black people,

88
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,000
and you love to frolic,

89
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,920
but speak some truth on this trip.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,439
Our goal is to loosen
and remove the hands,

91
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,439
the gloved hands,
of the Queen

92
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,519
from around our necks,
so that we can breathe.

93
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,839
How are these two young
white people now going to be here

94
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,199
saying we are going to kowtow to them,
and we are going to bend

95
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,720
and bow and kneel to them
as if they are gods?

96
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,720
Those days are done.
The monarchy is a relic.

97
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:32,680
Holy shit. William. Kate. Just go.
You just gotta leave.

98
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,439
If all those Black women have taken
time out of their day to call you

99
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,040
"Mr. William" and "those two
young white people," you're done.

100
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,759
You're just done.
It is over for you. All of it.

101
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:46,560
Having your entire thing in life
reduced down to "you love to frolic"

102
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,519
is fucking brutal.

103
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,040
The people of Jamaica have said,

104
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,839
"These two white people are unserious,
and we do not require them.

105
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,480
Please go frolic somewhere else,"
and I do not disagree with them.

106
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:59,160
And look, William and Kate
tried to turn things around.

107
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,560
They played some bongos,
they sat in a Jamaican bobsled,

108
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,680
they posed
next to a Bob Marley statue

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,040
while somehow managing to look
more lifeless than an actual statue.

110
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,439
But it all felt desperate.
And perhaps their lowest moment

111
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,720
came during their audience
with the Jamaican prime minister

112
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,839
because as he welcomed them in
for their initial photo op,

113
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,040
before the cameras had got settled,
he dropped this on them.

114
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,759
Jamaica is, as you would see,

115
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:27,879
a country that is very proud
of our history,

116
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,120
very proud
of what we have achieved,

117
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,879
and we are moving on

118
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,519
and we intend to attain in short order
our development goals

119
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,079
and fulfill our true ambitions

120
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,639
as an independent, developed,
prosperous country.

121
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,560
Shit! He basically broke up with them
before they could even sit down.

122
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,240
They didn't even make it
to the chairs!

123
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,120
It is hard to watch
that without getting flashbacks

124
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,959
to every time
you've been dumped.

125
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,199
Although, if you do need to break up
with someone in the future,

126
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,240
you should definitely do it like that.

127
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,680
"I'm sorry, Michelle, before we eat,
I just want to say,

128
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,720
I'm very proud of our history
and what we've achieved together,

129
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,000
but I'm moving on
and intend to fulfill my ambitions

130
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,879
as an independent, developed,
prosperous person.

131
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,040
Also, I hate every single one of your
friends, and I always have."

132
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,600
There were so many points during this
trip that it should've been abandoned.

133
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,720
How did no one on it
not look around and say,

134
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,639
"No one asked us to be here, everyone's
mad at us, we shouldn't be here."

135
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,600
Although to be fair, "No one asked us
to be here and now they're mad,"

136
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,319
is essentially British history
in two sentences.

137
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:43,439
The thing, though, is, even if
William and Kate were charming,

138
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,160
I'm not sure there is enough charm in
the universe to convince these nations

139
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,680
to stick with the monarchy.

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,199
This is an empire that invaded
their lands, robbed their wealth,

141
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,199
and enslaved and
murdered their people,

142
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,920
and now the royals have the fucking
balls to ask,

143
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,079
"Can you please keep us around?"

144
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:03,879
That has to be the single dumbest
question I've ever heard in my life.

145
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,720
Aside, maybe, from this.

146
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,000
Do you agree with this book
that is being taught with kids,

147
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,319
that babies are racist?

148
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,879
Exactly. And now, this.

149
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
And Now...

150
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,120
Yet Another Installment
of Coming Up on "Inside Edition".

151
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,040
Bugging out!

152
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:26,480
The President
attacked by a cicada.

153
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,959
Watch out for the cicadas!

154
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,560
Then, the guy who says
he was swallowed by a whale.

155
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,679
This is it.

156
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:37,240
He says it also happened to him.
Then, baby dinosaur mystery!

157
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,759
And, you call this lunch?
What the heck is this?

158
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,200
- Then...
- Not bad for an old man.

159
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,480
Then, storage lockers!

160
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:49,799
Millions of Americans
are storing their stuff in them.

161
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,200
And freak out!

162
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,879
Then, their songs so beautiful!

163
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,759
Plus, gator girl.
Plus, wild goose chase?

164
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,840
Or has he been eaten by alligators?

165
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,039
Then, chiropractors for babies.

166
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,879
And champagne wedding toast.
This is not gonna end well.

167
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:17,240
Moving on.
Our main story tonight concerns drugs.

168
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:20,799
They're something that we've often been
told to avoid through PSAs like this.

169
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,080
- Don't do drugs!
- Don't you do it now!

170
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,559
- Don't do drugs!
- No!

171
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,200
Someone plays you for a fool,
when they say, "Come on, be cool."

172
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,679
Just be smart and heed this rule.

173
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,919
Don't do drugs!

174
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,159
Just tell him
you got better things to do.

175
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,320
Cool!

176
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,919
Everyone knows
the hottest spot to snort coke

177
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,720
is a bench on a residential street
in broad daylight.

178
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,879
These days, you can't hang out on your
split level porch in your poodle skirt

179
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,440
without seeing those teens blowing
that snow like it's Jackson Hole.

180
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:02,240
But despite
those very compelling arguments,

181
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,039
millions upon millions of Americans
still use illicit drugs.

182
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,639
And it is easy to see why
drugs can be a lot of fun.

183
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,960
Some, in fact, can be so much fun
they end up ruining your fucking life.

184
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:15,600
Because the truth is,
that "Grease" fever dream

185
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,080
isn't entirely wrong to imply

186
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,679
that engaging with the illicit
drug supply can be dangerous.

187
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,320
This past decade has shown
a substantial rise in overdose deaths,

188
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,519
leading to alarming statistics
like this.

189
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,399
The CDC estimates
more than 100,000 Americans

190
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,759
died from drug overdoses over
a 12-month period ending this April,

191
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,919
a record.

192
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's nearly 3 times the number of deaths
from traffic accidents last year,

193
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,480
and more than twice
the number of gun deaths.

194
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,000
That is staggering.

195
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,840
And, quick side note here,
it is depressingly American

196
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,360
to be shocked that something
could cause more deaths than guns.

197
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:54,559
We are the only country
that would look at that and say,

198
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:57,399
"It's hard to believe that drug
overdoses are killing more people

199
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,600
than one of those natural
causes of death:

200
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,799
highly preventable loss of life
by loosely regulated weapons."

201
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,159
The fact is, street drugs
are an absolute mess right now,

202
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,200
as they've become so contaminated
one Yale researcher said,

203
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:14,200
"The whole supply
is absolutely fucked at this point."

204
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,120
And the rise in overdose deaths
has been driven by the presence

205
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,799
of one drug in particular,
and that is fentanyl, a synthetic opioid

206
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,639
often used prescriptively for things
like surgeries or cancer pain.

207
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,240
But outside of medical settings,
illegally manufactured fentanyl

208
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,279
has become a huge problem.

209
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,279
Because it,
and other synthetic opioids,

210
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,679
were involved in nearly two-thirds
of all overdose deaths

211
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:36,960
during the past year.

212
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,559
And while it is true that fentanyl
is incredibly potent,

213
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,440
the bigger problem is actually that
there's a dangerous lack of consistency

214
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,799
in the way it's currently distributed
within the street drug supply.

215
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:51,799
You can either know you're taking it,
on its own or in something like heroin,

216
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,399
but not know
how potent what you're taking is,

217
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,200
or you may not know
that you're taking it at all.

218
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,519
What we're seeing is that this opioid

219
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:05,759
is being found in a contaminated pill
supply in the whole United States.

220
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,679
They're using pill presses
that look like pills

221
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:12,320
for pharmaceuticals
that are currently marketed.

222
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,399
One day, I admitted
three people into the clinic.

223
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,759
All three of them
said they were taking oxycodone.

224
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,320
None of those three people
had any oxycodone tested

225
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,480
in their urine that we tested that day.
It was all fentanyl.

226
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,600
That's not great, is it?

227
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,639
The only time you should be surprised
by what is in your urine

228
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,960
is when you forgot you ate asparagus
earlier that day,

229
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,759
or, worst-case scenario, the shrunk-
down Magic School Bus comes out,

230
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,480
after a biology lesson
gone horribly wrong.

231
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:43,519
So, if the current drug supply
is this tainted and this dangerous,

232
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,840
we thought it'd be worth talking
about the overdoses that it can cause,

233
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:50,759
and the things that we should, and
shouldn't be doing to prevent them.

234
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,200
And let's start by acknowledging
some past mistakes.

235
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,039
Because for decades,
we've been fighting a war on drugs

236
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,480
that was often fueled
by fear and misinformation,

237
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,840
directly leading to bad policy.

238
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,840
In the 1980s, for instance, the risks
associated with crack cocaine use,

239
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:08,200
which were very real,
got cartoonishly inflated

240
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,759
into fear-mongering headlines
about a generation of crack babies,

241
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,919
with stories like, "Crack Babies
Turn 5, and Schools Brace,"

242
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,440
which was obviously shitty
and racist at the time

243
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:21,480
but has also since
been completely debunked.

244
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,279
That hysteria led to policies

245
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,000
like mandatory minimums
that fueled mass incarceration,

246
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,080
and laws that criminalized
everything surrounding drug use,

247
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,120
from paraphernalia to even locations
where drugs were used.

248
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,519
Unfortunately, we're seeing a similar
panic today brewing around fentanyl,

249
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,360
which, again,
is dangerous if ingested or injected.

250
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,919
But to hear law enforcement tell it,
it's dangerous to be anywhere near it.

251
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,720
Take this video from the San Diego
County Sheriff's Department,

252
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,080
and before I show it to you,
know the officer involved is fine,

253
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,600
for reasons I'll get to in a minute.

254
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:01,039
My trainee was exposed to fentanyl
and nearly died.

255
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,279
He found a white substance
that he suspected was drugs.

256
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,559
It tested positive for fentanyl. That
stuff's no joke, it is super dangerous.

257
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:12,879
A couple seconds later, he took
some steps back and he collapsed.

258
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:16,639
Again, don't worry,
that officer is completely fine.

259
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,120
And there should have been
a few immediate red flags there;

260
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,799
not only did the department voluntarily
release that body cam footage,

261
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:25,000
they also went to the trouble
of scoring it with music

262
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,919
that can only be described
as "funeral home slideshow".

263
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,720
But the idea that that officer could've
been passively exposed to fentanyl

264
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,720
and then overdosed
is completely absurd.

265
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:39,960
Experts say, "It is technically
impossible to touch fentanyl powder

266
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:42,960
and feel any effects from it,
let alone overdose,"

267
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:45,559
and "You would have to be
in some sort of wind tunnel

268
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,679
with massive amounts of fentanyl"
to accidentally inhale enough to OD.

269
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:52,360
And by the way,
"a wind tunnel full of fentanyl"

270
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,000
is quite the phrase there.

271
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,159
If you just add
"and roving gangs,"

272
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,320
you've pretty much got how
a racist uncle describes Chicago

273
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,240
after watching
too much Fox News.

274
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:04,240
And the thing is,
it's by no means just San Diego,

275
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:08,559
multiple police departments
have put out similar claims of OD-ing

276
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,320
through accidental ski-skin contact
or inhalation,

277
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:13,639
which again,
is basically impossible.

278
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,639
What those officers were much more
likely experiencing were panic attacks.

279
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,320
Which makes sense, in a way, because
they'd just been exposed to something

280
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,919
they've repeatedly heard is deadly
to be anywhere near.

281
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,200
This has now become such a trope,
it was a plot point on "Blue Bloods,"

282
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:32,519
where Donnie Wahlberg's partner briefly
picks up a tray with fentanyl on it,

283
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,840
and then this happens.

284
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,320
- What she came in contact with?
- Perp said she got fentanyl.

285
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:41,039
She was fine one second,
the next minute, she's not breathing.

286
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,399
Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid,
50 to 100 times stronger than morphine.

287
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,720
The slightest exposure
can trigger an overdose.

288
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:50,679
Yeah, that is complete horseshit.

289
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:52,879
Not that you'd expect
any more nuance

290
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,679
from a show
that's basically adult "Paw Patrol."

291
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,799
But the point is,
it is deeply irresponsible of police

292
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:03,200
to keep perpetuating
a medical impossibility,

293
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,080
and for media outlets
to keep amplifying it.

294
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:08,559
For a start,
it might make people afraid to help

295
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,759
someone they see experiencing
an overdose,

296
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,879
why risk giving someone CPR if they
might be covered in powdered death?

297
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,240
And also,
when you treat a drug like a bioweapon,

298
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,120
you justify a punitive,
militarized response to it.

299
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,799
A couple years back, an Ohio man
received additional prison time

300
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,519
for assault on a police officer after
officers searched his car for drugs

301
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,039
"and found powder that later
tested positive for fentanyl."

302
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,399
And that exposure to fentanyl alone
constituted the assault.

303
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,559
And look, if fentanyl
really were smallpox in a bottle,

304
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,919
maybe it'd make sense for total
eradication to be our goal.

305
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,960
But it isn't. So, it frankly
makes much more sense

306
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:49,600
to focus on how to protect those
genuinely at risk of overdosing on it

307
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,879
and that is the people
taking it.

308
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,480
Which is to say the rest of this piece
is going to be about harm reduction.

309
00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:00,559
Harm reduction accepts the reality
that people will use illegal drugs,

310
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,559
and that some either can't,
or don't want to, stop.

311
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,240
So, rather than arrest them,

312
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,400
we might be better off trying
to mitigate the damage done.

313
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,599
It's a concept that you
might already be familiar with

314
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,640
through things
like syringe services programs,

315
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,279
which give people clean needles
and are proven

316
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,279
to massively help drive down
the spread of disease.

317
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:22,079
And right now, if you genuinely want
o reduce the number of overdoses,

318
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,079
there are some important tactics
that we could encourage.

319
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,960
First, there is drug checking.

320
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,359
The simple act of testing drugs
to find out what is in them.

321
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,039
This can be done through things
like fentanyl testing strips,

322
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,720
or reagent test kits.

323
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,559
These are very valuable tools
to keep people safe,

324
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,200
and yet, thanks to those drug-war
era laws on paraphernalia

325
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:42,599
that I just mentioned earlier,

326
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,720
they're technically illegal
in all of these states,

327
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,880
making it a liability to carry them.

328
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,799
Which is just complete madness.

329
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,680
Thankfully, some states have written
carve-outs for specific methods,

330
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:55,559
like fentanyl testing strips.

331
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,119
And others are choosing not to enforce
their stupid laws criminalizing them.

332
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,359
The problem is, though,
police officers may not be aware,

333
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,119
or indeed care about,
those carve-outs,

334
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,519
and are still very much
arresting people,

335
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:12,279
or using testing equipment
as probable cause for further searches.

336
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:15,079
And all this means people
are still getting locked up

337
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,799
because they were carrying
a lifesaving tool.

338
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,400
Which is ridiculous, because if any
life-saving tool should be criminalized,

339
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,640
it obviously should not
be drug checking equipment,

340
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,839
it should be the Heimlich maneuver.

341
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,920
I'm sorry,
but let's get this very clear here.

342
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:32,359
If you see me choking,
that is frankly none of your business.

343
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:36,200
If I die, let me die doing
my favorite thing in the world:

344
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:38,759
not being surprise-hugged
by a stranger.

345
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,079
Do not touch me
under any circumstances!

346
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,440
Then there's the harm reduction method
you're probably already aware of,

347
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:50,759
and that is naloxone,
also known by the brand name, Narcan.

348
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,519
Naloxone, as this woman
who works in harm reduction explains,

349
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,319
can quickly reverse
an opioid overdose.

350
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,440
Pretend that like this, this is the
fentanyl coming in your system.

351
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,359
So, when you shoot someone up
with Narcan, it's like a wall goes up

352
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,920
and so the fentanyl hits the wall,
it can't keep on going.

353
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,240
The more Narcan you put into
the system, the bigger that wall gets.

354
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:13,400
What you're saying is it's actually
quite easy to reverse an overdose?

355
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,720
Yes, it is.

356
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,920
Right. It's incredibly effective.

357
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,920
Naloxone has got to be in the
hall of fame for erasing mistakes,

358
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,799
right up there with the pencil eraser,
the control-Z key,

359
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,799
and starring in "Daddy's Home 2."

360
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:28,920
What a fun family!
What a cranky dad!

361
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,480
I wonder if there were any fun pranks
or voicemails on the set!

362
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,720
I bet there were.

363
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,839
The point is, though,
naloxone is a fucking miracle.

364
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,240
Which is why it is so frustrating
that the FDA

365
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:42,920
currently has it
under "prescription-only" status,

366
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,799
something even the AMA
has said should be changed.

367
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,880
And while every state has adopted
some kind of workaround,

368
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,200
meaning an individual can theoretically
get it without seeing a doctor first,

369
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:55,039
it can be very difficult.

370
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:57,640
And for community groups
who want to buy it in bulk

371
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,599
so that they can distribute it directly
to the people who need it the most,

372
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,559
it can be basically impossible.

373
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,880
And look, there are certain things
you would want to go out of your way

374
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,079
to discourage people
from having in their homes...

375
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,920
Nazi flags, pet chimps, a TV playing
an episode of "Blue Bloods",

376
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,240
but Narcan
is absolutely not one of them.

377
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,599
But perhaps the biggest step that
we could make regarding harm reduction

378
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,599
is to properly support
overdose prevention centers,

379
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,039
sometimes called
supervised injection sites.

380
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:27,079
They're places where people
can bring their own drugs

381
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,359
and have access to clean supplies
and trained professionals

382
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,559
who can intervene
in the event of an overdose,

383
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,400
as well as direct them
toward tons of other services,

384
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,160
including addiction treatment,
if they so choose.

385
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,079
Here's a look inside one of them
right here in New York City.

386
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:44,839
When we were inside, there were
half a dozen clients using drugs.

387
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,720
No more improperly
discarded syringes on the streets,

388
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:50,039
near our schools,
in our subway stations.

389
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,880
You won't, you find way less...

390
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,119
Everything is done onsite,
safely, securely,

391
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,920
without having to worry
about overdosing.

392
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,680
The voice behind the divider
belonged to a man named Oz,

393
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:06,039
who told us he's a Marine Corps veteran
and was using heroin as we spoke.

394
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:11,960
I've gotten more help here
than I've gotten from the V.A.

395
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,440
That is incredible.

396
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:18,599
And I know that we, as a society, have
learned not to trust anyone named Oz

397
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,559
who is either yelling
at you from behind a curtain

398
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,279
or trying to talk to you
about something medical.

399
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,279
But we should make an exception here
on both counts

400
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:29,559
because this particular Oz
makes a very important point:

401
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,359
overdose prevention centers
provide crucial services

402
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,279
that keep people who use drugs
as safe as possible.

403
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,079
And yet,
whenever they are floated as an option,

404
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,200
people freak the fuck out.

405
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:44,000
It's actually
a heroin shooting gallery.

406
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,680
It is a community center
for heroin addicts to go and shoot up

407
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:51,240
under supervision,
which I think is-is crazy.

408
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:54,720
The best way to prevent overdoses
from heroin

409
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,720
is to have people stop doing heroin.

410
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:59,319
They called it harm reduction centers,

411
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:03,799
but in my way of thinking,
it's really harm enabling centers.

412
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,720
There's many other things to deal with
than letting people shoot up safely.

413
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:12,079
It's like condoning doing drugs.
It's like, "Why don't I go do it?"

414
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,319
Okay, but that's not
at all what these centers are for.

415
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,000
They're not for the heroin-curious
to sample flights of syringes like IPAs.

416
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,240
They're to help people
who already use drugs

417
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:25,440
do so in a way
that won't fucking kill them.

418
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,319
We know overdoses often happen
when people use drugs alone,

419
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,759
with no one around to help them,

420
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:34,000
and these facilities are designed
to make sure that that doesn't happen.

421
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:36,240
And politicians
who actually study these sites,

422
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,559
like the former mayor of Ithaca,
New York, come away impressed.

423
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,240
The first time I heard it,
I thought it sounded

424
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,359
like we were just enabling people
to use drugs.

425
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,839
But the truth is,
in the places where it's worked,

426
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:53,759
in Australia and Europe and Canada,
more people get off of drugs,

427
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,759
like people
who use supervised injection

428
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:58,119
are 30 percent more likely
to enter into treatment,

429
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,599
and they're 100 percent
less likely to die.

430
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,920
Underline that last point: 100 percent.
No one has ever died there.

431
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:10,599
There has never been a recorded death
in any overdose prevention center.

432
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,799
That is insane!
People die everywhere!

433
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,559
People die at Chuck E. Cheese!
All the time, by the way!

434
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,160
The ball pit there is,
and this is true, mostly bones.

435
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,519
You want to know that rat's real name?
It's Charles Execution Cheese.

436
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:29,359
And yet, despite the fact that clip
was from six years ago,

437
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,519
Ithaca still doesn't have
an overdose prevention center.

438
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:34,000
Because when cities
float opening one,

439
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,079
questions around their morality, even
legality make it next to impossible.

440
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,480
Just recently, an OPC in Philadelphia
was prevented from opening

441
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:45,119
after a three-judge panel found it
violated a provision in federal law

442
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,039
known as the "crack house statute,"

443
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:51,240
which bans facilities that operate
for the purpose of using illegal drugs.

444
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:56,440
Yet another 1980s law that we're still
suffering from which is just infuriating.

445
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,920
So often, the problem
facing all harm reduction programs

446
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,720
is that people are so angry
with those who use drugs,

447
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,000
they want to try
and punish them into abstinence.

448
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:07,759
But that is not
how any of this works.

449
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,200
And advocates have been trying
to tell us this for a long time,

450
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,400
like Louise Vincent,
who points out that for decades,

451
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,759
we've been going
at this completely wrong.

452
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,079
All we do is disconnect people
in the United States.

453
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:23,000
So, if you are found to be a person
who uses drugs and needs help,

454
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:24,759
we start with disconnecting you.

455
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:29,000
And I truly believe that addiction
is the opposite of connection.

456
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:33,880
So, what we do is everything
wrong to help a person.

457
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,960
We disconnect people
from their families,

458
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:40,119
we disconnect people from their friends,
we alienate people from work,

459
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:42,400
we disconnect them from community,

460
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:46,119
and then we disconnect
them from their freedom, finally,

461
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,480
and when people finally have nothing
left then they will use until they die.

462
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,960
Right. When people have nothing left,
they will use until they die.

463
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:59,079
It is fucking dark, it's horrible,
and, right now,

464
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,400
you can make a pretty good case that,
deliberate or not,

465
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,039
it is the end-goal
of U.S. public health policy.

466
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:06,960
So, given that,
what do we do from here?

467
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,519
For starters, the FDA should remove
naloxone's prescriptiononly status,

468
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:12,359
and they should do that right now.

469
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,240
And crucially, not for expensive
brand-name nasal sprays like Narcan,

470
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:19,720
but for low-cost, generic naloxone,
which is 30 times cheaper.

471
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:23,160
As for state legislatures, they should
reexamine their paraphernalia laws

472
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,319
to make sure people aren't held liable
for holding basic protective tools

473
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,000
like drug testing equipment.

474
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:31,920
We need a full-throated endorsement
of overdose prevention centers

475
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,880
from the Biden administration,
because remember,

476
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,160
right now, as Philly is finding out,
they are arguably illegal,

477
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,200
thanks to that crack house statute.

478
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,039
Biden administration could intervene
and take a stand in their favor,

479
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:46,119
which is frankly the very least
that Biden could do.

480
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,519
If you're wondering "Who is the guy who
authored the crack house legislation?"

481
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,160
I've got some bad news for you.

482
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,960
I'm the guy who authored
the crack house legislation.

483
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,960
Thanks for clarifying, Joe.
Nice Larry King costume, by the way!

484
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:03,359
And look, this administration
has done some real good

485
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,920
in being the first to broadly
endorse harm reduction tactics.

486
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,000
But advocates say
that much more is needed,

487
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:11,519
including making sure
that people who use drugs

488
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:13,799
have a seat at the table
during policy discussions,

489
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,160
and that funding gets
to community-based organizations

490
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,119
providing the most services
for them.

491
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,519
But we all need
to get on board here.

492
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:25,200
Our engrained stigmas around drugs
and the people who use them run deep.

493
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,920
And if we actually want to minimize
deaths and keep people safe,

494
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,240
the facts point
in a very clear direction.

495
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,319
We need to meet people
where they are,

496
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,319
help them transition
into safe drug use to stay alive,

497
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,480
and remove barriers for those
seeking addiction treatment.

498
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:42,240
And what we absolutely
need to stop doing

499
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:46,039
is spreading misinformation
and warehousing drug users in prisons.

500
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,480
Or, to say all of that
much more succinctly,

501
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,599
it is well past time to start paying
attention to the man behind the curtain.

502
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,240
And now, this!

503
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,079
And Now: Still More of Coming Up
on "Inside Edition."

504
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,400
Peacock invasion!

505
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:05,799
It sounds
like babies being tortured.

506
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,039
Then, the Brazilian butt lift.

507
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:10,880
Then, tortoise theft!

508
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,960
And you've been replaced
by a robot waitress!

509
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,640
Then, buddy, how's the fishing?

510
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,000
Plus...

511
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,720
9-1-1 bad haircut.

512
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:25,839
And do face coverings
prevent women from getting catcalls?

513
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,000
Plus...

514
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,400
Is the baby in danger?

515
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:32,160
Then, the woman they're calling
"Hula-Hoop Karen."

516
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,880
And mask wars Karen!

517
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,920
And why these people
named Karen are fed up.

518
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,559
Plus, supermodel Gisele
saving the turtle!

519
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,559
Then, the loopy Taylor Swift patient

520
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,319
whose dentist
doesn't like Taylor Swift.

521
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
You don't like Taylor Swift.
Don't touch me!

522
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:55,599
Moving on. Finally tonight,
I'd like to talk about Alaska.

523
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,319
It's the single best place to see
a salmon jumping into a bear's mouth,

524
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,599
and, if you're really lucky,
a bear jumping into a salmon's mouth.

525
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,000
It's rare, but when it happens,
it's beautiful.

526
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,640
Specifically, I'd like to talk about
one of Alaska's greatest treasures,

527
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,400
the Nenana Ice Classic.

528
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,279
It's a yearly contest
that you may not have heard of,

529
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:13,920
but it's happening right now,
and it's absolutely incredible.

530
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:15,400
Here is how it works.

531
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,720
With the placing of the tripod
on the frozen Tanana River yesterday,

532
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,880
the Nenana Ice Classic
is off and running.

533
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:23,880
The Ice Classic
involves guessing when the tripod

534
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,079
connected to a clock
near the riverbank

535
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,559
will fall through the melting river ice,
with the closest guess winning.

536
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:34,759
It's true, every year, the people
in the small Alaskan town of Nenana

537
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:37,000
put a giant wooden tripod
on a frozen river

538
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:39,920
and place bets on exactly when the ice
will melt enough to break up,

539
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,519
and the tripod floats downstream.

540
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:42,920
And before we go any further,
let me just say,

541
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,880
if you are not intrigued by I just said,
turn this show off right now.

542
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,359
If you just heard me describe people
betting on ice melting

543
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,319
and didn't think,
"Sounds great, tell me more, John,"

544
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,400
change the channel,
shut your laptop,

545
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,640
close the YouTube video on your phone,
hit the "un-Roku" button on your Roku,

546
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,079
whatever you have to do,
just get this show away from your face.

547
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,519
This is not a program for you.
You don't need to watch it.

548
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:06,000
I don't want you to watch it.
I don't want to be in your life.

549
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,319
Fuck off!

550
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,880
Now for the rest of us,
the Nenana Ice Classic is

551
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:17,160
"one of the oldest continuously running
betting events in the United States."

552
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,839
It officially began back in 1917,
"when a handful of railroad engineers

553
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,079
decided to bet on the ice breakup
to help pass the long Alaskan winter."

554
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,200
And already,
I cannot help but wondering,

555
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,039
what else did they do to pass the time
before they came up with that idea?

556
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:34,200
"Let's see, guys, we played cards,
sang songs,

557
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:37,119
wrote letters home, drank heavily,
and experimented with cannibalism,

558
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,440
but we've still got
two months of winter left.

559
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:41,880
So, who's up for betting
on when that ice over there melts?"

560
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,559
If you're wondering how they determine
the exact moment the contest is over,

561
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,799
they've devised
a pretty amazing system.

562
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,759
We have developed
a mechanism that tells us

563
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:53,279
when the tripod
moves 100 feet down the river.

564
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,400
It consists of pulleys,

565
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:59,079
wire,

566
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,720
a cleaver,

567
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:02,680
two different types of rope,

568
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,039
there's twisted poly
and then there's braided poly.

569
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,920
Half of a 55-gallon drum
that's filled with rocks,

570
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:13,440
a clothesline,
and the special clock.

571
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,839
Excellent. They basically made
a Rube Goldberg machine

572
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,799
out of random items
to call this contest.

573
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,519
And honestly, I wish it was
even more complicated than that.

574
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:25,480
How about this: when the tripod
hits 100 feet downriver,

575
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:28,119
it pulls a rope that runs to the tower,
which is connected to a hook

576
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,079
that pulls up a garbage can
filled with Doritos,

577
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,160
and that releases a basketball,
which rolls down a wooden plank

578
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,000
and pulls a string attached
to a pair of scissors,

579
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:37,480
which cuts a clothesline,
which is tied thousands of miles away

580
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:40,359
to the back of Robert De Niro's pants
and it pulls his pants down,

581
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,000
which then pulls another string back
at the tower that trips a wire,

582
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:46,000
which drops a second garbage
can filled with Microsoft Zunes,

583
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:49,720
which lands on three dozen eggs,
the egg yolk runs down into a funnel

584
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:53,119
that flows into a cup, and once the cup
is filled, it pushes an air pump,

585
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,640
which fills a balloon until it pops,
the balloon's string pulls open a gate

586
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,920
that releases a marble,
which rolls down a spiral track

587
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,440
and hits a man named Doug in the head,
and then Doug unplugs the clock.

588
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:06,680
It might not be as accurate,
but it would be really fun to watch.

589
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:10,839
To recap, the moment the tripod
floats 100 feet downriver,

590
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,599
the clock stops,
and the contest is over.

591
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,400
Here is that glorious moment
from a past year!

592
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,240
Woo, baby!

593
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:20,640
Look at it!

594
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,039
Look at it go!

595
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,559
The clock has stopped!

596
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,599
The clock has stopped.

597
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:33,720
Look at it go,

598
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:36,279
I could not ask
for a better breakup, baby.

599
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:38,720
I've never witnessed this before.

600
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,400
You haven't?
What do you think?

601
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,039
It's good.

602
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,799
Don't you envy that woman?

603
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:51,759
Don't you envy
how much unbridled joy she felt

604
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:55,519
watching a giant wooden tripod
float down a partially frozen river?

605
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:56,839
She's got life figured out.

606
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,839
We're over here
running around like idiots,

607
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,880
being miserable all the time
about everything,

608
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,359
while she's up in Alaska
watching ice melt

609
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,480
and experiencing
a level of pure happiness

610
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,720
that the rest of us
will never feel in our pathetic lives.

611
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:10,759
That woman is living her best life,
and we are all dipshits.

612
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,720
The way you enter the Ice Classic is
by filling out a card with your guess,

613
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:18,759
and dropping it off
with the $2.50 entry fee,

614
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:21,400
into one of these
red Ice Classic betting cans.

615
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,799
Which are delivered to gas stations,
bars, and stores all over Alaska.

616
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,559
Each year, they sell over a quarter
of a million entry tickets,

617
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,440
with last year's jackpot
being over $230,000.

618
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:35,319
It was split evenly
between 12 winners.

619
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,559
If you're thinking "12 different entries
had the exact day, hour, and minute

620
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,799
that this giant wooden thing
floated 100 feet downstream?"

621
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,079
That is exactly what I'm telling you.
Keep paying attention!

622
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,200
One of the reasons for that is that
you are technically allowed to place

623
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:53,480
as many bets as you want,
as long as you pay the fee each time.

624
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:56,079
And the contest isn't just fun
for everyone who takes part.

625
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,440
It actually provides a valuable
source of climate change data

626
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,880
by measuring the river ice breakup
to the minute each year.

627
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,640
As one climate specialist put it,

628
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,839
"It's almost as perfect
a climate record as you could get."

629
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,119
And the final thing
that you should know

630
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,119
is the participation
isn't just limited to Alaskans.

631
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,160
Anyone in the world
can apparently place a bet.

632
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,039
Due to Alaskan gaming regulations,

633
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:20,720
they can't physically
mail the tickets out to you,

634
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:25,000
but "you can mail your list
of guesses along with $2.50 per guess

635
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:27,000
to the Nenana Ice Classic office,"

636
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:29,240
and they will gladly
fill out the tickets for you.

637
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:32,319
At this point, you can probably see
where I'm going with this, right?

638
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:34,839
You think I'd spend 10 minutes

639
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,200
talking about the single greatest
ice melting contest in the world,

640
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,640
and then say, "Goodnight then,"
and end the show?

641
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,480
No, that's not how we operate here.

642
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,319
Of course, we're betting
on this fucking ice melting contest.

643
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,960
Of course, that's happening!

644
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,920
We decided to place exactly
one bet on this year's competition

645
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,359
for April 26th, 2022,
at exactly 2:17 PM.

646
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,359
Why? I just have
a really good feeling about it.

647
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:02,440
We could have placed more bets than
that, but it didn't really feel right.

648
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,759
'Cause what would stop
someone from placing bets

649
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:08,079
for every minute of every day
for the entire month of April?

650
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,519
Then it just becomes a contest
of "who has the most money?"

651
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:13,639
And that's already the general contest
for life in America.

652
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,599
And initially, we were going
to mail our guesses to Alaska.

653
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,199
Until we realized that's not entering
into the true spirit of this contest.

654
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:24,440
So instead, we decided last week
to go all the way to Nenana

655
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:27,199
and drop off our bet
in one of those red cans.

656
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,519
And when I say "we," let me be
very clear here, I don't mean me.

657
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,960
I did not go to Alaska.

658
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,960
You really think that this could
handle a harsh Alaskan winter?

659
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,039
My apartment's thermostat
is set to "dainty boy."

660
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,000
Thankfully, I know someone with
a perfect body for such an adventure.

661
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:48,360
Several years ago, in an attempt
to help celebrate Earth Day,

662
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,559
we introduced a new mascot,
Marshmallow,

663
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,719
the polar bear
with a broken penis.

664
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,719
Why was his penis broken?

665
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:57,920
I honestly cannot remember,
and I doubt it really matters.

666
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,360
But long story short,
the organizers of Earth Day

667
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,519
refused to adopt Marshmallow
as their mascot,

668
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:07,039
shattering his heart, like his penis,
into 1,000 different pieces.

669
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,199
As Marshmallow's been sitting around
with nothing to do for seven years now,

670
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,760
he was more than happy
to drop our bet off in person,

671
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,920
Which is exactly what he did.
Take a look!

672
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,960
They say the journey of 1,000 miles
starts with a single step.

673
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,159
But for this polar bear,

674
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,599
it began with a fond farewell
to his employer,

675
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,559
a 90-minute cab ride to Newark,
virtually no TSA line,

676
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,760
and an eight-hour flight.

677
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:40,760
But once in Alaska,
Marshmallow was ready to go.

678
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:44,000
Unfortunately, his luggage was not.

679
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,360
Feels like the fish bags
always come out last.

680
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,280
Fucking Alaska Airlines.

681
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,239
As he set out, Marshmallow faced
an omen of a perilous path ahead.

682
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,000
Here was a fate far worse
than a broken penis:

683
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,199
being stuck at the airport forever.

684
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,400
Marshmallow knew this journey
wouldn't be easy.

685
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,840
Trekking through a vast,
arctic expanse of snow,

686
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:13,960
sub-zero cold,
and winds that cut to the bone.

687
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,840
No one seemed willing
to lend a hand, or even a horn.

688
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:24,000
And when Marshmallow's paws
took him as far as they could go,

689
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:26,960
and he was at his physical
and mental limits,

690
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,639
he called an Alaskan Uber.

691
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,320
Now that's a five-star ride.

692
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:40,079
And soon, he'd reached
his destination: Nenana!

693
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,719
Home of the Ice Classic.

694
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,639
It was time for this bear
to fulfill his destiny

695
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:51,800
by placing a single bet for $2.50
in an ice melting contest.

696
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,760
April 26th, 2:17 PM.

697
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:02,840
The wager 100 percent guaranteed
to win this year's Ice Classic.

698
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:06,840
And with his bet placed,

699
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:12,400
a kind stranger said the nicest words
anyone had ever said to Marshmallow.

700
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,400
Thanks, Marshmallow.
Good luck to you.

701
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,719
And I hope your penis feels better.

702
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,960
So did Marshmallow.
But our bear's journey wasn't complete.

703
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:30,480
He had one more thing left to see.

704
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,000
And suddenly, there it was!

705
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,800
The mighty tripod
on the Tanana River,

706
00:37:56,199 --> 00:38:00,119
as straight and sturdy
as Marshmallow's penis was not.

707
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,800
We all face a foreboding tundra at some
point in life that we must cross.

708
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:13,119
But it's the fire on the inside

709
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:16,440
that pushes us through
the bitter cold on the outside.

710
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,760
And as long as that fire
burns within you,

711
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:23,239
anything is possible.

712
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,920
Except for fixing a broken penis.

713
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:35,719
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome back from Alaska,

714
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,559
Marshmallow, the polar bear
with a broken penis!

715
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:44,400
Welcome back, Marshmallow!

716
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,079
Welcome back, old friend!

717
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,880
How was Alaska?

718
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,159
You can't talk 'cause your penis
hurts too much and you're a bear?

719
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:55,679
I'm sorry, I forgot
about that, buddy.

720
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:00,159
The point is, our bet for this year's
Ice Classic is officially in.

721
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:02,679
And when we win,
I'm proud to announce

722
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,960
that we will donate our entire prize
to the Food Bank of Alaska.

723
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,199
And if for some weird reason
we don't win,

724
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,280
we're going to donate
$10,000 to them anyway.

725
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:14,360
If you want to find out more
about how to bet on the Ice Classic,

726
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,840
there is information
on how to do that at this address.

727
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,079
So, have fun,
and may the best guess win!

728
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,360
That is our show, thank you so
much for watching,

729
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,039
thank you to Marshmallow here.

730
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
Good night!

731
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:29,159
We did it!
We did it, buddy! We did it.

732
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,920
Bye!

733
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:33,519
Bye!

734
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:35,679
Let's ride!
