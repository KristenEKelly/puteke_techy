LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:33,880
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight",
I'm John Oliver.

3
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,039
Thank you so much for joining us.
It has been a busy week,

4
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,840
including, least importantly,
the Queen's Platinum Jubilee,

5
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,039
marking her 70 years on the throne,
which featured the royal family

6
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:46,719
appearing on the balcony
of Buckingham Palace,

7
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,600
multiple cakes shaped
like demented corgis,

8
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:56,640
and one school doing whatever the fuck
this absolute living nightmare is.

9
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,320
It was basically a four-day celebration
of everything that the Queen loves,

10
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,159
with one key exception.

11
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,319
The question was what to do
with a problem like Andrew,

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,959
and it seems
like that's taken care of itself

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,480
because we have the news
that he tested Covid positive.

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,159
I think a lot of people out there
are questioning the validity of that

15
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,640
'cause it's very convenient.

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,760
He did test positive, they said,
so he must have a certificate.

17
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,640
Do you think that people
will demand to see that certificate?

18
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,000
I don't think
they're going to get to see it.

19
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,079
I don't think that they will either.

20
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,359
Based on what generally happens
to information about Prince Andrew,

21
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,799
that Covid test will probably
conveniently commit suicide in prison.

22
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,400
Or you know what?

23
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,599
Maybe he'll pay us all millions
of pounds to stop bringing it up.

24
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,120
Those do seem to be
his two go-to moves.

25
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,959
But instead of focusing on that,

26
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,280
we're actually going to start
with our main story tonight,

27
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,640
which concerns what happened
in Uvalde, Texas 12 days ago,

28
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:54,680
when an 18-year-old
armed with two AR-15's

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,159
killed 19 children and two teachers
at an elementary school.

30
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:03,599
We all know what the key problem
is here. It's guns.

31
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,319
It's because we let whoever wants
to buy a gun in this country have one.

32
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,479
Which has led
to tragic consequences.

33
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,680
The vast majority of mass shooters,

34
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:15,960
including the shooters
at Uvalde and Parkland,

35
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,400
obtained the weapons they used
through legal purchases.

36
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,960
So, we know what the answer
to this problem is, too.

37
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:26,439
It's gun control.
It's meaningful, effective gun laws.

38
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,240
But that hasn't stopped
some from desperately pitching

39
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:32,439
absolutely anything other
than that as a solution.

40
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,719
The only solution is Christ Jesus,
and being able to get some type

41
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,680
of spirituality and prayer
back into our schools.

42
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,240
Man traps. A series of interlocking
doors at the school entrance

43
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,159
that are triggered by a tripwire.

44
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,039
I would like to see this,
a national push toward,

45
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,879
instead of parents buying their kids
all these tools and toys and games,

46
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,840
invest in the classroom
to make it safer.

47
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,080
They have blankets
that you can put up on the wall

48
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,759
that are colorful and beautiful,
but they're ballistic blankets.

49
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,319
What are you talking about?

50
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,159
"Use a blanket"

51
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,719
is not a strategy for stopping deaths
during a school shooting.

52
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,360
It's barely a strategy
for "a bird got in the house".

53
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:17,479
And while those ideas are ridiculous,
"hardening our schools"

54
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,400
often comes up
as an alternative to gun control.

55
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,000
And at the NRA convention that
inexplicably still took place in Texas

56
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,680
just three days
after the shooting there,

57
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,000
Wayne LaPierre
pitched the same solution

58
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,479
that he did after Sandy Hook,
and after Parkland.

59
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,800
We also need to fully fund
our nation's police departments

60
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,080
and school security
resource officer programs.

61
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,080
Exactly. Put police,
or school resource officers, or SROs,

62
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,680
as they're sometimes called,
into schools.

63
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,400
I guess it's not that surprising that
the solution from the CEO of the NRA

64
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,039
is more people with guns,
because it'd be like hearing,

65
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,840
"The garbage dump is overflowing,
so we need more piles of garbage",

66
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:03,840
from the head of the
National Raccoon Association.

67
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,919
What else
do you really expect him to say?

68
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,280
But the idea
of adding police to schools

69
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,639
does seem to come up in the wake
of every big school shooting.

70
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:17,079
And crucially,
it's then the thing that we always do.

71
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,079
In the six years
after the Columbine massacre in 1999,

72
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,720
the federal government
"awarded over $750 million,

73
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,199
resulting in the hiring
of over 6,500 SROs".

74
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,879
And since then,
it has exploded to the point

75
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,360
that the most recent data available
shows 58 percent of American schools

76
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:38,800
report having a sworn
law enforcement officer on campus

77
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,319
at least once a week.

78
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,959
And this has happened

79
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,120
even as vital resources
for students have been starved.

80
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,560
A recent report found 14 million
students go to a school with police

81
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,480
but without a counselor, nurse,
psychologist, or social worker.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,439
14 million kids who are in closer
proximity to a pair of handcuffs

83
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,959
than they are to a medical
or mental health professional.

84
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,600
And to hear some cops tell it,

85
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,519
there is upside to their presence
that goes far beyond school safety,

86
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,199
that they're also there to build trust
in police from an early age.

87
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,639
Do you think every school
should have a police officer at it?

88
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Unfortunately, yes, it's sad,
and if you think of it morbidly.

89
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:27,720
But, if you think of it building
relationships for our future…

90
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,319
Why not? It wouldn't hurt.

91
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,680
Wouldn't hurt?
Are you absolutely sure about that?

92
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,639
Because, little secret, if we are
showing you something on this show,

93
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,319
it could absolutely hurt.

94
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,519
There has never been a moment
where we've shown you a clip

95
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,319
where a cop goes, "Wouldn't hurt,"
and we've said,

96
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,040
"You're right, Officer Big Man,
it wouldn't!

97
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,720
Anyway, that's our show,
have a great weekend!"

98
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,959
So, given that once again, in the wake
of yet another school shooting,

99
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,279
we seem poised to throw more cops
into our schools, we thought tonight,

100
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,680
it'd be worth
talking about school police.

101
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,360
Whether they are the answer
to this particular problem,

102
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,959
the answer to any problems,

103
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,199
or whether they're actually
a pretty big problem themselves.

104
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,439
Let's start by acknowledging that this
idea isn't just coming from the NRA.

105
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,680
It's coming from parents, too,
like this man,

106
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,720
who back in February, showed up
at a county council meeting.

107
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,439
Alex Turner tells us he is all in favor
of the idea of adding SROs.

108
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:24,360
Just for the simple fact that they've
got a force multiplier in the school

109
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,720
where they could stop some imminent
threat to our children.

110
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,439
Turner has two young children,

111
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,319
and his wife works
at a school district in the county.

112
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,759
What scares me the most is the thought
of her having to use a backpack

113
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,079
to defend herself
from someone with a gun.

114
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,560
Our children are the most important
thing to our future.

115
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,639
They're future taxpayers,

116
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,199
they're future citizens that
are going to invest in our community.

117
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:56,399
Obviously that guy calling children
future taxpayers is a little bit weird.

118
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,600
Although who among us has not walked
into our sleeping child's room,

119
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,319
become overtaken
by the serenity on their face

120
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,279
and thought to ourselves,
"What a miracle."

121
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,120
"I wonder if she'll grow up
to file with a W-2 or a 1099."

122
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,199
"Parenthood truly
is a joyous mystery."

123
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,399
But I do get
what he's trying to say there.

124
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,319
The thought of someone
coming into a school

125
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:20,439
and hurting your child
is incredibly scary.

126
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:23,519
I don't think that all people
who believe that police officers

127
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,600
make schools safer have bad intentions
or are arguing in bad faith.

128
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,120
But I do believe
that they are wrong.

129
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,360
Because for the record,
the answer to the question,

130
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,439
"Do police in schools deter
school shootings?" is basically, "No."

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,279
Experts who've studied this
have found that school shooters

132
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,959
were not deterred due to the presence
of metal detectors, locked doors,

133
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,879
security cameras,
or school resource officers.

134
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,279
And if you're thinking,

135
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,040
"But what about when a shooting
is actually happening?

136
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,720
They could stop them then, right?"

137
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,120
Don't be so sure.
Famously, both Uvalde and Parkland

138
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:59,920
had school police officers and things
still went the way that they did.

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,920
Instances of school police stopping
shootings are actually incredibly rare.

140
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,759
There was one example
four years ago,

141
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,920
but when the Washington Post
looked into it after that,

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,879
they could only find one other case
in the preceding 19 years

143
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,800
where a resource officer
gunned down an active shooter.

144
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,079
It's much easier to find stories

145
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,959
of shootings stopped by faculty
and school counselors.

146
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,759
But rather than arguing
anecdote by anecdote,

147
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:27,120
it might be helpful
to look at the larger data.

148
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,360
Because on the whole, an analysis
of 179 shootings on school grounds,

149
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,240
which is a brutal thing
to say out loud on its own,

150
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,039
found no evidence that the presence
of school resource officers

151
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,559
lessened the severity
of school shootings.

152
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:46,399
If anything, they can actually make
it worse, as this researcher explains.

153
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,039
When we've looked at this,

154
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:51,399
and looked at school shootings
and attempted school shootings,

155
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,600
what's remarkable is that when you
have armed officers on the scene,

156
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,399
you actually see more casualties, often
because that perpetrator is suicidal.

157
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,519
They're familiar with that school,
they know that officer is there,

158
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,159
and so they come in heavily armed.

159
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,440
And if school cops
can make shootings worse,

160
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,559
why, then, are we still
pitching them as a solution?

161
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:17,440
If discovered that their mosquito
repellant attracted mosquitos,

162
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,080
they'd stop selling it.

163
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:23,480
Or, at the very least, rebrand it as a
cologne for lonely mosquito bachelors.

164
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,039
The evidence for cops in schools
deterring school shootings isn't there.

165
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,519
And the evidence for the damage
they can do is significant.

166
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,200
So, for the rest of this piece,
let's actually put shootings aside,

167
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,240
and consider the very real impact
that school police can have on kids,

168
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,799
every day that they are there.

169
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,799
The National Association
of School Resource Officers,

170
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:48,320
essentially,
the trade group for these officers,

171
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,519
will argue they serve many functions
in schools way beyond security.

172
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,759
They even developed a triad concept
of school policing,

173
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,279
that suggests an SRO
should simultaneously be

174
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,120
a "teacher, informal counselor,
and law enforcement officer."

175
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,759
And I will say,
there are undoubtedly schools

176
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,320
where some kids
see their police officers that way.

177
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,759
You've probably seen
videos of them

178
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,840
doing carpool karaoke
in their squad car with kids,

179
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,799
or doing a fun dance
at their halftime show.

180
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,080
Some have even joined kids
in extracurricular activities.

181
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,480
It's not every day
that you see the campus police officer

182
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,000
taking on the role of cast member
in the school musical.

183
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,279
She showed up at our first rehearsal,
our first dance rehearsal, I was like,

184
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:33,720
"Why is Officer Griffin here?
Is someone in trouble?"

185
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,600
But then everyone was like,

186
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,840
"No, she's joining the show.
She's gonna dance with us."

187
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:38,919
And I was shocked.

188
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,919
Shocked because prior to her
participation, most of these students

189
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,879
were intimidated by the officer tasked
with keeping order on campus.

190
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,320
It's true.
A cop was in the school musical.

191
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,480
Imagine how challenging
that casting decision

192
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,679
must have been
for the theater teacher.

193
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,639
"Susie has a fantastic vocal range,

194
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:01,159
Hannah B.
really learned the choreography,

195
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,639
Jillian's a senior, so it does feel
like it's her time to get a big role,

196
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,200
but Officer Griffin has a gun.

197
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,399
So, I guess I'm just going
to go with Officer Griffin."

198
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:16,360
But clearly, tap-dancing
Officer Griffin here is not the norm.

199
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,399
While school police
in more well-resourced schools

200
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,720
often do have an expanded role
including education and mentoring,

201
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,720
in disadvantaged schools,

202
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:29,080
they're more likely to engage primarily
in law enforcement activities.

203
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:32,320
And for all NASRO's talk
of the triad model,

204
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,919
when they asked their members which
prong they identify with the most,

205
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,679
over two-thirds
selected law enforcement.

206
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:41,559
Because of course they did.
They're cops.

207
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:46,559
Most cops don't get into copping
because they want to be counselors.

208
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,000
They do it
because movies make it look exciting

209
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,159
and they're tired of stopping
at red lights.

210
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,120
That's why they do it.
And the problem is,

211
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,759
faculty and school administrators
will sometimes use those cops

212
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,919
to deal with basic
disciplinary problems in the school,

213
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,440
as this teacher explains.

214
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:05,879
I see that teachers
have neglected to figure out

215
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,600
a way to handle a lot of problems
on their own that they used to.

216
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:12,519
Things that were up to the teacher
before are now just a phone call away.

217
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,559
How many of your peers
are just picking up the phone

218
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,960
and calling
the school resource officer?

219
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,120
I'd say the majority of teachers
are doing that.

220
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,519
Definitely 75 percent out of all of us,
if I just want to make a rough guess,

221
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,399
are doing that, because they go in
with a set lesson plan

222
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,039
and when the kid doesn't want to do it,
I get him out of the classroom.

223
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:35,440
Yeah, but that's not good. And I know
teachers have an exhausting job.

224
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,519
And, for some reason, society
has decided that their reward for that

225
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,840
is insultingly low pay
and occasional thank-you apples.

226
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,399
And it's not the point here,
but, why apples, exactly?

227
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,039
Why have we decided

228
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,480
to reward teachers the same way
we reward mediocre horses?

229
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:53,759
Because the good horses
get sugar cubes.

230
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,399
Am I saying teachers should get
sugar cubes instead of apples?

231
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm not not saying that,
but the larger point is,

232
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,519
while I understand a frustrated,
overworked teacher

233
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,519
wanting a troublemaking kid
out of their classroom,

234
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,919
involving the police in that is a very
dangerous impulse for many reasons.

235
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,879
One of them is, police in schools
can, and do, arrest students.

236
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:22,200
In the most recent year recorded,
they did this to over 54,000 of them,

237
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,279
which is a huge number.

238
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,399
If you asked me,

239
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,240
"What do you think happens
54,000 times inside schools?" I'd say,

240
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,320
"I dunno, the number of classroom pets
that went missing

241
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,360
because a student
left the lid off the cage"

242
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,320
or "The number of times a teacher
lost total control of her class

243
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,320
when any part of her private life
was revealed."

244
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,279
"My god, she had her computer
hooked up to the projector

245
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,720
and an e-vite from someone
named Jim appeared.

246
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:50,879
Who is Jim? Are you in love?
Will you have his babies?!"

247
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,320
And if you're thinking,

248
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,240
"A kid must be doing something
really bad to get arrested in school",

249
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,080
not really.

250
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,960
Students have been charged with
assault for throwing a paper airplane,

251
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:07,200
a baby carrot, and Skittles,

252
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,039
and drug possession
for carrying a maple leaf.

253
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,399
And when a "five-year-old
with ADHD had a tantrum",

254
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,639
they were charged
with "battery on a police officer",

255
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,600
when the only thing they were guilty
of was being a fucking five-yearold.

256
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,200
And take what happened
with Kiera Wilmot.

257
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,759
When she was a high school student,

258
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,360
she tried to replicate an experiment
that she'd seen in class,

259
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,039
where you set off a chemical reaction
in a plastic bottle

260
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,519
to make the cap blow off.

261
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,960
And I'll let her, and then her mother,
explain what happened next.

262
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,559
The principal and vice principal
were, like, about 10 feet away,

263
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:43,360
and when it popped, they came over
and asked what was going on,

264
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,000
I told them it was a science project
and they were just like, "Okay".

265
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,000
At the end of third period,
they take me out

266
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,120
and then walked me
to the resource officer.

267
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,440
He was like: "It's considered a felony.
I might have to arrest you for this."

268
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,399
And then I was just handcuffed
and put in the car.

269
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,679
A trained officer of the law arrested,
put my daughter in handcuffs,

270
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,720
put her in the back of a police car,

271
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,559
and took her
to the juvenile assessment center

272
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:18,600
and charged her
with two felony charges.

273
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,320
That is so fucking stupid
for so many reasons,

274
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,159
one of which is that when you hear
"felony for a science experiment",

275
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
you're thinking meth.

276
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,240
If I gave you 500 guesses
for what science experiment

277
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,919
got someone charged with a felony,
your first 499 guesses would be meth,

278
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,279
and the next one would be,
"Are you sure that it's not meth?"

279
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,440
Never in your wildest dreams
would it be popping a bottle cap.

280
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:47,440
Unless inside
that bottle was some meth.

281
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,440
I should say, the charges
against Kiera were later dropped.

282
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,279
But she still had to check the box
on her college application asking,

283
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,960
"Have you been arrested?"

284
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,519
And, as crazy as this sounds,
she was technically lucky,

285
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,240
in that at least she had press coverage
of her ridiculous arrest

286
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,279
that she could direct the college to.

287
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,600
But that is obviously not the case
for many, many others.

288
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:13,759
Kids with criminal records can have
a much harder time getting jobs,

289
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,320
scholarships, and a host
of other benefits and opportunities.

290
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,600
And while it's true that you can apply
to have your juvenile record sealed,

291
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:25,039
usually once you turn 18, there is
no guarantee that that will happen.

292
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,799
So, an arrest alone
can still do significant damage,

293
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:31,679
as some of those
involved in this system will admit.

294
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I think we certainly see a lot of cases
that we think, "Seriously?"

295
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,799
Garnette says
close to 70 percent of the time,

296
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:42,039
her probation officers decide
the offense isn't serious enough

297
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,840
to get referred to the district
attorney for criminal charges.

298
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:48,360
But even in those cases,
much of the damage is already done.

299
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,360
The child can still be left
with a criminal record?

300
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,600
It'll still show an arrest
on their rap sheet.

301
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,679
Yes, absolutely.
They've been arrested.

302
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,360
If the case comes to us,
they've been arrested,

303
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,360
whether they were put in handcuffs
and brought to us

304
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,160
or given a slip of paper by the police,
they've have been arrested.

305
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,519
And is that fair?

306
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,119
I mean…

307
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,440
I don't think it's fair.

308
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,200
That was a long pause!

309
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,440
And it's not a great sign
that a chief probation officer

310
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:23,920
is responding to the question
"Is the justice system fair?"

311
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,759
like they're stalling for time
on "Jeopardy!"

312
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,759
after accidentally buzzing in.

313
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,599
And I will say,
at least she is acknowledging there

314
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,839
that the system
has a significant problem.

315
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,960
What is absolutely maddening
is watching this former director

316
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,799
of student services
for the county where she works

317
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,559
try to make excuses for it.

318
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,000
No student
that's attending our campus

319
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,160
is getting a criminal record
because of something we've done.

320
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,359
We don't focus on arresting
or sending kids away.

321
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,160
That's completely counter
to what an educator should do.

322
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,720
- But that is what's happening.
- Not in my school district.

323
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,319
But in a single school year,

324
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,359
283 kids in your district
were referred to police.

325
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,960
- Okay…
- So, it is happening!

326
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:07,920
Kids are cited on our campuses
sometimes, yes.

327
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,480
And do you know that this can
give them a criminal record?

328
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,880
I know what happens
when I issue my own consequences.

329
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,119
I don't know what happens
when police issue their consequences.

330
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,640
So, you have no idea that these kids
are getting criminal records?

331
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,599
I wouldn't know
that one way or the other.

332
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,680
But don't you head discipline
for the district?

333
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,880
And I take care of discipline
for the district.

334
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:29,160
If consequences go beyond that
into the legal realm,

335
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,359
that's not our purview,
that's not our business.

336
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,000
Holy shit, that is selective.
Not your business?

337
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:39,960
No, my good bitch,
that is very much your business.

338
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,119
I do understand the distinction

339
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,599
hat budget Bill Murray
is trying to draw there.

340
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,920
There is school discipline,
which falls under his purview,

341
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,440
but if a kid breaks the law,
then it's a police thing.

342
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:54,400
But in practice, once you let
the police into your schools,

343
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,079
that line gets really blurry.

344
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,359
And you're going
to start getting stupid arrests

345
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,480
for things like science experiments,
or throwing baby carrots,

346
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,119
or, in the district
where that guy worked,

347
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,160
the indefensible arrest
of this autistic student.

348
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,480
Two years ago,
Adrian was at his school,

349
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,400
Bret Harte Middle in San Jose,

350
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,000
when he used a small rock to etch
the letters "ADRX" on the sidewalk.

351
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:21,400
The abbreviation is how Adrian often
signed his name on school assignments.

352
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,960
The letters measured six inches tall.
But the school believed

353
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,000
they were big enough a reason
to involve campus police.

354
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,680
Adrian was arrested at 13.

355
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,279
I thought maybe someone
would look at it and say,

356
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:40,920
"A legend that did this. It's so cool!
A legend was at this school".

357
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,160
For the record, that kid was,
and remains, a legend.

358
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:47,359
Because to 13-year-olds,

359
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,920
there is simply nothing cooler
than initials written somewhere.

360
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,599
It doesn't matter where,
or with what.

361
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,039
All that matters is that initials
are somewhere, and that is cool.

362
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,680
On a desk? Yes, please.
On a lamp post? I love it.

363
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,799
Way high up on a wall?
How did they get it up there?

364
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:07,920
We even put Adrian's initials
onto the set behind me

365
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,759
to make it absolutely clear to everyone
that a legend was very much here.

366
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,400
That story is completely bananas,
before you learn the letters he etched

367
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,480
came off with some soap and water
after his mother had him clean it up.

368
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,240
But it also speaks to a bigger issue,
students with disabilities

369
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,480
are almost three times
more likely to be arrested,

370
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:32,279
even though kids
with developmental disabilities

371
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:35,000
can have difficulty
understanding or following the rules

372
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:38,680
and require support staff
familiar with their specific needs.

373
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:42,039
And they are not the only students
disproportionately singled out.

374
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:44,880
Because cops in schools
do tend to behave

375
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,119
the same way they behave
outside of schools, which explains

376
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,039
why Black students account for nearly
a third of all students arrested,

377
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:55,319
despite the fact that that is
twice their share of enrollment.

378
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,279
That is just one reason why,

379
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,119
while you may hear a lot of white kids
talk about their friendly SRO,

380
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,039
Black students even in the same school
may see them very differently.

381
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:10,240
It was almost like this man
was judge, jury, and executioner.

382
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:12,480
And he was menacing-looking.

383
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,960
Literally, he walked through the halls
like he owned the place.

384
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:19,000
Every conversation
you had with him was tense.

385
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,119
It was literally
just students of color.

386
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,319
I don't think, even the Black SRO
that we had at Southwest,

387
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,519
I had never seen him
speak to a white student.

388
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:34,759
They knew who they were looking for,
they had their kids low-key terrorized.

389
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:38,680
There are so many students
who would've had a great time

390
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,519
but had a horrible time because
of an SRO or because of a cop.

391
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,240
The presence of police can make
school miserable for some kids,

392
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:52,799
and we frankly don't need
any more ways to make school scarier.

393
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,279
It's already terrifying enough.

394
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:57,839
If you asked me what is the
scariest place I can imagine,

395
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,559
it's not a haunted house
or the inside of Tom Cruise's brain.

396
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:06,440
It's high school.
Because remember, I was this.

397
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,240
And it's not
just low-key terrorizing.

398
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:16,119
You may be familiar with viral videos
of school cops behaving violently,

399
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,599
videos that sometimes went on
to make awful headlines like these.

400
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,799
Because cops in schools enjoy all the
protections they do everywhere else,

401
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,960
the consequences in many
of these cases can be nonexistent.

402
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:30,480
In Osceola County, Florida,
an officer was filmed

403
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,359
"throwing a female student to the
floor" knocking her unconscious.

404
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,160
But he wasn't charged
with any wrongdoing.

405
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,880
And his supervisor, the county sheriff,
fully supported that outcome.

406
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,160
A lot of things are never going to look
pretty on camera, but guess what?

407
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,480
This worked out, and it's a positive
thing for law enforcement.

408
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,200
Sheriff Lopez
defending Deputy Fournier's actions,

409
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:55,680
despite criticism
and public scrutiny.

410
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:59,279
It's unfortunate that the young lady
went through this incident,

411
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,680
but it's also unfortunate

412
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:07,000
that my deputy had to suffer a lot
of constant bashing and harassment,

413
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,519
when he just did
with how he was trained.

414
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:13,160
I honestly think
no one makes a better case

415
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,039
for defunding the police
than the police themselves.

416
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:17,720
If throwing a kid to the ground

417
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:21,519
and then having your boss complain
about how everyone was rude to you

418
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,880
is emblematic of how you were trained,
then the problem is the training,

419
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,279
the cops themselves,
the entire system and, not for nothing,

420
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:31,440
that sheriff's
fake Oakley sunglasses.

421
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:36,480
But the sheriff of Flavortown here
does raise an interesting point.

422
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,880
School police get trained as cops,

423
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,720
but that might be
the only training they get.

424
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,319
Because requirements vary widely
in each state, if they exist at all.

425
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:50,279
And national training requirements
for school-based law enforcement

426
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:52,559
simply do not exist.

427
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,119
And when you've got law enforcement
stationed in a school,

428
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,720
taking ordinary disciplinary situations
and escalating them,

429
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,880
the consequences, as you have seen
tonight, can be truly terrible.

430
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,880
In researching this piece,
we found so many stories

431
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,160
where kids are still traumatized
by the experiences that they had,

432
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,400
even years later, and felt it both
changed the trajectory of their lives,

433
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,599
and how they interact
with the world.

434
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,839
If you are over a certain age,

435
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,799
this is so much more prevalent
than you might think.

436
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,559
We don't have
a particularly large staff,

437
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,079
but multiple members of it
have come forward

438
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,039
as we put this story together
this week,

439
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:30,720
citing terrible behavior
by school police

440
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,359
they'd either directly witnessed
or experienced first-hand.

441
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,880
And we're not even getting
into the fact that schools with SROs

442
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,000
have higher rates
of exclusionary discipline,

443
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,160
things like suspensions
and expulsions,

444
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,839
than comparable schools
without SROs,

445
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,559
which has been shown
to be associated with

446
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,559
"lower academic achievement,
dropout,

447
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,519
and increased behavioral problems
both in and out of school".

448
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,240
When that guy that you saw earlier
argued for more police in every school,

449
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:58,599
saying, "Why not? It wouldn't hurt",
the answer to that is:

450
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,440
"It absolutely can,
and it does, all the time".

451
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,359
For all the arguing right now about
how we need more police in schools,

452
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,440
I would argue that we may
actually need significantly less.

453
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,519
And small reforms
are not going to cut it here.

454
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:18,039
Some places have tried that, with
tactics that kept the police in schools

455
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:20,680
but tried to make them appear
less intimidating.

456
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:22,880
About five years ago,
some districts in Minnesota,

457
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,599
where that kid went to school,

458
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,759
redesigned their school police
uniforms to light-blue polo shirts.

459
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:30,279
Something that, unsurprisingly,

460
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:33,119
students there, including him,
saw right through.

461
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:37,359
Every day, I go to school
as a young Black male teen,

462
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,160
and I have to see our SRO
just wandering the hallways.

463
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,680
He's always in our classrooms.
He's always in the hallways.

464
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,359
Your compromise
is to give them softer outfits?

465
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,079
That doesn't make sense.

466
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,400
At the end of the day,
a cop is a cop.

467
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,880
Whether you dress them up in red,
yellow, blue, it doesn't matter.

468
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:59,359
He's right.
Teenagers aren't stupid.

469
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:03,000
You can't send the cop uniform
to a farm upstate.

470
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:04,640
They know what is going on.

471
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,119
A cop is gonna be a cop,
no matter what we dress them up in.

472
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,440
Fuchsia? Still a cop.
Vermillion? Still a cop.

473
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,759
Cher's dress from the 1986 Oscars?
Still a cop.

474
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,480
And now they're wearing something

475
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,519
they couldn't pull off
in their wildest fucking dreams.

476
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:21,920
There are some slightly
bigger steps that we could take,

477
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,880
like demanding school districts
adopt rules

478
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,680
that keep cops
out of routine student discipline.

479
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:29,200
And we could also require
that they have comprehensive training

480
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,960
that includes de-escalation and working
with students with disabilities.

481
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,440
Or we could just try
and get them out of schools altogether.

482
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:40,519
Some cities, like Oakland, California,
have done that.

483
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,440
And I am not saying it is simple.

484
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,519
There is still a thoughtful,
ongoing conversation there

485
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,480
about how to handle routine discipline
or emergency situations.

486
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:52,279
Because they know
getting rid of school police

487
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:55,039
doesn't mean walking away
from school safety.

488
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,680
What it means is asking ourselves
what really keeps kids safe.

489
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,279
And I would argue that one good wa
to do that might be to take the money

490
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:07,200
that it seems we're now inevitably
about to flood towards school cops,

491
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,359
and instead direct it
toward counselors, nurses,

492
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,599
and all the other resources
that actually protect students.

493
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,599
School police are not the answer
to school shootings.

494
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,000
The answer to that is gun control.

495
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,240
When we throw more cops
into schools

496
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:26,920
as an easy way out of that difficult
and necessary conversation,

497
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,880
we not only fail to keep our kids
safe from gun violence,

498
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,000
we condemn them

499
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:35,200
to a system that criminalizes
the very essence of childhood.

500
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,839
Kids deserve to be annoying
without being arrested,

501
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,759
to be sad and angry
without being body-slammed.

502
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:46,480
They deserve to have tantrums,
throw carrots, do science experiments,

503
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,119
talk shit,
and carve their name into stuff

504
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,279
without risking ending up
in the back of a police car.

505
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:54,279
They deserve to be curious,
to make mistakes,

506
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:57,079
to go a little too far,
to be a little too loud.

507
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,279
To basically be a fucking kid.

508
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:03,400
And they definitely deserve
better than the fundamental lie

509
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,799
that the only thing that can stop
a bad guy with a gun

510
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,960
is a good guy
who can arrest a five-year-old.

511
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,480
And now, this.

512
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:13,440
And now…

513
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:18,119
People on TV Get a Little Too
British for the Platinum Jubilee.

514
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,759
Welcome back to Fox 5 News
live in Las Vegas.

515
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:26,839
I am your British correspondent,
Ken Smith here.

516
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,519
Good morning, everybody,
or should I say, cheerio, you chaps.

517
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:32,880
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio to you, too.

518
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,319
- Cheerio. Pop, pop, pop.
- Cheerio!

519
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,160
Hello, governor!

520
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,599
- Let's go across the pond.
- Across the pond?

521
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,599
Across the pond, we've got
to make sure our posture's okay.

522
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,079
- Okay. Cheerio.
- We're going to celebrate the Queen.

523
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,559
The Platinum Jubilee.

524
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,720
So, does that mean that Deena will read
the news in her accent tomorrow?

525
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:52,079
- Gosh, I hope not.
- I'll use the accent all morning.

526
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,240
So good!

527
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:55,400
Going to wait for our tea
and crumpets this morning.

528
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,720
A spot of tea.

529
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,119
As we watch our Queen
do her celebrations.

530
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,759
I'm not the best,
but sometimes I kick into it, so.

531
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:03,079
- A for effort.
- My bad.

532
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:05,920
That's like Mrs. Doubtfire.

533
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,319
- Hello! That's all I have.
- That's Mrs. Doubtfire.

534
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,000
Just do the rest of the show
in a British accent.

535
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:13,119
I don't think I can.

536
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,680
There are questions about whether she
will be able to attend her celebration.

537
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:18,759
What, why?

538
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,680
It's because of health issues,
so I'm going to drop the accent.

539
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,480
Moving on. I know this has been
a very grim couple of weeks,

540
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,799
so before we leave, we wanted to talk
about something that's just fun.

541
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,799
Specifically, bananas.
The very worst part of a banana split.

542
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,400
The reason I want to do that
is that there is actually some urgent,

543
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,160
breaking news about bananas.

544
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,000
To be honest,
it's not really urgent.

545
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,359
Or breaking, this happened last
November. It's barely even news.

546
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,119
But it is something
that I do want to show you,

547
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,319
mainly because
it is simply amazing.

548
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,160
Vandals have attempted to sever

549
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,960
the top of a controversial banana
and skull sculpture in Fitzroy.

550
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:02,599
The vandal appeared out of nowhere
last night,

551
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:06,599
concealing his identity,
his motive unknown.

552
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:10,480
Yeah, that happened.
A giant Australian banana

553
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,119
in a Melbourne suburb
was vandalized with a saw.

554
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,319
And by the way, what a banana!

555
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,960
It's basically the Cate Blanchett
of banana sculptures,

556
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,839
in that it's a hauntingly pale
Australian creature

557
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,839
with a very striking bone structure.

558
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:26,720
And if you're wondering,
"Who would do a thing like this?"

559
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,279
It turns out, a lot of people
there had a motive,

560
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:32,279
because this banana
was not universally beloved.

561
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,160
The controversial
$22,000 dollar work

562
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,920
highlighting climate change
was funded by the TAC,

563
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:44,440
part of a council project
to slow local traffic.

564
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:50,519
Even in quirky Fitzroy,
this banana split local opinion.

565
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,400
Brightens up the place.
It looks good.

566
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,200
I think our money
can be spent a lot wiser.

567
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,119
What is that supposed to represent?
Could you tell me?

568
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,720
Yeah, people were pissed off
with that banana.

569
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,079
And it is true,
the aim of the sculpture

570
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,680
was that it would remind
the community

571
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:08,359
about road safety
by forcing people to slow down.

572
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,160
Although I would argue that this
is less of a reminder to slow down,

573
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,240
and more an encouragement
to speed up

574
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:18,559
in order to get away from this demonic
fucking banana as soon as possible.

575
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,119
But as for this woman's question,
"What is it supposed to represent?"

576
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,000
We can actually help answer
that for you.

577
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:26,480
The sculpture
is entitled "Fallen Fruit",

578
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,119
and according to the artist,
the piece represents…

579
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,799
This idea of hubris or overconfidence
within our western society

580
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:37,759
and the way that we've been drawn
towards kind of unsustainable excess.

581
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,279
That is not the statement that
I thought that banana was making!

582
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,480
The statement I thought it was making
is, "I am a big, weird banana".

583
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,799
I was clearly way off there.

584
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,799
Sadly, the banana
was removed after the vandalism,

585
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,559
and was recently replaced
by this giant yellow flower pot,

586
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,480
which is clearly
not even close to as good.

587
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:03,279
And there is now no sign of
whether the banana will ever be back.

588
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:06,279
Which is a huge shame.
Because what is the real problem here?

589
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:10,200
It's not like Australia isn't full
of ridiculous, enormous statues.

590
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:13,640
There's actually a proud tradition
of Australian big things,

591
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,640
gigantic sculptures of common objects,
like The Big Banana,

592
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,599
which demonstrably
lives up to its name.

593
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,000
This giant koala bear,
who looks absolutely mortified.

594
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:29,000
And this massive crocodile
with boxing gloves whose role

595
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:32,559
is to entice tourists to visit
the very real town of Humpty Doo,

596
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:36,319
a statement so offensively Australian

597
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,519
that, if it were not true,
it would actually be racist.

598
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,960
But since the citizens of Melbourne

599
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,160
seem to think
that their money has been wasted,

600
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,400
I might have a solution for you.

601
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,440
Because I will gladly
take that banana off your hands.

602
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:52,599
We have long had an interest
in Australian artifacts on this show.

603
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,119
You may remember that we bought
Russell Crowe's jockstrap

604
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,400
from the movie "Cinderella Man"
at his divorce auction,

605
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,759
inadvertently funding the John Oliver
Koala Chlamydia Ward at the Zoo.

606
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:04,519
I promise,
it all made sense at the time.

607
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,680
The point here is, Melbourne,
I am willing to buy

608
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:12,119
that giant banana off you
for exactly 10 Australian dollars.

609
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,240
Plus a $10,000 donation
to your local food bank,

610
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:21,039
and $5,000 to help further fund
the Koala Chlamydia Ward.

611
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,839
But, wait, I'm not even done.

612
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,200
Because you may also remember
that we, too,

613
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,400
have a statue of a large,
belligerent reptile.

614
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,839
Ours is an alligator giving the finger
that we made for our confederacy show.

615
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,240
It has been sitting in our offices,
pointed directly at Dr. Oz's offices,

616
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:40,440
so it could tell him to go fuck himself
when he came to work every day.

617
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,559
But as he is now gone,
and as of this week,

618
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,400
is the official Republican Senate
nominee in Pennsylvania,

619
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,920
we don't really need
our alligator anymore.

620
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:53,119
Which brings me to our full offer.
Because Melbourne,

621
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:57,079
I believe I have the replacement
statue that you are looking for.

622
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:01,000
If you take us up on our deal,
we will make those donations

623
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:05,519
and, as a sweetener,
send you this magnificent creature,

624
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,400
on a ship.

625
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,440
And frankly,
I think it'd fit right in there.

626
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:14,440
What could be more Australian
than a dangerous animal

627
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,760
telling anyone who comes near it
to go fuck themselves?

628
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:21,400
So, if you take us up on our offer,
this guy is yours, Melbourne.

629
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:26,199
You have exactly one week to get
back to us. Send us your banana!

630
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,039
That is our show.
We'll see you next week, good night!
