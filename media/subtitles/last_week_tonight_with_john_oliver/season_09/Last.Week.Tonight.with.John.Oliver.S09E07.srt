00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,480
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,719
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight"!
I'm John Oliver.

3
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:36,759
Thank you so much for joining us.
It has been another busy week.

4
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,039
The Senate confirmed Ketanji
Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court,

5
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,880
Elon Musk
joined the board of Twitter,

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,560
presumably to innovate new ways
to make it even worse,

7
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,799
and the Russian invasion of Ukraine
continued to escalate,

8
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,280
with reports of unfathomable horrors,
strongly suggesting war crimes,

9
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,719
if not genocide.

10
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:57,240
I know this is allegedly
a comedy show,

11
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,079
and I have said the most upsetting
collection of words

12
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,920
since "Louis C.K. wins Grammy
for best comedy album."

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,760
But we do need to at least briefly deal
with what is going on in Ukraine,

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,799
and particularly Bucha, site of some of
the worst images to emerge this week.

15
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,719
Because Russian state TV
is going out of its way not to.

16
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,599
Here is how one broadcaster there

17
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,120
spun those terrible images
of bodies in the streets.

18
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:23,599
There are people on the screen

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,040
that are lying dead in the street
with white armbands.

20
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,239
What does that mean? It means
that after Russian forces left Bucha,

21
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:35,280
the so-called liberators came in and
they simply killed peaceful civilians.

22
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,280
On the screen, people are moving. That
means that actors were also involved.

23
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,519
A conclusion out of all of this is
that to achieve their media goals,

24
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:47,719
the Ukrainian Kyiv regime
killed its own people.

25
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,280
So that man's official argument is
Ukrainians killed their own civilians,

26
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,920
who aren't civilians, they're actors
who were just pretending to be dead,

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,840
and the Ukrainian government itself

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,920
is responsible for the real slaughter
of its own fake civilians.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,040
That is obviously ridiculous, and
also ignores the first rule of lying:

30
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,840
don't over-complicate.

31
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,479
There is a reason the line is,

32
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,479
"I definitely have a girlfriend,
she just goes to another school",

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,960
and not, "I definitely have
a girlfriend, she's actually twins,

34
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,879
sometimes they merge
and become one really big girl,

35
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,520
I'd invite you to come over
and meet them,

36
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,319
but that might be confusing,
because I am you from the future."

37
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:26,479
Russian state TV has been grasping
at straws all week,

38
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,960
with a presenter
at one point arguing,

39
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:31,120
as evidence that Bucha
was the site of a false flag attack,

40
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,840
that "Biden said that Putin
is a butcher.

41
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,719
Bucha sounds like 'butcher.'

42
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,719
How could they not take advantage
of such a town?"

43
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,960
Which is just insane.

44
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,879
If bad things only happened in
places with names that sounded scary,

45
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,800
all of America's worst shit would
be happening in Tombstone, Arizona,

46
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,840
Cape Fear, North Carolina,
or Hell, Michigan,

47
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,000
and not where it actually happens,
Tallahassee, Florida.

48
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:59,280
But this flagrant lying is consistent
with how Russia's state media

49
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,560
has been dealing
with this war from the beginning.

50
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,560
At first, they refused to even
acknowledge that there was a war,

51
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,360
let alone address casualties.

52
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,360
Just watch what happened
last month

53
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:11,479
when a military officer
merely mentioned Russian deaths.

54
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,000
Our guys are really out there,
both Donetsk and Luhansk (forces),

55
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,000
and our special operation forces,
they're dying now.

56
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,439
And our country...

57
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:24,280
No! I don't want to hear this!
Wait!

58
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,159
- They're dying anyway!
- Stop!

59
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,000
- They're dying anyway!
- Can't you stop, or what?

60
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,800
I just want us to stand up now

61
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,360
and honor their memories
at least with a minute of silence.

62
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,919
What are you doing?

63
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,800
Our boys that are still fighting over
there for Russia and for the Donbas.

64
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,439
Can you stop now?

65
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,879
Close call there! Russian viewers
almost learned that their troops

66
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,719
were being killed until that host
jumped up and screamed,

67
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,919
"Whoa, ix-nay
on the asualties-cay".

68
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,439
Some truly grade-A
propaganda work there

69
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,680
from the network
that brought you

70
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,000
"Shut Up About
Vladimir Putin's Election Fraud"

71
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,680
and "Poisoning Opponents?
I Can't Hear You."

72
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:04,000
It seems Russia
is determined to deny the obvious

73
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,520
and to justify
the indefensible here.

74
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,120
But that is getting increasingly hard
to do.

75
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:11,919
And if you think
"those bodies are actually actors"

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,879
is as pathetic as it got this week,

77
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,839
just listen to Rossiya 24's
ridiculous explanation.

78
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,639
This is how the preparation
for performance, literally,

79
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,360
of military actions in Ukraine
is taking place.

80
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,639
As you can see,
it's quite uncomplicated.

81
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:31,480
Two people in military uniforms
carefully wrap the mannequin with tape,

82
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,279
obviously, they are going
to pass it off as a corpse.

83
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,839
That is clearly absurd, not only are
the Ukrainian casualties obviously real

84
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,600
that footage turned out to be
part of a TV drama

85
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,240
being filmed
near St. Petersburg last month.

86
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,800
If you're wondering which TV show,
it's "Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist."

87
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:51,319
What can I say?
Russian audiences really connect

88
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:54,560
with the story of a woman forced
to hallucinate a more joyful existence.

89
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,240
And there will be more to say about
the Ukrainian situation as it develops.

90
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:03,759
But for now, let's move to a much less
consequential story concerning OAN,

91
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:06,199
the network with a logo that looks
like it belongs on the side of a truck

92
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,360
transporting refrigerator parts.

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,720
We've talked about OAN
a few times over the years,

94
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,199
primarily because they were
Trump's favorite news outlet,

95
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,879
as well as a perpetual source
of misinformation about Covid

96
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,560
and platform for pillow prince Mike
Lindell's election-fraud documentary

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,120
"Absolute Proof".

98
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,759
And yes,
I am using the word "documentary" there

99
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,720
with Christlike generosity.

100
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,199
This was a big week for OAN,

101
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:33,480
although not in a good way,
as one of their anchors explained.

102
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
Come Monday,

103
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,560
you will no longer see One America
News on a certain satellite provider,

104
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,000
which I will not mention

105
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,720
because I don't even like uttering
their name out of my mouth.

106
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,839
Ah, yes, the hallmark
of a great news network,

107
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,759
bringing you hard-hitting
news stories

108
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:52,600
without specifics
because they make the anchor sad.

109
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,199
The provider that he's referring
to there is DirecTV,

110
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,439
which is a subsidiary
of a parent company I will not mention

111
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:03,839
because I don't even like uttering
their name out of my mouth.

112
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,560
Interestingly, as of Friday,
AT&T officially no longer owns us,

113
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,959
so it is goodbye from me,
business daddy.

114
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,560
And let me say this, which is frankly
two more bars than you have ever had.

115
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:21,519
Now, as we've mentioned before,
AT&T was instrumental in OAN's rise,

116
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,720
with about 90% of its revenue
reportedly generated

117
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,160
from its AT&T
and DirecTV deals.

118
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,240
But this past week, OAN
was finally dropped by the provider,

119
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,800
and not a moment too soon.

120
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,560
Its coverage of Ukraine, in particular,
has been appalling,

121
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,800
with this fucking guy suggesting that
this bombing of a maternity hospital

122
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,360
might have been a hoax.

123
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:47,160
So, what's the most recent story
cooked up by the American Pravda?

124
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:51,920
It turns out that the Russians,
Democrats' favorite adversary,

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,959
blew up a hospital, killing
several people, including a child.

126
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,639
Perhaps war crimes
are being committed,

127
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,879
perhaps civilians
are being murdered,

128
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,759
but perhaps they aren't.

129
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:11,120
It is pretty maddening
to watch neo-fascist Vin Diesel there

130
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,399
question civilian casualties

131
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,560
with the tone of a stoned teenager
talking about penguins.

132
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,519
"Perhaps they're wearing
little bird tuxedos,

133
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,279
but perhaps... they aren't?"

134
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,240
Losing distribution on DirecTV
is clearly a big blow to OAN,

135
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:32,000
and they are not going out
without a fight,

136
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:37,879
as their owners are currently suing
AT&T and DirecTV for $1 billion,

137
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,680
claiming at one point in the suit
that AT&T

138
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:43,720
breached a "non-disparagement
provision" in their contract,

139
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,120
because shows the company
owned had been critical of them.

140
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,600
And here is where things
get a bit fun.

141
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,639
Because it turns out,
we're actually in that lawsuit.

142
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:56,759
It cites a number of things
that I said about OAN in the past,

143
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:00,800
like the fact they are "Fox News with
less shame and even fewer scruples,"

144
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,000
and a "ragtag band of fascists"

145
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,879
who are "happy to give a platform
to batshit election fraud theories

146
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,040
from America's most out-of-breath
pillow fetishist."

147
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,120
And while I am truly happy
to have said all of those things,

148
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,720
I cannot believe
that they left out the fact

149
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,120
that I also called this guy
"decaf Pitbull" just last year,

150
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,600
and frankly, I want that entered
into the legal record.

151
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:26,759
And look,
I do get that they are upset here.

152
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,079
Just as I get that they are an
intellectually bankrupt organization

153
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,559
full of grifters who've done nothing
but make this country a worse place.

154
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,440
But perhaps
this isn't the time for that.

155
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:40,080
And perhaps I am sorry
for taking joy in their misfortune

156
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,440
and kicking them
when they are so clearly down.

157
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,960
But on the other hand,
perhaps I am not.

158
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
And now, this!

159
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,200
And Now: Things Get Uncomfortable
on Local News

160
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,600
Thanks to a Terrible Holiday.

161
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,080
Allegedly,
it's National Hug a Newsperson Day.

162
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:01,480
My goodness.
I'm good, fam. I'm good.

163
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:04,039
I am also good.
I don't want anything.

164
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,279
Today is National
Hug a Newsperson Day.

165
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:14,279
Or don't. I guess. Apparently.

166
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,399
Jackie, is there anyone you really
want to give a hug to?

167
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,440
First of all, I hate hugs.
You know that. I hate hugs.

168
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,679
I was like, I'm going to give you,
and then I remembered. Yeah.

169
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,159
So much! I hate hugs.
So much, like, even with my family.

170
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,039
- Am I ever going to hug you?
- No, do not...

171
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,320
Today is National Hug
a Newsperson Day.

172
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,399
Just don't come up and hug
somebody you don't know.

173
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,000
- Just don't hug you?
- I don't know you.

174
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,519
- Hug a Newsperson Day.
- You made that up.

175
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,759
- I did not make that up!
- Did you find it on a bogus website?

176
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:44,480
- What are you doing?
- I'm warming up my hugging muscles.

177
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,159
Who are you hugging?

178
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,960
Maybe Patrick will get a hug today
from Krista, we'll see.

179
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,320
I don't think he'd want one.

180
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,399
Who knows? Justin got one last hour,
but that was an interesting one.

181
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,200
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns computers.

182
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:03,240
There's one in my house,
one in my pocket, and one on my wrist,

183
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,399
and, fun fact, if they all broke
at the same time, I'd die!

184
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,200
More specifically,
we're going to talk about the fact

185
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,159
that we've all had unsettling moments
when it became clear

186
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,799
that our computer
was monitoring our activities

187
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:17,039
a little more closely
than we might like.

188
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,080
After financial planner Rod Laurenz
opened a new office,

189
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:24,559
he used a credit card to buy baby wipes
to clean the place.

190
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,159
He says after picking up
just one canister,

191
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,519
he was shocked to be bombarded
with targeted online ads

192
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,440
for other baby wipes
and more children's products,

193
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,720
something this single guy
around town

194
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:38,799
says he's definitely not interested in,
at least not now.

195
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,519
Yeah, it's true. Poor Rod got roped
into the modern update

196
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,240
of Hemingway's classic story,
"For sale. Baby shoes. Click here."

197
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:51,039
Of course Rod didn't want that shit.
He was a man about town!

198
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,679
He was only interested in three things:
getting laids, getting paids,

199
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,600
and rocking the hell
out of some wrap-around shades.

200
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,559
But we have all found ourselves
being targeted by ads

201
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,759
for something
oddly specific and thought,

202
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,600
"How on earth did
they know to show me that?"

203
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:09,759
And tonight, we're going to talk
about who makes that possible:

204
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,840
data brokers.

205
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,679
It's a multibillion-dollar industry,

206
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:15,720
encompassing everyone
from credit-reporting companies,

207
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:18,840
to these weird people-finding websites
that pop up

208
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:22,000
whenever you Google the name
of your friend's sketchy new boyfriend,

209
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,840
to these names
that you may never have heard of.

210
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:27,480
But what all these companies
have in common is,

211
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:31,879
they collect your personal information
and resell or share it with others.

212
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,559
As one expert puts it, they're the
"middlemen of surveillance capitalism."

213
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,240
Which sounds
like both a horrific profession

214
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,279
and also,
a B-plus Jake Gyllenhaal thriller.

215
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,960
He's not a spy, and he's not a civilian.
He's the middleman.

216
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,639
And ladies?
In this one, he shows trunk.

217
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,919
I know it is not news
that you get tracked online.

218
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,879
In fact,
roughly six in 10 U.S. adults

219
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,840
say that they don't think
it is possible to go through daily life

220
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,320
"without having data collected about
them by companies or the government,"

221
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:06,440
making four out of 10
U.S. adults embarrassingly wrong.

222
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:12,039
But this isn't about the convenience
and/or irritation of targeted ads.

223
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,320
Data brokers operate in a sprawling,
unregulated ecosystem,

224
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,120
which can get very creepy,
very fast.

225
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,759
The major U.S. retailer
OfficeMax

226
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,879
new not only that Mike Seay's
daughter was dead,

227
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
but how she died.

228
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,720
It says, "Mike Seay, Daughter Killed
in Car Crash or Current Business",

229
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,399
and this is my home.

230
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,320
Why would they have
that kind of information?

231
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,759
Why would they need that?

232
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,000
Right, and obviously
that is completely appalling.

233
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,720
But I will say,
it is not that surprising to me

234
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,639
that OfficeMax was behind that,

235
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,600
as they're clearly not entirely
on top of their shit.

236
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,679
If you Google "OfficeMax"
right now,

237
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,720
the "people also ask" questions
include, and this is true,

238
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:55,120
"Is OfficeMax
the same as Office Depot?"

239
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,840
"Is OfficeMax and Staples the same?"
and "Does OfficeMax exist?"

240
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,559
The truth is,
when it comes to data brokers,

241
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:06,559
they know significantly more
about you than you might like,

242
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,919
and do significantly more with it
than you might think.

243
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,600
So tonight,
let's talk about the whole industry.

244
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:15,480
And let's start with how
your information is collected.

245
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:18,200
Basically, every time
you interact with society,

246
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:22,120
you are leaving little breadcrumbs
that can be gathered together and sold.

247
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,919
And much of this happens online,
thanks in large part to cookies.

248
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,559
Cookies were developed
in the early days of the internet,

249
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,600
and they're actually one of the things
that make it slightly better,

250
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:32,960
a distinction that they share

251
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,440
with Henry Winkler's Twitter feed
and literally nothing else.

252
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,440
What they essentially do is enable
websites to remember you.

253
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,159
They are why Amazon remembers

254
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,639
that you put a $106 complete box set
of "The Mentalist" in your cart

255
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,759
after eating an unexpectedly strong
weed gummy, even if you don't.

256
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,320
And if that's all cookies did,
it'd honestly be fine.

257
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,960
But the practice gradually evolved
to include third-party cookies,

258
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:01,080
basically, companies other than
the site that you are on,

259
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,320
planting a piece of code
in your browser

260
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:06,440
that allows them to track where else
you are going on the internet.

261
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:09,000
Just watch as a tech writer
explains what they found

262
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,799
when they tried to learn just how
many companies were tracking them.

263
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,759
So, I started the day on Google
and did a search.

264
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,399
And nine trackers were downloaded
onto my computer.

265
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,679
Trackers do what it sounds
like they do. They track you.

266
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,279
They can get my IP address or the
device I'm using, or the screen size.

267
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,279
They were able to determine
my location very precisely.

268
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,600
Next, I went to HuffPo,
and I was swarmed.

269
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:36,559
The trackers kind of multiplied.
There were dozens and dozens.

270
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:40,879
And the trackers are just kind of,
you know, on my heels

271
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,480
as I go around the web.

272
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,759
And I don't know about you, but I
don't want a whole crowd of strangers

273
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,360
watching what I search for
on the internet.

274
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,600
Not because it's gross. It's private.
Private doesn't have to mean gross.

275
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,200
There's nothing gross
about looking up, let's say,

276
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,399
"Are there any showerheads
with a 'contains pulp' option?"

277
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:02,759
I wouldn't want it all the time,
I wouldn't need it all the time.

278
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,679
That's why it's an option.
The option to have some pulp.

279
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,399
In the shower.
It's, can I finish?

280
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,320
It's a normal shower most
of the time, but occasionally

281
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,919
I'll have the option to get pelted with
something that's got some heft to it.

282
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,200
Just some weighted chunks
of whatever.

283
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,799
Something to wake me up
and keep me on my toes.

284
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,840
Sometimes I need it,
don't claim that you don't.

285
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:27,039
We'd all love to pretend
that the sun only rises in peacetime,

286
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,879
but things being what they are,
we find ourselves again at war.

287
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,559
So, yeah, start my day and rock me
with some juicy bits.

288
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,039
That's what I want.
And I don't want anyone watching me

289
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,519
when I search to see how close we are
to that particular technology existing,

290
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,399
because it is private.

291
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,519
But data brokers
often take all the breadcrumbs

292
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,559
that they have gathered about you,
pair them with other data they obtain,

293
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,120
and then share all of it with
businesses who want to market to you.

294
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,279
And they will frame this
as a win-win.

295
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,279
Here is how Epsilon, one of the biggest
data-broker firms, positions itself.

296
00:15:58,919 --> 00:15:59,960
This is a person.

297
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,399
So is this. Here's another.
And another.

298
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:07,519
They all look and act different,
but people are fundamentally the same.

299
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,120
They all want respect, protection,

300
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,440
and an easier time getting the things
they need from brands.

301
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,519
Right! The big three!

302
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:18,080
It's all in Maslow's
famous hierarchy of needs,

303
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,000
people want their physiological
needs met, their safety accounted for,

304
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,559
and their search history handed over
directly to the Aflac Duck.

305
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,279
Epsilon's ad even goes on to show
how that service of theirs works,

306
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,759
demonstrating how they can create
a client ID

307
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,120
for someone that contains
everything they know about them,

308
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,240
like the fact they're a vegan and
that they make 45 to $50,000 a year,

309
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,159
or that they are a 41-year-old male
who is married with kids at home

310
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,480
and is Googling "snow globe stuck
in butt, what to do, question mark."

311
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,159
Once companies like Epsilon collect
enough information about you,

312
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,080
they can sort you into groups.

313
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:56,679
Data broker firms sell access
to lists with names like

314
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:00,639
"couples with clout," "ambitious
singles," "boomers and boomerangs,"

315
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,559
"potlucks and the great outdoors,"
"golf carts and gourmets,"

316
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,079
and "kids and cabernet."

317
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,519
Those are all both real names
of groups compiled by a data broker

318
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:14,200
and, as of now, immediately
greenlit shows on TLC.

319
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,160
And, look, you might not care if
a company wants to toss your data

320
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,279
in a group
called "kids and cabernet"

321
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,920
so marketers can more
effectively sell you things

322
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,319
that make you seem
like a bad mom in a fun way,

323
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,359
but there is also a dark side here.

324
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,519
Because some companies can,
and do,

325
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:34,160
draw up even more narrowly
targeted lists,

326
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,000
like people with certain ailments,
or sexual preferences,

327
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,000
and then sell those lists
to anyone who wants to buy them.

328
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:43,599
And what they can buy
is pretty troubling.

329
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:47,440
WRAL bought thousands
of names and addresses

330
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,920
of local people
with serious illnesses.

331
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,960
This group living
in the 27607 ZIP code have diabetes.

332
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,319
These people in 27608
have cancer.

333
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:01,559
These residents of 27609
have high blood pressure.

334
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,119
And all of these locals
battle depression.

335
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,279
This list is moms-to-be.

336
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,960
So, we bought this data,
and it tells us you're pregnant.

337
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,160
- Yes.
- And you are?

338
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,400
Yeah, I am 18 weeks.

339
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,039
That's pretty creepy, isn't it?

340
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,400
I honestly did not think
there could be a worse thing

341
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,079
to ask a woman you don't know
than "are you pregnant?"

342
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,039
But "you are pregnant,
wanna know who I paid to find out?"

343
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:27,279
has certainly entered the chat.

344
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,200
And if you're thinking, "But
that's illegal under HIPAA, right?"

345
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,039
No. As one researcher pointed out,
the medical information

346
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:37,880
that you relay to your physician
is highly protected,

347
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,559
but if you go to a medical website
and search for terms

348
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,759
like "HIV" or "abortion," that
information is not protected at all.

349
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,799
It's a system
that seems ripe for abuse

350
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,160
before you learn that some
data brokers have offered lists

351
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,079
such as, "Suffering Seniors",
"Pay Day Loan Central Hispanic",

352
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:00,960
or even "Help Needed,
I Am 90 Days Behind on Bills".

353
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,960
And some in this industry

354
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,519
will insist that they would never put
people at risk by selling their data.

355
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:07,759
Remember Epsilon,

356
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,480
the company that collects
clouds of information about you?

357
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,400
In 2014, their then-CEO
even went on "60 Minutes"

358
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,519
to reassure people that his business,
in particular,

359
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:20,359
operated in a completely
above-board manner.

360
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,640
If there are abuses out there,

361
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
we don't believe those happen
within our company,

362
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,720
and we would be
the first to raise our hand.

363
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,640
Really? You would be the first
to raise your hand, would you?

364
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,759
That is interesting.
Especially because last year,

365
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,319
Epsilon settled with the DOJ
for $150 million

366
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,680
for facilitating elder fraud schemes,

367
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,279
after admitting that it sold
more than 30 million consumers' data

368
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:46,680
to clients who employees
knew were carrying out scams.

369
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:48,880
And they were doing it
for nearly a decade.

370
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,920
So, I guess that that guy should've
been doing that entire interview

371
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,799
with his fucking hand in the air.

372
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:57,359
At this point, you may be thinking,
"Okay. I think I get it.

373
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,119
I am sufficiently creeped out, there is
nothing more that you need to tell me."

374
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,400
Well, hold on. What about
the fact that apps on your phone

375
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,359
can give away your exact location
to third parties,

376
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,920
sometimes without you
even knowing it?

377
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,279
This free flashlight app settled
with the FTC for doing just that.

378
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,319
And they are not alone.
Take Life360, an app giving families

379
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,079
the opportunity to keep track
of one another.

380
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,720
You may have seen their ads
featuring parents looking relieved

381
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,559
because they can see
where their kids are going

382
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,960
and know when they have
safely reached their destination.

383
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,079
Guess what?

384
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,759
A new report from the website
The Markup says that Life360

385
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,319
sells its location data
to about a dozen different brokers,

386
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,200
who then sell it to marketers.

387
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,640
It turns out they were selling location
data to around 12 different brokers.

388
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,119
It's like those old commercials:

389
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,680
"It's 10 o'clock,
do you know where your children are?

390
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:51,039
'Cause if so, same!"

391
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:57,400
And I have to tell you, Life360 insists
that they are no longer doing that,

392
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,799
and that anyway, they had de-identified
their users' data before selling it.

393
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,160
That last claim
is actually very common

394
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:07,400
among both data brokers
and the companies that they work with,

395
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,160
and it is worth taking a look at.

396
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:14,039
'Cause while it sounds reassuring,
the truth is, it can be incredibly easy

397
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:16,599
to find out
who is behind a number or a code.

398
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:21,359
One team of researchers even found
that 99.98 percent of Americans

399
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,559
would be correctly re-identified
in any data set

400
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,480
using just 15 demographic attributes,
among them age, gender, marital status.

401
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:32,559
And the ease of de-anonymizing data

402
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,960
is something that we have
actually known about for years.

403
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,480
In 2006,
AOL turned over a bunch

404
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,960
of these anonymized search records
of their users to the public,

405
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:41,920
and it only took a few short hours

406
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,079
for a reporter to decode
who user number 4417749 was.

407
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,960
Between searches for things like
"numb fingers," "60s single men",

408
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:51,759
and "dog that urinates
on everything",

409
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:54,160
the reporter uncovered
a woman named Thelma Arnold.

410
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,279
She was age 62.

411
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,960
Okay, I am not saying that it is at all
pleasant that that happened,

412
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,400
but for the record, I am glad that it
introduced me to Thelma Arnold

413
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,559
because I love that woman.

414
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,319
She hasn't given up,
despite her numb fingers,

415
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,920
lackluster love life,
and utterly broken dog.

416
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,000
None of that is stopping her
from shooting her shot

417
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:16,119
and looking for single men
in her area.

418
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,920
We stan a middle-aged queen
with stamina.

419
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,960
As we looked into this story,
we constantly got reminders

420
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,440
that none of us
are really anonymous online.

421
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:28,799
At one point, a researcher
clicked on this company's website,

422
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,480
didn't do anything else,
just went there on his browser,

423
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,400
and later that day, got this email,
saying that they knew he visited,

424
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,880
and "We offer a pretty cool service
called Website Visitor Identification

425
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,920
which helps brands identify
who's browsing their website.

426
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,039
In fact, it's how we knew
how to send you this quick email!"

427
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,839
Which is just objectively unsettling.

428
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,200
I don't want anyone tracking
what my staff members are doing online,

429
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,799
mainly because I don't want to know
how many of them have looked up

430
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,640
"What is John Oliver like?"

431
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,799
And it is not like data brokers
are super careful

432
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:06,440
about who gets
your sensitive information.

433
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:10,160
You have already seen a local news
station ambush a pregnant woman.

434
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,480
And a few years ago, CBS bought
some location data from brokers

435
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,720
and it did not take much for them
to find out whose it was,

436
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:20,160
where they lived,
and what they were doing.

437
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,839
No names or phone numbers
were tied to the data,

438
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,519
but it was easy to figure out
who each phone belongs to

439
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:28,160
based on where they spend
their nights here in Greenwich.

440
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:32,200
One phone pinged in the morning
inside a $7 million mansion.

441
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,519
The person
then visited a country club

442
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:37,160
before heading downtown
and returning home.

443
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,640
That doesn't feel great, does it?

444
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,319
Although I will say, that particular
example is not that surprising to me.

445
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,240
If you told me
an individual woke up

446
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:47,960
in a $7 million mansion
in Greenwich, Connecticut,

447
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:50,119
and made me guess where they
went next, I'd have gone with,

448
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,880
"I don't know, a country club,

449
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,839
downtown to hunt humans for sport,
and then home again."

450
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,359
And I'd have been pretty sure
that I was right.

451
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,200
And the thing is,
that kind of identifying information

452
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:04,119
can cause huge problems.

453
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,960
Just last year,
a priest was forced to resign

454
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,559
after a Catholic newsletter said
it used app data signals from Grindr

455
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,200
to monitor his activity, and matching
his phone to his residence,

456
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:15,799
essentially outing him.

457
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,799
Which is a massive,
harmful invasion of privacy,

458
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,960
and definitely the worst scandal
ever to hit the Catholic Church.

459
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,200
Also, just quick side note here.

460
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:29,599
Catholic Church, are you absolutely
sure that Jesus was homophobic?

461
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:33,079
Think about it, he had mutually
respectful friendships with women,

462
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,160
a distant relationship
with his father,

463
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,039
and when he found out
he was going to be betrayed,

464
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:39,799
he invited everyone
to a confrontational dinner.

465
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,039
I'm just saying it might be worth
re-examining your thesis there.

466
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,680
And look, you might still think,
"I don't care about this.

467
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:49,200
My life is an open book,
I have no secrets,

468
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,480
so data brokers
can just have at it."

469
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:56,079
Even if that is true for you, though,
consider there are others out there

470
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,079
who might have very good reasons
to not want to be found.

471
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,599
Donna is a domestic violence victim.
We're protecting her identity.

472
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,039
One of her addresses
came up on a data broker site.

473
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:08,000
She says that's frightening.

474
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:11,680
If you have
someone that's tried to kill you,

475
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,079
for them to be able
to just type in your name

476
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,720
and any known address
that you've ever stayed in can pop up,

477
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,119
it's scary because now they know
ways to start trying to find you.

478
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,039
Right, and that's not just theoretical,
it has happened.

479
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,000
In New Hampshire,
a stalker killed a former classmate

480
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,279
after finding her with information
that he bought from a data broker

481
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,920
for $45.

482
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,599
And if you have a stalker, or you
are a victim of domestic violence,

483
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,880
it is understandable
to want your information

484
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,160
removed from these
people-search sites.

485
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,200
But each has its own specific,
and sometimes very complex

486
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,039
process of requesting
the removal of information.

487
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:57,319
And there is no federal law requiring
that they honor an opt-out request.

488
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,039
And the lack of regulation here

489
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:02,240
doesn't just benefit individuals
who might mean you harm,

490
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:04,319
it benefits the government, too.

491
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,559
Because it gives them

492
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,960
a very attractive loophole
to the Fourth Amendment protection

493
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,319
against unreasonable
search and seizures.

494
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,240
Because under that, the government
typically needs a warrant

495
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:16,880
to collect information
about you without your consent.

496
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,079
But if it is not forcing someone
to turn over your data,

497
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,720
if it's simply buying it
from a data broker,

498
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:27,319
that is apparently fine,
no warrant necessary.

499
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:30,200
And you can see how valuable
that would be to them.

500
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:32,200
It happens all the time.

501
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:36,200
In fact, federal agencies from the
FBI to ICE have purchased data,

502
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:39,920
"without warrants, public disclosures,
or robust oversight,

503
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,640
to carry out everything from criminal
investigations to deportations."

504
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,519
And you might not know

505
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,039
if your information has been supplied
to the government by an app.

506
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:52,480
Even the company
behind the app might not know.

507
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,799
Because it might sell
your info to a broker,

508
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,000
which then resells it to someone else,
which supplies it to the government.

509
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,319
I'll give you an example:
a couple years back,

510
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,759
Vice found that the app Muslim Pro,
which let Muslims know when to pray,

511
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:08,079
had been selling user location data

512
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,960
to a broker that supplied information
to the U.S. government.

513
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:14,200
And while,
because the chain is so opaque,

514
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:18,039
it is hard to know what was sold,
or what the government did with it,

515
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:21,319
the app's users
were understandably pretty alarmed.

516
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:27,279
Feeling disturbed,
appalled, but not surprised.

517
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:29,240
Sara Mostafavi used Muslim Pro,

518
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:33,359
that app has since reportedly
severed ties with its data partners.

519
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,160
So intrusive!
My conversation with God

520
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,799
is not information
the government needs.

521
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,960
Yeah, of course it's not information
the government needs.

522
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,319
There's a reason the book wasn't called
"Are You There God? It's Me Margaret

523
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,759
and Homeland Security's On the Line
as Well, Hope That's Cool."

524
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,079
So, to recap here,
we've got shady data brokers

525
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,000
with virtually
no oversight collecting your data

526
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:59,519
and building profiles that can track
who you are, where you are,

527
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:01,880
and what you are most
likely to do or buy.

528
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,400
You cannot edit this dossier,
and others,

529
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,279
from cops to reporters
to your own abusers,

530
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:08,160
can find and use this information.

531
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,880
It's not a great situation.
So, what do we do?

532
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,079
Well, it is a bit tricky,
especially given the fact

533
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,920
that the entire economy
of the internet right now

534
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
is basically built on this practice.

535
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:24,000
All the free stuff
that you take for granted online

536
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:26,920
is only free
because you are the product.

537
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,519
They make money
by selling your data.

538
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,039
But experts say

539
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:34,039
that there are actually some small
steps that you can personally take.

540
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:36,039
You can use
web browsers like these

541
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:38,759
to help better protect you
against third-party tracking.

542
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:41,400
And if you have an iPhone,
you can go to the privacy menu,

543
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,000
hit the tracking button,

544
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:46,240
and turn off "allow apps
to request to track."

545
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,279
But this should
not be your responsibility,

546
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:52,759
your privacy should be
the default setting here.

547
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:56,480
And there should be legal fixes to this.
Other countries have actually tried.

548
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,319
The EU passed a law

549
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,880
to force sites to disclose cookies
and allow you to opt-out.

550
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:06,200
But, I will say, companies now
often cleverly present those options

551
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:08,559
in the most annoying way possible,

552
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,279
with "accept all cookies"
an easy default,

553
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,160
but if you want to reject them,

554
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,759
forcing you to go through multiple
confusing steps for no clear reason.

555
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:19,000
Which is very smart,
to be honest.

556
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:21,720
No one is going to put in the work
to reject cookies

557
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:23,839
just to sneak a peek at an article

558
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,960
titled "Five Times
Andrew Garfield Just Was."

559
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,960
You'd much rather just hit "accept"
and enjoy your remaining time on Earth

560
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,839
gazing at the most emotionally
connected Spiderman

561
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,319
to ever splooge the ooze.

562
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,599
Now, as for here in the U.S.,

563
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,640
individual states have tried
to limit data brokers,

564
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,799
but advocates
say that what is really needed

565
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,400
is a comprehensive federal
privacy law governing them.

566
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,559
This has been proposed
for years now,

567
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,079
but nothing has happened,
for a couple of key reasons.

568
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,039
First, data broker spending
on lobbying in 2020

569
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:57,240
rivaled that of Facebook and Google.

570
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,519
But also,
politicians now famously

571
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,920
build their campaigns
on data obtained from brokers.

572
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:07,240
Both parties regularly boast
about how much they use data.

573
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:10,319
And in fact, just listen to former
RNC Chair Reince Preibus

574
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,839
openly bragging about it.

575
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:17,359
Everything about almost every
potential voter in Georgia is known.

576
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,440
And it's not even a joke,
they know what beer they drink,

577
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:23,039
what car they drive,
how many kids they have,

578
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,599
and all that data is used to target
every single voter in Georgia.

579
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,039
It's true.
Politicians rely on data

580
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:34,440
to be able to target our interests
with pinpoint precision.

581
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:37,599
Although I do wonder
why no presidential candidate

582
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,720
has then yet targeted me personally
with ads promising to fight

583
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,319
for the shower of morning chunks
I so richly deserve.

584
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,519
I Google it all the time,
you would have my vote instantly.

585
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:52,720
It is frustrating that the people who
could do something about data brokers

586
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,359
are so actively incentivized not to.

587
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,599
But here is where
we may be able to help.

588
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,440
Because, interestingly,
the one time that Congress

589
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,920
has acted quickly
to safeguard people's privacy

590
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,519
was back in the 1980s,

591
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:08,079
when Robert Bork
was nominated to the Supreme Court,

592
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,599
and a reporter
walked into a local video store

593
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,079
and asked the manager
whether he could have a peek

594
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,880
at Bork's video rental history,
and he got it.

595
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:20,119
And as soon as Congress realized
there was nothing stopping anyone

596
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,240
from retrieving
their video rental records, too,

597
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:27,440
they freaked the fuck out,
and lo and behold,

598
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,480
The Video Privacy Protection Act
was passed with quite deliberate speed.

599
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,279
So, it does seem when Congress'
own privacy is at risk,

600
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:37,480
they somehow find a way to act.

601
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:40,200
And it also seems
like they are not entirely aware

602
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:44,079
just how easy it is for anyone,
and I do mean anyone,

603
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,240
to get their personal information.

604
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:50,759
Which brings me to me.
Because in researching this story,

605
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:54,599
we realized there is any number
of perfectly legal bits of fuckery

606
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,079
that we could engage in.

607
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,759
We could, for example,

608
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:01,200
use data brokers to go fishing
for members of Congress,

609
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:05,680
by creating a demographic group
consisting of men aged 45 and up,

610
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:08,039
in a five-mile radius
of the U.S. Capitol,

611
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:10,480
who had previously
visited sites regarding,

612
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,440
or searched for terms including,

613
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:15,839
"divorce," "massage,"
"hair loss," and "midlife crisis."

614
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,160
We could call that group
"Congress and Cabernet,"

615
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:25,240
and then target that list with ads
that might attract those men to click,

616
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:29,519
like, "Marriage shouldn't be a prison,"
or "Can you vote twice?"

617
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,519
We could also throw in,

618
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:34,160
"Do you want to read Ted Cruz
erotic fan fiction?"

619
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:36,599
just to see what would happen.

620
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,319
And if anyone clicked,

621
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,160
we would then be able to harvest
even more data from them,

622
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,759
which we could then theoretically
take steps to de-anonymize.

623
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:48,480
Now, am I saying that
we're actually going to do that?

624
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,079
Collect all that raw information
and store it in,

625
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,480
let's say,
a manila envelope somewhere?

626
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,160
I'm sorry to disappoint you:
we are not going to do that.

627
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,799
Why would we,
when we've already done it?

628
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,359
Because...

629
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,759
All that raw data
is currently right in here.

630
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:12,440
And honestly, this whole
exercise was fucking creepy.

631
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,200
We ran those three targeted ads
this week in the Capitol Hill area,

632
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,440
and to give you just a sense
of how many clicks we got,

633
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,160
it was very much not zero.

634
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,440
Do you want to see more?
Because I do! Please, come with me.

635
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,960
'Cause...

636
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,960
Let's start
with the very first hit that we got.

637
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:37,039
It came at 3:35 PM
on Tuesday afternoon

638
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:39,640
from around
the Embassy Row area,

639
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,920
when a man fitting our demographic
description clicked on the Ted Cruz ad,

640
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,480
meaning that we now have
his IP address and device ID,

641
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:50,160
and also know that he did it
on an Android phone.

642
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,720
So, we could now take steps
to identify him.

643
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:55,799
Just like we could
with all these others

644
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,519
who clicked on one of our ads
in the Capitol Hill area this week,

645
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,160
including at least three

646
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,519
who may have been inside
the Capitol Building itself.

647
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,680
One of whom clicked on
the "Can you vote twice?" ad,

648
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:09,760
one of whom clicked
on the divorce one

649
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,239
and another who clicked
on the Ted Cruz erotic fanfiction,

650
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,480
which was distressingly popular.

651
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:18,920
And if you're thinking,
"How on earth is any of this legal?"

652
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,920
I totally agree with you,
it shouldn't be.

653
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,840
And if you happen to be

654
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,800
a legislator who is feeling
a little nervous right now

655
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,159
about whether your information
is in this envelope,

656
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:33,320
and you are terrified
about what I might do with it,

657
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,360
you might want
to channel that worry

658
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,639
into making sure
that I can't do anything.

659
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:39,719
Anyway, sleep well!

660
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:41,719
That's our show.

661
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,440
Thank you so much for watching.
We'll see you next week. Good night!
