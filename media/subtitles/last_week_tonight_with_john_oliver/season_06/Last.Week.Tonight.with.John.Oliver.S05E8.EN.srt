welcome to "last week tonight!"

00:00:33,515 --> 00:00:34,482
I'm John Oliver.

00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:36,384
Thank you so much
for joining us.

8
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:38,353
Just time for a quick
recap of the week.

9
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,321
And we're going to focus on a

10
00:00:39,387 --> 00:00:40,989
couple of stories
out of britain.

11
00:00:41,056 --> 00:00:42,223
First, brexit, which I believe

12
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,725
is short for "brain exit," the

13
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:44,960
official word for when

14
00:00:45,026 --> 00:00:45,994
everything that makes sense goes

15
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:47,395
out the window and everyone is

16
00:00:47,462 --> 00:00:49,030
just stupid all the time.

17
00:00:49,097 --> 00:00:50,298
Britain was supposed to have

18
00:00:50,365 --> 00:00:51,466
left the e. U. By Friday, but the

19
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:54,569
day before the deadline,
this happened.

20
00:00:54,636 --> 00:00:56,338
The u. K. Is heading for a

21
00:00:56,404 --> 00:00:58,039
Halloween brexit after the e. U.

22
00:00:58,106 --> 00:00:59,374
Extended the deadline for

23
00:00:59,441 --> 00:01:02,944
withdrawal until
October the 31st.

24
00:01:03,011 --> 00:01:05,347
John: "Halloween brexit"?

25
00:01:05,413 --> 00:01:06,748
Look, brexit is plenty scary

26
00:01:06,815 --> 00:01:10,485
enough without adding
Halloween to it.

27
00:01:10,552 --> 00:01:11,853
It's like we found out there was

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,221
a meteor rapidly approaching

29
00:01:13,288 --> 00:01:14,789
earth and named it "weinstein."

30
00:01:14,856 --> 00:01:16,091
It's overkill.

31
00:01:16,157 --> 00:01:19,594
It's complete overkill
at that point.

32
00:01:19,661 --> 00:01:20,228
But it is true, the brexit

33
00:01:20,295 --> 00:01:22,998
deadline has been
delayed until October.

34
00:01:23,064 --> 00:01:24,866
Now, what will they do
with the extra time?

35
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:25,467
Who knows?

36
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:26,134
It's hard to imagine that

37
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:27,035
unsolvable problems ‐‐ like how

38
00:01:27,102 --> 00:01:27,702
to create a hard border with

39
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:28,436
Ireland without sparking

40
00:01:28,503 --> 00:01:29,671
sectarian violence ‐‐

41
00:01:29,738 --> 00:01:31,473
will suddenly be solved
within six months.

42
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:32,807
And many, many British people

43
00:01:32,874 --> 00:01:35,210
seem exhausted by the extension.

44
00:01:35,276 --> 00:01:36,244
I imagine in six months' time

45
00:01:36,311 --> 00:01:37,379
we'll probably be in the same

46
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:38,880
place we're at now, another

47
00:01:38,947 --> 00:01:39,781
stalemate where it's either

48
00:01:39,848 --> 00:01:41,583
gonna get suspended ‐‐ extended

49
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,252
another six months or who knows?

50
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,320
Oh, god.

51
00:01:45,387 --> 00:01:48,757
Another six months
talking about brexit?

52
00:01:48,823 --> 00:01:50,592
John: Yeah, I can
see how she feels.

53
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:51,926
Or at least I could before

54
00:01:51,993 --> 00:01:53,428
brexit interviews started

55
00:01:53,495 --> 00:01:54,295
featuring people being casually

56
00:01:54,362 --> 00:01:56,898
eaten by parrots when they talk.

57
00:01:56,965 --> 00:01:58,933
I would trade another 18 months

58
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,568
of brexit to find out
more about that man.

59
00:02:00,635 --> 00:02:03,471
Like "how did he
become a Yankees fan?"

60
00:02:03,538 --> 00:02:05,640
And "is that his parrot?"

61
00:02:05,707 --> 00:02:06,741
'Cause if it isn't, that is the

62
00:02:06,808 --> 00:02:07,876
calmest I've seen someone stay

63
00:02:07,942 --> 00:02:10,712
during a random televised
parrot attack.

64
00:02:10,779 --> 00:02:11,846
This wasn't even the first time

65
00:02:11,913 --> 00:02:13,481
that the deadline has
been pushed back.

66
00:02:13,548 --> 00:02:14,449
Britain was supposed to leave on

67
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:15,583
march 29th.

68
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,384
And to hear some brexit

69
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:17,285
supporters tell it, that's when

70
00:02:17,352 --> 00:02:19,120
it did happen.

71
00:02:19,187 --> 00:02:20,488
The 29th of march should have

72
00:02:20,555 --> 00:02:21,122
been the day we leave, and in my

73
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:23,692
eyes, we've left.

74
00:02:23,758 --> 00:02:25,226
But it's not and you haven't.

75
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:26,361
So what?

76
00:02:26,428 --> 00:02:27,996
In my eyes, we have.

77
00:02:28,063 --> 00:02:28,863
Today is our independence day,

78
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:29,764
and whether we have it or not,

79
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:31,332
we're celebrating it.

80
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:33,368
John: Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

81
00:02:33,435 --> 00:02:34,335
Hold on, hold on.

82
00:02:34,402 --> 00:02:35,570
If all that matters to brexit

83
00:02:35,637 --> 00:02:36,571
supporters is what happens

84
00:02:36,638 --> 00:02:38,673
"in their eyes," we may've found

85
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,241
a solution: Cancel brexit, but

86
00:02:40,308 --> 00:02:42,177
allow everyone to say it

87
00:02:42,243 --> 00:02:44,479
happened if it makes
them feel better.

88
00:02:44,546 --> 00:02:45,847
That way, no devastating

89
00:02:45,914 --> 00:02:46,915
economic consequences and brexit

90
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:47,882
supporters get to live happily

91
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:48,883
ever after in their own personal

92
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,820
"United Kingdom of
the imagination."

93
00:02:51,886 --> 00:02:53,588
But that wasn't the only big

94
00:02:53,655 --> 00:02:54,022
news out of britain.

95
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:55,590
There was also news concerning

96
00:02:55,657 --> 00:02:56,958
Julian Assange, the most

97
00:02:57,025 --> 00:02:58,093
controversial Australian export

98
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,361
since vegemite.

99
00:03:00,428 --> 00:03:02,864
This week saw a
major development.

100
00:03:02,931 --> 00:03:04,432
Julian Assange arrested.

101
00:03:04,499 --> 00:03:06,134
Julian Assange, now with a

102
00:03:06,201 --> 00:03:06,668
beard, carried out of the

103
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:07,902
Ecuadorian embassy by London's

104
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:11,005
metropolitan police.

105
00:03:11,072 --> 00:03:13,174
That bedraggled
beard, lengthy hair.

106
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:15,243
Looking tired, looking older,

107
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,579
significantly much older.

108
00:03:17,645 --> 00:03:18,747
Looking a very different man

109
00:03:18,813 --> 00:03:19,814
than the one who went into that

110
00:03:19,881 --> 00:03:23,084
embassy some seven years ago.

111
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:24,219
John: That's a weird tone to

112
00:03:24,285 --> 00:03:26,287
take on a story that
is this important.

113
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:27,255
"Yes, his arrest sparks a

114
00:03:27,322 --> 00:03:28,356
difficult debate about the

115
00:03:28,423 --> 00:03:29,290
efficacy of journalistic

116
00:03:29,357 --> 00:03:30,225
protections in the age of

117
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,894
cyber‐espionage, but
look how bad he looks!

118
00:03:32,961 --> 00:03:34,395
He looks like a peeled potato

119
00:03:34,462 --> 00:03:35,029
rolled in spiderwebs.

120
00:03:35,096 --> 00:03:37,432
He looks like Kenneth
Branagh's ghost.

121
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:39,701
He looks like Gandalf
fucked his stick.

122
00:03:39,768 --> 00:03:41,636
We're having fun.

123
00:03:41,703 --> 00:03:43,171
We're having fun, aren't we?"

124
00:03:43,238 --> 00:03:44,706
But, look, this is a big deal.

125
00:03:44,773 --> 00:03:46,407
Julian Assange has now been

126
00:03:46,474 --> 00:03:47,442
kicked out of the Ecuadorian

127
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:49,611
embassy after spending
seven years there.

128
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:54,082
And part of the reason they

129
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:55,350
may have wanted him out may be

130
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,584
that he did not make life easy

131
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:57,218
for his hosts.

132
00:03:57,285 --> 00:03:57,986
There have been reports for

133
00:03:58,052 --> 00:03:58,787
some time that assange was sort

134
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:00,021
of ‐‐ had outlived his welcome

135
00:04:00,088 --> 00:04:01,156
there in the embassy for all

136
00:04:01,222 --> 00:04:02,123
sorts of reasons, including

137
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,925
his ‐‐ you know, that his cat

138
00:04:03,992 --> 00:04:05,426
had been making a mess and that

139
00:04:05,493 --> 00:04:07,462
he was skateboarding
in the halls.

140
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:09,764
Stealing wi‐fi.

141
00:04:09,831 --> 00:04:11,499
John: Oh, that's not all.

142
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:12,600
The ambassador also said that

143
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:13,968
assange's indoor soccer games

144
00:04:14,035 --> 00:04:15,470
had destroyed embassy equipment

145
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:16,504
and the government had to

146
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:19,307
require him to start
cleaning his bathroom.

147
00:04:19,374 --> 00:04:20,675
And, look, at some point in our

148
00:04:20,742 --> 00:04:22,277
lives, we have all lived with

149
00:04:22,343 --> 00:04:23,578
someone like this, and we wished

150
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:25,046
that we could have British

151
00:04:25,113 --> 00:04:26,548
police carry them out of our

152
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:28,650
building like a hastily
rolled carpet.

153
00:04:28,716 --> 00:04:29,884
And, look, it's easy to dislike

154
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:31,386
Julian Assange.

155
00:04:31,452 --> 00:04:33,655
He first fled to the embassy to

156
00:04:33,721 --> 00:04:35,790
escape extradition to Sweden on

157
00:04:35,857 --> 00:04:37,759
rape charges, charges he denies.

158
00:04:37,826 --> 00:04:40,028
And alongside the valuable

159
00:04:40,094 --> 00:04:41,496
information that wikileaks has

160
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:42,764
helped release, they've also

161
00:04:42,831 --> 00:04:43,765
recklessly published the

162
00:04:43,832 --> 00:04:44,732
sensitive personal data of

163
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:47,402
hundreds of ordinary people,

164
00:04:47,468 --> 00:04:48,937
potentially putting
lives at risk.

165
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:50,939
And that's not even getting into

166
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:51,472
the fact that wikileak's

167
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:52,373
publication of hacked emails in

168
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,708
2016 helped elect
trump president.

169
00:04:53,775 --> 00:04:55,076
So you're allowed not to like

170
00:04:55,143 --> 00:04:56,211
him, but America's current

171
00:04:56,277 --> 00:04:57,579
attempts to extradite him hang

172
00:04:57,645 --> 00:04:58,479
on a specific charge that many

173
00:04:58,546 --> 00:05:00,014
press advocates find unsettling.

174
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:01,583
The u. S. Justice department

175
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:02,784
has charged him with conspiracy

176
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:04,652
to commit computer intrusion.

177
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:06,221
Authorities are accusing assange

178
00:05:06,287 --> 00:05:07,522
of conspiring to crack a

179
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:08,857
password in order to obtain

180
00:05:08,923 --> 00:05:11,893
classified government documents.

181
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,127
John: Now, that charge stems

182
00:05:13,194 --> 00:05:14,095
from his correspondence with

183
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:15,230
Chelsea Manning before the

184
00:05:15,296 --> 00:05:16,397
publication of classified

185
00:05:16,464 --> 00:05:17,298
documents in 2010.

186
00:05:17,365 --> 00:05:18,800
And on its face, it currently

187
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:20,401
seems more than a little flimsy,

188
00:05:20,468 --> 00:05:21,870
prompting the committee to

189
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:23,605
protect journalists to call it

190
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:24,539
"troubling for press freedom,"

191
00:05:24,606 --> 00:05:25,607
because the indictment's

192
00:05:25,673 --> 00:05:26,708
language seems to criminalize a

193
00:05:26,774 --> 00:05:27,742
broad range of legally protected

194
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:30,311
and common
journalistic activity.

195
00:05:30,378 --> 00:05:31,880
And while it is still early at

196
00:05:31,946 --> 00:05:32,847
this point and we don't know

197
00:05:32,914 --> 00:05:33,882
what else assange might be

198
00:05:33,948 --> 00:05:34,983
charged with, or even whether

199
00:05:35,049 --> 00:05:36,317
the u. K. Will extradite him at

200
00:05:36,384 --> 00:05:37,719
all, this story is worrying for

201
00:05:37,785 --> 00:05:38,786
a number of reasons: One,

202
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:40,121
because journalistic freedoms

203
00:05:40,188 --> 00:05:42,690
may be under threat.

204
00:05:42,757 --> 00:05:44,158
And two, unfortunately, in order

205
00:05:44,225 --> 00:05:45,493
to protect them, we may be

206
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,061
forced to utter the one phrase

207
00:05:47,128 --> 00:05:48,496
in the english language scarier

208
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:50,064
than "Halloween brexit" and

209
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:51,432
that's, "I'm really sorry,

210
00:05:51,499 --> 00:05:53,801
everyone, but it might actually

211
00:05:53,868 --> 00:05:54,702
be time to defend
Julian Assange."

212
00:05:54,769 --> 00:05:56,137
And now this.

213
00:05:56,204 --> 00:05:59,641
Announcer: And now, why
would you say that?

214
00:05:59,707 --> 00:06:02,744
Amazon earned $92
million last quarter.

215
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,748
You know why?

216
00:06:06,814 --> 00:06:07,949
'Cause they sell sex toys and

217
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:09,918
Walmart can't or
won't sell sex toys.

218
00:06:09,984 --> 00:06:11,152
Amazon does.

219
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:12,820
A friend of mine works
in the warehouse.

220
00:06:12,887 --> 00:06:13,721
He says they sell a ton of them.

221
00:06:13,788 --> 00:06:14,923
Yeah.

222
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:16,591
I'm just telling you how it is.

223
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:18,059
Are you smelling me?

224
00:06:18,126 --> 00:06:20,194
Eh, sniffing you a little bit.

225
00:06:20,261 --> 00:06:26,935
You smell good.

226
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:28,102
Hooters girl Rachel
is here live.

227
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:29,470
How do I know?

228
00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:29,904
I just touched her.

229
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:30,705
The weather is kind of like

230
00:06:30,772 --> 00:06:38,246
Harvey weinstein, assaulting us

231
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:39,414
today with the heat
and temperatures.

232
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,114
Okay, Charlie, I'm going to

233
00:06:40,181 --> 00:06:41,349
sit here and hang out with my

234
00:06:41,382 --> 00:06:41,782
new best friend.

235
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:42,550
I think you two should get a

236
00:06:42,617 --> 00:06:43,251
hotel room or something.

237
00:06:43,318 --> 00:06:44,316
That's a lot of action
going on over there.

238
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:46,621
Everybody wants a yoga
girl, right, Jason?

239
00:06:46,688 --> 00:06:49,457
That's right.

240
00:06:49,524 --> 00:06:53,061
All right, on that note...
John: Moving on.

241
00:06:53,127 --> 00:06:55,563
Our main story tonight
concerns drugs.

242
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,731
On one hand, America's war on

243
00:06:56,798 --> 00:07:01,869
them has been a complete

244
00:07:01,936 --> 00:07:02,537
catastrophe, but on the other

245
00:07:02,603 --> 00:07:03,438
hand, it did also give

246
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:04,138
us this photo of Nancy Reagan

247
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:05,406
sitting on Mr. t's lap, so it

248
00:07:05,473 --> 00:07:06,174
wasn't a complete loss.

249
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,041
And by the way, I pity the fool

250
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:08,409
that didn't think they were

251
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:13,081
gonna fuck after that.

252
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:14,315
Specifically, specifically,

253
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:15,416
we're going to talk
about opioids.

254
00:07:15,483 --> 00:07:16,017
And if you're thinking, "hold

255
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:17,018
on, didn't you do a
show on this before?"

256
00:07:17,051 --> 00:07:18,386
Yeah, we did one two
and a half years ago.

257
00:07:18,453 --> 00:07:19,887
But tonight, we're going to do

258
00:07:19,954 --> 00:07:21,622
an update for a couple
of key reasons.

259
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:23,391
First, the epidemic
is very much ongoing.

260
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,359
In 2017, opioid overdoses killed

261
00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:28,529
more than 47,000 Americans.

262
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:29,931
And second, since then, we've

263
00:07:29,998 --> 00:07:30,698
learned a lot more about many of

264
00:07:30,765 --> 00:07:31,332
the companies involved, and some

265
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,900
of it has been amazing.

266
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:34,135
For instance, a criminal case

267
00:07:34,202 --> 00:07:35,737
involving executives from the

268
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:37,472
drugmaker insys unearthed a

269
00:07:37,538 --> 00:07:39,273
rap video they allegedly made to

270
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,943
motivate their sales force to go

271
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,610
out and sell a painkiller

272
00:07:42,677 --> 00:07:43,344
containing the highly addictive

273
00:07:43,411 --> 00:07:47,382
drug fentanyl.

274
00:07:47,448 --> 00:07:47,982

Beast.

291
00:08:12,473 --> 00:08:13,207
Let's just stop for a moment to

292
00:08:13,274 --> 00:08:14,475
unpack the line, "if you're

293
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:15,376
trying to ball, I'll substitute

294
00:08:15,443 --> 00:08:16,344
you like a xylitol."

295
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:17,678
That is a reference to the key

296
00:08:17,745 --> 00:08:18,646
ingredient in sugar‐free gum.

297
00:08:18,713 --> 00:08:19,547
It is astonishingly, almost

298
00:08:19,614 --> 00:08:22,583
impossibly lame.

299
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,851
It is genuinely difficult to

300
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:25,586
come up with a rap
that's lamer that that.

301
00:08:25,653 --> 00:08:26,320
I'll show you: "Splash rules

302
00:08:26,387 --> 00:08:27,021
everything around me.

303
00:08:27,088 --> 00:08:28,256
Hanks get the mermaid.

304
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:30,458
Daryl Daryl Hannah y'all."

305
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:32,126
Now, is that lame?

306
00:08:32,193 --> 00:08:32,994
Is that lame?

307
00:08:33,061 --> 00:08:33,861
Yes.

308
00:08:33,928 --> 00:08:35,663
Is it lamer than
the insys video?

309
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,998
I think it's hard for you to

310
00:08:37,065 --> 00:08:37,999
make that case.

311
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:39,834
And that rap video was just the

312
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:41,002
tip of the iceberg in terms of

313
00:08:41,069 --> 00:08:42,336
new information now coming out

314
00:08:42,403 --> 00:08:43,671
through numerous court cases.

315
00:08:43,738 --> 00:08:45,239
So tonight, let's pull a few of

316
00:08:45,306 --> 00:08:46,541
these new revelations together

317
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:47,708
and look at what we've learned

318
00:08:47,775 --> 00:08:49,010
about how the first wave of the

319
00:08:49,077 --> 00:08:51,345
opioid crisis began, because

320
00:08:51,412 --> 00:08:53,081
it's a story of how major

321
00:08:53,147 --> 00:08:54,215
companies acted wildly

322
00:08:54,282 --> 00:08:55,583
irresponsibly, skirted any

323
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,584
meaningful consequences, and for

324
00:08:56,651 --> 00:08:59,053
the most part, avoided
public scrutiny.

325
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,355
And let's start with
drug distributors.

326
00:09:01,422 --> 00:09:02,824
These are the big three.

327
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:03,758
They're the companies

328
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:05,059
responsible for getting drugs to

329
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:06,127
pharmacies and hospitals.

330
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:07,495
They're supposed to alert

331
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:08,763
authorities if they notice

332
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:15,536
suspicious orders of
controlled substances.

333
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:16,938
But for a sense of just how

334
00:09:17,004 --> 00:09:18,272
badly they failed to do that,

335
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:19,540
look at Kermit, West Virginia,

336
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:20,875
named, of course, because it's

337
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:22,110
where Kermit the frog lives with

338
00:09:22,176 --> 00:09:22,643
his secret second family.

339
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,344
Oh, that's right.

340
00:09:23,411 --> 00:09:24,045
He's in a thruple with

341
00:09:24,112 --> 00:09:24,846
two salamanders named francois

342
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:26,814
and Gary, and they are
very, very happy.

343
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:27,615
It was never you, miss piggy.

344
00:09:27,682 --> 00:09:30,017
It was him.

345
00:09:30,084 --> 00:09:31,252
The amount of opioids sent to

346
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:32,987
Kermit, a town of just 400

347
00:09:33,054 --> 00:09:36,757
people, was utterly ridiculous.

348
00:09:36,824 --> 00:09:38,459
This undercover video of

349
00:09:38,526 --> 00:09:40,228
Kermit's main pharmacy shows

350
00:09:40,294 --> 00:09:42,029
scores of people picking up

351
00:09:42,096 --> 00:09:43,631
prescriptions inside and at the

352
00:09:43,698 --> 00:09:45,466
drive‐thru window.

353
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:47,335
More than 3 million doses of

354
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:49,403
hydrocodone were ordered by a

355
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,905
Kermit pharmacist, James wooley,

356
00:09:50,972 --> 00:09:52,607
in one year.

357
00:09:52,673 --> 00:09:55,042
John: It's true.

358
00:09:55,109 --> 00:09:57,678
3 million doses to a
town of 400 people.

359
00:09:57,745 --> 00:09:58,813
That's around 7500 pills for

360
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,382
every resident in Kermit.

361
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:02,917
And just to be clear, we mean

362
00:10:02,984 --> 00:10:04,185
every resident in Kermit, not

363
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:06,420
every resident "in Kermit."

364
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:07,588
Kermit ‐‐ Kermit is a top, I'll

365
00:10:07,655 --> 00:10:10,057
have you know.

366
00:10:10,124 --> 00:10:13,427
Not that that is any
of your business.

367
00:10:13,494 --> 00:10:14,629
But those sorts of figures

368
00:10:14,695 --> 00:10:15,763
clearly should've caught the

369
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,098
attention of distributors.

370
00:10:17,165 --> 00:10:19,267
In fact, the largest one,

371
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,535
mckesson, alone, shipped

372
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:21,435
5 million doses of opioids to

373
00:10:21,502 --> 00:10:22,937
Kermit in just two years.

374
00:10:23,004 --> 00:10:24,138
And that's just one example of

375
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:26,807
mckesson's reckless behavior.

376
00:10:26,874 --> 00:10:27,975
And the problem is, at no point

377
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:29,710
were they effectively deterred.

378
00:10:29,777 --> 00:10:33,481
In 2008, the DEA alleged

379
00:10:33,548 --> 00:10:34,982
that mckesson had failed to

380
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:36,184
control its controlled
substances.

381
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,084
Mckesson agreed to pay a

382
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:38,052
$13 million fine ‐‐

383
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:39,153
that's all ‐‐ without admitting

384
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,221
wrongdoing, and also promised to

385
00:10:40,288 --> 00:10:41,322
do better by implementing a

386
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:44,358
controlled substances
monitoring program.

387
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:48,196
But that emphatically
didn't work.

388
00:10:48,262 --> 00:10:49,864
In fact, a DEA official later

389
00:10:49,931 --> 00:10:50,865
wrote, "their bad acts had

390
00:10:50,932 --> 00:10:52,066
continued and escalated

391
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:53,301
to a level of egregiousness not

392
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:55,036
seen before."

393
00:10:55,102 --> 00:10:57,271
Because of course they did.

394
00:10:57,338 --> 00:10:58,573
You can't put mckesson in charge

395
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,741
of monitoring mckesson.

396
00:11:00,808 --> 00:11:02,410
If the bears in your zoo get out

397
00:11:02,476 --> 00:11:03,744
at night and start mauling the

398
00:11:03,811 --> 00:11:05,580
other animals, you don't

399
00:11:05,646 --> 00:11:06,280
deputize one of the bears to

400
00:11:06,347 --> 00:11:07,748
monitor the situation.

401
00:11:07,815 --> 00:11:08,816
And I know what you're thinking.

402
00:11:08,883 --> 00:11:10,718
"But, John, I've already bought

403
00:11:10,785 --> 00:11:11,852
him a little sheriff's outfit to

404
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:14,622
wear and I think he'd
look great in it."

405
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:15,990
And yes, of course he would, but

406
00:11:16,057 --> 00:11:17,291
at the end of the day, bears are

407
00:11:17,358 --> 00:11:19,694
gonna bear.

408
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,861
It's just in their nature.

409
00:11:20,928 --> 00:11:21,762
And again, before you say,

410
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:22,797
"well, I've spent quite a bit of

411
00:11:22,863 --> 00:11:23,731
money designing a custom‐made

412
00:11:23,798 --> 00:11:24,799
sheriff's badge just for him.

413
00:11:24,865 --> 00:11:26,000
Don't you think the bear will

414
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:27,134
recognize the gravitas of that

415
00:11:27,201 --> 00:11:28,069
symbol and feel compelled to

416
00:11:28,135 --> 00:11:29,937
grow and change his
bear ways in some way?"

417
00:11:30,004 --> 00:11:32,340
No, I don't, because
bears respect nothing.

418
00:11:32,406 --> 00:11:34,308
They think the importance we

419
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:38,246
place on symbols and status

420
00:11:38,312 --> 00:11:39,080
makes us weak, they value

421
00:11:39,146 --> 00:11:39,714
nothing but blood and strength.

422
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:46,120
And I know what you're
going to say now.

423
00:11:46,187 --> 00:11:46,787
"Is there anything I can do?"

424
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:47,822
And the answer, of course, is

425
00:11:47,888 --> 00:11:48,589
no, because while you were

426
00:11:48,656 --> 00:11:49,957
talking, sheriff
bear mauled you.

427
00:11:50,024 --> 00:11:50,858
You're dead.

428
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:51,959
Goodbye.

429
00:11:52,026 --> 00:11:52,760
The point is, mckesson

430
00:11:52,827 --> 00:11:53,628
monitoring itself clearly didn't

431
00:11:53,694 --> 00:11:57,164
work, because in 2017, they

432
00:11:57,231 --> 00:11:58,266
wound up agreeing to a bigger

433
00:11:58,332 --> 00:11:59,267
fine, this time, $150 million,

434
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,668
which sounds like a lot, until

435
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:02,036
you realize that's less than one

436
00:12:02,103 --> 00:12:04,672
one‐thousandth of their revenue

437
00:12:04,739 --> 00:12:07,341
for one year.

438
00:12:07,408 --> 00:12:09,677
And while today mckesson says

439
00:12:09,744 --> 00:12:10,144
they've improved their

440
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:10,911
monitoring systems ‐‐ for

441
00:12:10,978 --> 00:12:13,180
realsies this time,
pinky promise ‐‐

442
00:12:13,247 --> 00:12:15,149
and they argue that they weren't

443
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:16,317
the ones setting the demand for

444
00:12:16,384 --> 00:12:17,885
opioids at any point, even the

445
00:12:17,952 --> 00:12:19,253
DEA agent in charge of their

446
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,590
case thought their
settlement was absurd.

447
00:12:22,657 --> 00:12:26,861
How do you settle?

448
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:27,862
How do you say, it's okay, just,

449
00:12:27,928 --> 00:12:29,096
"here, write this check this

450
00:12:29,163 --> 00:12:29,997
time and ‐‐ and close this place

451
00:12:30,064 --> 00:12:30,831
for a little bit, sign this

452
00:12:30,898 --> 00:12:31,365
piece of paper."

453
00:12:31,432 --> 00:12:32,366
How do you do that?

454
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:33,668
No.

455
00:12:33,734 --> 00:12:34,869
Put 'em in jail.

456
00:12:34,935 --> 00:12:36,170
John: He's right.

457
00:12:36,237 --> 00:12:39,774
Put 'em in jail!

458
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,075
And honestly, I'd watch an

459
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:41,809
entire show that's just that guy

460
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:43,344
telling me where to put things.

461
00:12:43,411 --> 00:12:44,278
Mckesson executives?

462
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:45,813
"Put 'em in jail!"

463
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,514
These carrots?

464
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,948
"Put 'em in soup!"

465
00:12:48,015 --> 00:12:48,949
This group of corgis?

466
00:12:49,016 --> 00:12:51,152
"Put 'em in tiny boots!

467
00:12:51,218 --> 00:12:54,155
They should be in boots!"

468
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:56,757
But that is the
big problem here.

469
00:12:56,824 --> 00:12:58,125
For companies involved in the

470
00:12:58,192 --> 00:12:58,993
opioid crisis, fines just became

471
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,195
the cost of doing business.

472
00:13:01,262 --> 00:13:02,930
And throughout this crisis, it's

473
00:13:02,997 --> 00:13:04,632
been difficult to find any real

474
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:06,000
accountability for the people

475
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:07,468
involved, and there may be no

476
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:09,136
more frustrating example of that

477
00:13:09,203 --> 00:13:10,371
than purdue pharma, the

478
00:13:10,438 --> 00:13:12,239
manufacturer behind oxycontin,

479
00:13:12,306 --> 00:13:13,474
the drug that arguably

480
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,209
kickstarted the crisis.

481
00:13:15,276 --> 00:13:16,744
Purdue famously aggressively

482
00:13:16,811 --> 00:13:18,312
marketed oxycontin to doctors as

483
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:19,780
a less addictive painkiller that

484
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:21,515
could be used to treat common

485
00:13:21,582 --> 00:13:23,017
conditions like backaches and

486
00:13:23,084 --> 00:13:26,020
knee pain, which was
obviously untrue.

487
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:27,621
It would be like using cocaine

488
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:28,956
for a toothache.

489
00:13:29,023 --> 00:13:30,491
Which, incidentally back in the

490
00:13:30,558 --> 00:13:36,697
1800s, people actually did.

491
00:13:36,764 --> 00:13:37,565
What an idea.

492
00:13:37,631 --> 00:13:39,066
"My tooth hurt this morning, but

493
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:40,368
I took some medicine, and now

494
00:13:40,434 --> 00:13:43,671
I'm really fucking psyched about

495
00:13:43,738 --> 00:13:47,441
20 different business ideas.

496
00:13:47,508 --> 00:13:54,582
I'm going to write a screenplay.

497
00:13:54,648 --> 00:13:56,417
I know it's the 1800s!"

498
00:13:56,484 --> 00:13:57,151
Purdue is owned by members of

499
00:13:57,218 --> 00:13:58,018
the sackler family.

500
00:13:58,085 --> 00:13:58,853
Collectively they're worth an

501
00:13:58,919 --> 00:13:59,620
estimated $13 billion, which has

502
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:00,521
enabled them to proudly slap

503
00:14:00,588 --> 00:14:01,021
their name on some truly

504
00:14:01,088 --> 00:14:01,655
impressive monuments to other

505
00:14:01,722 --> 00:14:02,289
people's talent.

506
00:14:02,356 --> 00:14:03,257
The sackler name is on parts of

507
00:14:03,324 --> 00:14:04,525
the met, the louvre, the museum

508
00:14:04,592 --> 00:14:05,159
of natural history, the national

509
00:14:05,226 --> 00:14:05,960
gallery in London, the royal

510
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:06,927
college of art, an institute at

511
00:14:06,994 --> 00:14:08,129
Yale, a library at Oxford,

512
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:08,963
and the sackler crossing at the

513
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:11,198
royal botanic gardens.

514
00:14:11,265 --> 00:14:12,833
Not bad for a family whose name

515
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,335
sounds like a hamburglar‐like

516
00:14:14,402 --> 00:14:16,771
villain that steals testicles.

517
00:14:16,837 --> 00:14:18,072
"Oh, no!

518
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:19,540
The sackler came in the middle

519
00:14:19,607 --> 00:14:21,041
of the night, and now my penis

520
00:14:21,108 --> 00:14:23,811
is shivering!"

521
00:14:23,878 --> 00:14:28,883
The sacklers love putting their

522
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:29,784
names on things.

523
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,951
Although until very recently,

524
00:14:31,018 --> 00:14:31,685
they've been miraculously good

525
00:14:31,752 --> 00:14:32,887
at keeping their name off the

526
00:14:32,953 --> 00:14:33,320
opioid crisis.

527
00:14:33,387 --> 00:14:35,423
But that is now changing with

528
00:14:35,489 --> 00:14:35,990
protests like this.

529
00:14:36,056 --> 00:14:36,757
In New York City this

530
00:14:36,824 --> 00:14:37,758
weekend, protesters flooded the

531
00:14:37,825 --> 00:14:40,194
guggenheim museum.

532
00:14:40,261 --> 00:14:41,462
They dropped fake prescription

533
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:42,963
slips from the upper walkway,

534
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,964
angry that the museum takes big

535
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:45,800
donations from the sackler

536
00:14:45,866 --> 00:14:46,434
family, which has been accused

537
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:52,807
of engineering the
opioid epidemic.

538
00:14:52,873 --> 00:14:53,641
John: Wow.

539
00:14:53,707 --> 00:14:54,308
Look, I know this isn't the

540
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:54,909
point, but spare a thought for

541
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,876
the guggenheim janitor who has

542
00:14:55,943 --> 00:14:56,744
to clean all that up.

543
00:14:56,811 --> 00:14:57,778
Dennis didn't take millions from

544
00:14:57,845 --> 00:14:58,979
the pharmaceutical industry.

545
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:00,114
Dennis gets $15 an hour and

546
00:15:00,181 --> 00:15:01,549
maybe the occasional chance to

547
00:15:01,615 --> 00:15:04,251
masturbate on a cezanne.

548
00:15:04,318 --> 00:15:05,186
Look, look, hey.

549
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:07,521
I didn't say he was
a good janitor.

550
00:15:07,588 --> 00:15:10,558
I just said you should
think about him.

551
00:15:10,624 --> 00:15:11,926
The reason for this change in

552
00:15:11,992 --> 00:15:13,027
public perception is a dawning

553
00:15:13,093 --> 00:15:14,462
realization at just how deeply

554
00:15:14,528 --> 00:15:15,896
some of the sacklers were

555
00:15:15,963 --> 00:15:17,498
involved, because unlike most

556
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:18,699
second‐generation heirs to a

557
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:21,702
family fortune, some
were very hands‐on.

558
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:23,304
Richard sackler worked at purdue

559
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,840
throughout the crisis, serving

560
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:28,876
as president from 1999 to 2003,

561
00:15:28,943 --> 00:15:29,777
and served on the board along

562
00:15:29,844 --> 00:15:31,245
with seven other family members.

563
00:15:31,312 --> 00:15:32,413
And now, thanks to a number of

564
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,384
lawsuits filed by various

565
00:15:37,451 --> 00:15:38,652
states, we're getting glimpses

566
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:39,587
of Richard's involvement.

567
00:15:39,653 --> 00:15:40,421
Massachusetts alleges that

568
00:15:40,488 --> 00:15:41,455
Richard sackler at one point

569
00:15:41,522 --> 00:15:42,289
demanded to be sent into the

570
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:44,592
field with sales reps
on visits to doctors.

571
00:15:44,658 --> 00:15:46,460
In fact, his micromanagement was

572
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:47,161
apparently so extreme that

573
00:15:47,228 --> 00:15:48,329
purdue's vp of sales and

574
00:15:48,395 --> 00:15:49,563
marketing wrote to the ceo,

575
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,865
"anything you can do to reduce

576
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:52,166
the direct contact of Richard

577
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:56,070
into the organization
is appreciated."

578
00:15:56,136 --> 00:15:57,538
And going by some of his

579
00:15:57,605 --> 00:15:58,372
statements, this micromanagement

580
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:01,909
was in service of a
pretty clear purpose.

581
00:16:01,976 --> 00:16:03,277
According to newly filed

582
00:16:03,344 --> 00:16:04,612
court documents, when oxycontin

583
00:16:04,678 --> 00:16:06,180
was first released,

584
00:16:06,247 --> 00:16:07,515
Richard sackler, purdue's former

585
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:09,283
president and son of the company

586
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,318
founder, is quoted saying at a

587
00:16:11,385 --> 00:16:13,454
company event that the launch

588
00:16:13,521 --> 00:16:14,755
would be followed by a "blizzard

589
00:16:14,822 --> 00:16:16,390
of prescriptions."

590
00:16:16,457 --> 00:16:17,725
John: Amazingly, the full

591
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,027
quote is actually worse.

592
00:16:20,094 --> 00:16:21,195
He calls it "a blizzard of

593
00:16:21,262 --> 00:16:22,830
prescriptions that will bury the

594
00:16:22,897 --> 00:16:24,732
competition," and then goes on

595
00:16:24,798 --> 00:16:26,300
to say "the blizzard will be so

596
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,269
deep, dense, and white."

597
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:30,070
And, look, as a tagline for

598
00:16:30,137 --> 00:16:31,839
"frozen 2," that's pretty good,

599
00:16:31,906 --> 00:16:33,173
but it's troubling when applied

600
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,010
to addictive fucking
painkillers.

601
00:16:36,076 --> 00:16:37,478
And Richard sackler's glib tone

602
00:16:37,545 --> 00:16:38,913
continued, even as purdue began

603
00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:40,414
to see the consequences of the

604
00:16:40,481 --> 00:16:43,183
drugs that they were pushing.

605
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,119
At the dawn of the opioid

606
00:16:45,185 --> 00:16:46,086
epidemic, when 59 deaths were

607
00:16:46,153 --> 00:16:47,788
reported in a single state,

608
00:16:47,855 --> 00:16:49,590
purdue's president wrote, "this

609
00:16:49,657 --> 00:16:51,091
is not too bad.

610
00:16:51,158 --> 00:16:53,561
It could have been far worse."

611
00:16:53,627 --> 00:16:55,262
John: Wow.

612
00:16:55,329 --> 00:16:57,298
That is both callous and also

613
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:58,465
completely besides the point,

614
00:16:58,532 --> 00:16:59,500
because the phrase "it could

615
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:01,135
have been worse" can be applied

616
00:17:01,201 --> 00:17:01,635
to literally anything.

617
00:17:01,702 --> 00:17:03,437
In fact, one of the only things

618
00:17:03,504 --> 00:17:05,005
it cannot apply to is

619
00:17:05,072 --> 00:17:05,573
Richard sackler's statement

620
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:10,344
regarding those 59 deaths.

621
00:17:10,411 --> 00:17:11,879
And I have to say, I'm just not

622
00:17:11,946 --> 00:17:17,484
sure the full horror of that

623
00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:20,588
comment comes across when you

624
00:17:20,654 --> 00:17:22,122
just hear a guy
reading it on TV.

625
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:22,856
And the problem is, we have to

626
00:17:22,923 --> 00:17:23,557
use clips like that because

627
00:17:23,624 --> 00:17:25,159
there are no clips
of Richard sackler.

628
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:25,926
He never does interviews.

629
00:17:25,993 --> 00:17:26,827
Even that photo is one of only a

630
00:17:26,894 --> 00:17:28,295
small handful we could find.

631
00:17:28,362 --> 00:17:29,430
And think of how remarkable that

632
00:17:29,496 --> 00:17:30,798
is in and of itself.

633
00:17:30,864 --> 00:17:32,166
He's an incredibly rich man, and

634
00:17:32,232 --> 00:17:33,400
it's genuinely easier to find

635
00:17:33,467 --> 00:17:35,169
multiple image options of birds

636
00:17:35,235 --> 00:17:37,438
standing on turtles or babies

637
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:41,075
that look like Wallace Shawn.

638
00:17:41,141 --> 00:17:42,409
And lets all agree, those babies

639
00:17:42,476 --> 00:17:48,983
look a lot like Wallace Shawn.

640
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:50,217
And this ‐‐ this invisibility

641
00:17:50,284 --> 00:17:51,185
feels deliberate.

642
00:17:51,251 --> 00:17:51,952
And whether it is or not, it has

643
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:52,987
definitely been convenient for

644
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:54,121
Richard sackler, because it's

645
00:17:54,188 --> 00:17:55,356
honestly hard to tell the story

646
00:17:55,422 --> 00:18:00,127
of his time at purdue
without any video.

647
00:18:00,194 --> 00:18:01,428
There is only so long anyone

648
00:18:01,495 --> 00:18:02,196
will listen to someone at a desk

649
00:18:02,262 --> 00:18:03,364
reading from court documents.

650
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,766
Trust me, I know that.

651
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:09,003
I'm painfully aware of that.

652
00:18:09,069 --> 00:18:10,070
So tonight, we've actually done

653
00:18:10,137 --> 00:18:11,672
something unusual.

654
00:18:11,739 --> 00:18:13,173
To help you get the emotional

655
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,208
impact of Richard sackler's

656
00:18:14,274 --> 00:18:17,344
actual words, we got
an actor to play him.

657
00:18:17,411 --> 00:18:18,212
So let's ‐‐ let's try that last

658
00:18:18,278 --> 00:18:19,346
quote again.

659
00:18:19,413 --> 00:18:20,614
Richard sackler, a news article

660
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:21,715
about oxycontin addiction says

661
00:18:21,782 --> 00:18:23,784
it's caused 59 deaths
in a single state.

662
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:27,521
How do you respond?

663
00:18:27,588 --> 00:18:29,890
This is not too bad.

664
00:18:29,957 --> 00:18:31,659
It could have been far worse.

665
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:33,160
John: That's right.

666
00:18:33,227 --> 00:18:35,596
We got Michael fucking Keaton.

667
00:18:35,663 --> 00:18:38,832
Because ‐‐ and
I'll tell you why.

668
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:40,200
Because when you're casting for

669
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:41,035
a shadowy heir to a vast fortune

670
00:18:41,101 --> 00:18:42,403
who doesn't like to be in the

671
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:43,871
limelight, you go Batman.

672
00:18:43,937 --> 00:18:46,540
And, look, that helps
a little bit, right?

673
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:47,875
Here, let's try another one.

674
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:49,043
As evidence mounted that oxy was

675
00:18:49,109 --> 00:18:50,544
causing widespread addiction,

676
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:51,645
sackler urged the company to

677
00:18:51,712 --> 00:18:54,248
publicly blame those
who were addicted.

678
00:18:54,314 --> 00:18:58,218
Michael Keaton, what
did he actually write?

679
00:18:58,285 --> 00:18:59,453
We have to hammer on the

680
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,455
abusers in every way possible.

681
00:19:01,522 --> 00:19:05,359
They are the culprits
and the problem.

682
00:19:05,426 --> 00:19:14,668
They are reckless criminals.

683
00:19:14,735 --> 00:19:16,070
John: Sackler
genuinely wrote that.

684
00:19:16,136 --> 00:19:17,104
Not only does that come off as

685
00:19:17,171 --> 00:19:17,705
malicious and cold‐hearted, it

686
00:19:17,771 --> 00:19:18,272
also doesn't make any sense.

687
00:19:18,338 --> 00:19:19,173
He's furious at people who are

688
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:20,274
part of the problem, but the

689
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,141
people he's angry at helped make

690
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,643
him incredibly rich.

691
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,877
You don't see Adam levine

692
00:19:23,944 --> 00:19:25,145
releasing a song condemning

693
00:19:25,212 --> 00:19:26,547
horny middle‐aged women because

694
00:19:26,613 --> 00:19:28,716
that would be hypocritical.

695
00:19:28,782 --> 00:19:30,117
Who do you think made you who

696
00:19:30,184 --> 00:19:36,390
you are, Adam?

697
00:19:36,457 --> 00:19:37,057
It's your "just dangerous

698
00:19:37,124 --> 00:19:37,825
enough for suburban moms to

699
00:19:37,891 --> 00:19:38,459
masturbate to" energy that got

700
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:39,259
you where you are today.

701
00:19:39,326 --> 00:19:43,330
Show some respect
for your base, son.

702
00:19:43,397 --> 00:19:45,065
Now, now, for legal reasons, I

703
00:19:45,132 --> 00:19:46,366
have to tell you the sacklers

704
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:47,668
and purdue insist the family

705
00:19:47,735 --> 00:19:49,169
didn't cause the opioid crisis

706
00:19:49,236 --> 00:19:50,471
and vigorously deny the claims

707
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:51,739
in the lawsuits we've mentioned,

708
00:19:51,805 --> 00:19:52,706
saying that Richard sackler's

709
00:19:52,773 --> 00:19:54,441
comments have been taken out of

710
00:19:54,508 --> 00:19:55,142
context, with quotes

711
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:56,443
cherry‐picked from among tens of

712
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,644
millions of other emails and

713
00:19:57,711 --> 00:19:59,813
business documents.

714
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,715
But two things about that.

715
00:20:01,782 --> 00:20:02,583
First, whenever they've added

716
00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:04,918
context, it hasn't
really helped much.

717
00:20:04,985 --> 00:20:06,086
For instance, their explanation

718
00:20:06,153 --> 00:20:08,055
for sackler saying the news of

719
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:10,090
59 deaths was "not too bad" was

720
00:20:10,157 --> 00:20:11,391
that he was "merely commenting

721
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:16,163
about the nature of recent press

722
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,165
coverage," which is not better

723
00:20:18,232 --> 00:20:19,166
in any meaningful way.

724
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:20,000
As for that "blizzard of

725
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:20,968
prescriptions" line, they've

726
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:22,269
claimed the full context for

727
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:22,970
that is that his remarks were an

728
00:20:23,036 --> 00:20:24,204
allusion to his delayed arrival

729
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:25,672
at that event due to the

730
00:20:25,739 --> 00:20:29,376
well‐known blizzard of 1996.

731
00:20:29,443 --> 00:20:32,079
Which, again, in no
way exonerates him.

732
00:20:32,146 --> 00:20:33,046
"Oh, hey, guys.

733
00:20:33,113 --> 00:20:34,081
It's not like Richard was

734
00:20:34,148 --> 00:20:35,048
recklessly and callously

735
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:35,916
anticipating oxycontin's

736
00:20:35,983 --> 00:20:38,452
popularity while
it was sunny out.

737
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:39,853
It was snowing.

738
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,523
Hello?"

739
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:44,024
And the thing is, for a family

740
00:20:44,091 --> 00:20:45,292
that complains about a lack of

741
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:46,693
context, they have fought

742
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,695
tirelessly to withhold it,

743
00:20:48,762 --> 00:20:51,532
because time and again, they

744
00:20:51,598 --> 00:20:52,699
have settled cases on the

745
00:20:52,766 --> 00:20:53,801
condition that evidence will be

746
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:56,937
sealed and unavailable
to the public.

747
00:20:57,004 --> 00:20:57,871
In fact, a few years back,

748
00:20:57,938 --> 00:20:59,239
purdue settled a lawsuit with

749
00:20:59,306 --> 00:21:00,841
Kentucky on the condition that

750
00:21:00,908 --> 00:21:01,441
the state a. G. Destroy

751
00:21:01,508 --> 00:21:04,077
17 million pages of documents.

752
00:21:04,144 --> 00:21:05,913
17 million pages.

753
00:21:05,979 --> 00:21:07,314
That's an actual blizzard of

754
00:21:07,381 --> 00:21:08,549
context that they did not want

755
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:10,284
anyone to see.

756
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,552
And you can kind of see why,

757
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:13,120
because just the glimpses of

758
00:21:13,187 --> 00:21:14,388
information we've seen recently

759
00:21:14,454 --> 00:21:16,156
resulted in that guggenheim

760
00:21:16,223 --> 00:21:17,491
protest, which, in turn, led to

761
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:18,625
the museum deciding to stop

762
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:21,028
taking funding
from the sacklers.

763
00:21:21,094 --> 00:21:22,129
And the guggenheim is not the

764
00:21:22,196 --> 00:21:24,798
only institution cutting ties.

765
00:21:24,865 --> 00:21:26,233
The sacklers and London's

766
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,534
national portrait gallery have

767
00:21:27,601 --> 00:21:28,836
mutually agreed to call off a

768
00:21:28,902 --> 00:21:38,011
planned donation $1.3
million donation.

769
00:21:38,078 --> 00:21:38,779
John: It's true, the

770
00:21:38,846 --> 00:21:39,646
portrait gallery bailed on the

771
00:21:39,713 --> 00:21:40,380
sacklers too.

772
00:21:40,447 --> 00:21:41,281
And I know that, as punishments

773
00:21:41,348 --> 00:21:45,085
go, getting to keep $1.3 million

774
00:21:45,152 --> 00:21:46,520
doesn't sound all
that fucking bad.

775
00:21:46,587 --> 00:21:47,254
But keep in mind that these

776
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:47,921
people have infinite money and

777
00:21:47,988 --> 00:21:49,423
seem to enjoy nothing more than

778
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:50,657
using it to purchase
social status.

779
00:21:50,724 --> 00:21:51,325
So not getting to put their name

780
00:21:51,391 --> 00:21:54,127
on things may be a
real punishment.

781
00:21:54,194 --> 00:21:55,462
But I would argue that should

782
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:56,730
only be half of it.

783
00:21:56,797 --> 00:21:58,098
The other half is having to put

784
00:21:58,165 --> 00:21:59,333
their name on the opioid crisis

785
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:01,368
they've fought so hard to

786
00:22:01,435 --> 00:22:03,303
distance themselves from.

787
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,671
And that public accounting is

788
00:22:04,738 --> 00:22:08,609
starting to become possible

789
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:09,977
despite the fact that

790
00:22:10,043 --> 00:22:10,544
Richard sackler has barely

791
00:22:10,611 --> 00:22:11,378
appeared in public.

792
00:22:11,445 --> 00:22:12,479
And there's actually a

793
00:22:12,546 --> 00:22:14,114
tantalizing development, because

794
00:22:14,181 --> 00:22:14,748
a few weeks ago, the transcript

795
00:22:14,815 --> 00:22:15,816
of a video deposition that

796
00:22:15,883 --> 00:22:16,817
Richard sackler gave in that

797
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:18,485
Kentucky case ‐‐ the case,

798
00:22:18,552 --> 00:22:19,152
remember, where 17 million

799
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:20,420
documents were destroyed ‐‐

800
00:22:20,487 --> 00:22:22,756
leaked to pro publica
and stat news.

801
00:22:22,823 --> 00:22:24,558
This is it right here.

802
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,426
This is the thing purdue really

803
00:22:26,493 --> 00:22:30,731
didn't want anyone to see.

804
00:22:30,797 --> 00:22:32,699
And there is some
damning stuff in here.

805
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:33,500
The really effective thing would

806
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:34,701
be to see the video of this

807
00:22:34,768 --> 00:22:35,903
deposition, but purdue is

808
00:22:35,969 --> 00:22:37,604
fighting ferociously hard to

809
00:22:37,671 --> 00:22:39,640
keep it under seal,
which benefits them.

810
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:41,141
As you've seen tonight,

811
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:42,142
newscasters reading quotes will

812
00:22:42,209 --> 00:22:44,044
only get you so far.

813
00:22:44,111 --> 00:22:46,680
But we have the deposition, and

814
00:22:46,747 --> 00:22:47,714
you should know, Michael Keaton

815
00:22:47,781 --> 00:22:49,716
is not the only actor we got to

816
00:22:49,783 --> 00:22:51,418
play Richard sackler.

817
00:22:51,485 --> 00:22:52,953
In fact, we got multiple actors

818
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,289
to read parts of sackler's

819
00:22:55,355 --> 00:22:59,459
deposition, word‐for‐word.

820
00:22:59,526 --> 00:23:00,227
And who better to convey the

821
00:23:00,294 --> 00:23:01,261
arrogance of an early exchange

822
00:23:01,328 --> 00:23:02,462
about sackler's involvement in

823
00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:03,263
purdue than someone responsible

824
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,431
for playing one of the greatest

825
00:23:04,498 --> 00:23:08,168
drug dealers in
television history?

826
00:23:08,235 --> 00:23:10,604
On July 30th of 2014, were

827
00:23:10,671 --> 00:23:14,675
you a director of
purdue pharma inc?

828
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:17,277
Not that I'm aware.

829
00:23:17,344 --> 00:23:18,312
This is an affidavit filed in

830
00:23:18,378 --> 00:23:21,248
the Southern district
of West Virginia.

831
00:23:21,315 --> 00:23:27,020
And does that appear
to be your name?

832
00:23:27,087 --> 00:23:29,356
That does.

833
00:23:29,423 --> 00:23:33,126
And it's dated July 30, 2014.

834
00:23:33,193 --> 00:23:34,895
It says "declaration of

835
00:23:34,962 --> 00:23:36,396
Dr. Richard s. Sackler.

836
00:23:36,463 --> 00:23:38,265
I am a director of

837
00:23:38,332 --> 00:23:39,466
purdue pharma inc, the general

838
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:41,768
partner of purdue pharma llp.

839
00:23:41,835 --> 00:23:45,605
I've held this
position since 1990."

840
00:23:45,672 --> 00:23:46,740
If that's what it says, then

841
00:23:46,807 --> 00:23:49,276
that's what it says.

842
00:23:49,343 --> 00:23:50,477
John: Wow, Richard sackler

843
00:23:50,544 --> 00:23:53,413
came off like a real
dick there, right?

844
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,548
Certainly more so than if I'd

845
00:23:54,614 --> 00:23:55,849
just read that to you.

846
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:56,783
And since we had Bryan cranston,

847
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,285
we didn't stop there.

848
00:23:58,352 --> 00:23:59,820
Because this deposition also

849
00:23:59,886 --> 00:24:01,688
contains an excerpt of a speech

850
00:24:01,755 --> 00:24:03,724
that sackler gave when oxycontin

851
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:04,591
was launched, bragging about how

852
00:24:04,658 --> 00:24:07,194
quickly purdue got the
fda to approve it.

853
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,328
So we had him go full

854
00:24:08,395 --> 00:24:12,632
Walter white on that one too.

855
00:24:12,699 --> 00:24:15,402
This didn't just happen.

856
00:24:15,469 --> 00:24:16,670
It was a deftly coordinated

857
00:24:16,737 --> 00:24:19,139
planned event that took dozens

858
00:24:19,206 --> 00:24:22,342
of workers years of
effort to succeed.

859
00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:23,877
The most demanding new drug

860
00:24:23,944 --> 00:24:25,912
approval package for any

861
00:24:25,979 --> 00:24:27,180
analgesic product ever submitted

862
00:24:27,247 --> 00:24:30,417
didn't languish at the agency.

863
00:24:30,484 --> 00:24:32,252
Unlike the years that other

864
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:34,821
filings linger at fda, this

865
00:24:34,888 --> 00:24:40,527
product was approved
in 11 months, 14 days.

866
00:24:40,594 --> 00:24:42,396
Our previous best approval time

867
00:24:42,462 --> 00:24:44,398
for other products was measured

868
00:24:44,464 --> 00:24:52,039
in years, not months.

869
00:24:52,105 --> 00:24:55,409
John: God, I felt that
in my fucking bones.

870
00:24:55,475 --> 00:24:57,778
And, look, sure, we
could've stopped there.

871
00:24:57,844 --> 00:24:59,746
Those two actors are
already incredible.

872
00:24:59,813 --> 00:25:03,150
But then we remembered,
this is hbo.

873
00:25:03,216 --> 00:25:05,352
And if we want someone to read

874
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:07,254
the shit out of another

875
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:13,560
email that Richard
sackler wrote, this one

876
00:25:13,627 --> 00:25:21,301
characterizing his
devotion to oxycontin,

877
00:25:21,334 --> 00:25:22,669
we have access to the cast of

878
00:25:22,736 --> 00:25:23,503
another iconic drug drama.

879
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,305
Brace yourselves, everyone.

880
00:25:25,372 --> 00:25:26,373
Omar comin'.

881
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,407
You won't believe how

882
00:25:27,474 --> 00:25:28,175
committed I am to make oxycontin

883
00:25:28,241 --> 00:25:29,242
a huge success.

884
00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:30,310
It is almost that I've dedicated

885
00:25:30,377 --> 00:25:30,911
my life to it.

886
00:25:30,977 --> 00:25:32,012
John: Indeed.

887
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:32,846
And, look, the only problem is,

888
00:25:32,913 --> 00:25:34,581
all of these actors
are pretty cool.

889
00:25:34,648 --> 00:25:36,783
And Richard sackler
decidedly is not.

890
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:37,884
And so to embody the fact that

891
00:25:37,951 --> 00:25:39,419
he responded "I don't know" more

892
00:25:39,486 --> 00:25:40,187
than 100 times during his

893
00:25:40,253 --> 00:25:42,055
deposition, we asked

894
00:25:42,122 --> 00:25:43,090
Richard kind to read just a

895
00:25:43,156 --> 00:25:48,895
selection of them.

896
00:25:48,962 --> 00:25:52,132
How much money has purdue or

897
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:52,566
purdue pharma made?

898
00:25:52,632 --> 00:25:55,802
I don't know.

899
00:25:55,869 --> 00:25:57,804
Do know how much the sackler

900
00:25:57,871 --> 00:25:59,405
family has made up a
sale of oxycontin?

901
00:25:59,438 --> 00:26:03,009
I don't know.

902
00:26:03,076 --> 00:26:04,611
Who is Lydia Johnson?

903
00:26:04,678 --> 00:26:05,345
I don't know.

904
00:26:05,378 --> 00:26:05,712
I don't know.

905
00:26:05,745 --> 00:26:06,413
I don't know.

906
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,147
I don't know.

907
00:26:07,214 --> 00:26:10,650
I don't know.

908
00:26:10,717 --> 00:26:13,619
How many purdue
entities are there?

909
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,422
I don't know!

910
00:26:15,489 --> 00:26:16,256
John: Pretty effective, huh?

911
00:26:16,323 --> 00:26:17,090
And Richard sackler might say,

912
00:26:17,157 --> 00:26:18,692
"I didn't sound like that," but

913
00:26:18,758 --> 00:26:19,559
we don't know that if we can't

914
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:20,494
see the tape, which is why he

915
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,963
should absolutely allow
it to be released.

916
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:23,964
But if he doesn't, we can only

917
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,232
imagine what was going on during

918
00:26:25,298 --> 00:26:26,566
his deposition.

919
00:26:26,633 --> 00:26:27,701
For instance, maybe he was

920
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:28,902
sloppily eating a Turkey

921
00:26:28,969 --> 00:26:30,170
sandwich during this actual

922
00:26:30,237 --> 00:26:35,242
exchange about
oxycontin addiction.

923
00:26:35,308 --> 00:26:36,776
Have you made any effort, or

924
00:26:36,843 --> 00:26:37,577
as we sit here today, do you

925
00:26:37,644 --> 00:26:38,979
know how many patients who took

926
00:26:39,045 --> 00:26:40,113
oxycontin in Kentucky became

927
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,083
dependent or addicted?

928
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,484
No.

929
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:46,453
Do you believe that an

930
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,654
inappropriate number of patients

931
00:26:47,721 --> 00:26:48,588
or an excessive number of

932
00:26:48,655 --> 00:26:49,723
patients who took oxycontin in

933
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:53,527
Kentucky became
addicted or dependent?

934
00:26:53,593 --> 00:26:55,262
No.

935
00:26:55,328 --> 00:26:56,429
Do you know or has purdue

936
00:26:56,496 --> 00:26:57,931
made any effort to ascertain how

937
00:26:57,998 --> 00:26:59,399
many people who were started on

938
00:26:59,466 --> 00:27:01,101
oxycontin wound up becoming

939
00:27:01,168 --> 00:27:02,702
dependent and moving on to

940
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:05,071
heroin at some point?

941
00:27:05,138 --> 00:27:09,809
No.

942
00:27:09,876 --> 00:27:11,344
John: Why would he eat a

943
00:27:11,411 --> 00:27:14,181
sandwich during such a
serious deposition?

944
00:27:14,247 --> 00:27:15,749
I mean, yes, maybe he didn't,

945
00:27:15,815 --> 00:27:16,750
but it would be so easy for

946
00:27:16,816 --> 00:27:21,454
Richard sackler to
prove he didn't.

947
00:27:21,521 --> 00:27:22,589
The point is, until he does,

948
00:27:22,656 --> 00:27:25,392
we've uploaded videos of four

949
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:26,693
different Richard sacklers

950
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,028
reading extracts from his emails

951
00:27:28,094 --> 00:27:28,862
and deposition to

952
00:27:28,929 --> 00:27:30,363
sacklergallery.com, which I'm

953
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,498
sure they'll enjoy.

954
00:27:31,565 --> 00:27:32,566
They love having their names on

955
00:27:32,632 --> 00:27:34,634
fucking galleries.

956
00:27:34,701 --> 00:27:35,936
We've also linked to various

957
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:37,070
state lawsuits at the site so

958
00:27:37,137 --> 00:27:40,807
that you can read
them for yourself.

959
00:27:40,874 --> 00:27:42,175
The point here is,

960
00:27:42,242 --> 00:27:43,443
Richard sackler's deposition

961
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,644
should not be something purdue

962
00:27:44,711 --> 00:27:46,012
gets to bury like it's buried so

963
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,247
many other things
over the years.

964
00:27:47,314 --> 00:27:48,048
So please go to the website and

965
00:27:48,114 --> 00:27:50,050
watch and use the
clips as you see fit.

966
00:27:50,116 --> 00:27:51,284
So if Richard sackler wanted

967
00:27:51,351 --> 00:27:51,918
context, then guess what?

968
00:27:51,985 --> 00:27:55,922
This is it.

969
00:27:55,989 --> 00:27:56,823
