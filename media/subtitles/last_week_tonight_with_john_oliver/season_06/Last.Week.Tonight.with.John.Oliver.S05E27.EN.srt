00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,080
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,440
SEASON VI
EPISODE 27

3
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,560
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,160
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,000
A quick recap of the week.

6
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,640
We begin with Stupid Watergate II,
the least-wanted sequel ever,

7
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,960
closely followed by every
"Pirates of the Caribbean" one.

8
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,360
Another week of damning
revelations for the president,

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,440
with the biggest
coming on Tuesday.

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,960
The top U.S. diplomat
in Ukraine, Bill Taylor,

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,640
is directly linking Trump to the heart
of the impeachment inquiry.

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,480
Democrats say there
were audible gasps and sighs

13
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,200
as Taylor detailed the White House's
pressure campaign.

14
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,840
It's not even noon, right, and this is
my most disturbing day in Congress.

15
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,680
That is a big statement. Up until now,
the most disturbing day in Congress

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,800
was the day Orrin Hatch
got bangs.

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,240
I respect you for trying something
new, Orrin, but absolutely not.

18
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,480
Information emerging
in the Ukraine probe

19
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,800
does not look good
for the White House,

20
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,640
which is why Trump's supporters
attacked the impeachment process.

21
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,000
Republicans staged
an invasion of a closed-door hearing,

22
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,800
claiming they'd been shut out.

23
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,040
A claim slightly undercut
by the fact that 47 Republicans,

24
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,480
a quarter of those in the House,
were already able to attend.

25
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,880
And as if things could not
get any dumber,

26
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,080
there was this amazing story
on Friday afternoon.

27
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,200
One of president's top defenders,
personal attorney Rudy Giuliani

28
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,640
raising eyebrows after butt-dialing
an NBC News reporter.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,360
Rudy Giuliani
butt-dialed an NBC News reporter

30
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,080
and could be heard saying
non-suspicious-sounding things like:

31
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,200
"The problem
is we need some money."

32
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,920
This isn't even a one-off. Giuliani
butt-dials reporters all the time,

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,320
one reporter tweeted: "everyone
has a good Rudy butt dial story."

34
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,120
Which begs the question:
how is he doing this so much?

35
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,720
It's difficult to butt-dial
someone with a smartphone!

36
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,480
Your butt has to unlock the phone,
scroll through your contacts

37
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,560
to find the reporter
and then dial.

38
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,960
How often does Rudy
sit on his phone?

39
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,760
How wriggly is he when he sits?

40
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,440
I don't know how this
is gonna get any stupider,

41
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,920
but I am sure that it will,
just as sure as I am

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,360
that Rudy is butt-dialing
another reporter right now.

43
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,520
Instead of getting dragged
down that wormhole,

44
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,200
let's move on to the other ongoing
fiasco of this week, Brexit.

45
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,600
The term coined to describe
Britain's exit from the E.U.

46
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,880
that combines the words "Bad idea",
"Really bad idea," "Extremely bad",

47
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,800
"Idea" and "Toodle-oo!"

48
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,240
"Toodle-oo" let's you know
Britain's involved,

49
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,640
otherwise the word's
complete nonsense.

50
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,760
The U.K.'s deadline to leave the E.U.
is this Thursday,

51
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,120
making it
a so-called Halloween Brexit.

52
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,040
It is the worst thing to be added to
Halloween since, lest we forget,

53
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,120
Playboy Magazine's 2014
"Sexy John Oliver" costume.

54
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,680
That was real.
What were you thinking, Playboy?

55
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,520
The original John Oliver
is already the sexy one.

56
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,760
You're putting a hat on a hat, guys.
That's a two-hat situation right there.

57
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,040
Boris Johnson, U.K. prime minister and
dumb person's idea of a smart person,

58
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,920
has been promising
to meet the deadline,

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,720
insisting he will not
ask for an extension.

60
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,760
Can you make a promise
to the British public

61
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,280
that you will not go back to Brussels
and ask for another delay to Brexit?

62
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,440
Yes. I can.

63
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,440
I'd rather be dead in a ditch.

64
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,120
"Dead in a ditch." Now,
that might sound dramatic,

65
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,960
but it's an easy enough transition
for someone whose hair, wardrobe

66
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,880
and general aesthetic might be best
described as "big ditch energy".

67
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,720
Boris's hopes have
come crashing down,

68
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,920
as he returned from Brussels
with a new Brexit plan

69
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,080
and had to put it before
the House of Commons for a vote.

70
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,920
Hundreds of thousands of protestors
were marching against Brexit,

71
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,040
including one guy with a sign
that read, "I am so tired".

72
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,040
I don't know
that I've ever identified

73
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,160
with a protest sign at a rally
any more than that one.

74
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,720
Unfortunately for Boris,
Parliament passed an amendment that,

75
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,640
for complicated reasons that
you do not need to know,

76
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,080
forced a Brexit delay,
much to the delight of the protesters.

77
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,240
And then the moment when it was clear
there would be no Brexit deal today.

78
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,080
The agony continues,
doesn't it?

79
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,360
I know, yes, that's boring, but that's
the position that he's put us in.

80
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,280
I can think of nothing more
quintessentially British

81
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,000
than viewing agony as A, boring
and B, a victory.

82
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,600
Never change, you sad, grey,
repressed bastards.

83
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,560
Boris was now required to request
a three-month Brexit delay,

84
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,680
the thing that he would rather be
dead in a ditch than do.

85
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,840
While he flirted with ignoring that law,
he did obey it, albeit, with a twist.

86
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,520
The prime minister did as he was
told, but in his own style.

87
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,680
Here is the extension request sent
last night, a photocopy left unsigned,

88
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,840
followed by another letter
saying the opposite.

89
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,400
He sent one un-signed letter saying
what he was supposed to say

90
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,160
and a signed one,
saying what he really thought.

91
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,760
I know this is not the point, here,
but: how are signatures still matters?

92
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,120
We live in a time when robots exist but
if you wanna make something official,

93
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,280
you need to write your name weird.

94
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,760
Yes,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

95
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,400
my client's name is
on the murder confession.

96
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,360
But I ask you this:
is it squiggly?

97
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,640
E.U. is weighing the extension request

98
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,920
and Boris spent the week
trying to sell his deal to MPs,

99
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,200
asking them to at least
support the bill in principle.

100
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,360
Which some of them said they were
willing to do, despite a hurdle.

101
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,280
- Have you managed to read it?
- No.

102
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,160
- Have you tried?
- No.

103
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,760
- You haven't tried to read this?
- Not yet.

104
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,680
- Or the explanatory notes?
- No.

105
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,600
- Or the impact assessment?
- No.

106
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,280
- Debate starts at lunchtime.
- At half past 12.

107
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,440
He was gonna sign off on
an important deal without reading it.

108
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,160
That's what 'NSync did in the 90's
and this guy stole millions from them.

109
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,880
Though, deal aside, they should have
known not to trust him.

110
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,120
Look at that guy!
If anyone is going to rip you off,

111
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,840
it's gonna be him.

112
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,200
After this week, there is no way that
Brexit will happen on October 31st.

113
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,200
Boris is now trying a different route
to gain support for passing a deal.

114
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,680
He's asking Parliament to agree
to a new election in December,

115
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,960
but it is not clear that
Parliament will even agree to that.

116
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,360
Many voters don't have
an appetite for it.

117
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,440
The delay in delivering Brexit

118
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,640
has made some people say
they won't vote ever again.

119
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,120
What about the 12th of December?
In the run up to Christmas.

120
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,280
- Is that a good date?
- No, not really, is it?

121
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,760
I don't know what to say about it.
I don't even watch it,

122
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,520
it's got on me nerves...

123
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,360
- You will be voting, though?
- Again? I won't bother.

124
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,680
- If there's a general election.
- No.

125
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,320
This is the most consequential thing
to happen to Britain in a generation

126
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,040
and it seems the current sides are
"I'm so tired", "I haven't read it",

127
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,240
"I can't be bothered"
and "I'd rather be dead in a ditch."

128
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,120
Good luck, Britain. And now this.

129
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:06,040
Newscasters React To The Houston
Astros Losing The First Two Games

130
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,680
Of The World Series,
In The Most Predictable Way Possible.

131
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,800
A shocker in Houston.

132
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,400
I told myself, I wasn't gonna say:
"Houston we have a problem."

133
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,200
Houston, we have a problem.

134
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,680
I think that is how they are
feeling in Houston this morning.

135
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,160
The Astros...
Houston, do we have a problem?

136
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,480
Houston, we have a problem.

137
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,680
Houston, we have a problem.

138
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,120
I hear "We have a problem"
and I'm kind of getting sick of that.

139
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,240
Houston, we have a problem.

140
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,680
We'll have more highlights in a bit.

141
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,960
- Houston, we have a problem.
- Great.

142
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,680
I'm sure
that was done many times.

143
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,640
Moving on. Our main story
concerns Donald Trump.

144
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,880
The first president elected without
any prior experience as a human being.

145
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,360
Trump had some major news for us:
that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,

146
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,440
the head of ISIS,
had been killed.

147
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,560
In classic Trump fashion,
he was able to take something positive

148
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,360
and express it in the weirdest
imaginable way.

149
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,000
Here is how
he described the operation.

150
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,040
They did a lot of shooting
and they did a lot of blasting.

151
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,200
Even not going through the front door,
you think you go through the door.

152
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,720
If you're a normal person, you say:
"Knock knock. May I come in?"

153
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,760
They blasted
their way into the house.

154
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,840
They had a big hole and they ran in
and got everybody by surprise.

155
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,480
What are you doing?

156
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,360
Did Trump only just learn
how soldiers work?

157
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,840
These guys are amazing.
They got these chameleon suits

158
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,640
and big shooties and blasties,
they don't say "Knock knock".

159
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,920
They don't do that
like a normal person.

160
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,600
They go through big, beautiful
holes. And they shout "Surprise!"

161
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,440
A lot of people are learning
about this for the first time.

162
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,880
You haven't yet heard Trump pay tribute
to one crucial member of the team.

163
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:15,040
A K-9, as they call... I call it a dog.
A beautiful dog. A talented dog.

164
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,160
I call them dogs, not like others
who call them "furry lizards"

165
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,760
or "barking cats" or "elephants"
but smaller and different.

166
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,280
To me, they are
and forever will be "dogs",

167
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,600
that's my term for them
that I made up!

168
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,760
While Baghdadi being gone
is clearly great news,

169
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,120
I'd like to focus on a different
decision Trump recently made

170
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,240
in the same region and one that
could have more long-term ramifications

171
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,480
and tells us much more about his
decision-making as commander-in-chief.

172
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,920
A move that alarmed many, even
his cheerleaders on "Fox & Friends".

173
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,440
The US is going to start pulling troops
from Turkey's border in Syria.

174
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,760
The White House says it's clearing
the way for Turkish troops to invade.

175
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,680
A disastrous series of events,
I hope the president will rethink this.

176
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,720
You know things are bad for Trump

177
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,720
when he's even lost the support
of "Fox & Friends", whose slogan is:

178
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,480
"President Trump's Dick Is 17 Inches
Long and Thick as a Tree Trunk!"

179
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,360
That's the real slogan.
What happened here was,

180
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,200
Trump suddenly and against
the counsel of nearly all his advisers,

181
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,360
pulled back troops along
the Syria-Turkey border here,

182
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,840
who had been working with
Kurdish-led forces to contain ISIS.

183
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,760
Our presence there helped protect
Kurdish civilians from Turkey,

184
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,880
ISIS and the Syrian government.

185
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,000
Our troop withdrawal
had immediate consequences.

186
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,760
Turkish forces moved in
almost as soon as we left

187
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,400
and over a hundred civilians
have been killed,

188
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,040
with nearly 200000 displaced,
a catastrophe.

189
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,120
This move has been
nearly universally condemned.

190
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,560
It's been criticized by Bernie Sanders
and Elizabeth Warren,

191
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,640
Mitch McConnell
and Lindsey Graham,

192
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,840
the last of whom
did not mince his words.

193
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,960
To abandon these people
is a real shit show

194
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,440
and I'm hoping Trump
will reconsider.

195
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,720
He's about to make the biggest
mistake of his presidency.

196
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,240
A shit show!

197
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,320
Lindsey Graham always looks like
he's just said that exact phrase.

198
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,960
I come into this Bojangles'
every Sunday,

199
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,560
and I have never
seen service like this.

200
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,840
My chicken is damp,
my biscuit is cold

201
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,480
and my day is ruined.

202
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,320
This is a real shit show right here.
I will take my order to go. To go!

203
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,720
I am flustered!

204
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,880
When the consequences
of a decision are that dire

205
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,200
and the condemnation
that widespread,

206
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,960
it might be worth asking:
what exactly happened?

207
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,480
Why did Trump decide to do it?
What might the ramifications be?

208
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,520
Let's start with what happened.
The situation in Syria is complex,

209
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,440
you can be forgiven for not
fully understanding it.

210
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,160
What is much less forgivable

211
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,280
is pretending to understand it
when you clearly don't.

212
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,600
It's a very semi-complicated,
not too complicated if you're smart,

213
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,400
but it's a semi-complicated problem.

214
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,480
Good, it's only semi-complicated,
is it?

215
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,840
I'd forgotten that Trump
spent the '90s as the senior fellow

216
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,680
for Middle Eastern studies at the
Foreign Policy Research Institute

217
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,080
and not losing all his dad's money and
trying unsuccessfully to bang Madonna.

218
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,800
I forgot that, 'cause
I'm not smart like him.

219
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,600
There are more factions involved
here than we have time to cover,

220
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,880
but the important group
are the Kurds.

221
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,000
There are about 30 million of them,

222
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,720
spread mostly across Syria,
Turkey, Iraq and Iran.

223
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,160
They are the largest ethnic group
in the world without a country.

224
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,160
They're a minority wherever they live,
putting them in a precarious situation.

225
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,560
They have been close military allies
with America in the past.

226
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,640
Which is why it was odd to hear Trump
justify abandoning them like this.

227
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,840
Somebody wrote in
a very powerful article today,

228
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,920
they didn't help us in the Second
World War, with Normandy,

229
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,480
they mentioned names
of different battles.

230
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,720
But they're there to help us with their
land and that's a different thing.

231
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,600
Let me just get this straight:

232
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,440
you are mad because the Kurds didn't
help the U.S. fight in Normandy?

233
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,760
The fuck does that have
to do with anything?

234
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,880
There were also
no Kurds at the Battle of Gettysburg,

235
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,880
or helping us get to the moon.

236
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,640
All suspiciously Kurd-less missions.
Where were the Kurds?

237
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,480
Neil could've used their help
holding his ladder.

238
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,760
They were all busy, were they?
All of them?

239
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,200
The Kurds have fought multiple
times to help America,

240
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,880
including in both
the Gulf and Iraq wars.

241
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,680
The Kurds fought with the U.S. military
in at least two more wars

242
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,920
than Donald Trump
ever fucking did.

243
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,880
We turned to the Kurds in 2015,
to help us contain ISIS in Syria.

244
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,040
We provided training and air support

245
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,520
and they were the front-line
troops doing the close fighting.

246
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,440
It was a very tight partnership.

247
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,880
The U.S. military trusted their allies
so completely

248
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,560
that the Kurds were calling
in American airstrikes.

249
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,480
It's true. The Kurds would point at
something, and we would blow it up.

250
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,720
An incredible level of trust.
If I had that power, to put it mildly,

251
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,760
there would be
no more Applebee's.

252
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,320
They know what they did.

253
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,560
The Kurds' sacrifice
in that fight was significant.

254
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,880
While at least six Americans died
fighting in that region,

255
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,880
the Kurds suffered
11000 casualties.

256
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,760
That alliance is one
of the reasons why ISIS,

257
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,880
which controlled this much
territory in Syria in 2015,

258
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,920
has since lost all of it.

259
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,440
A key reason that we were able
to take out al-Baghdadi

260
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,880
was thanks
to intelligence from the Kurds.

261
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,480
They fought bravely with us

262
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,120
and the situation in northeastern
Syria was relatively stable.

263
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,400
In an instant, Trump threw
that all away. So, why?

264
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,640
Why did he do that? To hear him
tell it, it's pretty simple.

265
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,520
I don't want to be in Syria forever.
It's sand and it's death.

266
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,640
Since when does Trump avoid
areas of sand and death?

267
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,080
He owns a golf club in Florida,
where the average age

268
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
is "opposed the Civil Rights Act".

269
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,720
The guy loves sand and death!
That is part of his reductive argument

270
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,440
that America should not be stuck
in endless wars

271
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,560
and that the troops
should come home.

272
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,000
Which is at least a real,
coherent foreign policy position.

273
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,240
The problem is, the troops
aren't actually coming home.

274
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,480
Since May,

275
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,640
we've increased the number of them
deployed to the Middle East by 14000.

276
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,640
Just days after his Syria decision,
Trump made a big announcement.

277
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,520
We are sending troops
and other things to the Middle East

278
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,480
to help Saudi Arabia.

279
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,960
But are you ready?
Saudi Arabia, at my request,

280
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,000
has agreed to pay us
for everything we're doing.

281
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,280
That's a first.

282
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,400
One, this probably won't surprise you,
they have not agreed to that.

283
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,000
Two: even if they had, that would be
a weird thing to brag about!

284
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,800
The U.S. military
doesn't charge for protection,

285
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,880
because it isn't a mercenary force.

286
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,800
It's why the eagle on the U.S. seal
carries arrows and an olive branch,

287
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,240
not arrows
and a credit card reader.

288
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,760
The idea that we'll send troops
to a country that pays us

289
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,200
is in keeping with Trump's short-term,
purely transactional worldview.

290
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,240
Same philosophy led him
to suggest withdrawing troops

291
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,600
from South Korea,
they don't pay enough,

292
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,360
or to pull out of NATO
because other countries

293
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,280
aren't contributing
their share.

294
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,440
Sorry, Kurds, unless you give
Trump something he wants,

295
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,400
like Hunter Biden's email password
or Melania Trump's phone number,

296
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,240
you can apparently
expect fuck-all from him.

297
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,640
So, if this wasn't done out
of some grand principle,

298
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,360
why did it happen,
and happen so suddenly?

299
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,000
It seems Trump's decision followed
a phone call with President Erdogan.

300
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,000
For years, Turkey has struggled
with a Kurdish militant group

301
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,600
called the PKK, who are
unquestionably extreme.

302
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,800
The State Department considers
them a terrorist group,

303
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,520
and Erdogan believes that a Kurdish
group we've been working with

304
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,000
are basically the same as the PKK
and he wants them either dead

305
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,240
or nowhere near the Turkish border.

306
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,000
This isn't a new problem,
we've been basically managing

307
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,520
to balance our interest
in containing ISIS

308
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,000
with our need to manage
Erdogan's concerns for years now.

309
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,000
It has been difficult,
but we've basically done it.

310
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,680
Until Erdogan got on the phone
with Trump earlier this month

311
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,160
and told him he wanted to move
against Kurdish forces in Syria.

312
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,880
Trump said:
"Fine. We'll run away then."

313
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,960
That is a decision that has baffled
many, including Mitt Romney.

314
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,840
Erdogan basically said:
"We're coming in. Get out of the way."

315
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,320
America blinked.
Am I reading that wrong?

316
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,960
No, Mitt.
You're actually not.

317
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,360
Much like the rest of America
discovering your secret Twitter account

318
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,880
was named "Pierre Delecto",
that's real,

319
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,400
you are very much
not reading that wrong.

320
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,600
"Pierre Delecto" sounds like a name
that would've come up in "Pulp Fiction"

321
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,840
if that conversation about
French McDonald's kept going.

322
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,240
In France they call the quarter
pounder a "royale with cheese"

323
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,080
and Grimace, "Pierre Delecto".

324
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,600
But it is truly troubling,

325
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,000
the extent to which Trump has
just rolled over for Erdogan.

326
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:43,120
He called the Kurds, who fought
and died alongside the U.S. military,

327
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,360
"no angels".

328
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,200
While Trump did apparently try
to prevent a Kurdish slaughter,

329
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,400
Erdogan seemed to feel
comfortable ignoring him.

330
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,840
A letter surfaced
from President Trump to Erdogan.

331
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,920
He warned against
a Turkish military offensive,

332
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,600
and said, in decidedly
undiplomatic language:

333
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,440
"Don't be a tough guy.
Don't be a fool!"

334
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,600
Erdogan threw away the letter

335
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,600
and launched the assault
into Syria the same day.

336
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,400
Holy shit.
He didn't just ignore him,

337
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,000
Erdogan threw away
a piece of mail that day.

338
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,440
That alone is ice cold. He probably
also throws away birthday cards

339
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,240
directly after reading them,
like a monster,

340
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,480
instead of keeping them on
the kitchen counter for a week

341
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,560
and then throwing them out because,
what else are you going to do?

342
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,440
Frame it?
Of course not, it's a piece of trash.

343
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,080
But not for a week.

344
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,080
Even if you think Trump was right
to withdraw troops from the area,

345
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,360
it makes sense to do it in a way
that will cause the least damage

346
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,440
to the region,
your allies and your own interests.

347
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,400
Trump did none of that.

348
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,120
Our withdrawal was so rushed,
we had to leave a lot behind.

349
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,560
Watch this Russian reporter,
wandering around a U.S. base,

350
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,720
just hours after the troops had left.

351
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,120
They left here yesterday
at four A.M. Look here.

352
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,520
I am currently at the U.S. kitchen.
American soldiers used to eat here.

353
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,920
The fridge is full. Coca-Cola.

354
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,800
Not only did we dump
our allies without warning,

355
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,720
we left a refrigerator full of Coke
for whoever took our place.

356
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,680
Maybe the most interesting part
was watching the reporter ignore

357
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,520
the fridge full of Pepsi
right next to it.

358
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,400
Even to Russian reporters
the answer to "Is Pepsi okay?"

359
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,480
is a resounding nyet!

360
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,880
America left the region
the same way

361
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,200
you leave a party after you clogged
the toilet, quickly,

362
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,720
leaving everything behind, and forcing
someone else to deal with all the shit.

363
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,880
The consequences have been dire.

364
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,360
Kurdish-led forces were in charge
of guarding many ISIS prisoners.

365
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,240
We forced them to abandon their posts
to fight for their lives.

366
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,160
And the thing that any six-year-old
could tell you would happen next,

367
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,680
happened next.

368
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,200
The White House is trying to downplay

369
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,160
how many of the 10000 ISIS prisoners
in Syria may have escaped.

370
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,600
There were a few that got out.
A small number, relatively speaking.

371
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,120
And they've been largely recaptured.

372
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,760
That's not what the president's special
envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey, said.

373
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,040
The number is now over 100.
We do not know where they are.

374
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,640
Over 100 ISIS prisoners escaped,
and we don't know where they are.

375
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,960
Or at least, they don't know.
I have a surprise for everyone here.

376
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,680
Ladies and gentlemen:
the ISIS prisoners!

377
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,480
Fuck!
Where are they?

378
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,480
Fuck. Shit
Fucking fuck.

379
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,480
They were supposed...

380
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,640
Why did we give them shovels?
Doesn't make any sense.

381
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,840
As I was saying,
over 100 ISIS prisoners have escaped

382
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,800
and we have
no idea where they are.

383
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,480
It gets even worse here.

384
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,720
When you give a green light
to an authoritarian,

385
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,960
terrible things can happen
and terrible things very much did.

386
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,240
We saw for the first time alleged
atrocities carried out

387
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,840
by Turkish backed Arab militias.

388
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,440
This video today appears to
show Arab militias executing a Kurd

389
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,440
by the roadside as they shout
"Allahu akbar"

390
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,240
and proudly saying:
"Film me."

391
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:50,000
That is horrifying, a potential war
crime and completely avoidable.

392
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,680
Even in the face of scenes like that
and over a hundred civilian deaths,

393
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,960
Trump has tried to spin the carnage
as evidence of his tactical genius.

394
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,560
It was unconventional
what I did.

395
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,560
I said: "Sometimes you have
to let them fight a little while".

396
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,320
Then people find out
how tough the fighting is.

397
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,680
Sometimes you have to let them
fight, like two kids in a lot,

398
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
and then you pull 'em apart.

399
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,840
The fuck are you talking about?
That is not true for Syria.

400
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,520
And it's also not true for kids,
you weird monster!

401
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,440
Trump revealed what we've
essentially always known,

402
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,400
he's not just a shitty
president and a shitty person,

403
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,640
he's a shitty dad.

404
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,160
Thank god he never had
to raise any children.

405
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,280
Thankfully, the worst of the violence
appears to have abated,

406
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,760
but that is largely because,
after the U.S. left a power vacuum,

407
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,680
another major player stepped in.

408
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,760
Russia's Vladimir Putin tonight became
the new kingmaker in Syria

409
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,840
as he and President Erdogan carved up
the country between them.

410
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,720
Putin now has
a larger foothold in the region.

411
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,200
The Kurdish fighters who were
once allied with us for so long

412
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,240
have now flipped sides and struck
a deal with Syria's Bashar al-Assad,

413
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,880
to avoid being wiped out.

414
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,440
Trump has made a snap decision
where the big winners are Putin,

415
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,160
Erdogan, Assad and ISIS.

416
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,640
That is a group that you do not
want to be friendly with.

417
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,240
I believe they were all at a Cowboys
game with Ellen this weekend.

418
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,240
We're all different.
And that's okay.

419
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,840
Trump may not be bothered
particularly

420
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,800
that he's empowered so many
authoritarian leaders.

421
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,920
We know he has
a soft spot for them.

422
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,800
After Erdogan disregarded Trump's
warnings, launched a bloody campaign,

423
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,360
once he'd agreed
to a temporary cease-fire,

424
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,280
Trump went straight back
to praising him.

425
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,920
I want to thank and congratulate
President Erdogan.

426
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,440
He's a friend of mine and I'm glad
we didn't have a problem,

427
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,200
he's a hell of a leader

428
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,800
and he's a strong man,
he did the right thing.

429
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,000
Yeah, he's a strong man.
He's a strongman.

430
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,120
That's not a fucking compliment.
That's a synonym for dictator.

431
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,600
That image might sum up
the insanity of this whole situation.

432
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,680
The president, thinking
he's projecting strength,

433
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,680
fawning over an authoritarian for
deigning to pause a slaughter

434
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,240
that the president
himself had enabled.

435
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:36,560
It is so easy to criticize anyone's
policy in the region. It's complicated.

436
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,280
Any move is going to have ripple
effects, intended or otherwise.

437
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,200
Syria was one of the biggest problem
spots in Obama's foreign policy.

438
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,080
I'm not saying that it is easy
or even possible

439
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,320
to get a situation this difficult
completely right.

440
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:57,320
But it's hard to get it this wrong.
We took a stable situation,

441
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:02,440
betrayed a strategically vital ally
and damaged our reputation.

442
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,520
Watch how the Kurds treated a U.S.
convoy leaving the country.

443
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,040
Kurdish civilians, until now,
close U.S. allies

444
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,440
throwing potatoes

445
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:19,000
and yelling insults at American
troops ordered out of Syria.

446
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,240
These images tonight show
one of the lowest moments

447
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,640
of America's reputation
in the Middle East in years.

448
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,240
The lowest moments of America's
reputation in the Middle East.

449
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,040
A guy in the Middle East
once took off his shoe,

450
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,880
threw it at the president and
while the people around him watched,

451
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,360
took off his other shoe,
and also threw that at the president.

452
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,240
The more you look,
the more worrying it gets.

453
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,040
This was an unforced error. Trump
chose to do something this sudden,

454
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,960
this impetuous, and this damaging
and he's not going to change.

455
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,400
Imagine what he might do in
a crisis not of his own making.

456
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,840
That is one of the terrifying things
about the prospect of a second term

457
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,040
or, indeed,
the remaining year of this first one.

458
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,440
There is nothing more dangerous
than someone with a massive power,

459
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,600
a dictator fetish
and an inability to think

460
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,800
in anything
but transactional terms,

461
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,200
and who is stupid enough to think

462
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,880
that this is all
"not too complicated if you are smart."

463
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,720
And now this.

464
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,880
Ahead Of His Retirement,

465
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,720
A Look Back At Speaker Of The House
Of Commons, John Bercow,

466
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,560
Who Only Ever Wanted One Thing.

467
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,040
Order, the House
is very overexcited.

468
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,400
Order! Ms. Cherry,
this is very unseemly heckling.

469
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,920
Order, there's simply too much
noise in the chamber.

470
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,920
Order, very rude for members,
order!

471
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,200
Let's grow up.
Order, resume to your seats. Order.

472
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,160
- I haven't finished.
- Order!

473
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,520
Order.

474
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,640
Order!

475
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,600
Order!

476
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,880
Order!

477
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,200
Order!

478
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,400
I just want to take the opportunity
to confirm to the House

479
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,520
that the state of my throat,
which is purely temporary,

480
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,840
is not down to the consumption
of a kangaroo's testicle.

481
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,760
That's our show, thanks for watching.
See you next week, goodnight!

482
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,720
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

483
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,680
END OF EPISODE 27,
SEASON VI
