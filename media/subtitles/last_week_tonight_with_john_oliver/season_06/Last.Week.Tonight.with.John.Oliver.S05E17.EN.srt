1
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:34,428
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight"!

2
00:00:34,588 --> 00:00:37,228
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

3
00:00:37,388 --> 00:00:39,628
Just time for a quick recap
of the week,

4
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:42,307
which was a big one
for Trump and diplomacy,

5
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:46,947
two words that go together
like "fire" and "Chicago, 1871."

6
00:00:47,107 --> 00:00:48,466
Trump was overseas this week,

7
00:00:48,626 --> 00:00:50,466
meeting with his favorite
authoritarians.

8
00:00:50,626 --> 00:00:53,106
He joked with Putin about
meddling in U.S. elections,

9
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:56,065
called Saudi prince Mohammed bin Salman
"a friend of mine,"

10
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:58,265
and just this morning,
popped across the DMZ

11
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,145
<i>to North Korea</i>
<i>with Kim Jong-un,</i>

12
00:01:00,305 --> 00:01:03,904
<i>while seemingly being thrilled</i>
<i>that he'd been invited over.</i>

13
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,424
It's an honor to be with you,

14
00:01:05,584 --> 00:01:07,944
an honor that you asked me
to step over that line,

15
00:01:08,104 --> 00:01:09,783
and I was proud
to step over the line.

16
00:01:09,943 --> 00:01:13,783
I thought you might do that.
I wasn't sure, but I was ready to do it.

17
00:01:13,943 --> 00:01:15,783
And I want to thank you.
It's been great.

18
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,702
Oh, that's actually nice.

19
00:01:17,862 --> 00:01:20,902
So Trump wanted to step over the line,
was ready to do it,

20
00:01:21,062 --> 00:01:23,302
but waited until he received
affirmative consent.

21
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:25,661
What a refreshing
change of pace for him!

22
00:01:25,821 --> 00:01:28,701
Maybe--maybe Trump's mantra
going forward should be,

23
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:31,980
"Treat women with the same respect
you show murderous autocrats."

24
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,940
He's growing!
Good for him.

25
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,180
The other big diplomacy news
of the week

26
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,379
concerns Jared Kushner,
Slender Man's weird nephew.

27
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:44,059
Jared's Middle East peace plan has now
been over two years in the making,

28
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:47,418
and even before taking office,
Trump was hyping it like this:

29
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:52,777
If you can't produce peace
in the Middle East, nobody can. Okay?

30
00:01:52,937 --> 00:01:54,737
All my life, I've been hearing

31
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:57,817
that's the toughest deal
in the world to make,

32
00:01:57,977 --> 00:01:59,536
and I've seen it.

33
00:01:59,696 --> 00:02:02,776
But I have a feeling that Jared
is gonna do a great job.

34
00:02:02,936 --> 00:02:04,576
Of course he is!

35
00:02:04,736 --> 00:02:08,215
Jared's racked up an impressive list
of accomplishments in his 38 years,

36
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:12,135
from having a "very smooth, shiny face,"
to "end of list."

37
00:02:12,295 --> 00:02:14,734
Well, this week,
Jared announced

38
00:02:14,894 --> 00:02:17,774
his "Peace to Prosperity" plan
during a conference in Bahrain

39
00:02:17,934 --> 00:02:19,774
with a stirring speech.

40
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:21,933
<i>The Peace to Prosperity vision</i>

41
00:02:22,093 --> 00:02:23,453
<i>is a modern framework</i>

42
00:02:23,613 --> 00:02:26,253
<i>for a brighter</i>
<i>and more prosperous future.</i>

43
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:29,172
The man is
a once-in-a-generation orator.

44
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:32,172
He's like Cicero reincarnated
as a garbage disposal.

45
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:35,371
And look, while that may not be
Jared's real voice,

46
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:38,251
what he presented this week
is also not a real plan.

47
00:02:38,411 --> 00:02:41,890
It is a "vision" that fits somewhere
between "economic wish list"

48
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,210
and "half-remembered
rich boy wet dream,"

49
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,970
because essentially,

50
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,770
it describes
hypothetical investments

51
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,049
in Palestine and its neighbors
worth more than $50 billion,

52
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:52,889
once peace is achieved.

53
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:55,928
But achieving peace
is the really important part.

54
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:57,848
Without that,
you've got nothing.

55
00:02:58,008 --> 00:03:01,288
Jared punted announcing that part
of the plan until later this year.

56
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,807
The more you listened
to him talk about his vision,

57
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:06,007
the less he seemed
to actually say.

58
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:08,727
So how do we begin to make
this change?

59
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:11,806
We need the right plan,
and to create the right environment.

60
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:15,926
If we have a real peace, and there's not
a fear of people doing terrorism,

61
00:03:16,086 --> 00:03:18,165
then all of a sudden,
we can thin the borders

62
00:03:18,325 --> 00:03:20,845
and allow for a much faster
flow of goods and people.

63
00:03:21,005 --> 00:03:23,924
After years of thinking,
Jared's arrived at the conclusion

64
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:25,924
that the Middle East
would be better off

65
00:03:26,084 --> 00:03:28,204
if people stopped
"doing terrorism."

66
00:03:28,364 --> 00:03:31,763
Think about the chain of events
that led him to that moment.

67
00:03:31,923 --> 00:03:34,123
Jared had that idea,
"no doing terrorism,"

68
00:03:34,283 --> 00:03:37,163
and thought, "That's an awesome point.
I'll write that down."

69
00:03:37,323 --> 00:03:38,922
So he did,
and then he went to sleep,

70
00:03:39,082 --> 00:03:40,722
exhausted by the thought.

71
00:03:40,882 --> 00:03:42,962
He woke up,
read what he'd written,

72
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,761
and he was like, "Yup, nailed it.
I'm a good boy!"

73
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:47,681
Then he said that point,
unembarrassed,

74
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:50,001
out loud in front
of actual human beings.

75
00:03:50,161 --> 00:03:51,801
Which should be humiliating.

76
00:03:51,961 --> 00:03:54,480
I'm far from the only one
critical of his plan.

77
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,600
Dan Kurtzer, a former
ambassador to Israel,

78
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,399
reportedly said, "I would give
this so-called plan

79
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:01,919
a C-minus from an undergraduate
student."

80
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:04,679
Although I doubt
that actually bothers Jared,

81
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:09,598
'cause a C-minus is
the trust fund boy's A-plus.

82
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:13,677
And to give you some sense of Jared's
odds of success, I should point out,

83
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,317
no Palestinian officials
attended Jared's conference,

84
00:04:16,477 --> 00:04:18,677
possibly because they don't see
Jared, or Trump,

85
00:04:18,837 --> 00:04:21,876
as neutral mediators,
and why would they?

86
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:24,116
Jared's family is so close
to Netanyahu,

87
00:04:24,276 --> 00:04:28,795
the prime minister once stayed at their
home and slept in Jared's bedroom,

88
00:04:28,955 --> 00:04:31,595
in what I'd imagine
was Jared's racecar bed,

89
00:04:31,755 --> 00:04:35,594
under a shelf of other kids' soccer
trophies that his dad bought for him.

90
00:04:35,754 --> 00:04:37,194
And it's not just that.

91
00:04:37,354 --> 00:04:40,154
The administration recognized
Jerusalem as Israel's capital

92
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:43,153
and cut hundreds of millions
in aid to the Palestinians.

93
00:04:43,313 --> 00:04:45,633
When Netanyahu got wind
that Trump would recognize

94
00:04:45,793 --> 00:04:48,952
the Golan Heights as part of Israel,
he responded like this:

95
00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:51,432
Prime Minister Netanyahu
has announced he's naming

96
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:54,392
a controversial new settlement
in the Golan Heights

97
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:57,631
<i>after the man he calls his good friend,</i>
<i>Donald Trump.</i>

98
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:01,831
That must've been the fastest,
easiest decision in Israeli history.

99
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:03,310
"How should we thank Trump?

100
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,910
"Just slap his name on a sign.
"He'll love it.

101
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,110
"Oh--oh-- oh, shit, the Golan Heights
just went bankrupt.

102
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,709
We probably should've
seen that coming."

103
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:13,829
But maybe the clearest sign

104
00:05:13,989 --> 00:05:16,029
of how poorly thought-out
Jared's approach is

105
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:18,028
comes from this
Palestinian olive farmer.

106
00:05:18,188 --> 00:05:20,308
A few years ago,
he proposed a joint venture

107
00:05:20,468 --> 00:05:21,908
between Palestinians
and Israelis,

108
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:25,547
only to see his project then defunded
by the Trump administration.

109
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:29,707
And Jared's plan contained
a special surprise just for him.

110
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:33,906
<i>Junaidi is still bitter at how the</i>
<i>administration treated his project.</i>

111
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:36,146
<i>So imagine his surprise</i>
<i>when we told him</i>

112
00:05:36,306 --> 00:05:37,906
<i>that his face was being used</i>

113
00:05:38,066 --> 00:05:39,505
<i>in the glossy White House</i>
<i>brochure</i>

114
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:42,425
<i>promoting Jared Kushner's</i>
<i>peace plan.</i>

115
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:45,864
Did you know that they're using
your image in these proposals?

116
00:05:46,024 --> 00:05:47,904
The Kushner plan, yeah.

117
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:49,624
You didn't know
they're using your--

118
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:51,824
- Your face?
- No.

119
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,143
This is a--
this is the report.

120
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,943
This is the White House
website.

121
00:05:58,783 --> 00:06:00,142
That's you, right?

122
00:06:02,782 --> 00:06:06,062
Wow. You know you're fucking up
your peace process

123
00:06:06,222 --> 00:06:10,901
when you can't even get an actual
olive farmer to extend an olive branch.

124
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:14,580
But in the end--
in the end, that olive farmer

125
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,660
may have summed up
Jared's proposals

126
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,540
better than anyone else.

127
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,059
Kushner is very bad student.

128
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:24,739
He don't know nothing.

129
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:28,538
Exactly! He is right, because if you
didn't know it before this week,

130
00:06:28,698 --> 00:06:32,218
it's now clear that the only way
Jared's getting peace in the Middle East

131
00:06:32,378 --> 00:06:35,097
is if he somehow stumbles upon
a button in the woods

132
00:06:35,257 --> 00:06:37,217
labeled "Middle East
Peace Button."

133
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:39,657
And even then, there's only
around a 50/50 chance

134
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:42,017
that he knows enough
to fucking press it.

135
00:06:42,176 --> 00:06:43,856
And now this.

136
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:52,895
<i>The 20-pound live lobster</i>
<i>patted down by the TSA.</i>

137
00:06:53,055 --> 00:06:55,895
<i>Exclusive: it's his lobster.</i>

138
00:06:56,055 --> 00:06:58,334
<i>So why is he so upset?</i>
<i>And...</i>

139
00:06:58,494 --> 00:07:01,774
When you stuck your fingers
in that alligator's nose,

140
00:07:01,934 --> 00:07:03,254
what did the alligator do?

141
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:08,293
<i>Plus, the phone sucked</i>
<i>right out of an airplane.</i>

142
00:07:08,453 --> 00:07:10,372
<i>Then, don't hold the mayo.</i>

143
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:12,812
<i>Can you believe this guy?</i>
<i>Then...</i>

144
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:16,412
<i>It's Suzy the tiger, and...</i>

145
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:20,331
<i>back-to-school nose jobs</i>
<i>for twins.</i>

146
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:22,891
<i>Plus, the bear</i>
<i>that invited himself</i>

147
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:25,370
<i>to the family barbecue.</i>

148
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,730
<i>And...fear of nuclear war</i>
<i>got you down?</i>

149
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,050
<i>Buy a doomsday bunker.</i>
<i>Then...</i>

150
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,889
Why escalators can be so terrifying
for elderly people.

151
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:37,889
<i>And food buffet secrets.</i>
<i>Then...</i>

152
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:39,848
Cough syrup
murder investigation.

153
00:07:40,008 --> 00:07:42,568
<i>And real-life mole people</i>
<i>mystery.</i>

154
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,728
<i>Plus, killer umbrellas.</i>

155
00:07:44,888 --> 00:07:47,367
<i>And...funniest pitch ever?</i>

156
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:52,886
Moving on.

157
00:07:53,046 --> 00:07:56,846
For our main story tonight,
we're gonna talk about e-commerce.

158
00:07:57,006 --> 00:08:00,765
It's like regular commerce, but no one
calls the police when you do it naked.

159
00:08:00,925 --> 00:08:03,405
The rise of e-commerce
has dramatically changed

160
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:04,885
the way we shop
for everything,

161
00:08:05,045 --> 00:08:08,364
and its convenience is irresistible,
as this woman admits.

162
00:08:08,524 --> 00:08:10,444
If I don't have to get out
of the house,

163
00:08:10,604 --> 00:08:12,884
why not just
Amazon Prime it?

164
00:08:13,044 --> 00:08:14,883
I know she might sound lazy there,

165
00:08:15,043 --> 00:08:17,123
but you simply can't blame
Ashlyn Aardema.

166
00:08:17,283 --> 00:08:19,203
She's spent her life
at the beginning

167
00:08:19,363 --> 00:08:21,083
of every alphabetical list.

168
00:08:21,242 --> 00:08:23,162
She's never had to wait
for anything!

169
00:08:23,322 --> 00:08:26,682
N through Z, that's the sturdy boy's
half of the alphabet.

170
00:08:26,842 --> 00:08:30,441
That's where you learn the meaning of
the phrase "Hold on a second, John."

171
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:34,321
She's right. 20 years ago, when you
ran out of something like toilet paper,

172
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,880
you had to pull on your
Juicy Couture velour pants,

173
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,560
Uggs, and Von Dutch hat,
leave your house,

174
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,480
and go to something called
a "store,"

175
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,719
physically locate something
called an "aisle,"

176
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:46,439
pick the toilet paper up
with your physical arms,

177
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:50,398
drag yourself to the register using your
legs and feet, pay for it with cash,

178
00:08:50,558 --> 00:08:52,798
and then somehow transport
the toilet paper

179
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,398
all the way back to your house in a bag
even if you were thirsty!

180
00:08:56,558 --> 00:08:58,117
It was hell.

181
00:08:58,277 --> 00:09:01,797
Now, thankfully, you can just click
a button, which is much better.

182
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:03,517
It's no wonder
that e-commerce

183
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,396
is chipping away at
brick-and-mortar retail sales.

184
00:09:06,556 --> 00:09:09,796
And it can seem like the retail
jobs are shifting too.

185
00:09:09,956 --> 00:09:12,995
The number of workers who lost
their jobs at stores like Sears,

186
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:14,995
Macy's, and J.C. Penney
since 2000

187
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:18,074
is about the same
as the 444,000

188
00:09:18,234 --> 00:09:20,234
hired by
the warehousing industry.

189
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,874
It's as if warehouses
are absorbing

190
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:24,834
America's lost
retail employees,

191
00:09:24,993 --> 00:09:27,193
which initially sounds
kind of nice, doesn't it?

192
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:29,513
It's like hearing
there's a farm upstate

193
00:09:29,673 --> 00:09:32,872
where Borders, Circuit City,
and Tower Records employees

194
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:34,792
can run around and be free,

195
00:09:34,952 --> 00:09:37,192
when you always just assumed
that that was a lie,

196
00:09:37,352 --> 00:09:40,071
and that they were all
euthanized.

197
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:45,871
But what actually happens in warehouses
can be invisible to most people,

198
00:09:46,031 --> 00:09:49,390
unless companies like Amazon
choose to give us entertaining glimpses

199
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,630
into what a fun workplace
they run, like this.

200
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,509
<i>Have you ever wondered</i>
<i>how Amazon</i>

201
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:57,389
<i>gets your packages to you</i>
<i>so quickly?</i>

202
00:09:57,549 --> 00:09:58,909
<i>We do it with two things:</i>

203
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:02,068
<i>amazing technology</i>
<i>and amazing people.</i>

204
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:03,548
<i>Tell us about yourself, Sean.</i>

205
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,908
I receive products,
and I'm a horrible dancer.

206
00:10:06,068 --> 00:10:07,427
<i>Can we see some moves?</i>

207
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:11,867
<i>The SLAM machine weighs,</i>
<i>scans your box,</i>

208
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:14,546
<i>and attaches a label</i>
<i>all in, like, one second.</i>

209
00:10:14,706 --> 00:10:17,186
<i>Oh, and that's Ryan.</i>
<i>He loves photography.</i>

210
00:10:17,346 --> 00:10:18,746
I do love photography.

211
00:10:18,906 --> 00:10:21,865
<i>Finally, Jackie gives every single box</i>
<i>a long and loving hug</i>

212
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:23,625
<i>before loading it</i>
<i>onto a truck.</i>

213
00:10:23,785 --> 00:10:25,865
-No, I don't.
<i>-Maybe just this one?</i>

214
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,624
-Okay.
<i>-Aww, you love it.</i>

215
00:10:28,784 --> 00:10:30,464
Hold on. Hold on.

216
00:10:30,624 --> 00:10:34,064
Saying "You love it" after coercing her
into hugging a box

217
00:10:34,224 --> 00:10:35,664
is gross.

218
00:10:35,823 --> 00:10:38,023
It's telling that on YouTube-
and this is true-

219
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:41,143
comments are disabled
for that video.

220
00:10:41,303 --> 00:10:44,742
Presumably because Amazon knew
the only reasonable response to that is,

221
00:10:44,902 --> 00:10:47,342
"Fuck everything about this."

222
00:10:47,502 --> 00:10:50,861
The truth is, those jobs
are not all dance-offs and box hugging.

223
00:10:51,021 --> 00:10:53,861
They are physically hard,
as this commentator says,

224
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:56,341
albeit in the most tactless way
possible.

225
00:10:56,501 --> 00:10:58,860
But when you go to the
distribution centers--

226
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,580
they call them fulfillment centers,

227
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,060
'cause it's supposed to be fulfilling--
it's not.

228
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,419
It's an amazing thing to see,
but when I--

229
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,139
<i>my first time I visited one</i>
<i>of these massive warehouses</i>

230
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:12,018
<i>with row after row after row of stuff</i>
<i>and these people walking miles,</i>

231
00:11:12,178 --> 00:11:15,978
<i>tens of miles a day picking these things</i>
<i>and putting them back in there,</i>

232
00:11:16,138 --> 00:11:19,617
<i>it just looks like backbreaking,</i>
<i>exhausting work.</i>

233
00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:22,657
<i>-It made me thank God I went to college.</i>
<i>-That's right.</i>

234
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:26,616
Wow, joking about people
not going to college

235
00:11:26,776 --> 00:11:28,656
is some concentrated elitism.

236
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:30,896
Although, to be fair,
it is the condescension

237
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:33,255
that really pulls his outfit
together.

238
00:11:33,415 --> 00:11:36,615
A lilac plaid shirt
beneath a pastel plaid blazer--

239
00:11:36,775 --> 00:11:38,615
you look like
a Brooks Brothers mannequin

240
00:11:38,775 --> 00:11:41,494
who was thrown out
for being a noise violation.

241
00:11:41,654 --> 00:11:45,214
But the thing is, he is right:
it is backbreaking labor,

242
00:11:45,374 --> 00:11:46,693
sometimes literally.

243
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:49,333
The injury and illness rate
in the warehouse industry

244
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:51,853
is higher than industries
like coal mining,

245
00:11:52,013 --> 00:11:53,493
construction, and logging.

246
00:11:53,652 --> 00:11:56,292
I didn't know there were jobs
more dangerous than those,

247
00:11:56,452 --> 00:12:01,451
other than maybe rodeo clown,
Oompa Loompa, or shark dentist.

248
00:12:01,611 --> 00:12:03,811
And now is a good time
to talk about this,

249
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:06,531
because Amazon just announced
their annual Prime Day,

250
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:08,210
one of their biggest
sales events--

251
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,850
basically, Black Friday
in the middle of July.

252
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,570
So tonight, let's look

253
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,929
at the warehouse part
of the logistics industry

254
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:16,809
and the people
who work inside them.

255
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,129
Because the margins
are razor-thin,

256
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:21,849
and the tiniest details
can make a huge difference.

257
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:24,368
At Walmart's most recent
shareholder meeting,

258
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:26,608
their CEO brought
two workers onstage

259
00:12:26,768 --> 00:12:29,607
to show off how a minor change
they'd made to packing trucks

260
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:32,727
was going to pay off
in a big way for investors.

261
00:12:32,887 --> 00:12:37,486
We had this two-step stool
in the trailers, and guess what?

262
00:12:37,646 --> 00:12:39,126
It's kind of clunky.

263
00:12:39,286 --> 00:12:41,966
It's a little bit big,
and it's a little bit heavy.

264
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:44,005
So Francisco does this job
every day

265
00:12:44,165 --> 00:12:46,885
and figures out that
if we change to this stool,

266
00:12:47,045 --> 00:12:49,325
which is lighter
and easier to move around,

267
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:51,764
people will actually use it
all the time,

268
00:12:51,924 --> 00:12:54,564
and we're doing a better job
of cubing out the trailers.

269
00:12:54,724 --> 00:12:57,883
It's gonna save us
at least $30 million this year.

270
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,843
Can you thank these two for us?

271
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:03,163
Great job.
Great job.

272
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:05,202
Really appreciate it.

273
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:08,362
See ya.

274
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:11,761
Yeah! Give these guys
a warm Walmart thank-you!

275
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:15,361
Which is a small round of applause,
two hearty claps on the back,

276
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:19,480
and the request that they get this shit
off the stage and get back to work.

277
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,720
So there is a lot that goes on
behind the scenes at warehouses,

278
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,240
far from customers' eyes,

279
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,159
because many retail giants
subcontract

280
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:28,799
to lesser-known
outside companies.

281
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,439
Take this warehouse in Memphis.

282
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:34,198
It shipped phones for Verizon,
but it wasn't run by Verizon.

283
00:13:34,358 --> 00:13:36,678
It was owned and operated
by a company called XPO,

284
00:13:36,838 --> 00:13:38,758
one of the bigger names
in logistics.

285
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,557
And workers there said
conditions could be brutal.

286
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:44,677
Just last year, they complained
about extreme heat.

287
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:47,836
<i>The workers said in the complaint,</i>
<i>there's no air conditioning</i>

288
00:13:47,996 --> 00:13:50,836
<i>in most of the metal warehouse</i>
<i>on Citation Drive</i>

289
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:55,035
<i>and contended inside temperatures</i>
<i>can get dangerous on hot days.</i>

290
00:13:55,195 --> 00:13:56,795
<i>A TOSHA spokesperson said</i>

291
00:13:56,955 --> 00:13:58,955
<i>there's no requirement</i>
<i>for air conditioning</i>

292
00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:00,835
<i>in any Tennessee workplace.</i>

293
00:14:00,995 --> 00:14:03,434
An oven. Now I understand
how a chicken feels

294
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,114
when we put 'em in the oven.

295
00:14:05,274 --> 00:14:08,113
That sounds terrible.
Although I will say,

296
00:14:08,273 --> 00:14:11,793
a chicken shouldn't be feeling anything
when you put it in an oven.

297
00:14:11,953 --> 00:14:14,313
If it does, for the love of God,
check your recipe.

298
00:14:14,473 --> 00:14:16,832
You may have missed
some key steps.

299
00:14:16,992 --> 00:14:19,112
And heat is just the start
here.

300
00:14:19,272 --> 00:14:21,912
"The New York Times" reported
that a woman actually died

301
00:14:22,072 --> 00:14:23,911
of cardiac arrest
at the warehouse.

302
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,631
And a coworker told reporters
she'd witnessed her telling managers

303
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,590
that she was short of breath
and asking for an extra break,

304
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,390
which her supervisor denied.

305
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,150
Not just that--
other workers said

306
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,829
managers then told them
to keep moving boxes

307
00:14:36,989 --> 00:14:38,829
as her body lay on the floor.

308
00:14:38,989 --> 00:14:41,389
Now, legally, here is where
I have to tell you

309
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:43,708
that XPO takes issue
with "The Times's" story.

310
00:14:43,868 --> 00:14:45,468
They deny
that the worker who died

311
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:47,548
told her supervisor
she was feeling unwell,

312
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,828
and said
the company did allow workers

313
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:52,147
to leave for the day
after that worker died.

314
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:54,467
Although I simply don't know
how that squares

315
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,227
with this actual post
on Facebook from that day,

316
00:14:57,387 --> 00:14:58,906
where an XPO employee wrote,

317
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,826
"They're really trying
to make us work

318
00:15:00,986 --> 00:15:03,786
and this lady's dead body
still in the building."

319
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:07,945
XPO also insisted to us they conducted
a full, independent investigation

320
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:10,625
that showed just how wrong
"The Times's" story was.

321
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,104
So we said, "Great!
Can we see the report?"

322
00:15:13,264 --> 00:15:15,144
They said the investigation
had been run

323
00:15:15,304 --> 00:15:17,144
by someone who worked
for Michelle Obama.

324
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:20,463
And we said, "Great!
Can we see the report?"

325
00:15:20,623 --> 00:15:22,503
And they said no,
because, and I quote,

326
00:15:22,663 --> 00:15:24,223
"There is no written report,"

327
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:26,102
because it was given to them
verbally.

328
00:15:26,262 --> 00:15:28,822
So which account
should we believe here?

329
00:15:28,982 --> 00:15:31,022
XPO's spoken-word report,

330
00:15:31,182 --> 00:15:34,341
the details of which may disappear
into the wide chasm of history

331
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:37,461
in the grand tradition
of oral storytelling?

332
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:40,980
Or this written, contemporaneous account
from someone who was there,

333
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,980
about having to work around
a coworker's dead body?

334
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,820
It's up to you.
The lawyers say it's up to you.

335
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,819
I asked the lawyers, "Can it be
up to me?" And they said no.

336
00:15:49,979 --> 00:15:52,579
And I said, "If it was,
I'd choose the Facebook one."

337
00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:56,258
And they said, "You can't say that."
So I'm not going to.

338
00:15:56,418 --> 00:15:58,258
The point is,

339
00:15:58,418 --> 00:16:03,017
the warehouse industry operates
at a breakneck pace.

340
00:16:03,177 --> 00:16:05,417
At this point, we should
probably turn to Amazon,

341
00:16:05,577 --> 00:16:09,096
because they've increased competitive
pressure across the industry.

342
00:16:09,256 --> 00:16:12,456
As a former executive explains,
they set the bar high.

343
00:16:12,616 --> 00:16:15,256
There is a promise of speed,
which is completely sacred.

344
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,095
When you receive
an email from Amazon

345
00:16:17,255 --> 00:16:19,935
saying the item is on the way
and you'll get it tomorrow,

346
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:22,255
that promise has to be met,
at any cost.

347
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:26,094
Wow, "at any cost." It's a little weird
to hear someone

348
00:16:26,254 --> 00:16:29,254
treat my stupid Amazon
purchases with such urgency,

349
00:16:29,414 --> 00:16:31,613
'cause you're not delivering
diphtheria medicine

350
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:33,693
to a remote Alaskan village
here.

351
00:16:33,853 --> 00:16:36,053
You're delivering
novelty horse head masks

352
00:16:36,213 --> 00:16:39,812
to people who've forgotten they
ordered them till they showed up.

353
00:16:39,972 --> 00:16:42,612
Amazon is not the worst actor
in this industry.

354
00:16:42,772 --> 00:16:45,291
They generally don't subcontract
out their warehouses,

355
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:49,171
and made headlines last year for raising
workers' base pay to $15 an hour.

356
00:16:49,331 --> 00:16:53,410
But being "not the worst"
is a low, low bar,

357
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,730
and they have
huge influence here.

358
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,210
When Amazon announced
this year

359
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,529
that they'd be making one-day shipping
standard for Prime members,

360
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:03,209
Walmart immediately hinted
that it would do the same.

361
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:06,368
Basically, Amazon is
the industry trendsetter.

362
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:08,608
They're the Michael Jackson
of shipping:

363
00:17:08,768 --> 00:17:10,168
they're the best
at what they do,

364
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:11,728
everyone tries to imitate them,

365
00:17:11,888 --> 00:17:15,807
and nobody who learns a third thing
about them is happy that they did.

366
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:18,807
Because the conditions
in their warehouses

367
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:21,726
are not nearly as fun
as their ads like to suggest.

368
00:17:21,886 --> 00:17:23,566
They can be
physically draining,

369
00:17:23,726 --> 00:17:26,645
as this seasonal worker
in his 70s will tell you.

370
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:30,805
I had a scanner in my hand,
and the scanner would tell me

371
00:17:30,965 --> 00:17:36,284
to go pick up a box
of Oreo cookies

372
00:17:36,444 --> 00:17:38,804
<i>in the purple section.</i>

373
00:17:38,964 --> 00:17:40,923
<i>I would go there,</i>

374
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,283
<i>and then I'd get another scan,</i>

375
00:17:43,443 --> 00:17:47,922
<i>go pick up some STP oil</i>
<i>in the green section,</i>

376
00:17:48,082 --> 00:17:50,522
<i>which is the opposite side</i>
<i>of the warehouse,</i>

377
00:17:50,682 --> 00:17:52,882
<i>which the warehouse</i>
<i>is two football fields</i>

378
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:54,801
<i>or three football fields.</i>

379
00:17:54,961 --> 00:18:00,401
So I would end up, on a 10-hour shift,
walking 15 to 17 miles a day.

380
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:03,960
Yeah, and watching that
might stick in your head

381
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,560
the next time
you're sitting there

382
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,240
ordering next-day delivery
of Oreos.

383
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,359
Do you really need them that fast?
Probably not, right?

384
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,759
How about a 72-pack of Tide Pods?
Again, I'd argue no.

385
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:17,798
Or this costume that makes your cat
look like a sharpshooter?

386
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,678
Well, here it does get
more complicated, doesn't it?

387
00:18:20,838 --> 00:18:22,518
Your cat could be
a little cowboy.

388
00:18:22,678 --> 00:18:24,237
You could call him
"Butch Catsidy,"

389
00:18:24,397 --> 00:18:26,917
and you might want that
to happen as soon as possible.

390
00:18:27,077 --> 00:18:30,956
It's not an emergency, no,
but it's also not unimportant.

391
00:18:31,116 --> 00:18:33,036
And if you're thinking,
"That sounds tough,

392
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,436
but maybe that job
wasn't for that man,"

393
00:18:35,596 --> 00:18:38,955
you should know, the rate at which
Amazon has workers pick items

394
00:18:39,115 --> 00:18:41,715
can exhaust workers of any age.

395
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,435
<i>Pickers like Steven Abadelli</i>

396
00:18:43,595 --> 00:18:46,274
<i>walk 15 miles or more each day</i>

397
00:18:46,434 --> 00:18:49,794
<i>to retrieve as many</i>
<i>as 200 items an hour.</i>

398
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:52,273
<i>A handheld device</i>
<i>dictates every move</i>

399
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:55,513
<i>and counts down tasks</i>
<i>to the second.</i>

400
00:18:55,673 --> 00:18:58,552
It would say, I need to be
in aisle 54, get this item,

401
00:18:58,712 --> 00:19:01,632
and then suddenly,
"You're going to aisle 72,

402
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:04,352
and you have 10 seconds."

403
00:19:04,512 --> 00:19:06,151
<i>Abadelli struggled</i>
<i>to keep up,</i>

404
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,231
<i>and, like many,</i>
<i>was eventually let go.</i>

405
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:11,671
I would get out of work,
get home,

406
00:19:11,831 --> 00:19:14,910
and sit on the couch,
and my body would quit on me.

407
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,430
You're a guy
in your early 20s.

408
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,430
-Yeah.
-And you're still wiped out.

409
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,829
I was dead
at the end of the day.

410
00:19:21,989 --> 00:19:24,749
Look, no one should be
in their prime in the morning

411
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:26,469
and then dead
at the end of the day,

412
00:19:26,629 --> 00:19:28,508
unless they are a mayfly.

413
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,948
And mayflies are just not
spending their one day on Earth

414
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:33,748
in an Amazon warehouse.

415
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:36,787
Of course they're not.
They know the precious value of time.

416
00:19:36,947 --> 00:19:40,067
They're spending their day
doing a mountain of cocaine

417
00:19:40,227 --> 00:19:43,426
and fucking!

418
00:19:43,586 --> 00:19:45,146
#LIVEFASTDIEFAST.

419
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:47,306
#YOLO.

420
00:19:47,466 --> 00:19:48,785
But by many accounts,

421
00:19:48,945 --> 00:19:51,025
Amazon operates
at a relentless pace.

422
00:19:51,185 --> 00:19:54,345
As one YouTuber who's worked
in an Amazon warehouse will tell you,

423
00:19:54,505 --> 00:19:56,184
even when they offer
a rewards system,

424
00:19:56,344 --> 00:19:59,424
the incentives can be
a bit of a slap in the face.

425
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:00,904
They would be like,

426
00:20:01,064 --> 00:20:05,183
everyone's rates are really, really low,
so we'll have a power hour

427
00:20:05,343 --> 00:20:07,463
where you guys have to push
and push and push

428
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,382
as hard as you can,
and the winner gets a prize

429
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,902
for pushing and pushing
through the pain and all that.

430
00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:17,261
Guess what the damn prize was.

431
00:20:17,421 --> 00:20:19,981
A $10 gift card
to In-N-Out burger!

432
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:21,901
Yeah!

433
00:20:22,061 --> 00:20:23,980
I get why that was annoying.

434
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,540
You know what's better than
a $10 gift card to In-N-Out burger?

435
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,019
Just $10!
It's like an In-N-Out gift card,

436
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:34,739
but it can be used for things
that don't come "Animal Style."

437
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:37,818
Plus, over the years, Amazon has faced
criticism from workers

438
00:20:37,978 --> 00:20:40,938
over their willingness to
accommodate basic human needs,

439
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:42,578
like using the bathroom.

440
00:20:42,738 --> 00:20:45,777
Seven lawsuits have been filed
against them by pregnant workers,

441
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:48,137
who say they were refused
longer bathroom breaks

442
00:20:48,297 --> 00:20:50,137
and fewer continuous hours
on their feet.

443
00:20:50,297 --> 00:20:52,376
Now, legally, here is where
I have to tell you

444
00:20:52,536 --> 00:20:53,976
that Amazon says
it's accommodated

445
00:20:54,136 --> 00:20:55,616
thousands
of pregnant associates.

446
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:57,096
And more generally, they say,

447
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,055
"Associates are allowed to use
the toilet whenever needed."

448
00:21:00,215 --> 00:21:04,015
But that simply doesn't square
with many accounts from workers,

449
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:06,054
both in news reports and many,

450
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:09,134
many first-person testimonials
on YouTube.

451
00:21:09,294 --> 00:21:12,654
If you go to the bathroom during your
break, you have to wait in line,

452
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,133
and you won't make
your numbers for that period.

453
00:21:15,293 --> 00:21:16,813
Someone will come and talk to you.

454
00:21:16,973 --> 00:21:18,653
If you're far away
from the bathroom,

455
00:21:18,813 --> 00:21:21,772
it's gonna take you
a long time just to get there,

456
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:24,092
use it, and get back.

457
00:21:24,252 --> 00:21:26,652
Now your rate has plummeted.

458
00:21:26,812 --> 00:21:29,451
Unless you really, really,
really have to,

459
00:21:29,611 --> 00:21:32,771
just hold it until
you have your lunch break,

460
00:21:32,931 --> 00:21:34,770
because it will mess up
your rate,

461
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:38,170
and they will find any excuse
to fire you.

462
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,250
And that's just
not a good system

463
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,169
for multiple reasons,
including the fact

464
00:21:42,329 --> 00:21:44,409
that when people spend less
in the bathroom,

465
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,289
they don't shorten
the bathroom part.

466
00:21:46,449 --> 00:21:48,368
They shorten
the hand-washing part.

467
00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:50,568
So the next time
you order something online,

468
00:21:50,728 --> 00:21:54,608
it's probably safe to assume it's been
packed by urine-soaked hands.

469
00:21:54,768 --> 00:21:56,087
And if you're thinking,

470
00:21:56,247 --> 00:21:59,767
it can seem Amazon barely sees their
workers as human, you're not alone.

471
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:03,686
Just watch this interviewer have
that exact thought in real time.

472
00:22:03,846 --> 00:22:06,606
<i>The number of items</i>
<i>they pick per hour,</i>

473
00:22:06,766 --> 00:22:09,446
<i>the number of steps they take,</i>
<i>it's measured,</i>

474
00:22:09,605 --> 00:22:12,165
and when they're not as
productive as their colleagues,

475
00:22:12,325 --> 00:22:13,645
they're put on alert.

476
00:22:13,805 --> 00:22:17,804
There's a line of other people in these
communities waiting to take jobs.

477
00:22:17,964 --> 00:22:20,204
They're almost like robots,

478
00:22:20,364 --> 00:22:22,764
except they're obviously
human beings.

479
00:22:23,923 --> 00:22:27,843
Yeah, yeah.
I could honestly watch that guy

480
00:22:28,003 --> 00:22:31,762
figure out what things are almost like
for hours.

481
00:22:31,922 --> 00:22:34,962
Giraffes are almost
like horses,

482
00:22:35,122 --> 00:22:38,321
except they're obviously
stretchier.

483
00:22:38,481 --> 00:22:41,241
And Amazon--
Amazon is rolling out

484
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,561
more and more robots
in its warehouses,

485
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:46,120
increasingly working
side by side with humans,

486
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,960
a relationship
which isn't always seamless.

487
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,400
<i>An automated machine</i>
<i>like this one,</i>

488
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,919
<i>used by Amazon</i>
<i>to move merchandise,</i>

489
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:57,279
<i>accidentally punctured</i>
<i>a can of bear repellent.</i>

490
00:23:01,158 --> 00:23:04,398
<i>The toxic bear spray got</i>
<i>into the building's air vents.</i>

491
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:06,198
<i>More than 50 workers</i>
<i>complained</i>

492
00:23:06,357 --> 00:23:07,717
<i>about trouble breathing</i>

493
00:23:07,877 --> 00:23:10,837
<i>and a burning sensation</i>
<i>in their eyes and throats.</i>

494
00:23:10,997 --> 00:23:14,756
Yeah. The workers
were bear-maced by a robot.

495
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,436
Amazon says
they've now changed

496
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:19,436
how bear repellent is stored,
which is frankly just as well,

497
00:23:19,596 --> 00:23:22,915
because their workers have been
bear-maced more than once!

498
00:23:23,075 --> 00:23:25,235
In 2015,
a Texas fire department

499
00:23:25,395 --> 00:23:27,754
responded to an emergency
caused by a robot

500
00:23:27,914 --> 00:23:29,954
running over a can
of bear repellent.

501
00:23:30,114 --> 00:23:33,154
So in 50 years' time, when humanity
is caught in the crossfire

502
00:23:33,314 --> 00:23:35,753
of the great
bear versus robot war,

503
00:23:35,913 --> 00:23:38,073
remember,
robots fired the first shot,

504
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:40,793
and they fired twice.

505
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:43,752
And it's not just exhaustion

506
00:23:43,912 --> 00:23:46,112
or the potential
of being bear-maced.

507
00:23:46,272 --> 00:23:48,751
Reports have found numerous
cases of Amazon workers

508
00:23:48,911 --> 00:23:51,231
suffering from workplace
accidents or injuries,

509
00:23:51,391 --> 00:23:52,751
which isn't even surprising.

510
00:23:52,911 --> 00:23:55,631
Remember, this is
a physically demanding job.

511
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,470
And you might hope
that a labor union

512
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,550
could step in to push
for more protections,

513
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,630
but Amazon has actively
fought against that happening,

514
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,949
even producing a union-busting
training video for managers,

515
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:08,509
which leaked onto the internet
last fall.

516
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:12,428
We are not anti-union,
but we are not neutral either.

517
00:24:12,588 --> 00:24:15,468
We will boldly defend our direct
relationship with associates

518
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:19,227
as best for the associate,
the business, and our shareholders.

519
00:24:19,387 --> 00:24:21,587
We don't believe unions
are in the best interest

520
00:24:21,747 --> 00:24:23,387
of our customers,
our shareholders,

521
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:25,226
or most importantly,
our associates.

522
00:24:25,386 --> 00:24:27,746
Our business model
is built upon speed,

523
00:24:27,906 --> 00:24:29,946
innovation,
and customer obsession,

524
00:24:30,106 --> 00:24:33,225
things that are generally
not associated with unions.

525
00:24:33,385 --> 00:24:36,225
Yeah, "customer obsession"

526
00:24:36,385 --> 00:24:38,584
is not generally
associated with unions,

527
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:41,184
'cause it's
a very creepy phrase,

528
00:24:41,344 --> 00:24:44,064
and not one that I want to be associated
with any brand,

529
00:24:44,224 --> 00:24:45,743
much less one
that is so desperate

530
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:48,743
to put fucking microphones
inside my house!

531
00:24:48,903 --> 00:24:50,703
The more you look at Amazon,

532
00:24:50,863 --> 00:24:53,982
the more you realize that its
convenience comes with a real cost,

533
00:24:54,142 --> 00:24:58,422
because think about it: we used to have
to drive to stores to buy things.

534
00:24:58,582 --> 00:25:02,421
Now those things are brought directly
to us, and they're somehow cheaper.

535
00:25:02,581 --> 00:25:04,941
That didn't just happen
with a clever algorithm.

536
00:25:05,101 --> 00:25:06,780
It happened
by creating a system

537
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,940
that squeezes the people
lowest on the ladder, hard.

538
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,220
And all the while,
the man behind Amazon

539
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,139
is now worth $118 billion,

540
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:17,539
more than anyone else
in the world.

541
00:25:17,699 --> 00:25:19,979
He is so rich,
he seems to actually think

542
00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:22,218
that this is a reasonable
answer to a question

543
00:25:22,378 --> 00:25:25,098
about what he plans to do
with his personal wealth.

544
00:25:25,258 --> 00:25:27,338
The only way that I can see

545
00:25:27,498 --> 00:25:32,377
to deploy this much
financial resource

546
00:25:32,537 --> 00:25:36,016
is by converting
my Amazon winnings

547
00:25:36,176 --> 00:25:38,376
into space travel.

548
00:25:40,136 --> 00:25:41,736
Okay, so first:

549
00:25:41,896 --> 00:25:44,335
$118 billion
is not anybody's "winnings."

550
00:25:44,495 --> 00:25:46,575
It is a computer error
in capitalism.

551
00:25:46,735 --> 00:25:50,894
But it is true: Bezos is spending
a billion dollars a year

552
00:25:51,054 --> 00:25:54,414
on his personal space-exploration
company, Blue Origin.

553
00:25:54,574 --> 00:25:58,093
I'm not saying that billionaires playing
space games is a Freudian issue.

554
00:25:58,253 --> 00:26:00,893
Anyone can talk about how
rockets look like dicks.

555
00:26:01,053 --> 00:26:05,052
I will just say,
this is his actual rocket,

556
00:26:05,212 --> 00:26:07,092
which looks even more
like a dick

557
00:26:07,252 --> 00:26:08,732
than you expected it to.

558
00:26:08,892 --> 00:26:11,451
It has a head!

559
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:15,211
And even at
a billion dollars a year,

560
00:26:15,371 --> 00:26:17,730
that's just a drop
in the bucket of a fortune

561
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:20,210
that Bezos can't seem
to figure out how to spend.

562
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,490
Meanwhile,
some of his employees

563
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,969
seem to be working themselves
to exhaustion.

564
00:26:25,129 --> 00:26:27,529
Amazon has driven
the whole warehouse industry

565
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:30,009
to move constantly faster
and faster

566
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:31,728
on already low margins.

567
00:26:31,888 --> 00:26:35,168
And, sure, the fact that it pays
at least $15 an hour is nice.

568
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:37,528
But raising workers' wages

569
00:26:37,688 --> 00:26:39,687
is only part of the equation
here.

570
00:26:39,847 --> 00:26:41,527
Making sure these jobs
are safe

571
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:44,007
and that the pace is
sustainable is critical too.

572
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:45,766
And if Bezos has enough money

573
00:26:45,926 --> 00:26:48,846
to fund his space dicks
in perpetuity,

574
00:26:49,006 --> 00:26:50,726
it isn't a question
of whether he "can"

575
00:26:50,886 --> 00:26:52,925
improve working conditions
for his employees.

576
00:26:53,085 --> 00:26:55,165
It's just a question
of if he wants to.

577
00:26:55,325 --> 00:26:57,805
And if he doesn't want to,
at the very least,

578
00:26:57,965 --> 00:27:00,164
Amazon should present
a more realistic picture

579
00:27:00,324 --> 00:27:02,124
of what their promises
cost the workers

580
00:27:02,284 --> 00:27:03,844
who make it all happen.

581
00:27:04,004 --> 00:27:05,724
<i>Have you ever wondered</i>
<i>how Amazon</i>

582
00:27:05,884 --> 00:27:07,643
<i>gets your packages to you</i>
<i>so quickly?</i>

583
00:27:07,803 --> 00:27:09,283
<i>We do it with two things:</i>

584
00:27:09,443 --> 00:27:11,643
<i>amazing technology</i>
<i>and amazing people.</i>

585
00:27:11,803 --> 00:27:14,842
<i>Every day, thousands of items arrive</i>
<i>and Sean goes to find them.</i>

586
00:27:15,002 --> 00:27:16,322
<i>Tell us about yourself, Sean.</i>

587
00:27:16,482 --> 00:27:18,882
I pick up products,
and I'm a horrible dancer.

588
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:20,802
<i>That's fun.</i>
<i>Can we see some moves?</i>

589
00:27:20,962 --> 00:27:23,361
Oh, I've already walked
12 miles today.

590
00:27:23,521 --> 00:27:24,841
<i>I said dance!</i>

591
00:27:26,721 --> 00:27:28,201
Ah, fuck! Shit!

592
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,760
<i>Sick moves!</i>

593
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,880
<i>That's Ryan. He moves items</i>
<i>around the fulfillment center.</i>

594
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,800
I don't have time to go
to the bathroom,

595
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,399
so I'll stand here
and wet myself.

596
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,319
<i>-Good for you, Ryan.</i>
-All right.

597
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:41,479
-Can't do it while you watch.
<i>-Okay.</i>

598
00:27:41,639 --> 00:27:43,678
-Okay.
<i>-All right.</i>

599
00:27:43,838 --> 00:27:46,438
All right. Seriously.

600
00:27:46,638 --> 00:27:49,278
<i>Lisa here packs your stuff</i>
<i>into boxes, don't you, Lisa?</i>

601
00:27:49,438 --> 00:27:51,877
Can't talk, I'm running behind
on my units per hour.

602
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:54,797
<i>It's okay. Just tell us a little bit</i>
<i>about yourself, Lis.</i>

603
00:27:54,957 --> 00:27:59,236
I'm a mom. Got two kids. I don't see
them as much as I like, but--

604
00:27:59,396 --> 00:28:03,436
<i>Nobody cares about your kids, Lisa.</i>
<i>You're falling behind! Faster!</i>

605
00:28:03,596 --> 00:28:05,435
-Oh, fuck you.
<i>-No, fuck you!</i>

606
00:28:05,595 --> 00:28:07,675
<i>The SLAM machine weighs,</i>
<i>scans your box,</i>

607
00:28:07,835 --> 00:28:10,275
<i>and attaches a label</i>
<i>all in, like, one second.</i>

608
00:28:10,435 --> 00:28:13,074
<i>-And this is Alberto.</i>
-My friends call me Al.

609
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:15,674
And I got to say, I think a union
would help address

610
00:28:15,834 --> 00:28:17,234
some of the systemic problems--

611
00:28:17,394 --> 00:28:19,153
<i>-Oh! Bear spray!</i>
-Jesus Christ!

612
00:28:19,313 --> 00:28:21,753
<i>And finally,</i>
<i>Jackie hugs every box.</i>

613
00:28:21,913 --> 00:28:23,233
-No, I don't.
<i>-Aww.</i>

614
00:28:23,393 --> 00:28:25,072
<i>-Maybe just this one?</i>
-Okay.

615
00:28:25,232 --> 00:28:27,992
<i>-Because a lot of people want this job.</i>
-Okay.

616
00:28:28,152 --> 00:28:30,112
<i>One day,</i>
<i>a robot will hug boxes,</i>

617
00:28:30,272 --> 00:28:31,832
<i>and we'll be done</i>
<i>with this charade.</i>

618
00:28:31,991 --> 00:28:35,831
-Yeah, I get it.
<i>-But until then, hug the box, Jackie.</i>

619
00:28:35,991 --> 00:28:39,870
-Okay...
<i>-Good. Now kiss it.</i>

620
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,390
-I don't want to.
<i>-I said, kiss the box.</i>

621
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,750
<i>Every day, hundreds</i>
<i>of thousands of packages</i>

622
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,269
<i>are shipped</i>
<i>to your front door,</i>

623
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:48,709
<i>and that's all because</i>
<i>of our amazing associates.</i>

624
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:51,509
<i>-Happy Prime Day, everyone.</i>
-Happy Prime Day.

625
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:53,149
<i>Bear spray!</i>

626
00:28:55,468 --> 00:28:56,828
Hey, what's up, Sean?

627
00:28:56,988 --> 00:28:58,868
<i>Amazon.</i>
<i>Try not to think about it.</i>

628
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:01,507
That's our show.
Thanks for watching!

629
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:05,107
We're off next week,
back July 28th. Good night!
