1
00:00:30,478 --> 00:00:31,647
Welcome, welcome,

2
00:00:31,713 --> 00:00:32,682
welcome to "last week tonight."

3
00:00:32,748 --> 00:00:34,185
I'm John Oliver, thank you so

4
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:38,092
much for joining us.

5
00:00:38,158 --> 00:00:40,963
We are back, we're back.

6
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,735
There is no time,

7
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:44,303
there's no time to get into

8
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:45,639
everything we missed over the

9
00:00:45,706 --> 00:00:46,240
last three months, suffice to

10
00:00:46,307 --> 00:00:47,342
say, every single person in

11
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:48,076
America is now running for

12
00:00:48,143 --> 00:00:49,713
president, Jeff bezos told us

13
00:00:49,779 --> 00:00:51,116
all to keep an eye out for his

14
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:51,684
dick pic, and of course, the

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,526
president has been very busy.

16
00:00:56,593 --> 00:00:57,761
He famously posed with a feast

17
00:00:57,827 --> 00:00:58,730
of 300 hamburgers -- or as he

18
00:00:58,796 --> 00:01:00,700
put it, "over 1,000 hamberders."

19
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:01,869
And on Christmas Eve, he spoke

20
00:01:01,935 --> 00:01:03,404
to a seven-year-old and said

21
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:04,940
this.

22
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:08,414
Are you still a believer in

23
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:09,683
Santa?

24
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,918
'Cause at seven, it's marginal,

25
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:12,087
right?

26
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:14,158
Yeah, that's the

27
00:01:14,224 --> 00:01:15,528
President of the United States

28
00:01:15,594 --> 00:01:17,330
ruining Santa for a child on

29
00:01:17,397 --> 00:01:19,468
December 24th, which is actually

30
00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:25,111
perfectly on-brand.

31
00:01:25,178 --> 00:01:26,581
Because if there's one thing

32
00:01:26,648 --> 00:01:27,916
trump is good at, it's fucking

33
00:01:27,982 --> 00:01:29,018
up children forever.

34
00:01:29,084 --> 00:01:30,187
But the major drama since we

35
00:01:30,254 --> 00:01:30,955
left has been president trump's

36
00:01:31,022 --> 00:01:31,990
repeated attempts to get

37
00:01:32,057 --> 00:01:32,959
congress to fund his border

38
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:33,960
wall, including shutting the

39
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,263
government down for nearly a

40
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,232
month, and this Friday, he tried

41
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,703
a new approach.

42
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:39,838
Underway right now,

43
00:01:39,904 --> 00:01:41,274
president trump declares a

44
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:42,376
national emergency in an attempt

45
00:01:42,443 --> 00:01:43,412
to get billions for a border

46
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,880
wall.

47
00:01:44,947 --> 00:01:46,083
Yes, according to

48
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,252
trump, the border suddenly

49
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,621
constitutes a national

50
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:50,357
emergency, or as he might spell

51
00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:51,326
it in a tweet, "the berder

52
00:01:51,392 --> 00:01:52,328
cornstidutes a nertional

53
00:01:52,394 --> 00:01:54,833
ederdency."

54
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,101
And to be clear, there is zero

55
00:01:56,168 --> 00:01:57,036
actual emergency at the border

56
00:01:57,103 --> 00:01:58,172
right now.

57
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,341
Illegal crossings have been

58
00:01:59,374 --> 00:02:01,010
declining for 20 years.

59
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:01,812
And as we've talked about before

60
00:02:01,912 --> 00:02:02,814
on this show, a wall would be

61
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,481
expensive and completely

62
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:05,585
ineffective.

63
00:02:05,652 --> 00:02:06,454
But putting those aside,

64
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,789
declaring a national emergency

65
00:02:07,856 --> 00:02:10,026
is a big step.

66
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:11,196
Emergency declarations are meant

67
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:12,531
to temporarily enhance the

68
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:13,767
president's power during a

69
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,003
legitimate crisis, so trump

70
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,472
needed to sell this as a real

71
00:02:16,538 --> 00:02:18,208
emergency.

72
00:02:18,276 --> 00:02:19,711
And yet, within minutes of

73
00:02:19,778 --> 00:02:22,149
declaring it, he said this.

74
00:02:22,216 --> 00:02:23,385
I could do the wall over a

75
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:24,553
longer period of time.

76
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,123
I didn't need to do this.

77
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:27,626
But I'd rather do it much

78
00:02:27,693 --> 00:02:29,162
faster.

79
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:30,196
Well, it's not an

80
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:31,901
emergency then, is it?

81
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:34,003
Also, for the record, there is

82
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,875
no way that's the first time

83
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:37,076
this week trump has claimed, "i

84
00:02:37,143 --> 00:02:38,211
could do this over a longer

85
00:02:38,278 --> 00:02:39,715
period of time, I'd just rather

86
00:02:39,782 --> 00:02:41,786
do it much faster."

87
00:02:41,852 --> 00:02:43,287
Happy Valentine's day, you two.

88
00:02:43,355 --> 00:02:45,992
#couplegoals.

89
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:47,228
And as if that weren't bad

90
00:02:47,295 --> 00:02:48,698
enough, he then responded to

91
00:02:48,764 --> 00:02:49,866
this newly declared emergency

92
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:51,402
by, just hours later, flying off

93
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:53,105
to Florida for the weekend,

94
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,608
where he's apparently been

95
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,811
photographed waiting at an

96
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:57,113
omelet bar.

97
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,449
You know, the kind of thing you

98
00:02:58,515 --> 00:03:01,120
do when America is in crisis.

99
00:03:01,187 --> 00:03:02,523
Now, unsurprisingly, there were

100
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,592
legal challenges filed almost

101
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:04,894
instantly, which shocked nobody,

102
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:08,200
including trump himself.

103
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:09,570
And we will have a national

104
00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:10,939
emergency, and we will then be

105
00:03:11,005 --> 00:03:12,775
sued and they will sue us in the

106
00:03:12,843 --> 00:03:14,411
ninth circuit -- even though it

107
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,047
shouldn't be there -- and we

108
00:03:16,115 --> 00:03:18,285
will possibly get a bad ruling,

109
00:03:18,352 --> 00:03:20,523
and then we'll get another bad

110
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,593
ruling, and then we'll end up in

111
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,463
the supreme court, and hopefully

112
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,866
we'll get a fair shake, and

113
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:31,242
we'll win in the supreme court.

114
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:32,678
You know, yet another

115
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:33,513
great reason for trump to not be

116
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,883
president is that now I kind of

117
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:35,985
want to see him as a historical

118
00:03:36,051 --> 00:03:36,987
expert on the next Ken burns

119
00:03:37,053 --> 00:03:38,255
miniseries.

120
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:39,691
"They killed the archduke and

121
00:03:39,758 --> 00:03:41,227
Germany got mad, and then there

122
00:03:41,294 --> 00:03:43,598
were tanks and also poison gas,

123
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:45,068
and there was a beagle on a

124
00:03:45,134 --> 00:03:46,570
doghouse flying around shooting

125
00:03:46,637 --> 00:03:48,273
at people, and then America

126
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,645
won."

127
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:51,847
Look, there will be plenty more

128
00:03:51,914 --> 00:03:53,148
to say about trump's border wall

129
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,452
going forward, but for now, I'd

130
00:03:54,518 --> 00:03:55,854
voted

131
00:03:55,922 --> 00:03:56,889
number one in the world by

132
00:03:56,956 --> 00:03:58,125
"places to end your marriage"

133
00:03:58,192 --> 00:03:59,862
magazine.

134
00:03:59,929 --> 00:04:01,565
Last week, Ikea apologized after

135
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:07,308
making an embarrassing mistake.

136
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,443
Ikea is facing criticism

137
00:04:08,511 --> 00:04:09,479
after selling a map that had a

138
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:10,547
little something missing.

139
00:04:10,614 --> 00:04:11,817
Customers in Washington, D.C.,

140
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,252
noticed the $30 map of the world

141
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,889
forgot to show New Zealand.

142
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:16,659
It's bad timing for Ikea because

143
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:18,596
the company is in the process of

144
00:04:18,662 --> 00:04:20,733
opening its first store there.

145
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,037
Oops.

146
00:04:23,104 --> 00:04:25,174
Yeah, "oops," indeed.

147
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:26,911
I'm not sure which one is more

148
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:28,013
surprising there, that Ikea

149
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,282
forgot New Zealand or that Ikea

150
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:31,686
sells world maps for $30.

151
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:33,090
Bear in mind, you can buy an

152
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:34,726
entire dining room table at Ikea

153
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:37,263
for $39.

154
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:38,900
So by that pricing, a world map

155
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:42,406
should cost negative $40.

156
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:43,575
Now, incredibly, this is not

157
00:04:43,675 --> 00:04:44,710
even the first time this has

158
00:04:44,777 --> 00:04:46,446
happened to New Zealand.

159
00:04:46,513 --> 00:04:47,215
Their prime minister openly

160
00:04:47,282 --> 00:04:49,619
complained about it last year.

161
00:04:49,686 --> 00:04:50,721
We're not actually on every

162
00:04:50,788 --> 00:04:52,057
map that's out there, so...

163
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,359
Seriously?

164
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,094
No, it's actually a real

165
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:55,063
problem.

166
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,499
We've had a campaign around it.

167
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:57,500
Yup, there are maps where we are

168
00:04:57,567 --> 00:04:58,302
missing.

169
00:04:58,368 --> 00:04:59,470
No!

170
00:04:59,537 --> 00:05:01,074
Yes.

171
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:02,209
It's honestly true.

172
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:03,244
New Zealand gets left off maps

173
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:04,546
all the time.

174
00:05:04,613 --> 00:05:05,615
Now, do I think that that is

175
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:06,317
funny?

176
00:05:06,383 --> 00:05:07,552
Yes.

177
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:08,020
Yes, I do.

178
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:08,955
Yes.

179
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:10,057
New Zealand, a place that's

180
00:05:10,124 --> 00:05:11,192
basically Times Square if all

181
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:12,361
the people were sheep and if all

182
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:14,364
the neon signs were also sheep,

183
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:16,268
keeps getting picked never in

184
00:05:16,335 --> 00:05:18,772
the dodgeball game of maps.

185
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,375
That is objectively funny to me.

186
00:05:20,442 --> 00:05:22,412
But this is a surprisingly

187
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,281
common occurrence.

188
00:05:23,348 --> 00:05:24,282
There's both a subreddit and a

189
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,485
tumblr dedicated to collecting

190
00:05:25,552 --> 00:05:26,587
examples of maps without

191
00:05:26,654 --> 00:05:28,257
New Zealand on them.

192
00:05:28,323 --> 00:05:29,726
For example, it's apparently

193
00:05:29,793 --> 00:05:30,794
been left out from this textbook

194
00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:32,031
illustration, this box from

195
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,166
Tiffany's, and the board game

196
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,869
"risk," as well as on large maps

197
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:36,138
in multiple major airports,

198
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:37,607
including Munich, Beijing, and

199
00:05:37,674 --> 00:05:40,213
Prague, which begs the question:

200
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:42,282
Where do these airports think

201
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:43,885
flights to New Zealand are

202
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:46,224
going?

203
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,325
"We are now boarding the 8:55 to

204
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:48,560
Auckland.

205
00:05:48,627 --> 00:05:49,462
Not sure where or what that is,

206
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:50,631
so from everyone here at

207
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:51,700
delta airlines, we wish you a

208
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:54,138
Sincere good luck."

209
00:05:54,204 --> 00:05:55,640
And look, whether you like

210
00:05:55,707 --> 00:05:56,842
New Zealand or not, you can't

211
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:58,545
deny it is there.

212
00:05:58,612 --> 00:06:00,182
It's not just Australia's

213
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:02,620
imaginary friend.

214
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:03,855
And they are trying their best.

215
00:06:03,922 --> 00:06:05,292
They did have an official

216
00:06:05,358 --> 00:06:07,028
campaign just last year using

217
00:06:07,095 --> 00:06:08,564
the hashtag

218
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:10,067
#getnewzealandonthemap,

219
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:12,972
but it clearly didn't work.

220
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,308
So tonight we're going to try to

221
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,409
help them out by giving people a

222
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:16,478
practical way to put things

223
00:06:16,545 --> 00:06:17,881
right here.

224
00:06:17,948 --> 00:06:19,117
So if you go to our Twitter feed

225
00:06:19,184 --> 00:06:20,452
right now, you'll find a map of

226
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,422
New Zealand you can print out

227
00:06:22,489 --> 00:06:23,926
and add to any incorrect map of

228
00:06:23,992 --> 00:06:25,829
your choosing.

229
00:06:25,895 --> 00:06:27,531
If you own that Ikea map?

230
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:29,937
Add New Zealand right there.

231
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:31,306
If you have the board game

232
00:06:31,372 --> 00:06:32,875
"risk," add New Zealand.

233
00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:34,411
And then throw it away because

234
00:06:34,511 --> 00:06:36,615
it's a terrible game.

235
00:06:36,682 --> 00:06:37,851
And also why stop with

236
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:38,686
inaccurate maps?

237
00:06:38,753 --> 00:06:39,453
You can put New Zealand on

238
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,323
everything.

239
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:42,126
Map of Florida?

240
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:42,961
Add New Zealand.

241
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:43,828
An anatomical map of male sexual

242
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:45,531
organs?

243
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:47,101
Add New Zealand.

244
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:48,804
In fact, add two.

245
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:50,708
And, finally, if you should ever

246
00:06:50,775 --> 00:06:52,378
find yourself in an Ikea, you

247
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:54,248
can help them never forget my

248
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,683
favorite heavily-logged island

249
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:01,161
nation ever again by finding

250
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:02,530
their in-store store map and

251
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:03,365
going full New Zealand on it.

252
00:07:03,431 --> 00:07:04,233
It's the only way they'll learn.

253
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,371
And now, this.

254
00:07:06,437 --> 00:07:07,839
And now,

255
00:07:07,906 --> 00:07:08,908
news anchors shit talk the

256
00:07:08,974 --> 00:07:10,143
winner of the westminster

257
00:07:10,211 --> 00:07:12,181
dog show.

258
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:13,183
This is not my favorite breed

259
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:14,484
of dog.

260
00:07:14,552 --> 00:07:15,420
I just don't find it very

261
00:07:15,486 --> 00:07:16,621
attractive.

262
00:07:16,688 --> 00:07:17,557
It's not my favorite-looking

263
00:07:17,623 --> 00:07:18,759
dog.

264
00:07:18,826 --> 00:07:22,233
It's ridiculous.

265
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:22,967
So goofy, that face.

266
00:07:23,034 --> 00:07:23,568
He looks snobby.

267
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:24,536
That dog looks like in the

268
00:07:24,603 --> 00:07:25,572
morning he wakes up and sips tea

269
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:26,807
and eats crumpets.

270
00:07:26,874 --> 00:07:30,647
He should get a shave.

271
00:07:30,714 --> 00:07:31,216
That beard.

272
00:07:31,282 --> 00:07:31,916
Puffy legs, puffy chin.

273
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:32,918
Goofy-looking dog.

274
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,357
Does that dog have knees?

275
00:07:35,424 --> 00:07:39,264
He needs a shave.

276
00:07:39,331 --> 00:07:43,271
No, it's okay.

277
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:47,044
Arthur Chester look, or

278
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:54,291
Chester a. Arthur.

279
00:07:54,358 --> 00:07:54,825
I gave you the phone book

280
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:55,126
version.

281
00:07:55,193 --> 00:07:55,760
Either way, I don't know.

282
00:07:55,827 --> 00:07:56,495
Chester Arthur.

283
00:07:56,562 --> 00:07:57,163
You don't know?

284
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:57,831
He was president?

285
00:07:57,898 --> 00:07:58,499
He was not president.

286
00:07:58,565 --> 00:07:59,200
Chester Arthur?

287
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:00,035
You sure about that?

288
00:08:00,102 --> 00:08:00,569
100% sure.

289
00:08:00,636 --> 00:08:01,237
Who am I thinking of?

290
00:08:01,304 --> 00:08:01,938
I don't know.

291
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:02,606
Taft?

292
00:08:02,673 --> 00:08:04,944
I have no idea.

293
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:05,545
Woodrow Wilson?

294
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:06,246
No, it was before that.

295
00:08:06,313 --> 00:08:06,948
I think it was Chester a.

296
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:07,582
Arthur.

297
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:10,720
There was no president named

298
00:08:10,788 --> 00:08:11,656
Chester a. -- Jesse, look it up.

299
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:18,702
Moving on.

300
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:20,072
Our main story tonight concerns

301
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:21,708
an issue that promises to

302
00:08:21,808 --> 00:08:23,811
dominate this entire year,

303
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,048
brexit, the playful, fun name

304
00:08:25,114 --> 00:08:26,784
that's been given to a disaster.

305
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,321
It's like if you said

306
00:08:28,387 --> 00:08:29,890
an animal died of

307
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:31,693
"otter-erotic asphyxiation."

308
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,232
It's cute, although when you

309
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,274
think about the actual

310
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:39,975
consequences, it becomes quite

311
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:40,709
sad.

312
00:08:40,776 --> 00:08:41,378
It's now been two and a half

313
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:42,012
years since britain voted to

314
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:42,746
leave the eu.

315
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:43,582
The long story short is, there

316
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,483
was a bus with a lie on it,

317
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,587
people made a massively

318
00:08:46,653 --> 00:08:47,422
consequential decision by a

319
00:08:47,489 --> 00:08:48,190
narrow margin, and ever since,

320
00:08:48,256 --> 00:08:48,958
the subject of the impending

321
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:49,926
brexit has dominated every

322
00:08:49,993 --> 00:08:51,229
waking moment in British life.

323
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:52,664
It even comes up on reality

324
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:53,867
shows like this one, called

325
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,604
"love island."

326
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,072
What do you think about

327
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,974
brexit?

328
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:58,976
What's that?

329
00:08:59,043 --> 00:09:00,278
Where we're leaving the

330
00:09:00,345 --> 00:09:02,116
European union.

331
00:09:02,182 --> 00:09:02,883
I seriously don't have a

332
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,320
clue.

333
00:09:04,387 --> 00:09:06,156
So it was to leave the eu so

334
00:09:06,223 --> 00:09:06,757
we wouldn't be part of Europe.

335
00:09:06,823 --> 00:09:08,327
Oh, the eu, yeah, yeah.

336
00:09:08,394 --> 00:09:09,061
Which would mean, like,

337
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:11,032
welfare, and, like, things we

338
00:09:11,098 --> 00:09:12,067
trade with would be cut down.

339
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,405
So does that mean we won't

340
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,607
have any trees?

341
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,909
Cheese?

342
00:09:16,976 --> 00:09:19,681
Trees.

343
00:09:19,747 --> 00:09:21,083
No, that's got nothing to do

344
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,918
with it, babe, that's weather.

345
00:09:21,985 --> 00:09:23,120
Why wouldn't we have trees?

346
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,725
But doesn't it mean it would

347
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:26,360
be harder to go to, like, Spain

348
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:27,094
and stuff?

349
00:09:27,162 --> 00:09:27,962
So it would be harder to go

350
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:28,764
on holidays?

351
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
Yeah, I think so.

352
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:30,568
Oh, I love my holidays!

353
00:09:30,635 --> 00:09:32,639
Yeah.

354
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,375
Okay, so there's a lot

355
00:09:34,442 --> 00:09:35,410
to unpack there, absolutely none

356
00:09:35,477 --> 00:09:40,752
of which is worth unpacking.

357
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,588
It's like coming over to help a

358
00:09:41,655 --> 00:09:42,490
friend move and finding all his

359
00:09:42,557 --> 00:09:43,525
boxes are labeled "dead spiders

360
00:09:43,592 --> 00:09:45,027
for mommy."

361
00:09:45,094 --> 00:09:46,297
Yeah, you could unpack that, but

362
00:09:46,363 --> 00:09:47,231
it's probably better to just

363
00:09:47,298 --> 00:09:48,200
burn everything to the ground

364
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:49,570
and never speak of it again.

365
00:09:49,636 --> 00:09:51,539
The point is, you cannot escape

366
00:09:51,606 --> 00:09:53,309
talk about brexit in the uk.

367
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:54,845
It's something brilliantly

368
00:09:54,911 --> 00:09:56,415
captured by a TV show called

369
00:09:56,482 --> 00:09:57,550
"gogglebox."

370
00:09:57,617 --> 00:09:58,786
It's a show in britain where you

371
00:09:58,853 --> 00:09:59,421
get to watch other people watch

372
00:09:59,488 --> 00:10:00,623
TV.

373
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,092
It's actually great, trust me.

374
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:02,893
Just eavesdrop on some British

375
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,366
people watching the news.

376
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:07,935
Why did David Cameron call a

377
00:10:08,002 --> 00:10:11,842
referendum in the first place?

378
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,412
He should be put in prison.

379
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,013
Britain wants to have their

380
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:14,815
cake and eat it.

381
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:16,151
They want to trade with the rest

382
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:17,354
of the world, but they also have

383
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,155
the benefit of trading with

384
00:10:18,221 --> 00:10:20,392
Europe.

385
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:21,762
I'm halfway through the

386
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:24,634
585-page withdrawal agreement.

387
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,002
No!

388
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:28,072
Who are you?

389
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:29,776
It's like one of those mugs I

390
00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:32,447
saw in pudsey, Mary.

391
00:10:32,514 --> 00:10:34,852
"Different day, same old shit."

392
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,522
Mary.

393
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:37,724
I don't like you swearing.

394
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,026
I saw it on a mug.

395
00:10:39,092 --> 00:10:39,928
I'm just quoting what I read on

396
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:40,663
a mug.

397
00:10:40,729 --> 00:10:41,965
Okay.

398
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:43,100
"Here's something else

399
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:44,403
I saw on a mug, Mary.

400
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:45,872
'This marriage is like

401
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:46,974
a locomotive lying on my chest,

402
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,143
crushing my spirit to dust.'

403
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,345
I'm just quoting what I saw on a

404
00:10:49,412 --> 00:10:50,080
mug, Mary.

405
00:10:50,147 --> 00:10:53,587
Don't blame me, blame the mug."

406
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,791
People in britain are exhausted

407
00:10:55,857 --> 00:10:57,125
by brexit talk, and the crazy

408
00:10:57,193 --> 00:10:58,729
thing is, it hasn't even

409
00:10:58,797 --> 00:11:00,198
happened yet, although it has

410
00:11:00,265 --> 00:11:01,602
already had big effects on the

411
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:05,976
British economy.

412
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:07,546
In the wake of the brexit vote,

413
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:08,513
the uk has become one of the

414
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,717
worst-performing economies in

415
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:10,885
the g-7, major companies like

416
00:11:10,951 --> 00:11:11,453
Nissan and Dyson are moving

417
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,320
operations out of britain, and

418
00:11:12,387 --> 00:11:13,690
the pound has dropped by almost

419
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,293
14%.

420
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,295
And all of this will come to a

421
00:11:16,362 --> 00:11:17,697
head just 40 days from now, on

422
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:18,965
march 29, when the uk is set to

423
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:22,573
officially leave the eu.

424
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,543
And it could be an absolute

425
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,746
catastrophe because nothing is

426
00:11:25,812 --> 00:11:26,881
happening the way that was

427
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:28,384
promised.

428
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,287
Britain was supposed to leave

429
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:31,857
the eu in orderly stages, first

430
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:34,093
entering a transition period on

431
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,530
march 29, during which it would

432
00:11:35,597 --> 00:11:36,932
negotiate its future

433
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:38,302
relationship with the eu and

434
00:11:38,368 --> 00:11:41,240
then leave entirely.

435
00:11:41,307 --> 00:11:42,877
And prime minister Theresa may

436
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:44,112
has spent the last two years

437
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:45,615
locking down the terms of that

438
00:11:45,682 --> 00:11:47,151
transition plan with the eu.

439
00:11:47,217 --> 00:11:48,219
But when she presented this

440
00:11:48,286 --> 00:11:49,355
agreed-upon deal to parliament,

441
00:11:49,422 --> 00:11:51,259
this happened.

442
00:11:51,326 --> 00:11:52,962
Theresa may suffers the

443
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:54,264
biggest commons defeat in

444
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:55,701
history.

445
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:56,803
This was the moment the

446
00:11:56,869 --> 00:12:00,108
defeat was announced.

447
00:12:00,175 --> 00:12:03,414
The ayes to the right, 202.

448
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:05,184
The nos to the left, 432.

449
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:10,159
What was that noise?

450
00:12:10,226 --> 00:12:11,663
That was the biggest commons

451
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,965
defeat in British history and

452
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,066
they sounded like a

453
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:14,969
middle school lunchroom who just

454
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:15,738
heard someone called to the

455
00:12:15,804 --> 00:12:21,481
principal's office.

456
00:12:21,547 --> 00:12:22,816
"Oh, Theresa's in trou-ble!"

457
00:12:22,884 --> 00:12:24,754
Now, incidentally, we can't show

458
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,388
that moment in the uk because of

459
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,124
their dumb law banning

460
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:28,494
parliamentary footage in comedy

461
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,733
shows, so when this airs there

462
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,503
tomorrow night, it'll be

463
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:34,839
replaced by a clip from a 1983

464
00:12:34,906 --> 00:12:36,074
chippendales exercise video

465
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:37,109
instead with absolutely no

466
00:12:37,176 --> 00:12:39,848
explanation.

467
00:12:39,915 --> 00:12:41,083
So this is what they'll see:

468
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,252
This is the moment the defeat

469
00:12:42,318 --> 00:12:43,254
was announced.

470
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,575
Yeah, that's what

471
00:12:54,642 --> 00:12:55,043
they'll get.

472
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:55,844
They'll be confused by it, and

473
00:12:55,911 --> 00:12:59,517
it'll be all their fault.

474
00:12:59,584 --> 00:13:00,085
The point is, the defeat of

475
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:00,519
Theresa may's deal

476
00:13:00,586 --> 00:13:01,621
raises the specter of what many

477
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:02,222
consider to be the worst-case

478
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:02,824
the uk dropping

479
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:03,691
out of the eu next month with no

480
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,395
transition plan in place.

481
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:06,664
It's the so-called no-deal

482
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,066
scenario, and the ramifications

483
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:09,502
of that could be massive, not

484
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:12,173
just for the uk or the eu, but

485
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,211
for the entire world.

486
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:16,014
So tonight, let's try and answer

487
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:17,917
why don't

488
00:13:17,985 --> 00:13:19,087
people like Theresa may's deal?

489
00:13:19,153 --> 00:13:20,188
What happens if the uk leaves

490
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,591
with no deal?

491
00:13:21,657 --> 00:13:23,094
And could they just not do

492
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,563
brexit at all?

493
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,665
And let's start with why

494
00:13:25,732 --> 00:13:26,801
parliament rejected her deal.

495
00:13:26,868 --> 00:13:27,936
There's a lot of reasons that

496
00:13:28,003 --> 00:13:29,138
people don't like it, but the

497
00:13:29,204 --> 00:13:30,240
biggest sticking point has to do

498
00:13:30,306 --> 00:13:31,442
with northern Ireland.

499
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:32,544
And let me explain here.

500
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,548
You see, the uk is actually four

501
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:36,251
england, Scotland,

502
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:38,488
wales, and northern Ireland.

503
00:13:38,555 --> 00:13:40,224
A fab four, sort of like the

504
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,861
Beatles.

505
00:13:41,928 --> 00:13:42,897
I won't say who the Ringo is,

506
00:13:42,963 --> 00:13:45,268
because that would be unfair to

507
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:46,537
wales.

508
00:13:46,603 --> 00:13:47,939
Now, northern Ireland shares a

509
00:13:47,973 --> 00:13:49,341
border with the Republic of

510
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:50,510
Ireland, and right now,

511
00:13:50,577 --> 00:13:51,947
everything you see here is part

512
00:13:52,014 --> 00:13:53,816
of the eu, so goods and people

513
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:55,587
can move freely between them.

514
00:13:55,654 --> 00:13:56,889
But the whole point of brexit is

515
00:13:56,956 --> 00:13:58,525
for the uk to leave the eu, and

516
00:13:58,592 --> 00:14:00,529
that could put a hard border

517
00:14:00,596 --> 00:14:02,032
across Ireland, and that could

518
00:14:02,098 --> 00:14:04,369
be a problem in a region that's

519
00:14:04,436 --> 00:14:05,973
been plagued by sectarian

520
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,241
violence.

521
00:14:07,308 --> 00:14:08,610
And I don't have time to get

522
00:14:08,678 --> 00:14:09,679
into the sociopolitical history

523
00:14:09,745 --> 00:14:12,084
of Ireland right now.

524
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,419
So feel free to Google

525
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:14,221
"ira bombings" or

526
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,290
"bloody Sunday," or

527
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:17,694
"Daniel day-Lewis' 1990s film

528
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,831
output" or -- do you know what?

529
00:14:19,898 --> 00:14:20,465
Do you know what?

530
00:14:20,532 --> 00:14:24,439
I'll just let the Cranberries

531
00:14:24,506 --> 00:14:25,274
10 seconds.

532
00:14:38,232 --> 00:14:39,133
That's basically it.

533
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,901
Tanks, bombs, guns, absolutely

534
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:41,403
no more than four chords.

535
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:42,305
You know, Ireland.

536
00:14:42,372 --> 00:14:43,208
In the "troubles," thousands of

537
00:14:43,274 --> 00:14:44,142
people died.

538
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,411
Businesses on the border were

539
00:14:45,478 --> 00:14:46,312
regularly bombed, and

540
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,849
checkpoints became targets.

541
00:14:47,915 --> 00:14:50,221
So removing them was a

542
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:51,957
centerpiece to the historic

543
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,426
good Friday agreement of 1998,

544
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:54,762
which brought a fragile peace to

545
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:57,233
the whole region.

546
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,869
Returning to checkpoints in any

547
00:14:58,936 --> 00:15:00,305
way, shape, or form is going to

548
00:15:00,371 --> 00:15:01,708
re-inflame tensions, as people

549
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,246
who live there know.

550
00:15:04,312 --> 00:15:06,083
If somebody builds a customs

551
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,686
post on the border between the

552
00:15:07,752 --> 00:15:08,888
north and Southern Ireland,

553
00:15:08,954 --> 00:15:10,390
people will shoot at it.

554
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:11,793
And they'll shoot at the people

555
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:13,329
who work at it.

556
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:14,732
That's absolutely 100% certain.

557
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:22,546
Wow.

558
00:15:22,612 --> 00:15:23,081
That is striking, because

559
00:15:23,147 --> 00:15:24,016
normally for people to

560
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:24,650
be that certain something will

561
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:25,584
be a disaster, they need to see

562
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:26,553
will Smith in blueface.

563
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:27,722
So everyone agrees there cannot

564
00:15:27,788 --> 00:15:29,292
be a hard border there again.

565
00:15:29,358 --> 00:15:31,528
But how do you avoid that?

566
00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:33,432
Because if you're not in the eu,

567
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,503
goods have to be screened

568
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,340
somewhere, like you would at any

569
00:15:37,406 --> 00:15:38,876
international border, and no one

570
00:15:38,943 --> 00:15:42,182
has yet come up with a plausible

571
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:42,583
solution for this.

572
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:43,284
Some, including former foreign

573
00:15:43,351 --> 00:15:44,552
secretary and untitled

574
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:45,654
Gary busey project

575
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:47,658
Boris Johnson, have proposed

576
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:48,761
elaborate workarounds, including

577
00:15:48,827 --> 00:15:50,063
technologies that don't yet

578
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,900
exist and customs screenings

579
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:55,240
near, but not at, the border.

580
00:15:55,306 --> 00:15:56,574
But Ireland is not remotely

581
00:15:56,641 --> 00:15:58,145
convinced by those.

582
00:15:58,211 --> 00:15:59,480
And when journalists pushed

583
00:15:59,547 --> 00:16:00,949
Boris Johnson for more details,

584
00:16:01,016 --> 00:16:02,286
his response did not inspire

585
00:16:02,353 --> 00:16:05,057
confidence.

586
00:16:05,124 --> 00:16:06,459
Nobody thinks it's a

587
00:16:06,526 --> 00:16:07,395
realistic plan, because they

588
00:16:07,461 --> 00:16:08,731
don't think Ireland would accept

589
00:16:08,798 --> 00:16:08,931
it.

590
00:16:08,998 --> 00:16:09,532
The eu does.

591
00:16:09,598 --> 00:16:10,333
Don't -- don't run away.

592
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:10,968
We want to ask you some serious

593
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:11,803
questions, because you've just

594
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:12,503
done a load of interviews, why

595
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:19,184
don't you talk to channel four?

596
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:19,818
And answer -- answer a couple of

597
00:16:19,884 --> 00:16:20,485
questions?

598
00:16:20,552 --> 00:16:21,086
You...

599
00:16:21,153 --> 00:16:22,088
This is absurd.

600
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:22,622
You want to have a serious

601
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:23,224
conversation about brexit and

602
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,359
then you ride off without

603
00:16:24,426 --> 00:16:24,693
talking to us.

604
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,494
Why can't you answer any serious

605
00:16:25,561 --> 00:16:26,197
questions?

606
00:16:26,263 --> 00:16:27,432
I'll tell you why Boris

607
00:16:27,498 --> 00:16:28,266
can't answer any serious

608
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:28,867
he doesn't have any

609
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:31,673
answers.

610
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:32,308
In fact, the only question he's

611
00:16:32,374 --> 00:16:32,975
ever capable of answering is,

612
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:34,110
"what would it look like if

613
00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:34,845
Gordon Ramsey was tumble-dried

614
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:39,587
on high?"

615
00:16:39,653 --> 00:16:40,389
So just in case no one comes up

616
00:16:40,456 --> 00:16:41,290
with a solution for this

617
00:16:41,357 --> 00:16:43,361
un-fixable problem by the end of

618
00:16:43,428 --> 00:16:44,529
the transition period, the eu

619
00:16:44,596 --> 00:16:45,432
and Theresa may agreed on

620
00:16:45,498 --> 00:16:52,677
something called a "backstop."

621
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:53,412
Now, under it, northern Ireland

622
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,348
would broadly live under eu

623
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:55,650
rules and there would be a hard

624
00:16:55,717 --> 00:16:56,952
border between it and the rest

625
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:58,121
of the uk, and that would remain

626
00:16:58,188 --> 00:16:59,323
in effect until they came up

627
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,993
with a permanent solution to the

628
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:01,961
border problem -- a solution

629
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:03,230
that, remember, does not exist.

630
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:06,136
The problem is, brexiteers have

631
00:17:06,203 --> 00:17:07,438
strong reservations about the

632
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:09,808
backstop, and they want Theresa

633
00:17:09,876 --> 00:17:10,844
may to renegotiate it.

634
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,614
But the eu says they're done

635
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:13,983
negotiating, leaving britain

636
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:14,852
hurtling towards the

637
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:16,121
ever-increasing possibility of

638
00:17:16,187 --> 00:17:17,456
leaving next month with no deal

639
00:17:17,524 --> 00:17:21,898
in place at all.

640
00:17:21,965 --> 00:17:23,301
So what happens if there is no

641
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,672
deal?

642
00:17:25,738 --> 00:17:27,375
Well, first -- ironically --

643
00:17:27,442 --> 00:17:29,211
there will be a hard border in

644
00:17:29,278 --> 00:17:30,047
Ireland, the one thing that

645
00:17:30,113 --> 00:17:33,920
everyone agrees they don't want.

646
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:34,688
But the consequences would go

647
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:35,756
much further than that, because

648
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:37,092
it won't just be the Irish

649
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,931
border where there'll be customs

650
00:17:39,998 --> 00:17:42,469
checks.

651
00:17:42,536 --> 00:17:43,137
Brand-new screenings will be

652
00:17:43,204 --> 00:17:44,340
required at every point of

653
00:17:44,406 --> 00:17:44,907
entry, and at major British

654
00:17:44,974 --> 00:17:45,575
ports like Dover, where trucks

655
00:17:45,641 --> 00:17:46,444
arrive on ferries, that could

656
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,445
mean chaos.

657
00:17:47,512 --> 00:17:48,146
Under a no-deal brexit,

658
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:48,880
world trade organization rules

659
00:17:48,947 --> 00:17:50,183
would kick in overnight, meaning

660
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:50,784
customs inspections on every

661
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:55,793
vehicle.

662
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,528
By one estimate, if customs

663
00:17:56,595 --> 00:17:57,564
delayed each truck by just

664
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,532
70 additional seconds, the wait

665
00:17:58,599 --> 00:17:59,534
to board the ferry could reach

666
00:17:59,601 --> 00:18:00,369
six days.

667
00:18:00,435 --> 00:18:02,406
Yeah, that is a massive

668
00:18:02,473 --> 00:18:04,209
problem, because the whole

669
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:06,012
system is built on seamless

670
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:11,489
movement.

671
00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:12,290
Introduce any hitch into that

672
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:12,991
system, and it all breaks down.

673
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:14,160
It's like being in a supermarket

674
00:18:14,228 --> 00:18:14,795
checkout when one person brings

675
00:18:14,862 --> 00:18:15,363
a fruit the cashier doesn't

676
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:15,829
know.

677
00:18:15,897 --> 00:18:16,731
Hold on a second.

678
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:18,368
You are not trying to buy a

679
00:18:18,402 --> 00:18:19,470
dragonfruit at a kroger at

680
00:18:19,537 --> 00:18:21,073
6:00 pm on a rainy Sunday.

681
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:27,585
Get the fuck out of here!

682
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:28,654
You drop that fruit!

683
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,327
You drop that fruit!

684
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:32,861
You drop it and walk away!

685
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:33,829
Not up in here!

686
00:18:33,897 --> 00:18:34,465
Not up in here!

687
00:18:34,532 --> 00:18:35,766
And perishable goods will be

688
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:36,401
particularly hard-hit by delays

689
00:18:36,468 --> 00:18:36,902
at ports, as this flower

690
00:18:36,968 --> 00:18:37,637
importer will tell you.

691
00:18:37,704 --> 00:18:38,639
If things get delayed, our

692
00:18:38,705 --> 00:18:39,941
shipping gets delayed, and we're

693
00:18:40,008 --> 00:18:41,611
trading with no -- no flowers.

694
00:18:41,678 --> 00:18:43,614
So we -- we need free movements

695
00:18:43,681 --> 00:18:45,552
and it will affect us.

696
00:18:45,618 --> 00:18:46,654
What's at stake for you if we

697
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,656
don't get this right now?

698
00:18:47,722 --> 00:18:49,192
Everything.

699
00:18:49,258 --> 00:18:50,594
My family, my house, everything,

700
00:18:50,661 --> 00:18:53,499
my staff.

701
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,134
You know, we've been trading for

702
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:54,501
33 years.

703
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:55,269
Yeah, that's very sad

704
00:18:55,336 --> 00:18:56,638
because people do tend to want

705
00:18:56,705 --> 00:18:58,808
flowers now and alive.

706
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,946
Although you may feel slightly

707
00:19:01,012 --> 00:19:02,950
less sorry for that man when you

708
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,319
hear what he said next.

709
00:19:04,385 --> 00:19:05,589
You know, we've been trading

710
00:19:05,655 --> 00:19:06,890
for 33 years.

711
00:19:06,957 --> 00:19:08,293
And I did vote to leave.

712
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,163
Do you regret that?

713
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,600
I definitely have second

714
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:14,237
thoughts now, but --

715
00:19:14,271 --> 00:19:15,573
but when you voted "leave,"

716
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,378
did you not think, "well, this

717
00:19:18,445 --> 00:19:19,313
is gonna affect my flowers?"

718
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,582
I didn't really think about

719
00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:21,451
it like that.

720
00:19:21,518 --> 00:19:22,318
I didn't really think about the

721
00:19:22,385 --> 00:19:23,287
business side of it.

722
00:19:23,354 --> 00:19:24,021
Yeah, well, you

723
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:24,856
probably should've done,

724
00:19:24,923 --> 00:19:26,125
shouldn't you?

725
00:19:26,192 --> 00:19:27,327
And now, you've pretty much

726
00:19:27,395 --> 00:19:29,331
fucked yourself with a rusty

727
00:19:29,398 --> 00:19:30,133
piece of rebar.

728
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,402
Which isn't offensive, it's

729
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:32,371
something I saw on a mug, so

730
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,107
it's fine.

731
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:41,020
The mug makes it okay, Mary.

732
00:19:41,086 --> 00:19:44,025
You trust a mug always.

733
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:45,428
Now, look, the chilling prospect

734
00:19:45,495 --> 00:19:46,863
of a no-deal brexit has now

735
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:47,532
become likely enough that the

736
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:48,567
government has released over a

737
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:49,235
hundred guidance documents

738
00:19:49,302 --> 00:19:54,511
instructing people about what to

739
00:19:54,578 --> 00:19:55,179
do if it does happen, everything

740
00:19:55,246 --> 00:19:55,747
from how pesticides will be

741
00:19:55,814 --> 00:19:56,415
regulated to what the new

742
00:19:56,481 --> 00:19:57,115
procedures would be for taking

743
00:19:57,182 --> 00:19:58,117
your horse abroad.

744
00:19:58,184 --> 00:19:58,752
Although I think I can actually

745
00:19:58,819 --> 00:19:59,320
solve that one for you right

746
00:19:59,386 --> 00:20:00,188
take off its shoes, put it

747
00:20:00,255 --> 00:20:01,324
in a separate tray, and look

748
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,292
innocently confused when airport

749
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:03,595
security starts asking whose

750
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:08,503
fucking horse this is.

751
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,539
And while some of what will

752
00:20:09,606 --> 00:20:10,907
happen in a no-deal scenario may

753
00:20:10,974 --> 00:20:11,876
go into the category of

754
00:20:11,942 --> 00:20:13,212
"manageable annoyance," there

755
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,581
are some genuinely alarming

756
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:15,950
issues like, will there be a

757
00:20:16,017 --> 00:20:17,186
shortage of medication that

758
00:20:17,253 --> 00:20:18,588
comes from other countries that

759
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:19,624
could affect someone like this

760
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,659
girl with cerebral palsy and

761
00:20:20,726 --> 00:20:22,161
epilepsy?

762
00:20:22,228 --> 00:20:23,230
She has three drugs that she

763
00:20:23,297 --> 00:20:24,734
has that are critical, and

764
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,270
without them, she will have

765
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:28,574
multiple seizures in a day.

766
00:20:28,641 --> 00:20:30,243
It's one of the biggest

767
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,646
countries in the world,

768
00:20:31,712 --> 00:20:33,483
financially, and I'm sitting

769
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:34,551
here thinking, "will I be able

770
00:20:34,618 --> 00:20:35,452
to get medicine in two months'

771
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:40,361
time?"

772
00:20:40,428 --> 00:20:41,463
It's a completely crazy

773
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:46,707
situation.

774
00:20:46,774 --> 00:20:47,975
You are right about

775
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:49,378
that, because medicine shortages

776
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:50,547
are not a problem that britons

777
00:20:50,614 --> 00:20:50,981
expect to deal with.

778
00:20:51,048 --> 00:20:51,582
They're used to having their

779
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:52,518
problems limited to hearing

780
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,152
Americans mispronounce the word

781
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:54,086
"vitamin."

782
00:20:54,154 --> 00:20:55,256
Not having enough beans as part

783
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:56,023
of your breakfast, and having to

784
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:56,926
wait 20 years for another royal

785
00:20:56,992 --> 00:20:57,760
wedding.

786
00:20:57,827 --> 00:20:58,529
How are you still single,

787
00:20:58,595 --> 00:20:59,798
George?

788
00:20:59,864 --> 00:21:00,933
Settle down already, you're this

789
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:02,469
many.

790
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:03,871
Find a fiancee for us to

791
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:06,977
ferociously judge.

792
00:21:07,043 --> 00:21:07,779
And if all of this is not

793
00:21:07,846 --> 00:21:09,281
already frightening enough,

794
00:21:09,348 --> 00:21:10,551
there are warnings of empty

795
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:13,556
shelves, and some britons have

796
00:21:13,622 --> 00:21:14,926
begun stockpiling food or buying

797
00:21:14,992 --> 00:21:16,227
so-called "brexit boxes," which,

798
00:21:16,294 --> 00:21:17,731
when you see what's actually

799
00:21:17,797 --> 00:21:22,706
inside them, seems pretty grim.

800
00:21:22,773 --> 00:21:23,575
They may look like tins of

801
00:21:23,641 --> 00:21:25,010
paint, but they could be dinner

802
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:26,914
a la brexit.

803
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:28,049
Every brexit box contains all

804
00:21:28,116 --> 00:21:29,385
you need to whip up family

805
00:21:29,451 --> 00:21:30,821
favorites like chili con carne,

806
00:21:30,888 --> 00:21:33,961
chicken tikka, and even fajitas.

807
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:35,730
Now, putting aside how

808
00:21:35,797 --> 00:21:37,198
unappetizing a paint can of wet

809
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:38,769
meat sounds, let's also not

810
00:21:38,835 --> 00:21:40,471
overlook the metaphorical

811
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:41,808
significance of every dish in

812
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,143
the brexit box being something

813
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,346
that came to britain from

814
00:21:44,413 --> 00:21:45,548
another country and greatly

815
00:21:45,615 --> 00:21:46,717
improved the lives of everyone

816
00:21:46,784 --> 00:21:48,286
there.

817
00:21:48,353 --> 00:21:50,289
Now, things look dire here.

818
00:21:50,357 --> 00:21:52,393
Under any form of brexit,

819
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,529
britain's economic options are

820
00:21:53,596 --> 00:21:55,533
basically "bad" and "worse."

821
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,735
The government's own analysis

822
00:21:56,802 --> 00:21:57,938
suggests that, under a brexit

823
00:21:58,005 --> 00:21:59,540
like Theresa may's plan, the uk

824
00:21:59,607 --> 00:22:01,610
economy could be up to 3.9%

825
00:22:01,677 --> 00:22:03,180
smaller after 15 years.

826
00:22:03,246 --> 00:22:05,718
Which sounds bad until you learn

827
00:22:05,785 --> 00:22:07,455
that under a no-deal brexit,

828
00:22:07,521 --> 00:22:09,124
we're looking at an economy as

829
00:22:09,191 --> 00:22:11,261
much as 9.3% smaller.

830
00:22:11,328 --> 00:22:12,330
And a slowdown like that would

831
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,599
not just hurt britain -- it

832
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,969
would ripple across the whole

833
00:22:15,036 --> 00:22:25,354
world.

834
00:22:25,421 --> 00:22:26,122
And yet, incredibly, some in

835
00:22:26,188 --> 00:22:26,891
britain remain completely

836
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:27,758
unfazed by all this, drawing

837
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:28,527
confidence from the worst

838
00:22:28,594 --> 00:22:29,461
possible examples.

839
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:30,196
I lost a grandfather in the

840
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:31,432
first world war, I lost an uncle

841
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:32,067
in the second world war, and we

842
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:32,834
survived.

843
00:22:32,902 --> 00:22:33,736
Are you not a little bit

844
00:22:33,803 --> 00:22:34,838
concerned that we're talking

845
00:22:34,905 --> 00:22:35,640
about this political event the

846
00:22:35,707 --> 00:22:37,142
same way that we're talking

847
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:37,878
about the aftermath of

848
00:22:37,944 --> 00:22:39,514
world wars?

849
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,649
No, I'm not.

850
00:22:40,716 --> 00:22:41,618
I think it's the same sort of

851
00:22:41,684 --> 00:22:42,720
situation.

852
00:22:42,786 --> 00:22:43,955
But it isn't, though,

853
00:22:44,022 --> 00:22:44,489
is it?

854
00:22:44,556 --> 00:22:45,257
Because the world wars were

855
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:46,192
provoked.

856
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:47,561
They were a response to outside

857
00:22:47,629 --> 00:22:48,196
events.

858
00:22:48,263 --> 00:22:49,532
Brexit is something britain's

859
00:22:49,598 --> 00:22:53,873
done to itself.

860
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,607
Britain is basically Pompeii if

861
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:55,777
Pompeii had voted for the

862
00:22:55,844 --> 00:22:56,778
volcano.

863
00:22:56,845 --> 00:22:57,880
"A bus said the volcano would be

864
00:22:57,947 --> 00:22:58,649
good!

865
00:22:58,715 --> 00:22:59,717
I believe the bus!

866
00:22:59,784 --> 00:23:01,654
And a mug backed it up!

867
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,862
You trust mugs!"

868
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:07,131
And this brings us to the final

869
00:23:07,197 --> 00:23:07,698
question here.

870
00:23:07,765 --> 00:23:08,767
If all of this going to be so

871
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:09,669
bad, could britain just not do

872
00:23:09,735 --> 00:23:10,503
this?

873
00:23:10,571 --> 00:23:11,639
To which the answer is,

874
00:23:11,706 --> 00:23:13,242
technically, yes.

875
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,276
In December, the European court

876
00:23:14,344 --> 00:23:15,580
of justice ruled that the uk can

877
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:17,316
simply revoke its intention to

878
00:23:17,382 --> 00:23:18,518
withdraw.

879
00:23:18,585 --> 00:23:19,453
That is a big indication that

880
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,724
Europe would take us back.

881
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:25,598
And an even bigger indication is

882
00:23:25,664 --> 00:23:26,466
the existence of the

883
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:27,935
breunion boys, a Dutch group who

884
00:23:28,003 --> 00:23:29,672
describe themselves as a

885
00:23:29,739 --> 00:23:30,908
"boy band driven to re-unite

886
00:23:30,975 --> 00:23:33,879
Great Britain with the eu."

887
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,015
And if you think they didn't

888
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,084
make a music video, you clearly

889
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,286
don't understand why I'm

890
00:23:37,353 --> 00:23:39,523
bringing this up.

891
00:24:00,763 --> 00:24:06,372
Dope.

892
00:24:06,439 --> 00:24:14,054
I mean, it's the classic

893
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,922
boy band formula, isn't it?

894
00:24:14,989 --> 00:24:15,589
You get five eurotrash hunks,

895
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:16,892
dress two like fishermen, two

896
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:17,894
like guys who run a vc firm, and

897
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,461
one like a marxist guerrilla

898
00:24:18,528 --> 00:24:19,096
with a throat cold, put them on

899
00:24:19,163 --> 00:24:19,663
the world's grayest, dankest

900
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:20,265
beach, and have them croon in

901
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:20,765
different keys about the

902
00:24:20,832 --> 00:24:23,337
dissolution of a customs union.

903
00:24:23,403 --> 00:24:26,676
It's just textbook.

904
00:24:26,743 --> 00:24:27,511
And look, if I'm honest, that

905
00:24:27,578 --> 00:24:28,213
clip doesn't make a completely

906
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,514
airtight case for staying in the

907
00:24:29,581 --> 00:24:30,149
eu, but the rap break certainly

908
00:24:30,217 --> 00:24:31,251
does.

909
00:24:40,936 --> 00:24:42,973
Hold on.

910
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,646
Hold on there.

911
00:24:46,713 --> 00:24:48,317
You really think British people

912
00:24:48,383 --> 00:24:48,884
are going to be impressed by

913
00:24:48,951 --> 00:24:49,886
your abs?

914
00:24:49,953 --> 00:24:51,388
We're British.

915
00:24:51,455 --> 00:24:53,492
If there's one thing people know

916
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:54,527
about us, it's that we all have

917
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:55,830
spectacular abs.

918
00:24:55,897 --> 00:24:56,865
Look, mine are obviously

919
00:24:56,932 --> 00:24:58,335
amazing.

920
00:24:58,401 --> 00:24:59,904
The queen's are completely

921
00:24:59,971 --> 00:25:01,540
insane.

922
00:25:01,607 --> 00:25:02,842
So why don't you take your

923
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:03,844
little eurozone four-pack and

924
00:25:03,911 --> 00:25:06,482
hit the gym, pencil-neck.

925
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:08,653
And while, clearly, that band is

926
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,157
a pretty solid argument for

927
00:25:10,223 --> 00:25:11,926
leaving the eu on any terms

928
00:25:11,993 --> 00:25:13,897
necessary, what if britain did

929
00:25:13,963 --> 00:25:15,166
want to stay?

930
00:25:15,232 --> 00:25:16,802
How would that even happen?

931
00:25:16,868 --> 00:25:18,137
Well, Theresa may and parliament

932
00:25:18,205 --> 00:25:19,606
could weigh the evidence and

933
00:25:19,673 --> 00:25:20,809
decide that brexit is not worth

934
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:21,610
it.

935
00:25:21,677 --> 00:25:22,646
That would be the truly

936
00:25:22,712 --> 00:25:24,148
courageous thing to do.

937
00:25:24,216 --> 00:25:25,017
They won't do it because of the

938
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,453
political backlash they'd get

939
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:27,721
for defying the popular will.

940
00:25:27,788 --> 00:25:29,591
But that is why some have

941
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:33,199
suggested a second referendum.

942
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:34,167
Now, that would not be easy.

943
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:38,775
First, the shortest estimate of

944
00:25:38,842 --> 00:25:40,212
the time it would take to

945
00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:41,613
organize a vote is 22 weeks, and

946
00:25:41,681 --> 00:25:42,382
there's just six weeks left.

947
00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:43,050
And also, what, exactly, would

948
00:25:43,116 --> 00:25:44,085
people vote on?

949
00:25:44,152 --> 00:25:44,919
Would it be remain in the eu

950
00:25:44,987 --> 00:25:46,389
versus Theresa may's brexit?

951
00:25:46,456 --> 00:25:47,692
Or remain versus the no-deal

952
00:25:47,758 --> 00:25:49,661
brexit?

953
00:25:49,728 --> 00:25:50,730
Or do you put all three options

954
00:25:50,797 --> 00:25:52,167
on the ballot, probably split

955
00:25:52,234 --> 00:25:53,302
the vote, fail to get a clear

956
00:25:53,369 --> 00:25:54,371
majority for any option, and

957
00:25:54,438 --> 00:25:55,772
somehow make this whole mess

958
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,409
even worse?

959
00:25:57,477 --> 00:25:58,712
Because the reality is, this

960
00:25:58,778 --> 00:26:02,953
situation is far too complex for

961
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,192
an up-or-down referendum, which,

962
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,499
by the way, was also true of the

963
00:26:09,565 --> 00:26:11,101
first fucking one, because when

964
00:26:11,168 --> 00:26:13,839
voters were just asked to leave

965
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:15,676
or stay without a sense of what

966
00:26:15,743 --> 00:26:16,211
that might actually mean.

967
00:26:16,278 --> 00:26:16,878
The first referendum was a

968
00:26:16,945 --> 00:26:17,813
terrible idea, because it was

969
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,515
the government punting a

970
00:26:18,581 --> 00:26:19,249
difficult decision to the

971
00:26:19,317 --> 00:26:20,084
people, which, in the people's

972
00:26:20,151 --> 00:26:21,687
defense, is not their job.

973
00:26:21,754 --> 00:26:22,689
They elect politicians to make

974
00:26:22,756 --> 00:26:25,227
reasoned, fact-based decisions

975
00:26:25,294 --> 00:26:26,829
on their behalf.

976
00:26:26,896 --> 00:26:28,166
That's how representative

977
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:29,601
democracy works.

978
00:26:29,702 --> 00:26:30,736
And you know who could've told

979
00:26:30,804 --> 00:26:32,942
you all of this at the time?

980
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,479
The people of "gogglebox."

981
00:26:35,546 --> 00:26:36,515
Just watch them react to the

982
00:26:36,581 --> 00:26:38,251
referendum being announced in

983
00:26:38,318 --> 00:26:39,887
2016.

984
00:26:39,954 --> 00:26:41,056
Do you think everybody knows

985
00:26:41,122 --> 00:26:43,394
enough to be able to vote?

986
00:26:43,461 --> 00:26:45,397
I know there must be other

987
00:26:45,464 --> 00:26:46,967
people like me.

988
00:26:47,033 --> 00:26:50,773
This is what's worrying me.

989
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,744
I'm worried that people aren't

990
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:53,980
well-informed enough to make the

991
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:55,782
decision.

992
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:57,086
It's such a big decision.

993
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:00,625
I don't understand it.

994
00:27:00,691 --> 00:27:01,461
And then I don't want to vote on

995
00:27:01,527 --> 00:27:02,261
something that I don't really

996
00:27:02,328 --> 00:27:02,963
truly understand.

997
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:03,731
Right.

998
00:27:03,797 --> 00:27:04,699
That is an intelligent thing to

999
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:05,701
say.

1000
00:27:05,768 --> 00:27:06,837
Sometimes you don't know stuff,

1001
00:27:06,903 --> 00:27:07,905
so you hire someone else to know

1002
00:27:07,972 --> 00:27:10,042
it for you.

1003
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,946
If you came to your doctor with

1004
00:27:12,013 --> 00:27:13,181
stomach pain, and he said,

1005
00:27:13,248 --> 00:27:15,085
"well, what do you think?

1006
00:27:15,152 --> 00:27:16,287
Should your appendix leave or

1007
00:27:16,354 --> 00:27:17,088
remain?"

1008
00:27:17,156 --> 00:27:17,790
You'd probably say, "don't ask

1009
00:27:17,857 --> 00:27:18,625
me.

1010
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:21,864
Do your fucking job!"

1011
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,634
Look, a true act of political

1012
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:25,371
courage at this point wouldn't

1013
00:27:25,438 --> 00:27:26,839
be to call for a second

1014
00:27:26,906 --> 00:27:31,616
referendum -- something

1015
00:27:31,682 --> 00:27:32,917
that Theresa may's already said

1016
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:33,520
she won't do.

1017
00:27:33,586 --> 00:27:34,320
It would be to acknowledge that

1018
00:27:34,387 --> 00:27:35,055
the first one was fatally flawed

1019
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:36,023
and that carrying it out will do

1020
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:36,825
long-term damage to the country

1021
00:27:36,892 --> 00:27:37,593
and then canceling brexit

1022
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,695
altogether.

1023
00:27:38,761 --> 00:27:40,098
But it seems that there is no

1024
00:27:40,165 --> 00:27:42,803
way that's happening.

1025
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,138
Instead, britain seems

1026
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:45,608
determined to step firmly down

1027
00:27:45,675 --> 00:27:46,810
upon the rake of history and

1028
00:27:46,876 --> 00:27:48,914
suffer the consequences.

1029
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,351
And I wish I could offer you a

1030
00:27:51,418 --> 00:27:52,787
rousing, churchillian speech now

1031
00:27:52,854 --> 00:27:54,056
about how everything's going to

1032
00:27:54,123 --> 00:27:55,960
be okay, but under the

1033
00:27:56,027 --> 00:27:57,830
circumstances, honestly, the

1034
00:27:57,896 --> 00:28:02,506
best I can offer you is this.

1035
00:28:02,573 --> 00:28:04,843
People of britain, throughout

1036
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:06,613
history, we've faced our share

1037
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,949
of dark hours.

1038
00:28:08,015 --> 00:28:09,218
The great war.

1039
00:28:09,284 --> 00:28:10,721
The blitz.

1040
00:28:10,787 --> 00:28:12,257
And that time when Deborah

1041
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:14,561
accidentally used Howard's

1042
00:28:14,628 --> 00:28:16,264
custard in her own trifle.

1043
00:28:16,364 --> 00:28:17,266
That's my custard.

1044
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:19,102
Oh, no.

1045
00:28:19,136 --> 00:28:22,442
So sorry, Howard.

1046
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:23,878
And through all this, our

1047
00:28:23,944 --> 00:28:25,481
stiff upper lip has prevailed,

1048
00:28:25,548 --> 00:28:27,050
because this country is not for

1049
00:28:27,117 --> 00:28:28,153
turning, not when other

1050
00:28:28,219 --> 00:28:31,993
countries have tried to destroy

1051
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:33,730
us and not when we are in the

1052
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:34,364
midst of trying to destroy

1053
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,566
ourselves.

1054
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:36,468
And I know some are yelling,

1055
00:28:36,535 --> 00:28:37,670
britain, come back, don't do

1056
00:28:37,737 --> 00:28:38,605
this!

1057
00:28:38,672 --> 00:28:40,475
You're pointlessly fucking

1058
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:43,346
yourselves!

1059
00:28:43,414 --> 00:28:45,618
And to them, we say, oh, we have

1060
00:28:45,685 --> 00:28:47,153
not even begun to fuck

1061
00:28:47,221 --> 00:28:49,992
ourselves.

1062
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:51,629
We shall fuck ourselves at the

1063
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:52,731
ports.

1064
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:53,899
We shall fuck ourselves at the

1065
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:58,776
shops.

1066
00:28:58,842 --> 00:28:59,910
We shall fuck ourselves in the

1067
00:28:59,977 --> 00:29:01,079
hospitals and in the fields.

1068
00:29:01,146 --> 00:29:03,150
We shall never surrender.

1069
00:29:03,217 --> 00:29:04,619
And when the dust clears, what

1070
00:29:04,687 --> 00:29:06,790
will remain?

1071
00:29:06,857 --> 00:29:08,226
Britain.

1072
00:29:08,292 --> 00:29:09,361
Not the same britain, certainly.

1073
00:29:09,428 --> 00:29:10,997
A worse one with a weaker

1074
00:29:11,064 --> 00:29:13,402
economy.

1075
00:29:13,469 --> 00:29:14,571
Possibly no fresh fruit and a

1076
00:29:14,638 --> 00:29:16,307
great deal of confusion over how

1077
00:29:16,374 --> 00:29:17,409
horses can go on holiday.

1078
00:29:18,545 --> 00:29:22,619
But britain nonetheless.

1079
00:29:22,686 --> 00:29:25,056
And once we have delivered this

1080
00:29:25,123 --> 00:29:27,629
mortal wound to ourselves, we

1081
00:29:27,695 --> 00:29:29,665
will savor the taste of victory,

1082
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:32,537
a victory that tastes like

1083
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,240
mummified chicken fajitas!

1084
00:29:38,749 --> 00:29:43,658
That's our show,

1085
00:29:43,724 --> 00:29:44,526
thanks so much for watching.

1086
00:29:44,593 --> 00:29:46,061
See you next week, good night!
