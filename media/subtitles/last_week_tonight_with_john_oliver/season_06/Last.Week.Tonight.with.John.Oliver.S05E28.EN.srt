LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,480
SEASON VI
EPISODE 28

3
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,720
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,520
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,800
Let's dive straight in
with the latest in the scandal

6
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,680
we're calling Stupid Watergate II:
Revenge Of The Ding Dong Dingus.

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,560
Despite the fact that Trump continues
to repeat "no quid pro quo"

8
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,880
like it's an invincibility spell
he learned at Hogwarts,

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,240
the number of witnesses telling
Congress the opposite rised.

10
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,760
Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman,
the first official to testify

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,160
who was on Trump's phone call
with the president of Ukraine.

12
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,960
His account was so damning,

13
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,600
some the president's defenders
desperately tried to use the fact

14
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,120
he was actually born in Ukraine
to smear him.

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,520
Here we have a U.S. national
security official

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,800
who is advising Ukraine
while working inside the White House

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,680
apparently against
the president's interests

18
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,800
and usually
they spoke in English.

19
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,520
Isn't that kind of an interesting
angle on this story ?

20
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,440
I find that astounding. Some people
might call that "espionage".

21
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:44,680
If "some people" call it espionage,
those people are just wrong.

22
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,280
"Some people" might call a boat
a "wet metal mommy".

23
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,880
That's not what it is, anyone who
calls it that is weird and stupid.

24
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,880
Attacking Vindman's patriotism would be
despicable regardless of credentials.

25
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,040
Not only is he a war veteran

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,080
who was awarded a Purple Heart
for his service in Iraq,

27
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,680
as a child, he appeared in a Ken Burns
film about the Statue of Liberty

28
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,520
and what it means
to generations of immigrants.

29
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,840
Ken Burns even tweeted
that clip out this week, saying:

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,080
"I remember the Vindman boys. Theirs
is the story of America at its best."

31
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,760
Which is a solid endorsement.
Although I do have to say,

32
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,880
me reading that tweet didn't convey
the full Ken Burns spirit.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,760
So, Ken, please,
take it away !

34
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,680
The place was America.
The year was now.

35
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,560
The person, Ken Burns, was me,
Ken Burns.

36
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,920
The memory was one of me
remembering the Vindman boys fondly.

37
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,160
They represent America at its best.

38
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,080
Baseball, jazz, country music,
Ken Burns.

39
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,080
Yeah, that's much more like it.
Thank you, Ken Burns.

40
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,840
The smears of Vindman are a good
indication of how Republicans

41
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,560
are running out of ways
to defend the president.

42
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,920
House Democrats moved to take
away another major argument

43
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,240
against the impeachment inquiry, that
hadn't been authorized in the House.

44
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,600
They held a vote
to formalize the process

45
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,720
and set rules for its public phase,
Republicans fiercely objected,

46
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,960
Steve Scalise choosing to do so with
the help of an ill-advised visual aid.

47
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,680
This is unprecedented !

48
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,440
It's not only unprecedented,
this is Soviet-style rules !

49
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,160
Maybe in the Soviet Union
you do things like this,

50
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,000
where only you make the rules.

51
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,320
Where you reject the ability
for the person you're accusing

52
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,200
to even be in the room,
to question what's going on.

53
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,080
Yeah, that happened. To defend
Trump, he used a picture of Red Square,

54
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,080
reminding us
there's a whole second category

55
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,520
of possibly-impeachable
Trump conduct.

56
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,360
Like Harvey Weinstein saying:

57
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,800
"I know you're mad at me
for one thing,"

58
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,160
"but I also
produced 'She's All That',"

59
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,120
"with the message: if people
are judging your physical appearance,"

60
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,800
"get hot, and then you win."

61
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,760
"That was me, too. Sorry, poor word
choice there. Anyway, bye for now !"

62
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,240
Scalise was joined in
his outrage by Kevin McCarthy,

63
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,560
answer to the question:
"What would Mitt Romney look like"

64
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,640
"if he ever had to worry about money
like other people ?"

65
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,280
McCarthy attempted to denounce
Democrats with Churchillian rhetoric.

66
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,200
Unfortunately, he didn't
quite stick the landing.

67
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,400
This is the moment
that history will write,

68
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,880
history will ask you
when you cast this vote,

69
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,040
the vote to justify something that
has gone on behind closed doors,

70
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,800
I want you to ask the historian
and answer the question:

71
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,400
"What do you know
that happened there ?"

72
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,400
Nailed it.

73
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,480
Yes, this is the moment
when history talks to you !

74
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,320
History can talk now, and it will
ask you questions about this vote !

75
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,160
I want you
to ask the historian !

76
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,160
His name is Greg, by the way,
Greg the historian !

77
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,360
Greg is the historian of history times,
a very nice man.

78
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,600
Before Greg can answer, I want
you to answer the question:

79
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,920
"What do you know
that happened there ?"

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,960
And what you will tell them is that
McCarthy did not write down his speech.

81
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,640
He just started talking and he hoped
come up with something good

82
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,600
and he was sorely fucking
disappointed in himself.

83
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,840
It might be a sign of how desperate
Trump getting that on Thursday,

84
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,800
this was his idea for how
best to articulate his defense.

85
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,520
The president said: "This is over
a phone call that is a good call."

86
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,400
"At some point, I'm going to sit
down, perhaps as a fireside chat"

87
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,840
"and I will read the transcript,
because people have to hear it."

88
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,520
That is not a good idea.

89
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,760
Because even in its abridged form,
the call summary is damning.

90
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,800
There is no way Trump has
the attention span to sit down

91
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,720
and read a 2 000 word document
on live television without losing focus

92
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,520
and going wildly off-topic.

93
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,440
If you told him to read
"Hop On Pop," by page three,

94
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,440
he'd be rambling about how great
chicken tenders are at Mar-a-Lago,

95
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,280
how zebras are just loser horses,
and how he invented the word "dog".

96
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,360
Despite the mounting
evidence against him,

97
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,480
Trump insists this is "The Greatest
Witch Hunt In American History !"

98
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,760
His website started to sell these
"Stop The Witch-Hunt!" t-shirts,

99
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,080
an item of clothing that I've become
obsessed with this week.

100
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,640
Look at this graphic.
What seems to have happened is...

101
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,400
Someone took the poster from
the 1993 film "Hocus Pocus"

102
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,400
removed the dark outfits,
the moon,

103
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,680
and basically all the details
that have to do with witches

104
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,400
and replaced the witches' faces
with Pelosi, Schiff and Nadler.

105
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,400
It's a witch hunt where the witches
are the ones doing the hunting.

106
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,360
Which is categorically
not what a witch hunt is,

107
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,680
in the same way a duck hunt

108
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,960
doesn't mean a bunch of ducks
hunting humans in the woods.

109
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:08,360
On the shirt, Trump is depicted
as a flying superhero,

110
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,240
which has no place
in the witch genre.

111
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,440
The product description
confuses this issue further:

112
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,880
"The only people scared
this Halloween are Shifty Schiff,"

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,520
"Nervous Nancy and Hack Jerry Nadler
about their chances in 2020 !"

114
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,360
In this witch hunt, the witches,
even though they are the hunter,

115
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,640
are the scared ones,
the only scared ones, in fact.

116
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,680
It's still the "Greatest Witch Hunt
In The History",

117
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,040
but only three people are scared
and all of them are witches.

118
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,480
The shirt makes no sense
and it prompts so many questions.

119
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,880
My main one being, does it come
in a man's extra-medium ?

120
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,600
I'm going to want a relic
to show my grandchildren in the future

121
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,240
when they refuse to believe that
any of this shit ever happened.

122
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,840
And now this.

123
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:04,320
MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace Has A Real
Problem With This President.

124
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,680
This is a president who will stand
there and lie his you-know-bleep off.

125
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,840
This could undermine his brand,
make him look like he's full of bleep.

126
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,200
Trump doesn't give a bleep-hole
country about Bill Barr.

127
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,440
Doesn't give a bleep
about any of them.

128
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,920
That's big
holy bleep kind of trouble.

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,520
You lose "The Wall Street Journal",
you're bleeped.

130
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,080
When you've lost Fox News,
you're bleeped.

131
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,880
They'll talk
about what a bleep-show it all was.

132
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,240
Do you think any of them
call him and say:

133
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,600
"That tweet you just sent out ?
Totally bleeping bonkers."

134
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,520
Isn't that an interesting angle
on this story ?

135
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,480
I find that astounding, some
people might call that "espionage".

136
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,800
Except those people aren't
chicken-shit like the three of you.

137
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,960
Moving on.

138
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,080
Our main story
tonight concerns voting.

139
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,160
It's the only way to get Sean Spicer
off "Dancing With The Stars".

140
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,640
So far, he's danced
the "Red Wedding",

141
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,520
the "Woody From Toy Story
After His Third Divorce" and this.

142
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,600
Cool.

143
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,080
He is dressed and dancing there
like the "Chernobyl Musketeer".

144
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,920
Please, America: put this man
out of everyone's misery.

145
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,280
It might be a good time to talk about
voting, Election Day is this Tuesday.

146
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,960
Yes, there are elections this Tuesday.
Depending on where you live,

147
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,360
you could be voting for
your governor, your state legislator

148
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,680
or even your city comptroller,
a very important position.

149
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,960
They comptrol the city.
Without them,

150
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,560
the city would be
completely out of comptrol.

151
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,760
Before you vote, which you
should, it may be worth asking:

152
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,000
how much do you trust
the system that counts your ballot ?

153
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,200
Many of us don't know the first thing
about how our votes get counted.

154
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,600
When you cast your ballot, how do
you know they're getting it right ?

155
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,960
- That they're getting it right ?
- Yeah.

156
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,320
Isn't that their job
to get it right ?

157
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,880
Do you trust that your vote
is being recorded as intended ?

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,600
- I think so.
- What are you basing that on ?

159
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,840
How do you know
that they got it right ?

160
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,760
I'm sure they did.

161
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,920
We put it in the machine. I assume
they're going to read it correctly.

162
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,560
But how do you know
they're getting it right ?

163
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,760
There's no such thing as being dead
sure but I think I'm quite sure.

164
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,600
I get the point the interviewer's
trying to make,

165
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,040
but he is coming on
pretty strong there.

166
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,560
How are you so sure
they got your vote right ?

167
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,440
'Cause you're a stupid
child in a dumb adult's body ?

168
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,720
You were born yesterday
in a voting booth

169
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,960
and the first thing you did
was vote like a newborn idiot ?

170
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,640
Do you pull a tooth out with pliers,
and then lie there

171
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,520
waiting for the Tooth Fairy
to suck you off ?

172
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,320
Do you do that ? Do you lose sleep
waiting for Tooth Fairy blowjobs ?

173
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,960
Then how do you know
they got your vote right ?

174
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,480
His overall point is decent:

175
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,760
we don't always know how
our votes are being counted.

176
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,720
It's not unreasonable to have
questions about our election security.

177
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,400
In 2016, Russian hackers targeted
election systems in all 50 states.

178
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,400
What they were targeting back then
was voter registration data.

179
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,440
As for the voting machines,
to hear some local officials tell it,

180
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,640
they could not be more secure.

181
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,680
I could set one of these machines
in the middle of Red Square

182
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,920
and the Russians
couldn't hack into it.

183
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,960
Don't do that. Because they can hack
into it, they're Russians.

184
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,080
There are precisely three things
that they are good at: hacking, hockey

185
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,480
and writing books so sad
they make you want to drink a potato.

186
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,160
As you will see tonight,

187
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,600
leaving our voting machines
in the middle of Moscow

188
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,280
or, indeed, the middle of America,
might not be the best idea.

189
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,920
A Senate report found that some of
our voting equipment is aging

190
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,240
and vulnerable to exploitation
by a committed adversary.

191
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,480
Let's talk about
our voting machines.

192
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,080
And first, there is no single, standard
voting system in this country.

193
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,120
In some places,
you vote by filling out a paper ballot

194
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,880
and feeding it into a machine.

195
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,360
At others, you press a button,
get a printout

196
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,480
and have that scanned
into a machine.

197
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,720
And at still others, you press
a touchscreen and that's it.

198
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,360
While that last option
may seem like the best,

199
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,320
it's actually, for reasons
that we'll get into later, the worst.

200
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,320
The reason most of us vote
on electronic machines

201
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,240
has to do with the 2000 election.

202
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,680
For those of you too young
to remember that,

203
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,600
first, I've got to ask you:
is "Euphoria" accurate ?

204
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,160
Are you all horny,
sparkly drug addicts ?

205
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,160
I'm curious, I don't know
any teens and I suspect

206
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,680
the people behind "Euphoria"
don't either.

207
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,640
Second: very basically,
the 2000 election came down

208
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,200
to over a thousand votes in Florida,
which triggered a recount,

209
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,240
which turned out to be
a nightmare.

210
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,320
Many key Florida precincts
used punch-card ballots.

211
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,920
A major issue with punch card
ballots was the fact that, on some,

212
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,080
little bits of paper or "chads" might
not have punched all the way through,

213
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,760
leading to images like this
and non-stop news coverage like this.

214
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,720
- Gore's hopes hang by a chad.
- Dimpled chads.

215
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,760
- Dangling chads.
- Hanging chads.

216
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,080
- Indented chads.
- Lone chads.

217
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,720
- Another claim: chad build up.
- A pregnant chad.

218
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,600
The race comes down to the chads.

219
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,200
Much like the third elimination
in every season of "The Bachelorette",

220
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,000
it all came down to the Chads.

221
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,640
Chad G., you have
the eyes of a murderer.

222
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,880
Chad R., you're 5'8, so Chad R.,
I'm afraid you have to go.

223
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:00,080
America became nervous
about punch-card ballots

224
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,880
and in 2002, Congress passed
the Help America Vote Act,

225
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,000
offering states 3.9 billion dollars
to administer federal elections

226
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,960
and buy new voting equipment,
which sounds great !

227
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,360
The then-chair of the Election
Assistance Commission

228
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,000
realized
that there was a problem immediately.

229
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:26,520
I was forced to send 2.3 billion
to the 50 states to buy equipment

230
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,480
even though the equipment
was not ready to be bought.

231
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,160
- Why'd you do it ?
- We had to.

232
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,800
We begged: "Let us do the research
before we send the money."

233
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,200
And Congress said no.

234
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,280
The politicians knew
these machines wouldn't work.

235
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,200
The politicians don't care.
Washington believes

236
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,080
the machines can't be that bad,
because after all, it produced them.

237
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,640
So, if they won the race,
how bad can the machine be ?

238
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,440
"The machine can't be bad
because it produced me !"

239
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,680
That is some faulty logic.
It's like saying:

240
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,840
"Reverse cowgirl is the best position
because it gave us Abraham Lincoln."

241
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:06,960
It absolutely did. That's just a fact.
Correlation does not equal causation !

242
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,920
Reverse cowgirl does not
equal Abraham Lincoln,

243
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,520
unless you're one
of these two fuck machines.

244
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,080
He brought the log,
she brought the cabin.

245
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,560
That's a history fact
I'm not willing to argue about.

246
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,160
States rushed to buy electronic
voting machines

247
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,280
before they were ready
to be bought.

248
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,280
There were already
some red flags:

249
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,560
one machine in Iowa
had 300 ballots fed into it

250
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,360
and somehow produced
four million votes.

251
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,320
To meet the demand,

252
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,720
at least one company outsourced
production of the machines,

253
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,120
and quality controls were sometimes
close to nonexistent.

254
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,800
Many people do not know

255
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,960
that we made those voting
machines in the Philippines.

256
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,760
Vibar says he worked on thousands of
voting machines shipped to the US

257
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,120
with what he says was virtually
no testing done on them.

258
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,720
A fraction of the machines underwent
a so-called "vibration test".

259
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,920
And what was this
quality control test ?

260
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,680
They shake the machine.

261
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,600
Yeah, that's it. They tested
the machine by shaking it.

262
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,120
Weird ! The only time
you should ever shake a machine

263
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,160
is when you're voting for Jill Stein,
in which case, that's how you do it.

264
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,960
You walk in, you shake
the machine and you leave.

265
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,840
The machine will totally
record your vote for Jill Stein,

266
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,040
just like you
and I both want it to.

267
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,040
That clip is actually from 2007,

268
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,840
but a shocking number of machines
bought back then are still in use.

269
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,560
Aging machines can be a problem.
Some counties have found

270
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,280
that the glue holding the touchscreen
can degrade, meaning that,

271
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,000
the screen can slip out of place
and register votes incorrectly.

272
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,200
The danger isn't just machines
going wrong by accident.

273
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,480
There is the threat of someone
gaining control of them.

274
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,720
Voting machines are technically
computers and computers are hackable.

275
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,480
It can be far easier to control
a machine than you might expect,

276
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,440
as this hacker demonstrates on
a model used in at least 18 states.

277
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,120
All they have to do,
this bad actor,

278
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,840
would be to open up this machine
by pressing this button right here

279
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,480
when it's off,
removing the card reader.

280
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,960
You don't need
any tools to do this.

281
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,960
Unplugging this, again, you
don't need any tools to do this.

282
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,120
Turning it on.

283
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,280
All you have to do is pick this lock
with a ballpoint pen.

284
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,120
Open this up,
press the red button

285
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,240
and we're gonna
let it boot up here.

286
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,280
Just click "Cancel" and "OK".

287
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,720
Now I have full admin access.
Under two minutes.

288
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,200
Holy shit ! That should have been
a lot more been more difficult.

289
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,440
You want hacking
into a voting machine

290
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,720
to be at least as difficult
as breaking into Fort Knox.

291
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,000
Which, incidentally,
is really hard.

292
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,400
You need to build a big giant
wooden horse,

293
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,680
you roll it up to the gates and
wait for all the guards to say:

294
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,240
"That's a fucking A-plus
horse right there."

295
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,320
"Let's put that inside our fort
where the gold lives."

296
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,320
While they're distracted,
sneak in and steal the gold.

297
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,320
It takes a lot of work,
but trust me:

298
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,960
it makes you value
the gold much more.

299
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,520
Hackers find vulnerabilities
in voting machines all the time.

300
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,000
We've not always been
great at responding.

301
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,520
A Finnish man, Harri Hursti,
once found

302
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,280
"one of the most severe security flaws
ever discovered in a voting system,"

303
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,040
and he alerted the company
who made the machine.

304
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,520
They created a patch to fix
the vulnerability, which is good.

305
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,320
While they put
the patch out in 2006,

306
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,520
we know the state of Georgia
never installed it.

307
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,280
A court case found their machines
had not been updated since 2005.

308
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,680
They'd been hitting
the "Remind Me Tomorrow" button

309
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,560
on a critical security update
for over a decade.

310
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,360
Georgia's election systems operate
at the same level

311
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,960
of technical proficiency
as every dad.

312
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,120
His laptop weighs 21 pounds,

313
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,320
he has a Yahoo mail address that he
can't open 'cause it only receives porn

314
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,800
and he has a Hotmail address
he can't open

315
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,560
because it only sends porn
to his Yahoo address.

316
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,880
His life is a beautiful mystery.

317
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,480
Voting-machine companies
and election officials will tell you

318
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,000
that hacks like that one take
place in very controlled settings

319
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,760
and that it would be difficult
in a booth without people noticing.

320
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,160
It is not always as difficult
to get some alone time with a machine

321
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,440
as you might think.

322
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,200
Professor Ed Felten of Princeton

323
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,640
performs an exercise every
Election Day.

324
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,680
He drives around Princeton to various
polling locations and he follows

325
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,680
the prominent signs that say
"Voting Here" days before the election

326
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,200
and then he takes photographs
of unattended voting machines.

327
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,160
That's for him to document that
anybody can walk up to these machines

328
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,360
and anybody can manipulate
them and nobody will know.

329
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,040
I've now shown you how to hack voting
machines in less than two minutes

330
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,920
and how to find
unattended voting machines.

331
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,320
It's the kind of important educational
work we do here

332
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,000
at "I Really Hope Putin Doesn't Watch
This Show with John Oliver."

333
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:29,640
You don't have to have hands-on
contact with a machine to hack it.

334
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,520
If it's connected to the internet,
you can get into it from anywhere.

335
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,040
Although, on that front,

336
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,640
many election officials insist
you have nothing to worry about.

337
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,440
Our machines are not connected
to the internet.

338
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,280
And they're not gonna be.

339
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,320
No state is on the internet.

340
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,480
It's difficult to hack something
not on the internet.

341
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,640
Our voting systems are never
connected to the internet.

342
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,600
Okay, so first,
let's deal with this.

343
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:06,360
I am aware that that man is a lot.
His name is Stan Stanart

344
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:12,080
and he's not
a Zach Galifianakis character.

345
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,800
He's a real human
and was the clerk

346
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,520
for the largest county
of Texas until last year.

347
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,600
This was his official photo,
and come on.

348
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,720
There is nothing I don't
like about that picture

349
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,000
besides the fact that it simply
hasn't winked at me yet.

350
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,040
Stan !
Right back atcha, Stanart the Man-art.

351
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,480
For a guy so sure his voting systems
are not connected to the internet,

352
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,560
watch what happens when a reporter
asks a very basic follow-up.

353
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,600
Are the machines
connected to the internet ?

354
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,720
Never.

355
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,000
- Is it ever connected to a modem ?
- Nope.

356
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:58,360
It is a secure modem where we dial
to an old-fashioned landline

357
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,800
to the one
of our four drop-off sites.

358
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:07,120
But that's the internet, Stan !
You just described the internet !

359
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,880
It's like he said:
"I've never eaten a banana split !"

360
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,960
only for the reporter to ask: "Then
what are you eating right now, Stan ?"

361
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,080
Why, it's just bananas
and ice cream topped with fudge !

362
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,600
I call it a Fruity Fantasm...
Why ?

363
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,720
Some machines that officials insist
don't connect to the internet

364
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,400
do connect to the internet.

365
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,680
Some machines that don't
connect directly to the internet

366
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,800
are programmed with cards
that have been programmed

367
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,240
on computers
that connect to the internet.

368
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,880
Your machine
isn't connected to the internet

369
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,560
the same way Alexa isn't recording
everything

370
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,840
and sending it directly
to Jeff Bezos.

371
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,320
It's not doing that, except for when
it's totally sometimes doing that.

372
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,880
Every voting machine can be tampered
with, in some way or other.

373
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,680
If I may quote an extremely
upbeat axe murderer:

374
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,120
"Pretty much everything
is hackable."

375
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:06,480
The solution isn't to make unhackable
machines, that's impossible.

376
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,720
We should be making them
as secure as we possibly can,

377
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,840
while also creating systems
so that we know for sure

378
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,600
when a problem has occurred,
which is an issue.

379
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,080
There is good reason to believe
that at least one individual

380
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,400
might exploit the vulnerabilities
in our current system.

381
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:27,600
Is Russia, as Robert Mueller alleged,

382
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,120
attempting to influence
the 2020 elections in the US ?

383
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,720
I'm going to tell you a secret.
Yes, sure, we're going to do that.

384
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:47,000
Yeah, this is...
Don't tell anybody.

385
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,640
Listen to that laughter in that room.
Putin is killing.

386
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,600
And not just in the normal
his political rivals way !

387
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,520
There is actually a consensus
on what we should do.

388
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,480
After each election, we do
what's called a risk-limiting audit,

389
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,720
where we take a small
percentage of the paper ballots

390
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,040
and make sure that they match
what the machines recorded.

391
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,160
Unfortunately, most places
don't currently do them.

392
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,480
Some actually can't, because
they use the machines

393
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,320
that we mentioned earlier, where
you vote directly on the machine

394
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,680
and there is no paper trail at all.

395
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,440
They are called direct-recording
electronic voting machines, or DREs.

396
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,200
They are very bad. If something
goes wrong with one of them,

397
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,280
you would basically never know,
because you can't audit the results.

398
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,760
And things have gone wrong.
In one local New Jersey election,

399
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,720
a husband and wife were running
for seats on their county's committee.

400
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,880
The DRE machines
said that they lost,

401
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,320
but they were in the unusual position
of knowing that that was a mistake.

402
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,360
I knew 33 of the people that voted
for us and we lost 33 to 10.

403
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,280
I knew that that wasn't the case.

404
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,000
The results had been switched
with those of their opponents.

405
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,600
We started calling people that we
thought we knew voted for us

406
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,600
because it was in this district
of this township

407
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,240
and we know
everybody in this district.

408
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,960
It's true. That woman went around
and got signed affidavits from people

409
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,000
saying they had voted for her.

410
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,600
Which means one of two things:
the machines switched the votes

411
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,840
or people will sign anything to
avoid a face-to-face confrontation.

412
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,520
Hi, Cynthia.
Yeah, sorry about that election.

413
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,320
I was really sad because
I totally voted for you.

414
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,840
You want me to affirm that statement
under penalty of perjury ?

415
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,240
That sounds better
than having this conversation, so fine.

416
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,760
I will sign anything to get you
off my fucking porch, Cynthia.

417
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,160
Unless you happen to personally know
everyone who votes for you

418
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,000
on a paperless DRE machine,
there is no way to verify the result.

419
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,840
It's a good case against them,
which makes it insane

420
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,440
that New Jersey
not only still uses them,

421
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,360
but plans to keep using them
for the 2020 election.

422
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,240
And it's not just New Jersey.
In 2016, 20 percent of voters

423
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,520
voted on paperless DREs.

424
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,240
An estimated 12 percent
will use them in 2020.

425
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,800
16 million Americans,
spread out across all these states,

426
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,400
are set to be voting on machines
that everyone agrees are flawed

427
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,720
and if they malfunction, there
could be no way of knowing.

428
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:37,200
Which is terrifying.
What we have to do here is obvious.

429
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,400
It's so obvious, in fact,
even this guy understands it.

430
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,040
One of the things we're learning,
is it's always good, it's oldfashioned,

431
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,040
but it's always good to have
a paper backup system of voting.

432
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,520
It's called paper,
not highly complex computers.

433
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,840
A lot of states are doing that.

434
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:04,000
Yeah, he's right. That's it.
He's all the way, completely right.

435
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:10,200
It is called paper.
Paper is not a computer, it's paper.

436
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,720
And a lot of states are doing it.

437
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,640
I'm sure everything he said
around those 16 seconds

438
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,520
was some combination
of wrong, racist, and horny,

439
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,160
but for a brief, glorious moment,
he was just absolutely right.

440
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:27,160
And probably slightly horny.
Earlier this year,

441
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,120
the House approved $600 million
for states to buy new machines,

442
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,200
with the requirement
they not connect to the internet

443
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,600
and provide a paper trail
for mandatory audits.

444
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,520
Senate has got its own plan,
providing less than half that amount,

445
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:47,320
with none of those requirements
at all, which is ridiculous.

446
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,840
We can fix this
and we must fix this.

447
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,600
It is important for people to have
confidence in our voting machines

448
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,400
and we should have more faith in our
system for choosing our leaders

449
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,720
than we do in the one that
inexplicably keeps Sean Spicer

450
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,520
doing the cha-cha
on national television.

451
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,400
And now this.

452
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:15,440
Our Look At What Happens When Local
News And Halloween Collide.

453
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,320
Halloween...

454
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,040
A good day
on "Coastal Living".

455
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,320
Batman, thank you
for having us here.

456
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,600
My strapless bra
is at my bellybutton right now.

457
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,440
What are we supposed to do ?

458
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,840
Dana found this in the newsroom,
which I thought was fitting

459
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,720
since this is what I get called
on a regular basis.

460
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,560
Happy Halloween !

461
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,680
Happy Halloween and we were
blessed with some snow this morning !

462
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,040
What we're seeing out there for
today's fire danger, it's lower.

463
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,000
It takes extra effort to fight
through the puddles

464
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,400
and the spray coming off
the vehicles on the interstate.

465
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,640
There was another spot
where we have one crash, on 275.

466
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,040
It's so cold out there.

467
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,160
- No.
- Yes.

468
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,240
That's our show.
See you next week. Goodnight !

469
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,640
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

470
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,440
END OF EPISODE 28,
SEASON VI
