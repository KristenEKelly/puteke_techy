LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,520
SEASON VI
EPISODE 22

3
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,560
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !

4
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,560
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,960
A quick recap of the week.
It was a busy one for the president,

6
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,640
who spent seemingly the entire week
desperately trying to prove

7
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,600
that he was in the right
when he claimed that last Sunday,

8
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,880
Alabama was among the states most
likely to be hit by Hurricane Dorian,

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,160
an effort that involved more than
10 tweets and this incredible moment.

10
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,920
President Trump showed off
this old map of Dorian's forecast path,

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,080
insisting he was right when he warned
Alabama was in the danger zone.

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,120
But tonight,
that map is raising new questions.

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,600
The black line projecting that Dorian
would move from Florida into Alabama

14
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,840
appears to be drawn on
by a marker.

15
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,080
This is what the president said...

16
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,360
That map it looked
like it almost had a Sharpie.

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,760
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,840
Really ? You don't know ?
Are you sure about that ?

19
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,720
You don't think
that you might've done it ?

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,960
For someone who lies so constantly,
it's astounding how bad he is at it.

21
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,760
There is a non zero chance that,
if he loses every state next year,

22
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,520
he'll claim he's won by standing
next to a fully-blue map

23
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,920
with the word "red" written on it, with
Sharpie stains on his fingers, saying:

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,680
"How did this happen ? I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know."

25
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,320
The "Washington Post"
talked to a White House official

26
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,560
who confirmed
it was Trump who did it, saying:

27
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,160
"No one else writes like that
on a map with a black Sharpie."

28
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,960
And of course they don't.

29
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,520
Trump is notorious for using Sharpies
to fix things he doesn't like.

30
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,000
In fact, years ago,

31
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,600
one of our writers wrote a blog post
about him for "Vanity Fair",

32
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,240
and he printed it out
and sent it to her boss like this,

33
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,480
with notes all over it,

34
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,760
including annotating the photo of him
with "Bad Picture (No Surprise),"

35
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,960
and this is my favorite part,

36
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,040
circling her name and writing
next to it "Bad Writer !"

37
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,040
To be fair to him: I've been saying
the same thing to her for six years.

38
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,240
But I don't do it in Sharpie !

39
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,160
I do it by ruthlessly demanding
endless rewrites

40
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,120
and being generally
withholding of praise.

41
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,600
Like a professional.

42
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,760
But instead of getting sucked
into that wormhole,

43
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,480
let's turn to the UK,
and their prime minister Boris Johnson.

44
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,200
If you want to make one at home, the
recipe is simply "Boil one (1) clown".

45
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
It was a chaotic week for Boris.

46
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,920
The deadline for Britain to leave
the E.U. is less than 8 weeks away.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
His tactic in trying to secure a better
deal is to threaten a "no-deal Brexit",

48
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,080
which could destabilize Europe
and seriously damage the UK.

49
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,120
Parliament stepped in this week,

50
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,800
holding a sequence of votes
to prevent that from happening.

51
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,160
Boris's first major defeat
came on Tuesday,

52
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,080
and if you listen closely
after the vote tally is announced,

53
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,000
one MP pretty accurately
summed the situation up.

54
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,600
The ayes to the right. 328.

55
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,520
The noes to the left, 301.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,400
Not a good start, Boris.

57
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,400
Here's the thing,
that's actually savage.

58
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,240
You have to understand
to a British sensibility,

59
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,880
"Not a good start, Boris"
is pretty much tantamount to,

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,240
"You really shit the bed,
sun-bleached photo-realistic Shrek."

61
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,240
And that defeat was just part
of a day of absolute mayhem.

62
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,960
Johnson lost
his parliamentary majority

63
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,480
when one of his MP's
defected to the Liberal Democrats

64
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,920
by physically moving across the aisle
while he was speaking.

65
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,640
One of his lieutenants was criticized
for sitting like this during a debate,

66
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,160
in a position that can be described
as "waiting to be fed grapes".

67
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,200
It's the look you'd expect for someone
who just masturbated in a hammock.

68
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,880
He looks like he's posing
for the cover of "Inbred Quarterly".

69
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,160
Things were chaotic, an amendment
seemed to pass by accident.

70
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,560
A lot of things
can happen by accident,

71
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,080
but changes to legislation
should frankly not be one of them.

72
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,640
It's like realizing

73
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,120
you shaved Henry Winkler's face
into the fur of a moose.

74
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,720
What the fuck
was happening in your life

75
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,240
that that could happen
inadvertently ?

76
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,720
It starts to make sense

77
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,040
when you realize how rowdy
the atmosphere in Parliament was,

78
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,880
with the speaker
rebuking a member like this.

79
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,360
Order.
Very rude, the members, order.

80
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,040
Order. Order, order, I say
to the chancellor of the duchy

81
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,440
that when he turns up
at our children's school as a parent,

82
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,640
he's a very well-behaved fellow.

83
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,440
Don't gesticulate, don't rant,
spare us the theatrics,

84
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,760
behave yourself,
be a good boy, young man.

85
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,440
Be a good boy !

86
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,000
Wait. "Be a good boy" ?

87
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,200
If he's gonna speak to a British
lawmaker like he's talking to a dog,

88
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,960
I hope he speaks to dogs
like he's addressing British lawmakers.

89
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,040
"Would the right honorable gentleman,
Mr. Waggles,"

90
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,320
"please finish
licking his ballsack ?"

91
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,400
"It's time for him
to take a shit on the pavement."

92
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,520
"Order ! Order ! Very rude."

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,360
Incidentally, as you may know,
the UK has a stupid law

94
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,080
prohibiting the use of parliamentary
footage in comedy shows.

95
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,520
Whenever we use it on this show,
we have to swap it out for them

96
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,920
with something else,
with zero explanation.

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,200
So, they'll be getting three clips
from this Irish Catholic sex-ed film

98
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,520
from the 1980s instead.

99
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,400
It's amazing how God made it,

100
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,920
because while they're making love
and being happy together,

101
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,160
the woman feels her vagina
becoming kind of slippery inside,

102
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
so that the penis can easily
slip in and out, no trouble.

103
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,080
I know. It's hot, right ?

104
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,080
It's genuinely difficult to decide
which part of that is the most sexy:

105
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,360
the reference to God,
the uninterrupted eye contact,

106
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,480
or the absolute dream of hearing
her say the word "slippery."

107
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,880
It all works for me.
It's all good for me.

108
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,800
And we're still just scratching
the surface of Boris's week.

109
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,800
Because with his own party
in open rebellion,

110
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,760
he took revenge
by expelling 21 of his own MPs,

111
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,520
one of whom
was Winston Churchill's grandson.

112
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,320
And that wasn't all-more members
then resigned in protest,

113
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,040
even this guy,
who is Boris's own brother.

114
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,000
Jo Johnson
must be the first minister

115
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,800
to resign to spend less time
with his family.

116
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,320
Jo Johnson tweeted:

117
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,600
"I've been torn between family loyalty
and the national interest"

118
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,560
"it's an unresolvable tension & time
for others,"

119
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,000
"to take on my roles
as MP & Minister."

120
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,800
"Hashtag #overandout."

121
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,560
Holy shit !

122
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,160
I don't know what's worse:
betraying your prime minister brother

123
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,360
because you think supporting him
might be against the national interest

124
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,080
or doing it with a hashtag.

125
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,320
I'm not saying I'm against hashtags.
I'm just saying "over-and-out" is lazy,

126
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,840
when he had so many better options
at his disposal.

127
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,400
How about:
#BoJosBroBroJoJoSaysNoMo ?

128
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,160
Or #BoJoToJoJoOhNoSayItAintSoSo ?

129
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,480
Or #CitingFomoJoJoGoesNomoBoJo ?

130
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,040
Or just #HotterBrother
WiselyAbandonsSloppyIdiot.

131
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,000
But wait,
'cause it gets one step crazier !

132
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,320
While Parliament has passed that bill
forcing Boris

133
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,360
to ask the EU for a Brexit delay
if a deal can't be reached,

134
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,280
he's indicated he may ignore that,

135
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,840
which could trigger
a legal and constitutional crisis.

136
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,640
And with the Brexit
deadline at the end of next month,

137
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,880
Boris now wants an election.

138
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,240
And if he can't get Parliament
to give him one on his terms,

139
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,160
he may, and this is true,
call a no-confidence vote in himself.

140
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,760
It was a week so absurd,

141
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,640
I think this commentator
may've summed it up best.

142
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,880
Nobody alive has lived
through this kind of collapse

143
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,800
of the way that governments operate.

144
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,800
I still think we're gonna see
a general election

145
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,920
but, you know, I can't be
a hundred percent certain of that

146
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,880
as I can hardly be certain
about anything in politics.

147
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,960
I just, to reiterate, chaos.

148
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,520
Look... English me is right.

149
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,200
He missed the memo
about losing the bangs, but he's right.

150
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,680
We are no closer to a safe Brexit
resolution than we were 3 years ago,

151
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,240
there's discord in Boris's party,
the wrong Johnson resigned.

152
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,520
Boris is about to suspend Parliament.
No one knows what's gonna happen.

153
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,040
All of which is really just a long way
of saying: not a good start, Boris !

154
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,440
And now, this !

155
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,320
And Now: Fox Business's Stu Varney
Gets All Giddy Over The President.

156
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,000
America will never be
a socialist country.

157
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,880
Don't you love it ? I stood up
and cheered for that one.

158
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,840
Well said, Mr. President.
That's telling them !

159
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,880
Tell us how it is, Mr. President.

160
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,320
He's back.
And he hasn't changed a bit.

161
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,240
Your dad,
the president of the United States,

162
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,240
tweets me occasionally
using my name.

163
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,320
Is he gonna keep doing that ?

164
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,200
I'm sorry if I got it wrong.

165
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,920
As you say in your tweet,
the wall is being built now.

166
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,120
Thank you for calling me out.

167
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,720
We're glad you are watching.
Thank you, Mr. President.

168
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,120
If you're watching,
you'll like this.

169
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,320
Makes me feel real good !
I'm an immigrant, for heaven's sake.

170
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,080
The President of the USA
quoted by him.

171
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,120
- You're blushing.
- Yes.

172
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,760
Deep breaths !

173
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
I love Stuart !

174
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,840
- Happy Friday to you, Stuart !
- An extraordinary day.

175
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,360
President Trump
just walked into the room.

176
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,960
I stood up, shook hands,
and he's with us right now.

177
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,280
- Thanks for being with us.
- It's only because I like your show.

178
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,840
- Thank you very much indeed, sir.
- We love having you.

179
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,840
- Thank you very much, indeed.
- Thank you very much.

180
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,160
There will be more Varney
after this.

181
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,840
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns legislation.

182
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,200
This guy from "Schoolhouse Rock !"

183
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,960
Bill. His last name is "Cosby".
You can see why he dropped it.

184
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,040
Anyway: in the lead-up
to the democratic primaries,

185
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,920
we've heard a lot of big promises

186
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,120
about the fabulous bills candidates
will sign when they're elected.

187
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,520
The best way to go forward

188
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,240
is through a Medicare for All,
single payer program.

189
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,240
I have a proposal to build
about 3 million new housing units.

190
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,640
My big idea is a freedom
dividend of $1,000 a month

191
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,240
for every American adult
starting at age 18.

192
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,720
My big idea is baby bonds.

193
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,280
We need to have our transportation
system run on electricity.

194
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,800
I'm gonna make sure that happens.

195
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,480
No, Jay Inslee,
you're not gonna make that happen,

196
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,800
primarily 'cause you dropped
out of the race two weeks ago.

197
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,320
Possibly because your campaign tactic
of "drive-by scooter-shouting"

198
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,640
was, at best,
a little ahead of its time.

199
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,480
As appealing
as many of those ideas sound,

200
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,760
none are likely to happen,
even if a Democrat wins,

201
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,240
because they'd have
to go through the Senate.

202
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,760
And the Senate-it's the country's
second most influential body,

203
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,920
after Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's.

204
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,880
Ladies and gentlemen,
that man is five years older than me.

205
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,640
Whatever you're thinking now,
I know.

206
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,840
The modern Senate
is a giant non-functioning roadblock,

207
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,000
as any senator on their way out
will tell you.

208
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,080
The Senate
as an institution is in crisis.

209
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,680
The people's business
is not getting done.

210
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,720
We're getting nothing done my friends;
we're getting nothing done !

211
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,480
The United States Senate is no longer
the world's greatest deliberative body

212
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,920
and everybody
needs to quit saying it.

213
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,080
Senators regularly do the thing
that most people can only dream of:

214
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,600
leave their jobs, while telling
off everyone they worked with.

215
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,840
"This is no longer the town's
greatest Jamba Juice"

216
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,480
"and everyone
needs to quit saying it !"

217
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,480
You're making bad juice, my friends,
you're making bad juice !

218
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,080
The Senate doesn't pass
many major laws these days.

219
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,400
You could argue the last major
social program passed into law

220
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,560
was Obamacare, a decade ago.

221
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,560
That low level of production

222
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,640
is largely thanks to one incredibly
annoying legislative tool.

223
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,320
Not actually this tool.
Although he is certainly at fault.

224
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,520
I'm referring to the filibuster.

225
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,200
So, that is what we're actually
going to look at tonight.

226
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,120
Or, if you're watching this
on YouTube: this morning.

227
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,160
Or, if you reached for the remote the
moment I said the word "filibuster":

228
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,440
goodbye,
and I completely understand !

229
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,960
A filibuster is any tactic
aimed at blocking a measure

230
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,840
by preventing it
from coming to a vote.

231
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,160
The word "filibuster" is derived
from the Dutch word for "freebooter",

232
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,200
which basically means "pirate".

233
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
And I didn't even know
there were Dutch pirates,

234
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,920
but I'd absolutely
watch a movie about them.

235
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,400
And remember:
"dead men tell no talesh !"

236
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,280
If you are at all
aware of the filibuster,

237
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,640
you know it as "that thing where
a senator stands and talks endlessly."

238
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,880
It's often been presented in TV
and movies as a heroic act,

239
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,600
like when Jimmy Stewart
talked himself to exhaustion

240
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,120
in "Mr. Smith Goes To Washington".

241
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,680
I'm gonna stay right here
and fight for this lost cause,

242
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,800
even if this room gets filled
with lies like these;

243
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,640
and the Taylors and all their armies
come marching into this place.

244
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,240
Somebody'll listen to me.

245
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,280
He was a bad actor.

246
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,880
They were all pretty bad back then
but he was especially bad.

247
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,800
The thing is that movie made
the filibuster seem like a good idea.

248
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,880
Just like how "The Wizard of Oz"
made going on a trip with a furry,

249
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,000
a vagrant, and an axe-wielding robot
seem like a good idea.

250
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,680
But in real life:
it's only a good idea if you know them.

251
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,840
But the modern filibuster is nothing
like the Jimmy Stewart version.

252
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,000
It's become
an overused tool of obstruction,

253
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,400
and it essentially means
that a simple majority of 51 votes

254
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,360
isn't nearly enough
to pass legislation.

255
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,280
If you don't get 60 votes for a bill,
it's dead.

256
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,080
Which means theoretically, senators
from the 21 least populated states,

257
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,600
representing just 11% of Americans,
could overrule everyone else.

258
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,840
Which seems pretty extreme.
To quote everyone

259
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,240
who's sat in a bathroom stall
with a 3-inch gap in the door:

260
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,320
why on earth
was it designed this way ?

261
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,560
People often claim that it goes back
to the founding of the country.

262
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,480
An argument that runs like this.

263
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,360
You may wonder why
the Senate has this 60-vote rule,

264
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,040
when it's a straight majority rule
in the House.

265
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,760
The answer is that the founders
meant it that way.

266
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,120
The Senate was designed
to be the "cooling saucer"

267
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,480
where the two parties
were forced to work together

268
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,680
and hence that 60-vote threshold.

269
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,680
A few things about that.
The first thing is that it is not true.

270
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,280
Nothing about a 60-vote threshold
for legislation in the Constitution,

271
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,760
in the Federalist Papers,
in Jefferson's private letters,

272
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,600
nothing skillfully
rapped by Alexander Hamilton

273
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,080
to the delight
of everyone within earshot.

274
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,440
Some historians say the filibuster
was created by mistake.

275
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,960
The first one didn't take place
until 1837.

276
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,000
So, it was categorically not
part of the founders' original vision.

277
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,320
Like claiming the day Graham Bell
invented the telephone,

278
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,160
he also sent the first dick pic.

279
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,440
No. He didn't. That development
came much later. Two weeks later.

280
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,960
She is right about that
whole "cooling saucer" idea.

281
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,520
That's a story that comes up
constantly, and it goes like this.

282
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,560
The Senate was created to be
a cooling saucer

283
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,360
to the hot legislation
that comes from the House.

284
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,160
It is the cooling saucer,
we all know the story.

285
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,200
The old metaphor
Washington used:

286
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,040
the House is the cup of coffee.

287
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,480
The Senate is the saucer
that you pour the coffee into,

288
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,040
so it can cool
the passions of the House.

289
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,200
First, never say "cool" like that
ever again, ever.

290
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,120
Setting aside the argument that
the Senate should be more deliberative,

291
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,920
you might be wondering: why would
someone pour coffee into a saucer ?

292
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,440
In the 18th century,
people did exactly that.

293
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,720
They would pour coffee
out of their cup, into a saucer

294
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,040
to let it cool, and then drink it
directly from that.

295
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,440
Ridiculous and something
I wish I'd never learned.

296
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,800
Thomas Jefferson seems like
a towering historical figure

297
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,000
until you imagine him
sipping out of a saucer like a cat.

298
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:58,240
The founders wanted the Senate
to be a counterweight to the House.

299
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,760
They achieved that by having fewer
members who serve longer terms,

300
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,400
six years, not two,

301
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,800
and, until 1913, not having them
directly elected by the people.

302
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,600
If keeping the filibuster is not
following the founders' wishes,

303
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,040
why do we still have it ?

304
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,400
Some argue it preserves the Senate's
ability to be a bastion of debate,

305
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,040
as this senator explained in 1952.

306
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,320
The Senate of the US is the last
open forum in the world

307
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:31,240
where the rights of minorities can be
fully, freely and completely debated.

308
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,760
While I would never and have never
taken part in a filibuster,

309
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,680
neither would I take part in an effort
which would result

310
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,680
in depriving any minority group
from having their cause fully discussed

311
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,440
and fully debated on the floor
of the US Senate.

312
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:55,640
The Senate's reputation as a haven
of gentlemanly debate is overblown.

313
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,000
In the 1800s, senators
pulled pistols on each other,

314
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,240
and at one point, a congressman
used a metal-topped cane

315
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,040
to beat Senator Charles Sumner
nearly to death.

316
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,480
Feeling nostalgic for the golden age
of the Senate is like feeling nostalgic

317
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,200
for 90's indie films, then
actually watching "Chasing Amy".

318
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,520
Set aside the notion that any lesbian
can be magically turned straight

319
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,320
if the right guy comes along.

320
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,800
What's extra-offensive is the idea that
that guy would be Ben Affleck.

321
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,800
That guy touched on another major
argument for the filibuster, there:

322
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,000
that it protects minority rights.

323
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,560
The minority whose rights have
been protected by the filibuster

324
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,280
are the political minority

325
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,040
who've used it restrict
the rights of racial minorities.

326
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,560
The Senate's
website calls the filibuster

327
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,720
"useful to southern senators
to block civil rights legislation"

328
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,800
and it was used most notably
by Senator Strom Thurmond.

329
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,520
Watch him announce his plans

330
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,160
to try and kill the Civil Rights Act
of 1964

331
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,640
by subjecting it
to endless debate.

332
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,840
It will be the aim of our small band
of southern senators

333
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:08,440
to make certain that every facet
of this legislation is discussed,

334
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,560
considered and expanded
at great length,

335
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,040
even indefinitely, if necessary.

336
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,200
Exactly.
He wanted to debate it indefinitely.

337
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,040
His goal wasn't to consider every
aspect, his goal was to kill it.

338
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,720
Like a five year-old saying:
"I shall pull the legs off this bug,"

339
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,680
"so that every facet may be discussed
and considered at great length."

340
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,600
No. That little psycho just
wants to watch a bug die.

341
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,960
Thurmond knew just how
obstructive a filibuster could be.

342
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,800
In 1957, he stalled
another civil rights bill

343
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,440
by speaking for a still-record
24 hours and 18 minutes straight,

344
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,040
while "he had his aide wait
in the cloakroom with a pail"

345
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,280
so he could relieve himself while still
keeping a foot on the Senate floor.

346
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,080
It's almost impressive to take
a morally disgusting act

347
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,960
and somehow make it
physically disgusting too.

348
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,000
It's like if Hitler delivered speeches
while publicly clipping his toenails.

349
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,040
Modern filibusters
no longer contain

350
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,920
the David-Blaine-esque-feat
of-endurance element.

351
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,080
In the seventies,
in the interests of efficiency,

352
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,240
senators agreed to no longer
require talking filibusters,

353
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,840
in the style of
"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"

354
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,680
or "Mr. Thurmond Goes
to the Bathroom in a Bucket."

355
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,280
If you just signal
your intent to filibuster

356
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,560
and have 41 votes on your side,
a bill is doomed.

357
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,320
Not to say that senators
don't sometimes choose

358
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,440
to stand and talk for hours,
it's just that when they do,

359
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,880
it's often a publicity stunt
or a protest.

360
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,520
Chris Murphy spoke for 15 hours
to draw attention to gun control.

361
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,760
Rand Paul filibustered Obama's
nominee for CIA director for 13 hours,

362
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,240
pausing only to eat fun-size candy
with spectacular incompetence.

363
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,080
Which had previously brought
a challenge in federal court

364
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,520
to the legality of the authorization
to target Awlaki in Yemen,

365
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,120
released
the following statement.

366
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:13,400
How are you eating
something so small that badly ?

367
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,640
It didn't even present the challenge
of a regular candy bar.

368
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,240
We've all gotten into the quagmire
of a normal-size Milky Way

369
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,880
and not been able to get out

370
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,240
until everything we know
and love is covered in caramel.

371
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,000
But that was fun-size !
It should've been easy !

372
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,160
At least Rand Paul stayed on topic,

373
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,240
unlike when Ted Cruz filibustered
against Obamacare.

374
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,960
Remember, the stated argument
for this tactic is:

375
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,960
it is supposed to be a vital means of
facilitating a full and robust debate.

376
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,160
I do not like green eggs and ham,
I do not like them, Sam I am.

377
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,960
Would you like them in a house ?
Would you like them with a mouse ?

378
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,200
I do not like them in a house.
I do not like them with a mouse.

379
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,280
Don't like them here or there,
Don't like them anywhere.

380
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,640
I do not like that man Ted Cruz.
I do not like his far-right views.

381
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,520
I do not like his stupid chin.
I do not like his smarmy grin.

382
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,640
I do not like him with a beard.
I do not like him freshly-sheared.

383
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,520
I do not like Ted Cruz at all,
That man Ted Cruz can suck my balls.

384
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:27,520
But, again: Cruz and Paul
didn't need to do that.

385
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,720
When you combine the fact
that it's easier to filibuster

386
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,760
with the increasingly partisan
nature of the Senate,

387
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,520
it's no surprise that its usage
has skyrocketed.

388
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,480
If you look at the number
of cloture votes,

389
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,720
the number during Eisenhower's
term, here, was two.

390
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,080
Whereas in Obama's eight years,
here, there were 506.

391
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,400
Which kind of undercuts the final
argument in favor of the filibuster:

392
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,640
that it encourages bipartisanship.

393
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,840
That if you have to get 60 votes
to end debate on a bill,

394
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,400
the parties will just
have to work together.

395
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,520
But the reality there is:
that is simply not happening.

396
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,440
Thanks to the filibuster,
many pieces of meaningful legislation,

397
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,840
some with bipartisan support,
have died,

398
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,800
from the Manchin-Toomey gun control
bill to the Paycheck Fairness Act

399
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,960
to the public option in Obamacare.

400
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,480
Senators don't so much brag
about what they've passed

401
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,200
as brag about
what they are going to obstruct.

402
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,880
Watch Mitch McConnell promising
that the Green New Deal

403
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,760
and Medicare for All won't see a vote
if they ever end up in his chamber.

404
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,920
None of those things
are gonna pass the Senate.

405
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:39,080
They won't even be voted on.
Think of me as the Grim Reaper:

406
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,400
the guy who's gonna
make sure

407
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,520
that socialism doesn't land
on the president's desk.

408
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,880
You really don't have to tell me
to think of you as the grim reaper.

409
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,360
Like if Trump said:
"Think of me as a bunch of trash bags"

410
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,560
"brought to life by an ancient curse
when a clown fucked a car alarm."

411
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,160
I'm way ahead of you.
I already think of you that way.

412
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,200
To recap the main arguments
in favor of the filibuster:

413
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,160
"We've always had it", we haven't.
"It enables debate", no it doesn't.

414
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,880
"Protects minorities",
not the ones you think.

415
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,720
"It encourages bipartisanship",
not even close.

416
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,000
It has become
so difficult to pass a law,

417
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,920
the big issues are being handled by
other branches of the government.

418
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,560
Issues,
from immigration to climate change,

419
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,200
are being decided through
executive actions and court rulings.

420
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,800
So, why keep the filibuster ?
Some presidential candidates,

421
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,440
including Pete Buttigieg,
Steve Bullock and Elizabeth Warren,

422
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,760
want to get rid of it.

423
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,800
Before you get excited about
your favorite Democrats,

424
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,920
and also Steve Bullock,
calling for it to be abolished,

425
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,640
you should know... so has this guy.

426
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,280
We have to get rid of
what's called the filibuster rule.

427
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,480
We have to !

428
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:02,040
If we don't, the Republicans will
never get anything passed.

429
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,400
Exactly. Nothing can make you
question one of your beliefs

430
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,680
quite like Trump
unexpectedly sharing it.

431
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,440
There are endless opinions
that a person can have.

432
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,880
Inevitably, a few of them
will overlap with Donald Trump's.

433
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,280
He and I both enjoy a good hamberder.
We do.

434
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,120
We both think James Comey
is a big pasty goober. It's true !

435
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,640
Neither of us are willing to
Google Tiffany Trump's birthday.

436
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,920
We're not completely different.
But the fact that Trump is in favor

437
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,760
of ending the filibuster is a good
reminder of the serious risk here.

438
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,600
The side you agree
with won't always be in power.

439
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,720
Abolishing the filibuster would make it
easier for everyone to do things,

440
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,200
including people
you might not agree with.

441
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,720
There have been
hard lessons in this regard.

442
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,120
It used to be possible to filibuster
judicial nominations.

443
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,920
That was rolled back,
even for the Supreme Court,

444
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,880
and one consequence was last year's
50-to-48 confirmation

445
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,520
of Justice Sourpuss J. Boofs-A-Lot.

446
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,440
This is undeniably a gamble.
You may well feel that it's too risky.

447
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:11,440
I have come around to thinking
that it is a risk worth taking.

448
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,520
The Senate is supposed
to address America's problems

449
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,440
and the filibuster is making it
impossible for them to do that.

450
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,000
Some have suggested
merely reforming it,

451
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,440
maybe going back to forcing senators
to pay a physical price

452
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,440
and stand
and talk for hours again.

453
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,040
But as we have seen, some senators
are more than happy to do that,

454
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,720
even if they don't have to.

455
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,880
Do you really want to hear more

456
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,200
of Ted Cruz creepily reading you
bedtime stories ?

457
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,400
Or watch Rand Paul battle fun-sized
candy to a draw ? No, you don't.

458
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,320
So, that is why I'm arguing that
we should get rid of the filibuster.

459
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,560
What better way for me to do that

460
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,400
than with the exact kind
of big, stupid speech that I hate ?

461
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,040
So please, come with me,
as I filibuster the filibuster.

462
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,880
I'm not gonna talk for 15 hours.
It's completely unnecessary.

463
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,120
It sounds hard and we only
have a minute left of this show.

464
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,200
I'll just do the only parts
that anyone remembers anyway.

465
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,480
Here's the beginning part,
where I'm lucid and on-topic:

466
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,960
the filibuster has made the Senate
completely unable to perform its duties

467
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,360
and something has to be done,
my friends.

468
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,280
Something has to be done.

469
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,600
Let's jump to the fun part where
I somehow fail at eating junk food,

470
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,600
which is why I've brought this big
plastic candy cane full of M&Ms.

471
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,480
How is this so difficult ?

472
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,560
Don't help me,
I can do this on my own.

473
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,800
It's harder than it looks !

474
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,400
Let's cut straight to the part
where I make an important point

475
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,400
while also
urinating into a bucket.

476
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,320
That's better.

477
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,440
The point here is, the more
you learn about the filibuster,

478
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,920
the more it appears to be a historical
mistake that's not serving us well.

479
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,520
Hold on. Don't look at me.
Nobody look at me.

480
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,240
There she goes.

481
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,520
While it is good to give the minority
party a voice in the Senate,

482
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,600
it should not come at the cost
of getting anything done.

483
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:24,120
Let's jump forward 15 hours
to my final, exhausted point.

484
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,120
What I'm essentially saying:
requiring bills to have 60 votes

485
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,320
is like pouring coffee out
of a good cup into a saucer

486
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,360

like a cat.

487
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,120

488
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,480

489
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,760
"Does this make sense, or is it
incredibly fucking stupid ?"

490
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,640
That is our show. Thank you
for watching. See you next week.

00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,480
This is the part where my voice
gives out and I collapse. Good night !
