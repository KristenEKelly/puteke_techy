1
00:00:30,252 --> 00:00:33,851
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight"!

2
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:36,371
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

3
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:38,730
Just time for a quick recap
of the week,

4
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,490
which brought a series of setbacks
for President Trump,

5
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,370
voted world's sexiest man

6
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,289
by "Is This Enough to Make You
Go Away?" magazine.

7
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:47,889
Trump has had quite a week,

8
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:51,528
including a summit with Kim Jong-un
where he failed to get an agreement,

9
00:00:51,688 --> 00:00:53,608
despite them
standing shoulder-to-shoulder

10
00:00:53,768 --> 00:00:56,448
like brothers standing outside
a Marshall's changing room

11
00:00:56,608 --> 00:01:00,487
wearing back-to-school clothes
that they do not want Mom to buy.

12
00:01:00,647 --> 00:01:04,287
In the U.S., there was the congressional
testimony of Trump's former lawyer

13
00:01:04,446 --> 00:01:06,846
and longtime yell sponge
Michael Cohen,

14
00:01:07,006 --> 00:01:10,126
who gave us a glimpse
into what Trump was like as a boss.

15
00:01:10,286 --> 00:01:13,445
How many times
did Mr. Trump ask you

16
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:18,604
to threaten an individual
or entity on his behalf?

17
00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:20,164
Quite a few times.

18
00:01:20,324 --> 00:01:21,764
- 50 times?
- More.

19
00:01:21,924 --> 00:01:23,484
- 100 times?
- More.

20
00:01:23,644 --> 00:01:25,363
- 200 times?
- More.

21
00:01:25,523 --> 00:01:27,083
- 500 times?
- Probably.

22
00:01:27,243 --> 00:01:29,763
Wow.
That is a lot.

23
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:34,482
Although I'm kind of disappointed
he didn't issue 525,600 threats.

24
00:01:34,642 --> 00:01:36,562
I'd have loved to see
the cast of "Rent"

25
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:39,601
spontaneously appear and start
dancing in the background.

26
00:01:39,761 --> 00:01:43,241
Over the course of the hearing,
Cohen described several possible crimes

27
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:45,600
by his former boss,
from suborning perjury

28
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,720
to campaign finance violations,
and yet, the Republicans

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,839
primarily used their time
to attack Cohen's credibility,

30
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:55,439
not that he went out of his way
to dispute that characterization.

31
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,718
Mr. Cohen, you called Donald Trump
a cheat in your opening testimony.

32
00:02:00,878 --> 00:02:03,758
What would you call yourself?

33
00:02:03,918 --> 00:02:05,357
A fool.

34
00:02:05,517 --> 00:02:08,397
You calling--okay. Well...

35
00:02:08,557 --> 00:02:10,277
Yeah, okay.

36
00:02:10,437 --> 00:02:13,716
I mean, it is pretty hard to
argue with that now, isn't it?

37
00:02:13,876 --> 00:02:17,876
The fact that Michael Cohen now has
absolutely no respect for Michael Cohen

38
00:02:18,036 --> 00:02:21,755
is the first thing I've ever respected
about Michael Cohen.

39
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:24,595
But even that hearing didn't
last long in the headlines,

40
00:02:24,755 --> 00:02:26,674
thanks to Trump's
third fiasco of the week,

41
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:28,474
which centered around Jared Kushner,

42
00:02:28,634 --> 00:02:32,353
who'll be referred to as "Diminutive
Nothing Boy 1" in the Mueller report.

43
00:02:32,513 --> 00:02:35,793
Jared is currently right where
you'd expect a boy his age to be:

44
00:02:35,953 --> 00:02:37,513
trying to broker a peace deal

45
00:02:37,673 --> 00:02:40,792
in one of the most intractable conflicts
in recent history.

46
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,592
Jared's been promising an
Israeli-Palestinian peace deal

47
00:02:43,752 --> 00:02:46,471
for two years now and recently
promised to unveil it

48
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:48,711
"sometime after
the Israeli elections,"

49
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:51,551
which, as far as promises go,
isn't one.

50
00:02:51,711 --> 00:02:55,390
Although he actually got close
to almost discussing his plan this week

51
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,710
in a rare on-camera interview
with Sky News Arabia.

52
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,149
What we have found is that
all the conflict does

53
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:04,709
is keep the people
from having the opportunity

54
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:07,508
to do commerce
and improve their lives.

55
00:03:07,668 --> 00:03:10,948
Look, I don't know when that joke
is gonna stop being funny,

56
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:15,547
but it's not fucking now,
and it probably won't be the next time.

57
00:03:15,707 --> 00:03:21,066
But Jared's six-nation tour for peace
was complicated by a new revelation.

58
00:03:21,226 --> 00:03:23,466
<i>"The New York Times" reports</i>
<i>that Trump ordered</i>

59
00:03:23,626 --> 00:03:25,865
<i>his then-White House</i>
<i>chief of staff John Kelly</i>

60
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:28,705
<i>to give a top-secret security clearance</i>
<i>to Jared Kushner.</i>

61
00:03:28,865 --> 00:03:32,545
<i>The paper says Kelly and Don McGahn,</i>
<i>the White House counsel at the time,</i>

62
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:35,184
<i>wrote memos raising concerns</i>
<i>about the order.</i>

63
00:03:35,344 --> 00:03:39,144
The only surprising thing there
is the claim that Kelly and McGahn

64
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:41,543
bothered to write memos
raising concerns.

65
00:03:41,703 --> 00:03:45,903
The fuck is Trump supposed to do
with a memo raising concerns?

66
00:03:46,062 --> 00:03:47,702
Read it?
A memo?

67
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:49,422
With what?
His eyes?

68
00:03:49,582 --> 00:03:52,142
For what possible reason?
So he can know stuff?

69
00:03:52,302 --> 00:03:55,261
To what end?
So he can do stuff? Why?

70
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:59,980
So he can get more memos about the stuff
he's doing? Nice try, memos.

71
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,140
You have to wake up pretty early in
the morning to pull one over this guy.

72
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,140
Memos.

73
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,739
Now, one major issue with Jared having
access to state secrets

74
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:13,338
is, you know, it's Jared--

75
00:04:13,498 --> 00:04:15,258
a guy who, even among Jareds,

76
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:18,338
stands out as the Jared
of the group.

77
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:21,377
But the other major issue with his
top-secret clearance

78
00:04:21,537 --> 00:04:23,617
concerns national security.

79
00:04:23,777 --> 00:04:25,297
<i>A report in "The Washington Post"</i>

80
00:04:25,457 --> 00:04:27,856
<i>suggests officials</i>
<i>from China, Israel, Mexico,</i>

81
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:29,536
<i>and the United Arab Emirates</i>

82
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:34,455
<i>saw Kushner as exploitable and at one</i>
<i>point hoped to manipulate him.</i>

83
00:04:34,615 --> 00:04:36,535
Well, hold on.
Manipulate him?

84
00:04:36,695 --> 00:04:38,695
Jared?
This guy?

85
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:40,734
He'd sniff that out in a heartbeat.

86
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:44,534
Unless, of, course,
someone got his nose!

87
00:04:44,694 --> 00:04:47,733
Uh-oh!
How's Jared gonna get his nose back?

88
00:04:47,893 --> 00:04:50,853
Maybe he'd trade it for communications
of a foreign government

89
00:04:51,013 --> 00:04:53,572
extralegally intercepted
by U.S. military intelligence?

90
00:04:53,732 --> 00:04:55,732
How about that?
How about that, Jared?

91
00:04:55,892 --> 00:04:57,732
Okay, then, that's a deal.

92
00:04:57,892 --> 00:05:01,011
Now who's ready to detect
the slightest whiff of manipulation?

93
00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:03,131
Who's a good boy?

94
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,851
But I'd argue that there
are some very good reasons

95
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:07,850
not to give Jared
security clearance,

96
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,890
regardless of whether
he's easily tricked,

97
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,450
which he absolutely is,
because if he weren't,

98
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,129
I wouldn't have been
able to get his nose again!

99
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:17,729
Oh, what am I gonna do
with two noses?

100
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:20,129
Oh, well!

101
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:24,208
Because Jared
initially failed to disclose

102
00:05:24,368 --> 00:05:26,448
meetings with Russian agents
to the FBI

103
00:05:26,608 --> 00:05:28,607
and there've been concerns
over his dealings

104
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:30,487
with foreign businessmen
and officials.

105
00:05:30,647 --> 00:05:34,166
That's not even getting into
my biggest concern, his complexion.

106
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:37,806
That alone should be
instantly disqualifying.

107
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:40,526
How the fuck does he look
so well rested?

108
00:05:40,685 --> 00:05:44,125
This is a guy who's not just
brokering peace in the Middle East;

109
00:05:44,285 --> 00:05:47,085
he's tackling the opioid crisis
and national infrastructure

110
00:05:47,245 --> 00:05:49,284
as head of the Office
of American Innovation,

111
00:05:49,444 --> 00:05:51,804
while constantly traveling
halfway around the world

112
00:05:51,964 --> 00:05:55,523
and doing it all while navigating
the psychosexual Stalingrad

113
00:05:55,683 --> 00:05:58,323
that is marriage
to Donald Trump's daughter.

114
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,122
Where are the bags under his eyes?

115
00:06:01,282 --> 00:06:03,522
How is his skin so smooth?

116
00:06:03,682 --> 00:06:06,842
It is deeply worrisome
how unworried he looks.

117
00:06:07,002 --> 00:06:10,721
The only way you maintain that glow
with that to-do list

118
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:13,721
is by not really understanding
anything on it.

119
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:15,440
I mean, just look at this.

120
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,520
He's radiant
in every single photograph.

121
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,479
He has resting rested face.

122
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,959
Do you want to know
what the guy who helped broker

123
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:27,279
the 1993 Oslo peace accords
looked like?

124
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,158
It's a rhetorical question,
because you absolutely don't.

125
00:06:30,318 --> 00:06:33,878
This is former secretary of state
Warren Christopher.

126
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:37,077
Those are the jowls of a
deeply stressed-out individual,

127
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:39,077
stress that's entirely appropriate

128
00:06:39,237 --> 00:06:41,916
given the gravity
and complexity of his workload.

129
00:06:42,076 --> 00:06:43,916
Jared, on the other hand,

130
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:47,716
looks like a 17th-century portrait
of a Dutch teenager.

131
00:06:47,876 --> 00:06:50,875
Look, say what you will
about Henry Kissinger

132
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:54,395
and the Cambodian civilians whose
villages he bombed certainly can't--

133
00:06:54,555 --> 00:06:56,714
but the man looks
reassuringly terrible.

134
00:06:56,874 --> 00:07:02,313
And yet he's the exact same age
as Jared in that photo.

135
00:07:02,473 --> 00:07:06,073
One more reason this story could
be trouble for the Trump administration:

136
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:10,512
they've repeatedly denied on the record
that Jared got special treatment.

137
00:07:10,672 --> 00:07:14,352
When Trump was asked whether he pushed
Jared's clearance through, he said,

138
00:07:14,512 --> 00:07:17,951
"I wouldn't do it. I was never involved
with the security."

139
00:07:18,111 --> 00:07:21,351
And last month, this was how
Ivanka responded to questions.

140
00:07:21,511 --> 00:07:24,590
Many people question whether you
were given special treatment

141
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,110
by the president, over other...

142
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,590
- Absolutely not.
- Officials.

143
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,269
Can you speak to that?

144
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:33,109
There were anonymous leaks
about there being issues.

145
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:36,628
But the president had no involvement

146
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:39,588
pertaining to my clearance
or my husband's clearance.

147
00:07:39,748 --> 00:07:42,627
- What were the problems early on?
- There weren't any.

148
00:07:42,787 --> 00:07:46,507
Oh, please. I honestly don't know
what's sadder there.

149
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:49,186
Either Ivanka's knowingly lying
about her dad

150
00:07:49,346 --> 00:07:51,666
forcing her and Jared's
security clearance through

151
00:07:51,826 --> 00:07:55,266
or she genuinely thinks
they got it on merit on their own.

152
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:57,145
And if it is the latter, Ivanka,

153
00:07:57,305 --> 00:07:59,305
there are some things
you should know.

154
00:07:59,465 --> 00:08:02,784
You became executive vice president
of the Trump Organization at 24

155
00:08:02,944 --> 00:08:04,664
because you're
Donald Trump's daughter,

156
00:08:04,824 --> 00:08:07,224
not because you were
a 24-year-old business prodigy.

157
00:08:07,384 --> 00:08:09,783
You got a book deal because
you're Trump's daughter,

158
00:08:09,943 --> 00:08:12,343
not because you're a brilliant
author and wordsmith.

159
00:08:12,503 --> 00:08:14,863
And you only hosted
the Miss Teen USA pageant

160
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:16,902
because your dad owned the contest,

161
00:08:17,062 --> 00:08:19,702
not because of your
sparkling on-camera presence.

162
00:08:19,862 --> 00:08:21,462
And you know how Santa Claus

163
00:08:21,622 --> 00:08:24,301
used to visit on Christmas morning
to give you presents?

164
00:08:24,461 --> 00:08:27,381
Well, that wasn't the real Santa.
It was Michael Cohen.

165
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:31,580
And trust me, he won't be coming
down your chimney anymore.

166
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,100
And now this.

167
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,899
And now,
no one does local news beat poetry

168
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:42,419
quite like NBC 4 Washington's
Pat Collins.

169
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:45,778
Five burglaries here in six days.

170
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:47,778
Two on this street.

171
00:08:47,938 --> 00:08:49,297
Two on that street.

172
00:08:49,457 --> 00:08:52,777
One on a street
down around the corner.

173
00:08:52,937 --> 00:08:55,937
Glass doors broken.
Valuables taken.

174
00:08:56,096 --> 00:08:58,456
Credit cards, jewelry, cash.

175
00:08:58,616 --> 00:09:03,095
When Verizon shipped some cell phones
to some stores in our area,

176
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:07,055
they shipped the phones,
but the phones never arrived.

177
00:09:07,215 --> 00:09:10,974
Cops.
Cops want this guy really bad.

178
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:17,493
You see, he's been using CVS stores
as his own personal ATM.

179
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:19,573
Downed power lines.

180
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:21,693
Downed trees.

181
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,812
No way out of here.

182
00:09:23,972 --> 00:09:25,732
Tim-ber.

183
00:09:25,892 --> 00:09:27,292
Yikes.

184
00:09:27,452 --> 00:09:31,251
Motorcycle. Motorcycle.
Motorcycle.

185
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:33,491
She had a lot of money.

186
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:35,291
She had a passport.

187
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:36,890
And she had...

188
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,530
one of these.

189
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,770
Some of the phones
had been activated.

190
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,169
Some of the phones were in use.

191
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:48,049
Something fishy here.

192
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:51,048
They seemed like they knew
what they were doing

193
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,808
until they left...

194
00:09:54,448 --> 00:09:57,287
And had that Kodak moment.

195
00:10:01,647 --> 00:10:03,287
Moving on.

196
00:10:03,446 --> 00:10:05,686
Our main story tonight
concerns jobs.

197
00:10:05,846 --> 00:10:09,086
You know, the thing
every kid gets asked about.

198
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,045
I want to be--

199
00:10:13,205 --> 00:10:14,885
Hey, I never think--
thought of that.

200
00:10:15,045 --> 00:10:16,964
- I want to be a lawyer.
- Lawyer.

201
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:21,284
- Pilot.
- A pilot... And a dad.

202
00:10:21,444 --> 00:10:23,084
A pilot racer dad.

203
00:10:23,244 --> 00:10:26,963
I want to be an artist that
goes around painting walls.

204
00:10:27,123 --> 00:10:29,363
- I want to be a doctor.
- Doctor.

205
00:10:29,523 --> 00:10:32,082
- A mermaid.
- A mermaid doctor.

206
00:10:32,242 --> 00:10:34,282
Ooh, a mermaid doctor?

207
00:10:34,442 --> 00:10:37,161
I mean, sure, everyone wants
to be a mermaid doctor,

208
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:40,881
until, that is, you have to do your
first mermaid colonoscopy.

209
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,480
Two things you should know
about a mermaid's asshole, kid:

210
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,080
one, no matter where you're
picturing it, that's not where it is.

211
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,799
And two, no one comes out
the same person they went in.

212
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,559
A part of you dies in there, and you'll
spend your life trying to get it back.

213
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:58,078
Anyway, jobs were a major theme

214
00:10:58,238 --> 00:11:00,478
in Donald Trump's
presidential campaign,

215
00:11:00,638 --> 00:11:03,318
along with--of course--
walls, taco bowls,

216
00:11:03,478 --> 00:11:06,837
allegations of sexual assault,
and admissions of sexual assault.

217
00:11:06,997 --> 00:11:10,117
But Trump's primary focus
as candidate and president

218
00:11:10,277 --> 00:11:14,156
has been on jobs--
specifically, who was stealing them.

219
00:11:14,316 --> 00:11:18,275
Whether it's China or Japan
or Mexico, they're all taking our jobs.

220
00:11:18,435 --> 00:11:21,675
Now Vietnam. That's the new one.
They are taking our jobs.

221
00:11:21,835 --> 00:11:23,675
The jobs are being taken by India.

222
00:11:23,835 --> 00:11:25,394
Our jobs were stolen away

223
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:29,194
and shipped far away
to other countries,

224
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:31,633
some of which
you've never even heard of.

225
00:11:31,793 --> 00:11:34,353
Yes, our jobs are being stolen

226
00:11:34,513 --> 00:11:36,593
by countries
you've never even heard of.

227
00:11:36,753 --> 00:11:38,672
But remember
this is coming from the man

228
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:41,072
who reportedly
referred to Nepal and Bhutan

229
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:43,072
as "nipple" and "button."

230
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:47,111
So for Trump, "countries
you've never heard of"

231
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:50,471
could just mean
bulgy areola, barb's anus,

232
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:53,070
boring, urethra, honda rice,

233
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,630
ankle, fat hamster, fence,

234
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,589
Jeremy, bikini fatso, le sofa,

235
00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:00,629
balls-in-ya and hater-vagina,

236
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:03,069
gay water, butt swallow,

237
00:12:03,229 --> 00:12:06,388
licking time, Pocahonta,
lorks and blorsh,

238
00:12:06,548 --> 00:12:10,868
hot girl with jizz in her hair,
"my wife," my taco, grenade,

239
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:14,467
the one that sounds like a butt,
bad Asia, Slim Shady,

240
00:12:14,627 --> 00:12:16,627
queso bowl, fuck that,

241
00:12:16,787 --> 00:12:18,666
daddy fat hamster, lice,

242
00:12:18,826 --> 00:12:22,186
lesbian, Russia, Macarena,

243
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:23,866
vag lands, poo land,

244
00:12:24,026 --> 00:12:26,145
Pamela, marinara, seagull,

245
00:12:26,305 --> 00:12:29,665
pillow, Russia, Jared's friends,

246
00:12:29,825 --> 00:12:31,385
Santa kids and Norbit,

247
00:12:31,545 --> 00:12:34,784
more titties, guitar,
pair of gays, samosas, toga,

248
00:12:34,944 --> 00:12:36,464
to-go, feeling peens,

249
00:12:36,624 --> 00:12:40,143
the medium gross lettuce,
you're a gay, Zumba, Xanadu,

250
00:12:40,303 --> 00:12:42,063
magnolia, and hotel for dogs,

251
00:12:42,223 --> 00:12:44,903
no, wait, the one that's
not for dogs, hotel that one.

252
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:47,862
Basically, Trump's philosophy is,

253
00:12:48,022 --> 00:12:52,141
"The world: never heard of it,
but it's stealing your jobs."

254
00:12:52,301 --> 00:12:55,381
And look, some manufacturing
jobs are gone

255
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:59,940
because they went overseas,
but Trump is completely ignoring

256
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,140
another major factor behind job losses:
automation.

257
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,180
Its impact has been massive.

258
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:07,219
You wouldn't know it
from how Trump talks,

259
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:11,979
but our manufacturing sector produces
twice as much as it did in 1984,

260
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:15,458
but we produce it
with 1/3 fewer workers.

261
00:13:15,618 --> 00:13:18,458
The point is, many of
those jobs aren't being stolen.

262
00:13:18,618 --> 00:13:21,857
They are disappearing
because machines are now doing them.

263
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:24,217
And thanks to advances
in AI and robotics,

264
00:13:24,377 --> 00:13:27,376
there are concerns that
this sort of job loss could accelerate.

265
00:13:27,536 --> 00:13:30,296
In fact, a few years back,
some people got very concerned

266
00:13:30,456 --> 00:13:33,935
when an Oxford University study
came out with a startling number.

267
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:36,175
An Oxford University study
says that

268
00:13:36,335 --> 00:13:40,254
up to half of all jobs in the U.S.
are at risk to automation.

269
00:13:40,414 --> 00:13:42,814
A new study
which suggests many of us

270
00:13:42,974 --> 00:13:44,974
may lose our jobs because of robots.

271
00:13:45,134 --> 00:13:47,733
A robot is probably
going to take your job

272
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,893
according to
a new Oxford University study.

273
00:13:50,053 --> 00:13:54,132
That's close to 50% of the workforce
being completely eliminated,

274
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,532
as in no more jobs for them.

275
00:13:56,692 --> 00:14:00,451
Wow.
50% of all our jobs will be gone.

276
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:03,051
That is terrifying...
for you.

277
00:14:03,211 --> 00:14:06,650
I mean, luckily, a robot could never
be a late-night host.

278
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:10,610
It'd make basic mistakes, like, say,
devoting 90 seconds of air time

279
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:14,089
to a list of dumb names Trump might have
for other countries.

280
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:15,849
How weird would that be?

281
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:20,088
It's called pacing, robots. Look it up.
You don't do a massive list of names

282
00:14:20,248 --> 00:14:22,888
before you've introduced
the thesis of your piece.

283
00:14:23,048 --> 00:14:25,448
Anyway, the thesis of this piece

284
00:14:25,608 --> 00:14:29,647
is that while people often talk about
automation in apocalyptic terms,

285
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:33,446
the truth is, everything about it
is more complicated than you think,

286
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:37,046
including that "half your jobs
will be gone" Oxford study.

287
00:14:37,206 --> 00:14:40,605
So let's talk about automation.
And let's begin with the fact that,

288
00:14:40,765 --> 00:14:43,605
while it's often presented
as a scary new problem,

289
00:14:43,765 --> 00:14:46,644
it's neither entirely scary
nor entirely new.

290
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:50,324
From the industrial revolution
through the rise of mass production,

291
00:14:50,484 --> 00:14:52,524
automation has
transformed our society

292
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,403
in ways people have marveled at,

293
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:57,643
sometimes in
less-than-ideal language.

294
00:14:57,803 --> 00:15:00,762
<i>Power and the highly important</i>
<i>standardization of parts</i>

295
00:15:00,922 --> 00:15:03,162
<i>and mass production</i>
<i>with its assembly lines</i>

296
00:15:03,322 --> 00:15:06,002
<i>have created more</i>
<i>mechanical slaves for man.</i>

297
00:15:06,162 --> 00:15:08,841
<i>Mechanical slaves in</i>
<i>the machine tool industry--</i>

298
00:15:09,001 --> 00:15:12,121
<i>created by man</i>
<i>to create more mechanical slaves.</i>

299
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:14,920
<i>The average man</i>
<i>in the United States today</i>

300
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,840
<i>is said to have at his beck and call</i>
<i>20 mechanical slaves.</i>

301
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,439
"Slaves, slaves, slaves!
Oh, how I have missed them!

302
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:24,479
"Yes, mechanical slaves:

303
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,078
"if you close your eyes,
you can forget that they're mechanical."

304
00:15:28,238 --> 00:15:32,158
And, look, there is no doubt:
mechanical slaves-- or "machines"

305
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:34,757
as a normal person
might describe them--

306
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:37,157
have had hugely beneficial effects.

307
00:15:37,317 --> 00:15:41,236
They've made goods cheaper
and jobs easier and sometimes safer.

308
00:15:41,396 --> 00:15:43,596
Take this man.
He runs a logging company,

309
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:46,036
and he's developing machines
to fell trees,

310
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,755
which would put his own son
out of a job.

311
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:52,155
But he's doing it for
a pretty compelling reason.

312
00:15:52,315 --> 00:15:55,354
If you have a man on a chainsaw
falling trees,

313
00:15:55,514 --> 00:15:57,274
they're eventually
going to get hurt.

314
00:15:57,434 --> 00:16:00,833
<i>Logging has the highest death rate</i>
<i>of any American occupation.</i>

315
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:04,713
<i>For its size, logging kills people</i>
<i>at a higher rate than the military.</i>

316
00:16:04,873 --> 00:16:07,432
<i>I've come to the belief</i>
<i>that the only way</i>

317
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,832
<i>I can ensure the safety of my people</i>
<i>is not have 'em there.</i>

318
00:16:10,992 --> 00:16:13,992
The best way not to kill
a hand cutter is not have one.

319
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:18,431
He's right. The best way not to kill
a hand cutter is not to have one,

320
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:22,630
which presumably means the best way
to kill a hand cutter is to have one.

321
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,590
So if you are trying
to murder a lumberjack,

322
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,229
it's probably best
just to hire him and wait.

323
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:31,429
Also--also don't do it.
D-don't do it.

324
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:35,228
But if you really want to, that'd be how
to go about it. But you shouldn't.

325
00:16:35,388 --> 00:16:37,628
You shouldn't,
although I've just given you

326
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,988
a perfect blueprint
for how to get away with it.

327
00:16:40,148 --> 00:16:42,667
But again, I want to make
this absolutely clear:

328
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:45,827
nobody out there
should murder a lumberjack.

329
00:16:45,987 --> 00:16:49,666
You should just wait for them to die
in an accident. It's the perfect crime.

330
00:16:49,826 --> 00:16:52,786
But the truth is,
from employers' point of view,

331
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:54,865
the big selling point for automation

332
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:58,225
is that it increases productivity
and it maximizes profits.

333
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,825
And for displaced workers,

334
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:03,984
that has caused immense pain throughout
history, and not just in factories.

335
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:07,104
In the '90s, as voice recognition
technology improved,

336
00:17:07,264 --> 00:17:10,703
phone company operators
were rightly worried for their jobs.

337
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,023
My first thought was, "Uh-oh.

338
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:14,583
"Here comes trouble.

339
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,902
This is gonna get my job
for sure."

340
00:17:17,062 --> 00:17:19,342
I thought that
this is gonna be a robot.

341
00:17:19,502 --> 00:17:22,221
They won't need as many operators.
I'll lose my job.

342
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:25,741
I talked to some friends of mine
from the Shreveport office,

343
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:28,380
and the rumors were running
rampant over there.

344
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,860
You know, like,
"They're testing this machine.

345
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,940
"It's gonna do away
with our job, they're--

346
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,939
"we heard they're shutting down
y'all's office and going to machines."

347
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:40,139
First of all-- and I know this
isn't the point here, but--

348
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:43,018
what the fuck is going on
in Shreveport?

349
00:17:43,178 --> 00:17:45,578
Lisa Lee here is your friend,
and you're all,

350
00:17:45,738 --> 00:17:49,017
"Hey, Lisa, you're gonna get fired"?
Fuck you, Shreveport!

351
00:17:49,177 --> 00:17:52,537
Girl, you deserve friends
who lift you up, not tear you down.

352
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,657
Remember how far you've come.

353
00:17:54,817 --> 00:17:57,416
You don't need Shreveport.
Shreveport needs you.

354
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,096
Now you pick yourself up,
and you show the world

355
00:18:00,256 --> 00:18:04,175
what Lisa Lee is really made of.
You go, girl!

356
00:18:04,335 --> 00:18:06,415
You go!

357
00:18:06,575 --> 00:18:11,894
But when you see this story
through the eyes of worried employees,

358
00:18:12,054 --> 00:18:14,854
you can understand
the deep-seated human urge

359
00:18:15,014 --> 00:18:17,573
that many of us have
to see robots come to harm,

360
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:20,373
whether we're joyously
retweeting this photo,

361
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:24,012
captioned, "Our D.C. office
building got a security robot.

362
00:18:24,172 --> 00:18:26,292
It drowned itself."

363
00:18:26,452 --> 00:18:30,411
Or just attacking any robot
foolish enough to trust us.

364
00:18:30,571 --> 00:18:33,411
<i>The idea was to see</i>
<i>how people would interact</i>

365
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:37,610
<i>with a talking solar-powered robot</i>
<i>as it hitched across America</i>

366
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,330
<i>on its own tracked by a GPS.</i>

367
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,489
<i>On Saturday, the robot was found</i>
<i>in Philadelphia,</i>

368
00:18:43,649 --> 00:18:47,769
<i>the city of brotherly love,</i>
<i>resting in pieces.</i>

369
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:50,288
<i>Late today,</i>
<i>video surfaced of the attack,</i>

370
00:18:50,448 --> 00:18:54,008
<i>but the robot's creators</i>
<i>are not out for revenge.</i>

371
00:18:54,168 --> 00:18:56,007
I'm sure it could have
happened anywhere.

372
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:59,367
We don't think it has anything
to do with Philadelphia.

373
00:18:59,527 --> 00:19:01,607
You're wrong about that.

374
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:05,566
It has absolutely everything
to do with Philadelphia.

375
00:19:05,726 --> 00:19:09,405
This is a city with a chronic
police horse punching problem.

376
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,205
Sending a hitchhiking robot
into Philadelphia

377
00:19:12,365 --> 00:19:16,444
is not unlike sending a beautiful bell
symbolizing freedom into Philadelphia.

378
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:18,844
There is no way it's gonna
remain in one piece,

379
00:19:19,004 --> 00:19:22,604
and there's a non-zero chance
that someone is gonna try and fuck it.

380
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:25,803
So, so...

381
00:19:27,763 --> 00:19:31,522
At this point, you may be thinking,
"Well, whatever its advantages,

382
00:19:31,682 --> 00:19:34,562
automation throws a lot of
people out of work, right?"

383
00:19:34,722 --> 00:19:37,401
Well, yes, but again,
it is complicated,

384
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:39,481
and the picture
often gets distorted.

385
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:41,161
Remember that report from earlier?

386
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:44,440
The one that led to claims that
half of our jobs were going away?

387
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,400
There are real concerns
about its methodology,

388
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,119
and other studies have come up with
much lower numbers.

389
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:53,759
But more importantly, it didn't claim
half of jobs would be gone.

390
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,318
It suggested some jobs were in the
high-risk category for being automated,

391
00:19:58,478 --> 00:20:00,718
and that's
a very different thing,

392
00:20:00,878 --> 00:20:04,957
because a job automated
is not necessarily a job lost.

393
00:20:05,117 --> 00:20:09,117
Frequently, machines don't replace jobs
so much as tasks.

394
00:20:09,277 --> 00:20:11,276
A good example of this
concerns ATMs.

395
00:20:11,436 --> 00:20:14,916
It is hard to imagine a time
now that they weren't around,

396
00:20:15,076 --> 00:20:17,235
but when they became common
in the 1980s,

397
00:20:17,395 --> 00:20:19,875
bank tellers were afraid
of them stealing their jobs.

398
00:20:20,035 --> 00:20:22,715
Of course, customers were
sometimes afraid of them

399
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,434
for very different reasons.

400
00:20:24,594 --> 00:20:26,474
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah, it hurts.

401
00:20:26,634 --> 00:20:29,274
<i>Ignoring the adage</i>
<i>"never bite the hand that feeds you,"</i>

402
00:20:29,434 --> 00:20:31,993
<i>the Bank of America</i>
<i>versateller did just that,</i>

403
00:20:32,153 --> 00:20:35,753
<i>snapped onto Paul's hand while he was</i>
<i>trying to transact business with it.</i>

404
00:20:35,913 --> 00:20:38,672
I thought if I reach in there,
I can pull an envelope out

405
00:20:38,832 --> 00:20:41,312
and go ahead and make the deposit
and go on to work.

406
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:43,831
I'm trying to get to work, yeah.

407
00:20:43,991 --> 00:20:46,711
That man died.

408
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,031
Not of that. Not of that.
That's ridiculous.

409
00:20:49,191 --> 00:20:52,310
He died two years later,
when he got stuck inside a claw machine.

410
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,310
That's a fact.
What is that fact based on?

411
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,029
Nothing other than my total
conviction that it's true.

412
00:20:59,189 --> 00:21:02,429
But while ATMs did
eat the occasional customer,

413
00:21:02,589 --> 00:21:06,188
fears of job losses turned out
to be completely overblown,

414
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,148
because bank teller employment
actually increased

415
00:21:09,308 --> 00:21:10,627
over the next 30 years.

416
00:21:10,787 --> 00:21:14,187
What happened was, ATMs took over
the job of dispensing cash

417
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:17,386
and tellers were then freed up
to do sales or other work.

418
00:21:17,546 --> 00:21:20,506
Their jobs didn't go;
they changed.

419
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:24,105
And when automation does lead
to job loss in certain sectors,

420
00:21:24,265 --> 00:21:26,665
historically, it's also
actually created jobs,

421
00:21:26,825 --> 00:21:29,265
as this economist from MIT explains.

422
00:21:29,425 --> 00:21:32,864
Let's do the following thought exercise.
It's the year 1900,

423
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:37,463
and 40% of all employment
is in agriculture, right?

424
00:21:37,623 --> 00:21:42,543
And so some twerpy economist from MIT
teleports back in time and says,

425
00:21:42,703 --> 00:21:44,143
"100 years from now,

426
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:47,462
"only 2% of people will be
working in agriculture.

427
00:21:47,622 --> 00:21:50,742
What do you think the other
38% of people are gonna do?"

428
00:21:50,902 --> 00:21:52,581
- I wouldn't know.
- You wouldn't say,

429
00:21:52,741 --> 00:21:54,901
"Search engine optimization."
You know,

430
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:57,421
"health and wellness,
software and mobile devices."

431
00:21:57,581 --> 00:22:00,260
Most of what we do barely existed.

432
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,460
Exactly.
That "twerpy economist" is right.

433
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,619
50 years from now,
people will be doing jobs

434
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:08,779
that we can't imagine right now,
like cryptobaker

435
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:10,579
or snail rehydrator

436
00:22:10,739 --> 00:22:12,778
or investment harpist.
I don't know.

437
00:22:12,938 --> 00:22:15,178
The point is,
you can't imagine them.

438
00:22:15,338 --> 00:22:18,737
So we get rid of some jobs
but we get new ones.

439
00:22:18,897 --> 00:22:21,377
So that's even Stephen, right?
Not necessarily,

440
00:22:21,537 --> 00:22:23,417
because the new jobs
automation creates

441
00:22:23,577 --> 00:22:26,696
won't necessarily pay the same
as the ones it takes away,

442
00:22:26,856 --> 00:22:30,296
and it might not be easy for displaced
workers to transition into them.

443
00:22:30,456 --> 00:22:34,295
Right now, our economy is creating
lots of jobs in the tech sector.

444
00:22:34,455 --> 00:22:37,295
At the same time,
we have 3 1/2 million truckers

445
00:22:37,455 --> 00:22:40,294
possibly facing unemployment
due to driverless technology.

446
00:22:40,454 --> 00:22:43,614
Now, in an ideal world, those truckers
could seamlessly move

447
00:22:43,774 --> 00:22:45,093
into high-tech jobs.

448
00:22:45,253 --> 00:22:48,253
But as this man explains,
it's just not that easy.

449
00:22:48,413 --> 00:22:50,093
If the average age is 55,

450
00:22:50,253 --> 00:22:52,732
these guys are going to be
computer programmers

451
00:22:52,892 --> 00:22:55,412
when they didn't finish high school?
I doubt it.

452
00:22:55,572 --> 00:22:59,211
Of course. I mean, but maybe
some 55-year-old truck drivers

453
00:22:59,371 --> 00:23:02,371
will become web designers,
but if you think all of them will,

454
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:04,771
remember that time
your father accidentally

455
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:08,170
typed his Google search into Facebook
and then tried to cover it up

456
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,370
by putting Wite-Out on the computer.

457
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,729
So the big question here is,

458
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:16,409
how do you harness
what is good about automation

459
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:19,088
while minimizing the damage
to those hurt by it?

460
00:23:19,248 --> 00:23:20,568
The best thing would be

461
00:23:20,728 --> 00:23:24,008
if America were in the hands
of someone nimble and forward-thinking.

462
00:23:24,168 --> 00:23:27,167
And unfortunately, that
brings us back to this guy.

463
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:30,487
And he has not demonstrated
much of a grasp on this issue.

464
00:23:30,647 --> 00:23:34,446
Look at what happened with a company
called Carrier. After the election,

465
00:23:34,606 --> 00:23:37,166
Trump, with the aid
of a massive tax break,

466
00:23:37,326 --> 00:23:40,365
convinced the CEO of Carrier's
parent company, Greg Hayes,

467
00:23:40,525 --> 00:23:42,365
not to move a factory to Mexico.

468
00:23:42,525 --> 00:23:45,205
He made a big deal
out of saving those jobs,

469
00:23:45,365 --> 00:23:47,764
and he was excited
about what was coming next.

470
00:23:47,924 --> 00:23:51,044
They're gonna spend so much money
on renovating this plant.

471
00:23:51,204 --> 00:23:54,083
And I said, "Greg, say that number."
He said "$16 million."

472
00:23:54,243 --> 00:23:58,723
The minimum number is 16. It's gonna be,
in my opinion, a lot more than that.

473
00:23:58,883 --> 00:24:01,442
He said, "Well, I'd rather say
the lower number."

474
00:24:01,602 --> 00:24:04,562
I'd rather have them say the higher
number. So I won't say it.

475
00:24:04,722 --> 00:24:07,521
It's just a difference in philosophy.
Right? Both are okay.

476
00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:10,361
Difference in philosophy.
But they'll spend more than 16.

477
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:12,560
They'll spend a lot of money
on the plant.

478
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,920
"It's a difference
in philosophy, you see?

479
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,720
"I wanna lie; he doesn't wanna lie.

480
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,120
"Both are okay.
I'm still gonna lie to you;

481
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,359
"I'll just do it vaguely, for Greg.
This lie's for you, Greg.

482
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:25,679
"Greg's gonna spend way more
than $16 million on the plant."

483
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,918
Here's the thing
about that $16 million.

484
00:24:28,078 --> 00:24:30,198
It wasn't good news
for the workers,

485
00:24:30,358 --> 00:24:33,437
as Greg Hayes made clear
just a few days later.

486
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,477
We'll make
a $16 million investment

487
00:24:35,637 --> 00:24:39,157
in that factory in Indianapolis
to automate, to drive the costs down

488
00:24:39,317 --> 00:24:41,076
so we can continue
to be competitive.

489
00:24:41,236 --> 00:24:43,916
What that ultimately means
is there will be fewer jobs.

490
00:24:44,076 --> 00:24:46,355
Oh, great work,
Mr. President.

491
00:24:46,515 --> 00:24:49,115
So Carrier workers
are still going to lose their jobs.

492
00:24:49,275 --> 00:24:52,075
It's just the government now helped,
for some reason,

493
00:24:52,235 --> 00:24:54,234
pay for the robots
that will replace them.

494
00:24:54,394 --> 00:24:56,394
That is the classic Trump deal-making

495
00:24:56,554 --> 00:24:58,954
that you can read all about
in his best-selling book

496
00:24:59,114 --> 00:25:01,593
"The Art of Saying Whatever
and Letting Someone Else,

497
00:25:01,753 --> 00:25:04,233
"Hey, Maybe Even a Robot,
Deal With the Consequences.

498
00:25:04,393 --> 00:25:07,712
"Is That a Good Title? Why Not?
Moot Point, 'Cause It's 11:45 a.m.,

499
00:25:07,872 --> 00:25:11,312
Which is Basically Noon,
So That's Lunch."

500
00:25:11,472 --> 00:25:14,271
And the Trump administration's
response to automation

501
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:17,431
hasn't gotten much better,
because for someone who claims

502
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:20,110
that he cares so much
about the American worker,

503
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,630
he's done almost nothing to help
people displaced by automation,

504
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,110
and there is plenty
that he could be doing.

505
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,949
One set of proposals includes
funding retraining;

506
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:31,789
ideally, retraining
that is directly tailored

507
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:33,668
to available jobs in your area.

508
00:25:33,828 --> 00:25:37,468
That seems like a sensible idea,
as does trying to help older workers

509
00:25:37,628 --> 00:25:40,747
who may end up having to take a new job
with a lower salary

510
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:44,547
through things like wage insurance
or an expanded earned income tax credit.

511
00:25:44,707 --> 00:25:47,506
All of that will cost money
and quite a lot of it,

512
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:50,306
so Trump will probably revert
to his preferred solution,

513
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,986
blaming China, Vietnam,
and other countries

514
00:25:53,146 --> 00:25:55,185
you've probably never even heard of.

515
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:58,465
In the meantime, we need to start
preparing younger workers

516
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:00,504
for the job market
they're about to enter,

517
00:26:00,664 --> 00:26:03,944
because the pace of technological change
is now so rapid,

518
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,424
some experts suggest that
we might need to rethink

519
00:26:06,584 --> 00:26:08,943
our basic conception of a career.

520
00:26:09,103 --> 00:26:13,303
<i>The majority of people will end up</i>
<i>having an episodic career.</i>

521
00:26:13,463 --> 00:26:15,142
<i>It's great to ask kids, for instance,</i>

522
00:26:15,302 --> 00:26:17,062
what do you want to be
when you grow up?

523
00:26:17,222 --> 00:26:21,341
But one thing that might
be added to that question is,

524
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:24,701
what five things do you want to be
when you grow up?

525
00:26:24,861 --> 00:26:26,341
She's right about that,

526
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,980
and that means that the girl from before
who said "mermaid doctor"

527
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,700
may need to come up
with some backup plans,

528
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,059
partly because that job may be partially
automated in the future,

529
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,779
and partly because, honestly,
rising ocean temperatures

530
00:26:38,939 --> 00:26:41,258
are gonna kill all the mermaids.
It's just a fact.

531
00:26:41,418 --> 00:26:43,218
They're going to be boiled alive.

532
00:26:43,378 --> 00:26:47,338
And look, I've thrown a lot of
complication at you tonight,

533
00:26:47,497 --> 00:26:51,737
but the one thing we know for sure
is automation is not going to stop,

534
00:26:51,897 --> 00:26:54,256
and some people
are going to lose their jobs.

535
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:58,016
So we should help those that do
and be preparing the next generation

536
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:02,615
for the possibility that they may need
to be flexible in their career plans.

537
00:27:02,775 --> 00:27:04,735
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

538
00:27:04,895 --> 00:27:06,575
I want to be an inventor.

539
00:27:06,735 --> 00:27:08,694
Rock star ballerina.

540
00:27:08,854 --> 00:27:11,454
- I want to be a musician.
- A nurse.

541
00:27:11,614 --> 00:27:13,654
A person who
takes people on safari.

542
00:27:13,814 --> 00:27:16,973
- Stenographer.
- A fashion designer.

543
00:27:17,133 --> 00:27:19,573
So are you worried
about robots taking over

544
00:27:19,733 --> 00:27:21,572
- ...certain jobs?
- No.

545
00:27:21,732 --> 00:27:26,132
Okay, you might need
to be aware of that long-term.

546
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:29,131
Tell you what. You name some jobs,
and I'll tell you whether

547
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:31,491
I think a robot
could do it or not, okay?

548
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:33,571
- Policeman.
- A robot could do that.

549
00:27:33,731 --> 00:27:35,490
That's literally the plot
of "Robocop."

550
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,690
Serve food, like at a diner.

551
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,850
Robots could definitely do that,
Zoe, sorry.

552
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:43,129
- Can a robot get wet?
- Yeah, a robot can get wet.

553
00:27:43,289 --> 00:27:45,929
That's not a job,
but, yes, a robot can get wet.

554
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:48,128
- Fireman.
- Robot with a hose.

555
00:27:48,288 --> 00:27:50,368
- Right?
- Yeah.

556
00:27:50,528 --> 00:27:53,488
- A drummer.
- A robot could definitely do the drums.

557
00:27:53,648 --> 00:27:55,687
They'd be probably really bad
at basketball.

558
00:27:55,847 --> 00:27:57,927
Robots are actually
incredible at basketball.

559
00:27:58,087 --> 00:28:00,487
- What? Really?
- Yeah. Here. Look at this.

560
00:28:00,647 --> 00:28:03,926
I'm gonna Google
"robot drummer" right now.

561
00:28:04,086 --> 00:28:05,406
- Okay?
- Okay.

562
00:28:05,566 --> 00:28:08,285
I just put "robot d,"
and it autocorrected.

563
00:28:08,445 --> 00:28:12,805
- I am definitely faster than--
- You're definitely faster than a robot?

564
00:28:12,965 --> 00:28:14,685
- Mm-hmm.
- Here's the thing.

565
00:28:14,845 --> 00:28:16,884
You're definitely not.

566
00:28:17,044 --> 00:28:18,804
Let me show you this.

567
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:22,403
Laura, do you think a robot
could do my job in the future?

568
00:28:22,563 --> 00:28:24,163
What is your job anyway?

569
00:28:24,323 --> 00:28:26,123
Uh, we-- so we take a big story,

570
00:28:26,283 --> 00:28:29,482
and we try and inject it
with as much nuance as we can.

571
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:34,322
So we really try and get a deep dive
into complicated issues,

572
00:28:34,482 --> 00:28:38,721
and then I present our work,
you know, to the audience

573
00:28:38,881 --> 00:28:40,241
at the end of the week.

574
00:28:40,401 --> 00:28:43,880
- Do you think a robot could do that?
- Yup.

575
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,480
- This is really hard.
- Well, what can I do?

576
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,599
What can you do?
Very good question.

577
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,079
A series of nonroutine tasks
that require social intelligence,

578
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:57,118
complex critical thinking,
and creative problem-solving, okay?

579
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:59,918
- Okay.
- Can you repeat that back to me?

580
00:29:00,078 --> 00:29:02,477
I want to do
a series of nonroutine tasks...

581
00:29:02,637 --> 00:29:05,917
I want to do
a series of nonroutine tasks...

582
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,117
- Tah-sks.
- Tah-sks.

583
00:29:08,277 --> 00:29:10,356
You're doing
a British accent there, Zoe.

584
00:29:10,516 --> 00:29:14,716
- That requires social intelligence...
- That requires social intelligence...

585
00:29:14,876 --> 00:29:17,835
- Complex critical thinking...
- What?

586
00:29:17,995 --> 00:29:22,315
- Complex critical thinking.
- And creative problem-solving.

587
00:29:22,474 --> 00:29:26,714
- And creative problem-solving.
- And creative problem-solving.

588
00:29:26,874 --> 00:29:28,554
That's what you got to do.

589
00:29:28,714 --> 00:29:30,113
- Okay.
- Yeah?

590
00:29:30,273 --> 00:29:32,313
Okay, is that a deal?

591
00:29:32,473 --> 00:29:34,633
We did it.

592
00:29:34,793 --> 00:29:39,192
- I, like, don't know what it means.
- Okay.

593
00:29:39,352 --> 00:29:41,312
That's our show.
Thank you for watching.

594
00:29:41,472 --> 00:29:43,431
See you next week.
Good night!
