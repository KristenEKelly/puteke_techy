LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,600
SEASON VI
EPISODE 14

3
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,680
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,360
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,520
A quick recap of the week.

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,400
We begin with the United Kingdom:
America's deadbeat dad.

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,680
The UK weathered
a visit from Donald Trump,

8
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,520
who met with the queen, wearing
the world's most ill fitting tuxedo

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,240
and sat down for an interview
with Piers Morgan,

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,840
in which he was given
a Winston Churchill hat.

11
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,640
- Let me try this on.
- Please. That'd be great.

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,000
- It's a little big.
- We can get that... That's fantastic.

13
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,240
- Let me see how that looks.
- So, Winston Trump.

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,320
Winston looked
much better in it.

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,520
I agree with Trump on that one,
he does look like shit in that hat.

16
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,920
Anyone looks like an asshole
when wearing a Churchill hat.

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,040
Even Churchill kind of looked
like an asshole

18
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,000
when wearing a Churchill hat.

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,920
Trump still looks like
an asshole without the hat.

20
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,360
Trump was in the UK at
a very dramatic time.

21
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,080
Two weeks ago, Theresa May
announced her resignation,

22
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,600
after failing to negotiate
a Brexit deal,

23
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,640
a decision to which I think
the citizens of Gogglebox,

24
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,760
the magnificent show
where ordinary Britons watch TV,

25
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,320
had the proper response.

26
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,480
I will leave the job that it has been
the honor of my life to hold.

27
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,480
Wobbly voice.

28
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,200
- I feel really sorry for her.
- Why ?

29
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,960
Sorry ? She fucked it up.

30
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,640
She had three years to get it right
and got it gloriously wrong.

31
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,720
That is the right sentiment.
I don't know if I would describe

32
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,680
Theresa May's job on Brexit
as "gloriously wrong".

33
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,160
"Gloriously wrong" is how I would
describe this fireworks show in 2012,

34
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,200
when organizers accidentally set
off all 45 minutes worth of fireworks

35
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,360
at the same time,
take a look.

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,360
Glorious. Wrong.
Gloriously wrong.

37
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,840
May's last day as conservative
leader was actually Friday,

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,760
but she's staying on
until her successor is chosen

39
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,880
through a ridiculous process,
there will be no general election.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,920
The new leader will be chosen
by May's party, the conservatives.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,960
The next prime minister will be chosen
by 124 000 paid members of the party,

42
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,720
most of whom are over 55
and from the top social class.

43
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,240
A small group of out-of-touch
old people is going to decide

44
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,600
the future of the entire country.

45
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,760
It's like if Great Britain
had its own Florida.

46
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,160
And nobody wants that.
Who are the contenders here ?

47
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,360
Currently and appallingly, the leading
candidate is Boris Johnson,

48
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,080
who answers the question:

49
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,920
"What would Kevin McCallister
have looked like,"

50
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,960
"if his parents
never came home ?"

51
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,040
Johnson is widely known for a few
reasons, none of them good.

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,400
Before he helped sell Brexit
with a series of lies,

53
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,400
he served
as the mayor of London,

54
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,720
where he embarrassed himself
getting stuck on a zip line

55
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,880
and, in Japan, playing rugby
with children and doing this.

56
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,880
There may be no more
apt metaphor for modern-day Britain

57
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,280
than an overconfident old man
steamrolling a young person.

58
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,600
Johnson doesn't just seem like
a fucking moron, he is a fucking moron.

59
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,680
During his time as foreign secretary,
officials characterized him

60
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,440
as woefully underprepared,
making crucial mistakes and being,

61
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,640
and here I'm quoting directly,
a "fucking moron".

62
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,800
Unfortunately for Britain,
Johnson's opponents are also terrible.

63
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,880
One of his main competitors
is this man, Michael Gove,

64
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,840
environment secretary
and self-professed rap fan.

65
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,640
When a student asked him to give
a sample of his favorite rap music,

66
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,360
his answer wasn't great.

67
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,200
The first rap I heard
was actually called a vanilla rap,

68
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,600
which was the Wham! rap,
Andrew Ridgeley and George Michael.

69
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,320
Take a look at me,
I've got street credibility.

70
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,440
I have a good time
With the boys I meet down on the line.

71
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,000
Fresh.

72
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,400
Michael Gove can't rap. You could
tell that before he started doing it.

73
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,120
It's just one of many things you
can tell simply by looking at him:

74
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,600
he can't rap, he can't dance,
he likes Wham!, he wears briefs,

75
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,960
he uses a knife
and fork when eating pizza

76
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,240
and he'd be
a terrible prime minister.

77
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,960
A scandal involving cocaine could
torpedo his chances to topple Johnson.

78
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,040
That leaves it up to one of these
other contenders.

79
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,320
The problem is
they're all very bad.

80
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,360
The most reasonable among them
in this terrible bunch is Rory Stewart,

81
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,040
who's argued against a hard,
no-deal Brexit.

82
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,840
Stewart is far from
an ideal candidate himself.

83
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,920
He is very active online, posting
truly F-minus selfies like this.

84
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,640
That is a face whose sheer Britishness
is perhaps best-described

85
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,160
as "metastasized".

86
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,240
Stewart has no shot at winning,
which may be why he's taken

87
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,520
to wandering around the country
equipped with two things:

88
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,680
an iPhone and the desire
to the bicker with strangers.

89
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,720
I'm in Borough Market, talking
about issues beyond Brexit,

90
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,880
and if you want to come and have
a conversation in the next hours,

91
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,480
come and find me here.

92
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,520
Hello, I'm now in Woking.

93
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,720
Looking forward to meeting people
in the town square.

94
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,200
I'm in Barking, continuing
the conversation in Borough Market.

95
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,560
Come and meet me anytime,
Lewisham Market, bye.

96
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,520
Sorry to break this to you,
Rory,

97
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,560
but no one wants to go on a scavenger
hunt through random towns in England

98
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,640
where the prize is being bored
by someone who looks like

99
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,480
Eddie Redmayne fucked Willem Dafoe
in a Wallace and Gromit cartoon.

100
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,200
Stewart doesn't just invite
people on his walks,

101
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,760
he also posts about the aftermath,
including this odd report.

102
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,920
I'm in Barking,
which voted 62 percent leave,

103
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,280
and what I've picked up is, that this
isn't a nation divided into two camps.

104
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,800
People want to talk about
different issues,

105
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,640
from air quality to somebody
who witnessed a mugging in the street.

106
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,960
Wait. First of all: witnessing
a mugging isn't an "issue".

107
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,440
It's a direct request
to please contact the police.

108
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,200
It seems impossible that a mugger
would be on the same street

109
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,360
as Rory Stewart, this man,
and choose to mug someone else.

110
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,360
As cringe-inducing as Stewart can be,
I will say this for him:

111
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,720
unlike Boris Johnson,
he's ruled out a no-deal Brexit

112
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,080
and he's never steamrolled a child
in a meaningless sporting contest.

113
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,960
Or, so we thought. Because
according to a New Yorker profile,

114
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,720
when he was in college, Rory was
selected by Prince Charles

115
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,480
to tutor princes William and Harry
in the summer of 1993.

116
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,760
Why am I bringing this up ?
A documentary crew was there

117
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,720
and footage shows Stewart playing
soccer with Prince Harry and others

118
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,680
and, I quote: "Stewart can be seen
tackling a boy half his size."

119
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,800
That is intriguing.
Now, would you like to see that ?

120
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,840
Yes, we found it !
Ignore the voiceover of Prince Charles,

121
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,880
just watch
what happens onscreen !

122
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,440
The prince and his children, often come
here with friends of the family.

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Do you like
being with the children ?

124
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,880
Of course, I do. I really don't know
whether they like being with me.

125
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:10,960
My God ! That is Prince William
that Rory Stewart viciously attacked !

126
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,920
We were pleased with ourselves
for finding that,

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,600
until we started to wonder:
that doesn't look like Rory Stewart.

128
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,080
He's blond there. Did he have
lighter hair when he was younger ?

129
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,120
It's possible. Or, is that
not actually Rory Stewart ?

130
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,080
This is where our week got weird.
Because if it wasn't Rory,

131
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,080
then why, for nine years,
did he not correct the record ?

132
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,480
We thought
maybe we found the wrong fall.

133
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,440
We looked elsewhere in the tape

134
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,120
and there's two more
moments of boy-violence.

135
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,320
There is this moment,
but that's a child slipping.

136
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,680
No "forceful tackle" on display
there, so that can't be it.

137
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,200
There's a second,
forceful incident,

138
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,920
where it's Prince Harry on
the receiving end of a heavy tackle.

139
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,040
Go on, Harry.

140
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,520
That is the same somewhat-too-blond
potential Rory that we saw before,

141
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,200
with a blue-sweatered
potential Rory also in the fray.

142
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,440
Bluesweatered boy,
that's the real Rory, right ?

143
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,720
He looks too young to be in college,
doesn't he ? So, it can't be him.

144
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,320
We noticed a third potential
Rory, right here. Who's that ?

145
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,960
He certainly seems the most Rory-ish,

146
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,720
in that he seems to be walking
randomly and nobody wants him there.

147
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,800
That's on brand.
But there's more evidence

148
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,440
because the New Yorker
described him back then

149
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,400
as "not fully adult, with
a long neck and a big head."

150
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,760
That squares with the bobble-headed,
pencil-necked young twerp here.

151
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,680
That's him, isn't it ?
Except, the problem is,

152
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,520
he's not implicated tackling
anywhere in this video.

153
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,720
Quite the opposite !
A moment later,

154
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,280
we see him very kindly walking
Prince Harry off the field.

155
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,920
We felt confident of two things:
one, this was Rory Stewart.

156
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,920
And two, he'd been falsely
accused of boy-tackling.

157
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,680
But...

158
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,160
Then we watched the tape
one more time

159
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,200
and there's a small moment,
when potential Rory Three

160
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,000
is walking Harry off the field.

161
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,600
The game is about to re-start,
listen closely to what is shouted.

162
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,320
All right, Rory.

163
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:21,560
You all heard that. Someone
clearly shouted, "All right, Rory."

164
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,000
You assume that's addressed
to the person holding the ball.

165
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,200
"All right, Rory,
let play continue."

166
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,160
But the person holding the ball is
the too-blond potential Rory.

167
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,720
So, it was him ! Rory Stewart did
demolish the heir to the throne !

168
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,720
At this point, our staff was divided
and we obsessed over this tape

169
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,040
like it was the fucking
Zapruder film.

170
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,080
Some of us here subscribed to
the "Second Rory theory".

171
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,440
It's complicated, and we don't
have time to get into everything,

172
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,120
but basically:
we think there's a second Rory.

173
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,000
On our umpteenth viewing of this
tape, we noticed something new:

174
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,600
we'd all been looking
at the boy with the ball.

175
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,880
Watch what happens
when non-violent potential Rory Three

176
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,680
is walking Harry off the field.

177
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,800
Watch how he reacts to that
shout of: "All right, Rory."

178
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,440
I'm gonna zoom in and play this
at half-speed so you can see.

179
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,360
All right, Rory.

180
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,360
He turned around
like the fucking Rory he is !

181
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,960
Watch him !
Back and to the left !

182
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,800
We got you so good !
That is the real Rory !

183
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,280
He didn't tackle anyone !
He is innocent of boy-bashing !

184
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,400
And yet, he's let this allegation
hang over him for nine years !

185
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:42,080
Why ? This brings us back to the battle
to become prime minister of Britain.

186
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,040
Rory knows the key qualification
to be British prime minister

187
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,840
is actually to be very weird
around children.

188
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,640
They've all done it. Here's
Theresa May, scowling at a child.

189
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,040
Here's Gordon Brown,
making a little girl cry.

190
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,240
And here's David Cameron,

191
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,160
anesthetizing a schoolgirl
with his personality.

192
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,440
We've already seen Boris and
Wham!'s biggest fan, Michael Gove,

193
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,760
cleared this bar.

194
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,040
Could it be that Rory Stewart
was happy to let people think

195
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,760
he was terrible around children,
when, in fact,

196
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,200
his behavior
is disqualifyingly normal ?

197
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,040
The British people deserve answers.
Rory Stewart, for some reason,

198
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,960
likes advertising and asking
people to come question him.

199
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,680
To the people of Britain I say this:

200
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,520
the next time he pops up
in Basingstoke farmer's market,

201
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,640
requesting a debate,
it is your right, your patriotic duty,

202
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,880
to turn up and ask him:
"Which fucking Rory are you ?"

203
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,960
Tall blond Rory ?
Young blue-sweatered Rory ?

204
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,640
Or the Rory too cowardly
to kick Prince Harry in the head ?

205
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,240
Consider this a Rory election.
It's like a Tory election,

206
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,880
only less stupid, because
at least in this one,

207
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,640
there is zero chance of
Boris Johnson winning.

208
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,840
And now this.

209
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,040
Gordon Ramsay
Wants to Fuck His Food.

210
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,320
The more effort, passion
and love you show the ham now,

211
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,880
the results are ten fold.

212
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,120
Take handfuls of salt
and just sort of rub it in.

213
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,000
Bend it over and in all those cracks.
A nice big dollop in the middle.

214
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,440
Don't be tight with your cream.
Hold it and put your fingers on there.

215
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,560
Three finger rule: one finger
in front, two behind,

216
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,600
pinky holding it down,
thumb holding nice and flat.

217
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,280
I just want to dive in there.
Long strokes with a knife.

218
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,440
Take your time.
Turn it 180.

219
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,920
Nice.

220
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,680
Incredible.

221
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,080
God. Gently.

222
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,520
This is the bit you've
been waiting for.

223
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,840
My God ! I'm in Heaven !

224
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,000
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns women.

225
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,880
Judging from bathroom signs,
men who've swallowed a trapezoid.

226
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,400
It's been a rough few years
in America for women,

227
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,240
from abortion bans, to the confirmation
of a Supreme Court justice

228
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,200
with resting beer face
to the election of a President

229
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,560
who thinks
of their genitals as handles.

230
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,840
To balance it all out,
women did also get this.

231
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,200
You are not seeing things.
McDonald's iconic golden arches

232
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,680
have been flipped upside down
and turned into a "W" for "women".

233
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,320
Nice going, WcDonald's.
Why did you stop there ?

234
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,840
The golden arches are versatile.
Flip them upside down for "women",

235
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,000
turn them on their side for "eunuchs",
and turn them on their other side

236
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,680
into a "3" for the actual number
of rats you need to make one McRib.

237
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,320
I'm not saying that rats
are in the McRib.

238
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,280
I'm saying they make them.
It's disgusting but in a different way.

239
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,440
This week saw
a historic milestone.

240
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,480
Tuesday marked the 100th anniversary
of Congress passing 19th Amendment,

241
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,840
which enshrined in the
constitution women's right to vote.

242
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,360
A long time, and when you think
about it, not nearly long enough.

243
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,200
In an ideal world,
women would've been guaranteed

244
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,160
the right to vote for a lot longer than
Kirk Douglas has been breathing.

245
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,000
I want to focus on a milestone
for gender equality

246
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,560
that we haven't achieved yet:
the Equal Rights Amendment.

247
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,120
It's been
under consideration for a while.

248
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,400
The struggle for an Equal Rights
Amendment traces back to 1923,

249
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,240
when feminist Alice Paul wrote
the words that became E.R.A.

250
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,240
Equality of rights under the law
shall not be denied or abridged

251
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,160
by the US or any state
on account of sex.

252
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,240
That's it. The core of the Equal Rights
Amendment is just 24 words long.

253
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,920
The idea behind it is broadly popular.
According to advocates,

254
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,200
80 percent of us think
it's already in the Constitution.

255
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,960
It's one of those things so obvious,
you assume we already have it.

256
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,360
Like when you see baking
soda at the store.

257
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,800
I don't need to buy baking soda.
I have baking soda. It's a staple.

258
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,600
And then you get home, baking a cake
and you reach in the cupboard,

259
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,800
and you realize: "Fuck, women still
aren't guaranteed equal rights."

260
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,640
There was a time when the E.R.A.
had a lot of momentum,

261
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,160
it sailed through Congress in 1972,
84 senators voting for it,

262
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,880
despite a few
of their colleagues' objections.

263
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,160
Male opponents
called it the "Unisex Amendment".

264
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,920
They said it would destroy traditional
man-woman relationships.

265
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,880
The Senate wasn't swayed and
tonight, after a 49-year struggle,

266
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,600
an amendment appears on the way
proclaiming once and for all

267
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,480
that women have all the same
rights as that other sex.

268
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,520
Wait, "that other sex."
That sounds like what you say

269
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,160
when you've somehow
forgotten the word "men".

270
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,240
Women have the same rights as, what
are they called ? Swollen boys ?

271
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,560
Two-legged horses with jobs ?
Shaved bears who fart ?

272
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,480
Someone help me here, please !

273
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,800
Having passed the House
and the Senate,

274
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,120
the only remaining obstacle
was for 38 states to ratify it.

275
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,520
That is where the holdup has been,
we never crossed that threshold.

276
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,120
We are tantalizingly close. 37 states
have ratified it over the years.

277
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,080
We're just one away. If you live in
one of the states that's holding out,

278
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,960
that can be pretty dispiriting,
as these Florida residents found out.

279
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,800
- Florida is one of the holdouts.
- I'm so tired of living here.

280
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,520
Yeah, of course you are.

281
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,440
Of course you're tired
of living in Florida.

282
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,640
Nothing makes sense there.
The laws, the alligators, the weather.

283
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,440
Everyone in that clip is dressed
for an entirely different season.

284
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,680
Mid-May. Late October.
And September 13th, 1992.

285
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,240
We've never been closer to the E.R.A.
being enshrined in our Constitution.

286
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,480
Six weeks ago, there were even
hearings in Congress on this subject.

287
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,720
It might be a good time to ask why's
it taken so long to pass the E.R.A ?

288
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,240
What would it mean if we did ?
How can we finally get it done ?

289
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,000
Let's start from the beginning.
When Congress passed the E.R.A.,

290
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,320
many saw it as part of an overall
movement toward justice,

291
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,760
as one supporter expressed,
albeit in less than ideal terms.

292
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,840
This is equal rights
for all people of every sex,

293
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,480
every color, every race.

294
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,640
I don't care
if they're homos or what.

295
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:45,320
That speech was a rollercoaster.
So inspirational,

296
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,480
only to fall
at the last second there.

297
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,400
Like Martin Luther King arguing

298
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,600
children should be judged
not by the color of their skin,

299
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,280
but by the content of their character,
even the dirty Catholics.

300
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,600
Dr. King. You really
could've done without that last bit.

301
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,880
The E.R.A. was passed with a deadline
of 1979 to get the 38 states needed.

302
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,400
Initially seemed
it was gonna be no problem.

303
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,080
It was endorsed
by Democrats and Republicans,

304
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,200
including President Nixon,
and 30 states had ratified it.

305
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,960
Hawaii did so just 32 minutes after
Congress approved it.

306
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,200
That's unbelievably fast,
especially considering that,

307
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,600
according to
"WholePigRoast-dot-com",

308
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,560
it can take Hawaiians
12 hours just to roast a pig,

309
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,400
which is, in and of itself,
ridiculous.

310
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,440
I can roast a pig
in just four seconds. I'll show you !

311
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,800
Pig. Your mom fucks pigs. Put an apple
in your mouth, you've been roasted !

312
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,200
I've roasted you, you stupid pig.

313
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,080
All that momentum
came to a crushing halt.

314
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,880
Which many historians credit to
one woman: Phyllis Schlafly.

315
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,640
If you've never heard of her,
congratulations.

316
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,960
She founded a group
called "Stop E.R.A."

317
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,320
and she was all over
the media in the 70s,

318
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,440
spreading fear about the E.R.A.

319
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,560
Some of what she argued it
would do,

320
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,880
like lead to women being included
in the military draft, was possible.

321
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,640
But a lot was bullshit,

322
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,880
like claiming it would outlaw
sex segregated bathrooms.

323
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,680
There was also this nonsense.

324
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,640
Under our system in case
of a break up of marriage,

325
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,320
the mother gets her children,
in most cases.

326
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,240
Who wants to trade that in
for a so-called "equality",

327
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,480
whereby each parent
gets one child ?

328
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,080
I don't think the Equal Rights
Amendment says that each...

329
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,880
In case of a divorce, each
parent gets one child.

330
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,200
You've got to interpret things
equally.

331
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,120
That's right. If one of the children's
better than the other one,

332
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,760
the Amendment says you have
to cut off a little bit of the first one

333
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,080
and give it to the second one,
everything's got to be equal.

334
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,080
So, you've got to give your son
his sister's big toe.

335
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,840
The E.R.A. says that.
That is not what equal rights means.

336
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,760
It's not that everything has to end up
exactly equal, it's just the law

337
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,200
cannot disadvantage you
based on gender.

338
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,480
That didn't matter to Schlafly,
a pre-internet internet troll,

339
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,800
gleefully greeting
audiences with lines like this.

340
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,760
I would like to thank my husband
Fred for letting me come today.

341
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,800
I love to say that, because
it irritates the women's libbers

342
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,600
more than anything that I say.

343
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,720
That "thank you" to Fred is unnecessary
for two reasons:

344
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,360
one, wives are not property
of their husbands.

345
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,400
And two, I'm not sure how
big a sacrifice it was for Fred

346
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,880
to spend a few hours not hanging
out with Phyllis Schlafly.

347
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,440
If I had to guess, Fred was okay
with Phyllis getting out of the house.

348
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,120
The night, even !
I mean, where is this rally ?

349
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,720
If it's more than 10 minutes away,
might make sense to stay over.

350
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,280
If it's any later in the week than,
say, Wednesday, at that point,

351
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,120
just stay the weekend, Phyllis.

352
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,840
No thank you necessary,
don't even mention it,

353
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,920
or anything else,
to Fred ever again.

354
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,760
Schlafly became a major player
in the rise of the religious right,

355
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,120
rallying conservatives to oppose E.R.A.

356
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,480
and one of the most galvanizing
tent poles of their argument

357
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,480
was that the E.R.A.
would expand access to abortion.

358
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,680
When three First Ladies came together
at a pro-E.R.A. women's conference,

359
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,800
Schlafly organized a protest rally,

360
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,480
featuring this ferocious speech from
a Republican congressman.

361
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,480
And the greatest tragedy of all

362
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,480
was to see three former First Ladies
of this nation approving

363
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:30,480
of sexual perversion and the murder
of young people in mothers' wombs.

364
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,440
What a disgrace !

365
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,600
Okay, so that was a lot.

366
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,480
First: the E.R.A. doesn't say anything
about abortion, or other policy.

367
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,320
All it says is that men and women
have to be treated equally.

368
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,320
If your view on abortion requires
that men and women

369
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,120
not be explicitly equal, you may want
to rethink your view on abortion.

370
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,720
If someone stood up at a city
council meeting:

371
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,080
"This law against animal
torture would make it impossible"

372
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,560
"to run my pizza parlor !"

373
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:06,240
Then holy shit, their pizza parlor
never should have existed.

374
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,160
Thanks to arguments like those,
the E.R.A. had become so toxic

375
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,040
that by the 1979 deadline,
only 35 states had ratified it.

376
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,440
Even though Congress extended
the deadline by three years,

377
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,720
not a single
additional state signed on.

378
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,120
I'm not saying that there are not laws
on the books outlawing discrimination.

379
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,720
If you're then wondering:

380
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,840
"If that's the case, why do
we still need the E.R.A. ?"

381
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,600
It's 'cause laws can be rolled back
by a simple act of Congress

382
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,040
and policy guidelines can go away
based on who's in charge.

383
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:43,680
Congress recently let the Violence
Against Women Act expire.

384
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,440
The Trump administration's rescinded
20 policy guidelines

385
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,920
on Title IX antidiscrimination laws.

386
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,400
A constitutional amendment
like the E.R.A. is more stable,

387
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,880
because
are safe from Donald Trump.

388
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,440
Unlike Melania's hopes and dreams
and any American flag he gets close to.

389
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,360
Constitutional amendments are
something he can not easily ruin.

390
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,520
Some would argue that women
have protection under the Constitution,

391
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,200
specifically the 14th Amendment,
which guarantees individuals

392
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,160
equal protections under the law.

393
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,280
Since the 1970s, the Supreme Court
has interpreted that

394
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,320
to cover gender discrimination.

395
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,880
But not everyone agrees that it
should be interpreted that way.

396
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,840
One of those people,
former Justice Antonin Scalia,

397
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:32,560
said the 14th Amendment does not
cover discrimination by gender at all.

398
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,520
Constitution does not require sexual
discrimination on the basis of sex.

399
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,640
The only issue is whether
it prohibits it. It doesn't.

400
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,920
Nobody ever voted for that.

401
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,680
He's right, of course.
If women wanted that amendment

402
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:55,040
to cover gender discrimination,
they should've voted for it in 1868.

403
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,240
Why didn't they do that ?
Silly ladies.

404
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:05,040
Scalia was a die-hard originalist.
And as insane as I personally find

405
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,160
his philosophy of ruling on cases
by jumping inside the long-dead brains

406
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,920
of history's various
misogynists and racists,

407
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,360
there are a lot of people
who think that way.

408
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,200
Trump has promised to put
more of them on the bench,

409
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,960
saying he wants justices "very much
in the mold of Justice Scalia."

410
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,880
Which I can only hope
means dead.

411
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,200
I worry might mean interpreting
the Constitution

412
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,560
without protections for gender.

413
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,520
And that is where
the E.R.A. would come in.

414
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,320
You can't interpret it as not
addressing gender discrimination,

415
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,400
because that's all it addresses.

416
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,920
Our final question: how can we finally,
after all these years,

417
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,360
make the E.R.A.
part of our Constitution ?

418
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,200
Because it is very much possible.
Yes, the deadline passed in 1982.

419
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,040
Legal scholars believe Congress
could change the deadline again

420
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,840
or eliminate it entirely.

421
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,760
Bills to do that have been introduced
in both the House and the Senate

422
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,400
just this year,
with bipartisan co-sponsors.

423
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,120
States have been moving
the E.R.A. forward,

424
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,080
with Nevada and Illinois both
ratifying it in the last years.

425
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,280
For Senator Pat Spearman, who was
behind Nevada's ratification push,

426
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,720
the reasons for doing so
were all too clear.

427
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,560
People who were born in privilege
always debate

428
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,040
whether or not those of us
who were not deserve equality.

429
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,200
What we are talking about here

430
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,560
is the fact that equality
is not debatable.

431
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,440
We are born with it. The only
thing we're asking in the E.R.A.

432
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,480
is to acknowledge the fact
that women are born equal to men.

433
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,520
She's right.
None of this is that complicated.

434
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,080
Equality for women should be
a basic principle of our society.

435
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,960
If you think it already is, great,
all the more reason to write it down.

436
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,000
If you think it isn't, then we
badly need the E.R.A.

437
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,520
I'm not saying
that it will fix everything.

438
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,880
It focuses on discrimination by
the government, not the private sector.

439
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,080
For an issue
like closing the wage gap,

440
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,600
most women would have to
continue to rely on other legislation

441
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,520
and stealing
from male coworkers.

442
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,040
Hashtag #feminism,
Hashtag #ladyfingers.

443
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,480
The E.R.A. could, at the very least,

444
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,760
be a safeguard against things
sliding further backwards.

445
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,600
And we are just one state away,
giving these 13 states

446
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,960
a huge opportunity
to genuinely make history.

447
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,720
One Arizona legislator is inspired
by what this could mean.

448
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,880
If we do this, this goes down
in the history books.

449
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,600
Arizona goes down
in the history books.

450
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,000
Exactly, she's right. Arizona could go
down in the history books.

451
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,600
That just doesn't happen much.
The most famous part of Arizona

452
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,360
is the Grand Canyon,
the part of Arizona where

453
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,600
there's notably less of Arizona.

454
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,640
Anywhere else there'd be
more Arizona there,

455
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,600
but instead there's just
this sudden lack of Arizona

456
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,840
and it's everyone's favorite part.

457
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,800
These 13 states have a huge chance to
change how history views them forever.

458
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,480
So, the only real question here is:

459
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,280
which one of you wants
to seize that chance ?

460
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,840
Which state is gonna put

461
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,000
this amendment over the top and write
themselves into the history books ?

462
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,640
Will it be Arizona ?
Or Georgia ?

463
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,160
Or could it be you, Oklahoma ?
You could be known for something

464
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,560
other than tornados and musicals
about how great morning is.

465
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,040
Which it isn't, it never is. It's just
like night but unpleasantly brighter.

466
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,600
Could it be one of the Carolinas ?
Could it be you, Utah ?

467
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,880
Or you, Missouri ? You could
be famous for making history,

468
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,320
rather than having a state flag that's
2 bears fucking a Christmas ornament.

469
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,720
Or could it be you, Florida ?
Or Mississippi, maybe you could...

470
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,440
Holy shit, Mississippi !
I always forget that's on your flag.

471
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,440
The fuck, Mississippi ?
The actual fuck is that ?

472
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,440
You could pass the E.R.A., but it would
be extremely out of character.

473
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,320
Louisiana ? It could be you !
Arkansas ? It could be you !

474
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,720
Alabama ?
It definitely won't be you.

475
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,160
But Virginia ?
It really could be you.

476
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,480
Plus, you are the birthplace
of Chris Brown, Rick Santorum

477
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,040
and Pat Robertson, so frankly, you
fucking owe America this.

478
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,000
Any one of these 13 states has
an opportunity to bring to an end

479
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,360
a journey that's taken this country
100 years to make.

480
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,840
It's not every day
you get a chance like this

481
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,400
and somebody please do it
before Florida,

482
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,520
I do not want to give them
