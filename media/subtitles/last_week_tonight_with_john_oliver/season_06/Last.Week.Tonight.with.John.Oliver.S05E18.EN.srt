1
00:00:31,244 --> 00:00:34,604
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

2
00:00:34,764 --> 00:00:37,124
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

3
00:00:37,284 --> 00:00:41,363
We are back, and just time
for a quick recap of the week...

4
00:00:41,523 --> 00:00:44,043
a week that saw North Korea
resuming missile launches,

5
00:00:44,203 --> 00:00:47,363
Robert Mueller somehow managing
to irritate all of Congress,

6
00:00:47,523 --> 00:00:50,723
and the president threatening France
with tariffs on their wines

7
00:00:50,882 --> 00:00:53,202
in the dumbest possible way.

8
00:00:53,362 --> 00:00:57,242
I've always liked American wines
better than French wines.

9
00:00:57,402 --> 00:01:02,082
Even though I don't drink wine.
I just like the way they look.

10
00:01:02,242 --> 00:01:05,321
I mean, look,
on one hand, yes, that is stupid.

11
00:01:05,481 --> 00:01:06,921
On the other hand, judging things

12
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:09,801
purely on their looks is
extremely on-brand for Trump.

13
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:11,321
He may as well have said,

14
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:13,401
"I need my wine to be
at least a double D."

15
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:16,321
It would have made exactly
as much sense as that.

16
00:01:16,481 --> 00:01:18,320
But instead of dwelling
on the president,

17
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,440
let's instead turn to Puerto Rico...
objectively the best island

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,520
after, of course, Temptation,

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,360
Love, and kitchen.

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,999
Sorry, Hawaii, until you can display a
knife block and a decorative fruit bowl

21
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,039
while also having hidden storage,
you're not even on my list.

22
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:36,879
Daddy needs his feng shui.

23
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:40,799
There was... there was big news
out of Puerto Rico this week.

24
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,758
<i>The embattled governor of Puerto Rico</i>
<i>finally gives in and steps down.</i>

25
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:47,478
<i>Protests turn into celebration</i>
<i>in the streets.</i>

26
00:01:47,638 --> 00:01:50,958
<i>After hours of delay,</i>
<i>Rosselló finally said the words</i>

27
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,238
<i>these people had been waiting</i>
<i>12 days to hear:</i>

28
00:01:54,398 --> 00:01:56,237
<i>"I will be resigning."</i>

29
00:01:59,757 --> 00:02:04,157
Holy shit. It does not bode well
for your political career

30
00:02:04,317 --> 00:02:06,317
when people are reacting
to your resignation

31
00:02:06,477 --> 00:02:08,557
like Oprah just gave them a car.

32
00:02:08,717 --> 00:02:11,236
"You get a new governor!
You get a new governor!

33
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:14,476
Everybody gets a new governor!"

34
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:17,356
And look, it is hard to overstate

35
00:02:17,516 --> 00:02:19,516
just how historic a moment this was.

36
00:02:19,676 --> 00:02:22,835
Puerto Rico has endured decades
of systemic corruption,

37
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:25,955
a massive debt crisis,
crippling austerity measures,

38
00:02:26,115 --> 00:02:28,395
an inadequate response
to Hurricane Maria,

39
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:30,835
and most recently,
a high-profile probe

40
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:34,275
that saw two former top officials
arrested earlier this month.

41
00:02:34,435 --> 00:02:36,954
But the last straw was this.

42
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:39,834
<i>Governor Ricardo Rosselló</i>
<i>has been under fire</i>

43
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:42,594
<i>since nearly 900 pages</i>
<i>of a private group chat</i>

44
00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:44,114
<i>were leaked and published</i>

45
00:02:44,274 --> 00:02:47,034
<i>by the Center for Investigative</i>
<i>Journalism in Puerto Rico.</i>

46
00:02:47,194 --> 00:02:49,033
<i>The reported messages</i>
<i>between Rosselló</i>

47
00:02:49,193 --> 00:02:53,073
<i>and several close aides include</i>
<i>personal attacks on rival politicians,</i>

48
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:56,273
<i>sexist comments,</i>
<i>and anti-gay slurs.</i>

49
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:58,113
Yeah, that's not good.

50
00:02:58,273 --> 00:03:01,312
Nobody leaks 900 pages
from a group chat

51
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,712
unless there's something
terrible in it,

52
00:03:03,872 --> 00:03:06,352
because otherwise
all group chats are the same.

53
00:03:06,512 --> 00:03:08,992
There's the girl who writes
in full paragraphs,

54
00:03:09,152 --> 00:03:10,832
the guy who says "K,"

55
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:13,592
and inevitably,
the one person apologizing

56
00:03:13,752 --> 00:03:16,471
because they thought this was
the chat Danielle wasn't in,

57
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:19,351
but it turns out it's the group chat
that Danielle was in,

58
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:21,831
and now she knows McKenna
thinks that she's basic.

59
00:03:21,991 --> 00:03:25,271
I mean, Danielle is basic,
but that's not really the point, is it?

60
00:03:25,431 --> 00:03:27,510
And Rosselló's group chat

61
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,870
was very, very, very bad.

62
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,350
It featured the governor calling one
female adversary a "whore"

63
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,110
and an associate of his saying
he was

64
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,270
"salivating to shoot"
the mayor of San Juan,

65
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,629
to which the governor responded,
"You'd be doing me a grand favor."

66
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:43,029
But perhaps the most
devastating text

67
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,829
was a joke about
the dead bodies accumulating

68
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:49,109
during and after Hurricane Maria
at an understaffed morgue.

69
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:52,389
So it's frankly understandable
that people wanted him gone,

70
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:55,948
but I don't think anyone
said it better than this protestor.

71
00:03:56,108 --> 00:03:57,868
After the hurricane,

72
00:03:58,028 --> 00:04:00,668
I was hungry.
I didn't have water.

73
00:04:00,828 --> 00:04:02,548
Like, I didn't have anything.

74
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,308
And then this guy was living it up?

75
00:04:04,468 --> 00:04:07,587
No, bruh, you're not fit
to be governor. Out.

76
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,387
Wow. Well, I mean,
she is not wrong there.

77
00:04:11,547 --> 00:04:13,107
I know this isn't the point,

78
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:16,387
but someone needs to make that woman
the next Bachelorette,

79
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,346
because I would tune in every week

80
00:04:19,506 --> 00:04:21,666
just to watch her look Luke
in the eye and say,

81
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:25,946
"You wanna know what I'm doing in the
fantasy suite? Nah, bruh, you're out.

82
00:04:26,106 --> 00:04:27,546
"You're out.

83
00:04:27,706 --> 00:04:29,866
No, bruh... no."

84
00:04:30,026 --> 00:04:31,346
The...

85
00:04:31,506 --> 00:04:34,185
the protests against Rosselló
were enormous,

86
00:04:34,345 --> 00:04:36,745
with hundreds of thousands
of people on the streets,

87
00:04:36,905 --> 00:04:39,065
some on bicycles,
some underwater,

88
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:42,425
and some even on horseback,
which does seem unfair,

89
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:46,264
since we don't technically know
who the horses support for governor.

90
00:04:46,424 --> 00:04:48,944
You assume you know
what side horses are on,

91
00:04:49,104 --> 00:04:51,104
but you meet one
at a party with a MAGA hat,

92
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:55,064
and you realize, "Whoa! Maybe I don't
know them as well as I thought I did."

93
00:04:55,224 --> 00:04:57,344
Then the horse stops
because you said "whoa,"

94
00:04:57,504 --> 00:04:59,783
and you have to say,
"I didn't mean that 'whoa,'"

95
00:04:59,943 --> 00:05:01,863
but you're still
judging him for the hat.

96
00:05:02,023 --> 00:05:03,903
And yet incredibly,

97
00:05:04,063 --> 00:05:07,103
Rosselló refused to step down
for over a week,

98
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:10,383
even trying to stand his ground
during this testy interview

99
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,342
with Fox News's Shep Smith.

100
00:05:12,502 --> 00:05:15,982
Governor, who's come forward to support
you in the middle of this chaos?

101
00:05:17,622 --> 00:05:21,142
-There are folks who supported me.
-Who, specifically, is supporting you?

102
00:05:21,302 --> 00:05:23,862
There are folks that support
the rule of law.

103
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:26,221
-There are people.
-Could you give me one name?

104
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:28,581
I see them out there;
there is a protest.

105
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:30,741
Well, it's... I've talked to people...

106
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:33,581
-Just one name, Governor.
-From different groups.

107
00:05:33,741 --> 00:05:35,581
A lot of people
from the administration.

108
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:37,301
Governor, you can't
give me the name

109
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,660
of one person in Puerto Rico
who supports you...

110
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,220
Continuing as governor?
Is that correct?

111
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,900
I can. So the mayor of San Sebastián,
for example, supported this effort.

112
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,179
-Whose name is?
-Uh, from different municipalities.

113
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:53,459
Javier Jiménez, for example.

114
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,659
That was excruciating.

115
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:58,939
He took so long
to come up with a name,

116
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:02,099
you might even be thinking that
he just made Javier Jiménez up.

117
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:04,098
Well, in fairness to the governor,

118
00:06:04,258 --> 00:06:07,418
I should say Javier Jiménez is in fact
the mayor of San Sebastián,

119
00:06:07,578 --> 00:06:09,338
but there is one problem,

120
00:06:09,498 --> 00:06:12,218
and I think you can
probably guess it.

121
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:15,298
<i>We spoke to Javier Jiménez</i>
<i>last night via Facetime,</i>

122
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,377
<i>and he says he doesn't support</i>
<i>the governor at all.</i>

123
00:06:20,217 --> 00:06:22,537
<i>I am not supporting him.</i>
<i>Of course not.</i>

124
00:06:22,697 --> 00:06:24,097
<i>That is totally incorrect.</i>

125
00:06:24,257 --> 00:06:25,697
Wow.

126
00:06:25,857 --> 00:06:29,736
So the one name Rosselló
came up with was bullshit,

127
00:06:29,896 --> 00:06:31,936
which is such a stupid mistake.

128
00:06:32,096 --> 00:06:35,016
Why give him a name
they can check in seconds?

129
00:06:35,176 --> 00:06:38,696
When 14-year-olds lie about
having a Canadian girlfriend,

130
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,936
they know to keep the details
vague and untraceable.

131
00:06:42,096 --> 00:06:44,215
They don't say she's Celine Dion

132
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,455
because they'll get found out
immediately.

133
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,935
But finally, on Wednesday,
Governor Rosselló

134
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:51,935
did announce
he'd leave office next week,

135
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:53,855
but it's not clear
what happens next.

136
00:06:54,015 --> 00:06:56,014
The next in line was
the secretary of state.

137
00:06:56,174 --> 00:06:58,734
He was also in the group chat
and has already resigned.

138
00:06:58,894 --> 00:07:01,614
The person in line after that
is the secretary of justice,

139
00:07:01,774 --> 00:07:03,814
who protestors think
is too close to Rosselló

140
00:07:03,974 --> 00:07:05,974
and just announced
she doesn't want the job.

141
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,133
So Puerto Rico's future is unclear,
although I will say this.

142
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:11,613
People there seem
incredibly optimistic.

143
00:07:11,773 --> 00:07:14,773
In fact, Rosselló may have been
a terrible governor,

144
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:18,453
but he may have inadvertently
accomplished something here.

145
00:07:18,613 --> 00:07:22,892
Thank you, Governor,
because you united one island.

146
00:07:23,052 --> 00:07:26,132
The people in Puerto Rico
altogether were able

147
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:29,252
to get him out of the seat
that he was in.

148
00:07:29,412 --> 00:07:31,692
The things that we can do
together now

149
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:34,811
as a whole, you know,
it's totally amazing.

150
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:36,851
Yeah, it is amazing,

151
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:40,291
because in a way, by being
such a spectacular shithead,

152
00:07:40,451 --> 00:07:44,331
Rosselló ended up uniting
Puerto Rico in hating him,

153
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:46,131
and that's an incredible
achievement.

154
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:50,250
But before he thinks for even a second
that what I said constitutes praise,

155
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,130
I'd like to remind you of the words

156
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,730
of one of his island's
greatest philosophers.

157
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:58,210
No, bruh, you're not fit
to be governor. Out.

158
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,289
Exactly.
And now, this.

159
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:08,169
<i>And now, the not-so-secret sadness</i>
<i>of Fox 10 Phoenix's Cory McCloskey.</i>

160
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:11,809
When we were kids, Troy,
it was fun to climb up on a barn

161
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:14,968
and then jump off into a wagon
full of maybe hay

162
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,608
or garbage... whatever.

163
00:08:16,768 --> 00:08:20,048
When I was a kid, we always had
to bust these things in half.

164
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,768
I never got a whole popsicle.

165
00:08:21,928 --> 00:08:23,248
-Never?
-No, never.

166
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:25,248
This is my whole youth:

167
00:08:25,408 --> 00:08:27,487
being whacked in the face
by a snowball.

168
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,407
I grew up in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania.

169
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:32,687
-Really?
-Yeah. Small town called Kennett Square.

170
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:35,007
Kennett Square?
Aw, I lived out that way.

171
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:37,007
I had to live
on the Jersey side, though.

172
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:39,247
Not a lot of cooking went on
in our house.

173
00:08:39,407 --> 00:08:40,726
We prepared meals,

174
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:43,766
but I wouldn't say that my mom
was really a chef.

175
00:08:43,926 --> 00:08:46,726
We all grew up with Crayola,
of course,

176
00:08:46,886 --> 00:08:48,926
and, man, you know who
I always envied?

177
00:08:49,086 --> 00:08:51,926
The kids who had the box
with the sharpener.

178
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:54,525
I was always reduced
to getting a paring knife out

179
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:57,005
to try to shave something
into a point.

180
00:08:57,165 --> 00:08:59,445
I grew up with the world's
smallest bounce houses

181
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,725
at the carnivals
where I used to live,

182
00:09:01,885 --> 00:09:03,445
and they always smelled like...

183
00:09:03,605 --> 00:09:07,444
like a combination
of corn chips and feet.

184
00:09:07,604 --> 00:09:10,484
This is all different.
It's out in the open air.

185
00:09:10,644 --> 00:09:12,044
Nothing can hurt you here.

186
00:09:15,484 --> 00:09:17,164
Moving on.

187
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:19,043
Our main story tonight

188
00:09:19,203 --> 00:09:21,163
concerns the United Kingdom,

189
00:09:21,323 --> 00:09:22,883
home of fascinating wildlife,

190
00:09:23,043 --> 00:09:25,643
like the fearless
mating foxes of Kent,

191
00:09:25,803 --> 00:09:28,443
and beautiful mountains
that go largely unexplored

192
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:31,003
by the carefree
mating foxes of Kent.

193
00:09:31,163 --> 00:09:33,882
It's also home to some of the world's
most gifted artists,

194
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:38,242
like whomever took this picture
of the stoic mating foxes of Kent.

195
00:09:38,402 --> 00:09:41,522
Unfortunately, the UK is about
to be completely fucked,

196
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:45,841
in a way not unlike
the resigned mating foxes of Kent,

197
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:48,601
and the reason for that
is that this week

198
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:51,441
the UK had some very big news.

199
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:53,641
The UK has a new prime minister.

200
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,681
Boris Johnson took over today
from Theresa May,

201
00:09:56,841 --> 00:09:58,320
sealing the transition of power

202
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,120
<i>in a handshake with the queen.</i>

203
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,680
<i>He bowed, then broke the rules</i>

204
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,600
<i>by telling his news staff</i>
<i>what she said.</i>

205
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,840
Exactly, and it was apparently,
and I quote, "Deez nuts."

206
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,119
It's true. She's said it to every
prime minister since Churchill,

207
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,919
and she won't say why.

208
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:17,679
But yes, incredibly,

209
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,239
Britain's new prime minister
is Boris Johnson.

210
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,639
Even if you know nothing
about British politics,

211
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,838
you're probably already
vaguely aware of him.

212
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:27,598
As mayor of London, he famously
got stuck on a zip line

213
00:10:27,758 --> 00:10:30,238
while promoting the 2012 Olympics.

214
00:10:30,398 --> 00:10:33,438
And if you've seen a photo of him,
you'll probably remember it,

215
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:36,958
because it's hard to find one
where he doesn't look ridiculous.

216
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:40,077
In fact,
everything about his appearance

217
00:10:40,237 --> 00:10:42,757
is consistently, immaculately wrong.

218
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:45,357
Here he is wearing a bike helmet

219
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:48,877
that's somehow both too small
and too big for his head.

220
00:10:49,037 --> 00:10:50,516
That's not easy to do.

221
00:10:50,676 --> 00:10:52,556
Here he is looking
like what would happen

222
00:10:52,716 --> 00:10:56,036
if an egg could be both
hairy and sad.

223
00:10:56,196 --> 00:10:57,876
Even his childhood pictures
are funny,

224
00:10:58,036 --> 00:11:01,276
because here he is looking
more like a young Anna Wintour

225
00:11:01,436 --> 00:11:03,915
than I'm guessing she did
at that age.

226
00:11:04,075 --> 00:11:06,755
You may even have seen this clip
that went viral recently

227
00:11:06,915 --> 00:11:10,475
of Boris's endearingly weird answer
to a very simple question

228
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:13,275
about what he does to relax.

229
00:11:13,435 --> 00:11:17,194
I have a thing
where I make models of...

230
00:11:17,354 --> 00:11:21,114
I mean, realizing that we're mayor of
London, we build beautiful... I make...

231
00:11:21,274 --> 00:11:22,634
Buses.

232
00:11:22,794 --> 00:11:24,514
-You make models of buses?
-I do.

233
00:11:24,674 --> 00:11:25,994
So in Downing Street...

234
00:11:26,154 --> 00:11:29,713
So what I do... no, I didn't mean models
of buses. What I make is...

235
00:11:29,873 --> 00:11:34,713
I get... I get old, um...
I don't know, wooden crates.

236
00:11:34,873 --> 00:11:36,233
-Yeah.
-Right?

237
00:11:36,393 --> 00:11:37,713
And then I paint them.

238
00:11:37,873 --> 00:11:40,873
You make cardboard buses.
That's what you do to enjoy yourself.

239
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,752
No, I paint the passengers
enjoying themselves...

240
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:47,872
-Okay, great.
-On the wonderful bus.

241
00:11:48,032 --> 00:11:50,912
Okay. Okay, so... so three things
about that.

242
00:11:51,072 --> 00:11:52,792
One, yes, it's magnificent.

243
00:11:52,952 --> 00:11:54,752
Two, there's just no way
that's true.

244
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:56,591
But three, if it were true,

245
00:11:56,751 --> 00:11:58,511
I now want nothing more than to see

246
00:11:58,671 --> 00:12:00,391
one of those fucking buses,

247
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:03,271
because if they're terrible,
that's weird.

248
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,191
But if they're impressive,
that's somehow weirder.

249
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,590
The very idea
of the new prime minister

250
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,070
painting crate buses
in his spare time to relax

251
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,750
is just endlessly fascinating.

252
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,030
But Boris is so much more

253
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:22,069
than the potential Michelangelo
of vehicular crafts.

254
00:12:22,229 --> 00:12:25,469
He was an absolutely crucial leader
in the Brexit campaign,

255
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:29,229
famously riding around
in a gigantic, red, non-crate bus

256
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:32,229
with a complete lie
splashed across the side of it.

257
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:35,508
And now, he is prime minster
and has to face the challenge

258
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:39,308
of finalizing a Brexit withdrawal deal
by October 31st,

259
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:41,748
which is less than 100 days
from now.

260
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:44,148
And the consequences
of messing that up

261
00:12:44,308 --> 00:12:46,108
could have catastrophic
ramifications

262
00:12:46,268 --> 00:12:48,427
for Britain, Europe, and the world.

263
00:12:48,587 --> 00:12:53,387
So we thought it might be helpful
to explain who exactly Boris Johnson is.

264
00:12:53,547 --> 00:12:56,787
And let's start with the fact that
given that Britain's new leader

265
00:12:56,947 --> 00:12:59,627
is a clownish figure
with silly hair

266
00:12:59,787 --> 00:13:01,786
and a passing relationship
with the truth,

267
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:05,306
you may already be thinking
of the person you're almost always

268
00:13:05,466 --> 00:13:06,906
thinking about anyway.

269
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:08,866
And you are not alone in that.

270
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:12,706
There have been countless headlines
comparing Boris to Donald Trump,

271
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:15,545
and just this week,
Trump did it himself.

272
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:18,225
They're calling him "Britain Trump",

273
00:13:18,385 --> 00:13:21,745
and people are saying that's good,
that they like me over there.

274
00:13:21,905 --> 00:13:24,305
No, they don't.
Nope, they... they don't.

275
00:13:24,465 --> 00:13:25,785
They absolutely do not.

276
00:13:25,945 --> 00:13:30,504
They don't like you over there,
and no one ever says "Britain Trump"

277
00:13:30,664 --> 00:13:32,744
unless it's in the context
of a sentence like,

278
00:13:32,904 --> 00:13:37,104
"I'm getting the fuck out of Britain;
Trump is coming to visit this weekend."

279
00:13:37,264 --> 00:13:41,623
But to call Boris Johnson
"Britain Trump"

280
00:13:41,783 --> 00:13:45,303
is neither exactly wrong
nor exactly right.

281
00:13:45,463 --> 00:13:48,023
Johnson is actually
a lot more complex than Trump

282
00:13:48,183 --> 00:13:49,503
in a number of important ways.

283
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:53,742
For one, while Trump tells you
he has "the best words" but doesn't,

284
00:13:53,902 --> 00:13:57,022
Johnson is more than happy
to show you how erudite he is.

285
00:13:57,182 --> 00:13:59,862
Just watch him charmingly drop
some sporting trivia

286
00:14:00,022 --> 00:14:01,742
ahead of the London Olympics.

287
00:14:01,902 --> 00:14:05,741
Ping-pong was invented on
the dining tables of England,

288
00:14:05,901 --> 00:14:07,941
ladies and gentlemen,
in the 19th century.

289
00:14:08,101 --> 00:14:10,861
It was, and it was called
"whiff-whaff."

290
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:12,941
And there you have
the essential difference

291
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:14,701
between us
and the rest of the world.

292
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:17,301
Other nations, the French,
looked at a dining table

293
00:14:17,461 --> 00:14:19,660
and saw an opportunity
to have dinner.

294
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,260
We looked at a dining table

295
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,180
and saw an opportunity
to play whiff-whaff.

296
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,020
Look, look, yes.

297
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,380
I will admit
that is objectively funny,

298
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,380
although I'm not sure
that that whiff-whaff anecdote

299
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,259
reflects quite as well
on the British

300
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:34,739
as he's implying there.

301
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:37,139
The French looked to the dining table
as a canvas

302
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:39,219
upon which to create
exceptional cuisine,

303
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,739
and the British saw a way to
basically invent mouse tennis.

304
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:46,818
And look, Johnson is more than happy
to look ridiculous.

305
00:14:46,978 --> 00:14:51,498
It's enabled him to not just survive
when he fucks up, but actually benefit.

306
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:53,738
That absurd zip line photo
from the Olympics

307
00:14:53,898 --> 00:14:56,338
would have killed
most politicians' careers,

308
00:14:56,498 --> 00:15:00,057
but Boris found a way to laugh
at himself and charm everyone.

309
00:15:00,217 --> 00:15:02,817
Just watch how it got covered
on the news at the time.

310
00:15:02,977 --> 00:15:04,297
<i>Isn't that fantastic?</i>

311
00:15:04,457 --> 00:15:08,017
<i>This is a man who some are tipping</i>
<i>as a future prime minister.</i>

312
00:15:08,177 --> 00:15:10,697
<i>Look, I think if anyone</i>
<i>has won the Olympics,</i>

313
00:15:10,856 --> 00:15:12,896
<i>I would say it's Boris Johnson.</i>

314
00:15:13,056 --> 00:15:14,976
Hold on.
Hold on there.

315
00:15:15,136 --> 00:15:17,256
"If" anyone won the Olympics?

316
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,216
To be clear, people definitely
won the Olympics,

317
00:15:20,376 --> 00:15:21,936
specifically the winners.

318
00:15:22,096 --> 00:15:24,495
The winners won the Olympics.

319
00:15:24,655 --> 00:15:26,175
And in a nutshell,

320
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:28,615
that has been the root
of Boris's appeal...

321
00:15:28,775 --> 00:15:31,015
a loveable mess weathering adversity

322
00:15:31,175 --> 00:15:32,815
with humor and good cheer.

323
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:34,735
But the truth is,

324
00:15:34,895 --> 00:15:37,134
there may be a great deal
more calculation

325
00:15:37,294 --> 00:15:39,134
behind that image
than first appears,

326
00:15:39,294 --> 00:15:40,894
because Boris learned
at an early age

327
00:15:41,054 --> 00:15:43,534
the benefits of making yourself
the butt of the joke,

328
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,814
as his own sister remembers.

329
00:15:45,974 --> 00:15:48,254
<i>He discovered he could</i>
<i>make people laugh.</i>

330
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,653
When he was in a French play,

331
00:15:50,813 --> 00:15:54,013
he had to recite Molière and he hadn't
bothered to learn his lines,

332
00:15:54,173 --> 00:15:56,173
and he hid behind a pillow
reading them out,

333
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:59,653
which was obviously much funnier
than if he'd learnt them perfectly

334
00:15:59,813 --> 00:16:03,332
and had stood on the stage
and declaimed them.

335
00:16:03,492 --> 00:16:05,612
Yeah, obviously.

336
00:16:05,772 --> 00:16:08,212
It's always funnier
when things go wrong,

337
00:16:08,372 --> 00:16:12,212
like in this photo of Johnson shaking
hands with the queen... Oh, no.

338
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,972
Oh, what an embarrassing mistake.

339
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:17,051
See? Objectively funnier.

340
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:21,811
And by the way, how are neither
of you into this?

341
00:16:21,971 --> 00:16:26,651
Boris... Boris actually learned
a great deal from that incident

342
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:28,611
as he himself will admit.

343
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:31,690
Do you think that you learnt
something for later life

344
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,610
from acting in plays at Eton?

345
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,450
You could actually get more laughs

346
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,970
by looking as if
you don't know your lines

347
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,410
than actually remembering them.

348
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,449
Well, I certainly think that

349
00:16:42,609 --> 00:16:45,289
as a general tactic in life,

350
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:47,529
if that's what you're driving at,

351
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:51,809
it is often useful...

352
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,329
to give the slight impression

353
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:58,328
that you are deliberately pretending
not to know what is going on.

354
00:16:58,488 --> 00:17:01,128
The reality may be that you
don't know what is going on,

355
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:02,968
but people can't tell the difference.

356
00:17:03,128 --> 00:17:07,488
And that, right there,
is the key to Boris Johnson,

357
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:10,687
presenting his own lack
of preparation so charmingly

358
00:17:10,847 --> 00:17:13,167
that you actually doubt
he's unprepared,

359
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:15,207
but he is.

360
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,887
It's an incredibly powerful trick,
and incidentally, it's clips like that

361
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:22,406
that are one major reason
why Boris is not the Britain Trump,

362
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:26,446
because can you imagine Trump
having that level of self-reflection?

363
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:30,726
"Look, with 'covfefe,'
the tactic was to present myself

364
00:17:30,886 --> 00:17:32,806
"as a kind of sub-literate clown

365
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:36,445
"and to distract you from the fact
that I'm a mound of skin

366
00:17:36,605 --> 00:17:38,645
"tautly stretched
across the howling chasm

367
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:40,525
of the space
where a soul should be."

368
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:45,725
That's... it's a very useful tool
when deployed well.

369
00:17:45,885 --> 00:17:47,284
The point here is, though,

370
00:17:47,444 --> 00:17:50,724
Johnson's bumbling persona
is a carefully calibrated act.

371
00:17:50,884 --> 00:17:55,924
Take his hair. Multiple people have said
he actually messes it up on purpose.

372
00:17:56,084 --> 00:17:57,444
A BBC producer tweeted

373
00:17:57,604 --> 00:17:59,044
that "he'd always ruffle it

374
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:01,043
right before the camera
started rolling,"

375
00:18:01,203 --> 00:18:02,883
which kind of makes sense,
doesn't it?

376
00:18:03,043 --> 00:18:05,283
He's been on TV hundreds of times,

377
00:18:05,443 --> 00:18:07,603
and he always looks like a mess.

378
00:18:07,763 --> 00:18:10,883
What were the chances that
before every one of those appearances,

379
00:18:11,043 --> 00:18:14,642
he combed, gelled,
and carefully part his hair

380
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,962
only to then be hit in the face
by a goose

381
00:18:18,122 --> 00:18:19,762
right as they started filming?

382
00:18:19,922 --> 00:18:23,282
No, he looks like that
because he wants to.

383
00:18:23,442 --> 00:18:27,841
Or take his clothing. He's often seen
outside in eccentric, chaotic outfits,

384
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:29,881
but he knows how to dress.

385
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,641
He just also knows that
that is a more relatable image

386
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:35,841
than this one from when he was
in the notoriously elite

387
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:38,241
Bullingdon Club at Oxford University

388
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:40,000
with his friend David Cameron.

389
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,680
Now, that photo was
a huge liability for Cameron

390
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,240
but not for Johnson,

391
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,360
because he's cleverly
inoculated himself

392
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,760
against that image
of astonishing privilege

393
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,679
by presenting himself
as a cartoon Englishman

394
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,799
who dresses like a raccoon
who just emerged

395
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:57,559
from David Foster Wallace's trash.

396
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:01,719
And once you realize what he is doing,
it makes you question everything

397
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:04,119
that you previously found
charming about him.

398
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:07,158
Remember that clip where he's
talking about painting buses?

399
00:19:07,318 --> 00:19:08,678
Undeniably funny,

400
00:19:08,838 --> 00:19:12,358
but some in Britain have pointed out
that it might have been an attempt

401
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,838
to change the Google search results
people receive

402
00:19:14,998 --> 00:19:17,638
when they looked for something like
"Boris Johnson bus,"

403
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:20,117
meaning that people would see
that delightful clip

404
00:19:20,277 --> 00:19:23,237
rather than this significantly
less delightful bullshit.

405
00:19:23,397 --> 00:19:25,477
Now, was that actually
his intention?

406
00:19:25,637 --> 00:19:29,517
It's impossible to know,
but you can't rule it out either.

407
00:19:29,677 --> 00:19:31,556
And once you see the possibility

408
00:19:31,716 --> 00:19:34,676
that his gaffes are in fact
calculated manipulations,

409
00:19:34,836 --> 00:19:36,516
you can't unsee it.

410
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:40,716
It's like looking at the FedEx logo
and finally noticing the arrow.

411
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:42,196
Or...

412
00:19:42,356 --> 00:19:44,076
Or looking at the Starbucks logo

413
00:19:44,236 --> 00:19:46,515
and finally noticing
Robert De Niro's face.

414
00:19:46,675 --> 00:19:51,555
You can never look at it
in quite the same way again.

415
00:19:51,715 --> 00:19:54,035
And beneath all of
Boris's surface charm

416
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:56,435
are some truly nasty elements.

417
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,474
For one thing, he is a liar.

418
00:19:58,634 --> 00:20:00,834
He was fired from his first job
as a journalist,

419
00:20:00,994 --> 00:20:04,034
at "The Times" of London
for completely making up a quote.

420
00:20:04,194 --> 00:20:08,034
In fact, his editor claims
Johnson was the "single worst employee"

421
00:20:08,194 --> 00:20:09,634
he's ever had,

422
00:20:09,794 --> 00:20:13,993
"and skipped many work days to hang out
with his best friend, Jeffrey Epstein,"

423
00:20:14,153 --> 00:20:15,593
which is terrible.

424
00:20:15,753 --> 00:20:18,753
It's not true;
I just made that quote up.

425
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:22,233
But now, you can see
just how irresponsible it is

426
00:20:22,393 --> 00:20:24,432
to fabricate them.

427
00:20:24,592 --> 00:20:28,432
And from there, Johnson failed upwards
to a job at "The Daily Telegraph,"

428
00:20:28,592 --> 00:20:31,592
where he built a following
on a series of flagrant falsehoods

429
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:34,472
about the European Union
as their Brussels correspondent...

430
00:20:34,632 --> 00:20:36,991
falsehoods that would help
lay the groundwork

431
00:20:37,151 --> 00:20:39,351
for the Brexit vote decades later.

432
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:42,791
Johnson even admits that he had
something called a "save-get."

433
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:46,591
It's a key command like a copy-paste
of a phrase that he liked to use

434
00:20:46,751 --> 00:20:49,271
to paint a caricature of the EU.

435
00:20:49,431 --> 00:20:53,550
I had a sort of "save-get."
Do you still have "save-get" keys?

436
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,310
A "save-get" kind of intro,

437
00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:00,150
which was "Britain stood alone
last night as..."

438
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:04,149
and then I'd fill in whatever it was,
"As Europe proceeded with plans

439
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:06,629
to abolish the prawn cocktail
flavor crisp,"

440
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:08,909
or... or whatever.

441
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:12,029
Okay.
So, first, for those unfamiliar,

442
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:14,029
prawn cocktail crisps are real.

443
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,068
They shouldn't be, but they are.

444
00:21:16,228 --> 00:21:18,828
And to explain,
it's what happens when a country

445
00:21:18,988 --> 00:21:21,868
looks at a dining table
and foregoes food

446
00:21:22,028 --> 00:21:25,988
in favor of playing whiff-whaff,
but Johnson...

447
00:21:26,148 --> 00:21:29,387
Johnson actually did write
a series of columns

448
00:21:29,547 --> 00:21:32,627
claiming Europe was attempting to ban
the prawn cocktail crisp,

449
00:21:32,787 --> 00:21:34,507
which was a complete lie.

450
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,867
Europe was never planning
to abolish them,

451
00:21:37,027 --> 00:21:39,227
and they immediately
pointed that out.

452
00:21:39,387 --> 00:21:42,826
But Boris's allegation
spread like wildfire

453
00:21:42,986 --> 00:21:45,786
and became a popular example
of an out-of-control EU,

454
00:21:45,946 --> 00:21:48,026
and as recently as 2016,

455
00:21:48,186 --> 00:21:52,706
a full 25 years after his bullshit
was completely debunked,

456
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:55,025
Boris actually cited "the great war

457
00:21:55,185 --> 00:21:57,345
against the British
prawn cocktail crisp"

458
00:21:57,505 --> 00:21:59,185
as part of his case for Brexit.

459
00:21:59,345 --> 00:22:01,865
And by the way,
if there ever is a great war

460
00:22:02,025 --> 00:22:05,145
against the prawn cocktail crisp,
there will be no winners.

461
00:22:05,305 --> 00:22:07,305
Believe me, because...

462
00:22:07,465 --> 00:22:10,024
I will say this.
Eating them...

463
00:22:12,144 --> 00:22:15,944
It's... it's like eating
a cremated mermaid.

464
00:22:16,104 --> 00:22:18,824
But... but in a bad way.

465
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:20,704
And...

466
00:22:20,863 --> 00:22:23,183
Oh, that's bad.
And look, look...

467
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:29,703
Look, look, it would be bad enough
if Boris were just a liar.

468
00:22:29,863 --> 00:22:33,862
He's also been more than willing to tap
into outright bigotry to get ahead.

469
00:22:34,022 --> 00:22:36,222
He's made repeated references
to some immigrants

470
00:22:36,382 --> 00:22:38,542
as people that want
to "leech off the state,"

471
00:22:38,702 --> 00:22:41,422
and over the years he's made
references to "piccaninnies."

472
00:22:41,582 --> 00:22:44,662
He said the people of Congo
had "watermelon smiles,"

473
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:47,821
he's called gay men
"tank-topped bumboys,"

474
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:50,661
and just last year, there was this.

475
00:22:50,821 --> 00:22:52,581
<i>"They look like letterboxes,"</i>

476
00:22:52,741 --> 00:22:54,581
<i>Boris Johnson wrote on Monday.</i>

477
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,821
<i>He even compared women who wear them</i>

478
00:22:56,981 --> 00:22:58,461
<i>to bank robbers.</i>

479
00:22:58,621 --> 00:23:01,020
That is an appalling comment

480
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,980
that leaves a truly disgusting
taste in your mouth,

481
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,820
much like the shrimp crisp dust

482
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,700
that has very much voted
to remain on my fucking tongue.

483
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,819
And look, when reporters camped
outside Johnson's house,

484
00:23:14,979 --> 00:23:18,419
he really turned the cartoon
version of himself up to 11,

485
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:21,539
ruffling up his hair,
donning an absurd outfit,

486
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:23,179
and waddling out to charm them,

487
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:25,978
and just watch how
depressingly effective

488
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,658
it winds up being.

489
00:23:27,818 --> 00:23:30,498
-Do you apologize for what...
-Will you have a cup of tea?

490
00:23:30,658 --> 00:23:32,698
-Will you apologize...
-Would you like a cup?

491
00:23:32,858 --> 00:23:34,418
-Yeah, sure.
-Go on. Have a cuppa.

492
00:23:34,578 --> 00:23:36,738
Thank you, thank you.
Do you regret...

493
00:23:36,898 --> 00:23:39,257
-Would you like a cup?
-Do you regret your comment?

494
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,977
-Do you regret your comment?
-Go on, have a cup of tea.

495
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:44,337
-Thank you very much.
-There you go.

496
00:23:44,497 --> 00:23:46,497
-There you go.
-Do you regret your comment?

497
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:48,337
I want you
to have a cup of tea.

498
00:23:48,497 --> 00:23:50,897
If I have a cup of tea,
will you answer my question?

499
00:23:51,057 --> 00:23:54,296
No, I'm here solely
on a humanitarian mission.

500
00:23:54,456 --> 00:23:57,296
You've been here all day,
and you've been incredibly patient

501
00:23:57,456 --> 00:23:59,136
and incredibly...
I feel sorry for you,

502
00:23:59,296 --> 00:24:02,336
'cause I have nothing to say,
except offer you some tea!

503
00:24:02,496 --> 00:24:04,376
-Okay.
-Okay? Go on.

504
00:24:04,536 --> 00:24:06,855
-Okay, thank you. Thank you so much.
-Go on.

505
00:24:07,015 --> 00:24:08,535
No!

506
00:24:08,695 --> 00:24:10,215
Don't take the tea,

507
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,015
and do not thank him for it!

508
00:24:12,175 --> 00:24:14,295
Because think about
what just happened there.

509
00:24:14,455 --> 00:24:16,895
He referred to Muslim women
as letterboxes,

510
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,734
and in the space of 30 seconds,

511
00:24:18,894 --> 00:24:20,494
he had them laughing along
with them.

512
00:24:20,654 --> 00:24:23,134
He was in trouble,
he put on full Brit face,

513
00:24:23,294 --> 00:24:25,374
and those journalists
fucking fell for it.

514
00:24:25,534 --> 00:24:27,654
And for the record,
I can say Brit face.

515
00:24:27,814 --> 00:24:29,174
You can't.

516
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,693
I can definitely say it.

517
00:24:31,853 --> 00:24:34,053
We can say it together;
you can't say it at all.

518
00:24:34,213 --> 00:24:35,613
That's the rule.

519
00:24:35,773 --> 00:24:38,733
But unfortunately,
Boris the prime minister

520
00:24:38,893 --> 00:24:41,573
may have hit the limits
of where that charm can take him,

521
00:24:41,733 --> 00:24:45,252
because crucially,
he now has less than 100 days

522
00:24:45,412 --> 00:24:46,852
to negotiate a Brexit deal.

523
00:24:47,012 --> 00:24:49,932
And his well-engineered,
clumsy Brit persona

524
00:24:50,092 --> 00:24:52,012
does not necessarily travel well.

525
00:24:52,172 --> 00:24:54,412
We saw that during his time
as foreign secretary.

526
00:24:54,572 --> 00:24:57,771
In 2017, he was in Myanmar,
where for some reason

527
00:24:57,931 --> 00:24:59,851
he kept muttering Rudyard Kipling's

528
00:25:00,011 --> 00:25:03,211
colonialist poem "Mandalay"
to himself.

529
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,970
Oh, yeah.

530
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,890
<i>The ambassador is quick to spot</i>

531
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,530
<i>that reminding their hosts</i>
<i>of British rule</i>

532
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,689
<i>might not be wise.</i>

533
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:38,408
Is it good stuff?
Or is that actually bad stuff?

534
00:25:38,568 --> 00:25:40,808
'Cause I'd argue,
as a foreign secretary,

535
00:25:40,968 --> 00:25:42,488
it's best not to remind people

536
00:25:42,648 --> 00:25:45,968
of when your country subjugated theirs
for more than a century.

537
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:48,688
It honestly would've been
more diplomatic at that point

538
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:53,327
to recite the lyrics to
"My neck, My Back", by Khia.

539
00:25:53,487 --> 00:25:55,047
"My neck, my back,

540
00:25:55,207 --> 00:25:57,207
lick my pussy and my crack."

541
00:25:57,367 --> 00:25:59,407
Good stuff, good stuff.

542
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:01,687
And look, that...

543
00:26:01,847 --> 00:26:03,526
that wasn't a one-off.

544
00:26:03,686 --> 00:26:06,966
Johnson's time in the foreign office
was littered with gaffes,

545
00:26:07,126 --> 00:26:10,406
as this journalist explains
with the help of a visual aid.

546
00:26:10,566 --> 00:26:12,126
I've spoken to one figure

547
00:26:12,286 --> 00:26:14,406
who said that working
with Boris Johnson

548
00:26:14,566 --> 00:26:17,525
is like walking a few feet
behind a horse

549
00:26:17,685 --> 00:26:19,445
shoveling its shit.

550
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:24,245
Wow. That is a striking quote,

551
00:26:24,405 --> 00:26:26,605
although I'm not really sure
why that journalist

552
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:29,484
felt the need to be
next to a horse to deliver it.

553
00:26:29,644 --> 00:26:31,524
How do you pitch that
to the stable owner?

554
00:26:31,684 --> 00:26:35,204
"Look, I'm just worried that people
have forgotten what horses look like,

555
00:26:35,364 --> 00:26:39,644
"so please stand aside while I humiliate
your animal on the news."

556
00:26:39,804 --> 00:26:43,363
And the problem is, if Johnson messes up
the Brexit negotiation,

557
00:26:43,523 --> 00:26:46,603
the pile-up of shit
could be considerable here,

558
00:26:46,763 --> 00:26:49,123
as most economists believe
a no-deal Brexit

559
00:26:49,283 --> 00:26:50,883
would cause a deep recession.

560
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:54,482
And the EU may be extra immune
to Boris's charms.

561
00:26:54,642 --> 00:26:57,602
Remember, he was a key figure
in the Brexit campaign

562
00:26:57,762 --> 00:27:01,202
and has lied about them for decades
in his newspaper columns,

563
00:27:01,362 --> 00:27:04,642
on top of which he has privately
referred to the French as "turds"

564
00:27:04,802 --> 00:27:07,561
and publicly compared
the EU to Hitler.

565
00:27:07,721 --> 00:27:09,161
So he's not working

566
00:27:09,321 --> 00:27:11,281
with a lot of goodwill
at this point.

567
00:27:11,441 --> 00:27:14,641
And Boris has made extravagant,
unkeepable promises,

568
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,041
including that he will somehow
devise a way

569
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:19,561
to sever northern Ireland
from the EU

570
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,160
without creating a hard border
with Ireland.

571
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,840
But his suggestions cannot work,

572
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,760
and EU Commissioner
Jean-Claude Juncker

573
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,480
has responded
pretty clearly to them.

574
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,160
<i>Juncker reiterated</i>
<i>that "the EU's position</i>

575
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,799
<i>"that the Withdrawal Agreement is</i>
<i>the best and only agreement possible."</i>

576
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:39,439
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>Juncker said no to Johnson.</i>

577
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:41,359
Yeah, of course he did,

578
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,039
so Johnson is shit out of luck
at this point.

579
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:47,998
His bumbling charm may work wonders
in low-stakes situations,

580
00:27:48,158 --> 00:27:49,878
but that's not where he is now.

581
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:54,558
Think of it like this. Hugh Grant is
delightful in romantic comedies...

582
00:27:54,718 --> 00:27:56,518
the stammering, the hesitation,

583
00:27:56,678 --> 00:27:58,918
the inability to relate
to his surroundings

584
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:01,077
with any level of competence.

585
00:28:01,237 --> 00:28:04,397
You want to see Hugh Grant in
"Four Weddings and a Funeral,"

586
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:07,797
but no one wants to see him
in "United 93,"

587
00:28:07,957 --> 00:28:11,597
because the context would make
his character a lot less charming.

588
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:13,436
"Sorry, I just... um, well,

589
00:28:13,596 --> 00:28:15,796
"ah, this is a...
really a stupid question,

590
00:28:15,956 --> 00:28:18,956
"Particularly
in view of your recent jihad,

591
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:23,036
"but I just wondered if by any chance,
in the words of David Cassidy,

592
00:28:23,196 --> 00:28:25,356
"when he was still with
'The Partridge Family,'

593
00:28:25,516 --> 00:28:27,395
"I believe, uh,
you might be persuaded to,

594
00:28:27,555 --> 00:28:29,435
should Allah will it, obviously..."

595
00:28:29,595 --> 00:28:33,595
"Land-land-land this plane. Um...

596
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:36,955
Allahu, as I believe
you say it, Akbar."

597
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:40,674
Because...
yeah, it's less good.

598
00:28:40,834 --> 00:28:44,794
It's less good in a situation
that matters,

599
00:28:44,954 --> 00:28:49,114
because Johnson cannot get what
he wants or has promised here,

600
00:28:49,274 --> 00:28:51,953
and his only hope of avoiding
complete catastrophe

601
00:28:52,113 --> 00:28:54,753
is through focus, discipline,
and detail.

602
00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:58,153
But those are three Achilles heels
of his. I'll show you.

603
00:28:58,313 --> 00:29:02,473
One of his great plans for mitigating
the potentially catastrophic effects

604
00:29:02,633 --> 00:29:07,032
of a no-deal Brexit is to suggest that
if the UK misses that October deadline,

605
00:29:07,192 --> 00:29:11,952
it could simply trade freely with the EU
under Article 24, paragraph 5B

606
00:29:12,112 --> 00:29:13,992
of this existing trade agreement,

607
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:17,032
but... and you do not need
to know the details of this...

608
00:29:17,192 --> 00:29:19,791
the very next paragraph, 5C,

609
00:29:19,951 --> 00:29:22,191
makes it clear that
that is simply not possible.

610
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:25,151
And just watch as a journalist
who actually understood that

611
00:29:25,311 --> 00:29:26,951
challenged Johnson on it.

612
00:29:27,111 --> 00:29:30,151
You talk about Article 5B
in paragraph 24.

613
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:31,950
Paragraph 5B. Article 24.

614
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,430
-Get the detail right, Andrew.
-Article 5...

615
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,670
It's Article 24, paragraph 5B.

616
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,950
And how would you handle
paragraph 5C?

617
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:45,069
I would... I would confide entirely
in paragraph 5B, because that is...

618
00:29:45,229 --> 00:29:47,229
But how would you get around
what's in 5C?

619
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:50,829
I'd confide entirely in paragraph 5B,
which is enough for our purposes.

620
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,789
-Do you know what's in 5C?
-No.

621
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:57,548
Oh, for fuck's sake!

622
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:00,228
That "no" was delivered
with the confidence of a man

623
00:30:00,388 --> 00:30:03,828
who doesn't know what he's talking
about, but thinks it doesn't matter.

624
00:30:03,988 --> 00:30:06,948
It's a "no" that says, "Yeah,
I'm full of shit. So what?

625
00:30:07,108 --> 00:30:11,467
"Just walk a few feet behind me
and clean it up with a shovel."

626
00:30:11,627 --> 00:30:16,387
But that lack of attention to detail
for a process that has the potential

627
00:30:16,547 --> 00:30:19,387
to impact millions of people
is really alarming,

628
00:30:19,547 --> 00:30:21,947
and there is no reason
for much hope here,

629
00:30:22,107 --> 00:30:25,626
because all the skills that have helped
Johnson to become prime minister

630
00:30:25,786 --> 00:30:28,066
will not paper over
all of the deficits

631
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,546
that are going to make him
terrible at that job.

632
00:30:30,706 --> 00:30:32,546
Johnson has backed himself
into a corner,

633
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,866
because Parliament has rejected
the EU's deal;

634
00:30:35,026 --> 00:30:37,665
the EU says there is
no better deal to be had.

635
00:30:37,825 --> 00:30:40,105
There is really no good way
out of this,

636
00:30:40,265 --> 00:30:42,185
meaning that
he's pretty much stranded...

637
00:30:42,345 --> 00:30:44,025
and not the charming kind
of stranded

638
00:30:44,185 --> 00:30:47,065
that means you've somehow
won the Olympics,

639
00:30:47,225 --> 00:30:50,944
because this time that zip line
isn't over Olympic spectators.

640
00:30:51,104 --> 00:30:52,464
It's over a volcano.

641
00:30:52,624 --> 00:30:55,024
It's set to erupt
in three months' time,

642
00:30:55,184 --> 00:30:57,224
and the only people
who can help get him down

643
00:30:57,384 --> 00:31:00,224
are the same people he's accused
of being turds and Hitlers.

644
00:31:00,384 --> 00:31:03,383
And unfortunately for Johnson,
Britain, Europe, and the world,

645
00:31:03,543 --> 00:31:08,303
I just don't think he's gonna be able
to whiff-whaff his way out of this one.

646
00:31:08,463 --> 00:31:10,543
And now, this.

647
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:15,902
<i>And now, CNBC's Joe Kernen</i>
<i>irritates his co-workers.</i>

648
00:31:16,062 --> 00:31:18,702
Rami Malek's teeth... those fake teeth

649
00:31:18,862 --> 00:31:21,662
actually won Best Actor, I think.

650
00:31:21,822 --> 00:31:24,062
Did they not, or...?

651
00:31:24,222 --> 00:31:26,182
Uh, no, I think they did not.

652
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,902
-You're not a baby powder guy?
-No.

653
00:31:28,061 --> 00:31:29,941
Baby skin.
If you get a little bit older...

654
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:31,901
-I have it already.
-Get a bit older,

655
00:31:32,061 --> 00:31:34,341
-...gravity takes over.
-The baby powder...

656
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:36,421
-Gravity takes over?
-Eventually.

657
00:31:36,581 --> 00:31:38,941
Is that what you want to tell
Americans at 6:08?

658
00:31:39,101 --> 00:31:40,781
It's just a fact, right, Mac?

659
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:42,820
There are big...
specific type of sweat...

660
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,860
-Ugh. So gross.
-Glands in your ear canal, Andrew.

661
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,100
-Really...
-Active. Active ones.

662
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,580
-It's spectacular.
-It's fast.

663
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,620
It's real. They're real,
and they're spectacular.

664
00:31:54,859 --> 00:31:57,939
-Nice.
-Yeah, like he said.

665
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,939
You're glued
to what's-his-face, with the...

666
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:04,939
big Austin Powers dude
with the teeth, um...

667
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:07,059
-Mike Myers?
-No.

668
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:10,938
Uh, the guy who summarizes a week
in a day on Sunday nights...

669
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:13,378
-Oh, John Oliver.
-Yeah, yeah.

670
00:32:13,538 --> 00:32:14,938
