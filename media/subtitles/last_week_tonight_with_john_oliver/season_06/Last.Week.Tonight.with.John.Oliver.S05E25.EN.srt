LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,010
SEASON VI
EPISODE 25

3
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,200
Welcome to Last Week Tonight!

4
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,120
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

5
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,080
Let's dive in with a week that was once
again consumed by Stupid Watergate II,

6
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,210
something that features everything
that was bad about the original,

7
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,060
while still somehow
managing to be worse.

8
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,160
It's basically the Diet Mountain Dew
of political scandals.

9
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,160
This week saw Trump
try to shift the narrative

10
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,200
away from the allegations
surrounding him

11
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,030
to conspiracies
surrounding the Biden family,

12
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,070
although in doing so,
he hit some ridiculous roadblocks.

13
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,500
The president is amping up
his accusations on social media.

14
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,340
Tweeting out a video
slamming the Bidens

15
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,400
featuring music
from the rock group "Nickelback"

16
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,320
only to be shut down by Twitter

17
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,390
after the band complained
that was a copyright violation.

18
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,340
It's true.

19
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,420
Twitter removed one of the president's
memes 'cause Nickelback complained.

20
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,350
And that's a sentence
that somehow suggests the news

21
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,380
is being written by an algorithm
designed to generate random shittiness.

22
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,390
"Twitter took down Trump's meme;
And now for the weather,

23
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:39,330
where it will be raining expired
ranch dressing, rats, and bedbugs,

24
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,380
all in honor
of Guy Fieri's birthday.

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,480
Thanks for watching,
I'm Roman Polanksi."

26
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,340
And if that wasn't sufficiently stupid,
the very next day,

27
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,350
during Trump's customary
"screaming next to a helicopter" time,

28
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,380
he decided to answer a question about
what he wanted Ukraine to do like this.

29
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,290
They should investigate the Bidens,

30
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,460
likewise, China should start
an investigation into the Bidens,

31
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,020
because what happened in China

32
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:12,000
is just about as bad
as what happened with Ukraine.

33
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:17,000
I would say that President Zelensky,
if it were me,

34
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,040
I would recommend that they start
an investigation into the Bidens.

35
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,150
Holy shit!

36
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,130
Instead of denying that he privately
solicited dirt from a foreign power,

37
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,230
he publicly did it,

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,040
and then asked another foreign power
to get involved, too.

39
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,130
Which is just making it worse.
You almost expect his next words to be:

40
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,120
"Biden's not as bad as Jeffrey Epstein,
but no problem, I had him killed.

41
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,060
So sad, great guy.

42
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,070
The killer too-paid the guards,
used a bed sheet, he's outta there.

43
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,030
Wonderful extrajudicial murder."

44
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,090
It is bad enough

45
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,180
that Trump seems fixated on a rightwing
conspiracy theory about the Bidens.

46
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,060
But what makes it far worse
is the extent

47
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,090
to which he's abused the power
of the presidency to pursue that belief.

48
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,210
Text messages emerged,
showing a career diplomat Bill Taylor,

49
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,060
objecting to Trump
withholding aid from Ukraine

50
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,860
unless they investigated
the Bidens.

51
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,050
He apparently texted his concerns
to Gordon Sondland,

52
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:20,010
Trump's ambassador to the EU, and
the response he got was not reassuring.

53
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,960
Taylor wrote, quote:

54
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,880
"Are we saying that security assistance
and a White House meeting

55
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,940
are conditioned on investigations?"

56
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,850
Sondland responded: "Call me".

57
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,020
"Call me".
That is not a good response.

58
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,930
It would've been less damning
if Sondland had added:

59
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,020
"Because I'm horny."

60
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,950
"And I want you to talk me off.
Even though I'm your boss.

61
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,080
That's the misconduct I'm engaged in
right now. Not anything else."

62
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,050
Eggplant emoji.

63
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:57,060
And that wasn't the only time
Sondland brushed off Taylor's concerns.

64
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,990
In a text last month he wrote:

65
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,980
"It's crazy to withhold
security assistance

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
for help
with a political campaign."

67
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,080
But Gordon Sondland
disagreed saying:

68
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,820
"I believe you are incorrect
about President Trump's intentions...

69
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,020
No quid pro quo's... of any kind."

70
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,030
He suggested taking
the conversation offline.

71
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,940
He said: "I suggest we stop
the back and forth by text."

72
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,880
When you are that concerned

73
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,920
about not leaving a paper trail
in your conversation,

74
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,940
it's just inherently suspicious.

75
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,860
If you texted someone:

76
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,840
"Have you ever masturbated in the lawn
care aisle at Home Depot?"

77
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,980
and they responded with:

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,860
"I suggest we stop
the back and forth by text"

79
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,030
you pretty much
have your answer right there.

80
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,940
A lot of information is tumbling out
into the open thanks to this inquiry,

81
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,030
and none of it is good
for the White House.

82
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,830
It was just confirmed today
that a second whistleblower

83
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,860
with first-hand knowledge
of Trump's Ukraine dealings

84
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,850
spoke to the inspector general.

85
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,980
Other White House staffers
are now voicing broader concerns

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,840
about the president's
approach to diplomacy.

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,820
"The Washington Post"

88
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,860
chronicles President Trump's
conversations with other world leaders.

89
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,250
Often, they leave his aides
genuinely horrified.

90
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,200
Yeah, it's true.
According to the story,

91
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:20,180
Trump pestered Shinzo Abe to help
recommend him for a Nobel Prize,

92
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,240
was obsequious and fawning
to Vladimir Putin,

93
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,180
and in a call with Xi Jinping,

94
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,180
repeated numerous times how much
he liked a kind of chocolate cake.

95
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,200
While that last one sounds dumb,

96
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,160
at least "I like chocolate cake"
is a unifying message.

97
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:40,080
The president might be a racist foghorn
wrapped in old fried chicken skin,

98
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,260
but as far as chocolate cake
is concerned, he is us, and we is him.

99
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,060
Unless you don't like chocolate cake,

100
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,190
in which case feel free
to brick yourself up into a wall.

101
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,230
And look...
You fucking monsters!

102
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:58,150
While it should be clear
why Trump's Ukraine dealings are bad,

103
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,040
it is worth taking a second
to reflect just how bad.

104
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:07,110
Using your office to take down your
political rivals is what dictators do.

105
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,230
Trump asking China and Ukraine
to do that should really bother us.

106
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,000
The only question is,
will Republicans care?

107
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,820
And many seem to be trying very hard
to avoid commenting,

108
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,960
maybe because, when Marco Rubio
did comment, it didn't exactly go well.

109
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,960
Do you think it's okay
for President Trump to ask China

110
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,930
to launch an investigation
of Joe Biden and Hunter Biden?

111
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,940
I don't know if that's a real request
or him just needling the press,

112
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,950
knowing that you guys were
gonna get outraged by it.

113
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,900
I don't think it's a real request,
I think he did it to gig you guys.

114
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,850
He did it to provoke you to ask me
and others and get outraged by it.

115
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:45,910
Like I said, he plays it like a violin
and every-falls right into it.

116
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:51,020
"He plays the media like a violin"
only makes sense if he means:

117
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,820
"Trump plays the media
exactly like he plays the violin,

118
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,860
very loud, very badly, and sometimes
screaming at it for no reason."

119
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,800
But the clear subtext
of Rubio's argument there

120
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,990
is that Trump
is just trolling-he didn't mean it.

121
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,880
But I would not be sure
that that is true.

122
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,960
And even if it is, it doesn't matter.
People act on his jokes.

123
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,590
Russia took his "Help find Hillary's
emails" routine pretty seriously.

124
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,600
And shooting his mouth off
now is significantly worse,

125
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,560
because... you know,
he's the president.

126
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,550
Nixon famously justified his actions
during Watergate by saying:

127
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:32,500
"When the President does it,
that means that it is not illegal."

128
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,570
But Trump's case here
is actually the exact opposite of that.

129
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,660
Because if he was
just any old Fox News-addled idiot

130
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,560
ranting about how Biden should be
investigated, that would be one thing.

131
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,450
But he's not. He's the president,
he has real power,

132
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,580
and when he abuses it to keep himself
in power, that's a big problem.

133
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:55,620
It is a case where, when the president
does it, it has to be illegal.

134
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,440
And for good reason.
Because unfortunately,

135
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,500
not every foreign government will be as
brave and willing to stand up to Trump

136
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,470
as fucking Nickelback.

137
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,440
And now this!

138
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,440
British News Programs
Seem Unable To Book The Right Guest.

139
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,590
May I speak to Gareth Thomas,
the shadow minister for Civil Society.

140
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,040
He's in our central London studio.
Sir, good news, this?

141
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,120
I'm not Gareth Thomas, I'm Richard
Dodd from the British Retail Consortium.

142
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,120
We're joined now by Steven Joseph.

143
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,230
He's chief executive
of the Campaign for Better Transport.

144
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,260
- A very good morning to you.
- Unfortunately I'm Steve McKenzie.

145
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:38,070
- I'm the finance expert this morning.
- It's equally as good to have you on.

146
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,200
Joining us is Sara Adelbi,
a human rights barrister.

147
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,060
Hi, I'm Addi Kakabara,
from Amnesty International.

148
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,260
We have the wrong guest up.

149
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,080
Joining us from our New York studio
is Ben Walker

150
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,130
who's the baseball editor
for the Associated Press.

151
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,050
I know that you've been covering Roger
Clemens' career for the last 23 years.

152
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,050
Remind us how big a name he is
in the sport of baseball.

153
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,220
Ben, can you hear me in New York?
It's Francis in London.

154
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:09,170
It's even a worse situation than that.
Because I am not Ben Walker.

155
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,280
And I know nothing about baseball.

156
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,250
He's now attempting to scale
the world's highest mountain again.

157
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,060
He joins us now in the studio
ahead of his next mission.

158
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,230
- Good morning.
- I think you have the wrong guest.

159
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:32,340
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns China, the country that is,

160
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,350
not the thing you fill a cabinet with
when you've run out of human needs.

161
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,330
And I know there is a lot
going on with China right now,

162
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,330
from the ongoing pro-democracy
protests in Hong Kong to the trade war

163
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,230
that's been good and easy to win
for the last year and a half now.

164
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,310
But China took a moment
to celebrate the 70th anniversary

165
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:54,290
of the Communist Party coming to power
and they did it in some style.

166
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,360
Chinese President Xi Jinping
and other senior officials

167
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,260
watched a grand evening gala
Tuesday on Tiananmen Square.

168
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,360
A song called
"I Love You China" played.

169
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,230
And the number 70
was formed in the night sky.

170
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,300
They didn't just make a 70
out of fireworks,

171
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,240
people also made a 70
out of chickens and out of pandas.

172
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:22,160
That is a 7 made out of pandas,
with a zero made out of apples.

173
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,300
And if there aren't enough pandas
to make a whole 70 out of pandas,

174
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,340
maybe pandas don't deserve
to be made into a 70.

175
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,420
You might not like it when I imply
pandas are shitty and worthless,

176
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,290
but you know
who agrees with me on that?

177
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,350
Other pandas.
Pandas look at pandas and say:

178
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,380
"That thing sucks so much,
I would not fuck it

179
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,510
if the survival of my species depended
on it, which it absolutely does."

180
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,390
But look, that's not the point.

181
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:53,500
The point is, since China's government
is celebrating its last 70 years,

182
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,290
we thought we'd help
by highlighting

183
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,350
one the most massively consequential
policies they undertook in that time:

184
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,470
the one child-policy.

185
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,500
It began in 1980, and it was basically
exactly what it sounded like:

186
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,320
a policy from the government limiting
how many children families could have.

187
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,340
And I know
it might seem like old news,

188
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,320
but this policy actually ended
far more recently than you might think.

189
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,480
În China, the Communist Party

190
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:23,500
is ending the one child policy
as a method of population control.

191
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,370
That was 2015,

192
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,260
meaning China made the historic
decision to end its one child policy

193
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,230
the same year Pizza Rat
made the historic decision

194
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,320
to carry pizza down stairs
while being a rat.

195
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,230
Which one of those decisions
will prove to be more historic?

196
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,230
We won't know until future generations
are reading about both events

197
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:50,170
in the history textbook: "History Is
Memes: 435 Pages About Pizza Rat."

198
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,320
So, why talk about
something that's now over?

199
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,210
The history of the one child policy
reveals a lot

200
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:01,180
about how the Communist Party
has used and held on to its power.

201
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,390
And for another,
the effects of it are far from over.

202
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:09,360
The one child policy is behind a lot
of challenges facing China right now.

203
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,200
To take just one major example:
for reasons we'll discuss later,

204
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:20,190
there are currently around 34 million
more males than females in China.

205
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,350
That is a lot.

206
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,400
In some villages, the ratio of men
to women can be nearly two to one.

207
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,150
A situation that's made journalists
who've visited noticeably sad.

208
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,340
Welcome to the most miserable
place in China for lovers.

209
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,280
Here where single men sit around
all day, it seems, with nothing to do.

210
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,340
You come across them everywhere,
listless and hopeless.

211
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,190
That is so harsh!

212
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,170
"The most miserable place in China
for lovers."

213
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,350
I presume narrowly beating out
wherever they keep the pandas.

214
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,250
The one on the right
is clearly thinking:

215
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:00,350
"I am not doing it." And the one on
the left is completely fine with that.

216
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,220
So, tonight, let's talk
about China's one child policy:

217
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,300
why it happened, how it was carried out
and what the consequences have been.

218
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,330
And let's start with why it happened.

219
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:15,270
In the 60s and 70s, overpopulation
was a huge global concern,

220
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,240
with alarmists
making apocalyptic predictions.

221
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,280
Even Disney got in on it, producing
this video for the Population Council.

222
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:27,350
Suppose that in time,
more and more children are born.

223
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,190
The children will be sickly, unhappy,
with little hope for the future.

224
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,230
This picture can be true
for countless families

225
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,270
if the number of children
born is left to chance.

226
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,210
But fortunately,
this need not happen anymore.

227
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,090
Modern science has given us a key

228
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:49,060
that makes possible
a new kind of personal freedom:

229
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,230
family planning.

230
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,260
Family planning?
Never heard of it.

231
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,230
Okay, okay, so first:

232
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,060
I know that clip
seems a little racially problematic,

233
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,240
but let's remember Disney also made
"Song of the South",

234
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,180
so we're grading them
on a very steep curve here.

235
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,130
But secondly,
and I cannot stress this enough,

236
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:15,240
I don't care how useful the information
Donald has on family planning might be,

237
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,190
you never take advice
on having sex from a duck.

238
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:23,250
They have corkscrew-shaped penises
that they regrow every mating season.

239
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,040
Donald Duck
actually looks like this.

240
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,130
And I'm simply not taking
family planning lessons

241
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,590
from some corkscrew-dicked pervert.

242
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:40,500
In any case, curly-dick duck aside,
the overpopulation hysteria was global.

243
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,400
And China was no exception.

244
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,430
And the Communist Party also saw
controlling their population growth

245
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:49,530
as key to raising the China's economic
prospects and standard of living,

246
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,610
making it easier for them
to hold onto power.

247
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,550
So, who did they pick
to solve this issue?

248
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,550
Take a minute and think about
who would be the absolute worst choice

249
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,540
to craft a prescriptive
nationwide policy on reproduction

250
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,550
and, do keep in mind,
Jared Kushner is not Chinese.

251
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,620
I'll give you the answer,
it was actually the military.

252
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,620
The policy was crafted
by military scientists.

253
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,570
Which, as one expert will tell you,
was not ideal.

254
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,570
It was conceived by men.

255
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:20,590
So, and the, these men
were primarily missile scientists,

256
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,430
who envision women
as in some ways like machines.

257
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,590
What these men thought
were that, women's fertility,

258
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,480
you can push it up
or push it down like a switch.

259
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,770
They didn't understand
that that's not how things work.

260
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:37,960
She's absolutely right.
Family planning isn't rocket science.

261
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,810
That's exactly why rocket scientists
should not do it.

262
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,730
It's the same reason
we don't let OB-GYNs

263
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,720
launch babies into space
and land them on the moon.

264
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,880
Experts should stay in their lane.

265
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,950
This policy
was a nationwide directive,

266
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,900
in the form of an open letter
to members of the Communist Party,

267
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,880
but it was actually
implemented at the lower level,

268
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,820
meaning enforcement varied wildly
depending on where you lived.

269
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,910
There could be exceptions.

270
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:08,900
Many rural areas even allowed families
a second child if their first was a girl.

271
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,870
But, the general message
was to have just one child.

272
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,830
It was often expressed through
striking propaganda, like this!

273
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:22,960
If you have a second child,
you violate the law.

274
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,860
Then you'll be detained.

275
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,870
If you try to escape,
you will end up in jail.

276
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,800
Think twice about it.

277
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,110
Don't say I didn't warn you.

278
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:41,040
Holy fuck!
That is undeniably effective.

279
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,040
No better way to dissuade parents
from having more children

280
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,180
than by showing them
that particular child.

281
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,090
"Congratulations, Mrs. Jong, you've
given birth to a real aggro narc!"

282
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,210
There were also propaganda signs,
saying things like:

283
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,210
"Respond actively to the call that
each couple should have one child."

284
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,260
And "Have fewer children
but raise the quality."

285
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,250
Which is just
not how children work.

286
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,190
Children, and I say this
as a loving parent,

287
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,240
are not high-quality individuals.

288
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:16,240
Their artwork is derivative
and their stories, meandering.

289
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,140
No one who's ever been asked:
"Who's your ideal dinner guest"

290
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,060
has said, "Someone who insists
their food be dinosaur-shaped."

291
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:29,180
Broadly, the one child policy was also
enforced by an enormous bureaucracy.

292
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,110
At the national level, there were
half a million employees

293
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,400
in charge of administering it,
with many millions more

294
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,320
at the local level and their
scrutiny could be intense.

295
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:44,370
Workers must have their factory's
permission to get married.

296
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,390
Each team of 16 women,
has its birth planning worker.

297
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,550
She is constantly alert for
anyone who might be pregnant

298
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,560
or even thinking
of having a child.

299
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,460
We asked: "Doesn't the fact that
she's watching her workmates,"

300
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,370
"asking them
about their periods and so on,"

301
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,410
"doesn't that make
for resentment?"

302
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,450
No, the workers
are grateful for my concern.

303
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,540
Really?
Are you sure about that?

304
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,400
The workers are grateful
for your concern?

305
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:15,360
If there is anything I know about
women, and there definitely isn't,

306
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:19,380
it's that they love to be asked
about their periods at work.

307
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,360
Seriously. Just go up to a colleague
and say:

308
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,480
"How do you like
that DivaCup, girlfriend?"

309
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,460
"You wear it with a period
thong to prevent leakage?"

310
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,500
"How about that extra-absorbent
period toilet paper?"

311
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,450
My female writers told me that one
of those things I said isn't real,

312
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,850
but they refuse
to tell me which one.

313
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,020
If I'm honest, my money
is on "DivaCup"

314
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,060
'cause it sounds like what Mariah Carey
demands all her beverages come in.

315
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,910
I could be wrong, but obviously,
the enforcement went much further.

316
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,040
Local officials
would issue massive fines

317
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,980
for having more children
than you were allowed,

318
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,980
fines that routinely were multiple
times a household's annual income.

319
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,910
Many villages came to depend
upon those fines for revenue.

320
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,930
Even if parents could afford them,

321
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,080
some chose never to let
their kids ever forget it.

322
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,850
One child policy fines
are now so common

323
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,930
that they're being
incorporated into children's names.

324
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,890
Why did we name our child
"20000 Chen?"

325
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,980
That's how much we were fined
to have him, 20000 yuan.

326
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:25,900
Yeah. They named
their kid "20000 Chen"

327
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,040
so everyone would know what
they had to go through to have him.

328
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,890
It's the equivalent of

329
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:35,860
"Jason Last-Minute-Epidural-And-A-Lot
- Of-Shitting-On-The-Table Rabinowitz."

330
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,000
It's a lot
to make that kid carry around.

331
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:41,970
Massive fines were far
from the worst-case scenario,

332
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,930
particularly for girls.

333
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,060
In China, there's
a strong preference for boys,

334
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:51,130
which are seen as
an economic investment for old age,

335
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,060
as sons are expected
to support their parents.

336
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,090
Families would go to great lengths

337
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,060
to make sure that
their one child was a boy:

338
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,990
from abandoning girls,
to having sex-selective abortions,

339
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,080
to cases of female infanticide.

340
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,100
In some areas, the government's
methods of preventing more births,

341
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,130
regardless of gender,
were brutal.

342
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,110
Children could be taken
and sold to orphanages

343
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,130
and there were millions of forced
sterilizations and forced abortions.

344
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,150
This woman is still haunted
by the fact she was forced

345
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,980
to abort her child at nine months,

346
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,130
because her husband had a child
from a previous marriage.

347
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,130
It's like an arrow through my heart.
They made a mistake,

348
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,980
I should have had my baby,
they did not let me to keep my child.

349
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,140
The policy was
just so senseless.

350
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,980
That's obviously horrifying.
I know that there are some

351
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,050
who like to hold up China as a blanket
argument against abortion.

352
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:56,030
It is very easy to be both pro-choice
and anti-forced abortion,

353
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,100
in the same way you can be pro-drinking
fountain and anti-waterboarding.

354
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,110
The important thing is who's
in control of the fucking process.

355
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,980
As you have seen so far,
many heartbreaking decisions

356
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,080
were forced on Chinese families
by the one child policy.

357
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,140
You'll be relieved to hear

358
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,950
that we're gonna jump now
from the past to the present.

359
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,100
There are enormous ongoing
ramifications to China's policy

360
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,120
and much
like Donald Duck's penis,

361
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:28,080
there are a lot of twists and turns
and an important point at the end.

362
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,990
For a government that made it a point
to micromanage their citizens' lives,

363
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:37,150
China did little to prepare for
the long-term consequences.

364
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,910
And let's start
relatively small here.

365
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,920
The one child policy meant
that an entire generation

366
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,970
is filled with many only children.

367
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:49,840
Some theorize that means lots of kids
whose parents have overindulged them,

368
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:53,920
as a newscast explained in the '90s
in a not very tactful way.

369
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,880
A surprising by-product of China's
affluence is a young generation

370
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,940
with growing numbers
of fat children,

371
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,860
"little emperors" or "little meatballs"
as they're called in Chinese.

372
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:12,060
Calling that kid a little meatball
is both mean and adorable.

373
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,070
You shouldn't call a child a meatball
if he doesn't want to.

374
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,870
But on the other hand:
look at that little meatball!

375
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:25,040
Look at his little meatball hat. I want
to bite that little meatball's tummy.

376
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,920
I want to say "nom nom"

377
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,960
and throw him up
in the air and say:

378
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,980
"Who's a little meatball?
You are!"

379
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,970
That's the proper
reaction to that little meatball.

380
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:37,070
Hashtag #MeatballHero,
hashtag #ThatsASpicyMeatABall.

381
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,040
The policy didn't just produce
lots of scrumptious little meatballs.

382
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,900
Remember those fines
that resulted in 20000 Chen?

383
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,010
There were many parents who
did not have that kind of money.

384
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:53,970
But even if, for whatever reason,
they were able to keep their child,

385
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,850
there was a massive catch,
as this woman,

386
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,030
born 26 years ago as a second
child, can attest.

387
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:04,010
Officials told her parents
they would have to pay a fine,

388
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,030
the equivalent to about
four years of their salaries.

389
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,000
They could never afford it,

390
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:12,050
so she was never registered
as a Chinese citizen.

391
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,070
Her birth certificate
has a blank instead of her name.

392
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,000
Without an ID card,
I can't have a normal life.

393
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,970
I could never go to school,
never see a doctor.

394
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:29,860
I can't work and I can't get married.
It makes me very sad.

395
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:33,930
Exactly. She can't go to the doctor,
find a job, or get married.

396
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,890
She's a ghost without all the fun
parts of being a ghost,

397
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,260
like rattling chains,
or summoning cold winds,

398
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,140
or making terrible ceramics
while having sex with Demi Moore.

399
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,190
That woman is far from alone.

400
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:53,210
At least six and a half million Chinese
have no official status

401
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,050
because they were born
outside the family planning rules.

402
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,060
But one of the largest and perhaps
most far reaching effects of a policy

403
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,090
that resulted in the elimination
of millions of girls,

404
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,110
is that a couple of decades later
you have a generation

405
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,200
with a massive gender disparity
and far more men than women,

406
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,130
34 million more,
you may remember.

407
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:18,110
Millions of Chinese men will end up
without female mates.

408
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:21,170
Which has created a number
of odd business opportunities

409
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,240
to give men an edge
in attracting women.

410
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:28,150
This is an agency catering for
China's growing population of singles.

411
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,220
Choosing the right clothes,
the right chat lines on the first date

412
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,110
are all part of the plan.

413
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,250
For singles like Lo Gu Zhang,

414
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,180
newfound magic skills
may do the trick.

415
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,770
"You can really impress a girl,"
he says,

416
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:45,600
"and they'll become
attracted without even knowing it."

417
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,840
I know this might seem
hard to believe,

418
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,660
but that's actually a pretty
amazing magic trick there.

419
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:56,690
At the beginning, the hoop
and the chain are separate.

420
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,600
By the end, any woman he's talking
to has disappeared.

421
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:07,670
No matter how many cool tricks
they learn,

422
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:11,680
millions of men who want
a wife will never have one.

423
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,670
Which has led to a bunch
of unintended consequences,

424
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,770
including the success
of this company.

425
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,650
There are far too many men in China
compared to the number of women.

426
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,670
It's a great business opportunity.

427
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,840
There are more single men who cannot
find a wife and are desperate.

428
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,620
We've decided to make
life-sized dolls for them.

429
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,790
These men are happy to pay the price,
because the alternative

430
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,700
is to be alone
for the rest of their lives.

431
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,200
Buying a life-sized sex doll does not
stop you from being alone.

432
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,220
It makes you somehow more alone

433
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,080
than you were
when you were totally alone.

434
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,090
If one is the loneliest number,

435
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:58,030
one and a sex doll is the even
loneliester number.

436
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:02,110
While buying a sex doll
to replace the wife you'll never have

437
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:07,030
may seem like rock-bottom,
it's somewhere around rock-middle.

438
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:10,210
The gender imbalance created
by the one child policy

439
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,180
has created
a huge market for human trafficking,

440
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,240
with women and girls trafficked from
within China or surrounding countries

441
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,010
to be sold as wives
for Chinese men.

442
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,210
One study estimated that,
in just a four-year period,

443
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,110
21000 women and girls,
just from northern Myanmar,

444
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,240
were forced into marriage
in one Chinese province alone.

445
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:36,160
It isn't fair to expect the rocket
scientists who designed this policy

446
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:41,050
to anticipate the boom times it would
create for sex dolls and trafficking.

447
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:45,230
The irony is that one of the key
justifications for the policy

448
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,320
was that it would boost
China's future economic prospects.

449
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,250
Those prospects are under threat,
thanks to that very policy.

450
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,410
China's population is rapidly aging

451
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,410
and the youngest generation
is facing crushing responsibilities.

452
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:04,410
Researchers estimate that by 2025,
one in five Chinese in urban areas

453
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:08,320
will be over 60
and that by 2050,

454
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:12,260
that age group will increase
to 30 percent of the population.

455
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,290
The policy has led to what
is called the 4-2-1 problem,

456
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:22,290
where one child will be responsible
for two parents and four grandparents.

457
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,430
Right, that's a lot
for someone to take on.

458
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:29,200
If you've seen "Willy Wonka
&amp; The Chocolate Factory",

459
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,440
you know the pressure
of having four grandparents,

460
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,270
all relying on you.

461
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:37,240
Best-case scenario, you win a
chocolate contest and you end up

462
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,430
impressing a slave-owner by surviving
his child murder factory.

463
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,290
But that's only gonna happen
to what? 12-14 of them, tops.

464
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,380
The rest are facing
a big challenge here.

465
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:51,270
There are worrying signs for China.
From 2012 to 2017,

466
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:56,260
the country's working-age population
decreased by 25 million people,

467
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,340
the equivalent
of the entire population of Australia

468
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,360
disappearing from the workforce.

469
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,290
And not for the reasons Australians
usually leave the workforce,

470
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,350
like being carried off
by a giant snake.

471
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:10,370
Australia is a terrible island
full of monsters.

472
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:14,290
Those aren't even stars on their
flag. They're spiders.

473
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,230
Get out of here!
You're disgusting.

474
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:22,330
And the troubling economic forecast
is a big reason why China's government

475
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,380
decided to end
their one child policy.

476
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,420
If you think:
"Great, happy ending."

477
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,260
"The government learned its lesson
and stopped meddling with family size",

478
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,320
not exactly.

479
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,240
Remember that clip earlier announcing
that the policy was over?

480
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,280
Let me play it out just a little bit.

481
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,380
The Communist Party is ending
that country's one child policy

482
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,950
as a method of population control.

483
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,920
All couples will now be allowed
to have two children.

484
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:54,120
Exactly! The one child policy is over,
but a two child policy has begun.

485
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,010
Chinese couples
can do whatever they want,

486
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,920
as long as what they want
is having two children

487
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,010
like the government
wants them to want.

488
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:06,980
Many couples don't want that. China's
birth rate has fallen to its lowest,

489
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:10,990
despite the policy shift, due in part
to rising living standards

490
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,970
and the cost of having children.

491
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:17,140
The Chinese government is pushing
the appeal of two children hard,

492
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,010
in ways that may, by now,
seem a little familiar to you.

493
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:24,150
There's propaganda, once again,
they've released stamps

494
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,010
showing a happy
monkey with two babies,

495
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,090
there are signs that say things like:
"One is too few, two is just right;"

496
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,150
"The young will have siblings,
the old will be cared for."

497
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,000
There are
government-produced PSA's...

498
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,080
To all our friends of childbearing age,
are you aware that the two child policy

499
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:45,140
went into effect
on January 1st, 2016?

500
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,940
The reform
of family planning services

501
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,920
will be a great thing
for not only each family,

502
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,820
but also the great family
that makes up China.

503
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,890
Look, I'll grant that that was a very
compelling argument

504
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,910
made by a very sexy cartoon.

505
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,920
We all agree on that, right?
That's a hot 'toon right there.

506
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,950
When you consider...
Now you get it, now you see it.

507
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:12,980
We've got the same tie on.
That's a copyright infringement.

508
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:18,890
When you consider all the one
child propaganda before that,

509
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,880
that's pretty jarring to watch.

510
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,940
I haven't seen a turnaround
that abrupt

511
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,910
since Subway changed their slogan
from "eat fresh"

512
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,840
to "forget that pedophile".

513
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,860
It was direct.
You have to give that to them.

514
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,820
Enforcement of the two child policy
is being left to local officials,

515
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,990
so methods for carrying it out
can still vary.

516
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,930
There are concerns
that the low birthrate

517
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:46,940
is behind a push in some provinces
to tighten access to abortion

518
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,480
and make it more difficult
to get divorced.

519
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,600
And in other areas, where two
is being treated as a hard limit,

520
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:57,580
people exceeding those limits are
frightened of the worst consequences.

521
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:01,530
Listen to this man, whose wife
got pregnant with their third child.

522
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:05,440
He was so terrified, he'd only
talk with his identity disguised.

523
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,510
A third baby is not allowed,
so we went into hiding.

524
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,580
Family planning officers conduct
pregnancy tests every three months.

525
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,480
They would have done
a forced abortion.

526
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,590
And that right there does suggest
the Chinese government

527
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,570
still hasn't learned
the fundamental lesson here:

528
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,500
people are not machines,

529
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:30,470
whose reproductive systems
can be turned on or off at will.

530
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,410
Pretending otherwise leads
to all the consequences you've seen,

531
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,520
from the entirely foreseeable,
like trauma and heartbreak,

532
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:41,430
to the less anticipated ones
like delicious little meatballs,

533
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,430
desperate magic tricks

534
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,490
and a factory that can't pump
out sex dolls fast enough.

535
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,450
That image is pretty on-the-nose:

536
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:53,750
a factory churning out
headless silicone women,

537
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:57,750
because rocket scientists nearly
40 years ago didn't care enough

538
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,940
about what their policies
might do to real ones.

539
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,730
As China's Communist Party
celebrates its 70 years in power,

540
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,930
it seems worth remembering a massive
way that they used that power.

541
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:12,780
And if they are running low
on pandas, which they clearly are,

542
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:16,820
I'd argue that sex dolls might be
a more appropriate tribute.

543
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,870
They've certainly got enough
of them.

544
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,920
So, happy 70th
to the Chinese government.

545
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,870
And now, this.

546
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:31,960
More Local News Beat Poetry
From NBC4 Washington's Pat Collins.

547
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:38,840
Two scammers got a shopper inside
Whole Foods talking about rice.

548
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,900
Soon, they disappeared.
And so did her wallet.

549
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:50,960
See this display case here?
It used to be way over there.

550
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,900
Now, it's back here in what's left
of the break room.

551
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:00,740
A video chat. She takes off
her clothes,

552
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,810
he takes off his clothes.

553
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:08,730
And then, sextortion!

554
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,780
The sign over here says "open",

555
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:17,860
but this morning it was far more
open than they ever intended it to be.

556
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,860
Two days later, same kind
of pick up truck, same M.O.!

557
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:28,750
In goes the truck!
Down goes the ATM.

558
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:33,680
ATM here.
Not anymore.

559
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:39,830
Police say they also seized a car.
A car with flashing lights.

560
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,880
A car with a siren.

561
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:46,700
A car with police equipment.

562
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:49,850
It was a Honda.

563
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:58,710
That's our show, thanks for watching.
See you next week. Goodnight!

564
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,780
