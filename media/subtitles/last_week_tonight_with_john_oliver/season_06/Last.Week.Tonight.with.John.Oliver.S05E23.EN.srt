LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,840
SEASON VI
EPISODE 23

3
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,440
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,800
Thank you so much for joining us.
A quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,560
A busy one: John Bolton being fired
as national security adviser,

6
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,160
Mike Pence telling people

7
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,920
he was bitten so hard
by the horse American Pharaoh

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,120
that he nearly collapsed,
to which I say, good horse...

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,120
To the latest Democratic
candidate debate, where Joe Biden,

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,360
in responding to a question about the
legacy of American slavery, said this.

11
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,560
We bring social workers
into homes with parents

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,400
to help them deal
with how to raise their children.

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,320
It's not that they don't want to help.
They don't know quite what to do.

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,480
Play the radio.
Make sure the television, excuse me,

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,160
make sure you have
the record player on at night.

16
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,720
The phone...
make sure the kids hear words.

17
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,600
Shit !
That is Joe Biden saying "television",

18
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,920
then replacing it
with "record player",

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,480
and then, barely stopping himself
from saying "phonograph."

20
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,280
Let's all remember
that very funny moment

21
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,920
when Biden sends a concession
telegram to Trump next November.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,960
But instead of focusing on that,
let's instead move on to Russia,

23
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,520
voted home
of the world's sexiest president

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,960
by "Please, I Have A Family,
Do Whatever He Says ! Magazine".

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,520
There were city council elections,
and the run-up to them had been tense

26
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,200
because Putin's United Russia Party
has been declining in popularity,

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,280
and, and by sheer coincidence,
the Central Election Commission there

28
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,640
decided to ban many
opposition candidates from running,

29
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,840
setting off a summer
of protests in Moscow

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,480
with thousands of attendees
and mass arrests.

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,560
Putin tried to dispel concerns
over the suspicious lack of candidates,

32
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,680
arguing it was actually a good thing.

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,240
In some countries there are 30, 50,
even 100 candidates.

34
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,040
It doesn't mean they do better work.
It's quality not quantity that counts.

35
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,400
"I mean, look at Netflix."

36
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,680
"You have choices,
but where is quality control ?"

37
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,240
"What is 'Frontier' ?
What is 'The Order' ?"

38
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,080
"What is 'Malibu Rescue' ?
What is 'Workin' Moms' ?"

39
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,120
"What is 'Back with Ex' ?"

40
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,840
"How does this business model work ?
Somebody explain it to me."

41
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,040
To combat Putin's thumb
on the scale,

42
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,040
opposition leaders like Alexei Navalny,
encouraged supporters to vote tactically,

43
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,520
supporting any candidate
that could beat a pro-Kremlin one.

44
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,800
It seems to have worked,

45
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,400
with the ruling party losing a third
of its seats in Moscow's city council.

46
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,600
Navalny and his associates have since
been the target of government raids

47
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,440
and he has some really good ideas
as to why that might've happened.

48
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,600
Putin got really upset
because of the tactical vote

49
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,480
and that his sweet child,
the United Russia Party,

50
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,000
has been busted in Moscow
and seriously beaten in the regions.

51
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,800
Yes, he is upset
and he is stomping his little feet.

52
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,160
"Stomping his little feet."

53
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,120
Not only is that comment very brave,
it also made me genuinely curious:

54
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,880
does Putin have little feet ?

55
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,400
I did what any normal,
reasonable person would do

56
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,400
and I looked up Putin
on wikiFeet.

57
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,680
The results are in and look
at this guy's tiny little feet !

58
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,360
You just wanna gooch 'em !
You wanna gooch those little piggies !

59
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,720
This little piggy went to market,
this little piggy stayed at home.

60
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,960
This little piggy had borscht,
this little piggy had none.

61
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,160
And this little piggy
went "wee wee wee"

62
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,560
all the way to a prison camp
in Siberia.

63
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,720
What did that little piggy do ?
We'll never know.

64
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,480
Shut up about the little piggy.

65
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,760
With elections rigged
and dissent suppressed,

66
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,480
some Russians came up with creative
ways to express their frustration.

67
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,520
Perhaps the most entertaining one
concerned a rapper named Timati.

68
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,840
On the off chance that you are not one
of his 14 million Instagram followers,

69
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,120
let me give you
a taste of what he's like.

70
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,160
He seems
sort of fun and harmless,

71
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,920
dressing like a ski patrolman
whose first aid kit is full of Rohypnol,

72
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,720
and posting videos like this.

73
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,920
That's fine, but, but honestly, I'm not
sure everybody wants to be like you.

74
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,600
Because if they're at all like me,
everybody would like a lot more

75
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,120
than zero layers of protection between
their genitals and high-speed water.

76
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,840
Timati also really likes
these collectible bears. Seriously.

77
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:57,000
He really, really, really, really,
really likes these collectible bears.

78
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,840
He loves them. This is his home. Those
bears watch him sleep. And he, them.

79
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,400
This seems like a harmless obsession
for a young boy of 12-going-on-36

80
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,880
until you realize that some of them,
like this Coco Chanel bear,

81
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,760
apparently can run
upwards of $28,000 at auction.

82
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,120
Which is ridiculous. It seems
like Timati has every bear ever made.

83
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,640
Except, I actually know for a fact
that he doesn't, because, behold:

84
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,320
the rarest bear of all.

85
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,200
What do you think, Timati ?

86
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,600
Everybody wanna be like me.
Everybody wanna be like me.

87
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,960
But look, before you find yourself
becoming a fan of Timati,

88
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,720
you should know,
he hangs out with friends

89
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,920
like Chechen dictator-slash-failed
cat owner Ramzan Kadyrov,

90
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,760
and his best friend is President Putin,

91
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,920
as you can tell from one of his songs:
"My Best Friend is President Putin."

92
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,600
My best friend is President Putin.

93
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,720
My best friend is President Putin.

94
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,760
We get it.
I gotta say though,

95
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,080
it is genuinely jarring to hear
a rap song that is so pro-authority.

96
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,520
It's like if N.W.A.'s biggest hit song

97
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,240
had been called:
"Hip Hip Hooray for the Police."

98
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,880
So, you might justifiably ask
at this point,

99
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,080
"What the fuck has Timati got to do
with Moscow's local elections ?"

100
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,840
Just before they took place,

101
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,920
he and fellow rapper Guf, real name,
put out a video called "Moscow".

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,120
It was a classic Timati-Guf collab,
if I ever heard one, and I haven't.

103
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,400
The song featured lyrics like:

104
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,000
Moscow is "the city
that doesn't hold gay parades"

105
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,840
and "I don't go to protests
and talk bullshit."

106
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,280
In the midst of a fraught election,
people did not react well to that.

107
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,160
"Moscow" became the most
down-voted video on Russian YouTube.

108
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,440
The backlash got so bad,
Timati posted,

109
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,280
"I am deleting this video
to stop this wave of negativity,"

110
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,520
which, if we've learned anything
from the internet, always works.

111
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,760
Guf claimed he'd been tricked
into participating in a political video,

112
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,640
putting out this Instagram statement.

113
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,960
I had no idea that we had mayoral
elections the day before yesterday.

114
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,240
I was told that we need
to wish the city a happy birthday

115
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,680
because we are Muscovites,
and it would be nice.

116
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,440
I fell for that bullshit.

117
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah, sorry, Guf,
but you done goofed on this one.

118
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,920
Although it was Moscow's
872nd birthday, which is traditionally

119
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,320
the "make a homophobic jock jam
for the government anniversary".

120
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,640
Many Russians are understandably
frustrated with their government,

121
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,200
and they're taking that frustration
out wherever they can

122
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,440
even on a medicalgrade fuckboy

123
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,600
with a sadly incomplete
toy-bear collection.

124
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,080
While I doubt the opposition
is gonna topple Putin anytime soon,

125
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,520
it is encouraging to see them able
to keep him on his tiny little toes.

126
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,920
And now... this !

127
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,040
And Now Maria Bartiromo's Guests

128
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,400
Will Never Let Her Forget
What September 11th Really Means.

129
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,240
It helps to remember where we were,
what we felt,

130
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,800
who we talked
to on September 11th of 2001

131
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,600
and also how we felt on
September 12th of 2001, 17 years later.

132
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,160
You're sure right. Mitch ?

133
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,120
- Three words: happy birthday, Maria.
- Mitch. Thank you for that.

134
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,480
Yes, happy birthday.

135
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,680
I would be remiss if today I did not
remember the fallen heroes on 9/11

136
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,480
and together with all of the massive
legion of fans across this country,

137
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,480
if we did not wish Maria Bartiromo
a happy birthday.

138
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,120
Say a prayer for all who are lost,
thank a cop and a fireman,

139
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,120
and to you, Maria,
happy birthday.

140
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,960
No. I don't, yeah, no.
Let's not do that.

141
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,000
Now, I can't believe you.
Thank you !

142
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,320
You brought this cake ?
Thank you, Dick !

143
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,240
I have the worst birthday ever.

144
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,080
My husband calls it "The International
Day of Sadness" all the time.

145
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,280
But I appreciate you thinking of me
on this... It was my birthday first.

146
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,600
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns: immigration.

147
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,480
It's the system that brought you
Albert Einstein, Yo-Yo Ma, and me.

148
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,280
And yes, obviously:
fuck, marry, kill, respectively.

149
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,160
Immigration is the subject that Trump
campaigned on the hardest

150
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,880
and as president,
his tone hasn't exactly softened.

151
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,240
I told my people yesterday,
our country's full.

152
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,160
We're full, our system's full,
our country's full.

153
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,120
Can't come in. Our country is full.
What can you do ?

154
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,720
We can't handle anymore.
Our country is full.

155
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,280
Can't come in. I'm sorry.

156
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,800
He's right. Our country is full.
I mean just take a look at it.

157
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,920
The thing is absolutely packed.

158
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
There is simply no room, here.
Maybe if one of these guys dies,

159
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,720
but until then,
there's just nothing we can do.

160
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,320
But look,
it is obviously not that simple.

161
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,080
And in Trump's more
reflective moments, seen here,

162
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,080
he claims that there is one kind
of immigration that he wants:

163
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,480
legal immigration.

164
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,560
The thing that he and his political
allies will tell you they love.

165
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,800
I want legal immigration.
I want great people to come in.

166
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,440
I want legal immigration.

167
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,000
I believe legal immigration
is good for our country.

168
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,680
I believe illegal immigration isn't.

169
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,680
My views on immigration are simple

170
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,360
and I've summed them up
many times in just four words:

171
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,040
legal good, illegal bad.

172
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,320
I do not like that man Ted Cruz.
I do not like him in the news.

173
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,160
I do I not like what he just said,
I do not like his boxy head.

174
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,360
I do not like him wearing glasses,
I do not like him kissing asses.

175
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,800
I wish he'd never get one vote.
That man Ted Cruz can lick my scrote.

176
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,920
But look, here's the thing,
if we take all of them at their word,

177
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,680
we actually agree on this:
legal immigration is good.

178
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,640
That is a popular opinion,

179
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,760
both among those who see immigration
as foundational to America,

180
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,400
and among economists who largely
agree that it increases economic growth.

181
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,000
About 13% of the people
in this country are immigrants,

182
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,720
three-quarters of whom
are here legally.

183
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,920
So this system affects a lot of people.

184
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,160
With the talk about illegal immigration
the flaws in the legal pathway,

185
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,200
which arguably help fuel illegal
immigration-often get ignored.

186
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,800
So tonight, let's talk about
our legal immigration system.

187
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,600
There are a lot of misconceptions
about a process

188
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,440
that most Americans
have never experienced.

189
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,960
A key misconception is captured
in a phrase that you hear all the time,

190
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,840
both from politicians
and from ordinary voters.

191
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,600
We want to let people in legally.

192
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,200
Get in line and we want
to let people in legally.

193
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,560
They have to do it the right way.
They have to get in line.

194
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,120
Come legally
and wait in line like all of them.

195
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,640
There are a lot of people from
all around the world that are in line

196
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,440
and waiting to come in here,

197
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,840
and I don't think that they
should be able to come in

198
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,080
ahead of all these people that have
been really struggling to get here.

199
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,880
Right. "Get in line."
I know that is an appealing phrase,

200
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,960
but it's significantly
more complicated than that,

201
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,640
as you could probably tell
from that woman's reaction.

202
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,160
I'm guessing the closed captioning
for which is probably, "The fuck... ?"

203
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,120
Because the truth is,
for those who want to come here,

204
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,600
there is no one line to get in,
the lines that do exist

205
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,480
can be prohibitively long
or have sudden dead ends,

206
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,960
and for many people
there simply isn't a line at all.

207
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,520
If you're thinking: "My ancestors
waited on line" not necessarily.

208
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,120
For America's first hundred years,
there were no federal immigration laws,

209
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,120
so coming here "the right way"

210
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,920
basically just meant not slipping
as you walked down the gangway.

211
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,520
Now, since then,
our immigration system has evolved

212
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,480
into one with complicated
and convoluted restrictions.

213
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,920
Take country caps. When it comes
to most types of green card

214
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,760
which allow you to be a lawful,
permanent resident

215
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,000
no more than 7% of immigrants
accepted each year

216
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,920
can come from any one country.

217
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,520
What that means
is practice is that big countries,

218
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,360
with a lot of would be immigrants,
like China, India, and Mexico,

219
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,160
are subject to the same numerical caps
as tiny ones like Malta,

220
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,920
which is so tiny,
that's actual size.

221
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,040
In fact, that's actually Malta.

222
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,760
We borrowed it and put it in this box
to show you how small Malta is.

223
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,120
And it's not just numerical caps.

224
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,320
The system has a lot of restrictions
on who, exactly, can come here.

225
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,040
The best way to understand it

226
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,280
is that there are just four paths
to permanent residency or citizenship:

227
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,320
family - you're related
to someone who's already here,

228
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,560
employment
- you were offered a job here,

229
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,040
good luck - you won the visa lottery,
which I'll explain later,

230
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,240
or bad luck - you're a refugee
or seeking asylum.

231
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,760
And the number of people going through
each path is by no means equal.

232
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,640
Proportionally, they should probably
look a lot more like this.

233
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,800
Let's start with the way
that most immigrants come here:

234
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,080
family sponsorship.

235
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,280
About 2/3 of green card holders
come through the family based system.

236
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,400
Which makes sense.

237
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,000
Families provide support,
and some, I'm told, like each other.

238
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,440
But to Donald Trump,
family-based migration is a scourge,

239
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,640
as you can tell
from how he refers to it.

240
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,880
Chain migration is not a good thing.
Chain migration is bad.

241
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,600
We have to end chain migration.

242
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,040
Then you have chain migration.
Chain migration.

243
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,640
A guy comes in,
stone-cold killer, in many cases

244
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,600
a guy comes in, and then you
have to bring his aunt,

245
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,440
his uncle, his father,
his grandfather, his grandparents,

246
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,800
his third niece
by a different marriage.

247
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,760
That is so wrong
in so many ways,

248
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,280
it would be hard
for a fact-checker to assess it.

249
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,920
Couldn't even be described

250
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,040
by The Washington Post's
"Bottomless Pinocchio",

251
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,880
which sounds like an all-nude
strip club for wooden puppets.

252
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:07,480
Bringing family members over
is not as easy as Trump makes it sound.

253
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,920
You can only sponsor close relatives,
a spouse, child, sibling or parent.

254
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,960
No aunt, no uncle, no grandparents,
no third niece by a different marriage.

255
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,480
Anyone who comes in has to pass
rigorous background checks,

256
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,320
which tends to weed out
any "stone-cold killers".

257
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,600
And that "chain", as you should
not put it, can move very slowly.

258
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,120
Those country caps apply to many
categories of family-based immigration.

259
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,280
If you're trying to bring
your sibling over from China,

260
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,080
the government is processing
applications from 2006.

261
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:49,360
If they're in India, 2004.
From Mexico, January of 1997.

262
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,800
That's 22 years ago !

263
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,960
And who knows what they'll be
doing 22 years in advance ?

264
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:01,680
Aside, of course, from Pat Sajak.
He'll still be standing by a wheel,

265
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,280
selling vowels he doesn't own,
until the fucking sun dies.

266
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:13,160
The family-sponsorship system
is still too permissive for Trump,

267
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,120
who wants to limit it
to just spouses and children.

268
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,680
Meaning, you could no longer sponsor
your parents to immigrate here.

269
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,240
Although, he seemed fine
with one high-profile exception.

270
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,680
President Trump's in-laws slipping
in and out of a federal building

271
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,400
where they took the oath
of U.S. citizenship.

272
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,600
Sources tell ABC News that
First Lady Melania Trump

273
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,760
sponsored her Slovenian-born parents,
Viktor and Amalija Knavs.

274
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,560
Chain migration !

275
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,840
That is obviously hypocritical,
I know it's not the important here,

276
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,600
but Melania's mom is 74,

277
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,280
making Trump exactly one year younger
than his mother-in-law.

278
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,760
While there are plenty of spouses
who probably should be

279
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,080
closer to their in-laws,
that is simply not the way to do it.

280
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,240
So that is the family-based path,

281
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,560
which only works if you have
a close relative in America,

282
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,600
and it doesn't hurt if she's in
a loveless marriage with the president.

283
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,560
If that is not an option for you,
you try the employment-based path.

284
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,840
The way that pathway
usually begins is,

285
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,040
an employer in America sponsors you,
you come on a temporary work visa.

286
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,400
But it is temporary.
You might be able to renew it,

287
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,920
but there can be limits on how
many times you can do that.

288
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,920
Even getting a work visa
in the first place can be difficult.

289
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,400
You have to fit
within narrow categories.

290
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,680
There is R-1,
for religious workers.

291
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,600
P-1A, that's for athletes.
H-2A, that's for farm workers.

292
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,960
C-3PO for effete British robots.

293
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,760
And R2-D2 for their
common law husbands.

294
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,680
It's a complex system !
I came over on an O-1 visa,

295
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,520
which is for persons with extraordinary
ability in the arts

296
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,480
and I know what you're thinking...

297
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,400
I know what you're really
thinking deep down and fuck you !

298
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,920
Certain work visas are so hard to get,
highly skilled people get turned away.

299
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,120
Take Kunal Bahl,

300
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,680
the founder of a successful Indian
company called "SnapDeal".

301
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,000
He went to college in the U.S.,
and watch as he's interviewed

302
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,960
at a conference in India, about why
he ended up creating a company there,

303
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,640
rather than staying here.

304
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,200
I got a job at Microsoft
and I was quite happy,

305
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,560
the Indian tech guy
wanting to work in Microsoft

306
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,000
and they applied for my visa,
which got rejected.

307
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,240
Now you're stuck and
getting deported to your country !

308
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,880
You decided to start a company here.
Thank god.

309
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,080
I'm glad that that story
worked out well for India.

310
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,240
But it's frankly not a great
result for America, is it ?

311
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,920
Who educated him, and then forced him
to go innovate somewhere else.

312
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,280
I respect Kunal Bahl for not going

313
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,240
full "Pretty Woman" on a U.S.
immigration office.

314
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,680
"Big mistake. Huge."

315
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,360
It is worth noting: just getting
a work visa does not mean

316
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,440
you're going
to end up staying here.

317
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,680
Converting it into a green card
can be difficult to impossible

318
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,800
depending on your skill level
and where you're from.

319
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,800
You need your employer to choose
to sponsor you again

320
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,480
and there aren't many
green cards to go around.

321
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,280
Around 140 000 of them
are granted every year.

322
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,000
Think of getting a work visa as getting
a back stage pass to see BTS.

323
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,440
It'll allow ya to hang around,

324
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,000
but you're probably not gonna end up
becoming part of the band.

325
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,440
I can tell you from experience:
living on a visa can be stressful

326
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,760
and involves having to jump
through endless, costly hoops.

327
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,080
I used to have to file for extensions
to my visa every year,

328
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,960
hoping they'd be granted and had
to leave the country every 11 months

329
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,600
to go to the American embassy
in London to get a physical stamp

330
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,080
allowing me to travel.

331
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,040
I was constantly worried that
I would not be allowed to come back.

332
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,640
Even when you are approved
for a green card,

333
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,680
there might not be one available
for you because those country caps

334
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,360
also apply to employment-based
immigration.

335
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,440
So, if you come in from, say, India,

336
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,680
your estimated wait time
can be ridiculously high.

337
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
A boy living in America finds out
how long his dad might have to wait.

338
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,920
So, your dad has applied for a green
card for himself and your family

339
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,800
and the U.S. government looked
at his application and approved it.

340
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,760
There's a waiting line for green card
and that line is really long for India.

341
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,960
Very well it'd be about 60 years
by the time your dad gets a green card.

342
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,040
If I'm doing my math right...

343
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,280
Dad will be over 100
and I'll be 71 ?

344
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:54,040
Well, nearly. Your dad'll be dead.
But yeah, you will be 71.

345
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,000
Or dead. You could be
as dead as your very dead dad.

346
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,800
But overall,
your point is a good one there, kid.

347
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,280
The family and employment paths

348
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,440
make up 80 percent
of legal immigration.

349
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,240
What about if you are not related
to somebody here

350
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,440
and you aren't highly skilled ?

351
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,600
That brings us to the luck categories.
If you are lucky,

352
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,280
you could come to America through
the "diversity visa lottery",

353
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,840
which I'll let the president explain
what it isn't.

354
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,800
They call it "visa lottery".
I just call it "lottery",

355
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,040
where countries come in and
they put names in a hopper.

356
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,720
Common sense means they're
not giving you their best names.

357
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,200
They're giving you people
they don't want

358
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,800
and then we take 'em out
and where they do it by hand,

359
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,440
probably what's in their hand
are the worst of the worst.

360
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,240
No time to break down how wrong
everything he just said was,

361
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,480
but suffice to say: Trump can expect
a visit from Bottomless Pinocchio.

362
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,920
Everything about what
he just said is wrong.

363
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,800
The country the person comes from
is not involved,

364
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,560
they don't give us anyone,
the people who win are vetted,

365
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,080
and it's not done by hand.

366
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,680
22 million people applied in 2017.
Does he honestly think we made

367
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,200
one of those spinning bingo hoppers
for 22 million Ping-Pong balls ?

368
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:25,120
Anybody who lives in a country with
low immigration rates to the US

369
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,560
can enter themselves into
a computer-run, non-bowl-based lottery

370
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,160
for the chance to win
a "diversity visa".

371
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,360
Out of the millions of people
who enter, only 50 000 win.

372
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,840
Your odds of winning that lottery
to come into the country

373
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,520
are about the same as your odds
of getting shot once you get here.

374
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,080
Basically, if you win:
congratulations ! For now.

375
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,040
The visa lottery is the longest
of long shots.

376
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:59,080
Which brings us to our final
category here: bad luck.

377
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,520
Refugees and asylum seekers
fleeing terrible situations.

378
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,400
America has long prided itself,
with some reason,

379
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,320
on the fact that it's led the world
in terms of refugee resettlement,

380
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,680
accepting more refugees annually
than any other country.

381
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,880
But Trump does not care for that.
He has attacked the asylum system,

382
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,880
and while Obama set the annual cap
on refugees at 110 000

383
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,040
in his last year in office,

384
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,160
Trump slashed it
to 45 000 the next year

385
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,720
and 30 000 the year after that.

386
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,600
At this rate, next year's cap
will be reduced to just Zaid.

387
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,040
Trump will probably make his
campaign slogan: "Get Rid of Zaid."

388
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,960
If you're thinking Trump might have
a change of heart

389
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,760
if he just heard what some of these
refugees are fleeing, you're wrong.

390
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,920
Take Nadia Murad, a Yazidi woman
who was abducted by ISIS in Iraq.

391
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,720
She fled to Germany
after they killed her family,

392
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,200
won a Nobel Prize for her advocacy
and got to tell her story

393
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,920
to Trump's face in the Oval Office.

394
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You're about to see the second time
she's specifically mentioned to him

395
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,960
that her family was killed and watch
how little he has been listening.

396
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,280
All this happened to me, they killed
my mom, my six brothers...

397
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,560
- Where are they now ?
- They killed them.

398
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,600
What are you doing ?
"Where are they now ?"

399
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,600
She just told you three
fucking words ago.

400
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,360
That is the U.S. president displaying
indifference to human suffering

401
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,880
rivaled only by robots
and house cats.

402
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,000
And they really don't give a shit.
Things could get even worse.

403
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,320
Trump's White House is weighing

404
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,600
whether to cut the number of refugees
we admit to zero next year.

405
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,320
And if they do that, tell me:

406
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,760
what is the right way
for refugees to come in, then ?

407
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,720
That is the point here.

408
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,040
For all of their talk about how fine
they are with legal immigration,

409
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,760
this administration has worked
to reduce it across the board.

410
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,360
In his first year,
Trump supported a bill

411
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,360
that would've cut legal immigration
into this country by half.

412
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,600
While that bill went nowhere,
he's made countless procedural tweaks,

413
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,320
gumming up the process
for coming here legally.

414
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,960
The time to process an application
has jumped 46 percent since 2016.

415
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,480
Some immigration attorneys are calling
those changes "the invisible wall".

416
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,120
Last month,
Trump put another brick in that wall,

417
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,440
when the administration issued
the "public charge rule",

418
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,920
making the path to permanent residency
much more difficult

419
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,480
for any would-be immigrants who fails
to meet income standards

420
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,960
or is deemed likely to use public
assistance like food stamps,

421
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,760
public housing or Medicaid.

422
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,920
That could change who gets to call
this country home,

423
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,600
advantaging the well-off

424
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,160
and disadvantaging anyone they
ever think might have greater needs.

425
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,840
When Ken Cuccinelli, director of U.S.
Citizenship and Immigration Services,

426
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,040
was asked how this could square
with America's ideals,

427
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,440
his answer wasn't great.

428
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,160
Would you also agree
that Emma Lazarus' words,

429
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,760
etched on the Statue Of Liberty,
"Give me your tired your poor"

430
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,880
are also part of the American ethos ?

431
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,880
They certainly are.
Give me your tired and your poor

432
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,800
who can stand on their own feet
and not become a public charge.

433
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,200
Hold on there.
That's not what it says, is it ?

434
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,160
You can't just add lines to a poem
that invalidate its premise.

435
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,040
You can't say:
"In the words of Emily Dickinson:"

436
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,360
Because I could not stop for Death
He kindly stopped for me.

437
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,760
And then we totally fucked a lot,
Death has a big, fat Dick.

438
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,120
You're fundamentally changing
the intended meaning.

439
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,200
It's not just that his addition
is terrible.

440
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,800
What he took out is important:
"Give me your tired, your poor,"

441
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,680
"Your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free."

442
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,880
America at its best isn't about
who you are when you arrive,

443
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,720
it's about who you want to become,
the yearning part counts.

444
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,520
That doesn't have to mean

445
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,080
that everyone who wants
to come gets to come.

446
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,760
If you are going to say
"get in line" to people,

447
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,440
make sure they have
a line to stand in.

448
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,720
Now, these are the only
pathways that exist.

449
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,200
We should be having
a serious conversation

450
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,600
about whether they work smoothly
enough, which they do not,

451
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,640
if it's a balance between categories
and if we've defined them correctly.

452
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,040
Trump has made it pretty clear
that his ideal system would be

453
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,040
in two tiers, split evenly between
rich Norwegians and future wives.

454
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,360
I think a lot more people
should be let in in general,

455
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,560
but I will admit: this is subjective
and I am biased here.

456
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,880
I have been through this system,
it's rough.

457
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,040
When I finally got my green card,
it was sent to "The Daily Show"

458
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,240
and they surprised me with it
at work, presenting it to me

459
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,800
with a slice of apple pie
and a Budweiser as a joke.

460
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,240
I was so relieved,
I nearly burst into tears.

461
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,120
I had been worried about
my immigration status every single day.

462
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,000
And I was very lucky,
I had a lot of help,

463
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,680
and more importantly,
I had a path to come here.

464
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,480
It's the path that has led us all

465
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,440
to "Sad Zazu's Mildly
Interesting Explain Train."

466
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:22,320
For many people, there is no way
to "come in the right way".

467
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,760
If I was one of them, and Trump told me
to just get in line

468
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,560
and come in the right way,
I would've been well within my rights

469
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,640
to quote the other immortal
words of Emily Dickinson:

470
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,800
"Hope' is the thing with feathers,"

471
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:40,240
"Also, you don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, you idiot !"

472
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:45,960
"Death has a big, fat Dick."
And now, this.

473
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,680
Prepare To Be Interrogated By
Investigation Discovery's Joe Kenda.

474
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,720
I'm Lieutenant Joe Kenda.
I never know where a case will lead

475
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,600
but I'll never stop
until it's solved.

476
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,320
I treat people fairly
but I'm also ruthless.

477
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,800
I can be quite intimidating
when I want.

478
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,200
Do you think he walked out of your car
and ran into a knife six times, Mike ?

479
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,800
Run that by me again, Eric !

480
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,360
You understand what that means !
Mark, I'm embarrassed for you.

481
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,520
Kevin, I'm starting to have
a relationship now with you.

482

Christopher, I could
kiss you on the mouth.

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,240

mother and she's dead for 11 years.
