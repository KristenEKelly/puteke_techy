00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,200
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,120
SEASON VI
EPISODE 12

3
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,220
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,160
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,110
A quick recap of the week,
which has been busy in the U.S.,

6
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,170
from the advancement of more
anti-abortion bills

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,230
to Treasury Secretary and
thirst-trap Steve Mnuchin

8
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,060
withholding
Trump's tax returns.

9
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,120
It has been very depressing
here in America, so instead,

10
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,200
let's start overseas, with
the Eurovision Song Contest.

11
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,020
Basically, "America's Got Talent",
minus the "America"

12
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,220
and, frequently, the talent.

13
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,160
Last night's finale was the usual
festival of campy pop music,

14
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,160
featuring a Russian serenading
a rainy window,

15
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,140
an Azerbaijani contestant having
robotic heart surgery

16
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,040
and an Australian dressed
as Elsa from Frozen on a stick.

17
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,050
The most striking performance
came from the Icelandic entry,

18
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,010
who went
a very different way.

19
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,210
That's lovely. Finally we have
an answer to the question:

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,150
what if you'd sprinkled fairy dust
onto a Criss Angel show?

21
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,220
That was the magnificent Icelandic
band "Hatari".

22
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,070
I'll let them describe
what they're about.

23
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,150
We are Icelandic
award-winning anticapitalist

24
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,210
techno performance BDSM
band Hatari.

25
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm so glad you cleared
that up, guys.

26
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,030
I'd assumed that you were
a Norwegian award-nominated

27
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,010
proto-fascist industrial BBW
MILF DP band,

28
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,230
but apparently I was
sorely mistaken on that.

29
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,170
Hatari got attention by ignoring
Eurovision's history to be apolitical.

30
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,190
The lead singer described
qualifying for the contest

31
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:23,190
as bringing them "one step nearer,
to our plan to destroy capitalism."

32
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,040
If you think: "What qualifies
them to discuss geopolitics?"

33
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,240
It's actually in their blood.

34
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,000
This young man here,
apparently is the son

35
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,090
of the Icelandic ambassador
to the U.K.

36
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,110
Do you have anything to say?

37
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,130
You may think
that's the most embarrassing child

38
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,140
of a prominent political figure,
but let me remind you

39
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,010
the continued existence
of Meghan McCain.

40
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:52,200
No! I bet her husband's
gonna get so mad at me now!

41
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,180
What is he gonna tweet and delete?
I can't wait to find out!

42
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,170
I would love to spend
all night talking about Hatari,

43
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,920
but we have
to move on to China,

44
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,880
home of the world's most famous
big expensive wall that didn't work,

45
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,740
for now.

46
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,700
Trump raised tariffs on $200 billion
worth of Chinese goods,

47
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,910
marking another escalation in
a seemingly intractable trade war.

48
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,700
U.S. farmers and manufacturers
are starting to suffer,

49
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,720
Trump insists everything's fine.

50
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,710
Our farmers will be very happy,
our manufacturers will be happy

51
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,730
and our government
is very happy

52
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,790
because we're taking in tens
of billions of dollars.

53
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,710
It's working out very well.

54
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,870
It is alarming whenever Trump
claims something's going well.

55
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,770
If you ever hear him say: "We love
this building! So little fire!"

56
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,780
get the fuck out of there,
it is about to burn to the ground.

57
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,840
Trump's line there about
"tens of billions of dollars" reflects

58
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,900
his longstanding belief that
China is paying tariffs to the U.S.A.

59
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,900
Which, for the millionth time,
is not how tariffs work.

60
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,680
China doesn't pay our tariffs,

61
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,720
American importers do
when they receive Chinese goods

62
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,770
and they usually pass that
cost along to U.S. consumers.

63
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,840
Something that chief economic
adviser, Larry Kudlow,

64
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,740
reluctantly admitted
to when pressed on it.

65
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,780
It's U.S. businesses and
consumers who pay, correct?

66
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,720
Yes, to some extent,
I don't disagree with that.

67
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,730
"I don't disagree with that?"
That's a pretty laid-back way

68
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,710
to admit that Trump's entire
argument is bullshit.

69
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,910
Saying China pays tariffs

70
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,760
is like saying the cashier at
Subway pays for your sandwich.

71
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,760
No, you pay for it! And
you actually pay three times:

72
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,780
once at the counter, again
when you're sadly eating it

73
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,850
and finally,
two and a half hours later.

74
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,830
You pay three times.

75
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,720
It's an open question whether
Trump knows this, and doesn't care

76
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,830
or whether Trump doesn't know
this, and it's the second one.

77
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,900
When one reporter asked officials

78
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,720
whether Trump truly thinks
that China pays U.S. tariffs,

79
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,890
the consensus was: "yes,
that's what he actually believes."

80
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,730
Which is pathetic, because
these tariffs and this trade war,

81
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,740
are now
having real consequences.

82
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,580
While Trump said that
"our farmers will be very happy",

83
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,620
when reporters went to talk to
some, they found a different story.

84
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,530
What is the situation
for you and your operation?

85
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,760
Two words. It sucks.

86
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,590
Yeah, and "it sucks"
is not usually what you say

87
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,740
when you're very happy, unless
is 1901, you are Hubert Cecil Booth

88
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,640
and you just invented the world's
first power vacuum cleaner.

89
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,540
"I'm so happy!
It sucks so much!"

90
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,620
"I'm gonna be rich! By George,
it sucks! It sucks so hard."

91
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,680
The worrying thing is that
clearly nothing's going to change.

92
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,600
Trump is 72 years old,
if he hasn't shown any interest

93
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,690
in learning how trade works,
he's not about to start learning now,

94
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,640
leaving us in the ridiculous position
where the current president of the US

95
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,540
may have a less-informed
take on global economics

96
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,680
than a leather-wrapped Icelandic
dystopian techno band.

97
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,620
And now, this.

98
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,770
A Few More
Moments of Hatari.

99
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,780
It's not easy to work
towards ending capitalism.

100
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,710
The appetite of fascism
is a hopeless cry

101
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,820
for the remnants
of the nation-state,

102
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,750
which is, of course,
doomed to fail.

103
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,610
If you're full of warm and joyful
feelings, of color and spritely energy.

104
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,840
My celebrity crush this year
is Theresa May.

105
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,810
Please contact me
at capitalism@Hatari.is.

106
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,800
We address our statement
to Benjamin Netanyahu.

107
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,600
We, members of Hatari,
hereby challenge you

108
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,750
to a friendly match of traditional
Icelandic trouser grip-wrestling.

109
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,630
In a contest such as
the Eurovision,

110
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,840
it's important to invest
in a younger generation.

111
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,820
It's also true when you're
toppling a socio-economic world order.

112
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,770
All the children that support us,
they see our cause and our message.

113
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,470
We love children and smiling and
dancing among friends and family.

114
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,520
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns death:

115
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,430
one of the few things
in life you can't avoid,

116
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:21,420
along with taxes and plugging in
a flash drive upside down on first try.

117
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,410
Statistically, it can't be done.

118
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,500
This story is about the people
who investigate deaths.

119
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,460
If you're thinking:
"I don't want to see that on TV",

120
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,370
are you completely sure?

121
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,420
Death investigators aren't just
characters on some popular shows,

122
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,340
like "Law &amp; Order: SVU",
"CSI" and "NCIS",

123
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,360
every once in a while, they
even get a show of their own.

124
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,360
Think you can get away with
murder? Over her dead bodies.

125
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,350
ABC's "Body of Proof".

126
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,420
Smart is better when it's partnered
with sexy, "Rizzoli &amp; Isles."

127
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,290
I'm New York City's
top medical examiner.

128
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,340
It's like I've been doing this
forever. Well, actually, I have.

129
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,410
"Forever."

130
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,420
Yes, "Forever". Which is also
precisely the wrong answer

131
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,890
to the question: "how long
was that show on television?"

132
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,870
But it is not just TV death
investigators who are very busy.

133
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:16,070
In real life, every year, about
2.8 million Americans die.

134
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,060
A physician is the one who writes

135
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,010
what happened to them
on the death certificate.

136
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,040
If someone dies under
unnatural circumstances,

137
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,940
their body may be sent
for further examination

138
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,940
and possibly
a forensic autopsy.

139
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,060
That's what happens to around
half a million bodies each year.

140
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,060
Those investigations
are incredibly important.

141
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,030
A death certificate
isn't like a degree from USC,

142
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,980
it actually means something.

143
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:44,040
Autopsy results
have huge implications,

144
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,860
there's the obvious one like
determining whether someone

145
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,070
has been killed
and if so, how.

146
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,030
They help identify new
trends in substance abuse,

147
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,910
warn us about defective products
and they can sound the alarm

148
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,890
when they spot the spread
of an infectious disease.

149
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,970
People in this field
take that responsibility seriously.

150
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,940
We're on the front line
of what people are dying of.

151
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,450
We see it every day and we
notice a trend pretty quickly,

152
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:13,280
so we like to get the information
out as soon as possible

153
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:17,410
so that others are aware, maybe
prevent a few deaths if we can.

154
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,290
An important point about the
public-health role of her office,

155
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,370
only undercut by the skeleton
of Santa Claus behind her,

156
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,250
who it seems for some reason
died with his dick in a box.

157
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,480
While it would be great if those
autopsies were always performed

158
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,330
and overseen responsibly, as
local news regularly shows us,

159
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,310
that is by no means the case.

160
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,420
Tucked away in a storage
unit in Pensacola,

161
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,260
authorities found more
than a hundred human organs.

162
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,460
The renter of the unit, former
medical examiner Michael Berkland.

163
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,310
The family of an elderly murder
victim is not happy.

164
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,380
They found out that two,
now former, GBI employees

165
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,360
took a picture holding the dismembered
head of their loved one.

166
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:07,260
We can't show you that
picture because it is too graphic.

167
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,380
Shelly took the Marine's brain
home with him to Virginia,

168
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,530
and letting his kids play with it
while his wife took pictures.

169
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:19,380
That's an appalling story for
a number of reasons, but most of all:

170
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,500
why did his wife
take pictures?

171
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,450
What was she going to do with
them? Post them on Facebook?

172
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,350
With what caption?

173
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,520
Jackson and baby Timothy
handling a brain.

174
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,380
Daddy is always bringing home
a new organ for them to molest.

175
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,550
Hashtag #growingboys,
hashtag #godisgood".

176
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,410
While those are just individual
examples of what can go wrong,

177
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,350
the problems are broader,
with reports finding

178
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,410
"many death-investigation
facilities are antiquated"

179
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,480
"and in need of repair
or replacement."

180
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,350
Given how important
those facilities are,

181
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,450
it is shocking how often
they're funded as an afterthought.

182
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,320
The U.S. government provides
virtually no funding

183
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,330
to either medical examiners
or coroners.

184
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,420
One of their grants was for
one office to get a new refrigerator

185
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,380
because their current refrigerator
was closed by a belt.

186
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,710
That's how poorly funded.
I, myself, have worked in an office

187
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,710
where it was a converted garage
with a single light

188
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,780
dangling from the roof,

189
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,770
a single light bulb
over my autopsy table.

190
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,660
That is, quite frankly,
too spooky.

191
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,660
If I've learned anything
from horror movies,

192
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,760
when you see a room
with one dead person,

193
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,800
one alive person
and one light bulb,

194
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,600
that's a room
that's about to contain

195
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,610
two dead people
and one light bulb.

196
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,610
Learn from movies.
So tonight,

197
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,620
let's talk about
our death investigation system.

198
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,770
How it works, why it's such a
mess, and what we can do about it.

199
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,780
You should know that, depending
on where you live, or indeed, die,

200
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,760
you could wind up funneled
into one of two systems.

201
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,590
Two-thirds of the country's
death investigation offices

202
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,570
are overseen by coroners, while
medical examiners oversee the rest.

203
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,700
You might think that those
are the same thing

204
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,300
and they do have
the same job.

205
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,330
They decide whether to have
someone conduct an autopsy

206
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,240
and then using it to rule on
the cause of death.

207
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,320
There is a key difference
between them,

208
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,270
when it comes
to qualifications, in particular.

209
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,200
Medical examiners are required
to be doctors,

210
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,260
coroners are usually
not medically trained at all.

211
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:35,160
In Georgia, out of 154 coroners
only one is a physician,

212
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,290
while the others include
grocers, farmers, handymen

213
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,330
and hairdressers,
which is a little bit weird.

214
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,200
No disrespect to hairdressers,
but some have been known

215
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,220
to drop the ball
from time to time.

216
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:52,130
It has happened,
mistakes have been made.

217
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,350
If you are wondering how grocers
and hairdressers became coroners,

218
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,130
In Georgia, as in much of the country,
coroners are elected.

219
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,340
And the bar to run
for the job can be very low.

220
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,330
In Arkansas,
there is barely a bar at all.

221
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,230
You can run and be elected
with zero medical knowledge,

222
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,180
anatomical training
or official certification.

223
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:20,550
You have to be 18 years or older.
Cannot be a felon. You're electable.

224
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,580
Holy shit. Look to your right.
Now look to your left.

225
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,510
Both these people
are eligible to be,

226
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,440
and indeed are,
coroners in Arkansas.

227
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,500
Having elected officials
with no medical training

228
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:38,500
signing off on death certificates,
is weird enough,

229
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,500
before you factor in the potential
for huge conflicts of interest.

230
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,420
In some jurisdictions, the coroner
is also the county sheriff

231
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,500
and that has led
to serious problems.

232
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:53,580
In California, one doctor quit,
claiming the coroner-slash-sheriff

233
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,590
had interfered in cases where
police had used deadly force.

234
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,600
Dr. Bennet Omalu, renowned
for his expertise on concussions

235
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,480
accused San Joaquin County
sheriff and coroner Steve Moore

236
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,360
of trying to change autopsy findings
in shootings involving his officers.

237
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:14,540
That is not good. It is hard
to trust a death certificate

238
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,600
in a death involving
police officers,

239
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,390
when the guy signing it have an active
interest in police not being culpable.

240
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,320
Also when the guy signing it

241
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,340
looks like Marlon Bundo made
a wish to become a real boy

242
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,560
and it backfired horribly.

243
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,530
That sheriff denied
doing anything improper,

244
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,450
but they've taken coroner
duties away from the sheriff's office.

245
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,360
Which is good, because you can't
have any suggestion of coziness

246
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,340
between death investigators
and law enforcement.

247
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,450
In New Orleans, their coroner
for decades was Frank Minyard,

248
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,430
who was criticized for finding that
people who died in police custody

249
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,560
had suffered accidents,

250
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,510
and when he was confronted over
one case, he got pretty annoyed.

251
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,510
When the body of Henry Glover
was found in this burnedout car,

252
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,540
evidence pointed to police officers
being responsible for his death.

253
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,340
But Coroner Minyard did not
classify it as a homicide

254
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,390
and so there was
no criminal investigation.

255
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,340
A burned-up body
inside a burned-out car?

256
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,560
- Behind a police station?
- Okay, look at it that way.

257
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,420
Now, look at it from
my point of view.

258
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,320
We can't say.

259
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,440
There's no way I can say
that that is a homicide.

260
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,520
There's no way of telling
how, why this man died.

261
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,520
Except, there is a way
to tell how that man died:

262
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,430
a medical investigation
into his death,

263
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,300
which happens to be
your exact job.

264
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,370
Like hearing a clown say:
"There is no way to twist"

265
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,450
"this balloon into
a shape of a dog or hat."

266
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,410
Really, clown? If that's true,
what exactly is the use of you,

267
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:57,280
other than psychologically damaging
children for life?

268
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:02,490
That case was later re-classified
as a homicide, because it was.

269
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,390
It is no wonder

270
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:08,380
that medical organizations have
been calling for the coroner system

271
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,520
to be abolished since 1857,

272
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,280
arguing that the person appointed
should be a doctor in medicine,

273
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,420
essentially,
the medical examiner system.

274
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:22,500
Instinctively does sound better!
Even this system is not perfect.

275
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,230
The place where staff
posed for photos with a severed head?

276
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,280
That was
a medical examiner's office.

277
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,250
The guy who took the brain
for his kids to play with?

278
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,310
He was and still is
a medical examiner.

279
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,320
And that's not even
mentioning the medical examiner

280
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,260
at the center of the most fantastic
"20/20" interview of all time.

281
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:45,350
The other charge is that your dog
ate one of the body's spleen

282
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,290
and then he also
ate a kidney, is that true?

283
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,360
Dr. Harlan?
You don't want to respond?

284
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,350
You can deny this if it's not true.

285
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,190
It's never happened to me
in an "ABC News" interview,

286
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,170
but Charles Harlan
fell completely silent.

287
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:12,270
He didn't get up and leave.
He just simply stopped talking.

288
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,380
What are you doing?
You're still on camera!

289
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,300
I know he's not used
to dealing with the living,

290
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,230
but playing dead
is not a legitimate move here.

291
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:27,340
Good medical examiners
can be hard to find,

292
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,400
it's not a job
many doctors want.

293
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,350
You've seen the problems of
underinvestment in the facilities,

294
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:37,260
state-funded medical examiners
make around half the salary

295
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,370
they could
in other medical specialties,

296
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:43,170
with little potential for tips
from satisfied clients.

297
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:47,270
That is just if you're happy
with any doctor in the job.

298
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,160
The best-case scenario

299
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:54,260
is to have board-certified forensic
pathologists running these offices.

300
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,170
But that is not going
to happen anytime soon,

301
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,230
there is a dire
shortage of those.

302
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,390
There are only 500 of them
practicing in the whole US,

303
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,320
which is less than half
the recommended number.

304
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,290
When you combine this shortage
with the current opioid crisis

305
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,270
causing an increase in bodies
that need examining,

306
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:16,280
you get a system pushed
well past its breaking point.

307
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,250
In New Jersey a few years back,
their acting state medical examiner

308
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,250
resigned in frustration, citing staff
shortages as one of the reasons.

309
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,720
I felt as I walked in the door
they didn't have enough personnel

310
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,590
to handle the load.

311
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,670
You don't want to come
to a family and say:

312
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,550
"I'm sorry ma'am.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Smith."

313
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,610
"We couldn't do the investigation
'cause we don't have the resources."

314
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,750
Right. He wanted to serve people
well. But he couldn't.

315
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,590
Things have not got much better
in New Jersey since.

316
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:51,690
If you find yourself dying there, write
whatever is killing you on a Post-It

317
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,600
and stick it to your chest.

318
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:57,580
You'd be doing their overstretched
investigators a solid. Thanks.

319
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:02,520
The resources crunch is so bad
that some offices wind up

320
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,650
outsourcing work
to private contractors.

321
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,640
This is where this story
gets incredible.

322
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,630
Let me introduce you to one
terrible example of this.

323
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,620
In Missouri and Kansas, a number
of coroners offices wound up hiring

324
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,630
a company belonging to this man,
Shawn Parcells, to perform autopsies.

325
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,690
Why wouldn't they?

326
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,740
He's a guy whose actual license
plate says "Autopsy".

327
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,530
That's reassuring, isn't it?
They don't just hand that out

328
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,630
to anyone with a valid,
government-issued photo ID and $45.

329
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,440
No!

330
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,470
Unfortunately, though, there
were a few problems with Parcells.

331
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,510
He's not a forensic pathologist.
He's not any kind of doctor at all.

332
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,500
While he maintains
that his firm employs doctors,

333
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,610
he's been accused of performing
illegal autopsies himself.

334
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:50,530
He has left a long trail
of problems behind him.

335
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:54,530
Parcells has been accused of
botching a murder investigation.

336
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:59,420
We cannot use any evidence found
from the autopsy in a court of law.

337
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,580
And lying about his credentials.
Did you think he was a doctor?

338
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,430
- Yes.
- Why?

339
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,410
Because he said so.

340
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,530
I tell people all the time:
"I almost became a neurosurgeon."

341
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:14,620
Doesn't mean that I'm a doctor,
that I was in medical school.

342
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,480
I really did almost do that.

343
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,470
Wait.

344
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,410
You almost became
a neurosurgeon but didn't,

345
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,550
which puts you in a special
category of literally everyone

346
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,640
except fucking neurosurgeons.

347
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:36,450
I can also claim I almost
became a neurosurgeon

348
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,560
which is why my parents
are almost proud of me.

349
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,650
If you are wondering why
a county coroner office

350
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:48,680
would hire Shawn's company,
many of them are strapped for cash

351
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,510
and one of them explained:
"It was the most affordable."

352
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,560
Shawn's low rates become
understandable when you see

353
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,520
one of his autopsy facilities,

354
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,470
which he was comfortable
letting cameras in.

355
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:05,520
Parcells gave us a tour. He's proud
of this back-alley autopsy lab.

356
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:12,620
So this is the autopsy suite.
And obviously bathroom.

357
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,470
There's carpet on the floor, what
appears to be a lack of organization

358
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,480
and this is how containers
are labeled and stored.

359
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,480
I don't know where...
She's over there, so just...

360
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,680
We agreed to not record
a woman's body

361
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,540
that was unwrapped
and unrefrigerated in the corner.

362
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,640
The freezers.

363
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,500
And it couldn't be, because
there's no walk-in refrigerator

364
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,460
inside this makeshift morgue.

365
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,530
Only two small freezers that could
be purchased at any big box store.

366
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:46,500
What jumps out at me the most
about Shawn's tricked out death-hutch

367
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,650
isn't the single Glade PlugIn

368
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,520
or the name "Shawn"
surrounded by green hearts

369
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:56,460
or the Tupperware containers of
baked ziti and-or human remains

370
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:01,540
or the presence of a spray bottle
of Scrubbing Bubbles Bathroom Cleaner

371
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:06,550
or the sick "Lab Of Nerds" poster
or the sicker Albert Einstein poster

372
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,670
opposite the room-temperature
cadaver or the desktop skull

373
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,530
or the unfolded beach towel
or even the wall-to-wall carpeting.

374
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:19,460
No. Even within a grifter's
back-alley autopsy shanty,

375
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,600
the most objectionable item
on display there

376
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,530
is somehow
that enormous soda.

377
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,650
What are you doing with that
thing, you fucking monster?

378
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:33,460
This repurposed ramen container
could and I have to assume does

379
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,320
contain blood, phlegm and
embalming fluid

380
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,280
and yet it still would still be less
nauseating than the possibility

381
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,480
he's drinking a 40 of Squirt.

382
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,490
That's me speaking personally,
as well as correctly and objectively.

383
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:50,400
There is even more here.
Parcells has also gotten in trouble

384
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:54,400
for autopsies he's performed
through his private businesses,

385
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,440
for which he often failed
to produce any sort of report.

386
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:01,280
All of which has led to him
facing pending criminal charges

387
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,400
of theft
and desecration of bodies.

388
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,290
All of this has clearly given him
a bad name in the business.

389
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,520
Rather than stopping
what he was doing,

390
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,400
Shawn Parcells
stopped being "Shawn Parcells"

391
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,320
and instead, started working under
the name "Professor Lynn".

392
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,340
When that reporter asked him why,
his answer wasn't great.

393
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:29,290
Lynn was used as a nickname.
Honestly, I'm being honest here,

394
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,520
because people would
butcher my last name.

395
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,460
- "Parcells" isn't that difficult.
- It's not. It really isn't.

396
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,370
I've had people say
"Percellies", "Parcellies"...

397
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:45,510
When you're emailing, you don't
have to pronounce it out loud.

398
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:49,330
Why are you signing things
"Professor Lynn"?

399
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,470
It's my middle name.
I have that right.

400
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:58,320
First: that's clearly horseshit.
And second, the only person

401
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,550
who should be going by his
middle name is Hugh Grant,

402
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,470
whose middle name, and
this is true, is Mungo.

403
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,420
His actual name
is Hugh Mungo Grant

404
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:11,460
and for some reason
he chooses not to publicize that.

405
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,490
Like an idiot. You're looking
a gift horse in the mouth, Mungo.

406
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:22,530
As funny as Parcells is, and he is
distractingly, inconveniently funny,

407
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:27,360
he's botched multiple
death investigations.

408
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,320
The only reason he had
the opportunity to do so

409
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,360
was because of the Big-Gulp-sized
holes in death-investigation system.

410
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:39,380
It is not just dramatic consequences
of investigations being compromised

411
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,480
or epidemics
potentially being missed.

412
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,560
Even ordinary delays in processing
death certificates

413
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,360
can have serious practical
consequences for families.

414
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,350
You'd want a death certificate
within days or weeks.

415
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,520
But it can take
much longer than that.

416
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,380
Listen to one woman whose
husband had passed away suddenly,

417
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,480
and waited
six months for a cause of death.

418
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:04,320
They're not thinking of these
families that are waiting in agony,

419
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:07,500
to know what happened,
it's inexcusable.

420
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,530
The holdup
left Sara struggling financially.

421
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:16,390
Without the death certificate,
she couldn't collect life insurance.

422
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:21,560
I couldn't pay for the mortgage.
I had to rely on donations.

423
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,510
To you, it's much more
than just a piece of paper.

424
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,560
Yes, it meant moving on.

425
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,430
Awful. You shouldn't have to wait
that long for something important.

426
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,810
It's not like making someone
wait eight years to find out

427
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,000
who wins
the game of thrones.

428
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,880
Don't tell me who it is yet,
I haven't seen it.

429
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,940
Based on the season so far,
I'm guessing it was Ed Sheeran.

430
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,800
They really know how to deliver
for the fans. Don't they?

431
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,850
What should happen now?

432
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,970
In an ideal world,
no one would die.

433
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,910
I'm certainly never going to and
I don't think you should either.

434
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:01,800
In a slightly less ideal world, we
would phase out coroner's offices

435
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,910
and replace them
with medical examiners,

436
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,800
the thing that experts have
been arguing for since the 1800's.

437
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,910
We have autopsies performed by
board-certified forensic pathologists.

438
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:15,830
Not going to happen until we
address the huge personnel shortage.

439
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,890
You can't hire forensic
pathologists who don't exist.

440
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,900
We need to find ways to incentivize
med-school students,

441
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:28,800
paying them more and by funding
the offices they'll be working in.

442
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,850
It wouldn't even
cost that much.

443
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:35,860
One study recommended bringing
public spending on these offices

444
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:40,270
up to a minimum of just
$3.75 per person per year.

445
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:44,260
Less than the amount of money
that we annually donate

446
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,220
to our couch cushions.

447
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:51,200
This issue is tempting to ignore.
It combines the two things

448
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,320
that people hate thinking
about the most:

449
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,270
death and municipal funding.

450
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,210
Nobody wants to contemplate
their death or the death of loved ones.

451
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,290
Think about this
in a more abstract way.

452
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,360
Think about what you would
want for a beloved entertainer.

453
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,380
Not me, obviously,
that's the worst possible example.

454
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,170
Think of Beyoncé, or Ted Danson,
or Glenn Close.

455
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:17,230
Do you want Glenn Close to wind
up in Parcells' autopsy dungeon

456
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:20,220
or having her spleen being
eaten by a dog?

457
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,160
Of course not!
She's a seven-time Oscar nominee

458
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,240
and she doesn't want that to
happen either, do you, Glenn?

459
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,370
No, I don't want
my spleen eaten by a dog.

460
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,400
Show my spleen
some respect.

461
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,280
That's right, Glenn!
Put some respect on her spleen!

462
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,730
Put some respect
on that woman's spleen.

463
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:44,660
Glenn Close deserves three things:
two Oscars

464
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,760
and not to have
her spleen eaten by a dog.

465
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,870
That's the least
America can do for her.

466
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,740
We can and should improve our
death-investigation system,

467
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,760
for Glenn Close
and for every other person.

468
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,710
Not just because it's important,
which it is.

469
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,720
Not just because it could save
lives, which it could.

470
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,720
Because all it will cost us
is roughly the same price

471
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,760
as an extra-large Big Gulp.

472
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,790
And now this.

473
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:14,840
A Message About The Importance
Of Death Investigations

474
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,750
From Tracy Morgan.

475
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:21,680
This is Tracy Morgan. Can I talk about
something for a minute?

476
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,780
We all know that one day
we all won't be on this planet.

477
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:28,730
We're gonna die. I don't
know how I'm gonna die

478
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,800
but I know it's not gonna be
by a Walmart.

479
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,660
When my time does come,
I don't want to end up

480
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,640
in a basement dungeon
on some dude's autopsy table,

481
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,820
standing over me with a knife,
a dull spoon, an ice cream scooper.

482
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,780
I don't want these things.

483
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,880
Please don't let someone take
my brain home to play with.

484
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:49,870
That's not a good thing.
And I love this woman.

485
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,680
I cannot have some dog out here
eating Glenn Close's spleen.

486
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,700
Glenn Close is an American treasure.
I love you in "Albert Nobbs".

487
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,750
That's why we need you here.

488
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:06,720
All it's gonna take is $3.75
to save Glenn Close's spleen.

489
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:12,840
Right? Don't you want to save her
