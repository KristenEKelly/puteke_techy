00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,920
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,160
SEASON VI
EPISODE 29

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,840
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,440
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,480
We dive straight in this week
with Stupid Watergate II,

6
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,280
the scandal that's like getting
a rubber chicken stuck in your ass,

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,040
it's kind of funny,
but also actually serious

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,280
and something
needs to be done about it.

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,560
The House continued calling witnesses
ahead of public impeachment hearings.

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,880
But the president has figured out
who is really to blame

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,720
and chose his helicopter-yell time
to share it with everyone.

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,800
It's called the swamp.
And you know what I did ?

13
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,560
A big favor. I caught the swamp.
I caught 'em all.

14
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,600
Nobody else
could have done that but me.

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,480
That might be Donald Trump
at his Donald Trumpiest.

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,360
Screaming something nonsensical:
"I caught the swamp."

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,320
Then, doubling down on it:
"I caught them all".

18
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,800
And bragging
about how great he was

19
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,400
at doing something
that didn't mean anything.

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,360
Nothing there made any sense,
and yet you just know,

21
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,080
in two days his website will be sold
out of "I Caught the Swamp" hats

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,880
'cause that's the world
we live in right now.

23
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,760
That wasn't the most desperate defense
of the president employed.

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,880
That honor must go
to Lindsey Graham,

25
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,080
a man whose face looks like a nana
who found out what thruples are.

26
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,640
Graham knows the president
didn't demand a quid pro quo,

27
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,680
with some spectacular logic.

28
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,760
What I can tell you about the Trump
policy toward the Ukraine,

29
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,480
it was incoherent,
it depends on who you talk to.

30
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,360
They seem to be incapable
of forming a quid pro quo.

31
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,040
To be clear here:
Graham's defense has gone

32
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,160
from "there was no quid pro quo" to
"Trump is too dumb to do one."

33
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,960
That argument alone is terrifying.
Graham is essentially saying:

34
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,760
"The president's like a baby,"

35
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,720
"stumbling in a diaper
full of his own boom-boom !"

36
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,920
"That is why he must stay in office and
retain access to the nuclear codes !"

37
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,960
But while Stupid Watergate II
continues to unfold,

38
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,800
this week brought news from
the previous version:

39
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,960
"Stupid Watergate I:
Rise Of The Planet Of The Stupid."

40
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,440
The plot here
was pretty solid.

41
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,280
About the Trump
campaign's contacts with Russia:

42
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,080
who talked to whom
and what did the president know.

43
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,200
A lot came out
in The Mueller Report,

44
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,720
but certain details,
involving WikiLeaks,

45
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,880
were redacted because
they pertained to ongoing cases.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,520
One of those cases
reached a courtroom.

47
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,680
At the center of it is Roger Stone,

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,040
a steampunk Andy Warhol
who is in a lot of trouble.

49
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,800
Roger Stone's trial for allegedly
lying to Congress

50
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,720
got underway in a Washington, D.C.
courtroom today.

51
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,960
Federal prosecutors argued
that Stone lied to Congress

52
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,480
about his efforts to connect
with WikiLeaks in 2016

53
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,280
because the truth
looked bad for Donald Trump.

54
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,160
Roger Stone is accused of lying
to have the president's back.

55
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,480
Not to be confused with having
a lying president on his back,

56
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,000
because Stone has this actual tattoo,

57
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,800
which is the weirdest tattoo
I have ever seen.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,520
Not just because it's of Richard Nixon,
but because it is somehow

59
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,920
both too big and not big enough.

60
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,560
The placement of it is terrible.
It looks like someone center justified

61
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,840
a Nixon JPEG at the top
of a blank Word document.

62
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,880
Stone stands accused of misleading
Congress about efforts

63
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,000
to get information from WikiLeaks.

64
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,240
He claims that he never spoke
directly with Julian Assange

65
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,040
and testified in 2017 that
he'd relied upon an intermediary,

66
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,800
this man, Randy Credico,
a radio host and comedian.

67
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,400
Credico has denied
being that intermediary

68
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,640
and Stone has not reacted
well to that.

69
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,120
Prosecutors read Stone's messages
to Credico in court and they are rough.

70
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,880
Stone writes to Credico:
"You are a rat, a stoolie."

71
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,560
"You backstab your friends. I am ready.
Let's get it on. Prepare to die."

72
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,800
Holy shit.

73
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,720
It's unsurprising to hear mafia-style
threats coming from Roger Stone,

74
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,480
a man who looks like his entire
wardrobe consists

75
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,800
of mob boss Halloween costumes
from the discount rack at Party City.

76
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,360
Stone has argued that "prepare to die"
has been taken out of context.

77
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,040
He claimed the only reason

78
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,560
he said that was because Credico told
him he had terminal prostate cancer.

79
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,640
Except there's two problems:

80
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,480
Credico says he doesn't have
terminal prostate cancer.

81
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,800
Even if he did, that's a weird thing
to say to someone who does.

82
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,720
There is a reason
why hospital gift shops

83
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,920
don't sell
"Prepare To Die" balloons.

84
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,680
That's not something humans
tend to say to each other.

85
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,720
Stone is in some serious legal trouble.
And legal trouble costs money.

86
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,840
Don't worry,
he's got that covered.

87
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,720
You can help me in my epic struggle
for vindication and survival

88
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,600
by ordering a signed "Roger Stone
Did Nothing Wrong !" t-shirt.

89
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,400
Please order yours today.

90
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,840
That's ridiculous. Roger Stone did
at least one thing wrong

91
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,160
and that's making
that fucking t-shirt.

92
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,000
Two things wrong because,
you know, the tattoo.

93
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,920
In fact, three things wrong because
he wore this to the inauguration.

94
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,960
That's before we get
to the alleged crimes here.

95
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,200
I would argue a more accurate
t-shirt would probably say:

96
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,920
"Roger Stone Did
Literally Everything Wrong !"

97
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,880
Stone isn't just selling t-shirts
online to cover his legal costs.

98
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,680
You can also buy a hat,
a sporty tank-top,

99
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,840
a hoodie and a dog tag.

100
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,640
For those unable to wear anything
too political at work,

101
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,480
consider this nonpartisan
"I Love Porn Stars" t-shirt,

102
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,400
which "adds statement
to casually elegant appearance",

103
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,120
which is undeniably true.

104
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,880
Objectively, a statement
has been added there.

105
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,920
Specifically, the statement
"I Love Porn Stars".

106
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,760
You can't say it hasn't been !

107
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,280
But my favorite piece is without
a doubt this actual product:

108
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,760
a Roger Stone stone, an illogically
real item that consenting adults

109
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,240
can pay $12 for,
reduced from $15, by the way !

110
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,720
The stone is signed
by Roger Stone himself

111
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,720
and I did not think it was possible
for an ordinary rock

112
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,760
to somehow
become more worthless.

113
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,680
But this might be the perfect emblem
of this whole stupid time.

114
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,520
If one of the president's key allies
is a discount Dick Tracy villain,

115
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,320
we may as well
all face it at this point:

116
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,880
we've all hit
literal rock bottom.

117
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,800
And now this.

118
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,760
Conservatives' Favorite
Winston Churchill Quote.

119
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,600
"If you're not a liberal by the time
you're 20, you have no heart."

120
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,320
"Not a conservative by 40,
you have no head."

121
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,840
"20 and not a liberal,
you don't have a heart."

122
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,840
"40, not a conservative,
no brain."

123
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,920
Not a liberal in your youth,
no heart.

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,400
Not a conservative by 40,
you have no brain.

125
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,600
Not a liberal when you're
young and conservative when...

126
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,640
Not liberal when
you're young, you have no heart.

127
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,040
If you're not a socialist in your
twenties, you have no heart.

128
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,120
When you're in your twenties, if you're
not a socialist, you have no heart.

129
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,640
If you don't have a heart
when you're young,

130
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,040
when you're young
you need to have a heart.

131
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,760
When you're old you need a brain.
You're socialist when you're young.

132
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,160
"If you're still a socialist after 25,
you've got no head."

133
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,640
Who said that ?
Winston Churchill said that.

134
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,720
The French leader who started out as
a young radical himself once said:

135
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,960
"Any man who's not a socialist when
he's 20 has no heart."

136
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,800
"And anyone who's still a socialist
when he's 40 has no brain."

137
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,800
I think that was Churchill
but I'm maybe mistaken.

138
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,960
That was Clemenceau but it's often
misattributed to Churchill.

139
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,520
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns lawsuits,

140
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,040
why "Greta Thunberg
allegedly killed Jeffrey Epstein"

141
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,920
has the word "allegedly" in it.

142
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,360
We'll get to the main substance
of our story in a bit,

143
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,480
but I need to give you
a quick update on something.

144
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,040
In 2017, we aired a piece
on the coal industry

145
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,200
that touched on this man, Bob Murray,
the then-CEO of Murray Energy,

146
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,280
the largest privately-held
coal company in America.

147
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,080
We discussed
his closeness to President Trump,

148
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,200
his company's lawsuit to block a rule

149
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,880
intended to limit miners'
exposure to coal dust

150
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,800
and his insistence
that a deadly 2007 mine collapse

151
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,720
was the result of an earthquake,

152
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,000
something at odds
with a government investigation,

153
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,960
which found it was caused
by unauthorized practices.

154
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,000
Before the show went out, Murray's
attorneys had sent us two letters

155
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,720
warning us that if we aired
the story, he would sue

156
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,800
and threatening that "HBO
is in for the fight of its existence."

157
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,360
Might be true,
but not because of his lawsuit:

158
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,280
it's because "Game of Thrones"
prequels including

159
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,440
"Game of Thrones:
The College Years",

160
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,880
"Game of Thrones:
Winterfell Valley High"

161
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,480
and "Throne Babies: Battle For
The Rattle" will be out in a year.

162
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,000
HBO's gonna be fine.

163
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:34,480
We went ahead with the story
anyway, and this happened.

164
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,160
John Oliver is the target of a lawsuit

165
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,280
by one of the country's largest
coal companies.

166
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Oliver criticized Murray Corporation
and CEO Robert Murray

167
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,160
Sunday on his HBO show
"Last Night Week... Last Week Tonight".

168
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,880
It's true ! Bob Murray sued us

169
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,480
after that episode of "Last Night
Week Last Week Tonight" aired.

170
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,640
That's not the title of our show.
I expect better

171
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,320
from an esteemed program like
"CBS Morning Night This Morning".

172
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,680
You fuck up our name,
we fuck up yours.

173
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,800
That was over two years ago
and ever since,

174
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,560
the case has been in litigation,
we haven't been able to discuss it.

175
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,480
Murray dropped the lawsuit,
so I have some good news:

176
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,080
I can finally tell you
exactly what happened.

177
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,880
Which is honestly worth doing,
not only because it's a crazy story

178
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,520
but because it points
to a much bigger problem.

179
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,560
But first, a little background
on the lawsuit itself.

180
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,840
Murray listed what he found
objectionable in our piece,

181
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,760
including that we described him

182
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,600
as someone who
"looks like a geriatric Dr. Evil",

183
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,480
which we did, and he does.

184
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,840
We arranged for a staff member
to dress up in a squirrel costume

185
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,280
and deliver the message:
"Eat shit, Bob !"

186
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,920
I don't even remember that happening.
Can we for a moment check the tape ?

187
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,160
It's made out to: "Eat Shit, Bob !"

188
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,400
Fair enough, my mistake. We did it.
It's funny the things you forget.

189
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,080
That "Eat shit" check was
a reference to a real thing

190
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,640
that one of Murray's miners wrote
on a bonus check he received.

191
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,840
Murray had implemented
a bonus program to his miners

192
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,880
based on the amount
of coal they extracted.

193
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,760
His workers' union objected,

194
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,360
believing it would have an adverse
impact on safety in the mines.

195
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,760
When Murray did it anyway,
the miner returned his bonus check

196
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:31,200
of, by the way, 3.22 dollars
with the words "Eat Shit Bob" on it.

197
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,560
The company tried to fire him.
Which seems pretty excessive.

198
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,280
Maybe that message was an invitation
to eat at "Shit Bob",

199
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,040
the airport express version
of Bob Evans.

200
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,280
Need a slick biscuit and some soggy
sausage slop before your flight ?

201
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,800
Then you have gotta...

202
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,720
Come on down and eat "Shit Bob".

203
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,240
We've all heard the jingle.
Murray asked for damages,

204
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,000
he claimed that nothing has ever
stressed him more than our, quote:

205
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,080
"vicious and untruthful attack".

206
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,920
Which is an odd thing to say
given that he oversaw a company

207
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,640
whose mine collapse in Utah resulted
in the deaths of nine people.

208
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,320
It went on to say we attacked Murray,
he had no opportunity to defend himself

209
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,680
which is just not how
anything works.

210
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:23,280
After launching his lawsuit,
Murray defended himself, very publicly.

211
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,280
We'll pursue it to the fullest.
This is a tragedy

212
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,440
and American businessmen
had better take note

213
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,840
as to what they are trying
to do with me,

214
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,480
a guy who's done nothing
in his life but follow the law,

215
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,240
create jobs and do everything I could,
as best I could, for our country.

216
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,640
These people are evil.
They are very evil.

217
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,920
I think "evil" is a bit much there.
You can say a lot of things about me.

218
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,520
That I look like a toucan who
can't sleep without a night-light.

219
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,920
Or, that my voice sounds like Jude Law
if he had a kazoo stuck in his throat.

220
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,560
But "evil" seems
like a bit of an exaggeration.

221
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,280
The lawsuit was a bullshit
effort to silence us,

222
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,440
perhaps best exemplified
by a motion that Murray filed,

223
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,280
to try and get a gag order to prevent
us from rebroadcasting the story

224
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,360
or even having it up online.

225
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,600
The piece is still on the internet,
big time

226
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,520
and you can actually find it
at StillOnTheInternetBigTime-dot-com.

227
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,560
Just use the shortcut.

228
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,920
It was no surprise when the case
was dismissed

229
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,960
by the West Virginia judge
who heard it last February.

230
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,720
We figured this whole saga
was over, right ? Well, wrong.

231
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,880
Murray filed an appeal to
the West Virginia Supreme Court.

232
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,080
A fun side note:
one of the judges set to hear our case

233
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,760
was Justice Allen Loughry and that
name rang something of a bell for us.

234
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,920
We remembered that in 2015,
we did a segment on elected judges

235
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,560
that commented
on one of his campaign ads.

236
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,360
Here is a clip from that show.

237
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,520
I'm Allen Loughry and I'm
running for our Supreme Court.

238
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,000
It's Loughry as in "law" and "free".
This is my house. Come on in.

239
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,200
There's the kitchen.
Something smells good !

240
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,240
And my family room, my wife
Kelly and our son Justus Loughry.

241
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,320
- That's right. Justus Loughry.
- Yes, sir !

242
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,840
Yep, I call my son Justus.
I call my dog Preamble.

243
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,360
And I call my penis The Gavel.
Vote for me !

244
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,880
As far as things to say about a judge
before a ruling on your case goes,

245
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,440
claiming that he calls his penis
"The Gavel" is not the best choice.

246
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,920
Even though, look at him.
He clearly does.

247
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,960
We were concerned at this point,
but then, in a bizarre twist,

248
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,200
all four justices of the state
Supreme Court, including Loughry,

249
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,600
were impeached, in a scandal
over inappropriate spending.

250
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,520
Our case wound up sitting there for
over a year. Until a few months ago,

251
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,320
when Murray's team
offered to drop their lawsuit.

252
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,640
Murray Energy recently announced it
would be reorganizing under bankruptcy,

253
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,240
Bob Murray will remain
the company's chairman.

254
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,360
What was the point of him putting us
through this in the first place ?

255
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,000
It's because winning the case
was never really his goal.

256
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,560
That brings us to the larger issue
we're gonna talk about.

257
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,040
SLAPP suits.
SLAPP is an acronym

258
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,960
that stands for "Strategic
Lawsuit Against Public Participation".

259
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,640
These are frivolous suits
with no legal merit,

260
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,960
specifically designed
to stifle public debate or dissent.

261
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,080
These happen all the time.
Murray is not alone

262
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,160
in seemingly using lawsuits
to punish and intimidate critics.

263
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,400
One of his good friends
has openly called for changes

264
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,600
that would make it easier
to file them.

265
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,320
I'm gonna open up our libel laws,

266
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,600
so when they write purposely negative
and horrible and false articles,

267
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,880
we can sue them
and win lots of money.

268
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,120
We're gonna open up
those libel laws

269
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,960
and we're gonna have people
sue you like you never got sued before.

270
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,560
Trump has been as enthusiastic
about opening up libel laws

271
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,600
as he's been unenthusiastic about
opening up a present from Tiffany.

272
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,400
I know it's a tie, you know it's a tie.

273
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,840
The only thing that isn't a tie
is how much I love my daughters.

274
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,720
Trump is famously litigious
and has launched a number

275
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,000
of what I would argue
are SLAPP suits.

276
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,800
When Tim O'Brien reported
in a book that sources close to Trump

277
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,680
claimed his net worth was
much lower than he claimed

278
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,040
and only somewhere
between 150 to 250 million,

279
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,160
Trump did not take that well.

280
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,880
When the book came out,
he didn't feel very good about it

281
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,760
and he sued me for defamation.

282
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,520
It's the biggest libel lawsuit in U.S.
history. He sued me for $5 billion.

283
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,560
It's true. Trump sued
that man for $5 billion !

284
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,640
That means if Trump had won
that lawsuit,

285
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,000
he would have been
worth $5.2 billion !

286
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,520
That's a lot of money !
He'd be a billionaire !

287
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,000
Trump lost, of course,
and afterward, he openly admitted

288
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,160
that he knew he couldn't
win, saying:

289
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,560
"I did it to make his life miserable,
which I'm happy about".

290
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,640
Which honestly makes sense.
'Cause in Trump's heart,

291
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,640
he's just a vindictive,
bad man.

292
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,320
He's the kind who thinks
"Sophie's Choice"

293
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,240
is about a woman who got to give up
one of her children.

294
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,680
Trump's statement there gets at a key
characteristic of SLAPP suits.

295
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,760
The whole point is to put the defendant
through a difficult experience.

296
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,120
Even if cases fail in lower courts,
as they often do,

297
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,360
the plaintiffs can find ways to extend
them through discovery requests,

298
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,440
depositions, and appeals that drain
the targets' time and resources.

299
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,440
Journalists are not the only ones
targeted with SLAPP suits.

300
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,720
They can be used
to silence citizen activists.

301
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,200
Take the residents
of Uniontown, Alabama.

302
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,720
After a waste disposal company
agreed to store toxic coal ash

303
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,120
in a landfill near their homes,
some members of a local group

304
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,320
posted about their concerns
on their Facebook page.

305
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,160
In 2016, the company behind the
landfill sued four members of the group

306
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,480
for $30 million.

307
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,360
Which is a ridiculous
amount to sue anyone for,

308
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,480
let alone people living in a community
where the median household income

309
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,120
is just $14 000.

310
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,520
The attorney representing the landfill
claimed that that $30 million figure

311
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,960
wasn't actually as bad
as it sounds.

312
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,800
The $30 million I think has been,
it's actually, was 15.

313
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,000
There were two counts
but they each contained 15.

314
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,920
That's okay then !
Yeah, it's not $30 million !

315
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,840
It's two counts,
of $15 million.

316
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,720
Or, you could say it's five counts of
$6 million. Or 30 counts of 1 million.

317
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,360
Or 3 billion counts,
each containing one cent.

318
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,200
The point is: math is fun !

319
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,400
After the ACLU stepped in to help
the residents defend themselves,

320
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,840
the company
withdrew the lawsuit.

321
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,000
But the experience
left its mark on the community.

322
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,240
It has scared a lot of people
for speaking up,

323
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,120
those individuals are afraid
to get that backlash not knowing

324
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,960
that's just a scare tactic to get you
to leave things alone

325
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,680
so they can continue
to do what they want.

326
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,280
She's exactly right. But the problem
with scare tactics is that they work,

327
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,080
because things that could hurt you
are scary.

328
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,760
The only people who aren't scared
of anything look like this.

329
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,720
Look at that smiling idiot,
able to feel joy

330
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,640
'cause he believes,
more than anything in the world,

331
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,440
his soul has been liberated
from 75-million-year-old alien spirits

332
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,800
that a psychiatrist paralyzed under
the pretense of income tax inspections.

333
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,520
Seems nice, Tommy Boy,
seems real nice.

334
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,680
Pretty much everyone,
from judges to legal scholars,

335
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,240
agrees that SLAPP suits
are a scourge.

336
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,400
That is why 30 states have
some form of anti-SLAPP laws

337
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,800
enable defendants to force plaintiffs
to justify their claim early on.

338
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,000
And if they can't do that,
the case is not only dismissed,

339
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,800
but, in some states, the defendant
is then awarded attorney's fees.

340
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,280
When well crafted, these
laws can strike an important balance

341
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,800
between protecting legitimate claims
and deterring timewasting bullshit.

342
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,600
The problem is,
20 states don't have those laws.

343
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,080
With no federal
anti-SLAPP legislation,

344
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,400
plaintiffs can file a suit
in one of those states,

345
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,560
one of which is West Virginia.

346
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,280
That is where Bob Murray sued us,

347
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,440
despite the fact that neither he
nor I, live there.

348
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,000
We are far from the only critics
he's sued over the years.

349
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,720
Not the first time Murray sued
a journalist for unfavorably coverage.

350
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,680
According to "The Washington Post",
he's filed at least nine lawsuits

351
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,000
between 2001 and 2015
for reports they saw as critical.

352
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,760
Since Murray likes to sue,

353
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,000
we're not gonna say another word
about him as a journalist here.

354
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:14,840
I get that he is joking there,
but that is also the culture of fear

355
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,160
that Murray
may be trying to create here.

356
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,520
Lawsuits like his make people
think twice before reporting

357
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,800
on his business
or pointing things out,

358
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,120
like the fact that Murray's face
answers the question:

359
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,920
"What if an egg
was mentally undressing you ?"

360
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,960
I would argue...
Eyes up here, egg.

361
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:41,920
Some of Murray's suits have been
attempts to bully people into silence,

362
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,680
sometimes over incredibly
trivial slights.

363
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,720
He's sued an editorial cartoonist
over this unflattering cartoon of him.

364
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,360
Which is just pathetic.
Who sues a cartoonist ?

365
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,360
You think I'm gonna go to court
over this thing that I found online,

366
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,160
which appears to be me
presenting a tiered cake

367
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,240
made with syringes,
condoms and broken glass ?

368
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,120
I can only assume
that's a metaphor for this show,

369
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,160
in which case, nailed it,
no notes.

370
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:16,080
Murray has also sued this couple,
James and Lisa Ciocia.

371
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,280
In 2012, they held a protest outside
Murray Energy's Ohio headquarters,

372
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,760
with only about 20 people
marching around.

373
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,120
It looked like this.

374
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,360
And that has to be the least
intimidating protest I have ever seen.

375
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,160
One sign calls him "Mr. Murray"
and another is in serif font !

376
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,520
It's less a protest and more
an inter-office memo.

377
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,240
Murray sued not only the Ciocias
but also a local newspaper,

378
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,280
"The Chagrin Valley Times",
for their coverage of it.

379
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,400
Both the Ciocias and the newspaper
beat Murray's claims for defamation.

380
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,000
He tied them both up
in appeals for years.

381
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,720
The newspaper's defense cost
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

382
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,600
The appellate court judge explicitly
wrote in his decision

383
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:05,000
that Murray's suit shows why Ohio
should adopt an anti-SLAPP statute,

384
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,960
pointing out that the paper had
removed all their coverage of Murray

385
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,360
from their site,
which the judge said was

386
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,560
"an example of the chilling effects
a suit like this has."

387
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,520
And that is the point here... Lawsuits
are like famous Instagram pugs.

388
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,480
They don't have to work
to be considered very successful.

389
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,200
And by cultivating a reputation
for being aggressively litigious,

390
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,360
Murray may have
got what he wanted,

391
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,800
and successfully applied
a chokehold on how he is covered.

392
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,280
While it is hard to show you
an un-reported story,

393
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,480
we did stumble on
two ongoing lawsuits

394
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,200
involving Murray that
have got almost no press.

395
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,160
Which is strange, because
once you hear the details,

396
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,480
you'll agree
they probably should have.

397
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,680
Murray discloses that
two women who had worked for him

398
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,360
had alleged
"harassment and the perpetration"

399
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,000
"of a hostile work
environment by Mr. Murray".

400
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,680
He denies,
but also admits paying those women

401
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,960
considerable sums of money
in confidential settlements.

402
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,360
In a separate, ongoing lawsuit,
a different former employee

403
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,480
alleges there were attempts
by Murray to kiss her,

404
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,880
pulling her into him to, quote:
"cop a feel"

405
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,520
and calling her into his office
to give him hot water with lemon

406
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,240
while he was wearing
nothing but his underwear.

407
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,080
What possible thought process
could have led to that ?

408
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,560
Let's see, I'm horny, I've got
a little bit of a sore throat

409
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,840
and I'd like to solve both problems

410
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,760
in a way that makes a female
employee feel subhuman.

411
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,000
I've got it ! Bob, you've done it
again, you clever little coal goblin.

412
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:44,440
Wait, it gets worse. The same complaint
also claims Murray had the plaintiff,

413
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,840
get on her hands and knees to locate
or pick up items for him,

414
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,840
including one time when she was
required to find a small hard object

415
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,720
and he only told her
after she found it

416
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,960
that it was a kidney stone
he'd fished out of the toilet.

417
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,280
I know that
that is absolutely nauseating,

418
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,440
but remember, you chose this,
you all chose to be here.

419
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,600
Everyone in this audience
could have gone to see "Stomp".

420
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,000
Tickets are now available from $50 !
A great deal for a classic NY show.

421
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,280
It's not gonna blow your mind:
it's "Stomp".

422
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,800
But it's been around for
30 years for good reason

423
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,040
and that reason is at no point
do they force their audience

424
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,240
to imagine this man fishing out
his own kidney stone.

425
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,320
It's a good show.
Now I have to tell you,

426
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,440
Murray denies those allegations,
which he says are concocted

427
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,600
and claims the woman
is using the litigation as a vehicle

428
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,120
to harass and embarrass him,
to strong-arm him into a settlement.

429
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,040
I will also tell you that
one of her colleagues backed her up,

430
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,880
saying she told her the kidney
stone story at the time,

431
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,480
and had described Murray as screaming
at her to "find it, find it !"

432
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,560
What was possibly the rush ?
Was Murray honestly worried

433
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,640
that someone else was gonna
find his pee pebble first ?

434
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,800
I've got it ! Bob's cock rock !
I'm gonna be a millionaire !

435
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:18,440
It's hard to find the right response
to all of that once you've heard it.

436
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,640
I do think a seven-foot squirrel
quoting a justifiably angry miner

437
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,640
may have actually said it best.

438
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,160
Eat shit, Bob !

439
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,840
Exactly, beautifully put.

440
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:35,040
It's a little weird that these
lawsuits didn't get wider coverage.

441
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,160
These are serious allegations
of workplace misconduct

442
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,520
involving the chairman of the
largest private coal company,

443
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,480
a highly public figure who brags about
his closeness to the president

444
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,680
and his role in shaping
energy and environmental policy.

445
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:54,480
Organizations are justifiably wary
of getting sued by Murray.

446
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,440
Even if they are baseless,
his lawsuits can do major damage.

447
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:03,160
Ours wound up costing
over $200 000 in legal fees,

448
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,760
and even though our insurance covered
part of it and we were lucky

449
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,360
that HBO stood by us,
this lawsuit was infuriating,

450
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,200
took up a lot of time
and resources and resulted

451
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,920
in a tripling of our libel
insurance premiums,

452
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
despite the fact that
we fucking won this case.

453
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:29,320
We badly need effective anti-SLAPP
laws nationwide

454
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,520
to deter powerful people like
Bob Murray from using the courts

455
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,920
to shut down
people's legitimate dissent.

456
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,560
I know that after tonight,
Murray will probably sue us again,

457
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,880
even though everything I've said
has been vetted by our lawyers,

458
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,160
who, may I add,
are getting very tired with us.

459
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,600
When we reached out to Murray
to review the details

460
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,400
we planned to use,
he wrote a letter back,

461
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,640
not addressed directly to us
but to our bosses at AT&T and HBO,

462
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,960
saying we were
"falsely vilifying" him,

463
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,880
launching "scurrilous attacks"

464
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,040
and arguing that none
of his lawsuits are SLAPP suits,

465
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,720
which they absolutely are.

466
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,960
So, I guess, here we go again.

467
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,840
It is yet another Bob Murray attempt
to bully people into silence.

468
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,880
He's been doing this for decades.

469
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,680
I will stand behind our first piece,
and I'll stand behind this one.

470
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:25,200
As for the jokes that we made,
we are more than covered there.

471
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,200
The judge in our case pointed out
the Supreme Court has protected

472
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,040
loose, figurative language

473
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,000
that cannot reasonably be understood
to convey facts about someone.

474
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,400
Basically, jokes are fine.

475
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,080
It would be really tempting
to say a bunch of loose,

476
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,720
figurative things
about Bob Murray right now.

477
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:50,000
Not just on our behalf, but on behalf
of every small newspaper

478
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,920
and individual that he has sued,
of every employee ill-treated

479
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,560
and who may've wanted to tell him
to, say, eat shit, but couldn't.

480
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,600
I have some bad news
and some good news for you.

481
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,520
The bad news is, the last two years
have just been too exhausting,

482
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,680
so I am not going to say anything
more about Bob Murray.

483
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,480
The good news is, why would I,
when I can simply sing it instead ?

484
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,920
Maestro, please !

485
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,080
We went to court
against the world's worst sport.

486
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,880
And learned important lessons
on the way.

487
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,280
We spoke with perfect candor.
And got accused of slander.

488
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,600
'Cause Bob Murray
wants to make us pay.

489
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,680
So, even though he'll threaten
legal Armageddon,

490
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,600
We have just one tiny thing
to say:

491
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,320
Bob Murray can go fuck
himself today.

492
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,840
Ladies and gentlemen, to help me
respond to Bob Murray's bullshit,

493
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:59,960
please welcome to the show
the "Suck My Balls, Bob" Dancers.

494
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,600
Bob, watch this !

495
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,160
He went to the Louvre
and spit in Mona Lisa's face !

496
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,680
Filled a rocket
with puppies and he shot it into space.

497
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,240
He bludgeoned Nancy Kerrigan
and watched her cry for fun.

498
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,920
He murdered Archduke Ferdinand
and started World War I.

499
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,720
If we discuss Murray in a way

500
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,480
no reasonable person could
construe as factual,

501
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,760
we can say
whatever the fuck we like !

502
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,080
So, come on, everyone,
let's head to the streets.

503
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,160
He'll stroll into a stranger's home
and jizz right in their Wheaties.

504
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,560
He watches "Steel Magnolias"
and roots for diabetes.

505
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,920
He wrote the Macarena and
he dots his I's with hearts.

506
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,480
- And even worse, he likes to blame...
- Malala for his farts.

507
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,320
What's the big idea ?

508
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,720
We're using protected speech
to tell Bob Murray to eat shit.

509
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,040
The guy who dipped his balls
in my hot dog water ?

510
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,560
- That's exactly who I'm talking about.
- Can I bring my cart ?

511
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,360
- It's not ideal.
- It'll be fine if I leave it here ?

512
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,640
I don't know !

513
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,880
He doesn't like Tom Hanks.
He cut off Van Gogh's ear.

514
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,480
Told Hitler to quit painting
and to find a new a career.

515
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,520
- Masturbates to "Schindler's List".
- "Old Yeller" makes him hard.

516
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,520
He was Cosby's drug supplier,
Jeffrey Epstein's prison guard.

517
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,800
Stop, everybody. Please stop.

518
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,400
John, as HBO's legal counsel,
please stop.

519
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,720
I have something important to say.

520
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,280
One day at the M&M store,
Bob Murray walks through the door.

521
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,040
He wasn't wearing pants that day,
his dick and balls on full display.

522
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,840
He grabbed M&Ms from a bowl
and crammed them up his...

523
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,960
Anal hole.

524
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,160
He spread his butt cheeks far and wide,
he told the tourists to look inside.

525
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,080
He said my rectum's
full of treats.

526
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,560
Reach in there
and grab some sweets.

527
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,760
These are all real things
Bob Murray did.

528
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,840
See you in court, fuck face !

529
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,640
Look ! It's Mr. Nutterbutter.

530
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,320
We're singing about Bob Murray.
I believe you've heard of him.

531
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,560
- The Zodiac Killer ?
- That's the one.

532
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,720
My friends and I have
a little something to say about him.

533
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:32,440
Bob Murray is a furry.

534
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,840
Putting aside our personal quarrels,

535
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,760
- The man fucks...
- Squirrels.

536
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,520
The man fucks squirrels.

537
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,960
Eat shit, Bob.

538
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,400
I know where we should go !

539
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,960
Eat shit, Bob !

540
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,880
Bob, is this as bad as you feared ?

541
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,160
It doesn't count as slander
'cause it's way too weird.

542
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,760
We made up these anecdotes,
they're silly and insane.

543
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:19,440
It could go on and on and on.
And on, and on...

544
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,520
But we will stop this song we wrote.
We may have fried your brain.

545
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,680
So, eat shit, Bob !

546
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,600
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
