LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,720
SERIES VI
EPISODE 15

3
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,120
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,760
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,320
A quick recap of the week.
It has been ferociously busy,

6
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,440
protests in Hong Kong,
escalating tensions with Iran,

7
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,720
the lineup announced
for the first Democratic debates,

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,120
featuring 20 candidates,
which is a lot !

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,480
Some candidates still didn't make
the cut, one of whom,

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,800
something called "Montana Governor
Steve Bullock" took it hard,

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,800
releasing an ad featuring
a disgruntled supporter.

12
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,760
Yeah, I heard the news.

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,280
DNC saying Governor Bullock doesn't
qualify for the debates ?

14
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,080
That's horse...

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,200
Horseshit ?
A strong stance there, Steve !

16
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,320
Undercut by the fact that video
has 46 hundred YouTube views.

17
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,600
If your angry plea for attention
only gets 1/44th of the views

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,360
of an actual video of paint drying,
you might not deserve that attention.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,360
Let's not get dragged
into the 2020 race, instead,

20
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,560
let's move on to California: the state
so primed for its own destruction,

21
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,320
its seal features a man
digging his own grave.

22
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,640
I want to talk to you about
California Congressman Duncan Hunter,

23
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,080
whose photo I don't
even need to show you.

24
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,920
Even if you've never seen him, deep
down, you know what he looks like.

25
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,320
I'll prove it. Close your eyes.
Picture a "Duncan Hunter".

26
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,640
The thickness of his neck, the
wetness of his hair, the slack jaw

27
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,920
and the EarPods he won't take
out even while you give birth

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,520
to his first and only son.

29
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Open your eyes. Is this
what you're picturing ?

30
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,600
Of course, it is !
That is the face of a Duncan Hunter !

31
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,120
That is the face you'd get if a pair
of wrap-around sunglasses

32
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,440
fucked a sunburn.

33
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,360
It's the face of a man who would vape
during a congressional hearing,

34
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,160
which is something Hunter did
as a way of protesting legislation

35
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,760
that would ban
e-cigarettes on airplanes.

36
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,760
Of all the improvements one could
make to air travel,

37
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,120
"encourage vaping"
is absolute last on my list,

38
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,400
behind "allow karaoke"
and "add bugs".

39
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,560
Hunter and his wife Margaret have
been embroiled in a major scandal.

40
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,040
And last year,
he made a bold legal gambit.

41
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Embattled Duncan Hunter
appearing to implicate his wife

42
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,760
as he attempts to defend himself
against allegations that both used

43
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,240
a quarter of a million dollars
to pay for personal expenses.

44
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,560
She was also
the campaign manager.

45
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,520
Whatever she did on that,
that'll be looked at, too.

46
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,560
But I didn't do it.

47
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,760
Yeah. He totally
threw his wife under the bus.

48
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,440
Although, they had been
married for 20 years and that is

49
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,480
the "Let your spouse take the fall
for financial fraud" anniversary.

50
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,520
This week there was
a major development:

51
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,200
his wife actually switched
her plea to guilty.

52
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,320
Which has some potentially
huge legal implications.

53
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,960
Legal experts say a change of plea
almost certainly means

54
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,720
that she is now working
with prosecutors.

55
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,000
Shit. "She is now working
with prosecutors"

56
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,760
is one of the worst
things a politician can hear.

57
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,760
One of those phrases that indicates
rock bottom is around the corner,

58
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,840
like "They have you on tape" or
"You're polling behind Mayor de Blasio".

59
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,440
It is worth to revisit what
this scandal is about,

60
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,880
some of the details are astonishing.

61
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,560
Nearly $30 000 for family
vacations to Italy, Hawaii and Vegas,

62
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,280
more than $12 000 for fast food,
alcohol and groceries,

63
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,480
a trip to Sea World, their
kids' private school tuition,

64
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,600
payments to a family dentist classified
as "charitable contribution".

65
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,160
His wife spending $152
on makeup at Nordstrom,

66
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,600
"gift basket items for
the Boys & Girls Clubs of San Diego."

67
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,000
Claiming you visited the Nordstrom
"for the children" that's one thing.

68
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,440
Calling a dental appointment
"charity" is another.

69
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,480
But using misappropriated funds
to take a trip to whale Guantanamo ?

70
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:40,200
That is a dick move.
All of that was previously known

71
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,280
but there are some
new details now.

72
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,680
While we knew before the Hunters
used campaign funds to fly

73
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,520
their pet rabbit across the country,
thanks to his wife's plea deal,

74
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,960
we now know
that rabbit's name is Eggburt.

75
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,080
Which complicates
things for me.

76
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,800
While I've always assumed that
Duncan Hunter,

77
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,240
a man whose very face
screams "I don't tip",

78
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,120
is a despicable individual,

79
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,840
I now must accept
he has a rabbit named Eggburt.

80
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,160
Which is a very good name
for a rabbit.

81
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,800
Not as good as Mike Pence's
Marlon Bundo, but almost.

82
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,240
That's the sort of thing that
deserves to be the subject

83
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,240
of a doctoral thesis titled: "Why Do
Bad Men Name Rabbits Good ?"

84
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,560
"A Meditation on Bunny Nomenclature
in the 21st Century."

85
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,120
I'd read it.

86
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,720
This caps a rough
couple of months for Hunter.

87
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,720
In May, he defended
a Navy SEAL accused of war crimes

88
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,000
and admitted that, when
he was a Marine,

89
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,080
he also took photographs
with a dead enemy combatant.

90
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,360
He made this video
in an attempt to expose

91
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,640
the country's supposed
border issues.

92
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,400
This is it. It looks tough to cross.
Let me see if I can do it.

93
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,680
There we go.
And this is the border fence,

94
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,040
that you won't see
on the fake news media.

95
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,960
This is why we need a wall,
this is why Trump is right.

96
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,000
This is what we need to get rid of
and expand upon to secure the country.

97
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,960
While clearly,
he looks very cool there,

98
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,160
wandering around the desert
dressed in The North Face's

99
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,840
impending-divorcee collection,
if he just crossed the border there,

100
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,400
that would be a violation of a
judge's order to not leave the country.

101
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,240
Luckily for him,
that whole video was fake news,

102
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,480
that wasn't the border, just a vehicle
barrier 100 feet away from it.

103
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,440
Hunter either knew that there
and was lying.

104
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,600
Or he didn't, and is a blue ribbon
ding-dong dipshit.

105
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,720
We already know that
he's broadly both of those.

106
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,280
Which one was he in that moment ?
It's almost impossible to say.

107
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,800
Hunter insists that he's the victim
of a political conspiracy right now

108
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,920
and that he will be
cleared of all charges.

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,640
I don't want to get out
ahead of the court here,

110
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,320
but after reading
his wife's plea agreement,

111
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,560
if I may quote a certain disgruntled
man sitting in the trunk of his car:

112
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,080
That's horse...

113
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,520
It is. Exactly. And now, this.

114
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,960
Fox And Friends's Brian Kilmeade
Took German In High School !

115
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,640
"Hombre" translated
simply means "man".

116
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,440
He's talking about the border.
So, I understand it.

117
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,360
My choice to take German
has hurt me, right, again.

118
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,560
I did not know what "hombre"
I took German in high school.

119
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,800
We don't know Spanish.

120
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,880
If I didn't have subtitles...
I focused on German.

121
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,120
Guten tag to my German fans,
I took German in high school.

122
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,200
I took German in high school,
they didn't have drones ?

123
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,120
The German election results.
I'll take this story.

124
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,320
In "Der Spiegel," which is a
magazine I don't get, but it's German.

125
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,240
If I paid more attention in school,
I took three years of German.

126
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,040
It's like my second language.

127
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,520
My French is coming back
from high school.

128
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,440
I took German.

129
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,040
It's like
a second language to me.

130
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,400
I know you took
German in seventh grade.

131
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,000
Because I took German in high school.
Perfect.

132
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,040
In what country did the custom of
putting up a Christmas tree originate:

133
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,080
United States, Germany or France ?

134
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,920
Brian, you have your chance.

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,680
You know
what country that is ?

136
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,800
That would be Germany,
Deutschland.

137
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,800
Germany, Deutschland is correct !

138
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,840
Moving on.
For our main story tonight,

139
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,840
we'll focus on something
getting talked about a lot:

140
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,960
impeachment.

141
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,840
It's one of the most consequential
decisions a legislature can make,

142
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,400
but it's also an anagram
for "Pinch Me Meat",

143
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,320
which is the sentence that got the
Lucky Charms leprechaun Me Too-ed.

144
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,080
Ever since this president got elected,

145
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,640
people have been dying
to see him impeached,

146
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,720
sometimes literally, as this upbeat
"Inside Edition" clip shows.

147
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,040
Two people who passed away
recently died happily

148
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,480
after being led to believe
President Donald Trump was impeached.

149
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,160
According to the obituary for
Corliss Gilchrist from Des Moines,

150
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,240
loved ones told him before he died that
Trump's impeachment process began.

151
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,120
Further west in Oregon,
loved ones say this man,

152
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,840
75-year old Michael Elliott passed
away peacefully last month,

153
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,320
as soon as they told him
Trump had been impeached.

154
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,240
So first: great music choice
to cover two old men dying.

155
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,720
Perfect tone you set. That's
a sweet gesture from their families.

156
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,800
But why stop there ?
Dad, we all love you very much

157
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,680
and we wanted to tell you:
Trump has been impeached,

158
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,200
registered as sex offender,
stuffed into a tire by Mueller

159
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,840
rolled into the Potomac.

160
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,080
He got so dizzy and shit himself,
all at the same time.

161
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,600
They got it all on camera
and now it's a meme.

162
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,320
Have a good death, goodbye !

163
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,880
The impeachment hasn't been
employed as effective hospice care,

164
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,120
it's become a major talking
point among House Democrats,

165
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,760
with a rising number
coming out in favor of it.

166
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,400
63 of them now support
an impeachment inquiry,

167
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,120
and some, like Representative
Rashida Tlaib, have gone further.

168
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,200
We're gonna go in there and
we're gonna impeach the motherfucker.

169
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:15,040
It is startling to hear that language
from a congressperson.

170
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,400
I'd almost sooner expect to hear
"Impeach the motherfucker"

171
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,680
as an edgy new slogan
for peach iced tea.

172
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,080
Snapple, you were always
the nice tea ! This isn't you.

173
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,600
Not everyone in the Democratic Party
is quite as motherfucking enthusiastic

174
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,840
about the impeachment idea.

175
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,240
Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly attempted
to apply the brakes to an impeachment,

176
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,280
claiming the country is not behind it
and that in fact,

177
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,520
they barely understand
what it means.

178
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,000
Most people think impeachment
means you're out of office !

179
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,760
Did you ever get that feeling ?
Or are you in a bubble here ?

180
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,120
They think that you get
impeached, you're gone.

181
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,280
That is not true. It's not
the means to the end that people think.

182
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,920
All you do, vote to impeach.
Bye bye Birdie. Right ?

183
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,880
It isn't that.

184
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,200
Nailed it.

185
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,440
Nancy knows there is no better way
to connect with the average working Joe

186
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,840
than by referencing a
Broadway musical from 1960.

187
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,280
If this situation were to be a musical,
it wouldn't be "Bye Bye Birdie"

188
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,880
it would obviously be "Grease",
where a rapey guy with weird hair

189
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,640
treats women like shit, and yet
gets everything he's ever wanted.

190
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,240
Many people don't understand
what impeachment involves.

191
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,120
Might be a good time to discuss what
it is, why it may be warranted

192
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,960
and what the risks might be
in carrying it out.

193
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,280
As Nancy Pelosi just said,

194
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,400
impeachment in no way guarantees
a president's removal from office.

195
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,360
No president has ever
been removed through this process.

196
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,680
Two presidents have been impeached,
Clinton and Johnson,

197
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,200
but remained in office.

198
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,680
Nixon resigned on his own before
the House finished impeaching him.

199
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,000
Like an Irish goodbye,
if Nixon didn't also hate the Irish.

200
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,160
Here is how
the impeachment process works.

201
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,080
Typically, it begins with an inquiry
in the House of Representatives.

202
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,240
A committee investigates and holds
hearings into a president's conduct.

203
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,440
If a majority decides
they found impeachable offenses,

204
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,840
they vote to impeach, but that
moves the process to the Senate,

205
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,560
where a trial is held and the president
is only removed from office

206
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,040
if a two thirds majority votes
for that.

207
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,800
What is the case for putting this
president through that process ?

208
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,080
Constitution says grounds
for impeachment are treason,

209
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,520
bribery
or high crimes and misdemeanors.

210
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,800
That last phrase can trip
people up,

211
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,680
even people who might want
to research its exact definition.

212
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,560
There was no crime.
It's high crimes "and",

213
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,520
not "with" or "or",
it's high crimes and misdemeanors.

214
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,680
There was no high crime. And
there was no misdemeanor.

215
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,960
How do you impeach
based on that ?

216
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,560
Okay. Clearly "high crimes
and misdemeanors"

217
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:13,440
doesn't literally mean there has to
be both a big crime and a little crime.

218
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,520
The president's committed murder,
now we just need to catch him

219
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,320
urinating on the side of a Wawa,
and we've got him !

220
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,840
No, that's not
how anything works.

221
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,040
"High crimes and misdemeanors" can
include acts that are not crimes.

222
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,000
It is a broad term
for serious misconduct.

223
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,080
Congress is looking into a wide range
of Trump's potential misconduct,

224
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,120
from campaign finance violations

225
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,320
to whether or not he's used
his office to enrich himself.

226
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,960
One area where we have
evidence against Trump

227
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,160
is obstruction of justice,
a very serious allegation.

228
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,080
It was in the articles of impeachment
against both Nixon and Clinton.

229
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,200
Obstruction was also half
of Robert Mueller's report,

230
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,280
in which he laid out 10 potential
instances of it taking place.

231
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,240
We don't have time to get into all,
so let's just look at one,

232
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,880
involving Don McGahn, who was
Trump's White House Counsel.

233
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,040
You remember him as
the understudy for Brett Kavanaugh

234
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,040
during his confirmation hearing.

235
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,920
He was ready to go if Kavanaugh
ever cried himself into an early nap.

236
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,400
McGahn's appearance in the
Mueller Report got a lot of attention,

237
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,720
primarily because
of one eye-catching quote.

238
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,920
Former White House
Counsel Don McGahn refused

239
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
to ask Rod Rosenstein to fire Mueller
and threatened to resign

240
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,000
instead after the president
asked him to do, quote:

241
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,360
"Crazy..." using a word
that I can't use on TV.

242
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,600
The word is "shit".
The word in question is "shit".

243
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,000
Don McGahn said the president
and I quote:

244
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,040
"asked him to do crazy shit."

245
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,720
It's amazing that in a time
when norms are crumbling,

246
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,120
we are upholding the norm that
Ali Velshi can't say "shit" on MSNBC

247
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,680
though, I guess that does make
sense: kids love the Velsh.

248
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,520
There's nothing four year olds
love more than watching him on TV

249
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,920
and repeating everything
the Velsh says.

250
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,960
But that phrase "crazy shit"
became unhelpfully distracting.

251
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,920
The fact the president's lawyer
said a naughty word

252
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,040
kept people from focusing on the
details of what Trump asked him to do.

253
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,840
Which many argue amounted
to flagrant obstruction.

254
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,520
Trump asked McGahn
to have Robert Mueller,

255
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,920
the person investigating him,
fired.

256
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,960
According to McGahn, under oath,
Trump told him:

257
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,760
"Mueller has to go" adding,
"Call me back when you do it",

258
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,880
then calling him back,
and asking: "Have you done it ?"

259
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,400
This is something
important to Trump.

260
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,560
It wasn't something
said casually:

261
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,520
"Pattinson should not
take back Kristen Stewart."

262
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,280
"She cheated on him like a dog"
or "My favorite part of "Pulp Fiction"

263
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,520
is when Sam has his gun out
in the diner and he tells the guy

264
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,480
to tell his girlfriend to shut up.

265
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,240
Tell that bitch to be cool.
Say: "Bitch, be cool."

266
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,520
I love those lines.

267
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,760
This was something Trump
was serious about.

268
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,520
The potential obstruction
didn't stop there,

269
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,800
a second instance Mueller cited
came after news broke

270
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,840
that Trump tried
to remove Mueller

271
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,520
and Trump tried to get McGahn
to put out a statement denying it

272
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,720
and to write a letter
to that effect "for our records".

273
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,640
The president obstructed justice,
then obstructed justice again

274
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,680
to try to obstruct the investigation
into his obstruction of justice.

275
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,880
I know that this might seem
like a legal technicality

276
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:36,080
but here's why this really matters:
but for Don McGahn,

277
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,360
Trump might've stopped
an investigation into himself.

278
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,040
If a president can shut down
an investigation,

279
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,360
he can basically do
anything with no consequences.

280
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,440
It's a big, big deal.
The problem is,

281
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,640
this has been in the public record
for nearly two months.

282
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,920
Justin Amash, the only Republican
to come out in favor of impeachment,

283
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,960
held a town hall
where he explained his decision,

284
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,600
one of his attendees was shocked
to hear

285
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,040
that Trump might have done
anything wrong.

286
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,080
I was surprised to hear there
was anything negative

287
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,040
in the Mueller Report
at all about President Trump.

288
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,480
I hadn't heard that before.
I mainly listen to conservative news

289
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,000
and I hadn't heard
anything negative about that report

290
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,920
and Trump had been exonerated.

291
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,720
That's what'll happen when you mainly
listen to conservative news.

292
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,400
Like if your only source
of information about O.J. Simpson

293
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,920
is his new Twitter account,
that's real.

294
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,440
The Juice is on Twitter now. If that
was your only source of Juice news,

295
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,480
you might not understand why this
first video he posted is so alarming.

296
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,720
Now, coming soon to Twitter,
you'll get to read all my thoughts

297
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,840
on just about everything.

298
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,360
This should be a lot of fun.
I've got a little getting even to do.

299
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,640
What does "getting even"
mean for O.J. ?

300
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,160
When you kill two people you're even,
three people you're odd,

301
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,600
four people you're even again,
is that it ?

302
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:12,200
If that's the only place
you're getting your O.J. info,

303
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,440
your response to that video might
be: "O.J. looks great ! He's 71 !"

304
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,720
"Whatever he's been doing,
it works !"

305
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,960
But that woman
is by no means alone.

306
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,680
Most people are never going to read
a 448- page legal document.

307
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,160
That is why Congress has been
trying to have public hearings,

308
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,400
in a way that might resonate
with people better.

309
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,920
McGahn was called to publicly
testify last month,

310
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,600
which could've been very powerful,
that's why this happened instead.

311
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,120
Former Counsel Don McGahn
was a no-show at a House hearing,

312
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,840
the president insisted
he not testify.

313
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,720
Democrats had hoped to hear
from Don McGahn.

314
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,600
Instead, they were faced
with this empty chair.

315
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,080
Democrats tried to have a hearing,
but instead had Passover:

316
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,960
they put out a chair
for a guest who didn't arrive

317
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,680
and most of America
had no idea that it happened.

318
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,280
There is a real argument for
concentrating Congress's investigations

319
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,080
into one impeachment inquiry.

320
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,520
Why not do it ?
Nancy Pelosi might argue

321
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,240
that impeachment
is not popular with the public.

322
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,760
Polls show a majority of Americans
oppose impeachment proceedings.

323
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,440
Most people don't even know
what is in the Mueller Report.

324
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,840
And numbers can move as people
learn more. Look at Nixon.

325
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,720
In hindsight, his resignation
seems inevitable,

326
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,040
but in the early days, there was
public resistance to his removal.

327
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,960
Many more things are bothering
America than Watergate.

328
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,680
A big fuss over nothing.

329
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,600
Nothing has been proven illegal,
and I think he's on the right track.

330
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,480
Yeah, exactly. For a while,
people thought that Watergate,

331
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,520
the scandal that we now use as
shorthand for every political scandal,

332
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,400
didn't matter
and that's shocking to watch.

333
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,680
In the 1970s, they also thought
shag carpeting was attractive

334
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,560
and that Liberace
hadn't met the right girl yet.

335
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,800
That decade had a lot to learn.
A Nixon outcome is not the only model.

336
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,040
Many Democrats worry things could
end up like the Clinton impeachment,

337
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,960
where the public wasn't on board
with impeachment,

338
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,400
and they never got on board,
not only did Clinton survive,

339
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,360
his party gained seats in midterms.

340
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,400
That is what Democrats
are scared,

341
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,840
that impeachment could end up
strengthening Trump for 2020.

342
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,120
For Democrats whose
concern is that pursuing impeachment

343
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,680
could be the reason
they lose in 2020, relax:

344
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,760
it is just one of many ways
the Democrats could lose.

345
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,640
Maybe Trump is caught
on tape saying the n-word,

346
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,120
but then Elizabeth Warren accidentally
calls a "veteran" a "veterinarian"

347
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,560
and people get twice
as angry about that !

348
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,640
There's so many ways
that this could go wrong.

349
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,760
For so many people here,
the key calculation is,

350
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,080
would the benefits of
impeachment outweigh the risks ?

351
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,640
It's impossible to say how
a Trump impeachment would play out.

352
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,120
Although, him leaving office
is extremely unlikely.

353
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,000
That would require 20 Republican
senators to vote against him.

354
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,400
Even if they did that there is no
guarantee Trump would leave.

355
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,520
He basically told us as much
out loud.

356
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,880
When you look at past impeachments,
whether it was President Clinton,

357
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,880
or I guess President Nixon
never got there, he left.

358
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,120
I don't leave.
There's a difference.

359
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,160
Of course Trump wouldn't leave !
You think he'd hold a press conference

360
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,000
and bashfully say into a camera:
"I was wrong ?"

361
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,080
In what reality would that happen ?

362
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,960
Then he'd say: "I would now let
someone else be the president" ?

363
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,120
You're insane ! Then what ?
He'd pack a suitcase and walk,

364
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,920
physically walk out of the White House
and just not be the president ?

365
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,120
No ! He'd make us drag him out
like an uncooperative toddler.

366
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,560
You know that's true.
And if you're thinking:

367
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,560
"Well, if he's unlikely to go,
then what's the point ?"

368
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,320
It might be helpful to stop thinking
of this in purely binary terms.

369
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,640
If the president goes, that's
a success. If he stays, it's a failure.

370
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,360
Basically, it's Nixon or it's Clinton.
That's a false choice.

371
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,600
It's like saying you can only be
Hufflepuff or Slytherin.

372
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,360
Gryffindor and Ravenclaw
are right there !

373
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,520
And in my case,
"Snarglebargle":

374
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,160
that's the fifth Hogwarts house,
exclusively for cowards.

375
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,640
When it comes to impeachment,
there aren't just two outcomes.

376
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,000
Even if Trump is not removed,
which he probably won't be,

377
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,880
the process could shine a light on
the contents of the Mueller Report,

378
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,600
lead to new revelations
about Trump's conduct,

379
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,640
and force his Republican allies
to choose, publicly and on the record,

380
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,800
whether or not
to hold him to account.

381
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,400
You might say: "Even so, opening
an impeachment inquiry is risky."

382
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,280
I do get that. I've gone back and forth
on this myself, for that very reason.

383
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,360
The thing that's tipped the scales
for me is remembering

384
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,760
that not opening an inquiry
comes with consequences, too

385
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,720
'cause it sends the message that
the president can act with impunity.

386
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,680
Which is a dangerous precedent to set,
not just for future presidents,

387
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,160
but for the current one.

388
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,680
This week, he was asked about
Don Jr.'s failure to alert the FBI

389
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,600
when Russia offered them
intel during the campaign.

390
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,320
His response was appalling.

391
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,360
Should he have gone to the FBI
when he got that email ?

392
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,560
Let's put yourself in a position.
You're a congressman,

393
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,680
somebody says:
"I have information on your opponent."

394
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,920
- Do you call the FBI ?
- If it's coming from Russia, you do.

395
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,520
I don't think in my whole life
I've ever called the FBI.

396
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,280
You don't call the FBI.

397
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,120
This is somebody that said: "We
have information on your opponent."

398
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,320
Let me call the FBI.
Life doesn't work that way.

399
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,960
- The FBI director it should happen.
- The FBI director is wrong.

400
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,000
Okay. Let's break this down
into three pieces.

401
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,560
"I don't think in my life
I've ever called the FBI"

402
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,880
is a truly insane thing to say.

403
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,320
No, people don't call the FBI, except
when they're in a specific situation

404
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,720
that requires them to do so.

405
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:25,560
I have never called Emilio Estevez.
As a rule, in one's everyday life,

406
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,720
one does not call Emilio Estevez.

407
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:32,040
But, if I found a wallet on the street
with Emilio Estevez's drivers' license

408
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,800
and contact information,
I'd call Emilio Estevez,

409
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,480
because that's what
the situation requires.

410
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,960
Second, let's take his, "Give me
a break, life doesn't work that way."

411
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,440
It is fascinating to watch Trump
project his own immoral awfulness

412
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,040
onto the rest of humanity.

413
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,600
You see a baby stroller about
to roll down the hill, and what ?

414
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,240
You're gonna stop it ? Give me
a break, life doesn't work that way !

415
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,800
You stand there,
you watch and you laugh !

416
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,000
Everybody knows this
and everybody agrees.

417
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:11,040
Give me a break on that one.
And: "The FBI director is wrong."

418
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,280
He's basically saying:
"Laws are a matter of opinion,"

419
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,880
"and you can trust
your Uncle Don on this one."

420
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,640
That is not true. The head
of the Federal Election Commission

421
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,280
put out a statement reminding
all of us that:

422
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,160
"It is illegal to accept anything
of value from a foreign country"

423
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,240
"in connection with a U.S. election"

424
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,720
and "when foreign governments
influence American politics,"

425
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,320
"it is always to advance their
own interests."

426
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,560
She tweeted that out
with a note reading:

427
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,520
"I would not have thought
that I needed to say this."

428
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,920
And that kind of sums up where
we are in the Trump presidency:

429
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,440
all of those things we wouldn't
have thought we needed to say,

430
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,480
we need to say them now.

431
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,960
And as if that weren't bad enough,
Trump engaged in a thought experiment

432
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,640
of what he would do if he found
himself in the same situation again.

433
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,520
If someone else offers you
information on an opponent,

434
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,400
should they accept it,
or should they call the FBI ?

435
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,080
I think maybe you do both.
I think you might want to listen.

436
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:18,080
There's nothing wrong with listening.
If somebody called from a country,

437
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,520
Norway: "We have
information on your opponent."

438
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,520
I think I'd want to hear it.

439
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,480
You want that kind
of interference in our elections ?

440
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,600
They have information.
I'd take it.

441
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,360
Okay, first of all:
let's address that: "Norway".

442
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,800
It continues to be telling that
when Trump tries to search

443
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,240
for the best country he can imagine,

444
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,040
it goes directly to the whitest
country he can imagine.

445
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,520
But more importantly,
that is the president openly inviting

446
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,200
foreign interference
in our elections again.

447
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,520
I know that we've all become
numb to Trump by this point,

448
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,640
but moments like that really
shock you out of your stupor

449
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,200
and make you think:
"That guy's gotta be impeached."

450
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,000
"We've got to impeach him."

451
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:07,080
Should Democrats let investigations
play out further before a move ?

452
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,200
I don't know, maybe ! That strategy
paid off during Watergate.

453
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,440
But "later" can't mean "never".

454
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,480
The case for inaction here
is starting to get pretty weak.

455
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,080
And, yes, public opinion is
against an impeachment inquiry,

456
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:25,120
but if Democrats think opening
an inquiry is the right thing to do,

457
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,280
then it's then incumbent upon them
to work to change that opinion.

458
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,280
I know it's easy to be defeatist,

459
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,240
nothing has seemingly
reined Trump in so far.

460
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,640
But I will say this: every asshole
succeeds until finally they don't.

461
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,800
18 months before he resigned,

462
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,600
Nixon had a sky-high
approval rating of 67 percent.

463
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,040
Harvey Weinstein was winning
Oscars until one day, he wasn't.

464
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,640
James Holzhauer was stealing
all of Alex Trebek's money

465
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,880
until someone put a stop to it.

466
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,080
Respect the spirit of the game,
James, you fucking monster !

467
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:07,880
I can't guarantee that impeachment
will work out the way you want it to,

468
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,800
because it probably won't.

469
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,080
That doesn't mean that
it's not worth doing.

470
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,880
We'd be standing by the basic,
fundamental principle

471
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,720
that nobody is above the law.

472
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,480
And in doing so,
it would mean that,

473
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,320
when people tell dying relatives
that we're doing everything we can

474
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,920
to hold this president accountable,
this time, it would be true.

475
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,960
And now this.

476
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:38,760
Finally Tonight, A Father's Day Salute
To The Great Dads Of Local News.

477
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,200
- What do you want for Father's Day ?
- I want a day off.

478
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:46,240
- But you're not working on Sunday.
- No, from the family.

479
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,800
- What do you want for Father's Day ?
- I don't know.

480
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,480
- Then that's easy.
- Cold beer in a hammock.

481
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,080
Leave me alone for an hour,
let me sleep.

482
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,920
I'm happy with watching
the final round of the U.S. Open

483
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
on Sunday afternoon with
or without the family.

484
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,720
Let me have the house to myself.
