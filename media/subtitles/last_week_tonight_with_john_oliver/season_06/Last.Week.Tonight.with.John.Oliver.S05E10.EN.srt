00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,040
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,170
SEASON VI
EPISODE 10

3
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,020
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,100
A quick recap of the week.
We begin in Washington,

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,120
where Bill Barr failed to turn up
to a congressional hearing,

7
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,210
an act that prompted
this prop comedy.

8
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,180
Congressman Steve Cohen munched
on a bucket of fried chicken

9
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,200
and flaunted a ceramic chicken
to drive his point home.

10
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,120
What is the message
you're trying to send?

11
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,080
Bill Barr is a chicken.

12
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,410
Yeah, we get it.
You've made that painfully obvious.

13
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,470
It gets more pathetic, because
the hearing was at 9:30 A.M.

14
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,540
The nearest KFC didn't open until
10:30 and Cohen admitted

15
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,320
he bought the chicken the night
before and kept it in his fridge.

16
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:25,320
Which is just tragic.
He's biting into leftover KFC

17
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,500
or, as it's more commonly
known, trash.

18
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,420
That means this adult man
probably laid in bed all night

19
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,460
thinking about how awesome
his joke was going to be.

20
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,450
He was wrong about that.
The grandstanding nonsense didn't stop,

21
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,550
because Republican Thom Tillis
decided to go on the attack.

22
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:49,370
This guy didn't even have good enough
sense to have Bojangles' chicken.

23
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,350
They've got the chair and others
letting him have that kind of theater

24
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,510
in a House Committee room.

25
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,500
It's pathetic theater to eat KFC.
But not to rush to Kinko's

26
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,070
and laminate a poster image
of someone eating KFC.

27
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,100
I do realize we've just shown
a lot of KFC on our show,

28
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,220
which might encourage them
to send us some.

29
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,190
Please do not send us anything.

30
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,050
We do not want your weird
fried pigeon parts,

31
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,220
nor your bowls of whatever someone
shit out after they ate the pigeon.

32
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,200
Your items are not welcome.
Let's not focus on U.S. politics.

33
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,280
Let's turn to Australia, the country
that brought you Yellow Tail wine,

34
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,160
the party gift that says:

35
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:39,150
"Thanks for the invite, but your
friendship is not reciprocated."

36
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,040
Australia has a federal election
on May 18th

37
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,080
and their campaign
is less than a month old,

38
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,150
but there's already been a
ridiculous amount of scandals.

39
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,130
Steve Dickson, a leader in the far
right One Nation Party,

40
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,280
got in trouble when footage
surfaced of him at a U.S. strip club.

41
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,210
The secret video shows
the happily married politician

42
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,240
groping dancers and asking them
to come home with him.

43
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,850
It's a bad look and very
bad judgment from a man

44
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,970
who campaigns on family values.

45
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,950
I love the fact that she mentioned
that this was a bad look

46
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,050
because he campaigned
on family values,

47
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,910
as if the worst part of groping people
in a strip club

48
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,000
was that he wasn't behaving
"on brand".

49
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,930
Sure, he's a married man at
a strip club, groping the dancers,

50
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,850
but why wasn't his wife and children
with him in a sticky booth?

51
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,940
That would have made
all this fine.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,040
Sexual Harassment Dundee here
is by no means

53
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,860
the only spectacular implosion
of this campaign.

54
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,840
A shocking number of candidates
have got in trouble

55
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,060
over offensive social media posts:
this one for anti-Muslim posts,

56
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,030
for anti-Semitic posts,
for homophobic remarks,

57
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,060
this one for a rape joke,
and this one, Ross MacDonald,

58
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,980
for a plethora of lewd photos
he posted to his own Facebook,

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,030
including a photo of himself grabbing
a woman's breasts in a Thailand bar.

60
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,070
Which I'd say is the grossest
thing on his Facebook page,

61
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,940
were it not for a post labeled
"MMMM! Interesting thoughts"

62
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,870
attached to this photo of a woman
Photoshopped to look like a horse.

63
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,040
I do not think she should have been
disqualified from the Kentucky Derby.

64
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,020
You ran a good race, sexy naked horse
lady. On to the Preakness for you.

65
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,930
The most eye-catching candidate
is Clive Palmer,

66
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,060
head of his own
"United Australia Party".

67
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,060
A brash businessman with a populist,
anti-establishment platform.

68
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,850
If that's reminding you of someone,

69
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,080
wait till you hear him yelling
at a news anchor.

70
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,860
We've gotta stop about the fake news,
people attacking individuals.

71
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,960
My wealth's $4000 million,
do you think I give a stuff

72
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,990
about what you personally think
or anyone else?

73
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,930
I care about this country!

74
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,860
God bless Australia.
Put Australians first!

75
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,920
That's all pretty Trumpy.
Arrogance? Check.

76
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,850
Red tie? Check. He even has
billboards with his campaign slogan

77
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,010
"Make Australia Great".

78
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,560
Which notably doesn't say
"Make Australia Great Again".

79
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,660
Let's not rewrite history here.
We are, and have always been,

80
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,540
a big baking rock full
of huge spiders.

81
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,520
We're looking to go up from here.

82
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,580
Make Australia great
for the first time.

83
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,650
Palmer has positioned
himself as a political outsider,

84
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,600
despite the fact he was elected
before, in 2013,

85
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,620
and became a joke for being
the most absent politician

86
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,640
and for this moment, where
he either fell asleep in Parliament,

87
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,530
or realized he had to govern,

88
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,590
and so just played possum
until the next election cycle.

89
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,530
All you really need to know
about Clive Palmer

90
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,740
is two of his most
eye-catching business ideas:

91
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,640
his failed Jurassic Park-inspired
dinosaur park, "Palmersaurus".

92
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,560
And then there's this idea that
he's been working on for years.

93
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,570
The Titanic II will be
a ship of peace.

94
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,660
It will sail from China
to South Hampton,

95
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,620
from South Hampton to New York,
from New York to South Hampton.

96
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,140
By learning from the lessons of
the past, the spirit of Rose and Jack,

97
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,100
Romeo and Juliet
lives in all of us.

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,960
The spirit of life, the spirit of love,
to dream the impossible dream.

99
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,980
All of us live in time.
This is our moment,

100
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,930
it's our turn
to board Titanic II.

101
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,010
Titanic was the ship of dreams.

102
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,150
Titanic II is the ship
where dreams will come true.

103
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,150
That's an incredible idea,
coherently expressed. Pure gold.

104
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,160
Except, I do have a few notes.
First, the Titanic, as a boat brand,

105
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,110
is famous for two things:
being big and sinking.

106
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,020
We have cruise ships that are
five times the size the Titanic was,

107
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,060
so that just leaves
the sinking part.

108
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,110
I'm not sure how Titanic II constitutes
"learning the lessons of the past",

109
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:55,120
when one of those lessons is sitting
at the bottom of the North Atlantic.

110
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,980
Why is one of those lessons
"Jack and Rose",

111
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,040
not historical figures,
neither are "Romeo and Juliet",

112
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,110
which have as much
to do with the Titanic

113
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,940
as the Titanic has to do
with Australia?

114
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,210
Their spirits don't live in anyone.
Had they lived, they'd be dead,

115
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,060
along with everyone else
on the Titanic.

116
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,210
And fifth, the Titanic II.
That's your name?

117
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,160
The Titanic had
two identical sister ships

118
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,190
and do you know
what they were called?

119
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,200
Something a lot better than that!

120
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:29,110
Clive Palmer's Titanic II project
is representative

121
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,100
of his entire political
platform in this election.

122
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,040
He's unlikely to win many seats,
his pitch seems to be:

123
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,120
"Let's take a historic disaster
and for some reason, do it again,"

124
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,220
"only somehow dumber, worse,
and in Australia this time."

125
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,100
And now, this.

126
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:51,020
If You Live In Texas,
Lawyer Jim Adler

127
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,160
Would Like A Perfectly Normal
Word With You.

128
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:58,060
Greedy insurance companies
play dirty. Bring it on.

129
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,080
I'm Jim Adler.

130
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,240
Their lawyers will do their
tricky best to give you zero.

131
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,090
Unacceptable!
I'm Jim Adler, the Texas Hammer

132
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,430
and I do my best
to bring 'em down!

133
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:14,370
I get angrier than a junkyard dog!
I stand tough and carry a big hammer.

134
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,450
I growl and bark.

135
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,430
- Wake up!
- It's Hammer-time!

136
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,440
I'm Jim Adler,
the Texas Hammer.

137
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,470
And I'm Bill Adler,
the Texas Hammer!

138
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,380
Smash 'em with two hammers.

139
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,440
Double down.

140
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,520
Double the hammers,
double the justice.

141
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,430
I fight for your medical bills,
paychecks, pain and suffering.

142
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,500
- Jim Adler, Texas Hammer.
- Bill Adler, Texas Hammer.

143
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,520
- We stand tough.
- And carry a big, big hammer.

144
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,470
I thought so.

145
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:51,360
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns the desert rain frog.

146
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,420
If you think: "I don't
care about the desert rain frog",

147
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,410
maybe this
will change your mind.

148
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:02,380
This desert rain frog sounds
like a dog toy but actually,

149
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,540
this is the sonorous war cry
of a very angry frog.

150
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,250
How fucking great is that? That's
what it sounds like when it's mad!

151
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,290
How does it sound when it's
happy? What a frog!

152
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,220
Won't it be fun to learn
more about that tonight?

153
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,210
We're not gonna be able to do that,

154
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,270
because our actual main story
is about lethal injection.

155
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:31,240
That's right, only three more episodes
with the greatest lead-in

156
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,260
in modern television history and
I'm burning one on lethal injections.

157
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,090
It's a subject that doesn't
come up very much

158
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,130
because, frankly,
no one wants it to.

159
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,280
Lethal injections aren't something
people want to think about.

160
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,320
They happen frequently in America.

161
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,180
There was one in Georgia
three nights ago.

162
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:54,140
I know that there are differing
views on the death penalty.

163
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:58,170
Some believe it's a deterrent to crime.
Some believe it's justice.

164
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,190
And some, like Wyoming State
Senator Lynn Hutchings,

165
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,160
believe it's justified for
the weirdest reason.

166
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:10,180
The greatest man who ever lived
died via the death penalty

167
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,720
for you and for me.

168
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,480
I'm grateful to him for future
hope because of this.

169
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,510
If it wasn't for Jesus dying
via the death penalty,

170
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,580
we would all have no hope.

171
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,560
Your argument for the death penalty

172
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,630
is that it got us a Jesus once,
maybe one day,

173
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,550
if we kill enough people,
we'll get another one?

174
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,690
We'll get a bonus Jesus?
Let's keep rolling the dice,

175
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,710
Papa needs
a new pair of Jesuses.

176
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,570
My personal view on the death penalty
is different to that,

177
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,630
I don't think
it should exist.

178
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,700
There's no proof it has an effect
on bringing down crime,

179
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,690
it's more expensive to execute
than to keep them in prison for life,

180
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,640
and it's wrong.

181
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,510
It's a bad thing the government
should not be able to do.

182
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,720
Which makes my first two
points irrelevant there.

183
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Listing reasons
you don't support it

184
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,680
is like listing reasons
you'll not fuck your mom.

185
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,670
We don't have much chemistry,
she lives 300 miles away,

186
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,390
and, yeah, she's my mom.

187
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:21,360
I understand it can be hard
to sympathize

188
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,470
with people convicted
of heinous crimes.

189
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,450
According to one study,

190
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,260
4 percent of people sentenced
to death are innocent,

191
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,420
which in itself should give us pause
about the whole enterprise.

192
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,380
It's the equivalent of "it would make
things pretty weird with Dad."

193
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,480
Not the main reason not to do
it, and yet,

194
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,400
it should be disqualifying enough
on its own.

195
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,260
Let's say that you don't care
and you support the death penalty.

196
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,370
There's still the question
of how you do it.

197
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,360
Lethal injection came into vogue

198
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,350
because it was seen as a humane
and painless method.

199
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,430
It gained popularity
four decades ago,

200
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:00,470
as states started getting queasy about
the horrors of the electric chair.

201
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,270
One senator from Louisiana
explained his vote to switch

202
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,420
to lethal injection back then
pretty nicely.

203
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,270
I am for capital punishment,
but there is a more humane way.

204
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,440
I have seen evidence
in my committee this year.

205
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,040
I've seen photos of persons
that were electrocuted

206
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,200
and it is, I guess you would say,
kind of gross.

207
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,150
This is probably a step
in the right direction.

208
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,120
"Kind of gross?"

209
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,160
The electric chair set some
people's heads on fire,

210
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,040
so that's "kind of"
an understatement.

211
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,240
Putting mayonnaise on pizza
is kind of gross.

212
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,280
Otherwise cute dogs with large
erections are kind of gross.

213
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,240
Frying a human being until
their body's a smoking husk

214
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,130
is horrifying.

215
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,190
Lethal injection was sold
as something akin to surgery,

216
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:52,220
a medical procedure in which
a doctor helps a person go to sleep

217
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,200
and then
they just don't wake up.

218
00:12:54,230 --> 00:13:00,040
However much we want that
to be the case, it just isn't.

219
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,230
Let's start with the idea
it's medical.

220
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,270
That is more than
a bit of a stretch.

221
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,250
Injections aren't performed
by medical personnel,

222
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,180
for a pretty obvious reason.

223
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:14,230
In the US it violates ethical codes
for physicians to be involved.

224
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,940
So usually the people who are
involved in the executions

225
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,000
are not physicians, and they
are not properly trained

226
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,990
to do an IV insertion,
much less an execution.

227
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,010
Yeah, of course!
Anyone who's been properly trained

228
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,920
to perform a procedure
like a lethal injection

229
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,970
has also been trained
never to do that.

230
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,870
Hippocrates didn't say:

231
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,900
"First, do no harm.
Second do some harm."

232
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,010
The exclusion of medical personnel
extends to the design

233
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,810
of our lethal-injection process.

234
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,950
It wasn't developed
by scientists in a lab.

235
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,830
It came about when legislators
in Oklahoma tried to figure out

236
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,040
how to do it, and couldn't get
any doctors to work with them.

237
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,960
They turned to the state's
medical examiner Jay Chapman,

238
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,970
who warned them that:
"He was an expert in dead bodies"

239
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,860
"but not an expert in getting
them that way."

240
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,000
But he did helped them anyway!
So he wasn't an expert,

241
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,890
just an enthusiast with
a can-do attitude for killing people.

242
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:16,860
Lethal injection is being
administered by amateurs.

243
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:21,090
We're very much not under
the best of circumstances.

244
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,100
I'm afraid you're gonna have
to understand

245
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,140
some of the specifics
of how lethal injections work.

246
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,040
While the actual
protocol varies,

247
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,190
most administer
drugs in three steps:

248
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:36,060
first, they give an anesthetic
to put the inmate to sleep.

249
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:39,240
A paralytic to stop the limbs
from moving around.

250
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:43,250
There's no medical reason, it's for
the benefit of the people watching,

251
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:49,040
so that they won't see a body flail as
the 3rd drug initiates cardiac arrest.

252
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:54,260
The second and third drug
in this procedure are both,

253
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,210
in their own ways,
horrifying.

254
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,060
The third drug apparently feels like
"fire being poured into your veins."

255
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,200
And even the second drug,
for the benefit of onlookers,

256
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,280
is nightmarish, if you are
not completely knocked out.

257
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,220
If the inmate is not unconscious and
the inmate receives a second drug

258
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:17,110
that paralyzes the muscles,
that is a horrible situation

259
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,550
where you are awake but you can
not move, you cannot breathe.

260
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,320
So you have the sensation
of suffocating

261
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,350
and you can't communicate
to anybody.

262
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:33,410
You could be fully aware,
feel like you're suffocating,

263
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,420
but unable to move
or communicate,

264
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,390
while fire is about to be injected
into your veins.

265
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:42,510
This qualifies as more humane
than an electric chair.

266
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:48,490
It's like saying: "Which movie
has sexier CGI characters?"

267
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,500
"Zootopia" or "Monsters, Inc.?"

268
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,460
Probably "Monsters, Inc.,"
but it's not clear-cut,

269
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,540
and the question in and of itself
is disturbing.

270
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,340
If steps two
and three are torture,

271
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,490
the first drug becomes
critically important.

272
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,430
In theory, it's supposed to keep
you from feeling the other two.

273
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,420
We used to use a drug for this
called sodium thiopental.

274
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,560
But it stopped being made
here in 2011

275
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,420
and it's no longer approved
by the FDA for import.

276
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,720
Although some states have tried
to weasel around that restriction.

277
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,880
Five years ago, when Arizona
needed drugs to execute

278
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,810
an inmate named Jeffrey Landrigan,
it purchased them illegally

279
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,790
from a supplier operating out
of this driving school in London.

280
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,890
That is the most lethal thing
to come out of a British driving school

281
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,750
since Prince Phillip.

282
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:47,770
Even when that supply got cut off,
states didn't give up.

283
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,930
They looked for replacement drugs.
Texas tried buying them

284
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:54,940
from both a supplier in India
that also made illegal party pills,

285
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,820
and having them custom-made
by a small independent pharmacy

286
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,890
which also operated
as a gift shop.

287
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,830
Which is just perfect if you
want to pick up execution drugs,

288
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,770
but also give the inmate
a goodbye gift.

289
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,960
An oven mitt with googly eyes?
You shouldn't have, Barbara.

290
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,920
You really shouldn't have.
What is wrong with you?

291
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,890
Most states have given up
on sodium thiopental,

292
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,430
and instead they use
a drug called midazolam,

293
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,450
which is a sedative,
not a general anesthetic.

294
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,610
So it relaxes you, but doesn't
do anything to stop pain.

295
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,420
One expert has called it
a "martini in a syringe",

296
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,410
which sounds like A:
James bond's rock bottom,

297
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,630
and B: not nearly enough if
I'm about to feel suffocated

298
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,560
with fire in my veins.

299
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,530
When called upon in court to
justify using a sedative

300
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:55,420
during a procedure this painful,
states have relied exclusively

301
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,550
on this man:
Dr. Roswell Lee Evans.

302
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,470
He's testified as the key expert
witness in favor of midazolam

303
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:06,430
on behalf of six different states,
even though he's not a doctor.

304
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,620
He got his pharmacy doctorate
after 18 months of post-grad study,

305
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,460
before midazolam even existed

306
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,630
and has been working as a college
administrator since 1994.

307
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,470
And if you're thinking:
"How do you know

308
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:22,590
he's not been researching midazolam
since then?"

309
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:27,200
Watch this sequence of questions
he answered during a deposition.

310
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:32,190
Have you been involved in research
involving the use of midazolam?

311
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,250
No.

312
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,250
Have you been involved in research
involving the use of diazepam?

313
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,390
No.

314
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,340
Have you been involved in research
involving the use of lorazepam?

315
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,260
No.

316
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,360
Have you been involved in research
involving the use of propofol?

317
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,320
No.

318
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:56,390
Have you been involved in research
involving the use of pentobarbital?

319
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,390
No.

320
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,170
In research regarding
the use of sodium thiopental?

321
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,400
No.

322
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,180
Have you been involved in research
regarding the use of halothane gas?

323
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,380
No.

324
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,330
Have you been involved in research
regarding anesthetics of any sort?

325
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,370
No.

326
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:23,190
Two things are clear:
one, that guy is not an expert

327
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,420
on anything he's supposed
to be an expert on.

328
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:29,320
And two: there's a lot of overlap
between the names of sedatives

329
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,440
and the names of alien races
in selfpublished sci-fi novels.

330
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,320
I could imagine a book in which
Midazolam unite with Lorazepam

331
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,500
to fight the evil Halothane and
their minions the Pentobarbital.

332
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,450
I might not have to imagine that,
it's probably been optioned by HBO

333
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,330
in their upcoming
"Game of Space-Thrones."

334
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:51,330
In two weeks time,
this network is so deeply fucked.

335
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:58,490
It gets even worse: because
when this shaved Santa testified

336
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,330
in support of using midazolam

337
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,280
in a case that went before
the Supreme Court,

338
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,420
a full half of his 300-page expert
witness report consisted

339
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,470
of printouts from Drugs.com.

340
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:15,370
Drugs.com is a highly useful
resource for information.

341
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,360
Specifically, information
like this disclaimer:

342
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,450
"This is not intended for medical
advice, diagnosis or treatment."

343
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:28,450
No wonder that many inmates
do not want midazolam to be used.

344
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,510
In Arizona, some of them
sued over exactly this

345
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:35,430
and the Department of Corrections
hit on an ingenious solution,

346
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:39,520
saying that inmates could bring
their own execution drugs.

347
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:44,340
Which is pretty difficult,
with those drugs being restricted

348
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,470
and those prisoners
being in prison.

349
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:51,400
It's telling a one-year-old
to provide his own birthday cake.

350
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,470
How the fuck
am I supposed to do that?

351
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,390
I don't have the money.
I can't drive.

352
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,460
I can't even get out of this chair.
And I'm somehow supposed

353
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,320
to obtain my own fucking
Fudgie the Whale?

354
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:09,290
This is the worst birthday
I've ever had. Unbelievable!

355
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:15,340
When the head of Arizona's
Department of Corrections

356
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,350
was pressed on that plan,
he identified the problem.

357
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:22,490
You've never heard of a prisoner
on death row in Arizona

358
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:27,330
purchasing federally regulated drugs
for use in their own execution!

359
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,600
No.

360
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,600
Have you heard of any prisoner
ever doing that?

361
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,590
Not yet.

362
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:39,520
Not yet! No one in the history
of America has ever done this,

363
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,580
but I think our inmates
can pull it off!

364
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,500
It is sweet how much he believes in
the people he's putting to death.

365
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:51,660
I've held off on describing
specific cases to you.

366
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:56,570
But there are many examples
that show how terribly things can go

367
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,580
when all the factors you've
seen come together.

368
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:03,560
The list of botched executions
is long, and it is horrendous,

369
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,620
but let's take just one of them:
Clayton Lockett.

370
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,720
In 2014, Oklahoma made him

371
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,520
one of the first to be executed
using midazolam.

372
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,610
Right from the start,
things did not go as planned.

373
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,620
Executing Clayton Lockett with
a new three-drug combination

374
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,710
took 43 minutes.

375
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,700
A phlebotomist tried inserting
needles into Lockett's forearms,

376
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,690
neck, foot, groin and buttocks.

377
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:31,510
Minutes after the execution began,
Lockett's attorney, there as a witness,

378
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,630
says his client kept trying
to raise up and even said:

379
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,790
"Something's wrong."

380
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:40,840
They wanted to hurry up with
as little transparency as possible.

381
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,740
This is what they get.

382
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,830
Yeah, that attorney is right.

383
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,640
He's late for a gig as a Penn Jillette
impersonator, but he's right.

384
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,840
What happened in that room was
incredibly gruesome

385
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,720
and the investigation revealed
how ill-prepared

386
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,750
the people administering
the injection really were.

387
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:05,740
The drugs were not delivered into
his vein. They went into the tissue.

388
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,830
There were no backup drugs.
There was no emergency plan.

389
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,790
Regarding the use of midazolam,

390
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,790
Mike Oakley from the Corrections
Department said:

391
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:21,640
"I looked on-line. Went past the
key Wiki leaks or whatever it is,"

392
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,630
"and I did find out midazolam would
render a person unconscious."

393
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,620
"So we thought it was okay."

394
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:32,740
They looked up midazolam
on "Wiki leaks or whatever".

395
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,300
Which is just not ideal, is it?
To make sure that doesn't happen again,

396
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,160
we bought
"Wikileaksorwhatever.com",

397
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,210
which is now a large banner reading

398
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,400
"Midazolam Doesn't Keep You
From Feeling Pain."

399
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,200
"Please Stop Using It
In Executions."

400
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:53,190
We also added that frog.
Just to cut the tension a little bit.

401
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:56,210
If you click on him,
he squeaks! See?

402
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:01,310
He's angry about executions
as he well should be. What a frog!

403
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,240
Lethal injection actually has
the highest botch rate of any method.

404
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,340
Last year, two inmates
in Tennessee requested

405
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,210
and were executed by
the electric chair

406
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,180
because they believed
it would be less painful.

407
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,160
In our desire to find
a more humane method,

408
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:25,380
we've let amateurs invent and
administer an unpredictable torture.

409
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,330
Even ardent supporters of the death
penalty, like this federal judge,

410
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,390
will acknowledge that lethal injection
isn't what we'd like to think it is.

411
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,170
Use of lethal injection is a way
of lying to ourselves

412
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,090
to make it look like execution's
a peaceful, a benign,

413
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:49,130
sort of like going to sleep,
and they're not.

414
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,260
You have proposed alternatives.
You prefer firing squad.

415
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:59,090
- Never fails.
- But you also said the guillotine?

416
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,310
- That's right.
- Really? The guillotine?

417
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,130
It's 100 percent effective.

418
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:10,310
Sure, but...
First of all there:

419
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,320
I wish that Lesley Stahl had been
around during the French Revolution.

420
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,080
Really? The guillotine?
Come on.

421
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:21,180
Robespierre, look at me.
Look at your old friend Lesley.

422
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,260
Come on.

423
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:28,140
If hearing a federal
judge endorse the guillotine

424
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,320
makes you uncomfortable,
wait until you find out

425
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:34,130
he stepped down in the wake of
sexual misconduct claims.

426
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:37,080
Leaving me in the unenviable
position of saying:

427
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,270
that MeToo'ed judge who thinks
we should be cutting off more heads

428
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:43,100
makes some pretty
interesting points.

429
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,230
The hard truth here is:

430
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,200
there is no perfect way for
the government to kill people.

431
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,110
You're probably thinking
of alternatives.

432
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:55,150
What about assisted suicide? Can't
we do the same thing with executions?

433
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:58,250
It's harder to kill a healthy person
than someone near death.

434
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,120
Doctors and drug companies won't
be involved in executions.

435
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,210
What about overdosing
them on opioids?

436
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,250
We've tried that
and one execution took two hours,

437
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:11,190
with the inmate gulping
like a fish out of water.

438
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,290
What about cyanide?
We tried cyanide gas in 1992,

439
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,210
the attorney general vomited
and the prison warden claimed

440
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:21,120
he'd resign if forced
to conduct another one.

441
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:25,200
I could list methods all night long.
The latest idea is nitrogen gas,

442
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:29,190
which seems like it's got problems
of its own, but at the end of the day,

443
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:33,080
coming up with different ideas
to do this, is a bit like coming up

444
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,270
with positions in which you'd feel
least guilty fucking your mom.

445
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:40,250
Missionary? That's good for her
hips, but you're looking right at her.

446
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,800
Standing up? Mom hates
standing for any length of time.

447
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,790
Reverse cowmom?
That's probably your best bet,

448
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:50,840
but it's appalling and you shouldn't
be fucking doing it In the first place!

449
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,780
There's no way to do this
and make it okay!

450
00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:00,910
If the thing that's making you
comfortable with lethal injection

451
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,790
is that it's humane,
it isn't.

452
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,870
The fundamental fact to understand
is, it is a show.

453
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:11,920
It is designed not to minimize
the pain of people being executed,

454
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,950
but to maximize the comfort of those
who want to support the death penalty,

455
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:18,770
without confronting
the reality of it.

456
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:22,940
It's violent, brutal and will never be
anything other than that.

457
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,890
You might say: "I don't care what
happens to death row inmates."

458
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:27,990
"They're bad people."

459
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,990
Lethal injection isn't about who
they are. It's about who we are.

460
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:36,860
If, after everything you've heard,
you still think we should be

461
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,770
the kind of society that tortures
people to death in this manner,

462
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,930
we should be
like someone who looks at the list

463
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,930
of reasons not to fuck their mom
and does it anyway.

464
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:50,840
Which is a long way of me saying,
if we keep executing people

465
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:55,890
by lethal injections or any other
method, we are real motherfuckers.

466
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,830
And now this.

467
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,960
If You Think Jim Adler Didn't Also
Do His Ads In Spanish,

468
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,950
You Are Sorely Mistaken.

469
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,810
That's our show, thanks for watching.
See you next week. Good night.

470
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,020
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

471
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,970
END OF EPISODE 10,
SEASON VI
