00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,090
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,180
SEASON VI
EPISODE 6

3
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,140
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,020
I'm John Oliver,
thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,240
A quick recap of the week,
a busy one for the administration,

6
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,030
from Trump's attacks
on the Affordable Healthcare Act,

7
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,030
to his threats to close the southern
border, to Bernhardt's hearing.

8
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,220
He is Trump's pick for
Secretary of the Interior

9
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,160
and a former oil lobbyist,
so he's pretty swampy,

10
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:56,030
which some activists drew attention
to, as you'll see over his shoulder.

11
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,220
I have worked with many of you
and your staff.

12
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,210
I have met with many of you
in person, and by phone,

13
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,010
on various issues that were
of a concern to you

14
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,840
and I will always make myself
available to your requests.

15
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,920
Yeah! Nicely done. That woman
in the mask was there for a while.

16
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,910
Because ten minutes later?
Still there. 20 minutes? Still there!

17
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,060
45 minutes? Still there!
An hour later? Still there!

18
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,930
It is pretty funny, although,
I would not be doing my job

19
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,910
if I didn't point out
that this is a "swamp creature"

20
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,840
and technically what she's wearing
is a "lagoon creature" mask,

21
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,000
and that distinction
might not mean much to you

22
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,060
but in the aquatic goblin communities,
confusing the two is pretty racist.

23
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,080
This week was dominated by
the fallout from the Mueller Report.

24
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,960
William Barr submitted this
summary of its contents to Congress.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,010
The investigation did not establish
that members of the Trump campaign

26
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,030
conspired or coordinated
with Russian government

27
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,910
in its election
interference activities.

28
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,070
When it comes
to the question of obstruction,

29
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,970
Barr said Mueller did not have
enough evidence to prosecute

30
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,530
but could not
exonerate the president.

31
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,420
Report did not establish a conspiracy
between Russia and Trump's campaign,

32
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,370
which is undeniably
good news for the president.

33
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,580
The fact that Mueller did not exonerate
him on obstruction of justice

34
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,430
is pretty remarkable.

35
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,400
It might
prompt headlines like:

36
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,530
"President May Have
Obstructed Justice."

37
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,590
Which is why it's been weird
to see

38
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,550
the good news for the president
often shoving aside the bad.

39
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,560
The O.J. Simpson murders were
not reported as:

40
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,580
"Affordable House
Becomes Available In Brentwood."

41
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,430
There's something pretty big
missing from that headline.

42
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,520
All week, the president's supporters

43
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,460
took their one good news
and rounded it up to two.

44
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,580
No collusion.
No obstruction of justice.

45
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,550
No obstruction, no collusion.

46
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,440
No collusion,
no obstruction, nothing.

47
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,360
Victorious, exonerated,
vindicated.

48
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,420
Trump was not
completely exonerated.

49
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,470
The report literally used the words
"does not exonerate him."

50
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,800
Mueller could have been clearer
is if he put hand clap emojis

51
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,900
between every word.

52
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:15,000
Normally this is where we would
do a deep dive into the details,

53
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,810
explaining all the possible
implications.

54
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,940
The problem is...
We still haven't seen it.

55
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,040
Congress hasn't seen it.
Even the president hasn't seen it.

56
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,970
We know what Trump's own attorney
general thinks we need to know,

57
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,020
a man who, unsolicited
and before he got his current job,

58
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,030
sent top DOJ officials a memo ruling
out obstruction of justice charges

59
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,900
against the president.

60
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,950
There are plenty of qualifiers
and questions left here,

61
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,020
it's strange to see Trump's
supporters saying this.

62
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,840
One year, 10 months and six days.
$40 million of taxpayer money wasted.

63
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,940
It was all a waste.

64
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,040
How did we ever waste
two years of America on this?

65
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,940
All the Democrats yakking,
billions of hours of hot air

66
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,890
coming out of Democrat mouths.

67
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,800
All they got for it was this t-shirt.
They got nothing out of it.

68
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:07,890
If there's one authority figure I trust
on free shirts, it's gonna be that man.

69
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,200
There is no way actual U.S. currency
was exchanged for that outfit.

70
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,350
He's dressed like a personal-injury
attorney whose portrait

71
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,240
just got MeToo'ed off the wall
of an airport Palm steakhouse.

72
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,160
DOJ could well take in more
than it spent on the investigation

73
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,390
just in the form of asset forfeitures
from Paul Manafort alone.

74
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,330
As we've said before, even if
the investigation didn't conclude

75
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,320
Trump conspired with the Russians,
doesn't mean it was a waste of time.

76
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,340
It's easy to forget how much
we've already learned,

77
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,400
directly or indirectly, from
Mueller's investigation,

78
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,370
as so much has slowly
trickled out over two years.

79
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,280
Try and imagine
that it all came out at once,

80
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,210
and a single headline said:

81
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,190
"Russia Confirmed
To Have Interfered In Election"

82
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,280
"And President's Campaign Manager,
Multiple Advisers Convicted Of Crimes"

83
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,160
"And Trump And His Team Lied
About Business With Russia,"

84
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,280
"And Trump May Have Committed
Campaign Finance Violations"

85
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,240
"To Cover Up Affair With Adult Film
Star, After His Wife Gave Birth,"

86
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,490
"And Which He Also Attempted
To Continue, But Ended Up"

87
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,650
"Sitting Next To Her In A Hotel Room
And Watching "Shark Week.'"

88
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,490
All of that happened,
and we know it,

89
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,650
as a result
of Mueller's investigation.

90
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,720
This scandal has been sitting
in plain sight for so long,

91
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,640
we've stopped noticing it,

92
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,690
much like a woman in an
increasingly-sweaty fish mask.

93
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,560
The weirdest thing about this
situation is how somehow not-weird

94
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,550
this objectively ridiculous state
of affairs is starting to feel.

95
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,690
And now this.

96
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:45,500
In Honor of Opening Day:
A Reminder From L.A.'s Vin Scully

97
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,540
That Great Baseball Commentary
Doesn't Have To Be About Baseball.

98
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:53,690
Looking at Clayton Kershaw's
uniform with all the dirt on it,

99
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,550
it reminds us about the importance
of dirt to certain people.

100
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,570
Beards evolved number one,
because ladies like them.

101
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:08,640
It was the idea of frightening off
adversaries and wild animals.

102
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:15,210
There's a story that redheads will
be extinct by the year 2060.

103
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,330
There also seems to be a dispute
as to whether Betsy Ross

104
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,160
ever lived in Philadelphia's
popular Betsy Ross Home.

105
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,160
Just think about
how tough that rabbit was:

106
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,330
first it gets eaten by a snake,
the snake gets chopped to pieces,

107
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,350
then it gets picked up
by people and lives.

108
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,150
Line drive base hit to center
by Hendrik

109
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,160
and the Dodgers
are in business.

110
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,150
First and second
and nobody out.

111
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:50,170
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns professional wrestling.

112
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,120
Literally the only good excuse
to wear a onesie.

113
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,160
Babies,
you're not pulling it off.

114
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,230
Put on some jeans and a button
down, like a fucking person.

115
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,210
I want to talk about the undisputed
corporate champion of wrestling,

116
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:07,270
the WWE, formerly known
as the WWF until, and this is true,

117
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:10,230
they lost a court case to
the World Wildlife Fund,

118
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,760
presumably thanks to that fund's
powerful team of panda lawyers.

119
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,580
Before we go any further,
let me say this: I like wrestling.

120
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,620
You might be surprised to hear that,
but it's objectively entertaining.

121
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,760
The WWE has, over the years,
delivered numerous, ludicrous

122
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,790
and genuinely incredible moments,

123
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,570
from when Jake "The Snake" Roberts
set a live cobra on "Macho Man",

124
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,760
to the time Strowman suplexed
the Big Show off the turnbuckle,

125
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,700
to when "Stone Cold" Steve Austin
drove a beer truck into the arena

126
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,610
and sprayed the corporation
with a beer hose,

127
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,710
not to be mistaken with the time
Kurt Angle drove a milk truck

128
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,740
and sprayed "Stone Cold"
Steve Austin with a milk hose.

129
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,700
And whatever the fuck this is.

130
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,700
My God, here we go!

131
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,750
What's gonna happen?
Look out!

132
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,700
My God!

133
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,670
Everything about that
is fantastic.

134
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,640
My favorite part is after
the table was lit on fire,

135
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,100
the commentator asking:
"What's gonna happen?"

136
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,020
What was he expecting to happen?
The table's on fire!

137
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:22,010
Here comes a hibachi chef, and
he's making those onion volcanoes!

138
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,880
Now he's doing
indoor s'mores! Oh my God!

139
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,110
It is worth talking about the WWE
tonight, for multiple reasons.

140
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,900
First,
it's astonishingly popular.

141
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,000
It has over a billion
fans on social media,

142
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,930
it has two highly-rated cable shows,
its own streaming network,

143
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,010
reality shows, video games
and even a movie studio,

144
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,920
which has produced hits as
"The Scorpion King", "Walking Tall",

145
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,020
"The Marine", "The Marine 2",
"The Marine 3", "The Marine 4",

146
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,120
"The Marine 5", "The Marine 6",
and, of course, "Lincoln".

147
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,960
By the way, their first choice
to play Abraham Lincoln

148
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,060
was Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake,
but he wasn't available,

149
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,880
so the role went to Daniel Day-Lewis,
who was, he was fine.

150
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,970
This company makes
a lot of money.

151
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,920
Last year, it generated
a record $930 million in revenue.

152
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,150
WrestleMania alone,
which is taking place next Sunday,

153
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,190
is one of the most valuable
sports brands in the world,

154
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:21,150
ranking higher than the World
Series, which actually makes sense,

155
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,070
'cause while the World Series
is mostly spent

156
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,160
watching a millionaire
think about whether to throw a ball,

157
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,110
WrestleMania
involves things like this.

158
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,160
No, oh my God.

159
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:38,060
For the love of mankind. Shane
just exploded through our table.

160
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,140
Are you not entertained?

161
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:47,100
How could any other TV show top that?
I would argue every other show

162
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,050
should be called "Not A Guy
Exploding Through A Table."

163
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,160
And this show should be
very much included in that.

164
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:58,100
The other reason that it's worth
talking about the WWE

165
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,190
is the prevalence
of stories like these.

166
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,040
Eddie Guerrero, found dead
in a Minneapolis hotel room.

167
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,210
The World Wrestling star
was just 38 years old.

168
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,240
We have just confirmed that
Randy "Macho Man" Savage has died.

169
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,940
Chyna, one of the most famous
wrestlers in the 90's has now died.

170
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,880
She was 46 years old.

171
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,910
Pro wrestling legend "King Kong"
Bundy has died at the age of 61.

172
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,930
He came here,
we were in Studio A.

173
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,990
And he lifted me almost
to the ceiling.

174
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,940
Just 61 years old,
these wrestlers dying early.

175
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,080
That is a harrowing statement
from Brian Kilmeade,

176
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,030
slightly dampened by his wonder
at how high the big man lifted him.

177
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,080
Did Bundy offer him?
Did Kilmeade ask?

178
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,040
I wouldn't be surprised if one
of his stock interview questions is:

179
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,930
"Up! Up! Horsey ride!"

180
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,040
Kilmeade is not wrong there.

181
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,890
Wrestlers dying early
is a troubling trend.

182
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,070
FiveThirtyEight tracked the rate
of deaths among WWF wrestlers

183
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,990
and findings were startling.

184
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,890
Here is the expected death rate
among the population as a whole.

185
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,080
Here is the rate among former NFL
players. And here, among wrestlers.

186
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,980
That is shockingly high! You'd
expect that line to be labeled:

187
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,050
"Test Pilots
Who Lied On Their Resume"

188
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,050
or "Zookeepers Who Aren't Gonna
Let Some Baboon Screech At Them."

189
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,920
Enough sass-mouth, buddy!
Put some respect on my name!

190
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,920
With that in mind, tonight,
a week ahead of WrestleMania,

191
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,800
let's take a look
at how the WWE does business

192
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,780
and how it treats its wrestlers.

193
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,840
You can't talk about the WWE without
talking about its chairman and CEO,

194
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,770
Vince McMahon, because he is
incredibly powerful, as you can see

195
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,790
in this actual photo he took
for a fitness magazine:

196
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,680
"Scary Grandpa Who Looks Like
A Big, Bumpy Hot Dog Quarterly."

197
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,790
Vince bought the company
from his dad

198
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,730
and has overseen its
ascent into the mainstream.

199
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,880
Before he came along, wrestling was
splintered into fiefdoms,

200
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,680
all of which
had their own broadcasts.

201
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,730
Welcome to the special edition of
World-Class Championship Wrestling.

202
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,770
Welcome to
Mid South Wrestling.

203
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,700
Mid-Atlantic Wrestling.

204
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,870
Welcome
to the Universal Wrestling Federation.

205
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:13,830
I get wrestling is all about spectacle
and pageantry but a tuxedo, Jim?

206
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,880
Tone it down a notch,
you're not at a fucking gala.

207
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,700
Michael, as usual, no notes,
you look great, keep living your truth.

208
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,590
Throughout the '80s and '90s,

209
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,620
Vince McMahon eliminated or absorbed
his competitors

210
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,600
and now one giant company
holds a monopoly on the industry.

211
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,490
It's impossible to overstate
just how involved Vince is.

212
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,500
He's not just CEO. He oversees
storylines, scripts,

213
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,680
playing a fictionalized
version of himself,

214
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,490
as the show's overarching villain,
his choices of how to dramatize

215
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,720
have been pretty questionable,

216
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,710
whether it's him forcing female
wrestlers to strip

217
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,550
or beating up his supposed
illegitimate son, Hornswoggle,

218
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,690
or dropping the ultimate racial
slur as part of a comedic skit.

219
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,490
Sup, boss?
How you doing?

220
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,490
- What's good in the 'hood?
- Trying to take care of business.

221
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,580
Keep it up, my nigga.

222
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,630
That is rough to watch.
And remember:

223
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,510
he's in complete control
of those scripts.

224
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,670
No one is making him do that.
While he is playing a villain there,

225
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,840
there are other ways
that that can be achieved.

226
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,760
Darth Vader was a great villain,
not once did he drop the n-word.

227
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,790
R-2 said it pretty much nonstop,
it's why he kept getting bleeped.

228
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,690
The fact that McMahon is an
active character in wrestling

229
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:42,720
gives us an opportunity, he's taken a
lot of in-ring abuse over the years.

230
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,830
At points where
you're gonna be disgusted,

231
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,780
for say, using the n-word,
I can now simply play a clip like this,

232
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,690
of The Rock smashing him
with a trashcan lid.

233
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,610
I grabbed this!

234
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,660
Wrestling's good.
It's just very good.

235
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:04,750
While the character is an asshole,
the real Vince is also an asshole.

236
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:10,810
Many fans hate him because while
the WWE has made him a billionaire,

237
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,750
many wrestlers
say he's treated them terribly.

238
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,820
Listen to Bret "Hitman" Hart,
one of the biggest wrestlers

239
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,680
speaking about his former boss.

240
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,800
Vince McMahon has always treated
wrestlers like circus animals.

241
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,710
All these wrestlers that have
broke their backs for years

242
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,610
end up with nothing when it's over,
they sort of take you out back

243
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,730
and dump you out, and that's
the life of a professional wrestler.

244
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,800
That may sound extreme.
But Hart has good reason to be angry.

245
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,770
His own brother, Owen,
died wrestling for Vince.

246
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,620
Hart is far from alone in voicing
grievances about his former employer.

247
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,760
The shocking thing is the extent
to which he's shielded himself

248
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,680
from responsibility
for wrestlers' welfare.

249
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,710
The main way
he's done this is simple,

250
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,670
while you might reasonably think
that the wrestlers employed by him

251
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,720
are his employees,
they're actually not.

252
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,610
They're merely
independent contractors.

253
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:11,680
Which as former wrestler Jesse Ventura
pointed out on Howard Stern, is insane.

254
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:15,750
How are they self-employed
when you're signed exclusively...

255
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,760
- You can't work for nobody else.
- It's a monopoly.

256
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,340
They tell you when and where you'll
work. They tell you who you'll work.

257
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,270
- They control your life.
- And you're an independent contractor.

258
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,480
And yet, they call you
an independent contractor.

259
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:35,300
How has the government allowed them
to get away with that for 40 years?

260
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,250
Yeah, he's got a point.
An independent contractor

261
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:42,450
is someone that you might hire
for a specific, limited task,

262
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,440
like a plumber, or an accountant.

263
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,340
Wrestlers aren't either,

264
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,290
apart from this wrestling plumber
and this wrestling accountant.

265
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,420
The vast majority
are totally different.

266
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,470
And as independent contractors,
wrestlers are exempt

267
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,280
from most discrimination
and occupational safety laws.

268
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,470
They don't get paid annual leave,
pensions, or health insurance.

269
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,460
When you look at the
Department of Labor and the IRS's

270
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,350
criteria for independent
contractors, it's a complete joke

271
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,270
to think that they apply
to Vince's wrestlers.

272
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:15,480
The IRS states that independent
contractors should be free to work

273
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,440
when and for whom
they choose.

274
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,450
Vince's wrestlers sign exclusive
contracts, so that's bullshit.

275
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:25,280
Guidelines say someone's
probably not an independent contractor

276
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,280
if the success or continuation
of a business

277
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,080
depends to a degree
on the services they provide.

278
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:36,280
Are wrestlers essential
to World Wrestling Entertainment?

279
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:41,080
It's not called "World Totally
Empty Ring Entertainment."

280
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,260
So there that might be clue.

281
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,110
If I might quote
the company's own website:

282
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,120
"WWE performers are
the company's greatest asset,"

283
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,090
"without our performers,
WWE would not exist."

284
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:56,260
When wrestlers might work years ago
for different organizations,

285
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,100
it made sense
to call them contractors.

286
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,300
But now that WWE has
a chokehold on this industry,

287
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,270
it makes as much sense to call them
that as it does to call Jimmy Carter

288
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,280
a "panty-dropping fuck machine."

289
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,310
It's just clearly not true...
anymore.

290
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:19,110
For what it's worth, back in 1986,
Ventura tried to unionize wrestlers

291
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,250
which could've improved
their working conditions,

292
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,870
but McMahon stamped it out hard.

293
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,920
If that makes you want to see
someone stamp him out hard,

294
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,820
I have some good news.

295
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,930
Sweet chin music.

296
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,930
Shawn, the sweet chin
music to Mr. McMahon.

297
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,930
Shawn has knocked out the owner
of the World Wrestling Federation!

298
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,950
Wrestling is better
than the things you like.

299
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:49,840
The lack of a union to advocate
for wrestlers

300
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,960
means that Vince
gets to call all the shots.

301
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,980
While every sports league has
an off-season for athletes to recover,

302
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,810
the WWE works its wrestlers
year-round, multiple times a week,

303
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,780
both on TV and in untelevised
so-called "house shows".

304
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,800
And big stars may be able
to command big money for that,

305
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,930
but not every wrestler
is a big star.

306
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:13,800
Whenever we've gotten glimpses
of wrestlers' contracts,

307
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,830
they contain
astonishing clauses.

308
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,810
If a wrestler is unable to wrestle
for six weeks because of an injury,

309
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,930
the company
can terminate their contract.

310
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,910
Another releases the company
from all liability for damage resulting

311
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,590
in permanent injury or death,
even if caused by its own negligence.

312
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,520
Which is a crazy thing for McMahon
to put in a contract.

313
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:38,360
Enough to make you want to see him
be on his own medical mishap.

314
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,400
How about your foot?

315
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,410
You like that?
What do you think about that?

316
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,590
Say what you like about that,

317
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,550
still technically more helpful
than a visit from Dr. Oz.

318
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,530
When you take this together

319
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,460
with wrestlers
as independent contractors,

320
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,550
in a monopolized industry,
free from meaningful oversight

321
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,500
and able to be fired at any time,

322
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,450
you wind up with an environment
with potential for unsafe conduct.

323
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:09,430
Before Lance McNaught died
at 29 of heart failure,

324
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,390
while struggling with addiction
to painkillers,

325
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,430
he spoke of the pressure
that he felt:

326
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:18,440
"If you get hurt, you work through it,
cause you'll lose your spot."

327
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,490
Another top wrestler, CM Punk,
has questioned the advice

328
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,530
given by a WWE doctor
following an incident in the ring.

329
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,420
I got hit with something
and I got a concussion.

330
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,690
But we were leaving for Europe the next
day, so Doc was leaning on me going:

331
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:37,750
"Do you have a concussion
or can you go to Europe?"

332
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,660
I was like: "You pigs,
I'll go to Europe. Whatever."

333
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,610
That's on me, that's my fault.
I'm dry-heaving after every match.

334
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,720
I'm either puking for real
or I'm just dry heaving.

335
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,600
Doc's like:
"You're sick, here's a Z-Pak."

336
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:56,780
They Z-Pak me to death,
I shit my pants on a SmackDown.

337
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,600
He did! He actually did that
and we found that episode

338
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,720
and out of common courtesy,
we are not going to show it to you.

339
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,710
But, this is his face
as it was happening.

340
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,750
Punk even tweeted about it:

341
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,630
"Just shit my britches on Smackdown.
Please retweet."

342
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,600
Something the WWE then
made him take down,

343
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,760
even though it's the best
tweet ever written.

344
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,740
Try and think of a better tweet!
Have you got one?

345
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,730
Does it say: "Shit my britches,
please retweet?"

346
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,620
Then it's not better, is it?
Stand down.

347
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:36,890
It gets much worse than concussed
wrestlers shitting themselves,

348
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,890
because wrestlers' bodies
regularly get smashed up

349
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:44,800
and undergo general wear and tear,
damage that's cumulative.

350
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,700
McMahon doesn't provide
health insurance

351
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,860
for anything other than injuries
that occur inside the ring.

352
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,910
The extent to which he's denied

353
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,700
any responsibility
for their welfare is astonishing.

354
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,730
Watch him respond to a question
about wrestler deaths.

355
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,780
A reason why these people
would be dying under the age of 45?

356
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,920
Why don't you ask
yourself that question?

357
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:10,720
Are you indicating that's
my responsibility?

358
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,700
I'm asking you if it's in any way
falls on your shoulders?

359
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:20,690
I would accept no responsibility
whatsoever for their untimely deaths.

360
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,720
You've got that little look like:
"How can you possibly say that?"

361
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:29,840
But none whatsoever?
They were part of your organization.

362
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,840
They worked a couple
of hundred nights a year for you.

363
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,540
Oh my God!

364
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:40,430
What are you doing,
you weird, weird man?

365
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,470
While all of that is ridiculous,
my favorite response

366
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,440
isn't the weird face or
the smacking of the papers.

367
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,480
It's: "Why are wrestlers dying early?"
with "Why don't you ask yourself?"

368
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,560
In terms of dodges,
is certifiably insane.

369
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,360
Maybe because
that journalist doesn't employ

370
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,530
any wrestlers and while I know that
you don't think you do either,

371
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,530
you're fucking
wrong about that.

372
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,490
The company will say that they've
transformed in recent years.

373
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:11,460
They have taken positive steps,
like banning chair shots to the head

374
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,540
and introducing
concussion protocols.

375
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,330
CM Punk's experience suggests there
may be room for improvement.

376
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,410
Some of the other steps they've taken
under their "Talent Wellness Program"

377
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:26,520
are underwhelming, like the fact they
now have annual physical examinations.

378
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,370
That's nothing. I have to take
one of those every year

379
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:34,380
to host this show and I've never
once exploded through this table.

380
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,720
It's in the name
of our show, now.

381
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,750
The program also provides for things
like cardiovascular and brain testing,

382
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:45,740
although they're still responsible
for their health insurance.

383
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,590
Company pays for addiction
treatment for former wrestlers,

384
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:53,740
that doesn't address the issues that
get them hooked on pain medication.

385
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:59,570
Some have had to drag their
bodies back to the WWE,

386
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,750
because they have
no other financial option.

387
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:05,650
"Rowdy" Roddy Piper continued
wrestling into his 40's and 50's

388
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,600
and listen to him explain why.

389
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,740
Wrestling has
a tremendous entrance plan.

390
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,790
You come in
as "Boy, here you are."

391
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,580
Everything's wonderful,
it's got no exit plan.

392
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,770
"Rowdy" Roddy Piper should know.

393
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,630
A few months ago,
he climbed back into the ring.

394
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,600
What would you have me do at 49

395
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,750
my pension plan, I can't
take out till I'm 65.

396
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,650
I'm not gonna make 65,
let's just face facts, guys.

397
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,160
Sadly, he was right about that.

398
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,080
Roddy Piper died in 2015
at the age of 61.

399
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,100
While nothing I say can or should
make that okay,

400
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,040
I hope that watching
this clip of Vince in the ring

401
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,930
gives you just
a tiny piece of catharsis.

402
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,020
He's a billionaire.
He owns this company.

403
00:23:54,930 --> 00:24:00,110
Lucifer's lips on the biggest
ass in the WWF. Hell yeah!

404
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,070
The reassuring thing there is,
you can fake being kicked in the face

405
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:09,020
or hit in the head with a bedpan,
but there is no faking that.

406
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,990
So, I guess the question is,
is there any hope here?

407
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:19,040
Incredibly, there might be.
There is one group that even McMahon

408
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,050
occasionally seems to listen to
and that's the fans.

409
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,010
They have a strong,
independent voice in the WWE.

410
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,040
And have been vocal over the years,
from the dealings with Saudi Arabia,

411
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,160
to its treatment of female wrestlers,
who have come a long way

412
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,950
from the old days of so-called
"Bra and Panty" matches.

413
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,160
Fans online launched a hashtag
#GiveDivasAChance campaign

414
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:43,050
to feature women more
prominently, to which Vince responded:

415
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,240
"We hear you. Keep watching."
Next week, for the first time ever,

416
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:49,270
WrestleMania will be headlined
by a women's match.

417
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,080
Wrestling fans don't just go along

418
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,110
with whatever the company
tells them to cheer and boo.

419
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:58,190
They know what they like
and what they don't like.

420
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:04,170
The WWE tried for years to make
Roman Reigns a Superstar hero

421
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,050
on the level of The Rock.

422
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,270
But fans just didn't like him

423
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,280
and they let him
and the WWE know about that.

424
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,220
And keep in mind, Roman Reigns
is supposed to be a good guy.

425
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:19,050
Fuck you, Roman!

426
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,210
Asshole!

427
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,230
Roman sucks!

428
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,270
Go away!

429
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,060
They booed him nonstop
for eight minutes!

430
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:48,090
Might think that's harsh,
but it's the rational response

431
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,160
to someone with
permanently wet hair.

432
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:55,010
How can it always be wet? You look
like a pedophile out for a jog.

433
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:03,100
The fans have a big voice here.
They care about these wrestlers

434
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,100
and continue to do that long after
the WWE has abandoned them.

435
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,100
Nowhere was the extent
of this devotion more obvious

436
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,060
than when Jake "The Snake" needed
help paying for medical expenses.

437
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:18,130
Jake has no insurance, he didn't have
money to pay for the surgery.

438
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,150
We had to come up
with a solution.

439
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:26,160
We put up a page on Indiegogo
to try to raise the money.

440
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,050
Unfucking real.

441
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,140
- Where we at?
- Holy cow.

442
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,970
7,000.

443
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,100
In one night?

444
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,100
But the really cool thing
that came out of that

445
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,570
is Jake got to see
how much the fans really cared.

446
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,730
All those years, I guess
they did mean something.

447
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,690
Yeah, those years
meant a lot to fans.

448
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:52,520
That's why they want him and others
to be taken care of.

449
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,760
There've been multiple GoFundMe
campaigns to cover both health care

450
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:59,690
and funeral expenses for wrestlers
that fans have stepped up for.

451
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:04,560
Fans shouldn't be the ones
shouldering that responsibility.

452
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:09,570
Even the NFL,
for all its massive faults,

453
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,610
now offers players health reimbursement
accounts and have established

454
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:17,620
a "Legacy Fund" for older players
who may be dealing with health issues.

455
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,710
When you've lost the moral high
ground to the fucking NFL,

456
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,550
you are
morally subterranean.

457
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,620
Here is where the potential
opportunity is,

458
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:34,540
WrestleMania, the biggest event
in the WWE's calendar, is next Sunday.

459
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,760
And if fans in that arena want
McMahon to help pay

460
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,760
for wrestlers' long-term health care
or just to call them employees,

461
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,690
they could choose
to make up chants about that.

462
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:47,690
The event is live, they won't be
able to cut the chants out.

463
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,640
I'm not saying that fans should
do that. Or make lots of signs.

464
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:55,580
I really hope they make their
voices heard on this,

465
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,710
because given that
Business Hulk here is a billionaire

466
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,580
on the broken backs
of his non-employees,

467
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:05,510
the very least he can do is show
the same dedication to wrestlers

468
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,710
they have shown to his company.

469
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,700
I haven't really said any of this

470
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,590
in the preferred language
of wrestling fans.

471
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,500
So, maybe this will help.

472
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,580
Wrestling fans!
You cheered at Royal Rumble.

473
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,660
You thrilled at Hell in a Cell.
You yelled at SummerSlam.

474
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,540
Get ready to scream
for something new.

475
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:28,530
I'm talking about all wrestlers having
access to retirement accounts,

476
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,570
workers comp
and family and medical leave.

477
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:35,590
How would you feel about watching
the most electrifying superstars

478
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,540
do the unthinkable,
the "F" to the agents,

479
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,510
65, 70, 75 and beyond!

480
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:47,780
Performing thrilling moves
like walking comfortably,

481
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,770
bending their knees
past a 90-degree angle

482
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,780
and spending quality time
with their grandchildren!

483
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:58,730
You could see all this
if a system was put in place

484
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,670
that gave wrestlers
things like an off-season,

485
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:05,660
the human body was not designed to do
things like this 200 nights a year.

486
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:11,840
We're talking about bringing premature
wrestler deaths back in line.

487
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,710
Did somebody say tables?
He's gonna need a doctor,

488
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:21,650
and preferably one who won't
make him shit his pants on SmackDown.

489
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:24,750

to be employees
so you never have to pay

for their future surgeries
through GoFundMe?

If Mr. McMahon doesn't like it,
you know what he can do.
