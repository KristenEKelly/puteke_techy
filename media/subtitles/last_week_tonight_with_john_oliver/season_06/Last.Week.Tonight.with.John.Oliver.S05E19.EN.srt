00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,680
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,320
SEASON VI
EPISODE 19

3
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,160
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,840
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,080
A quick recap of the week.
We begin with the United Kingdom,

6
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,000
a country that,
and this is true, had a good run.

7
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,080
We're gonna begin with the UK's
new prime minister, Boris Johnson,

8
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,160
a man whose photo should accompany
the headline "Owen Wilson Drowns."

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,400
Johnson's tenure as prime minister
began with a tour around the UK,

10
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,720
where he was received with
the level of warmth he deserves.

11
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,840
Prime Minister Boris Johnson
has kicked off his first full week

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,240
as prime minister
with a trip to Scotland,

13
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,040
where he's calling for a strengthening
of the ties that bind the UK.

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,000
That's some booing there.

15
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,560
Yeah, it was. That was, indeed,
some booing there.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,240
Seems like the current
"ties that bind the United Kingdom"

17
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,520
consist of "shared abject hatred
of one particular man."

18
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,320
The booing wasn't the low point
of Boris's week.

19
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,920
A special election
for a parliamentary seat

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,440
did not go well for him.

21
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,360
Boris Johnson's chances
of securing any agreement on Brexit

22
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,880
just got harder.

23
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,200
The Pro-EU Liberal Democrats
picked up a parliamentary seat.

24
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,120
This leaves Mr. Johnson with
a majority in the House of Commons

25
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,200
of just one seat.

26
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,400
Boris has been in the job
for just over a week

27
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,320
and his majority
is down to one.

28
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,640
The already impossible task
of getting parliamentary approval

29
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,640
on a workable Brexit deal
just got even harder.

30
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,400
It's like if Apollo 11
was about to land on the moon

31
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,720
and Aldrin turned to Armstrong
and said:

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,240
"Don't be mad, but I just
realized I forgot our space suits !"

33
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,160
"How long can you hold
your breath ?"

34
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,440
In the midst of all this,
Boris met with Britain's farmers,

35
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,880
who could be hit hard
by a no-deal Brexit.

36
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,200
Which led to this image of him
tightly grasping a chicken.

37
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,440
That chicken's face may sum up
the feelings of many in Britain.

38
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,440
Look at it. "It seems I'm firmly
in the clutches of an idiot"

39
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,200
"who appears to have no idea
what to do with me."

40
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,720
"I may as well just go limp,
wait for my dark fate to come to pass"

41
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,880
"and pray
this is all over quickly."

42
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,440
Let's move on to John Ratcliffe,
Trump's short-lived pick

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,040
for Director of National Intelligence
and third season winner

44
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,800
of the reality show
"So You Think You Can Romney !"

45
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,440
The president announced Ratcliffe
as his pick for DNI on Twitter

46
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,880
and he seemed
an odd choice.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,240
It's a job overseeing 17 agencies with
a combined budget of $60 billion

48
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,240
and anyone nominated is required
by law to have

49
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,960
"extensive national
security expertise."

50
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,280
Which is something Ratcliffe
emphatically did not have.

51
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,680
He was the former mayor
of Heath, Texas,

52
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,600
an unpaid position in a town
of around 9 000 people.

53
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,080
If you want to get an idea
of the issues he had to deal with,

54
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,520
let me point you
to Heath's Facebook page,

55
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,280
where there is a discussion about
a new Mexican restaurant in town

56
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,120
because, and I quote:
"We have one already."

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,520
There are, and I cannot stress
this enough, 189 comments.

58
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,000
We don't have time to go
into the whole thing,

59
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,240
but one particular thread
starts with:

60
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,840
"So we're going to have 2 sit
down restaurants", misspelled,

61
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,440
"in town, and they're both
Mexican food ?"

62
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,360
"We're supposed to be excited ?
Seems like poor planning to me."

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,280
And escalates to the point where
this delightful man says:

64
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,520
"I don't much like the overall
tone of your posts sir..."

65
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,920
"I just googled what a cuck was
and I'm extremely offended."

66
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,400
It's the entire internet encapsulated
in two comments. Heath seems lovely.

67
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,600
To be fair to Ratcliffe, he did
also serve as a US attorney.

68
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,920
Although, it was for less than a year,
on an interim basis

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,640
and his resume seems to have
inflated what happened in that time.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,680
In his congressional bio,
Ratcliffe claims that during that time

71
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,800
he put terrorists in prison, but
a CNN search of terror related cases

72
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,440
doesn't show any
that Ratcliffe prosecuted

73
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,160
and his office
couldn't offer examples or evidence.

74
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,240
In that same congressional bio,
Ratcliffe also says

75
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,040
he "arrested 300 illegal aliens
in a single day",

76
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,640
even though it was a multi-state,
multi-agency operation

77
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,200
to sweep up
suspected illegal workers.

78
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,120
45 workers were charged by Ratcliffe's
office, six of whom were dismissed.

79
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,720
Ratcliffe said he arrested
"300 illegal aliens in a single day,"

80
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,800
when his office only charged 45,
a pretty audacious lie !

81
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,120
Seems weird to be upset about
somebody not arresting as they said,

82
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,600
but it also seems weird
not to be upset.

83
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,080
It's like if your friend told you
he once took 300 poopies in a day,

84
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,640
when he really only took 45.

85
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,920
Why are you bragging about that,
why are you lying about that,

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,160
why do you use such a reprehensible
phrase for that

87
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,400
and why is the real number
still so upsettingly high ?

88
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:45,160
Five days after Trump's announcement
tweet, Ratcliffe was out.

89
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,280
It would be
a remarkable flame-out,

90
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,680
were it not for the fact that Trump
is putting forward people

91
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,600
who fall apart under scrutiny.

92
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,040
He's lost his picks to allegations
of conflicts of interest,

93
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,280
plagiarism, a workplace affair,
offensive blog posts, being an idiot,

94
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,360
being the actual Herman Cain
or being flamboyantly unqualified.

95
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,000
It's not just Ratcliffe
in that last category.

96
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,640
Trump nominated Sam Clovis

97
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,680
as the Department of Agriculture's
chief scientist,

98
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,000
despite the fact
he was not a scientist.

99
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,200
He was a talk radio host.

100
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,840
He was confident
in his scientific instinct,

101
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,840
as you can hear in this assessment
of climate change.

102
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,840
I have looked at the science and
I have enough of a science background

103
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,280
to know when I'm being boofed,
a lot of what we see is junk science.

104
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:37,120
Wait. His science background
taught him about boofing ?

105
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,200
We learned from the Brett Kavanaugh
hearing

106
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,080
that "boof" either means
"farting" or "anal sex",

107
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,280
so I truly hope that Clovis is aware
of when he's being boofed.

108
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,360
I'm not sure that's something
they teach you in science class.

109
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,000
A track record like that
would embarrass the administration

110
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,960
and make them want to improve
their vetting process.

111
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,640
As Trump clarified on Friday,
letting randomly selected idiots

112
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,840
be publicly torn apart by
the national media is his process.

113
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,000
No, you vet for me.
I like when you vet. No, you vet.

114
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,880
White House has a great vetting
process. You vet for me.

115
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,000
When I give a name, I give it out
to the press and you vet for me.

116
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,720
I give out a name to the press
and they vet for me.

117
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,960
We save money that way.

118
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,240
The process is "make a decision
without thinking"

119
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,320
"and trust that someone else
will do your job for you."

120
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,840
Hearing: "You vet for me"
from the president

121
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,600
is only less alarming than
hearing it from a vet.

122
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,800
"You vet for me.
I dunno if Gus is fine or not."

123
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,000
"I'll give you the cat, you vet
for me, we save a lot of money."

124
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,400
Donald Trump chooses his cabinet
and appointees

125
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,280
with the thought and care
he does everything else.

126
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,280
Absolutely none. While there is not
a lot that we can do in the short term,

127
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,760
next time he announces a new
tremendous appointee on Twitter,

128
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,280
we can all say: "No way.
I know when I'm being boofed."

129
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,320
And now this.

130
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,960
Fox News's Shep Smith Has A Weird
Favorite Expression.

131
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,000
I would think he wouldn't be
happy about this.

132
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,200
He's been dreaming about hitting
the Iranians since Fluff was a kitten,

133
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,720
she's a full-grown cat.

134
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,080
That walk across the lawn that
presidents have been doing

135
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,080
since Fluff was a kitten
and she's a full-grown cat.

136
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,760
Clinton campaign's been raising
money since Fluff was a kitten.

137
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,680
They've been working on it
since Fluff was a kitten.

138
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,520
Steve Doocy's been on it
since Fluff was a kitten.

139
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,440
When Fluff was a kitten.
Since Fluff was a kitten.

140
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,160
Fluff was a kitten and she's
a fullgrown cat.

141
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,480
- Where is Fluff ?
- Full-grown cat.

142
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,960
Teams steal signs since
Fluff was a kitten.

143
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,600
She's in a nursing home.

144
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,320
That robot's been around since
Fluff was a kitten

145
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,960
and Fluff is on her last leg.

146
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,280
He's with us since Fluff was
a kitten. She is close to death.

147
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,960
Fluff is long since buried.

148
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,920
I'm not gonna let you go
'til you tell me who Fluff is.

149
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,040
Fluff is a kitten. Nana used to talk
about Fluff. Anytime things were old,

150
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,640
Nana would say: "That's been
around since Fluff was a kitten."

151
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,480
I've been saying since Nana said it,
it's good enough for everybody !

152
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,040
All right. I love it.
I might start using it.

153
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,600
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns prison.

154
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,520
And if you are unfamiliar
with the concept,

155
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,520
I'll let a children's
entertainer explain it to you,

156
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,760
in a clip that
has in no way dated badly.

157
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,200
All of those people
who are in prison right now

158
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,840
were kids once,
just like you.

159
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,120
Somewhere along the way,
they did something wrong, dumb.

160
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,240
Whatever it was, it probably
started small, became bigger.

161
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Maybe they got away with it at first
and thought they'd never get caught.

162
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,120
They were wrong.
Now they're in prison.

163
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:59,600
Yes, they are. It's almost like they
should've really seen this coming.

164
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,880
We've talked before about
the problems of mass incarceration.

165
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,880
This story isn't about who is in prison
or whether they should be there.

166
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,880
It's about what they are doing
while they are inside.

167
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,280
Broadly,
it's a story about prison labor.

168
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,920
Over 60 percent of people
in prison have jobs.

169
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,120
Prisons are operated by the inmates,
as you would know,

170
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,400
if you've ever seen an episode
of "Lockup: Raw" on MSNBC.

171
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,840
The most common jobs are working
in the kitchen or janitorial duty.

172
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,360
I clean carpet,
vacuum, empty trash.

173
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,200
I work in laundry,
five days a week.

174
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,160
He has landed one of the most coveted
inmate jobs, staff canteen clerk.

175
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,040
I didn't come into prison
with a staff canteen job.

176
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,560
I started in food service
and worked my way through the ranks.

177
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,240
Oprah didn't start on
"The Oprah Winfrey show." So...

178
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,160
He is right of course. Oprah didn't
start on "The Oprah Winfrey Show".

179
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,760
A glowing magical orb
consolidated all of the earth's energy

180
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,520
into one mesmerizing,
perfect beacon of light.

181
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,400
Then, the light fucked the orb.
And the result was Oprah.

182
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,920
That's Oprah's origin story.
There are some major differences

183
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,880
between the jobs people do in prison
and the ones they do on the outside,

184
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,000
particularly
when it comes to money.

185
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,120
The average wage in prisons
is around 63 cents per hour.

186
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,960
Remember:
that's the average.

187
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,120
That means there are states
where prisoners make less.

188
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,320
In Texas, Georgia, Arkansas
and Alabama,

189
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,920
prisoners are not paid
for their work at all.

190
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,000
In some places, they work
under threat of disciplinary action.

191
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,200
If they say:
"No, I'm not gonna work",

192
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,680
they can write you up,
send you to solitary.

193
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,680
Now that's slavery.
To work for free...

194
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,120
And they can put
you in solitary if you don't work

195
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,000
or write you up
for not working ?

196
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,120
For free ?
Why is that not slavery ?

197
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,880
Yeah, that's not good.
"Why is that not slavery ?"

198
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,080
is one of those questions that,
even if you have to ask it,

199
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,360
something has already gone
very wrong.

200
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
Like:
"How many swastika tattoos ?"

201
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,600
or "Which of mommy's nightstand
drawers did you open ?"

202
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,760
Things are already bad. We just
need to figure out how bad.

203
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,520
The answer to
"Why is this not slavery" is:

204
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,120
"It's not exactly not slavery."

205
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,400
Treating prisoners as slaves
is written into the Constitution.

206
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,440
The 13th Amendment
states that slavery is abolished,

207
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,880
except as a punishment
for a crime.

208
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,760
The amendment abolishing slavery
is really not the one that you want

209
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,000
to suddenly
include the word "except".

210
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,320
To many, inmates are not a naturally
sympathetic group of people.

211
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,280
When there was a push to get a higher
wage for those working behind bars,

212
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,280
these people on Fox
found it hilarious.

213
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,000
Inmates are suing for minimum wage
for the work they're doing behind bars.

214
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,560
Should that be a crime ?

215
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:01,440
He says he deserves minimum
wage. As if crime pays !

216
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,160
Why let crime pay ?

217
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,360
Crime should not pay !
Common sense is very simple.

218
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,360
"Common sense
is very simple."

219
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,960
If you watch that on mute,
you would definitely assume

220
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,320
it was a panel
on erectile dysfunction.

221
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,080
Even with the sound on,
you can't definitely say it's not.

222
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,760
In a way, I actually get it.

223
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,880
"Crime doesn't pay"
does sound like common sense.

224
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,360
It's much more complicated
than that.

225
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,920
When combine the low to nonexistent
wages that prisoners get paid

226
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
with the high costs they
can incur while they're inside,

227
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,760
the current system
can wind up costing all of us.

228
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,240
We're gonna look into how
prisoners make and spend money

229
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,480
and the companies that have
managed to get rich off them.

230
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,040
Prison labor
can take many forms.

231
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,600
It is often the janitorial or kitchen
work that you saw earlier,

232
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,600
but in some states, prisoners
work as firefighters.

233
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,840
In the California wildfires last year,

234
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,080
12 percent of the firefighters
were current inmates.

235
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,920
Many of them find fighting
fires very rewarding.

236
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:11,680
Just the other day we were able
to save houses from burning down.

237
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,600
To have a woman come out
to her backyard and thank us

238
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,280
for saving her house makes us
feel like we're doing something.

239
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,040
Being able to give back

240
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:29,840
and potentially save lives
it's huge.

241
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,400
Makes sense. Being able to save
lives must be very satisfying.

242
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,360
It's why Batman always seems
to be in such a good mood.

243
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,800
And why his catchphrase is:
"I'm Batman !"

244
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,320
"How great is fighting crime ?
It's great, I love it."

245
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,520
That feels like the best-case
scenario for prison labor:

246
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,600
people who are happy to work,
contributing to society

247
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,240
and learning new skills.

248
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:59,160
Those firefighters' base pay
is between 3 and 5 dollars per day.

249
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,480
If you think: "At least they're learning
skills that'll help them get a job,"

250
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,200
that is often not the case...

251
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,280
California law bars most people
with a criminal record

252
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,000
from becoming licensed
emergency responders.

253
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,200
A firefighter in prison is not unlike
being an art history major in college.

254
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,280
It may be fun while you're in there,

255
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,080
but you're not gonna be doing it
once you get out.

256
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,160
Hear that, Thessaly ?
You'll work in human resources,

257
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,720
you'll have a favorite coffee
mug and a pillow

258
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,120
that says
"It's Wine O'clock Somewhere",

259
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,680
yearning for the sweet
release of death...

260
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,720
Just. Like. Everybody. Else.

261
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,720
Fighting fires is far from the only
dangerous job prisoners do.

262
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,520
At Louisiana State Penitentiary,
some take part in a prison rodeo,

263
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,960
where the entertainment
can be insane.

264
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,160
Take convict poker... Four inmates
sit nervously at a card table

265
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,960
while a very restless bull
picks out his target.

266
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,760
The last one standing
or sitting wins.

267
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,440
Why do you do this ?

268
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,400
Money. I'm broke. I'm trying to get
a private investigator on my case.

269
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,200
He earns two cents an hour
working in the prison fields

270
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,800
but he can earn hundreds
out in that mud.

271
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,400
Holy shit !
That is truly shocking.

272
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,240
Look, this really isn't
the biggest issue there,

273
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,880
but if you are going to have a game
where a bull attacks people,

274
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,160
you don't name it "convict poker",
you name it dodge bull.

275
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,000
Not the biggest issue,
but I did want to bring it up.

276
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,280
Being attacked by a bull for
entertainment is an outlier.

277
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,920
Most prisoners are doing routine
labor, for little to no money.

278
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,120
That can lead to them being seen less
as humans paying their debt to society

279
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,720
and more as a pool
of virtually free labor.

280
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,720
Don't take that from me, listen
to Louisiana sheriff Steve Prator.

281
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,560
When the state, as part
of a prison reform program,

282
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,520
started releasing inmates, he went
public with an unusual complaint.

283
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,280
In addition to the bad ones
and I call these bad...

284
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,920
In addition to them,
they're releasing some good ones

285
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,480
that we use every day to wash cars,
to change oil in our cars,

286
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,120
to cook in the kitchens,
to do all that.

287
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,320
It's where we save money.
They're gonna let them out.

288
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,960
The ones we use in the work release
program, they'll let them out.

289
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,080
Think about
what he's saying there.

290
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,880
He's saying some people need to stay
behind bars

291
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,960
because they're too valuable
as a source of free labor.

292
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,040
The same plan as the villain in
the "The Shawshank Redemption".

293
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,680
To qualify
as a Stephen King villain,

294
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,880
you have to be something
way less stupid, like an evil car

295
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,960
or a guy who forgot
to wear a coat.

296
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:53,480
Many prisoners do prefer having jobs
to just sitting in their cells all day.

297
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:58,480
Getting rid of prison labor entirely
is not the answer here.

298
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,320
Paying prisoners more might help.
Although that will be difficult.

299
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,200
Prisons are so reliant
on their labor,

300
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,320
moving to a competitive wage could
cost millions of dollars each year.

301
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,600
There are those out
there who might say:

302
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,920
"What do prisoners
even need money for ?"

303
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,080
The answer is really important.
Because while it may seem

304
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,400
like you're living
for free in prison,

305
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,840
you may actually
have a lot of expenses,

306
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,760
like legal fees, or basic necessities,
like soap, or shampoo.

307
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,160
And as lawmakers in Arizona
discovered,

308
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,720
prisons were requiring women
to buy personal hygiene products.

309
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,200
There's a new bill
that would have the state pay

310
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,360
for all feminine hygiene products.

311
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,360
First to hear the proposal,
a committee of nine men,

312
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,320
some a bit squeamish
about taking on the task.

313
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,560
Hearing the bill
was something I didn't expect.

314
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,440
I didn't expect to hear pads
and tampons

315
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,920
and the problems of periods.

316
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,880
Two things...
"The Problem Of Periods" sounds

317
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,280
like the title of a medical textbook
written back in the time

318
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,640
when we used to treat female emotions
with either electrocution or drowning.

319
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,800
I am shocked that a man who
willingly chose that haircut

320
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,760
isn't more
of an expert on women.

321
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,240
Until last year,
Arizona's female prisoners

322
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,520
were allotted just
12 pads per month,

323
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,720
which as I am going to say
at least half of you know

324
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,800
often isn't nearly enough.

325
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,040
Extra hygiene products
were not a minor expense.

326
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,840
Base pay for prisoners
starts at 15 cents an hour.

327
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:40,160
To buy one additional pack of pads,
took about 21 hours of work.

328
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,920
In theory, women who needed
more could simply ask prison guards

329
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,800
or get a medical dispensation.

330
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,280
In Arizona,
as in many places,

331
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,120
prisoners also have to pay
a co-pay to see a doctor.

332
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,840
I'll let a former prisoner tell you
how that worked out in reality.

333
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,360
The most important thing
if I want to request the medical right

334
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,280
to get more pads because say
I have a heavier flow this month,

335
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,440
I would have to pay 4 dollars
just to be seen by medical.

336
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,680
When I'm making 9 cents after tax,
you gotta really think

337
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,640
if I want to put my whole month's
income for extra pads.

338
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,360
If they believe I deserve it.

339
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,320
Not only is it ridiculous that
she needs to pay to make a case

340
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,480
that she deserves access to pads,
spare a thought for her

341
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,840
having to discuss the details of
a heavy flow into this bewildered face.

342
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,960
For many prisoners,
there is an enormous gap

343
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,200
between what they make in prison
and having enough for necessities.

344
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,800
If they are lucky, they might
have family or others on the outside

345
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,520
willing to help them out
by sending them money.

346
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,120
Even that is more
complicated than it appears

347
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,800
and this brings us
to the final absurd element:

348
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,680
the for-profit companies between
prisoners and the outside world.

349
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,600
Let's say you want to send money to
your incarcerated son or daughter.

350
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,160
One of the biggest companies
that lets families do that is JPay.

351
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,520
But there is a catch.

352
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,120
In lots of states, families have to go
through JPay to send money in a prison.

353
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,280
For 450 000 families, JPay is
the only way to send an inmate money

354
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,000
and the company charges them
fees as high as 45 percent.

355
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,000
To give to him 50 dollars, I have
to send 70 off of my card.

356
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,880
It's hardest on people like Pat Taylor
who are barely scraping by.

357
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,600
I let a bill go and pick it up later.

358
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,000
It's true. It costs her 20 dollars
just to send 50 !

359
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,320
Look out, Ticketmaster !

360
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,640
When it comes to dickish fees,
there's a new asshole in town.

361
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,360
Charging families to transfer money
isn't the only way companies profit.

362
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,960
JPay's parent company, Securus,
is also a leader in the field

363
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,160
of charging prisoners
for phone calls and video visits,

364
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,720
which is a 1.2 billion dollars
a-year industry.

365
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,200
Securus has ads which play
like a shitty Apple commercial,

366
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,200
but make it look like
it's a warm, fuzzy company,

367
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,080
focused
on human connections.

368
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,720
It's nice that they are fully
acknowledging how important it is

369
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,280
for people to connect
to others on the phone.

370
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,880
It's a lesson that AT&T
would do well to take.

371
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,760
You suck it, business daddy !

372
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,000
Business baby ain't never getting
in line. This baby rides dirty.

373
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,280
I'm fussy. Don't rub my tummy.
I won't be settled.

374
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,400
What that ad doesn't make clear

375
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,400
is how expensive they
made those vital connections.

376
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,240
Phone calls within states
can go over a dollar per minute.

377
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,840
Facilities served by Securus have
had fees over 3 dollars

378
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,560
for the first minute and
16 cents for each additional one.

379
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,280
And that can really add up,
which can be a problem

380
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,000
for families
who may have limited resources.

381
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,440
Shayna is married to a man with
a seven and-a-half year sentence.

382
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,200
Palles has been paying
high telephone fees,

383
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,080
trying to keep her daughter connected
to her father however she can.

384
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,640
Where'd Daddy go ?
Look !

385
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,320
At 6 dollars a call, keeping
that connection isn't easy.

386
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,160
Some might not see 6 dollars
as a lot but when you have an infant

387
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,240
6 dollars is half
of a pack of diapers.

388
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,840
And that is rough.
You should not have to choose

389
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,240
between letting your kid talk
to her dad and buying diapers.

390
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,920
That is the definition
of a shitty situation.

391
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,920
If you curtail
or remove that connection,

392
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,400
it can have serious consequences
on life inside the prison.

393
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,920
All a lot of guys have
when they're incarcerated

394
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,800
are those phone calls,
those letters, those visits.

395
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,600
That's what they live for, that's how
they get through their time.

396
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,200
I've seen guys, their family didn't
come see them in a week or two

397
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,760
and the next thing you know they
ended up in the hole for 90 days.

398
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,800
You can't build a family in prison.

399
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,120
Contact with families
is incredibly important.

400
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,800
"In the hole for 90 days" is also
how Sting describes a quickie.

401
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,960
If you are thinking: "Maybe families
can just get around phone charges"

402
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,360
"by visiting their loved ones
in person",

403
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,760
they can,
although that is changing, too.

404
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,880
Prisons and, especially, jails, have
been phasing out in-person visits,

405
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,680
in favor of video visitation.

406
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,160
You can turn up to see a loved one
and sit in a different room

407
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,880
and talk to them on a screen.

408
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,440
This is something Securus
has contractually mandated.

409
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,680
Up until 2015, some of their
contracts with facilities

410
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,040
had them promise to eliminate
all face to face visitation.

411
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,800
And that is evil.
"Machine that makes money"

412
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,600
"by stopping people from seeing
their families"

413
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,880
sounds like an item at the top
of Satan's Amazon Wish List.

414
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,000
Right before "super-bedbugs",
"cauliflower rice"

415
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,520
and "just the actual
existence of Amazon."

416
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,480
While this sounds inhumane,
the people running these facilities

417
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,800
will insist that the reason for it
is purely a safety issue.

418
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,360
If you limit the people
who are coming in,

419
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,440
you're going to limit
the attempts of contraband.

420
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,800
No contraband.

421
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,840
You'll not introduce
contraband into the jail.

422
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,280
I get it,
so it's a contraband issue.

423
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,560
The problem
is that research shows

424
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,280
that installing video visitation
does not decrease contraband,

425
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,040
because it's easier
for it to come in other ways,

426
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,440
like through guards, staff
and occasionally through owls.

427
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,760
Although, admittedly,
that is mostly an Azkaban problem.

428
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,720
Why push video visitation so hard ?
It is difficult to say.

429
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,680
I will point out it seems notable
that jails and prisons often get a cut

430
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,600
of the proceeds
from phone and video calls.

431
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,920
They point out the money
goes into an "inmate welfare fund",

432
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,480
that fund is often used for things
other than "inmate welfare".

433
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,200
One county spent three-quarters
of that money on staff salaries,

434
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,240
while another dipped into it
to buy Tasers.

435
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:01,840
Which stretches the definition of
"inmate welfare" to a shocking degree.

436
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,320
When you put all of this together,

437
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,760
you're not just hurting
the people who are incarcerated,

438
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,800
you hurt
everyone around them.

439
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,560
One in three families of inmates
reported going into debt

440
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,720
to pay for phone calls
or visitation.

441
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,680
That doesn't set up a prisoner for
success once they are released.

442
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,240
The current system of low wages
and high costs is clearly no good

443
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,880
for anyone but for the companies
who are managing to massively profit.

444
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,320
There are things that we can do.
NYC made phone calls from jails free

445
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,920
and Connecticut will consider
similar legislation next year.

446
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,240
If we want to pay prisoners more,
we could do that.

447
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,560
Although, it would undeniably be
incredibly expensive and unpopular.

448
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,720
You saw people argue: crime doesn't
pay, that's just common sense.

449
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,080
Part of the way mass incarceration
persists in this country

450
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,040
is by keeping the true costs
of it off the books.

451
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,600
We're doing that through a combination
of underpaid labor from prisoners,

452
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,920
financially draining families
who've done nothing wrong

453
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,440
and managing
to monetize prisoners

454
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,400
being launched into
the air with livestock.

455
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:18,320
We've come a long, long way
from common sense. And now this.

456
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,960
What The Fuck Is Going On
With New York City's Raccoons ?

457
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,280
Raccoons running amuck,
breaking into homes,

458
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,440
and leaving behind a big mess.

459
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,360
On most nights in Central Park,
a feeding frenzy takes place.

460
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,000
- They eat bread, they like pizza.
- They're hungry all the time.

461
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,440
They're out during the daytime,
when they should be sleeping.

462
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,160
He stood on two legs
and he hissed at me.

463
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,960
This three-year-old Maltese,
Snowball,

464
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,360
who used to love to play outside
is now a prisoner in his own home.

465
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,360
He refuses to go out in the yard.

466
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,680
Raccoon experts are not surprised.

467
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,520
Once they've been trapped once,

468
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,000
they'll know not to go
into that trap again.

469
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,400
From the window,
he headed to the pantry,

470
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,360
took out the cat food, unscrewed it
and helped himself.

471
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,200
Ate peanuts and washed
his paws in the cat's dish.

472
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,640
A raccoon removed
the wrapper from a lollypop.

473
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,920
Like with hands ?

474
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,120
The caller reported seeing a tiger
in Washington Heights.

475
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,200
You see all types of things here.
Can't tell you much about no tiger.

476
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,760
- Anything confirmed on that tiger ?
- It was a raccoon.

477
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,280
It wasn't a tiger,
it was a raccoon...

478
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,160
That's our show, thanks for watching.
See you next week, good night !

479
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,520
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

480
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,160
END OF EPISODE 19,
SEASON VI
