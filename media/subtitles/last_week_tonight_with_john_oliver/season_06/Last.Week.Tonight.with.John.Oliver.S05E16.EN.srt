LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,480
SEASON VI
EPISODE 16

3
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,320
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,960
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,800
We begin with President Trump,
of whom the best thing you can say

6
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,480
is: "Maybe he's never
eaten a dolphin. Maybe."

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,200
He had a busy week. He was accused
of a horrifying sexual assault,

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,480
he promised massive I.C.E. raids,
to change course at the last second

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,960
and he brought us
up to the brink of war with Iran.

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,200
24 hours after Iran downed
an unmanned U.S. drone,

11
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,280
the U.S. military
was ready to strike back.

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,160
But the president made
a sudden reversal.

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,360
We were about to attack Iran,
but Trump had a change of heart.

14
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,800
Just on the attack part,
not a change of heart in general.

15
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,800
He didn't have an Ebenezer Scrooge
moment where he yelled:

16
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,880
"I'm going
to be good from now on !"

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,240
No, he just didn't
bomb some people.

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,200
This was the latest development
in escalating tensions with Iran.

19
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,160
The U.S. drone that Iran shot down
was not just any drone.

20
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,080
This drone, as he said,
costs up to $180 million.

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,440
So, this is not some drone
you're getting off of Amazon.

22
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,480
This is an aircraft that
belongs to our government.

23
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,600
We all knew this isn't some drone
you're getting off Amazon.

24
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,080
No one out there thought
you say:

25
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,560
"Alexa, surveil the Iranians" and
Alexa sends a drone to Iran.

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,640
Normally, the U.S. might coordinate
an international response.

27
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,880
But our regular allies
have been slow to come to our side,

28
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,760
perhaps they believe Trump's part
of the reason Iran is acting out.

29
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,400
He pulled out of the Iran Deal
and imposed sanctions on them

30
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,920
and any countries
buying Iranian oil.

31
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,920
Or, as one German official put it,
the Americans "created this mess"

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,360
"and now they
have to find a way to get out."

33
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,040
This left Trump isolated.
Even domestically,

34
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,280
he was stuck between
warring factions

35
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,480
both in his administration
and on his favorite network.

36
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,120
Some anchors were pro-war,
like Sean Hannity,

37
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,760
while Greg Gutfeld
had an interesting theory

38
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,120
as to why war with Iran
would be painless.

39
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,440
We're now in a time where it doesn't
matter how large your population is,

40
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,120
because the population
is no longer expendable in war.

41
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,520
It's now about the machines.
Drones are now replacing bones,

42
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,920
so it'll be stuff versus stuff
and we have the best stuff.

43
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,160
That is breathtakingly stupid.

44
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,120
If someone said that to me
at a dinner party,

45
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,240
my response would be:
"Excuse me, this child is drunk."

46
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,840
Someone gave him wine
but he's ranting like a lunatic

47
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,440
about how war
is all 'stuff versus stuff' now.

48
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,080
He needs to be put to bed.

49
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,880
Now, on the other side,
Tucker Carlson took time away

50
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,040
from perfecting the art of racist
befuddlement to tell Trump:

51
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,600
"responding to Tehran's provocations
with force was crazy."

52
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,680
The voice of reason here
was a man who wore a bow tie

53
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,800
well into his 40s despite
being as not in the Nation of Islam

54
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,680
as a person could possibly be.

55
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,040
With everyone giving
Trump conflicting advice,

56
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,520
we were forced
to watch him think out loud.

57
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,200
He tried to reason through why what
Iran did wasn't so bad.

58
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,160
Fortunately,
that drone was unarmed.

59
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:54,240
There was no man in it.
It was over international waters.

60
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,600
We didn't have a man or woman in
the drone. We had nobody in the drone.

61
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,200
There was nobody in the drone.
Because that would've made it,

62
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,640
and I'm gonna throw some
military jargon at you here, a plane.

63
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:14,080
I'm glad Trump didn't end up dragging
us towards an unnecessary war.

64
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,160
But the manner in which we got so close
should be a genuine concern.

65
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,720
After calling off the strike,
he walked us through his decision

66
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,960
and it is chilling to watch
40 seconds of his mind at work.

67
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,320
They said: "Sir, we're ready
to go. We'd like a decision."

68
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,040
I said: "I want to know something.
How many people will be killed ?"

69
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,920
In this case, Iranians. I said:
"How many are going to be killed ?"

70
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,000
"Sir, I'd like
to get back to you on that."

71
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,040
Great people, these generals.
Came back, said:

72
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,000
"Sir, approximately 150."
I thought about it for a second.

73
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,920
I said: "They shot down
an unmanned drone, plane,"

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,120
"and here we are sitting
with 150 dead people"

75
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,200
"that would've taken place within
a half an hour after 'Go'."

76
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,840
And I didn't like it.

77
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,280
I'm actually glad you didn't like it.
But it's amazing to watch him

78
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,360
do the right thing in the same style
that he does the wrong thing.

79
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,920
Many of the same ingredients
were there:

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,520
joyously quoting people
calling him "Sir",

81
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,400
expressing childlike disbelief
he gets to hang out with generals,

82
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,560
needlessly pointing out the potential
dead were "in this case Iranians",

83
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,960
identifying what was shot down
as a drone before correcting it

84
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,880
to the wrong answer of "plane",

85
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,800
and telling a lie
that makes him look good.

86
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,760
No way he wasn't
told about potential casualties

87
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,040
the moment the plan
was presented to him.

88
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,600
Considering the ingredients, this
might've been the best outcome.

89
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,480
It's like watching someone put
chicken guts, Jell-O, and human hair

90
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,080
into an oven and then
take out a cake 20 minutes later.

91
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,560
I'm relieved and sort of amazed
with where we ended up.

92
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,280
I'm worried that next time,

93
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,080
if you put the same garbage
through this process,

94
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,600
this probably isn't gonna be the result
we're all going to get.

95
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,840
And now, this.

96
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,680
Can Meghan McCain
Just Say One Thing ?

97
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,560
Can I say one thing too ?
As the Republican on the show...

98
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,160
Can I say one thing, really ?
Can I say just one more quick thing ?

99
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,000
Can I say one thing really quickly ?
Can I say something now ?

100
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,520
- Can I say something now ?
- You just have to do a little digging.

101
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,320
Can I say one final thing ?
Can I say something ?

102
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,000
Can I say something really quick ?
Can I say something ?

103
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,560
Can I say one final thing ?
Could I just interject ?

104
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,120
Can I just ask one more question ?
Can I say one thing, though ?

105
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,680
Can I say one thing ?
'Cause we know each other.

106
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,640
Can I say one thing ?
Can I just jump in really quick ?

107
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,960
Can I say something really quick ?
Can I say one more thing ?

108
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,840
- Can I just say really quick ?
- No. Let me just finish.

109
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,040
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns Mount Everest.

110
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,800
It's no longer just a mountain,

111
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,280
it's everyone's go-to metaphor
for a significant challenge.

112
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,960
It's the Mount Everest
of ice cream sundaes.

113
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,720
The Everest of bar food.
The homemade tater tot.

114
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,000
Adam is 20 minutes in,
and he has two and a half dozen left.

115
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,120
This oyster tower is my Everest.

116
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,600
Is it ?
'Cause it really shouldn't be.

117
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,640
When you host a show called
"Man versus Food",

118
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,280
living past 50 with your original
heart should be your Everest.

119
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,040
Everest was first summited
in 1953

120
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,480
by Sir Edmund Hillary
and Tenzing Norgay.

121
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,240
Before, it had seemed
an almost impossible feat.

122
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,680
But as you may've seen,

123
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,320
since then, climbing Everest has
become dangerously popular.

124
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,440
On top of the world, a deadly climbing
season growing more dangerous.

125
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,840
11 killed,
including three Americans.

126
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,040
New video of that line
to reach the top of the world.

127
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,720
Climbers stood in freezing conditions
waiting to get to the peak

128
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,720
and some were pushing
and jostling for photographs

129
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,640
on a space the size of two Ping-Pong
tables thousands of meters up.

130
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,120
Holy shit. The only thing more
dangerous than jostling for photos

131
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,880
on a mountaintop the size
of two Ping-Pong tables

132
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,280
is jostling for photos on two
actual Ping-Pong tables.

133
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,960
11 deaths at Delta Chi house.
Nine of them sad.

134
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,440
Climbing Mount Everest
has somehow gone

135
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,120
from being a rare feat
of extraordinary skill,

136
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,160
to something that looks like
the line at Trader Joe's.

137
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,120
The mountain gets littered with trash.
A cleanup expedition this year

138
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,760
brought down 24 000 pounds
of garbage.

139
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,360
There is also a lot of human
shit up the mountain,

140
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,000
which thanks in part to climate
change, is now sliding downhill,

141
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,600
in what's been called
"a fecal time bomb".

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,080
Which is a phrase that should be
printed on every baby onesie.

143
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,000
It's cute and it's accurate.

144
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,480
Let's look at what is causing
these issues,

145
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,920
how Everest's climbing
industry operates

146
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,880
and how we can make things safer.

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,800
There's actually nothing new
about this overcrowding problem.

148
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,800
Look at this eerily familiar story
from 2012.

149
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,760
These are images
from high up on Everest.

150
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,240
The path to the peak
clogged with climbers,

151
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,640
as many as 200
gambling with their very lives.

152
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,680
Everest is just
as ridiculously popular today

153
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,600
as it was seven years ago.

154
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,240
There's not many things
you can say that about,

155
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,520
it's basically Everest,
Rickrolling and that's about it.

156
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,360
There's a number of reasons
that explain the persistence

157
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,240
of the crowds at Everest,
as this Sherpa explains.

158
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,200
Never gonna give you up,
Never gonna let you down,

159
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,000
Never gonna run around
And desert you.

160
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,000
It's still fun. You didn't
see it coming and it's still fun.

161
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:09,200
One reason for overcrowding is that
you can't climb to the top whenever,

162
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,200
there is one major summiting window,
which lasts about 10 days in May.

163
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,720
And in some years, like this one,
bad weather shrinks that time

164
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,200
down to just a few days.

165
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,520
Which was fine when climbing
Everest was relatively rare.

166
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,280
For the first 35 years
after Hillary and Norgay,

167
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,000
there were just 260 ascents.

168
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,040
The 1990s saw the advent
of commercial expeditions,

169
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,840
clients paying for mountain guides
and Sherpas to help them,

170
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,520
causing that number to explode
to over 1 900 by 2003.

171
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,080
And there's now been
over 9 000 successful summits.

172
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,160
With that many people going up,
you might think it's hard to stand out.

173
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,400
Some have bent over backwards
to make their climb unique,

174
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,320
from the oldest to get to the top,
to the youngest, to all this nonsense.

175
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,160
Ben and Shaunna
will be the first Canadian couple

176
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,200
to make it to the summit
of Everest together.

177
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,640
In 2001, Stephan Gatt was the first
to snowboard off the summit,

178
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,360
while husband and wife team
Bertrand and Claire Roche

179
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,600
became the first people
to fly off the top in a paraglider.

180
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,120
It's 5:40 A.M. and Rod's
reached 29 028 feet,

181
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,080
the highest point on earth.

182
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,960
But he's got one more goal:

183
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,120
to make the world's highest
ever cell phone call.

184
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,680
Nice work, Rod. The highest ever
cellphone call. That's incredible.

185
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,360
Or, it would've been, but Rod had
AT&T, so the call never went through.

186
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,280
I got you, Business Daddy !
I got you so good !

187
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,920
If I could get serious for a moment,

188
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,480
there is something
I've been meaning to say:

189
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,040
I know I give you a hard
time, Business Daddy,

190
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,120
but the truth is, you're
the only Business Daddy I have.

191
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,320
I know that
you want what's best for me.

192
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,720
It's not easy
having me as a Business Boy.

193
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't say this
as often as I should,

194
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,880
but I love you, Business Daddy.

195
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,800
I hope that we never lose
that special connection we have.

196
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,680
I'm so glad our connection
isn't on your wireless network,

197
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,720
'cause it's absolutely terrible.

198
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,680
I did it again !
I got you, Business Daddy.

199
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,120
Business Baby's out of control !
I'm acting up.

200
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,240
I'm sorry, where was I ?
That's right: Mount Everest.

201
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,200
Hundreds of people
now go up every year.

202
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,400
Commercial expeditions haven't
just increased access to the mountain,

203
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,360
they've also increased comforts.

204
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,200
There are now "luxury expeditions"
that can cost up to $130 000,

205
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,720
offering things like heated tents
with dining tables.

206
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,200
We should talk about how all those
amenities and, indeed, most climbers,

207
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,880
get up the mountain,
and that's with Sherpas.

208
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,520
The majority of expeditions
rely on Sherpas to do everything

209
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,760
from carrying supplies to putting up
tents to setting the ropes and ladders.

210
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,560
They are integral to commercial
expeditions, as this Sherpa will tell.

211
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,240
How many of the clients
that you see coming to Everest

212
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,320
could do it without you ?

213
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,800
- I would say zero.
- Zero ?

214
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,800
- None of them ?
- None.

215
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,640
For many climbers, Everest
is not unlike Simon and Garfunkel.

216
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,280
There is someone along
for the ride to the top

217
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,800
and there's someone
pulling all the weight.

218
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,840
I'm not saying who's who
and neither is Art Garfunkel,

219
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,960
unless Paul Simon
writes it for him.

220
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,240
Just a quick note regarding
Sherpas:

221
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,320
Sherpas, with an uppercase "S"
are an ethnic group.

222
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,240
Sherpas, lowercase "s"
are the mountain workers,

223
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,280
some of whom, but not all,
are Sherpas uppercase "S".

224
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,000
Extra fun fact: a word that changes
meaning when it's capitalized

225
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,640
is known as a "capitonym".

226
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,720
Now you have the perfect tidbit
handy next time you want

227
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,360
to self-destruct on a first date,
that's yours to have fun with.

228
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,520
Sherpas take on
a lot of responsibility and risk.

229
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,480
One of the most dangerous parts
of Everest involves

230
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,160
the Khumbu Icefall, a notoriously
deadly area

231
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,760
littered with gigantic blocks
of ice that can fall at any moment,

232
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,360
as well as huge crevasses.

233
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,720
Some Sherpas known
as "Icefall Doctors"

234
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,400
prepare the crossing
for climbers each season.

235
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,920
For a sense of just how
dangerous this job is,

236
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,960
take your anxiety medicine
of choice and watch this.

237
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,560
After four hours,
they're back at the crevasse.

238
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,680
It's so wide, three ladders
need to be latched together.

239
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,080
The first crossing is always
the most dangerous.

240
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,200
The risk is the unsecured end
will collapse.

241
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,880
Temba knows that the icefall doctor
he replaced died the previous year

242
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,800
on this mountain
down a crevasse.

243
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,800
Keep going forward.
Nice and easy.

244
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,040
Take it easy.
Don't get scared !

245
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,520
Wait: "Don't get scared ?"
The fuck are you talking about ?

246
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,720
That is very scary ! Fear is
the body's natural response.

247
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,480
That doesn't help. It's like telling
someone: "don't get thirsty"

248
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,160
or "don't be cold" or "don't sneeze
at this photo of Justin Long."

249
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,640
Why are none of you sneezing ?
You're being weird. Take that down !

250
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,000
I do know that I cut that clip
off there, and you're worried

251
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,440
about whether he made it
to the other side,

252
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,640
so let me just show you the end,
it's absolutely amazing.

253
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,760
I got you again ! It's still fun !
Rick's still got it.

254
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,680
That guy did make it across,
don't worry.

255
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,520
Even after the ropes and ladders
are fixed,

256
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,720
the Icefall is still dangerous
for those who cross it.

257
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,080
While clients may only have
to pass through it a few times,

258
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,800
Sherpas have to pass
through it far more often.

259
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,120
Time spent in the Icefall
is borrowed time

260
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,840
because the more time you spend
in it, the more likely you are

261
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,560
to be buried alive.

262
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,840
On each expedition as their
clients sleep in heated tents,

263
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,520
the Sherpas have to carry
the tourist gear through the Icefall

264
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,160
not once or twice,
but about 40 times,

265
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,960
40 times as baggage porters
through this valley of death.

266
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:34,000
40 times. That seems like
between 39 and 40 too many times.

267
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,400
It puts their customers' achievements
in a different context.

268
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,040
If your friend ran a marathon,
but only because someone else

269
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,440
ran a thousand miles back and forth,
bringing them Gatorade

270
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,880
and carrying a dining table,
you might not cheer quite so hard

271
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,200
at the finish line.

272
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,600
Everest Sherpa ranks among the most
dangerous occupations on earth.

273
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,600
Many are willing to do this,

274
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,520
because there aren't many jobs
that pay as well.

275
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,880
The fact they are risking their lives
for the ambitions of well-off climbers

276
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,440
is uncomfortable to square,
no matter how hard some might try.

277
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,280
Watch one TV presenter
ask his Sherpa to help him

278
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,440
grapple with the morality
of what he's asking him to do.

279
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,200
If I wasn't here,
you wouldn't be here.

280
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,880
And you wouldn't have
to go through the Icefall

281
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,520
and I know of the tragedies
that have happened,

282
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,480
so I'm fascinated to know
and I'd love to hear your thought

283
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,760
whether you think it's wrong
that we should be here ?

284
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,720
During our expedition,
we are like same family.

285
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,320
I love that.
Yeah, come here. Thank you.

286
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,320
I like those sentiments.
When we're away from family.

287
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,120
I agree. It's nice.

288
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,040
I love that description
that we're family.

289
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,320
It's not client and Sherpa.
We're in this together.

290
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,080
But it is client and Sherpa.

291
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,560
You jumped on his answer
real quick, there.

292
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,960
That Sherpa barely had time to get
it out before you were hugging him.

293
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,360
That is not the warm
embrace of family,

294
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,240
that's one man physically squeezing
the white guilt out of another.

295
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,920
Huge risks are being
taken by Sherpas

296
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,080
to give their clients the bragging
rights of conquering the mountain.

297
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,520
Purely in terms of the skills
needed to make it to the top,

298
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,040
Everest isn't actually the most
difficult mountain to climb.

299
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,640
Don't take that from me,
I don't know anything.

300
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,760
Mountaineers will tell you
the same.

301
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,760
Everest is a very difficult endeavor.
It's not a very technical mountain.

302
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,880
It doesn't require a lot
of technical climbing skill.

303
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,800
If you can get fit enough to keep
putting one foot in front of the other,

304
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,040
you can get up.

305
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,480
If you're going
with a commercial tour,

306
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,680
you don't need much technical
ability to climb Everest.

307
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,920
Theoretically, I could do it,
if I just trained a little.

308
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,440
I know what you're thinking:
with that body,

309
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,120
is there any way
you could be training harder ?

310
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,280
I'm a beast. Not a day goes by that
I don't sacrifice sweat

311
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,560
to the gods of swole
at the Temple of Iron.

312
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,880
I got a mortgage from Swell's Fargo

313
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,840
and I've been passing
plate ever since.

314
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,400
I call this one "Papier"
and this one "Maché"

315
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,640
because my shit is shredded.

316
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,400
While Everest doesn't require
much technical skill,

317
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,240
inexperience can still be deadly,
especially as you near the peak.

318
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,640
Climbers can experience something
called "summit fever".

319
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,240
They want to get to the top,

320
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,480
not considering whether they'll have
energy to get down.

321
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,120
It can be hard to make
good decisions up there,

322
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,400
the area above 26 000 feet
has only 30 percent of the oxygen

323
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,000
that there is at sea level.

324
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,000
It is called the "Death Zone",
what it can do to your body is brutal.

325
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,120
It's impossible to stay at these
heights for more than a few days.

326
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,160
The stomach stops digesting food,

327
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,280
the heart stops pumping blood
to the fingers and toes

328
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,480
and the brain
goes into meltdown.

329
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,560
Your brain is now swelling
because of the hypoxia.

330
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,600
It has nowhere to go because
it's constrained by your skull.

331
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,080
The only exit out of your skull is
where your spinal cord comes down.

332
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,120
Your brain is being squeezed
out of your skull.

333
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,320
Delightful. I'm surprised descriptions
didn't continue getting worse.

334
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,360
Your brain is squeezed out,
your nipples retract into your chest

335
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,680
and start stabbing your heart,
your kneecaps explode,

336
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,680
re-form, and then explode again,

337
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,480
and the bones in your arms and legs
switch places.

338
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,840
Ideally, inexperienced climbers

339
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,760
would not be allowed to try
something so dangerous.

340
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,040
But the limits on Everest
are very lax.

341
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,080
The limits on half
of Everest are very lax.

342
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,680
There are two major routes
that commercial expeditions follow.

343
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,880
One from the Tibetan side
and one from the Nepalese side.

344
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,480
The Tibet side is more
technically difficult

345
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,840
and the government has limits
on how many people can summit.

346
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,120
But the Nepal side is a little easier
and there are no limits

347
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,160
on how many climbing permits
the government issues.

348
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,880
You need to pay an $11 000 fee

349
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,960
and have a doctors' note
that deems you physically fit.

350
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,960
And that's a pretty big loophole,

351
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,720
even the least-physically-fit
person on earth

352
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,680
can get a glowing
doctor's note.

353
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,320
I know this for a fact
because he recently did.

354
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:21,360
A massive two-thirds
of climbers go up the Nepal side

355
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,560
and a shocking number of them
are unqualified to do that,

356
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,400
as a Nepalese official admits.

357
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,440
How many of the climbers
that you permit to climb,

358
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,080
do you think
are well qualified ?

359
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,560
- Maybe around 50, 55 percent ?
- 50 percent ? Half ?

360
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,520
Only half are qualified !

361
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,640
Then why are you
letting the other half climb ?

362
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,040
If Cirque du Soleil had
half its trapeze artists

363
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,800
be trained acrobats and the other
half enthusiasts with $11 000

364
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,360
and their own tiger bodysuit,
you would shut that shit down

365
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,400
before someone got badly hurt.

366
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,200
Nepal relies
heavily on tourism revenue,

367
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,400
so they've been slow
to make changes.

368
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,440
They are not the only ones
to blame.

369
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,360
Guiding companies could
also turn down unqualified climbers.

370
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,240
Many good ones do.
Unfortunately, many bad ones do not.

371
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,880
Take Shriya Shah-Klorfine,
a Canadian woman who decided

372
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,840
to climb Everest, despite having
no serious climbing experience.

373
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,520
Shriya got an introduction
to an expedition company:

374
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,160
"Utmost Adventure Trekking"
it's called.

375
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,960
They told Shriya as long as she was
determined, they'd teach her.

376
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,720
She had to be taught almost everything,
from putting crampons on her boots

377
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,160
to how to use them
to cross the ice ladders.

378
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,120
Agreeing to take such an obviously
unqualified climber up Mount Everest

379
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,920
could well be the Mount Everest
of irresponsible decisions.

380
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,840
While that woman
did make it to the summit,

381
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,240
she died
trying to make it back down.

382
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,400
Slow, inexperienced climbers
aren't just a danger to themselves,

383
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,600
they can be a danger
to everybody else.

384
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,680
The top of Everest
is just two Ping-Pong tables

385
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,320
and the route down is
sometimes single file.

386
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,080
If people aren't moving,
you can get stuck.

387
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,400
Listen as some experienced guides
worry about a client who's summited,

388
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,440
but who can't get down, because
people who probably shouldn't be there.

389
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,280
It should only take about 10 minutes
a person at the maximum.

390
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,080
I feel really sorry for Bill
and the guys up there.

391
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,320
Russ, we haven't moved.

392
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,120
Yeah, I know.

393
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,560
23 people queued up
on the second step.

394
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,760
The most pathetic sight
I can see

395
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,720
is the people who can't even down
climb a ladder one step at a time.

396
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,600
I'm sorry for the pathetic standard
of mountaineering in front of you

397
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,320
and I hope they can hear.

398
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,800
His frustration is understandable.
Think about the violent rage

399
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,080
you felt the last time
you couldn't walk down an escalator,

400
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,400
because assholes were standing still.

401
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,800
Now imagine doing that for hours,
in freezing temperatures,

402
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,240
as your brain leaks
down your spinal cord.

403
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,160
You'd be angry, too.

404
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,640
We're never going to get the number
of deaths on Everest down to zero.

405
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,760
There is inherent risk there.
Or at least, there will be

406
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,880
until one of the luxury expeditions
offers a bespoke catapult experience

407
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,360
in which clients are lobbed
in a private pressurized bubble.

408
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,120
But there are steps that Nepal
could take to manage the risks,

409
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,760
like reduce permits to
prevent overcrowding,

410
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,120
space out expeditions
and place limits

411
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,240
on the number of companies
that can operate...

412
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,640
Until Nepal does that, there will
continue to be deaths

413
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,560
that could have been prevented.

414
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,320
You question the motives
behind some of these climbs.

415
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,480
Even Sir Edmund Hillary was depressed
at what he had seen Everest become.

416
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,040
In these commercial expeditions

417
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,200
the guides work pretty hard
getting their customers up.

418
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,760
But all the customers want to try
and get to the top of the mountain

419
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,400
and then come down and boast
about it to their friends at home.

420
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,840
Very few of them,
and I've talked to many of them,

421
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,160
have a deep feeling
of love for the mountains.

422
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,280
Some aren't doing it out
of a passion for mountaineering,

423
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,360
but just because they want
to say they climbed Everest.

424
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,800
You think a selfie
from the summit of Makalu

425
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,560
is gonna get Everest-levels
of Instagram love ?

426
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,080
Of course not !
Who gives a shit about Makalu ?

427
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,800
It's only the ninth-tallest
mountain on earth.

428
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,880
Or rather, it would be,
if it existed, which it doesn't,

429
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,760
'cause I just made it up and none
of you noticed and that's the point.

430
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,720
Or, it would be,
if I had made it up.

431
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,240
Makalu is neither imaginary
nor the ninth-tallest mountain:

432
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,840
it's the fifth-tallest
and that's the point.

433
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,880
Or, rather, it would be,
if that were even Makalu.

434
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,400
That's the view from Everest
and you didn't notice

435
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,760
'cause the only thing most of us
know about mountain climbing

436
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,080
is that a selfie from the Everest

437
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,440
is fire because goals and thus
deserves some serious Insta-love

438
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,080
and that is the point here.

439
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,640
This points to a possible solution.
In researching this story,

440
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,800
we stumbled upon this tantalizing
attempt to secure bragging rights.

441
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,240
An Indian couple's accused
of faking a Everest climb.

442
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,680
A photo posted to the tour company's
website claimed to show

443
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,640
the woman at
the peak of Everest.

444
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,720
Another climber said this is a
Photoshopped picture of him.

445
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,080
They just Photoshopped
themselves up there.

446
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,480
That is the boldest
use of Photoshop to trick people

447
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,880
that I've seen, since I stumbled
across this sealpony hybrid.

448
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,960
It's amazing ! if you are going to put
yourself on top of Everest,

449
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,400
put yourself on a seal-pony,
it's just better !

450
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,520
The more you think about it,
the more brilliant this idea becomes.

451
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,920
If it is just a summit photo
that you want,

452
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,960
faking it is probably the most
ethically defensible way to get it.

453
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,720
If even faking it seems
like too much work to you,

454
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,160
we've created the company
"Adventures Indoors Luxepeditions",

455
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,600
the world leader in getting people
to the summit of Everest

456
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,280
without ever going there.

457
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,920
We believe that climbing Everest
should be for qualified climbers.

458
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,360
But that doesn't mean that you
can't visit the top of Everest.

459
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,080
Simply visit
TheTopOfMountEverest-dot-com,

460
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,720
a website
that was surprisingly available.

461
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,280
Once you are there,
you'll be asked:

462
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,640
"Would you like
to climb Mount Everest ?"

463
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,240
Simply click "Yes" and you can
then insert a picture of yourself,

464
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,040
either alone, with friends, or a pet,
onto the top of Everest,

465
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,760
all without posing any risk.

466
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,920
Our fatality rate is close to zero,

467
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,240
not too bad for the oldest Photoshop
expedition out there,

468
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,040
operational since Earlier
This Week 2019.

469
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,560
We know everyone wants
an arbitrary world record attached,

470
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,160
so you can also customize your
photo with your personal first,

471
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,960
like this one, of the first twin
babies to summit Everest.

472
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:10,000
Look at those fecal time bombs !
What an achievement.

473
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,280
What are you waiting for ?

474
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,240
Climbing Mount Everest has become
an industry with blood on its hands.

475
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,360
But it's one of the most striking
photos you can have of yourself.

476
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:28,040
Join me in embarking upon the Everest
of Instagrammable moments.

477
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:33,000
Visit TheTopOfMountEverest-dot-com.
Why do it ? Because it's there.

478
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,160
I'm going up. Shoo, Sherpa !
I'm doing it on my own.

479
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,600
I did this myself !
I did it on my own !

480
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,800
That's our show. Thanks for watching.
See you next week. Good night !

481
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,640
I did it !
Get out of here.

482
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,320
You're in frame.
Go get me a dining table.

483
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,920
I did it !
I'm on top of the world !

484
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,880
I'm the first British man with glasses
in a navy blue suit
