1
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:32,131
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

2
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,931
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

3
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:36,851
Just time for a quick
recap of the week.

4
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:40,051
Bernie Sanders announced
he's running for president again,

5
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:43,331
the odds of Paul Manafort dying
in prison increased considerably,

6
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:46,731
and the president is preparing
to appoint this man, William Happer,

7
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:50,052
to head up a climate change panel,
a man who has previously spoken

8
00:00:50,212 --> 00:00:52,892
of his love
of carbon dioxide, like this:

9
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,612
The demonization of carbon dioxide

10
00:00:55,772 --> 00:00:59,932
is just like the demonization
of the poor Jews under Hitler.

11
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:04,972
Carbon dioxide is, actually a benefit
to the world, and so were the Jews.

12
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,652
What are you talking about?

13
00:01:07,812 --> 00:01:11,412
I think the most damning part of a
sentence entirely made of damning parts

14
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,732
is "so <i>were the Jews."</i>

15
00:01:13,892 --> 00:01:16,172
He knows they still exist, right?

16
00:01:16,332 --> 00:01:19,212
Unless he also disputes the overwhelming
scientific consensus

17
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:22,772
published recently in the study,
"There are still Jews."

18
00:01:22,932 --> 00:01:24,492
Instead of going down
that wormhole,

19
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:26,773
I'd like to talk tonight
about North Carolina:

20
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:29,893
of the two Carolinas, without a doubt,
one of them.

21
00:01:30,053 --> 00:01:32,573
Now, this week,
there was a dramatic development

22
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:34,733
in the state's
Ninth Congressional District.

23
00:01:34,893 --> 00:01:37,653
<i>Ballot chaos--</i>
<i>a new election is ordered</i>

24
00:01:37,813 --> 00:01:40,493
<i>in that undecided congressional race</i>
<i>in North Carolina.</i>

25
00:01:40,653 --> 00:01:43,973
<i>Allegations of tampering and fraud</i>
<i>still surrounding the election</i>

26
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:47,013
<i>nearly four months</i>
<i>after voters went to the polls.</i>

27
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:50,333
It's true. Their election from last year
is still unsettled,

28
00:01:50,493 --> 00:01:52,173
and you shouldn't have
to wait so long

29
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,933
to find out something
that important.

30
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:55,773
I stopped watching
"The Masked Singer"

31
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:59,133
when I realized I'd have to wait
a week to find out who the Bee is.

32
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:01,774
Who's the Bee?
I don't even care,

33
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:04,014
and the wait is killing me.

34
00:02:04,174 --> 00:02:06,694
This story's incredible.
Back in November, it appeared

35
00:02:06,854 --> 00:02:10,774
that former Baptist pastor Mark Harris
had won the election by just 905 votes,

36
00:02:10,934 --> 00:02:13,974
and as you may have guessed
from his aggressive side part,

37
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,054
Harris is a piece of work.

38
00:02:16,214 --> 00:02:18,454
He's called Ted Cruz
his political hero,

39
00:02:18,614 --> 00:02:21,774
argued that the availability of abortion
leads to mass shootings,

40
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:24,934
and told the story of a pastor
who asked congregants to protest

41
00:02:25,094 --> 00:02:27,014
a certain ABC sitcom in the 1970s,

42
00:02:27,174 --> 00:02:29,134
and I'll let him pick up things
from there.

43
00:02:29,294 --> 00:02:32,694
It was gonna be about a guy
living with two girls,

44
00:02:32,854 --> 00:02:35,854
and the only way the landlord
was going to allow it to happen

45
00:02:36,015 --> 00:02:39,135
was the guy had to play
like he was a homosexual,

46
00:02:39,295 --> 00:02:40,615
he was gay.

47
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:44,135
He wasn't gay,
but he had to pretend to be,

48
00:02:44,295 --> 00:02:46,815
and that was the whole premise
of "Three's Company."

49
00:02:46,975 --> 00:02:49,895
Here's what Clyde Bearden said.

50
00:02:50,055 --> 00:02:52,775
He said, "The devil knows

51
00:02:52,935 --> 00:02:57,775
"that if they can get us
to laugh at it now,

52
00:02:57,935 --> 00:03:00,775
"we're only one generation away

53
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:04,055
"from being asked to accept it

54
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:07,935
as a purely alternative
lifestyle."

55
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:10,135
So let me get this straight, Mark.

56
00:03:10,295 --> 00:03:13,736
Satan was an ABC development executive
in the 1970s,

57
00:03:13,896 --> 00:03:17,376
and "Three's Company," a show with
no actual gay characters in it,

58
00:03:17,536 --> 00:03:19,616
was his project to destroy America.

59
00:03:19,776 --> 00:03:21,576
Are you absolutely sure
it wasn't a show

60
00:03:21,736 --> 00:03:24,256
about a glamorous nautical
fuck-palace

61
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:27,776
or the one about an illegal immigrant
made entirely out of cocaine?

62
00:03:27,936 --> 00:03:29,776
Are you sure about that?

63
00:03:29,936 --> 00:03:32,096
People soon began
questioning Harris' victory,

64
00:03:32,256 --> 00:03:34,296
particularly given
his disproportionate share

65
00:03:34,456 --> 00:03:36,976
of the mail-in absentee votes
in Bladen County.

66
00:03:37,136 --> 00:03:40,376
When authorities looked at his primary,
things got more suspicious,

67
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:44,696
because in that same county, he received
437 mail-in absentee votes,

68
00:03:44,856 --> 00:03:46,777
while his opponent,
Robert Pittenger,

69
00:03:46,937 --> 00:03:50,777
who happened to be the three-term
incumbent, got just 17,

70
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:52,457
and that is a red flag.

71
00:03:52,617 --> 00:03:55,377
It would only make sense
if Pittenger's campaign slogan

72
00:03:55,537 --> 00:03:58,977
was "Pittenger 2018:
Fuck Bladen County!"

73
00:03:59,137 --> 00:04:00,777
And as the suspicions grew,

74
00:04:00,937 --> 00:04:03,937
Harris' behavior
did not exactly dispel them.

75
00:04:04,097 --> 00:04:06,097
North Carolina candidate
Mark Harris

76
00:04:06,257 --> 00:04:09,537
chose to not speak to reporters tonight
after a GOP meeting

77
00:04:09,697 --> 00:04:11,377
next door
to the city council meeting,

78
00:04:11,537 --> 00:04:15,177
but the way he made his exit
had the whole building buzzing.

79
00:04:19,337 --> 00:04:23,018
<i>Harris set off the fire alarm on his way</i>
<i>out a back door into his car.</i>

80
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:27,058
<i>You can see Mark Harris running</i>
<i>across the street toward his car,</i>

81
00:04:27,218 --> 00:04:30,218
<i>taking off his jacket</i>
<i>and eventually driving away.</i>

82
00:04:30,378 --> 00:04:32,338
Holy shit.

83
00:04:32,498 --> 00:04:36,258
It's like watching the Beatles dart
through a backstage exit to outrun fans,

84
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:38,298
except instead
of "The Ed Sullivan Show,"

85
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,698
it's the Charlotte-Mecklenburg
government center,

86
00:04:40,858 --> 00:04:44,418
and instead of lovesick teenagers,
it's WBTV's David Hodges,

87
00:04:44,578 --> 00:04:47,938
and instead of the Beatles,
it's a 52-year-old minister named Mark,

88
00:04:48,098 --> 00:04:50,058
the equivalent of four Ringos.

89
00:04:50,218 --> 00:04:54,338
Now, suspicions soon centered around
a consultant that Harris had hired,

90
00:04:54,498 --> 00:04:55,818
Leslie McCrae Dowless,

91
00:04:55,978 --> 00:04:58,939
veteran political operative
and suburban Obi-Wan Kenobi,

92
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,779
and he'd previously admitted
under oath

93
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:05,459
that he had paid workers to collect
absentee ballots from voters in 2016,

94
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:06,939
which is a felony there.

95
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:09,979
Harris claims that he had no idea
Dowless might be a problem,

96
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,859
but this week, in a hearing
with the state election board,

97
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:14,739
Harris' own son testified that

98
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:17,779
he'd repeatedly and explicitly
warned his father.

99
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:19,779
Heard about this McCrae guy.

100
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:22,979
You know, seems to me like he may be
kind of a shady character.

101
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:25,779
I expressed my concerns,

102
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:29,019
based on everything that I did know
up to that point,

103
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:30,779
mainly my belief

104
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:35,180
that McCrae had engaged
in collecting ballots in 2016,

105
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,300
and I told him that collecting ballots
was a felony.

106
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,460
I thought what he was doing
was illegal, and I was right.

107
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,740
Wow. Most of us can only dream
about saying "I was right"

108
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,780
to our dads in an official setting.

109
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,980
This guy just lived that dream.

110
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,700
I only wish he'd brought up every other
instance of his dad being wrong.

111
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,740
"I was right about the garage door
opener, about the turnpike

112
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,900
"being the fastest way
to get to the movies,

113
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,900
"and I knew
that birds weren't mammals.

114
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,420
"They're birds, Dad.
Birds is its own thing.

115
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,460
"I fucking knew birds was its own thing,
and you didn't, Dad.

116
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,221
"Birds are birds, Dad.
Birds are birds."

117
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:14,381
And when asked why he'd ignored
all of his son's warnings,

118
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,821
Mark Harris' pushback
was not impressive.

119
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:18,301
I'm his dad,

120
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,821
and I know he's judg--
a little judgmental,

121
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:23,061
and has a little taste
of arrogance...

122
00:06:23,221 --> 00:06:26,541
Ooh, excuse me?
A taste of arrogance?

123
00:06:26,701 --> 00:06:29,581
It's an incredibly obnoxious thing
to say about your own son,

124
00:06:29,741 --> 00:06:32,981
but a perfect name for a restaurant
owned by Alec Baldwin.

125
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:35,461
It's--it's quite an experience.

126
00:06:35,621 --> 00:06:38,941
The waiter screams the menu at you,
and then punches you in the face.

127
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:41,221
You really must go.

128
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:42,741
As all this evidence piled up,

129
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:45,422
what was meant to be a one-day hearing
became four,

130
00:06:45,582 --> 00:06:47,462
and things got worse and worse
for Harris.

131
00:06:47,622 --> 00:06:51,742
On Thursday, his own lawyer interrupted
his testimony to ask for a recess,

132
00:06:51,902 --> 00:06:55,582
after which Harris did a complete
U-turn, claiming recent health problems

133
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:58,582
had impacted his ability
to recall events accurately,

134
00:06:58,742 --> 00:07:00,062
and saying this:

135
00:07:00,222 --> 00:07:02,782
It has become clear to me
that the public's confidence

136
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:05,782
in the Ninth District seat
general election

137
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:07,782
has been undermined to an extent

138
00:07:07,942 --> 00:07:09,622
that a new election is warranted.

139
00:07:09,782 --> 00:07:13,782
And that is the verbal equivalent
of running out an emergency exit

140
00:07:13,942 --> 00:07:15,862
and setting off a fire alarm,

141
00:07:16,022 --> 00:07:19,663
I'd love to keep making fun of this
story, but as Harris will tell you,

142
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:23,223
the danger is, if they can get us
to laugh at it now,

143
00:07:23,383 --> 00:07:24,983
we're just one generation away

144
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:27,543
from being asked to accept
committing election fraud

145
00:07:27,703 --> 00:07:30,623
as a purely alternative lifestyle.

146
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,543
And now, this:

147
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,423
<i>And now...</i>

148
00:07:39,223 --> 00:07:40,783
The two elderly men

149
00:07:40,943 --> 00:07:43,823
crashed their minivan
on their way to the local fair

150
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:47,623
The driver, 83-year-old
James Billingsley...

151
00:07:47,783 --> 00:07:49,943
AKA "Dimples the Clown"...

152
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,463
<i>Their water has been shut off</i>

153
00:07:51,623 --> 00:07:53,543
<i>because the state</i>
<i>can't pay the bill.</i>

154
00:07:53,703 --> 00:07:57,024
<i>IDOT says it's because</i>
<i>there's no state bu--</i>

155
00:07:57,184 --> 00:07:58,504
<i>No state budget.</i>

156
00:07:58,664 --> 00:08:00,024
<i>The FSU quarterback</i>

157
00:08:00,184 --> 00:08:02,304
<i>will not play in the Peach Bowl</i>

158
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:04,784
<i>because of a family issue.</i>

159
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:06,864
Death in the family
is the rumor, Thomas.

160
00:08:07,024 --> 00:08:09,104
Certainly is.
You gotta love that, though?

161
00:08:09,264 --> 00:08:12,264
Investigators believe a bomb caused
the explosion on the plane,

162
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:15,304
which had taken off from the Somali
capital of Mogadishu.

163
00:08:15,464 --> 00:08:17,984
<i>The blast blew a hole</i>
<i>in the side of the plane,</i>

164
00:08:18,144 --> 00:08:21,264
<i>and one of the 74 passengers</i>
<i>on board was sucked out.</i>

165
00:08:21,424 --> 00:08:23,024
Christine Blasey Ford

166
00:08:23,184 --> 00:08:24,584
testified

167
00:08:24,744 --> 00:08:26,584
she was sexually assaulted.

168
00:08:26,744 --> 00:08:29,304
- We can't laugh.
- Sorry.

169
00:08:30,825 --> 00:08:34,265
Moving on, our main story tonight
concerns psychics,

170
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:37,745
the only people with more misplaced
confidence than Michael Avenatti.

171
00:08:37,905 --> 00:08:41,385
You probably haven't thought about
psychics in a while, which is weird--

172
00:08:41,545 --> 00:08:42,945
there's not much else going on--

173
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,345
but if you watch daytime TV at all,

174
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:48,185
you'll see that they pop up
all the time.

175
00:08:48,345 --> 00:08:51,985
My next guest started communicating with
the dead when she was a toddler.

176
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:55,865
She's a wife and a mom who also happens
to talk to dead people.

177
00:08:56,025 --> 00:08:57,705
Please welcome
celebrity pet psychic--

178
00:08:57,865 --> 00:09:00,065
Our next guest
is a clairvoyant to the stars.

179
00:09:00,225 --> 00:09:03,585
We're back with a group of friends
who share a very unique bond:

180
00:09:03,745 --> 00:09:05,266
they are all psychic.

181
00:09:05,426 --> 00:09:08,786
It's good that at least Dr. Oz
isn't wearing scrubs in that clip,

182
00:09:08,946 --> 00:09:10,386
but I'd still like him to do more

183
00:09:10,546 --> 00:09:13,226
to signal he lacks credibility
as a medical professional.

184
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,466
A sandwich sign
that says "Walking Joke"

185
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:17,786
is the clothing choice
I'd be comfortable with.

186
00:09:17,946 --> 00:09:20,946
Before we go any further,
I am not going to be litigating

187
00:09:21,106 --> 00:09:22,746
whether psychics are real or not.

188
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:27,146
For one, they're not.
See? No litigation required.

189
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:29,786
Also, for anyone who does believe
in psychic powers,

190
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:32,586
I know nothing I could say
would convince you otherwise.

191
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:36,226
Logic isn't the reason you believe,
and it won't be the reason you stop,

192
00:09:36,386 --> 00:09:40,147
which is not to say I won't be showing
clips of psychics fucking up,

193
00:09:40,307 --> 00:09:43,267
but that is only because
it's really funny.

194
00:09:43,427 --> 00:09:47,627
This is a girl who you said

195
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:51,467
was beaten and killed.

196
00:09:51,627 --> 00:09:54,787
- Okay.
- This little girl is me...

197
00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:59,587
And you told somebody
that she's dead.

198
00:09:59,747 --> 00:10:01,147
Wait a minute.

199
00:10:01,307 --> 00:10:03,067
You didn't disappear?

200
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:06,467
- I'm right here.
- Well, that's interesting, isn't it?

201
00:10:06,627 --> 00:10:08,707
Yeah, that is interesting.

202
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:10,867
I guess her psychic abilities
didn't include

203
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,307
predicting when she'd be humiliated
on national television.

204
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:17,588
And look, it is easy to dismiss
psychics as a joke.

205
00:10:17,748 --> 00:10:19,188
Really easy.
Fun, too.

206
00:10:19,348 --> 00:10:20,948
But the fact of the matter is,

207
00:10:21,108 --> 00:10:24,668
one recent poll found four in ten
Americans believe in psychics.

208
00:10:24,828 --> 00:10:27,548
Think about it.
Statistically, out of all the people

209
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:31,588
who saw John Travolta's "Gotti" movie,
four of them believe in psychics,

210
00:10:31,748 --> 00:10:35,788
so whether they are real
or not is incidental.

211
00:10:35,948 --> 00:10:38,668
What matters is a lot of people
think they are,

212
00:10:38,828 --> 00:10:41,908
and the psychic industry is larger
and grimmer than you assume.

213
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:45,148
By one estimate,
it's a $2.2 billion industry,

214
00:10:45,308 --> 00:10:47,788
and there has been a lot
of predatory behavior.

215
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,468
When the FDC settled charges

216
00:10:49,628 --> 00:10:52,589
with the companies behind
the Psychic Readers Network in 2002,

217
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:54,189
the one that featured Miss Cleo,

218
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:56,789
they found that
over one three-year period,

219
00:10:56,949 --> 00:11:01,429
they had charged people about $1 billion
and had collected half of it.

220
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:04,189
They took in $500 million.

221
00:11:04,349 --> 00:11:07,149
I had no idea
psychics could make that much money.

222
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:10,789
It's like finding out the second-richest
person behind Jeff Bezos,

223
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:13,749
is this GameStop employee
named Greg.

224
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:17,469
I mean, good for Greg, I guess,
but now I've got a lot of questions

225
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:20,789
about GameStop
and literally everything else.

226
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:23,789
So tonight, let's take a look
at the psychic industry,

227
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:27,430
particularly one of the most insidious
parts of it: mediums,

228
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,990
who claim to be able
to communicate with the dead.

229
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,790
They are everywhere on TV.

230
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,030
Some even have
their own reality shows.

231
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,590
<i>She's a professional psychic.</i>

232
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,950
It's me, Mary O.
<i>Madonna mia!</i>

233
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,430
<i>"Mary Knows Best."</i>

234
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,110
<i>"Hollywood Medium," on E!.</i>

235
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,110
<i>"Psychic Tia" on A&E.</i>

236
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,910
<i>"Mama Medium,"</i>
<i>November 5th at 9:00 on TLC.</i>

237
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:50,550
Spirit is important to me, just as
important as my hair and my nails.

238
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,070
<i>"Long Island Medium," only on TLC.</i>

239
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,030
The crazy thing about these shows

240
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,350
is how they choose to focus
on the psychics' personal lives.

241
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,350
Who gives a shit about that?

242
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:03,871
If I believed they could communicate
with the dead,

243
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:06,191
it's the only thing
I'd want to see them doing.

244
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,671
The Long Island medium
can ask Abraham Lincoln,

245
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,791
Gandhi, and Shakespeare
anything she wants,

246
00:12:10,951 --> 00:12:14,591
so tune in next week,
as she thinks about getting bangs.

247
00:12:14,751 --> 00:12:16,951
And look, I will admit

248
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,951
mediums make for compelling TV.

249
00:12:19,111 --> 00:12:22,191
Most people have seen at least one
bring someone to tears

250
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:24,751
with messages from dead loved ones
like this:

251
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:28,991
Did you lose your husband, ma'am?
Your husband wants to thank you

252
00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:32,671
for caring for him and for allowing him
to leave the physical world

253
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:34,431
with dignity and grace.

254
00:12:36,271 --> 00:12:40,472
That woman is clearly genuinely touched,
although I will say that it is weird

255
00:12:40,632 --> 00:12:44,312
that the conduit to the afterlife
is, for some reason, Theresa Caputo,

256
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:48,792
proof of what would happen if you added
too much baking soda to Edie Falco.

257
00:12:48,952 --> 00:12:53,752
And while watching people tear up
can seem incredible,

258
00:12:53,912 --> 00:12:56,352
the techniques that psychics use
to achieve that

259
00:12:56,512 --> 00:12:58,352
are significantly less incredible,

260
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:01,552
'cause there are two basic techniques
that psychics tend to use.

261
00:13:01,712 --> 00:13:03,152
The first is called cold reading.

262
00:13:03,312 --> 00:13:05,392
It's basically taking
high-probability guesses

263
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:08,912
like "I'm sensing a loved one
who had problems in the chest area,"

264
00:13:09,072 --> 00:13:11,792
or "Is there a J or an M
in a loved one's name?"

265
00:13:11,952 --> 00:13:14,353
Here is some cold reading in action.

266
00:13:14,513 --> 00:13:17,073
All right,

267
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:19,673
and is there a D-- like a Daniel?

268
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,753
David? Like, there's a big D,
so for me, it's initials,

269
00:13:22,913 --> 00:13:25,593
it's months of the year,
like December being important...

270
00:13:25,753 --> 00:13:28,113
Who is the M-R name?
Mark? Mary? Marie?

271
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:30,513
They don't have to be passed.
They could be here.

272
00:13:30,673 --> 00:13:34,273
Either Maureen, Mary Anne-- there's
an M name. Where's the M connection?

273
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:37,433
Does someone have a scar
on the b--on the foot?

274
00:13:37,593 --> 00:13:39,593
- I do.
- Thank you, your daddy's telling me

275
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:41,073
there's a scar on your foot.

276
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:45,433
She departed of Alzheimer's, some type
of dementia, something of the brain,

277
00:13:45,593 --> 00:13:48,394
and you had to make decisions
connected to her departure.

278
00:13:48,554 --> 00:13:51,674
Did anybody have either a brain tumor,
brain aneurysm,

279
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,994
or a cerebral hemorrhage?

280
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,074
Not connected to him?
Not connected to you.

281
00:13:58,234 --> 00:13:59,954
Somebody behind you had that.

282
00:14:00,114 --> 00:14:03,234
Oh. Someone behind her had that.

283
00:14:03,394 --> 00:14:04,994
Nice save, buddy!

284
00:14:05,154 --> 00:14:08,514
It often turns out that a psychic's
wrong guess is just energy

285
00:14:08,674 --> 00:14:10,474
from somewhere else in the room,

286
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:12,834
a room that's very likely
to have someone

287
00:14:12,994 --> 00:14:16,594
with one of the problems he listed,
because cerebrovascular diseases

288
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:19,474
are the fifth-leading cause
of death in the United States.

289
00:14:19,634 --> 00:14:21,874
It's like asking a room
full of praying mantises,

290
00:14:22,034 --> 00:14:25,195
"Has anybody here lost a loved one
'cause you ate them after sex?"

291
00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:30,275
You know all those little green hands
are going up.

292
00:14:30,435 --> 00:14:33,275
The secret of cold reading
is the broader the generality,

293
00:14:33,435 --> 00:14:35,315
the more it could resonate with someone.

294
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,315
It's the same reason
that fortune cookies

295
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:39,915
predict "romantic developments
ahead" and not

296
00:14:40,075 --> 00:14:42,595
"Your wife will seem icy
around the 12th of the month,

297
00:14:42,755 --> 00:14:45,715
"because when she asked you
to handle the grout in the shower,

298
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:49,955
"she didn't mean, 'keep her abreast
of every step of the grouting process.'

299
00:14:50,115 --> 00:14:51,555
"She wanted it off her plate,

300
00:14:51,715 --> 00:14:54,795
"and texts during the workday
asking if she thinks the landlord

301
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:57,835
"will ask for plumber's insurance--
that's not off her plate.

302
00:14:57,995 --> 00:15:00,636
"That's you filling up the plate
instead of the plumber.

303
00:15:00,796 --> 00:15:02,116
"Does that make sense, Aaron?

304
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,916
"It's like the garbage disposal
installation again!

305
00:15:05,076 --> 00:15:08,116
Lucky numbers 8, 14, and 23."

306
00:15:08,276 --> 00:15:09,596
And sometimes,

307
00:15:09,756 --> 00:15:12,036
psychics may make
laughably sure bets.

308
00:15:12,196 --> 00:15:15,116
For instance, here's John Edward,
in Huntington, Long Island,

309
00:15:15,276 --> 00:15:18,916
a town where nearly one in five
residents are of Irish ancestry.

310
00:15:19,076 --> 00:15:22,716
Is there a Brian Flanagan
or a O'Flynn

311
00:15:22,876 --> 00:15:24,516
or O'Sullivan

312
00:15:24,676 --> 00:15:25,996
or Reilly

313
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:30,076
or some type of...
who's passed?

314
00:15:30,236 --> 00:15:32,876
Brian O' something?
Flanagan, Sullivan, like that?

315
00:15:33,036 --> 00:15:35,357
What are you doing?

316
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,997
"Brian O'Flanagan
or O'Flynn or O' something"--

317
00:15:38,157 --> 00:15:40,877
you're supposed to be speaking
to people's dead relatives,

318
00:15:41,037 --> 00:15:43,997
not trying to guess the name
of the Lucky Charms mascot.

319
00:15:44,157 --> 00:15:46,957
And for the record,
that leprechaun's name:

320
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:55,037
If that surprises you, maybe update
your antiquated Irish stereotypes.

321
00:15:55,197 --> 00:15:58,037
Once a psychic has you on the hook,
they use your responses,

322
00:15:58,197 --> 00:16:00,437
as well as nonverbal cues
you may be giving them,

323
00:16:00,597 --> 00:16:02,357
to make narrower
and narrower guesses

324
00:16:02,517 --> 00:16:04,357
until you're amazed
at what they've done.

325
00:16:04,517 --> 00:16:08,117
Of course, it's not an exact science--
it's not a science at all--

326
00:16:08,277 --> 00:16:09,798
and sometimes, things do go wrong.

327
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,798
Let's pick up
John Edward's reading

328
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:15,918
with the family of Brian O' something,
as he doubles down on a bad guess.

329
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,398
I'm kind of getting the feeling
of not liking the older female.

330
00:16:20,558 --> 00:16:24,118
Like, not liking the mother figure,
so if you tell me you didn't like--

331
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:26,718
his father's mother,
I would understand that.

332
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:33,238
- No, you've got the wrong Brian, then.
- I don't think I do.

333
00:16:34,838 --> 00:16:37,958
I don't think so.
I can't tell you what you want to hear.

334
00:16:38,118 --> 00:16:41,798
Only what they're showing me. If he's
calling your mom a bitch, I'll say it.

335
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:46,839
Oh, my God. Now, look, say what you want
about John Edward.

336
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:49,199
He's sticking to his guns there.
None of that,

337
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:53,159
"maybe this bitch energy is coming from
somewhere else in the room" this time.

338
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:55,359
No, this time,
he chooses to go for it.

339
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,679
"Brian thinks Grandma's a bitch,
and you know what? So do I now.

340
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:01,319
"In fact, hang on.
Amelia Earhart just came through,

341
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,039
"and she called Grandma the C-word,

342
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,479
"so don't be mad with me,
be mad at Amelia Earhart."

343
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:11,439
Cold reading is basically a magic trick,
and yet prominent, smart people

344
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,679
are willing to co-sign
on psychic's abilities.

345
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,679
A few years ago, Tyler Henry,
the Hollywood medium

346
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,919
and anime drawing of Jared Kushner,

347
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,080
went on the Today Show to do a reading
of one of their anchors,

348
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,840
and I'm afraid that it's
the exact "Today" show anchor

349
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,880
that you are hoping-
slash-dreading it is.

350
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,720
There's a reference to fishing,

351
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,400
but he's talking
about being spoken out loud to.

352
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,200
I know what this is, actually.

353
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,240
I don't know if you're aware of this,
but he is acknowledging

354
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,280
an individual be out on a boat

355
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,480
and I feel like I'm sitting alone and
I'm fishing, and I'm thinking, "Dad,"

356
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,000
and... he's having me acknowledge
this feeling

357
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,000
of, like, "I'm there with you."

358
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,200
You know, my dad
shared two passions with me.

359
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,800
He shared golf and fishing.

360
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,521
<i>- Nice.</i>
<i>- And, I do go out</i>

361
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:57,921
and fish a lot alone on a boat,

362
00:17:58,081 --> 00:17:59,801
and this idea that--

363
00:17:59,961 --> 00:18:01,801
that that might be a time

364
00:18:01,961 --> 00:18:03,401
to communicate with him

365
00:18:03,561 --> 00:18:05,801
or that he is attempting
to communicate...

366
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:09,161
- Yeah.
- Is... Is phenomenal to me.

367
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,961
Yeah, phenomenal.

368
00:18:11,121 --> 00:18:13,601
It's clear that Matt Lauer is touched,
and this time,

369
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:16,401
he didn't have to pressure a subordinate
into doing it.

370
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:18,601
And now look, look, maybe,

371
00:18:18,761 --> 00:18:22,401
Tyler Henry just took a shot
that an older, straight, white male

372
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:25,081
was upwards of lukewarm
toward fishing.

373
00:18:25,241 --> 00:18:27,441
If he did,
that would be cold reading,

374
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:30,562
but he may be using the other technique,
of hot reading,

375
00:18:30,722 --> 00:18:32,962
which involves doing
prior research on a subject.

376
00:18:33,122 --> 00:18:37,202
He could've read articles where Lauer
talks of his dad's passion for fishing,

377
00:18:37,362 --> 00:18:40,282
or seen interviews
that Lauer gave, like this one.

378
00:18:40,442 --> 00:18:43,322
My dad taught me how to fish.
When I stand in a trout stream,

379
00:18:43,482 --> 00:18:46,842
with the waders on and the fly rod
in my hand or I'm fishing for bass,

380
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:49,002
I think about sitting
in a boat with my dad.

381
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:52,802
Look, maybe Tyler Henry
genuinely accessed the afterlife,

382
00:18:52,962 --> 00:18:56,602
which would fundamentally change our
understanding of everything on Earth,

383
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:59,482
or maybe he just Googled
"Matt Lauer dad"

384
00:18:59,642 --> 00:19:01,522
and hit the fucking jackpot.

385
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,002
So--so to recap,

386
00:19:03,162 --> 00:19:05,402
hot reading, researching people
beforehand,

387
00:19:05,563 --> 00:19:07,643
the even lazier skill
than cold reading,

388
00:19:07,803 --> 00:19:09,563
which involves
indiscriminately shouting

389
00:19:09,723 --> 00:19:12,243
the names of dead Irishmen
in a hotel ballroom.

390
00:19:12,403 --> 00:19:15,803
And what's surprising is,
whichever technique Tyler used,

391
00:19:15,963 --> 00:19:18,443
Lauer fell for it,
and he is smart.

392
00:19:18,603 --> 00:19:21,243
He's a sophisticated
Manhattan sex monster,

393
00:19:21,403 --> 00:19:24,123
but--but he fell for it, hard,

394
00:19:24,283 --> 00:19:26,963
so hard he wanted to make it clear
to the viewers at home

395
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:30,563
that this was way more
than just your standard TV bullshit.

396
00:19:30,723 --> 00:19:33,963
I tell you, I got home, I cried.
I did plenty of crying.

397
00:19:34,123 --> 00:19:36,683
- It's amazing.
- We wanna let you know,

398
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,083
season two of "Hollywood Medium
with Tyler Hen--"

399
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:41,644
<i>it almost seems weird to be doing it</i>
<i>as a promo now,</i>

400
00:19:41,804 --> 00:19:44,844
because it was so much more important
to me than a promo--

401
00:19:45,004 --> 00:19:48,404
it premieres Wednesday, August 10th,
on our sister network, E!

402
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:52,164
Everything about that is a bit strange,
not least the fact that it's weird

403
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,924
to envision a scenario where something
happened at the Today show offices

404
00:19:56,084 --> 00:19:58,644
and Matt Lauer was the one
who went home and cried,

405
00:19:58,804 --> 00:20:00,284
and, look, look,

406
00:20:00,444 --> 00:20:01,804
you can see

407
00:20:01,964 --> 00:20:04,724
why people are vulnerable
to psychics.

408
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:08,324
A message from a lost loved one
is something many grieving people

409
00:20:08,484 --> 00:20:11,604
would do anything for,
and psychics may tell themselves

410
00:20:11,764 --> 00:20:14,084
that they offer a harmless way
to deal with loss.

411
00:20:14,244 --> 00:20:17,365
Just watch as Theresa Caputo
pretty much spells that out

412
00:20:17,525 --> 00:20:19,685
in response
to a fairly obvious question.

413
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:23,005
So when a tragedy happens--
let's say a murder.

414
00:20:23,165 --> 00:20:25,485
- Yeah.
- If somebody comes to a loved one

415
00:20:25,645 --> 00:20:30,085
and the spirit of the person
who was murdered is there,

416
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:33,245
could that spirit potentially tell you
who did it?

417
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:34,805
They will acknowledge

418
00:20:34,965 --> 00:20:37,165
maybe the relationship,

419
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:39,645
but never will call someone out
on a name.

420
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,565
- Why is that?
- My thing--how I use my gift

421
00:20:42,725 --> 00:20:46,285
is I only want messages that will help
someone for the healing process.

422
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:50,925
Oh, come on! First, to be clear,
if I was murdered,

423
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:54,526
I would definitely name names
as a ghost.

424
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:58,926
It's not like one of the rules in heaven
is "ghost snitches get ghost stitches."

425
00:20:59,086 --> 00:21:02,646
As we all know, the only rule in heaven
is "no fucking the clouds."

426
00:21:02,806 --> 00:21:04,606
Seriously, it's a real problem
up there,

427
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:07,806
and to be fair, I get it.
They're so fluffy!

428
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,766
And you might say at this point,

429
00:21:09,926 --> 00:21:11,646
"Hold on.
Where is the downside

430
00:21:11,806 --> 00:21:14,006
in telling people
their grandmother loved them,"

431
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,006
but I would argue that at best,
it is reckless

432
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:20,126
for a stranger to take a stab
at ventriloquizing the dead.

433
00:21:20,286 --> 00:21:23,606
Loss is complicated, and mourning
doesn't look the same for everyone.

434
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:26,927
But at worst, when psychic abilities
are presented as authentic,

435
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:31,207
it emboldens a vast underworld
of unscrupulous vultures

436
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:34,447
happy to make money by offering
an open line to the afterlife,

437
00:21:34,607 --> 00:21:36,807
as well as
many other bullshit services.

438
00:21:36,967 --> 00:21:39,807
Take Rose Marks.
She ran a lucrative psychic ring,

439
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:44,367
and in 2014, went to prison for
defrauding clients of over $17 million,

440
00:21:44,527 --> 00:21:47,327
much of which came from best-selling
author Jude Deveraux,

441
00:21:47,487 --> 00:21:50,807
who Marks had promised
to reconnect with her dead son,

442
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:53,207
and the sick thing is,
parents in crisis

443
00:21:53,367 --> 00:21:56,327
are frequently
actively targeted by psychics

444
00:21:56,487 --> 00:21:58,527
at their most desperate moments.

445
00:21:58,687 --> 00:22:01,007
<i>John and Jo Ann Lowitzer</i>
<i>have been searching</i>

446
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:05,088
<i>for their 17-year-old daughter,</i>
<i>Ali, since she vanished last year,</i>

447
00:22:05,248 --> 00:22:07,688
<i>but when the case</i>
<i>made national news...</i>

448
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:12,248
<i>The Houston parents say</i>
<i>they became inundated with calls</i>

449
00:22:12,408 --> 00:22:14,768
<i>from so-called psychic detectives.</i>

450
00:22:14,928 --> 00:22:17,768
<i>They say some even showed up</i>
<i>at their front door,</i>

451
00:22:17,928 --> 00:22:21,448
<i>promising their psychic visions</i>
<i>could help bring Ali home.</i>

452
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:24,288
He guaranteed me that he'd find Ali
in three days.

453
00:22:24,448 --> 00:22:26,608
I mean, what parent
wouldn't be excited

454
00:22:26,768 --> 00:22:29,888
<i>to hear you're gonna have</i>
<i>your daughter home in three days?</i>

455
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,928
That is absolutely horrible.

456
00:22:32,088 --> 00:22:34,408
The last thing
any parent needs in that situation

457
00:22:34,568 --> 00:22:37,248
is having to fend off
an attention-seeking parasite

458
00:22:37,408 --> 00:22:40,889
who feeds off personal tragedy
like a human-sized deer tick,

459
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:44,809
and the problem is, TV actively enables
that ghoulishness.

460
00:22:44,969 --> 00:22:47,409
"The Montel Williams Show"
featured Sylvia Browne,

461
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:51,889
a known psychic who advised parents with
missing children on how to locate them.

462
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:54,609
On one episode, she advised
the mother of Amanda Berry,

463
00:22:54,769 --> 00:22:56,489
a missing child
who had been kidnapped.

464
00:22:56,649 --> 00:23:01,009
Amanda was actually alive and watching
that episode from captivity,

465
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:02,929
and after she eventually escaped,

466
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:05,529
she talked
about how watching it had felt.

467
00:23:05,689 --> 00:23:07,809
<i>I'd watch her</i>
<i>every time she was on Montel,</i>

468
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,809
and wish my mom would go on there,
and she could tell my mom

469
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:12,569
that I was alive and that I'm okay.

470
00:23:12,729 --> 00:23:14,330
- She's--
<i>- But Sylvia Browne</i>

471
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,810
<i>breaks Louwana's hope.</i>

472
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,850
I just hate this.
She's not alive, honey.

473
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,290
I just broke down, crying,
I couldn't believe she said that,

474
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,050
<i>and then my mom broke down, crying,</i>

475
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,730
<i>so that hurt even worse.</i>

476
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,730
That is heartbreaking,

477
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:33,050
and Sylvia Browne is clearly
an awful person for doing that,

478
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:36,250
but I would argue that Montel
also bears some blame

479
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,330
for giving Browne a platform
to begin with.

480
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:41,330
Put it this way. If Oprah interviewed
a live alligator

481
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,370
and it ate four members
of her audience,

482
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:48,170
I'd be angry with the alligator, but
I'd also be kind of angry with Oprah.

483
00:23:48,331 --> 00:23:51,851
Sylvia Browne actually died
a few years ago, or did she?

484
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:54,571
People have been wrong
about that sort of thing before.

485
00:23:54,731 --> 00:23:57,691
Maybe she's alive, and watching me
refer to her as dead.

486
00:23:57,851 --> 00:24:02,651
The one thing I know for sure is that
Montel's show is definitely deceased,

487
00:24:02,811 --> 00:24:07,731
but--but daytime shows
are still holding hands with this shit.

488
00:24:07,891 --> 00:24:10,931
Just last month, Dr. Phil
had a psychic detective on

489
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:12,811
to help solve a cold case,

490
00:24:12,971 --> 00:24:14,531
and why would he do that?

491
00:24:14,691 --> 00:24:18,211
The only logical explanation for letting
a professional guesser weigh in

492
00:24:18,371 --> 00:24:20,851
would be if Dr. Phil
was actually the murderer

493
00:24:21,011 --> 00:24:23,051
and was trying
to throw people off the scent,

494
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,812
but apart from that explanation,
that now makes sense,

495
00:24:25,972 --> 00:24:29,212
there is no explanation,
although I will say this.

496
00:24:29,372 --> 00:24:31,732
Every now and then,
when handled responsibly,

497
00:24:31,892 --> 00:24:34,612
a psychic on television
is a delightful thing.

498
00:24:34,772 --> 00:24:36,932
Watch this spectacular
local news investigation

499
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:40,812
of a psychic named Debra Dominque,
who, in exchange for $160,

500
00:24:40,972 --> 00:24:43,532
met an undercover reporter
at a Denny's.

501
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:45,452
<i>Our producer met her</i>
<i>at a coffee shop,</i>

502
00:24:45,612 --> 00:24:47,932
<i>saying she wants to know</i>
<i>what happened to Matthew,</i>

503
00:24:48,092 --> 00:24:51,692
<i>the 10-year-old boy in this photo.</i>

504
00:24:51,852 --> 00:24:53,572
It's so tragic.

505
00:24:53,732 --> 00:24:57,012
<i>After staring at his photo,</i>
<i>she uses a special pendulum,</i>

506
00:24:57,172 --> 00:25:00,453
<i>claiming it allows her</i>
<i>to talk with the dead.</i>

507
00:25:00,613 --> 00:25:02,373
They're saying
he's not alive anymore.

508
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:06,173
<i>And then she claims she has connected</i>
<i>directly with Matthew.</i>

509
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:13,173
<i>But is he? Because we're pretty sure</i>
<i>Matthew, the boy in this photo,</i>

510
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:15,733
<i>is not wearing white or in heaven.</i>

511
00:25:15,893 --> 00:25:19,453
<i>In fact, we know he's wearing black,</i>
<i>and is alive,</i>

512
00:25:19,613 --> 00:25:23,253
<i>because you're looking at him</i>
<i>sitting in the booth right behind her.</i>

513
00:25:23,413 --> 00:25:24,893
Yep.

514
00:25:25,053 --> 00:25:27,573
That boy is indeed
in the opposite of heaven.

515
00:25:27,733 --> 00:25:29,453
He's in a Denny's.

516
00:25:30,973 --> 00:25:34,774
But wait. Wait till you see
exactly how they bust her,

517
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:36,934
because it is just perfect.

518
00:25:37,094 --> 00:25:40,014
- Kurtis Ming, Channel 13. How are you?
- I'm fine.

519
00:25:40,174 --> 00:25:41,734
<i>Showing her</i>
<i>the picture of Matthew,</i>

520
00:25:41,894 --> 00:25:43,854
<i>she tells me</i>
<i>she thinks he was taken.</i>

521
00:25:44,014 --> 00:25:46,654
I understand you said
you thought he was deceased.

522
00:25:46,814 --> 00:25:50,654
- Yes, I believe he could be.
- I've got news for you.

523
00:25:50,814 --> 00:25:54,014
It might come as a shock,
but he's very much alive.

524
00:25:54,174 --> 00:25:56,694
- Oh, that's great.
- And he's actually standing

525
00:25:56,854 --> 00:25:58,574
right behind you right now.

526
00:25:58,734 --> 00:26:00,254
Oh, boy.

527
00:26:00,414 --> 00:26:02,774
That's great.
That's great.

528
00:26:02,934 --> 00:26:04,334
It is great.

529
00:26:04,494 --> 00:26:08,294
It is great. It's utter perfection.
The only way that could have been better

530
00:26:08,454 --> 00:26:12,095
is if the first thing that kid said
to her was "Hey, Mom,"

531
00:26:12,255 --> 00:26:15,135
and I would argue that that
is the only responsible way

532
00:26:15,295 --> 00:26:16,975
to put a psychic on television:

533
00:26:17,135 --> 00:26:20,415
humiliating them with a ghost boy
in a Denny's parking lot,

534
00:26:20,575 --> 00:26:23,935
because this surprisingly large,
often predatory industry

535
00:26:24,095 --> 00:26:27,695
relies on popular culture
to lend it credence and validity.

536
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:32,575
To put it another way, every time
a psychic makes a widow cry on "Dr. Oz,"

537
00:26:32,735 --> 00:26:34,815
ten con artists get their wings,

538
00:26:34,975 --> 00:26:38,335
and that is a problem,
because there will always be people

539
00:26:38,495 --> 00:26:41,855
who feel an urge to reach out
to psychics in their time of need,

540
00:26:42,015 --> 00:26:44,615
so if you or someone you know
is one of them,

541
00:26:44,775 --> 00:26:46,816
I may have a small way to help here.

542
00:26:46,976 --> 00:26:49,936
But this isn't the best format
for me to show you, so please,

543
00:26:50,096 --> 00:26:53,256
join me on the set of my new
daytime talk show instead.

544
00:26:59,136 --> 00:27:01,296
Welcome back to "Wakey Wakey
with John Oliver."

545
00:27:01,456 --> 00:27:03,936
It's sometime between 9:00
and 3:00 in the afternoon,

546
00:27:04,096 --> 00:27:07,016
and my next guest
is a Staten Island psychic

547
00:27:07,176 --> 00:27:08,496
and author of the book,

548
00:27:08,656 --> 00:27:10,736
"These Freaking Spirits,
Lemme Tell Ya."

549
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:13,536
Please welcome Wanda Jo Oliver.

550
00:27:13,696 --> 00:27:15,336
Thank you.

551
00:27:15,496 --> 00:27:18,776
Thank you.
Thank you.

552
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:21,497
Thank you for having me, John.
Thank you.

553
00:27:21,657 --> 00:27:24,617
It's lovely to have you.
If you look familiar to some viewers,

554
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:27,337
it might be because
you're also my beloved wife.

555
00:27:27,497 --> 00:27:31,097
- Yeah. I'm his freaking angel.
- She is, she is.

556
00:27:31,257 --> 00:27:33,817
Quick question, Wanda Jo.
What happened to your accent?

557
00:27:33,977 --> 00:27:36,937
- Aren't you from the South?
- I'm not from there anymore.

558
00:27:37,097 --> 00:27:40,377
That makes sense. Now, Wanda,
when did you first realize

559
00:27:40,537 --> 00:27:42,617
that you had
incredible psychic abilities?

560
00:27:42,777 --> 00:27:45,697
Oh, well, it was right after
I saw a thing on TV

561
00:27:45,857 --> 00:27:47,897
about how much money
psychics can make,

562
00:27:48,057 --> 00:27:51,457
and suddenly, I was like,
"Me, too!"

563
00:27:51,617 --> 00:27:53,217
"#MeToo."

564
00:27:53,377 --> 00:27:56,178
Oh, no. That's not--
that's actually a different thing.

565
00:27:56,338 --> 00:27:59,938
#MeToo. Anyway,
that's when I realized

566
00:28:00,098 --> 00:28:01,938
I had to share my gift
with the world.

567
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:05,378
Wanda Jo, I understand you've graciously
offered to give our viewers

568
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:08,338
-...psychic readings for free. Right?
-Bingo-bango.

569
00:28:08,498 --> 00:28:11,818
As part
of a court-ordered settlement,

570
00:28:11,978 --> 00:28:14,138
I've been forced
to set up a website.

571
00:28:16,978 --> 00:28:19,858
Just log on now, and you can get
a "freeading" from me,

572
00:28:20,018 --> 00:28:22,178
Wanda Jo, just like this.

573
00:28:22,338 --> 00:28:24,658
Okay, they want me
to acknowledge an M connection.

574
00:28:24,818 --> 00:28:26,898
That can mean Mark,
or Mary, or Megan.

575
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:30,818
It could be someone passed or alive.
It also doesn't have to be a name.

576
00:28:30,978 --> 00:28:34,139
Could be any word that starts with M
or has an M somewhere in it--

577
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:35,859
maybe "museum" or "hamper."

578
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:38,259
It could be an upside-down M,
like a W,

579
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:40,259
or a sideways M, like a 3 or an E.

580
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:44,419
Anyway, that person. He--or she--
wants me to tell you

581
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:48,819
that the time you had together
was really special to him-- or her.

582
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:51,619
Wow, that is phenomenal to me,

583
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:54,659
and it almost seems weird to be
doing this as a promo now,

584
00:28:54,819 --> 00:28:56,819
because Wanda gave me
a reading yesterday,

585
00:28:56,979 --> 00:28:58,819
and it was
so much more important to me

586
00:28:58,979 --> 00:29:01,419
than a promo.
I cried all the way home.

587
00:29:01,579 --> 00:29:02,899
Yeah.

588
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:06,339
I told him none of his dead relatives
wanted to talk to him.

589
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,980
That's so them.

590
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,100
The point is, go to Wanda Jo
the Free Psychic,

591
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,620
or mediumimpressive.com,
and get a free psychic reading.

592
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,940
We promise it will be
exactly as accurate

593
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,100
as any psychic reading
that you would pay money for.

594
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,860
Oh, wait. I'm getting a voice through
for someone at home. Hold on.

595
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,980
- Your grandmother's a bitch!
- Wow, okay.

596
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,820
That's our show.
Thanks for watching!

597
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,380
See you next week!
Good night!

598
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,740
You can't argue with that.
You can't argue with a spirit.

599
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,780
If they say "bitch," it's a bitch.

600
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,860
- They said she was a bitch.
- It's a bitch.

601
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,941
The book is fantastic.

602
00:29:42,101 --> 00:29:43,821
- Buy the book.
- Please buy the book.

603
00:29:43,981 --> 00:29:46,101
- Buy the book, please.
- Please buy the book.

604
00:29:46,261 --> 00:29:49,021
On all good bookshelves now.
