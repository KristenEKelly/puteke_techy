LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,960
SEASON VI
EPISODE 24

3
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,120
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !

4
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,880
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,280
We have to dive straight in to the news
that has been dominating this week.

6
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,600
I'm not talking about the fact that
Nicolas Cage will be starring in "Pig",

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,520
in which he plays a truffle hunter
who wants his pig back, which he is,

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,440
and it's all I want to talk about.

9
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,920
Instead we have to talk about this.

10
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,520
The whistleblower complaint sending
shock waves through Washington.

11
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,640
Troubling details about the president's
phone call with the leader of Ukraine.

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,120
During the call, Mr. Trump pressured
the Ukrainian president eight times

13
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,000
to investigate former Vice President
Joe Biden's son, Hunter.

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,080
Eight times !

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,080
It makes sense to ask for the same
thing 8 times in a single phone call

16
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,040
only if you're trying to connect with
a customer service agent for AT&T !

17
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,720
I got you, Business Daddy ! I got you !
You genuinely bad company !

18
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,240
But it is true: Trump is at the center
of another looming scandal.

19
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,200
He's accused of withholding nearly
$400 million in military aid to Ukraine

20
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,240
and then using it as leverage
to get dirt on Joe Biden.

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,280
It is very, very dumb.
And you might remember,

22
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,320
we called his Russia scandal
"Stupid Watergate".

23
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,440
Which means that we now have to work
out what this sequel should be called.

24
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,640
We considered "Stupid Watergate II:
Look Who's Stupid (The Same Guy)",

25
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,160
or "S2pid Watergate"
with "2" in the word "stupid",

26
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,560
or "STWOpid Watergate"
with "two" in the word "stupid".

27
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,320
But we settled on on this: "Stupid
Watergate II: The Stupidest Watergate."

28
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,600
And that one went fine
until the next one comes along.

29
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,520
Initially, the White House
denied any wrongdoing,

30
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,120
releasing their account
of the president's call,

31
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,800
claiming that it exonerated him.

32
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,040
Except, when you read the account,
it emphatically does not do that.

33
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,400
Trump asks for Biden to be investigated
and follows it by saying:

34
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,680
"I'll have Mr. Giuliani
give you a call,"

35
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,000
"I'm going to have
Attorney General Barr call"

36
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,600
"and we will get
to the bottom of it."

37
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,640
It's impressive how thorough
that abuse of power is.

38
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,720
He's looping in both
someone so involved in the government

39
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,000
they should be nowhere
near this kind of petty dirt,

40
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,000
and someone
so involved in petty dirt

41
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,240
they should be
nowhere near the government.

42
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,480
And it got even worse
the next morning,

43
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,800
when the whistleblower's complaint
was released,

44
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,840
which made it pretty clear
that after the phone call,

45
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,120
the White House worked extremely hard
to cover its tracks.

46
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,120
The whistleblower says senior White
House officials worked to lock down

47
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,760
all records of a presidential
phone call this summer

48
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,840
out of fear that they had witnessed
the president abuse his office

49
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,320
for personal gain.

50
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,040
It's true, the notes from the call
were stored in a separate,

51
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,000
code word-level system meant
for highly classified information,

52
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,960
despite the fact there was
no legitimate reason to do that.

53
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,400
And why do that if there wasn't
something very bad in there ?

54
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,480
If you don't want someone to see
something embarrassing on a computer,

55
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,360
you just put it in a folder
labeled "Finance Records."

56
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,960
I wouldn't do that, my finance records
folder is too full of finance records.

57
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,080
Wait ! No, don't open it !
Don't open it ! No !

58
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,240
Okay. Here's what that is !

59
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,600
Yes, you have found my collection
of hamsters in little Speedos !

60
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,600
It's not a sex thing !
That one is a bit of a sex thing.

61
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,800
But we don't have time
to get into it.

62
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,320
Every part of this new Stupid Watergate
is dumber than you can even imagine.

63
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,320
Even Ukraine's president,
Volodymyr Zelensky, is ridiculous.

64
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,240
He actually used to be a comedian,

65
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,720
at one point playing
the president of Ukraine in a sitcom.

66
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,880
Although, my favorite fact about him
is that one of his old comedy routines

67
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,640
was him and another guy pretending
to play the piano with... you'll see.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,880
Yeah, he played the piano
with his dick.

69
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,840
And just spare a thought
for the guy next to him,

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,560
who did that and somehow didn't
get elected president of Ukraine.

71
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,320
A few years later
he's stuck playing dick-music alone

72
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,720
at an open mic in the basement
of a Chinese restaurant.

73
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,280
Show business is cruel.

74
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,880
But even in a scandal full of absurd
figures, it is worth taking a moment

75
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,640
to appreciate the role played here
by Rudy Giuliani,

76
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,720
the New York City subway
of New York City mayors,

77
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,240
and a man who once
fucked his cousin.

78
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,920
Is that point strictly relevant ?

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,320
No. I would argue that, like Giuliani
and his first wife, it is not unrelated.

80
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,720
Perhaps the stupidest part
of Giuliani's involvement

81
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,680
is that he did this in plain sight.

82
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,040
He told "The New York Times"
"we are meddling in an investigation."

83
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,240
And he insists he did
absolutely nothing wrong.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Giuliani just did an interview
with "The Atlantic".

85
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,200
He seemed very angry
according to the reporter.

86
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,440
He said: "It is impossible that the
whistleblower is a hero and I'm not."

87
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,400
"And I will be the hero ! These morons,
when this is over, I will be the hero."

88
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,680
No you will not be.

89
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,040
And I'll tell you why, because
you will still be Rudy Giuliani.

90
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,760
Best case scenario here, you'll one
day be one of the masked singers,

91
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,280
people will briefly not know
that you are Rudy Giuliani,

92
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,160
and you will nearly be the hero.

93
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,200
But eventually,
you'll have to take your mask off,

94
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,520
and then you'll be yourself
again for the rest of your life,

95
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,320
and it will be fucking terrible.

96
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,200
Giuliani's role here
is unusual for lots of reasons.

97
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,160
He is not working for the government,
he's Trump's personal lawyer.

98
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,160
He's not being paid,
he's working for Trump for free.

99
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,360
Why is he doing that ?

100
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,640
He's going through a characteristically
messy divorce from his third wife,

101
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,040
with whom he has uncharacteristically
very few great-grandparents in common.

102
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,640
According to her, he's working pro bono
in order to reduce any future alimony.

103
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,800
So, the president
is paying Giuliani nothing,

104
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,720
and yet, I would argue,
he's still overpaying here.

105
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,520
One of Giuliani's reported complaints
against his wife is that she, I quote:

106
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,360
"Vindictively walked off with his
cable box and remote controls,"

107
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,920
"leaving him limited
to using his iPad to watch TV."

108
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,080
Rudy Giuliani, cybersecurity expert
and Donald Trump's lawyer,

109
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,520
is seemingly unaware that you can
buy new remote controls at Best Buy.

110
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,560
To recap here, it seems the president
pressured a foreign head of state

111
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,480
to investigate his political rival,
then his staff tried to cover it up.

112
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,640
And perhaps the most shocking part
of all this is, it might hurt him.

113
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,360
I know that you're probably thinking:

114
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,880
"No it won't, you fucking idiot.
Nothing Trump does ever affects him."

115
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,080
I get that has clearly been true,
until maybe now.

116
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,480
Because people
seem legitimately furious over this,

117
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,400
the House
has opened an impeachment inquiry,

118
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,800
and even a few Republicans seem to
be treading with caution for a change.

119
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,320
And it kind of does make you wonder:
why now ?

120
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,000
The president's done so many
terrible things, why this one count ?

121
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,360
It's hard to say, but it might be that
this one is simpler in some key ways.

122
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,240
'Cause unlike Trump as a candidate
asking Russia to find Hillary's emails,

123
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,080
if they're listening, this involves him
abusing the power of the presidency.

124
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,320
Unlike the meeting
with Russians at Trump Tower,

125
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,480
this time, Trump
was undeniably personally involved.

126
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,560
Unlike the multiple potential
violations of the emoluments clause,

127
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,560
we already have hard proof
that this happened.

128
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,360
Unlike Trump's treatment of migrants,

129
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,880
he can't claim this is just a difference
of political opinion,

130
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,920
he pressured Ukraine
to gain something for himself.

131
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,000
Unlike the Mueller Report's legalistic
descriptions of obstruction of justice,

132
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,080
Trump pressuring Ukraine
to get dirt on his opponent,

133
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,520
and then hiding the conversation,
is easy to understand.

134
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,080
It's just gettable. You don't need
to know any more than that

135
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,040
to know it's something presidents
should absolutely not be able to do.

136
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,800
Just like how they should
not sell the White House,

137
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,520
or suddenly change the
national anthem to this.

138
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,800
That guy might be a key player in the
impeachment of an American president !

139
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,920
What a fun time to be alive !

140
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,760
When you put all of that together,

141
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,240
this particular Trump scandal
does start to feel a little different.

142
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,040
And something that is absolutely
meriting of impeachment.

143
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,480
The fact that it is so consistent
with all Trump's other behavior

144
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,440
suggests that it is a pattern that
will continue until he leaves office,

145
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,120
one way or another.

146
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,720
It has become painfully obvious
that Trump,

147
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,680
much like all the TV channels
in Rudy Giuliani's house,

148
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,600
simply cannot be changed.

149
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,080
And now this !

150
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,520
And Now: Yet Another Installment
Of "60 Minutes" Anchors

151
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,280
Prompting Interviewees To Give
The Exact Soundbite They Need.

152
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,200
There it is, written by your own staff
and yet, nothing happened.

153
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,280
They closed the case.

154
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,960
- You're not allowed to run.
- I'm not allowed to run.

155
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,760
Because of this law.

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,120
Bad results.

157
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,600
It's possible.

158
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,040
It's heavy.

159
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,080
This is the blind mouse.

160
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,320
This is it ?

161
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,000
This is mission control.

162
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,280
And this is what's revealed.

163
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,040
All volunteers.

164
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,760
- Out of nowhere ?
- Out of nowhere.

165
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,480
- Pill spill.
- Pill spill. Huge pill spill.

166
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,360
Tuscany in a box.

167
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,520
Chateau Rudy.

168
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,560
Look at your own numbers.

169
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,000
He's only 23.

170
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,640
Tires.

171
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,680
That's a lot of kids.

172
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,040
You got a good, comfortable chair.

173
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,400
- You're a handful.
- I was a handful.

174
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,400
The dynamic changed.

175
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,960
The office was more important
than the man.

176
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,280
Human stories are human stories.

177
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,720
We've got Ned's head.

178
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,760
- That's Ned's head ?!
- That's Ned's head.

179
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,200
For our main story tonight,
let's talk about pharmacies:

180
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,840
those places
that let you arm-fuck a robot.

181
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,240
Or, as some insist on calling that:
"getting your blood pressure taken."

182
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,840
When you picture
a pharmacy in your mind,

183
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,600
you probably imagine a place that
your doctor calls in a prescription,

184
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,120
and someone counts out pills that
were manufactured somewhere else.

185
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,960
But that is actually
a relatively new phenomenon.

186
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,880
A lot of pharmacies
used to make medication on-site,

187
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,280
as this old film shows.

188
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,040
A doctor's prescription may seem
mysterious to the average layman,

189
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,680
but it's very simple
to the pharmacist.

190
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,000
It is his responsibility to make sure
that each prescription

191
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,040
is filled exactly
as the doctor has ordered.

192
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,720
An error in the compounding
of a prescription

193
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,520
can be injurious
or even fatal to the patient.

194
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,680
"Yes, any error could be fatal,"

195
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,040
"which is why we only hire
nearsighted men to eyeball ratios"

196
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,960
"out of a series
of identical bottles."

197
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,400
"If that doesn't work,
do feel free to die !"

198
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,800
"Happy 1940s to one and all !"

199
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,640
While that is no longer
how it works in your local CVS,

200
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,760
there are places that do still
make their drugs from scratch, on-site.

201
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,760
They are compounding pharmacies
and they exist for a very good reason.

202
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,760
Compounding pharmacies
make medicine

203
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,360
for people whose needs cannot
be met by an FDA approved product.

204
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,040
Let's say you're allergic to a specific
ingredient in a pill.

205
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,000
Your doctor can write a prescription
tailored to your specific needs

206
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,280
and a compounding pharmacy
will mix it.

207
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,360
Compounding pharmacies
make bespoke medication.

208
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,240
I'd say "designer drugs" if that
phrase hadn't already been taken

209
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,480
by egregiously-Dutch dealers
selling pills to suburban kids.

210
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,480
"Dish ish da good shit. Trusht me,
it's gonna shend you to outer shpace."

211
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,280
"It's for you dance partiesh."

212
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,760
There is around 7 500 compounding
pharmacies all over this country,

213
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,680
and they can fill highly specific
prescriptions for all sorts of reasons.

214
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,600
You're having trouble swallowing pills,
they can make the drug in liquid form.

215
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,280
You need a drug in a lower
concentration than what's available

216
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,800
they can do that for you.

217
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,560
They do very important work.
And it is not just humans that benefit.

218
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,080
There are no manufactured
medications made for birds.

219
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,480
So, you need to go
to your compounding pharmacist

220
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,640
so they can make the right volume,
because it could be large,

221
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,200
medium, or small.

222
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,760
Each one might like a different flavor
or require a different volume.

223
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,920
She likes pina colada flavor.

224
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,560
Does she ? Really ?

225
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,200
A tropical bird
whose favorite flavor is pina colada ?

226
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,720
I'm just gonna say it:
that parrot is basic.

227
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,840
Ya basic. You're a basic bird.

228
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,880
As you've guessed from the fact
that we're talking about this story,

229
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,600
there are some huge problems here,
because compounding pharmacies

230
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,240
are subject to much less oversight
than large drug manufacturers.

231
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,680
If you get a drug that was
mass produced in a factory,

232
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,960
both the drug and the factory
are under a lot of scrutiny.

233
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,400
But if you get one
from a compounding pharmacy,

234
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,720
it is very different, as a former head
of the FDA will tell you.

235
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,080
Compounded drugs
are not FDA approved.

236
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,720
As commissioner of the FDA
then you can't tell us sitting here now

237
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,560
that every drug being used
in the US is safe and effective ?

238
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,200
No, I really cannot.

239
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,000
Holy shit ! That's kind
of startling to hear. Isn't it ?

240
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,000
On one level,
it does make sense

241
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,040
that if compounding pharmacies
are making bespoke medication,

242
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,200
the FDA doesn't treat them
like they're a giant manufacturer.

243
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,720
You wouldn't subject
Mikey's Lemonade Stand

244
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,360
to the same regulations
Coca-Cola has to obey

245
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,200
for mass-producing Minute Maid
because that would be overkill,

246
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,000
and besides, even if Mikey did pee
a little bit in his lemonade,

247
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,240
which let's face it, he definitely did,
the damage is inherently limited.

248
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,560
But as you will see, oversight
is so lax that compounding pharmacies

249
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,320
have become the wild west
of the drug industry,

250
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,960
resulting in fraud and,
in the worst cases, many people dying.

251
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,760
You may not even know
that you're taking a compounded drug.

252
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,040
They can be used in hospitals without
your or your doctor's knowledge.

253
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,600
So let's take a look
at this industry !

254
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,960
Let's start with the fraud.
A few years back, Tricare,

255
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,320
military's health insurance program,
noticed a big increase in being billed

256
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,640
for veterans' specially
compounded scar and pain creams.

257
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,240
There was a problem, as the man
who oversaw the program admitted.

258
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,800
Are these creams a viable alternative
for treating the pain of warriors ?

259
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,800
We don't have
any evidence that supports that.

260
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,040
He was right,
those creams were total bullshit.

261
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,560
One study found they didn't work
any better

262
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,520
than treatments that contained
no medicine at all.

263
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,160
It's shocking that was allowed,
and it is why I'm so excited

264
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,000
to announce my amazing
new pain cream, Johnny Gel.

265
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,320
It's great for relieving
tenderness in your back,

266
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,080
neck and joints, and yes,
it is just mayonnaise.

267
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,840
Ask your doctor if Johnny Gel
is right for you.

268
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,320
A number of compounding pharmacies
realized that there was a loophole,

269
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,280
where they could bill Tricare
for the cost of each ingredient,

270
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,000
so they added as many expensive
ingredients as they could.

271
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,760
By the time the military
realized what happened,

272
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,680
the costs had gotten ridiculous.

273
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,800
It's been an explosion of the charges
in a short period of time.

274
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,160
We're on track
to spend over $2 billion

275
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,320
unless we get our hands
around this.

276
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,120
$2 billion ! When we talk about
overspending in the military,

277
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,240
I don't think anyone would've guessed
a not-insignificant chunk of that

278
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,920
has gone to fucking lotion.

279
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,840
Even when there isn't fraud,

280
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,240
it is not rare for compounded
medication to be ineffective.

281
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,560
When the FDA tests drugs
from commercial manufacturers,

282
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,320
the failure rate
is typically below two percent.

283
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,840
But when they ran tests
on compounded drugs,

284
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,880
33 percent of the drugs failed,
that's one in three !

285
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,720
To put that in perspective,

286
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,560
compounded drugs have the same
failure rate as the Jonas Brothers.

287
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,680
We all know which one I'm talking
about. And it is not you, Kevin.

288
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,120
You are doing great.

289
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:31,080
He's been through enough.
You're doing really great, Kevin.

290
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,960
You're actually my favorite.

291
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,160
But a drug not working is
by no means the worst-case scenario.

292
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,200
You would not expect the FDA to be
testing every smallbatch drug made,

293
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,200
you would at least hope
that someone was making sure

294
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,360
the places they were made
were clean.

295
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,240
Conditions can be appalling,
as multiple investigations found,

296
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,120
with some particularly
revolting examples.

297
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,320
In one Miami pharmacy,
a compounded drug for lung disease

298
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,360
was found in the same refrigerator
as the employees' lunch.

299
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,680
At another pharmacy,

300
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,160
compounded drugs were stored
in the employees' bathroom.

301
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,000
It sickened me. It really did.
Bothered me a lot.

302
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,840
Yeah !
It should have sickened you !

303
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,600
'Cause you should not store an open
box of loose pills next to a toilet !

304
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,880
I've never been
to pharmacy school,

305
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,400
but I'm sure lesson one is
"Don't put the pills where you poop."

306
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,320
How could that happen ?
In the absence of FDA oversight,

307
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,440
state pharmacy boards are
supposed to send inspectors

308
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,640
to make sure conditions
are sanitary.

309
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,360
But in many states, there is
a shortage of them.

310
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,040
As of 2016,
Hawaii had only one inspector,

311
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,520
Kansas had two
and Illinois had just three

312
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,560
despite the fact it has
nearly 2 700 pharmacies.

313
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,840
Each inspector would have been tasked
with 900 locations to keep an eye on.

314
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,520
The only way that is possible

315
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,000
is if the inspectors are just texting
each pharmacy: "U good ?"

316
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,880
This lack of oversight can be dangerous
if a lab is producing sterile drugs

317
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,840
that are injected
into the body.

318
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,760
A few years back, one compounding
pharmacy made national headlines,

319
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,600
after it was found to be the source
of a massive meningitis outbreak.

320
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,360
The FDA is telling doctors:

321
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,040
don't use any products from
the New England Compounding Center.

322
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,040
When they went in there,
they actually found fungus in a vial

323
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,840
that you could see with...
the naked eye.

324
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,080
They saw some guck in it. They put it
under a microscope, it was a fungus.

325
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,080
That is disgusting.

326
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,520
The only worse thing to find
in a vial than visible guck

327
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,120
would be a visible duck.

328
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,120
Putting aside the issue of hygiene,
how did you miss this ?

329
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,840
How did you not hear the quacking ?
Your oversight's a mess !

330
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,760
While it would have been comfortably
bad enough if that pharmacy, NECC,

331
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,520
was just making drugs
for individual patients,

332
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,160
it was actually
producing medication in bulk,

333
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,760
the thing it was absolutely
not supposed to do.

334
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,160
Compounding pharmacies are supposed
to do small batches

335
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,320
based on individual prescriptions.

336
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,040
NECC skirted those rules
to make more money,

337
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,720
shipping their gucky medication
to 23 different states,

338
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,760
killing more than 100 people.

339
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,600
It's a little weird you don't
remember that story, right ?

340
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,120
Although to be fair, it was 2012,

341
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,400
and we were all distracted trying
to find Kony at the time.

342
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,680
Where's Kony ? Did we get him ?
Did we get Kony ?

343
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,040
Does anyone remember ?
It seemed so important at the time !

344
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,200
I bet we got him. We wouldn't have
just given up, would we ?

345
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,520
While regulations required
them to have an individual prescription,

346
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,000
they managed to get around that
by faking patient names

347
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,480
and not even seeming
to try that hard.

348
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,040
Investigators also allege that
employees falsified prescriptions

349
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,240
with fake names like
"Big Baby Jesus", "Roy Rogers",

350
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,320
"Wonder Woman"
and "Bud Weiser".

351
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,680
Come on ! "Bud Weiser" ? It's like
they were trying to get caught.

352
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,960
They also filled prescriptions with
names, and this is real,

353
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,680
like Jimmy Kimmel,
David Schwimmer, Michael Bolton,

354
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,560
Jack Bauer, Sarah Marshall,
RuPaul and Method Man.

355
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,480
And that is such a gloriously
random group of people.

356
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,360
Most people would see
no connection between them,

357
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,120
unless you are me and you
have some very specific,

358
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,400
very bold theories
about who killed JFK.

359
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,440
I've nearly cracked it.
None of you leave the country.

360
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,080
I think there may have been
a second Schwimmer !

361
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,200
This scheme though
was incredibly lucrative.

362
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,160
The president of NECC, Barry Cadden,
made over $60 million

363
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,760
in the three years leading up
to the outbreak.

364
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,320
He seemed to know
what he was doing was wrong.

365
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,600
He was once asked at a filmed
employee training session

366
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:05,520
about keeping records of patients,
his answer was comically suspicious.

367
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,040
Is it a one-to-one
on patient names ?

368
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,440
That's something for another time.
Yeah.

369
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,400
We can't talk about that. That's one
of the more difficult things we do.

370
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,040
Let's just talk
about the products now...

371
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,920
... while we're
being recorded.

372
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,400
If you are being recorded
saying you don't want to say something

373
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,440
while being recorded,
you've probably said too much.

374
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,600
This is where we keep the guns,
the ski masks...

375
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,000
And the big bags of money...
Where does that money come from ?

376
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,760
I probably shouldn't talk about that
while we're being recorded.

377
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,960
The defining hallmark of NECC
was how clearly everyone knew

378
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,600
they were breaking the law.

379
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,120
The company's national sales director
even sent out an email

380
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,320
with the unassuming subject line:
"HUGE IMPORTANCE !"

381
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,160
Which reads in part:

382
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,200
"All names must resemble 'real' names,
no obviously fake names !"

383
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,640
And "I know I don't have to say this
but never put anything in writing."

384
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,960
Which is an incredible thing
to put in writing.

385
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,240
Thankfully, Cadden went to prison.
Congress passed a law toughening up

386
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,640
enforcement of regulations
among compounding pharmacies.

387
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:31,640
Which is great, in theory.
They wrote in some massive loopholes.

388
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,680
The law required any pharmacy
that wanted to mass-produce drugs,

389
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,280
the way that NECC did,

390
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,600
to register as something called
an "outsourcing facility"

391
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,960
and submit
to much stricter inspections.

392
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,400
It made doing so voluntary.

393
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:51,200
If you need everyone to obey a rule,
it just can't be voluntary.

394
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,040
It's why stop signs say "Stop"
and not "Shrug Emoji".

395
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,120
Unsurprisingly, only 77 facilities
are currently registered,

396
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,200
that's one percent
of compounding pharmacies.

397
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,240
Because the FDA had no system
to catch violators,

398
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,680
many pharmacies carried on
exactly as they were,

399
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,800
with some being
pretty bold about it.

400
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,240
How bold ? Just watch this.

401
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,600
The FDA's inspection
of Downing Labs in July

402
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,480
found sterility failures
in 19 lots of drug products.

403
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,880
Ashley Downing is
the co-owner of Downing Labs.

404
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,720
They asked you to recall
sterile products.

405
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,840
Correct.

406
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,560
- And you decided what ?
- No.

407
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,920
Just "no". That's it. She responded
to a request for a drug recall

408
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,800
the way most of us responded to seeing
the trailer for the movie "Cats".

409
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,240
No. I refuse to acknowledge
that this is happening. No.

410
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,880
She claimed the FDA
had no jurisdiction over her

411
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,600
and that she'd followed
all state requirements.

412
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,280
The FDA disagreed and while they
did manage to force her to comply,

413
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,080
that didn't happen until almost
a full year after that interview.

414
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,280
And when oversight
is this weak,

415
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,680
compounding pharmacies can hurt large
numbers of people for a long time.

416
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:15,000
Look at what happened in Texas
with Guardian Pharmacy Services.

417
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,160
This is it here. They apparently
mass produced medicine

418
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,080
which was injected into people's eyes
and which turned out to contain

419
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,800
formaldehyde and acetone,

420
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,240
two things pretty high up the list of
"things to keep away from your eyes",

421
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,400
right above jalapeno peppers
and just below the trailer for "Cats".

422
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,680
No. I said no.

423
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,720
Guardian didn't opt in
for FDA oversight,

424
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,800
so it was regulated at the state level
but not, it seems, very well.

425
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,560
70 people injected with their drugs
are now partially or completely blind.

426
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,400
It took six months from the first
injections for state regulators

427
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,640
to even be notified
there was a problem.

428
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:02,440
Which is something frustrating for
those who ended up losing their sight.

429
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,480
By the time Susie Pope went in for
cataract surgery at Dallas Eye Clinic,

430
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,880
dozens of patients
had gone before her.

431
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,480
How could 68 people be involved before
they pull that off the shelf ?

432
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,800
Many of them have
the same question.

433
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:24,600
We notice how when lettuce is bad,
we pulled it off the shelf every week.

434
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,120
Yeah. And of course, he's right.
It's not unreasonable to want a world

435
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,640
where something that's about
to be injected into your eyeball

436
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,720
is at least as safe as lettuce.

437
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,600
I'll tell you what is as safe
as lettuce and that is Johnny Gel.

438
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,680
Johnny Gel may not be
as safe as lettuce.

439
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:49,240
Not only did the Texas State Pharmacy
Board not shut down Guardian,

440
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,280
they haven't shut down a single
pharmacy in at least five years.

441
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,480
They did put Guardian's license
on probation.

442
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,040
But the man behind it shut it down
and opened up a pharmacy

443
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,840
called Medical Park Pharmacy
at the same location.

444
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,120
So, their door simply
changed from this, to this.

445
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,800
And it is hard to notice any
meaningful differences there,

446
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,240
even if you weren't blinded
by tainted eye medication.

447
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,840
Compounded pharmacists
play an important role.

448
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,760
That is all the more reason
why they should be regulated.

449
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,560
So, at the very least, we need
more inspectors at the state level,

450
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,160
the outsourcing facility designation
should not be voluntary

451
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,080
and compounders should have
to alert regulators

452
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,720
whenever they fuck up.

453
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,160
Until then, bad facilities
could probably really benefit

454
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,240
from a message from some of the very
real names that they've thrown around

455
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,240
in their nonsense prescriptions.

456
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,240
I'm David Schwimmer.

457
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,400
I'm Method Man.

458
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,280
I am obviously RuPaul.

459
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,440
I'm Jimmy Kimmel, America's
favorite late-night host, by far.

460
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,000
And I'm the one and only
Michael Bolton.

461
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,680
We'd like to say a few words
to compounding pharmacies.

462
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,080
Please don't use our names in your
bullshit prescriptions.

463
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,840
We're not random words to be thrown
around so you can evade the law.

464
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,160
We're real people.

465
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,560
Some of us are.
Like me, "Jack Bauer".

466
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,280
And me, "Sarah Marshall".

467
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,760
Who ?

468
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,080
Do not tell me you forgot
Sarah Marshall.

469
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,960
You're the one who broke up
with Jason Segal's dick.

470
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,120
Sure did.

471
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,320
The point is, we're mad.

472
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,560
Real mad.

473
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,840
Our names don't belong on
your fraudulent spinal medication.

474
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,080
Mine belongs on a platinum album.

475
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,920
Mine belongs on the list of America's
top pretend paleontologists.

476
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,120
And mine belongs on the Emmy
for "Outstanding Variety Talk Series"

477
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,320
that somebody else keeps winning.

478
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,960
Stop using our names to turn
your compounding pharmacy

479
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,960
into an unregulated
drug manufacturer.

480
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,280
While we're at it,
don't even think about

481
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,960
trying to sell us any of that
$15 000 skin cream.

482
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,560
Don't want to be involved
in your lotion scam.

483
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:03,040
No, honey. I am not getting mixed up
in your ointment scheme. Goodbye.

484
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,720
If you're an outsourcing facility,
let yourself be regulated like one.

485
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,320
If you don't...

486
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,880
I will tie you up in a dark basement
in southern Turkmenistan

487
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
and inflict a level of pain on you
you could not imagine

488
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,600
in your darkest,
most terrifying nightmares.

489
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,120
Jesus Christ.

490
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,840
We need to make sure that compounded
drugs are coming from labs

491
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,600
that fully comply
with safety guidelines.

492
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,080
Lots of people
need compounded drugs.

493
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,240
And it's not just people.
My bird needs them, too.

494
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,480
Yeah, my... What ?
Michael Bolton has a parrot ?

495
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,680
Of course I do. I love parrots.
Do people not realize

496
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,520
that "How Am I Supposed to Live
Without You ?" is about a lady parrot ?

497
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,680
I loved that parrot.
And she left me.

498
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,960
She did leave him... For me.
Fuck you, Michael Bolton.

499
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,360
Yeah, fuck you, Michael Bolton.

500
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,560
Fuck you !

501
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,200
Until you're better regulated,

502
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,080
you should stick to what
you were designed to do.

503
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,360
Making pina coladas for birds.

504
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,160
I miss you.

505
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,600
What the fuck ?

506
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,520
That's our show, thanks for watching.
See you next week ! Good night !

507
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,840
Girl, look. I'm a queen.

508
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,520
I've been involved with
some real shady schemes, okay ?

509
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,960
But I'm not getting mixed up
in some shady ointment scheme !

510
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,200
Ointment scheme ?

511
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,240
Ointment scheme ?
Please !

512
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,800
I'm not opposed to schemes.
I'm a queen.

513
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,000
But I'm not getting mixed up
in some shady ointment scheme.

514
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,560
Ointment scheme ?
Please !

515
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,000
