00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,040
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,640
SEASON VI
EPISODE 26

3
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,720
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,560
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,760
Let us dive straight in with the latest
developments in Stupid Watergate II.

6
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,240
A sequel no one wanted,
to a sequel no one wanted.

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,560
If Stupid Watergate
was "Blues Brothers 2000,"

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,880
this is "Blues Brothers
September the 11th 2001."

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,200
It was a very dramatic week,
culminating in this news on Friday.

10
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,440
According to "The New York Times",
Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani

11
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,760
is under federal criminal investigation
over his work in Ukraine.

12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,240
It's true. Giuliani may be
under federal investigation.

13
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,400
Events have caught up with his face,
which perpetually looks like someone

14
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,200
who just found out
they're under investigation.

15
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,280
This news shouldn't be surprising.

16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,320
On a list of things that Giuliani
is likely to be under,

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,920
"federal investigation" might
even beat out "his own cousin."

18
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,360
The specifics are incredible.
Because the investigation is tied

19
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,920
to two of Giuliani's associates,
arrested on Wednesday.

20
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,960
U.S. nationals Lev Parnas
and Igor Fruman were charged

21
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,960
with illegally funneling foreign
donations to political campaigns,

22
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,240
including $325 000 to
a pro-Trump super PAC.

23
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,680
These two men are just
cartoonishly suspicious.

24
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,560
They look
like they're about to sell you

25
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,080
a rocket launcher
in a Grand Theft Auto game.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,840
If that wasn't suspicious enough,
they were arrested at the airport,

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,880
trying to fly out of the country
with one-way tickets.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,040
The indictment against them
has more amazing details.

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,080
It alleges that they funneled foreign
money to U.S. political campaigns

30
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,960
and Fruman apparently tried
to evade detection

31
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,200
by misspelling his own name,

32
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,240
making contributions in the name
of Igor "Furman", not "Fruman".

33
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,280
If all you're gonna do
is move your letters around,

34
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,160
how about "Mr. Go Fun Air" ?

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,760
It's not only harder to detect, maybe
they won't arrest you at the airport.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,520
"We can't stop him from flying,
he's Mr. Go Fun Air !"

37
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,320
Thanks largely
to their political contributions,

38
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,280
these two gained entry
to Republican inner circles.

39
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,200
Here's a photo one of them posted,

40
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,760
captioned "Power breakfast !"
with Don Jr.,

41
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,640
whose presence alone disqualifies
this meal from being a power breakfast.

42
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,120
At best, it's a "neglected-by-power
since childhood brunch". At best.

43
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,560
Here they are with Trump and
Pence at the White House.

44
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,040
It's gonna be difficult for Giuliani
to distance himself here,

45
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,560
because he had lunch with them
hours before they were arrested

46
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,480
and it is not hard to find evidence
of their relationship online.

47
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,440
This video, from 2018,
shows them laughing it up

48
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,480
with Giuliani
at the Trump Hotel.

49
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,000
See you in Ukraine soon.

50
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,720
Just look at those guys:
laughin', drinkin', ties undone.

51
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,960
They're like the Rat Pack if
the Rat Pack was deeply uncool

52
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,920
and had even more suspected ties
to organized crime.

53
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,320
While there is much more
we need to know here,

54
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,120
it's incredible how much
you can piece together,

55
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,640
just from information
in the public domain.

56
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,000
We know Giuliani wanted
career diplomat Marie Yovanovitch

57
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,040
removed as ambassador
to Ukraine,

58
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,840
he felt she was blocking
his anti-Biden campaign.

59
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,200
Igor and Lev also wanted her gone.
Enter Congressman Pete Sessions.

60
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,880
Igor and Lev donated a bunch
of money to him, and at a meeting,

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,920
Parnas told him the ambassador
was disloyal to Trump

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,440
and she'd been
bad-mouthing our president.

63
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,680
We know this meeting happened,
not from a whistleblower,

64
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,280
but because Parnas posted these
pictures with Sessions,

65
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,000
captioned, "Hard at work !"

66
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,280
That same day, Sessions wrote
to Mike Pompeo, telling him he had

67
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,880
"evidence from close companions
that Yovanovitch had spoken"

68
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,960
"about her disdain
for the current administration."

69
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,240
Trump removed her,
even bragging about it after the fact.

70
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,120
In the July phone call
with the Ukrainian president

71
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,480
that sparked
this impeachment inquiry,

72
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,760
Trump called Yovanovitch
"bad news",

73
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,160
later saying, she was going
to "go through some things".

74
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,480
That sounds pretty ominous,
although by "go through some things",

75
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,840
he meant: "continue to live
in this Kafka-esque nightmare"

76
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,920
"where Trump
is president of the US",

77
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,600
in which case, all of us are going
through some things now, buddy.

78
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,960
Same.

79
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,480
So these two goons allegedly
used money from foreign sources

80
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,920
to start a whisper campaign to get
a U.S. ambassador removed.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,960
It's amazing they were taken
seriously by anyone,

82
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,840
given the obvious red flags.

83
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,560
The company one of them
paid Giuliani through

84
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,280
was called
"Fraud Guarantee".

85
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,680
The equivalent of owning an
exterminating company

86
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,240
called "Mouse Promise".

87
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,120
Our promise is, there will
not be mice. Mouse Promise.

88
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,920
It's hard to say what will happen
going forward here.

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,280
But it's not looking
great for Giuliani,

90
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,400
after the lukewarm endorsement
he got on Friday.

91
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,840
Is Rudy Giuliani
still your personal attorney ?

92
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,640
I haven't spoken to Rudy.
I spoke to him yesterday briefly.

93
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,320
He's a very good attorney
and he has been my attorney.

94
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,960
That is not good, Rudy.

95
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,160
History suggests that sooner or
later, Trump will abandon him.

96
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,880
At which point,
to paraphrase his maybe-client,

97
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,400
Giuliani is probably going to be
"going through some things".

98
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,240
Let's move on to Hong Kong.
The semi-autonomous region of China

99
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,560
that's ostensibly free
but kind of not.

100
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,600
Like Candy Crush, or this plate
of spaghetti unguarded in a field.

101
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,320
It's tempting, but something
doesn't line up here. It's too easy.

102
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,560
For five months, Hong Kong
has experienced

103
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,880
the largest pro-democracy
demonstrations in its history

104
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,120
and China has been clamping down
hard on businesses expressing support.

105
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,200
This week saw another flare-up.

106
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,360
NBA tries to minimize damage
after an international incident.

107
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,280
It all started with this tweet from
Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey:

108
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,920
"Fight for freedom,
stand with Hong Kong."

109
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,480
Fresh backlash from
the regime in Beijing.

110
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,920
China state TV won't broadcast
or stream NBA pre-season games

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,040
and two major Chinese retailers

112
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,680
have pulled Houston Rockets
merchandise from their websites.

113
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,880
The Chinese government upended
the NBA's business in that country

114
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,080
over a single
tweet from this guy.

115
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,840
It's absurd to get that angry at Morey
for supporting pro-democracy protests.

116
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,760
How about the fact he traded away

117
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,040
power forward Marquese Chriss
as part of a three-team deal

118
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,000
with the Kings and the Cavaliers ?

119
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,200
Chriss is 6-10
with a 7-foot wingspan,

120
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,000
plays way above the rim
and can mix it up in the post.

121
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,040
He's had his issues on the Suns,
I'm not denying that,

122
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,760
but he's the type that could've
balanced out Westbrook and Harden,

123
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,000
especially when he's coming
off the bench for PJ Tucker.

124
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,680
Your tweet about
Hong Kong was fine.

125
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,560
When it comes to Marquese Chriss,
you fucked up, Daryl.

126
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,040
I'm not even a Rockets fan.

127
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,880
I'm just a fan of competent
mid-season roster moves.

128
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,400
The NBA has put itself
in a tight spot here.

129
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,080
It's been expanding into China,
with a $1.5 billion digital partnership

130
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,320
with a Chinese tech company,
to say nothing of NBA China,

131
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,120
the league's business arm
managing events there,

132
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,600
which is worth
more than $4 billion alone.

133
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,840
They've worked hard to appeal
to the Chinese market,

134
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,480
as you can tell
by this ad produced last year.

135
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,640
Happy New Year.

136
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,720
Happy New Year.

137
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,360
Wishing you luck
in the year of the dog.

138
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,960
Happy Chinese New Year.

139
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,560
My name is Lance Stephenson, I want
to say Happy Chinese New Year.

140
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,960
There's nothing more
cringeworthy than watching someone

141
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,440
forced to engage in promotional
bullshit to appease the whims

142
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,000
of their parent company.

143
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,720
Speaking of parent companies,
that reminds me:

144
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,800
Have you heard
about HBO Max ?

145
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,720
Looking to add another app and monthly
charge to watch things ?

146
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,800
HBO Max has you covered !
It's gonna have all your favorites:

147
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,200
reruns of "The Big Bang Theory",
reruns of "Friends",

148
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,680
reruns
of "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air".

149
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,160
You can pay for all of those
through HBO Max !

150
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,440
HBO Max: it's not HBO,
it's just TV !

151
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,600
While Adam Silver, the NBA
commissioner, has stood by Morey,

152
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,520
it has been disappointing to see
others like, ESPN's Stephen A. Smith,

153
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,280
criticizing his tweet for jeopardizing
the league's bottom line.

154
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,480
If you've never heard
Stephen A. Smith talk before,

155
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,080
he tends to be loud, wrong and
take pointlessly dramatic pauses.

156
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,360
You don't just think
about yourself when you act.

157
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,600
That's what boys and girls do.
That's what children do.

158
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,000
Grown ups ! Adults !

159
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,840
People who understand !
What it's like to build something !

160
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,680
To have something !

161
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,120
And to be responsible for people
other than themselves !

162
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:46,000
They get that you don't
just speak willy-nilly.

163
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,160
Run your mouth.

164
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,720
Without a thought to the consequences
coming down the pike.

165
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,440
If you're not a sports fan and you're
just now seeing Stephen A. Smith,

166
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,360
let me address a few things
quickly: one, I'm sorry.

167
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,440
Two, yes, he's always like that.
And three, no one knows why.

168
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,280
Smith is arguing that casually
turning a blind eye

169
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,480
to human rights violations is okay
if is in your company's interest.

170
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,240
That feels fundamentally wrong.

171
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,760
Especially given that some teams
now seem to be enforcing

172
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,480
Chinese restrictions on speech
here in the U.S.

173
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,720
Sam Wachs and his wife held
"Free Hong Kong" signs

174
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,800
at last night's Sixers game
against a team from China.

175
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,040
When Wachs started yelling:
"Free Hong Kong",

176
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,120
he was escorted away by security.

177
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,920
Those fans were deemed
too outspoken and obnoxious

178
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,200
for professional sports
in Philly.

179
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,240
In Philly ! A city where
fans have booed Santa Claus,

180
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,920
punched police horses and
vomited on an 11-year-old girl.

181
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,800
That is troubling.
Because the NBA,

182
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,800
to its credit
and unlike other leagues,

183
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,720
has accepted that its employees are
people and people have opinions.

184
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,000
What makes this situation
different is money.

185
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,000
The NBA can either
have a commitment to free speech

186
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,320
or they can have guaranteed
access to the Chinese market,

187
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,200
but they cannot have both.

188
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,680
This will not be the last time
they'll be forced to choose.

189
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,720
My fear is they'll be
willing to trade one for the other.

190
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,480
Which would be the worst trade

191
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,320
since Daryl Morey shipped out
Marquese Chriss.

192
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,720
I'm with you on Hong Kong, Daryl,
but that was fucked up.

193
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,760
And now this.

194
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:40,640
Farewell, Shep Smith. You Were Always
Too Weird For Where You Worked.

195
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,560
Would you look at that ?
It's a total eclipse of the sun !

196
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,120
If I put this here
and my phone here,

197
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,520
I have a total eclipse of the phone.

198
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,440
Are you gonna
watch "True Blood" this weekend ?

199
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,320
- I'm not a "True Blood" fan.
- You are crazy.

200
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,520
Pop-Tarts now has a store
in Times Square. Pop-Tarts.

201
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,960
I say we bring back the porn stores.

202
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,560
Do you think he's aware
he's wearing mom jeans ?

203
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,520
He's wearing mom jeans, Carl.
It's 2012.

204
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,400
- You have a Chapstick fetish !
- Fetish ?

205
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,640
Google the word and then realize
that is not what I have.

206
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,640
Do you watch "True Blood" ?

207
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,320
That was a scene from the HBO
show "True Blood", the best show ever.

208
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,640
- You have DVR ?
- Yeah.

209
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,520
Record the "True Blood."

210
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,240
And now you know the news.

211
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,960
For this Monday, May the 9th,
2011, I'm a silly little catfish.

212
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,600
Moving on. For our main story,
I'd like to talk about the weather.

213
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,040
I mean all of it: The hots.
The wets. The whooshes. The brrrs.

214
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,800
And, of course,
the flashy-flashy boom-booms.

215
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,160
Predicting the weather is
a multibillion-dollar industry

216
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,760
that can affect businesses
and save lives.

217
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,200
There is pressure
on weather forecasters.

218
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,480
Might explain
why they sometimes snap.

219
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,320
I want you guys to say: "Great news.
It's gonna be 60 on Friday."

220
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,880
I thought you said
it was going to snow again.

221
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,360
What do you want me to do ? Lie ?
I'll put 70 everyday next time.

222
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,400
Here's some wind,
here's some temperature,

223
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,440
20s, feels like 19,
or it feels like 70, I don't know.

224
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,880
47, partly cloudy,
southwest breeze 10 to 15.

225
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,360
Here's a 60, I don't know if that's
good enough for you guys.

226
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,720
Get excited. Maybe I'll disappoint you
with the 7 Day here in a few minutes.

227
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,760
I honestly wish all local
news was delivered like that.

228
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,200
A gas station got robbed,
that's not my fucking fault.

229
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,920
Traffic, no delays in getting you home
to your sad lives and your ugly kids.

230
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,760
And in sports: any athlete could fuck
your spouse if they wanted to.

231
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,520
That's the news, suck on this one,
sit on that one.

232
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,520
Maybe you don't get your weather
from local news, maybe you use an app,

233
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,280
like the one that came with your
phone or Dark Sky,

234
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,360
or Weather Underground, or from
The Weather Channel or AccuWeather.

235
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,160
In New York, you might get your
weather from NY 1's Twitter account.

236
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,440
And if you don't,
you absolutely should,

237
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,120
their forecast for the first
of this month was:

238
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,320
"October got off to a warm start
today. Enjoy the month."

239
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,880
"It's the last good one for NYC until
May. The rest are trash".

240
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,680
Which is excellent.

241
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,520
Wherever you get your weather from,
if you live in the U.S.,

242
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,440
your forecast would not exist
without the National Weather Service.

243
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,880
It's a subset of its parent
agency, NOAA,

244
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,520
it's an incredible government service
generating essential information.

245
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,480
But unfortunately,
it may be under serious threat.

246
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,520
Tonight, much like two colleagues
in an elevator:

247
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,440
let's talk about the weather.

248
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,680
Let's start with the fact
the National Weather Service

249
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,400
harvests a huge amount
of data every day.

250
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,000
All the other private weather
services you can possibly think of

251
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,560
are dependent on that data
to make their own predictions.

252
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,960
Here's one meteorologist
pointing exactly that out.

253
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,520
All the forecast warnings
and data available

254
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,800
from the National Weather Service
is there free of charge.

255
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,840
Even though you don't know
our names or see our faces,

256
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,520
those products and services
that you see almost every day

257
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,240
originated from
the National Weather Service.

258
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,600
Yeah
and he's absolutely right.

259
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,160
National Weather Service data
is to a weather forecast

260
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,280
what fresh wolverine meat
is to Hormel Chili.

261
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,560
You can't make one
without the other,

262
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,840
it's the dominant ingredient there.

263
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,360
National Weather Service works
in tandem with organizations

264
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,160
all over the world through
the World Meteorological Organization,

265
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,360
where countries share essential
data on a free and unrestricted basis.

266
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,080
This actually works out
very well for the U.S.,

267
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,040
we receive three times more data
back from our partners than we give.

268
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,200
We've benefited from that
in the past.

269
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,520
In 2012, the U.S. model initially
had Hurricane Sandy

270
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,040
heading out to the ocean,
while the European model showed it

271
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,000
making a sharp left
turn and hitting the East Coast,

272
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,240
which it did.

273
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,600
Because we had that early warning,
countless lives were saved.

274
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,680
Virtually the entire world participates
in a weather observation system

275
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,760
that most people have never heard of

276
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,600
and that private companies
benefit greatly from.

277
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,680
Which is not to say that
companies don't add value here.

278
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,960
When a local news station subscribes
to, say, AccuWeather,

279
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,880
it gets their state-of-the-art
graphics packages.

280
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,480
That's been a big part of their
brand since at least the eighties.

281
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,200
Whatever you need,
AccuWeather has it.

282
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,800
Select from thousands of award-winning
graphics, satellite and radar images,

283
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,200
graphics that are at the cutting edge
of design and accuracy.

284
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,960
Know about the worst weather,

285
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,240
like this nasty Christmas Eve
in Bradford, Pennsylvania,

286
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,520
or this blizzard in Lone Tree,
Wyoming.

287
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,480
Trivia questions can help hold
your audience with tantalizing facts.

288
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,320
When the weather is in the
news, you can be on top of it

289
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,760
with graphics
like this one of Chernobyl.

290
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,680
Fun Chernobyl graphic,
AccuWeather.

291
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,600
Looks like a screenshot from
the world's saddest Nintendo game

292
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,720
where the levels you progress through
are Stages I, II, III, and IV cancer.

293
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,720
And to this day, the private sector

294
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,560
is on the cutting edge
of dressing up weather data.

295
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,080
One of AccuWeather's main
competitors, The Weather Channel,

296
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,360
produces spectacular and pointless
graphics to dramatize severe weather.

297
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,720
The semi might break through the ice.
We start to run into trouble.

298
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,040
You need it to support
the weight of a man.

299
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,960
There can be extensive
power outages. Air-like missile.

300
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,680
Holy shit !
Let's all just be thankful

301
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,280
that those graphics that advanced were
not around during Chernobyl.

302
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,400
Companies don't just
provide graphics.

303
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,960
Some have their own
data-collection systems

304
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,840
and can use them to augment
the Weather Service data

305
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,000
and tailor forecasts
for specific clients.

306
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,000
They could tell a trucking company
what roads will be safest to drive on

307
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,480
ahead of winter storms.

308
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,040
Listen to Joel Myers, founder
and CEO of AccuWeather,

309
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,000
as he provides another
vivid example.

310
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,080
Eddie Vedder was doing
a concert in Chicago.

311
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,000
Live Nation uses our service.
We gave them a warning.

312
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,560
He said: "We heard from AccuWeather,
we need to clear the field."

313
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,880
They did. 20 minutes later
with everybody out of harm's way,

314
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,400
a lightning storm hit
and struck the stage,

315
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,200
where he had been standing.

316
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,720
He is claiming AccuWeather
saved Eddie Vedder's life !

317
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,040
I guess that's what Eddie was talking
about when he famously said:

318
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,840
I'm still alive.

319
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,240
I'm still alive.

320
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,120
Myers makes a good case for the value
of private weather companies.

321
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,360
Making sure Eddie Vedder doesn't
get struck by lightning

322
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,320
is not something the National Weather
Service has the bandwidth to do.

323
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,680
The relationship between
the public and the private sector

324
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,280
is mutually beneficial,
in fact, sometimes,

325
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,400
the Weather Service
buys data from private companies.

326
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,360
But there can be tensions.
The private sector is, by its nature,

327
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,440
inclined to try and grab attention.

328
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,840
AccuWeather rolled out
its "groundbreaking 45-day forecast".

329
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,840
Most experts agree any forecast
beyond seven to 10 days is unreliable

330
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,160
and one even called it "a joke".

331
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,440
It gets worse. The National Weather
Service names tropical storms.

332
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,240
They name them to signal
that they are important.

333
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,640
If a storm gets a name,
like Sandy or Irene,

334
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,040
then you know
you've got to pay attention.

335
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,880
They don't name winter storms,

336
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,920
because winter storms
ebb and flow much more.

337
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,280
Naming them could inflate
their importance or, eventually,

338
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,480
cheapen naming storms altogether.

339
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,320
It bugged the shit
out of the Weather Service

340
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,240
when The Weather Channel
started doing this.

341
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,400
This season The Weather Channel
is naming major winter storms.

342
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,600
The list includes names like:
Athena, Draco and Magnus.

343
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,800
Right, and yes, those names
fucking rule. Obviously.

344
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,280
I'm not disputing that.
Naming them was a bad idea.

345
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Especially if you call one "Janus",
without  considering

346
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,400
what would happen if a forecaster
stood in front of one of those letters.

347
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,320
You've got a problem on
your hands, don't you ?

348
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,720
Honey ! The news is saying
anus is getting bigger

349
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,080
and it's gonna be dumping all over
us for the next three days.

350
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,000
A bigger source of friction has been
the private sector's sense

351
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,520
they might be better off if
the National Weather Service did less.

352
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,120
One notable skirmish
came 15 years ago,

353
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,720
after National Weather Service
made its website user-friendly

354
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,560
and Joel Myers' brother Barry Myers,
who was then the company's EVP,

355
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,760
expressed his frustration.

356
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,520
The National Weather Service
decided

357
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,400
to more aggressively share
its data directly with taxpayers.

358
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,920
Not everyone is in favor
of its more accessible website.

359
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,080
We work very hard everyday
competing with other companies.

360
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,920
We also have to compete
with the government.

361
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,040
Hold on. Do you, though ?
Do you have to compete ?

362
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,000
Or is the government what makes
your industry possible ?

363
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,680
Without their data, every AccuWeather
forecast would be: "Fuck if I know."

364
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,360
AccuWeather supported
a bill in Congress

365
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,960
that could've prevented
the Weather Service

366
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,480
from doing anything
a private company does.

367
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,400
Like providing daily forecasts
or putting content on its Web site.

368
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,720
The bill failed, which is good.
Because what you do not want

369
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,480
is a paywalled system of weather,
where only paying customers

370
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,880
can find out if they're about
to drive into a tornado.

371
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,040
I'm not even making up
that worst-case scenario.

372
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,360
It's AccuWeather's sales pitch.
During that interview

373
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,600
where Joel Myers claimed
he'd saved Eddie Vedder's life,

374
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,920
he shared an anecdote,
about a client, a railroad company,

375
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,240
that pays AccuWeather to give reports
about anything affecting its trains.

376
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,520
This is subtle, but see if you can
pick up on a problem here.

377
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,440
Union Pacific, we told them that
a tornado was heading to a spot.

378
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,400
Two trains
stopped two miles apart.

379
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,680
They watched the tornado go between
them. Unfortunately it went into a town

380
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,600
that didn't have our service and
people were killed.

381
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,960
But the railroads
did not lose anything.

382
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,480
The fuck did you just say ?

383
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,200
That is a weird focus on the safety
of a railroad over human life.

384
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,320
That's a man who read
"Anna Karenina" and came away

385
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,280
thinking it's a story about a woman
who mildly inconvenienced a train.

386
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,760
While people did die
in that tornado,

387
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,160
it was an example of
the warning system working well.

388
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,400
Because while, yes, AccuWeather
did inform their client, Union Pacific,

389
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,360
the National Weather Service
also warned the town,

390
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,960
giving residents there
time to seek shelter.

391
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,280
Myers is marketing AccuWeather
as indispensable for public safety,

392
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,880
which, thanks to the current strength
of the National Weather Service, isn't.

393
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,240
Freely shared information has
potentially life-saving value.

394
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,520
At times, his brother
Barry has argued otherwise.

395
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,280
Remember how our partners in Europe
helped us prepare for Sandy ?

396
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,320
Listen to how he described that.

397
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,360
Of special focus during
Superstorm Sandy

398
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,240
was the ECMWF so called
European model which did a better job,

399
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,560
at some points, in the storm track
than U.S. models did.

400
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,640
Relying on other countries
for better weather models

401
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,520
places America in a weak
and subservient position.

402
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,640
Wait. Cooperation makes
America weak and subservient ?

403
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,400
A viewpoint that would
make for a tantalizing bit

404
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,880
of AccuWeather trivia.

405
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,120
"Who lost World War II ?
Britain, for accepting help."

406
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,800
It is crucial that whoever runs
the National Weather Service

407
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,880
is someone who  sees the benefits
of international cooperation

408
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,680
and can stand up to the potential
pressures of the private sector

409
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,640
and particularly
Joel and Barry Myers.

410
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,160
At this point, you can
probably guess what's coming.

411
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,320
President Trump nominating
AccuWeather CEO, he's Barry Myers,

412
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,720
to be the undersecretary
of the National Weather Service.

413
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,400
An interesting nomination.

414
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,040
Yes it is !

415
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,440
In fact, you could even say
it's "incredibly predictable".

416
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,640
Everything Trump does is designed
to destroy government from the inside !

417
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,080
The National Weather Service
is a terrible government agency

418
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,080
to put in the hands
of a businessman.

419
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,760
While Myers has stepped down
from AccuWeather,

420
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,160
it is still
very much a family business,

421
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,000
with his son-in-law and wife
being employed there

422
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,640
and his two brothers still serving
as CEO and COO of the company.

423
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,200
During his confirmation hearing,

424
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,000
Myers insisted
that wouldn't be a problem.

425
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,840
I have made it clear to my brothers,
in fact jokingly I explained to them

426
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,120
that we may see each other
at Thanksgiving dinner

427
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,640
and we can talk about football
and family things,

428
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,520
but we cannot talk about NOAA.

429
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,680
Really ? You won't talk
about the thing

430
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,280
that could vastly enrich
the family business at Thanksgiving ?

431
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,800
Conveniently, Thanksgiving is
now exactly 45 days away,

432
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,800
so allow me to make
a 45 Day forecast: bullshit.

433
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,440
It is worth asking here:
why, aside from the obvious,

434
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,960
would Barry Myers
want this job ?

435
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,560
If you think:
"Maybe he's just a weather nerd"

436
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,400
"who wanted to be
at the source of information.",

437
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,560
he is not that.

438
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,680
He told
"The Wall Street Journal":

439
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,520
"I'm not a meteorologist",
and that, as a young man,

440
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,560
"I knew meteorology was
not what I wanted to do."

441
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,480
Not like he's hoping to parlay this job
into a future lobbying gig on K Street.

442
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,920
He's a 76-year old
multi-millionaire.

443
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,560
So, he has no passion
for the subject matter

444
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,880
and his family company is
a direct competitor

445
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,080
to the agency he's been
tapped to run.

446
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,440
There is one more concern
hanging over his nomination.

447
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,160
The Labor Department
investigation into AccuWeather

448
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,520
found multiple
sexual harassment claims

449
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,280
were ignored by executives.

450
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,160
It says women who
complained feared retaliation.

451
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,440
The investigation said
the company had

452
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,040
a "severe and pervasive"
harassment problem.

453
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:49,000
The company denies the allegations,
they also chose not to fight them.

454
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,720
Myers has been Trump's nominee
for two years now.

455
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,400
He hasn't been in the job,

456
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,640
because the Senate has been
sitting on his confirmation.

457
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,280
Trump's had to re-submit
his nomination twice

458
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,200
and if Myers isn't confirmed
by the end of this year,

459
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,760
he'll have to do it again.

460
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,240
Which, why ?
Why not find another guy ?

461
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,400
Any other guy !
Other than, of course,

462
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,920
the fact that for that to happen,
Trump would have to do stuff,

463
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,280
know stuff, and think workplace
harassment is a bad thing.

464
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,000
None of us should be
holding our breath on that.

465
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,000
Beside, it has been easy
for Trump to stick by Myers,

466
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,480
hardly anyone has been
paying attention to this issue.

467
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:35,720
But we really should be.
I might know a way to help here.

468
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,520
What better way to illustrate
an abstract threat

469
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,560
than by learning from the company
that since the eighties has perfected

470
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,280
turning dry information into
state-of-the-art entertainment ?

471
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,400
Come with me !
Hi, there.

472
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,200
I would like to issue an important
warning for the DC area:

473
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,720
according to our patented
thousand-day forecast model,

474
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,640
Superstorm Barry is going to harm
the National Weather Service.

475
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,600
It originated over here
at AccuWeather headquarters

476
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,480
and has been gravitating towards
NOAA for nearly two years, now.

477
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,720
If it makes landfall,
there could be significant damage.

478
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,960
I'm talking mass reindeer suicide,
sliding Santa off a roof damage.

479
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,520
Because we do not want
the whole country

480
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,280
to be like Eddie Vedder,
in a position where,

481
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,320
unless we pay AccuWeather,
the next thing you know...

482
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,360
We're not alive !

483
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,600
We're not alive.

484
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,680
Superstorm Barry hitting
National Weather Service could cause

485
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,320
a massive data freeze,
while unfortunately,

486
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,160
over at AccuWeather there's gonna be
around a 95 per cent chance

487
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,480
of him making it rain.

488
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,320
That is our show. We're off next week,
we'll be back the week after that.

489
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,080
Goodnight ! I'm outta here !

490
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,680
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

491
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,760
END OF EPISODE 26,
SEASON VI
