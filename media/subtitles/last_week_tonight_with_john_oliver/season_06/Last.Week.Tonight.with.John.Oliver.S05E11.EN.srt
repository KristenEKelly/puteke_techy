John: Welcome, welcome,

4
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:19,219
welcome to "last week
tonight." I'm John Oliver.

5
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:27,961
Thank you so much
for joining us.

6
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,602
Just time for a quick
recap of the week,

7
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:40,572
which has been a busy one,
from Trump imposing tariffs on

8
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:43,342
Chinese goods to the attorney
general facing off with congress

9
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:46,145
in a borderline nstitional
crisis you've probably already

10
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:50,282
forgotten about to this: >>
Russian president Vladimir putin

11
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:54,353
tumbled to the ice while taking
a victory lap after playing a

12
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:55,020
hockey game.

13
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:58,757
Putin did not see a mat that
had been ld out on the ice.

14
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,826
I feel badly for
whoever put out the carpet.

15
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,094
I feel very badly.

16
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,529
Yeah, I wouldn't
want to be that guy.

17
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,863
John: Yeah,
'cause he's dead now.

18
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:07,166
That carpet guy is dead.

19
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,835
Probably rolled up
in that same carpet.

20
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:10,536
Why?

21
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:13,205
Because putin has people
killed and interferes in U.S.

22
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,506
Elections with no consequences.

23
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:17,776
But still, it was a fuclip
I liked it when he fell.

24
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:23,048
T inead of focusing on that, we
begin tonight closer to home in

25
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:26,251
Georgia, the state whose most
famous export is now shorthand

26
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,219
for butts.

27
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,456
And in case you're not
fluent in sex-related emojis,

28
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:33,592
I'll break it down for
you: A peach means a butt,

29
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,361
an eggplant means a penis,
a taco means a vagina,

30
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:39,998
water droplets mean ejaculate,
cherries mean testicles,

31
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:42,201
grapes mean a bun of fferent
testicles stuck together,

32
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:45,037
a tomato means a butt that's
been spray-painted red,

33
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,040
a baguette means a French penis,
a cucumber means a penis that

34
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,008
has been cut into
slices, and lastly,

35
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,411
a coconut means a coconut,
but one you can fuck.

36
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:53,078
Where was I?

37
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:53,745
Oh, right.

38
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:54,413
Georgia.

39
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,014
Earlier this ek, their
governor, Brian kemp,

40
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:59,885
signed a draconian bill which
would ban abortions after a

41
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:04,156
fetal heartbeat is detected,
which can be as early as six

42
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:08,026
weeks into a pregnancy, before
many women are even aware

43
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:08,794
they're pregnant.

44
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,896
And it doesn't stop there.

45
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,699
The bill gives a fetus
natural person status which

46
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,435
allows the fetus to be
entitled to child support,

47
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,704
claimed as a dependent
on tax returns,

48
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:21,306
and included in
Georgia's population.

49
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,176
Abortions will be allowed
only if a fetus has a fatal

50
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,845
deformity, the mother's
life is endangered,

51
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:31,617
or in rape and incest cases
where a police report was filed.

52
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:32,284
John: Okay.

53
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:35,988
Two things here: First, "tax
breaks begin at conception"

54
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,057
might be literally the most
republican law ever created.

55
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:42,127
And second, it's pretty
egregious to only make an

56
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:45,664
exception for rape or incest
"where a police report was file"

57
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,101
I guess that's to separate the
incest they're talking about

58
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,303
fromour n of the
mill cousin-fucking.

59
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:56,174
Or, as it's more commonly known,
"a giuliani marriage." And as if

60
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:59,444
the bill itself were
not crazy enough,

61
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,980
there were some spectacular
moments in the debate over it,

62
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:05,250
like this one from
representative Darlene Taylor.

63
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:10,255
Who speaks for
the baby named fetus?

64
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,591
Who speaks fothe by named fetus?

65
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:15,761
Well, today I'm going to.

66
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:20,766
To quote baby fetus, "I
deserve to have the right too.

67
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:24,336
Some may squirm in their
seats or turn their backs,

68
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:28,941
but I will speak today."
Baby fetus says, and I quote,

69
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,510
"I have that right.

70
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:37,649
Don't be afraid or intimidated
about acknowledging me." >>

71
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,051
John: Okay, let's
walk through this.

72
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,254
First, she explicitly says she's
speaking not on behalf of a

73
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:45,524
fetus, but on behalf of
baby whose name is fetus.

74
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,894
Then she's somehow quoting
this made-up baby fetus,

75
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,463
despite the fact that
babies can't speak or write,

76
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,932
so she has no source
mateal from which to quote.

77
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,668
I actually think my feelings
on this might be best summed up

78
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:00,939
baby fetus' seminal 1973
autobiography "all the things I

79
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,743
didn't say because I'm not
real." If I may quote baby

80
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,912
fetus, "a fetus is not a baby.

81
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,915
And, in fact, at six weeks,
a fetus isn't even a fetus.

82
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,284
It's an embryo the size
of a pomegranate seed.

83
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:15,621
Also, on an unrelated note, I
bet the sex that Jim and Pam

84
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,857
have is fine, but I bet the sex
that Pam and Roy used to have

85
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:19,524
was better.

86
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:23,095
This is the hill I would die
on were I not too fictional to

87
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:27,599
die." that's a direct quote
from baby fetus in 1973.

88
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,803
Now, I should note that this
law won't take effect in Georgia

89
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,873
till 2020 -- if it ever
does, because it's blatantly

90
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:35,907
unconstitutional.

91
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,877
But Georgia wasn't the only
state considering restrictive

92
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,012
abortion laws this week.

93
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,981
Alabama, the state whose flag
looks like their application to

94
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:47,252
be a state was rejected, is on
the verge of approving a bill

95
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:50,188
that would effectively ban most
abortions at every stage of

96
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,891
pregnancy, and doctors who
perform them could be charged

97
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:56,094
with a felony and face
up to 99 years in prison.

98
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,897
Meanwhile, Ohio -- which
already passed one of the cotry'

99
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,633
strictest abortion laws earlier
this year -- is now considering

100
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,703
putting more restrictions in
women's way: >> Lawmakers are

101
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,406
considering a bill that
would prohibit most insurance

102
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:11,176
companies from offering
coverage for abortion services.

103
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:14,513
It would include drugs or
devices used to prevent the

104
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,683
implementation of
a fertilized ovum.

105
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,952
John: So if that bill passes,
even women who do qualify for an

106
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,954
abortion may struggle
to pay for one.

107
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,790
At that point, why stop there?

108
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,459
Why not pass a bill saying, "all
women seeking an abortion in

109
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,562
Ohio must first tie up all the
remaining plot threads on "game

110
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:33,398
of thrones" in one single
episode of television.

111
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,268
Everyone knows that can't
be done, and frankly,

112
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,037
I feel terrible for any
network stupid enough to try.

113
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,541
Now some opponents have
expressed concern that bill

114
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,377
could also prevent insurance
companies from covering certain

115
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,547
forms of birth control and
contraception -- you know,

116
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,349
the things that help prevent
unwanted pregnancies --

117
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,118
something that
the bill's author,

118
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:56,655
representative John Becker,
does not seem to have given much

119
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:57,322
thought.

120
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,624
When we asked where
contraceptives like plan b and

121
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:03,095
the morning-after pill fall,
Becker said: >> I don't know

122
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:07,799
because I'm not smart enough to
know what causes abortions and

123
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,534
what doesn't.

124
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,803
The bill is just written
"if it causes an abortion,

125
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:15,974
"and people smarter than me
can figure out what that means.

126
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:16,641
John: Wow.

127
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,177
"I just wrote the bill, someone
smarter than me can figure out

128
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,280
what it means." It seems like
lawmakers should exhibit a

129
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,282
little more awareness of what
they're releasing than the

130
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,218
makers of the "Sonic
the hedgehog" movie.

131
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,955
"Look, I dunno, I just had the
cgi team mock up a furry potato

132
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:30,856
with a corpse's face.

133
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,825
Someone smarter than me can
figure out if that's nostalgic

134
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:37,629
for people." And look, I don't
know if the bill written by that

135
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,931
not-smart-enough-man who's
dressed like the devil in a

136
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,033
community theater
play will pass.

137
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:42,701
I don't know.

138
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:46,371
It's complete fucking
nonsense, so I'd hope not,

139
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:47,606
but you never know.

140
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,775
And if you're sensing a pattern
here, that might be because,

141
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:53,545
just this year, states have
introduced more than 250 bills

142
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,080
restricting abortion access.

143
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,250
It's pretty clear, with a
conservative supreme court,

144
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,952
lawmakers are taking every shot
they can to get a case that

145
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,788
might end up overturning roe v.

146
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,489
Wade, and they're
going to keep trying.

147
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,860
Which is why it's incumbent on
all of us to pay close attention

148
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:12,697
so if I may address those
lawmakers in the words of an

149
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,633
unexpectedly literate
baby, "listen,

150
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:19,471
I'm not a constitutional scholar
-- I'm not anything -- but if I

151
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,507
were, I'd tell you that laws
like these deny women agency

152
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:25,710
over their own bodies, and your
actions put their health and

153
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:26,511
lives at risk.

154
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,414
But hey, why not ask the women
affected what they think,

155
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,650
because they're actual
people, unlike me,

156
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:36,656
a fucking fictional baby
named fetus." And now this.

171
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,153
Moving on.

172
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:20,992
Our main story tonight concerns
earth, which, for the record,

173
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,560
is not flat.

174
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:24,562
Earth is, of
course, cylindrical.

175
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:27,799
That's why we can both see the
curve of the horizon and fall

176
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
off the edge of the planet.

177
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,368
It's just science, everyone.

178
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,370
That's a science fact.

179
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,839
Specifically, we want to talk
about the challenges facing the

180
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,609
environment, and often when
the subject comes up on TV,

181
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,112
the solution is presented as a
bunch of fun recycling ideasike

182
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:44,215
this: >> So we're having an
earth day birthday party.

183
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:47,452
So, check this one out, your
old garden hoses -- do you love

184
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:48,320
these little baskets?

185
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:48,987
Oh!

186
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:49,654
Baskets!

187
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:50,322
Oh, that's cute.

188
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:50,989
So easy to make.

189
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,926
No special tools, it's
just a hose and zip ties.

190
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,593
That's it.

191
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:57,228
Oh, my gosh!

192
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,263
John: Oh, my gosh.

193
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:02,701
It's weird to see a grown adult
be that excited by some garden

194
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,736
ses ed together with zip ties.

195
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,806
Although I have to admit,
it's pretty fucking awesome.

196
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:12,243
I mean, I had this old garden
hose lying around my living room

197
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:15,613
for ages, and I had no
idea what to do with it.

198
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:18,883
Now it's a basket I use for
all those picnics I attend!

199
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:22,354
I love it, and I wish to be
buried with my hose basket.

200
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:27,359
Unfortunately, fun, crafty tips
like those clearly aren't doing

201
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,927
enough to save our planet.

202
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,029
These days, we're
inundated with new,

203
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,098
terrifying headlines
on a regular basis,

204
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:36,167
including a landmark report
from the united nations panel on

205
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:40,105
climate change just last fall
that contained some devastating

206
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,239
conclusions.

207
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,475
The scientists found that
if greenhouse gas emissions

208
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,745
continue at the current rate,
we could start seeing worsening

209
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:51,182
food shortages and wildfires and
a mass dieoff of coral reefs as

210
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,185
soon as 2040.

211
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,622
John: 2040 -- that's
just 21 years from now!

212
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:01,126
By that point, Finn
wolfhard will only be 37,

213
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:05,096
Ariana grande will only be 46,
and Lou dobbs will only have

214
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,731
been dead for 30 years.

215
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:11,603
So to have any hope of
avoiding those consequences,

216
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,205
the report found that
unprecedented efforts are going

217
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:17,342
to be required, and to that end,
there's one recent proposal that

218
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,476
gets discussed a lot.

219
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:21,846
Here are a few of the times it
was mentioned just in the past

220
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,081
week.

221
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,416
She backs the green new deal.

222
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,317
The green new
deal makes no sense.

223
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,186
How do you achieve
the green new deal?

224
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,654
Factor in the new green deal.

225
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:30,889
Green new deal.

226
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,589
Green new deal.

227
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,824
A green new deal.

228
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,225
Green new deal.

229
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,960
The green n deal.

230
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,729
The green new deal.

231
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,197
The green new deal.

232
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,965
[Crowd booing] >> John: If you
knew nothing else about the

233
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,701
green new deal, you now know
that everyone's talking about

234
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:46,571
it, and it was booed at a Trump
rally, therefore it's a, famous,

235
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,573
and b, probably good.

236
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:52,610
And again, all those
clips were from this week,

237
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,746
which is pretty amazing
considering the fact that the

238
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:58,083
senate voted the green new
deal down six week ago.

239
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:58,783
Think about that.

240
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:02,320
How often do we talk about
legislation after congress votes

241
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:02,987
it down?

242
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:06,024
How often do we talk about
legislation before congress

243
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:06,891
votes it down?

244
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,195
We talk out gislation about as
much as we talked about "suits"

245
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,263
before we knew who
Meghan markle was.

246
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:16,034
You weren't talking about
"suits." You didn't go to the

247
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,569
water cooler and
say, "hey, Fred,

248
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,404
you catch 'suits'
the other night?

249
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:23,708
That Harvey specter as portrayed
by Gabriel macht sure is a piece

250
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:24,509
of work, eh?

251
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,710
On 'suits'?"

252
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:29,781
On the TV program 'suits' that
has captured my imagination?"

253
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:34,486
And the green new deal has
been famously polarizing.

254
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,855
On the one hand, all these
senators running for president

255
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:37,789
co-sponsored it.

256
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,025
On the other hand, Republicans
have been foaming at the mouth

257
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:44,863
to criticize it for all the
crazy provisions they insist it

258
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:49,501
he so-called green new deal
proposes the elimination of air

259
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,168
travel.

260
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:55,106
Eliminating cars,
airplanes, flatulent cows, and,

261
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,675
for good measure, tearing
down all of our buildings.

262
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,178
You can't stop
cows from flatulating,

263
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,581
you gotta eliminate cows, which
means they're comin' after our

264
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:04,849
hamburgers, congressman.

265
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,085
They want to take
away your hamburgers.

266
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:12,023
This is what Stalin dreamt
about but never achieved.

267
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,325
John: What are
you talking about?

268
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,427
That's not Stalin's dream.

269
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,163
That is the hamburglar's dream.

270
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:22,100
You're confusing Stalin
with the hamburglar.

271
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,802
Which is actually
understandable.

272
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:27,005
One said "the state is an
instrument in the hands of the

273
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:31,142
ruling class" while the other
said "robble robble." You know,

274
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,510
similar vibes, but you
know, similar vibes,

275
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:33,178
subtle differences.

276
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,881
So given that the green new deal
is still very much on people's

277
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:40,418
minds, we thought it'd be worth
taking a look tonight at what it

278
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:43,454
is, what it isn't,
and most importantly,

279
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:44,889
where we should
maybe go from here.

280
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,925
And the first thing to
understand is that the green new

281
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:50,361
deal doesn't even mention the
word "cows" or "airplanes." In

282
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:52,764
fact, while it's sometimes
discsed ke it's filled with

283
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,800
specific programs to fight
climate change, it isn't.

284
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:59,437
It's a non-binding resolution
that very briefly sets out some

285
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:02,607
extremely aggressive goals,
including achieving net-zero

286
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,410
greenhouse gas emissions,
meeting 100% of the country's

287
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,612
power demand through
clean, renewable,

288
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,314
and zero-emission
energy sources,

289
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:12,383
and creating millions of good,
high-wage jobs in the united

290
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,051
states.

291
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,421
The whole green new deal
is just 14 pages long.

292
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:19,924
That is 7 seven pages shorter
than the menu for the cheesecake

293
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:23,161
factory -- a menu
which, by the way,

294
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,496
should have exactly
one thg ont: Pie.

295
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,098
That's right, I said it.

296
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,967
Pie is the only good dessert.

297
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:29,801
It's got fruit.

298
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:30,568
It's got bread.

299
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:31,269
It's got goo.

300
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,238
It is a true triple threat.

301
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,206
Fuck you, cakes.

302
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,507
Pie forever!

303
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:40,511
I do not yield any ground.

304
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,948
But it's important to note,
the green new deal contains no

305
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,951
specifics on w it will
achieve any of its goals,

306
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:50,154
which sounds like a criticism,
but it is really not.

307
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:53,057
The plan's backers, led by
Alexandria ocasio-Cortez,

308
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:57,061
said repeatedly, right from the
outsetthathe green new deal was

309
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,564
merely meant to kick-start
a conversation -- set some

310
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:03,635
aggressive targets, so we could
then figure out how to hit them.

311
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:08,506
Our first step is to define
the problem and define the scope

312
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:12,644
of the solution, and so
we're here to say that small

313
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:16,881
incremental policy
solutions are not enough.

314
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:17,548
John: Right.

315
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,118
At a certain point, your
problems get so big that you

316
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,420
have no choice but
to do methg drastic.

317
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,255
Sometimes you just
get in too deep.

318
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,857
Sometimes you make a
young man's mistake,

319
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,259
like falling in love with the
beautiful wife of a mafioso.

320
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,462
He puts a price on your head,
she swears she'll leave him for

321
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,798
you, but you can't do that,
can't make her live the life of

322
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,334
a fugitive, so you fake your
own death in a falafel cart

323
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,770
collision and sail to America
to start things fresh.

324
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,072
You tell everyone there you
were a comedian in england,

325
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,742
and despite your ridiculous
cartoon accent and no one in

326
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:48,046
england having ever heard of
you, nobody really questions it.

327
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,947
And it's a kind of
life, I suppose,

328
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:52,583
eking out a living reading off
stats and jokes once a week on

329
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:55,887
premium cable, but not a night
goes by you don't dream of the

330
00:15:55,888 --> 00:16:01,426
white sardinian sands and
the soft lips of Isabella.

331
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,895
♪ ♪ Just an example.

332
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:08,901
Just an example off
the top of my head.

333
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,605
So the green new deal was ant
to be a conversation starter.

334
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,875
But unless you like bad faith
conversations about farting

335
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,845
cows, that conversation
has not gone well so far.

336
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,947
And much of that was
clearly inevitable.

337
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:25,950
There were people who were never
going to support this plan.

338
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,386
But there were also some
self-inflicted wounds.

339
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,622
The reason you hear hamburgers
come up so much is that aoc's

340
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:35,993
office mistakenly sent an early
draft of an faq to reporters

341
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:39,997
containg lguage like "we set a
goal to get to net-zero rather

342
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:43,101
than zero emissions in ten years
because we aren't sure that

343
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,703
we'll be able to fully get rid
of farting cows and airplanes

344
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,639
that fast," which is clearly
supposed to be a joke,

345
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,209
but it wasn't a great
time to attempt one.

346
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:55,179
And even aoc admits the rollout
of the green new deal was "the

347
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,316
biggest mistake she's made in
congress." And shs right about

348
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:01,753
that, because it gave an opening
for these idiots to pretend the

349
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,922
green new deal was all about
hamburger stealing when it is

350
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:05,590
not.

351
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,926
Although, for the record, there
are real environmental issues

352
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:12,330
surrounding cattle farming --
among them that cows do emit a

353
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,365
lot of methane, which
is a greenhouse gas.

354
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,568
Although even there, is a
slight although even there,

355
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,404
there's a slight misconception
about which end of the cow is

356
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,071
most responsible.

357
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:22,573
First, I want to correct a
misnomer that cows don't fart,

358
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,742
they actually belch.

359
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:25,610
John: It's true.

360
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:29,580
Most cow methane comes from
them belching, not farting.

361
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:33,985
And if you only remember one
fact from tonight's show,

362
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:37,488
please do not let
it be that one.

363
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:38,156
Please.

364
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,857
Just forget that now.

365
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,727
But while the rollout of this
conversation has been bumpy,

366
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,696
it it is great that the green
new deal has started one.

367
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,933
So let's talk about what a plan
to combat combat change could

368
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:49,600
look like.

369
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,269
And the first thing
to understand is,

370
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,705
no one solution is going
to be nearly enough here.

371
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,874
We need to tace th
from multiple angles,

372
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,910
and there are lots
of ideas out there,

373
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,112
including building
a better power grid,

374
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:04,215
improving battery storage,
developing low-carbon jet fuel,

375
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,850
electrifying
industrial processes,

376
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,286
blding cities more
densely, phasing out hfcs,

377
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,055
developing lab-grown meat,
building better nuclear plants,

378
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,090
upgrading our thermostats,
increasing mass transit

379
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:15,526
ridership, and scaling up
carbon capture technology.

380
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,195
And I could talk
about all of those,

381
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,797
but it would take all night,
and I know you want to watch the

382
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,633
rerun of "game of thrones" so
you can see what garbage from

383
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,936
craft services they've hidden
as an easter egg this week!

384
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:25,603
There!

385
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,637
Right there!

386
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:30,608
Those pringles aren't
supposed to be there!

387
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:35,780
They don't have that type
of pringles in Westeros!

388
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,916
That's ridiculous!

389
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:43,321
So instead, let's focus on one
policy that you're likely to

390
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,790
hear about as this
conversation continues,

391
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,425
and that's carbon pricing.

392
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,261
The current situation
with carbon is critical.

393
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:54,365
Carbon emissions are, by far,
the largest source of greenhouse

394
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:58,436
gases, yet right now, it's
basically free to pollute the

395
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,239
air with carbon dioxide,
which is a little weird.

396
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,474
We've universally
agreed polluting is bad,

397
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,744
and yet it's fr to it.

398
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,913
When you litter, you pay a fine.

399
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,682
When you drive above the
speed limit, you pay a fine.

400
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:15,119
When you steal 400 hamsters from
petsmart, tie them to a sled,

401
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,255
and race through the
streets on a hamster sleigh,

402
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,322
you pay a fine.

403
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,624
Is that fine worth it?

404
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,625
Yes, of course it is.

405
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,294
But you pay it.

406
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,530
Now, carbon pricing is
a little complicated,

407
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,032
so to break down
the logic behind it,

408
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,868
I've enlisted the help of a
guy who's made a career of

409
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:34,639
explaining complex ideas
with fun, visual stunts.

410
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,306
Hi, John.

411
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:36,741
Bill nye the science guy here.

412
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:40,444
I'm going to explain the
complicated logic behind carbon

413
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,112
pricing.

414
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,481
But rst, safety glasses on.

415
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:48,452
When something costs more,
people buy less of it.

416
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,288
Safety glasses off.

417
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,790
That's it.

418
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,926
John: That's it?

419
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,060
Oh.

420
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,329
Honestly, I was expecting
something bit re fun and visual

421
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,630
than that, bill.

422
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,732
Could you maybe explain the
long-term impact of carbon

423
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:05,636
pricing, maybe with a cool stunt
to jazz up what you're saying?

424
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,138
Go on.

425
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,273
Okay, safety glasses on.

426
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:13,611
When we release carbon -- s, by
burning coal or driving an SUV

427
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:17,815
-- all of us pay for that, in
the form of things like fires,

428
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,717
floods, and crop failures.

429
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:24,722
Putting a fee on carbon creates
incentives to emit less carbon.

430
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,959
Incentivizes the development
of low-carbon technology.

431
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,062
Which is huge, because that's
vital to reducing emissions

432
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:31,729
globally.

433
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,431
And because, for
some reason, John,

434
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:36,801
you're a 42-year-old man o
needs s attention sustained with

435
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:42,873
tricks, here's some fucking
mentos in a bottle of diet coke.

436
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,009
Happy now?

437
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,178
John: Yes, I am happy!

438
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,779
I am happy!

439
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,915
The coke went high!

440
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,584
The mentos made it fizzy!

441
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,186
I love it!

442
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,221
I love it, bill!

443
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:57,888
I love it!

444
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:58,556
I love it!

445
00:20:58,557 --> 00:20:59,223
I love it!

446
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:05,229
But his point about
incentivizing new technology is

447
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,764
important.

448
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,233
Because our current low-carbon
technology strategy is,

449
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:12,637
essentially, "hope this guy
stops calling people pedophiles

450
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,439
long enough to invent an
affordable electric car." And

451
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,676
right now, the pedophile-to-car
balance is way off.

452
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:24,348
So, in theory, putting a price
on carbon makes total sense.

453
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,951
And you should know there's
absolutely nothing extreme about

454
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,618
this idea.

455
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,821
Economists across thpolitical
spectrum support it,

456
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,591
and more than 40 governments
worldwide have done it,

457
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,961
including in the u.K., where
carbon pricing has contributed

458
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:41,332
to co2 emissions falling to
their lowest level since 1890.

459
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,366
That's right.

460
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:45,536
The lowest level since before
Mary poppins danced with chimney

461
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:48,472
sweeps and introduced the
banks children to cocaine.

462
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,675
Yes, cocaine.

463
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:53,844
You thought the spoonful of
sugar was actually sugar?

464
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:54,612
Come on!

465
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,615
How do you explain
the dancing penguins?

466
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,483
She gave those children cocaine!

467
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,519
And she changed
their lives forever.

468
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,525
Now, there are different ways
to put a price on carbon.

469
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:11,762
One is cap and trade, where
you cap the total amount of

470
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:15,032
emissions companies are allowed
to release and let them trade

471
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,201
emsions permits
among themselves.

472
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:19,804
Or there's the more
straightforward carbon tax,

473
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:23,340
which just adds a surcharge to
activities that emit carbon.

474
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:26,477
The problem there is
mostly the word "tax,

475
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,713
"which is a dirty
word in politics.

476
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,214
Just look at what
happened in Canada,

477
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:33,184
which rolled out a new carbon
tax that went into effect just

478
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,018
last month.

479
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,420
Although it wasn't
easy to do that.

480
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,657
Justin trudeau desperately
tried not to use the word tax,

481
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,126
instead calling it a
"price on pollution,

482
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:46,430
"and when he slipped up once,
just look how people reacted.

483
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:51,436
What we are also guaranteeing
is that this tax -- [crowd

484
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:00,145
shouting] This, uh, price
on carbon will be -- [crowd

485
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,252
Shouting] >> John: Listen to the
level of excitement over that

486
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:09,220
slip-up.

487
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,823
If you're a politician, you
just can't say the word "tax,

488
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,925
"in the same way that if you're
an actor you can't say the word

489
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:17,194
"MacBeth," and if you're the
president of the United States,

490
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:20,631
you can't say the word
"origins." >> I hope they now go

491
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:25,736
and take look at the oranges --
the oranges of thenvestigaon --

492
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:29,140
the beginnings of
the investigation.

493
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,842
John: It's funny 'cause his
brain is turning into pudding.

494
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:35,279
Anyway, the int, trudeau
simply saying the word "tax" was

495
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,417
described as "trudeau trips on
his own words." So on one level,

496
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:43,888
you can kind of understand his
reluctance to use that term,

497
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:46,791
because it exposed him to
fearmongering about what his

498
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,392
policy would mean
for gular people,

499
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:51,996
which sometimes took the form
of catchy slam poetry from his

500
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,597
political opponents.

501
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,733
We can't afford
this onerous fee.

502
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,302
11 cents more for
a liter of fuel,

503
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,771
taxing me and my ks' school.

504
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:04,041
Farms and families will feel the
pinch when the carbon tax man

505
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:04,942
pulls the cinch.

506
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,812
Tax the tractor, combine, plow.

507
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,880
Tax the chicken, egg, and cow.

508
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,849
Carbon tax man, enough's enough.

509
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,153
Don't cat-tax Canadians
on all their stuff.

510
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,490
John: Fire.

511
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,860
Look, I don't care where
you stand on this issue,

512
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:27,298
no one wants to hear a rhyme
about carbon taxes from anybody,

513
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,267
let alone some guy who looks
like he got his entire wardrobe

514
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:35,273
at not a fan. Ohn Oliver." But
he is speaking to a real concern

515
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,376
there.

516
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:43,447
How do y -- now you see it.

517
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:45,716
Now you can't unsee it.

518
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:50,722
How do you put a price on carbon
and make things more expensive,

519
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,025
without harming the people
who can least afford it?

520
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,761
And what Canada's doing to
address this is pretty simple:

521
00:24:57,762 --> 00:25:00,431
Very basically, they're taking
the money they collect and

522
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,765
giving it back to
their citizens.

523
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,435
They're doing this by pooling
the money gathered by increased

524
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:07,238
fees on things like gas
and heat, dividing it up,

525
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:10,341
and sending it back to
taxpayers as a rebate.

526
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,910
In fact, they've designed it so
that the rebates in Canada are

527
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:16,280
anticipated to exceed the
increased costs for about 70% of

528
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:20,284
households, with lowest-income
households seeing the most

529
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,418
benefits from the policy.

530
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:22,119
Which is great.

531
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,123
But even with that being true,
the fight over a carbon tax was,

532
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,726
and still is,
difficult in Canada.

533
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:32,663
It's no wonder some politicians
in this country are wary of even

534
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,598
attempting a debate
about carbon pricing.

535
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:37,134
In fact, the last serious
attempt that got any real

536
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:40,437
traction was ten years ago,
when congress tried passing a

537
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:44,074
cap-and-trade bill, and
the debate got so toxic,

538
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,343
West Virginia democrat Joe
manchin was comfortable

539
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:50,080
expressing his displeasure like
this: >> I'm Joe manchin and I

540
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:53,117
approve this ad because I'll
always defend West Virginia.

541
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:57,121
I sued epa, and I
will take dead aim...

542
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,123
[Gunshot] At the
cap-and-trade bill,

543
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:02,726
'cause it's bad
for West Virginia.

544
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:07,164
John: Now that may seem
idiotic, because it is,

545
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:10,601
but in fairness, that is the
only way to stop a bill from

546
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:11,268
becoming a law.

547
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,703
That bill had a knife!

548
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,171
That bill had a knife!

549
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,339
You all saw it!

550
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,573
You all saw it!

551
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,042
It reached for its pocket.

552
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:22,613
Look, look, look, I know
this can all seem hopeless,

553
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,515
especially under the
current administration,

554
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,818
but there are actually some
small signs that the tide may be

555
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:28,652
turning.

556
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:32,189
The very fact we're still
talking about the green new deal

557
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,357
is really encouraging.

558
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:36,560
Plus, the percentage of
conservative Republicans who say

559
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:39,496
they are "very" or "somewhat"
worried by global warming has

560
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,699
more than doubled in
the last five years.

561
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,336
Even Mitch McConnell finally
acknowledged the role of humans

562
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,805
in altering the climate for
the first time a few weeks ago.

563
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,641
And yes, it's a bit like
giving a speech titled,

564
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:53,344
"alf actually just a big
puppet." I mean, yeah, Mitch,

565
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:58,148
it's barrsing it's taken
you this long to accept it.

566
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:01,452
But better late
than never, I guess.

567
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:05,589
And however bumpy its
rollout was, to its credit,

568
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,592
the green new deal has
succeeded in gettinpeop talking.

569
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:12,029
But that won't mean anything
unless that talk now turns to

570
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,830
actions.

571
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,733
And putting a price on carbon
could potentially be one of

572
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:16,400
them.

573
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,969
Although -- let me reiterate --
it won't be enough on its own,

574
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,337
by a long shot.

575
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:23,173
We're going to need a lot of
different policies working in

576
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:25,843
tandem and we have to
take action right now.

577
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:28,946
But you don't have
to take that from me.

578
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:33,117
Instead, I'm happy to say that
bill nye has agreed to help

579
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:37,621
drive the urgency home by
actually doing one of his

580
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:39,590
enjoyable light-hearted
demonstrations.

581
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:43,327
So, bill -- please -- do you
have a fun experiment for us?

582
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,497
Here, I've got an
experiment for you.

583
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,766
Safety glasses on.

584
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:51,135
By the end of this century,
if emissions keep rising,

585
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:54,004
the average temperature on earth
could go up another four to

586
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:54,838
eight grees.

587
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,008
What I'm saying is, the
planet's on fucking fire.

588
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:01,211
There are lots of things
we can do to put it out.

589
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:02,880
Are any of them free?

590
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:03,914
No, of course not!

591
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,149
Nothing's free, you idiots!

592
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,216
Grow the fuck up!

593
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:07,384
You're not children anymore.

594
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:10,187
I didn't mind explaining
photosynthesis to you when you

595
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:14,158
were 12, but you're adults now,
and this is an actual crisis.

596
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,528
Got it safety glasses
off, motherfuckers.

597
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:22,533
John: I think we've
all broken bill nye.

598
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:27,738
And I, for one, am absolutely
on board with his new,

599
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:28,939
gritty reboot.

600
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,941
That's our show, thanks
so much for watching.

601
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:31,708
See you next week.

602
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:32,376
Good night!

603
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:37,382
[Cheers and applause]
