1
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,480
Welcome, welcome, welcome to
Last Week Tonight.

2
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,320
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

3
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,360
Just time for a quick recap
of the week,

4
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,000
which was a busy one
for the president,

5
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,200
who oversaw the largest
single-state ICE raid in US history,

6
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,640
retweeted conspiracy theories
about the death of Jeffrey Epstein,

7
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,440
and visited the sites of last week's
mass shootings,

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,840
which went exactly
as well as you'd expect.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,560
Some of President Trump's
own aides are conceding

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,040
his visits to two cities in mourning
didn't go as planned

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,320
after new video shows him
bragging about

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,400
crowd sizes
while at a hospital in El Paso.

13
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,640
I was here three months ago,
we made a speech

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,120
and we had a...
what was the name of the arena ?

15
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,080
That place was packed, right ?
That was some crowd.

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,600
And we had twice
the number outside.

17
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,320
And then you had this crazy Beto.

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,560
Beto had, like, 400 people
in a parking lot

19
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,080
and they said his crowd
was wonderful.

20
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,120
Wow. Look, we all know
how much Trump struggles

21
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,400
to do the bare minimum
of being a president,

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,160
but it's still genuinely shocking
just how much he struggles

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,880
to do the bare minimum
of being a fucking person.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,360
Because... just consider the thought
process that happened there.

25
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,080
He visited a hospital filled
with victims of a mass shooting

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,000
and thought to himself,
"Remember that other time"

27
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,480
"when I was the center of attention
and it was better ?"

28
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,760
And then he thought, "Do you think
anyone else remembers that ?"

29
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,800
Then he thought,
"I should remind them, right ?"

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,360
Then he thought, "Great idea."

31
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,880
Then he thought, "Thank you !"

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,200
Then he thought, "Ivanka."

33
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,960
Then he thought, "No time !"

34
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,760
And then he said it.
And he was happy with how it sounded.

35
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,000
But Trump's pathological lack
of empathy

36
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,640
should not distract us from
the important question right now,

37
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,880
which is: what action,
if any, will be taken on guns ?

38
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,560
Because while you're kind of
conditioned at this point to think,

39
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,440
"absolutely none,"
pressure is building.

40
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,440
When Ohio governor
Mike DeWine spoke

41
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,160
at a vigil following
the Dayton shooting,

42
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,120
the crowd made it painfully clear
that they wanted action.

43
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,320
What we do tonight
by this amazing crowd

44
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,120
is to say to them
that we love you.

45
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,520
Do something !
Do something !

46
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,120
You know you're doing a bad job
when people are yelling,

47
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,720
"Do something" at you.

48
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,880
Not even,
"Try a different position !"

49
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,960
or "Like that, but to the left !"

50
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,360
Just "Do something,"
the universal complaint

51
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,560
for men putting in less
than zero percent everywhere.

52
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,480
So it is pretty clear that support
for meaningful gun reform is there.

53
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,560
But as always,
a key obstacle is the NRA,

54
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,520
an organization whose former
president once famously said

55
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,800
you can have his gun when you
pry it from his cold dead hands

56
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,840
and, you know, guess what,
I fucking did.

57
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,480
So, what are you gonna do
about it, Charlton ? Shoot me ?

58
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,480
With what, you dead idiot ?

59
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,560
The NRA has successfully fought
legislation for decades now.

60
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,920
Although it's currently in the midst
of an internal shit show.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,440
It all started last year,
when federal investigators

62
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,720
started looking
into whether a Russian agent

63
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,040
had used the NRA
to infiltrate Republican politics.

64
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,200
Which is already
comfortably bad enough.

65
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,000
But then the New York state AG

66
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,200
started looking into
their tax-exempt status.

67
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,360
Because the NRA
is technically a non-profit.

68
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,880
And it turns out, there's been
some very suspicious expenditures.

69
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,120
In May, leaked documents showed

70
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,040
the group's long-time leader,
Wayne LaPierre,

71
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,560
may have misused member dues,

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,080
spending nearly
$300,000 on designer clothes.

73
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,720
$300,000 on clothes ?
This guy ? How ?

74
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,040
Wayne LaPierre appears
to only own a single suit.

75
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,920
Here is what he wore to CPAC in 2018.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,440
Here's what he wore to CPAC in 2017.

77
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,880
Although in 2016, to be fair,
he did shake it up and wore this.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,600
I'm kidding, I'm clearly
just kidding. It was obviously this.

79
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,760
And look: if you are going to blow
that much money on clothes,

80
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,320
at least make more interesting
choices than dressing

81
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,760
like the head coach of the opposing
team in a "Mighty Ducks" movie.

82
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,200
And it wasn't just suits,
there were also allegations

83
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,760
of misspending
on lavish travel expenses.

84
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,680
All of which was infuriating
for many NRA members and employees,

85
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,480
since the organization
has been running deficits

86
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,720
of as much
as forty million dollars,

87
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,000
and has even eliminated free coffee
at its headquarters

88
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,800
and frozen
the employees' pension plan.

89
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,040
And things got even worse
this week, when this story broke.

90
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,640
The CEO of the NRA, Wayne LaPierre,
wanted the gun lobby

91
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,400
to buy him
a $6 million house in Texas

92
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,280
in part over fears for his safety

93
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,960
after the Parkland School
shooting last year.

94
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,600
Wow. So, putting aside the head of
the NRA claiming he needs a mansion

95
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,800
because other people got shot,
the house in question is ludicrous.

96
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,160
Because the NRA didn't buy it,
so it's still listed on Zillow.

97
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,480
Which is how we know it contains
four bedrooms and nine bathrooms.

98
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,320
Which is objectively
too many bathrooms.

99
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,280
Especially considering
one of them is this one.

100
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,320
And what the fuck
is happening there ?

101
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,400
That is a bathtub staged
like a community theater.

102
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,600
How is that
even supposed to work ?

103
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,520
I mean, I suppose you could sit
naked in that tub

104
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,920
while two people sit with their backs
to you reading

105
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,520
or as it's known in England,
a threesome.

106
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,440
But otherwise, that's an inexplicable
setup for a bathroom.

107
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,360
And as if all this weren't enough,

108
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,080
board members
are also now questioning

109
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,600
the large amount paid to the group's
ad agency, Ackerman McQueen,

110
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,880
which was responsible
for creating and running NRA TV.

111
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,840
We actually talked
about it last year.

112
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,640
And there was always
something weird going on there,

113
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,200
because its shows looked both
expensive and made for no one.

114
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,200
And while NRA TV has since been
shut down, there is a part of me,

115
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,800
the part that's lying,
that will really miss it.

116
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,480
Because it means there will be no
more episodes of my favorite shows,

117
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,280
like "Love At First Shot,"
a show aimed at women,

118
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,440
where one episode was focused on the
most stylish way to concealed carry.

119
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,600
So today, you're gonna be given
a challenge of finding two outfits.

120
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,160
And you're gonna be judged
on four different criteria.

121
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,000
Concealability; how well
you can conceal your firearm.

122
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,000
Practicality; are you actually
gonna wear these clothes

123
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,480
that we're gonna buy today ?

124
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,720
- Style.
- So nice.

125
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,480
If it gets hot during the day,
I just can take off the back piece

126
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,280
and still be concealing
and everything.

127
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,160
And where are you carrying ?

128
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,400
So, I definitely am
carrying at the waist.

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
- But, I have another option too.
- Oh, very nice, yeah.

130
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,960
- And carrying under the arm, too.
- Perfect, nice.

131
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,760
I mean, you have to admit
that outfit is versatile.

132
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,120
You can totally see her going
to the mall, going to drinks,

133
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,760
and, with those guns, then going
to kill the entire Blue Man Group.

134
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,520
Now, obviously, the death
of NRA TV is a tragedy,

135
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,960
thoughts and prayers
to all those affected.

136
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,720
But the bottom line here is that
for the first time in a while

137
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,120
things are not actually
looking great for the NRA.

138
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,760
So, does this mean that
gun control could finally happen ?

139
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,480
Mitch McConnell has hinted
at action on background checks.

140
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,320
But he's also refused to recall
the Senate and might well be hoping

141
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,920
that by the time it's back in
session, the pressure will be off.

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,480
Meanwhile, the president has said

143
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,320
that he's willing to stand up
to the NRA.

144
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,800
But he's also, one, a liar,
and two, likely to identify

145
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,760
with an organization that has spent
itself into colossal debt,

146
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,520
has troubling ties to Russia,

147
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,680
and is associated with shitty TV
programs and very bad taste.

148
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,480
I guess what I'm really
saying here is,

149
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,880
a weakened NRA is nice, sure,

150
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,440
but the only way things
are really going to change

151
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,160
is if lawmakers continue
to feel the pressure to,

152
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,400
and if I may quote that Ohio crowd,
"do something."

153
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,880
And now this.

154
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,800
And Now: The Pointless But Somehow
Mesmerizing Play-By-Play

155
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,200
Of The 51st Annual Stone Skipping
Competition.

156
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,280
All right, our first skipper today is
Kurt "The Mountain Man" Steiner.

157
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,680
- Lot of pitty-pats, there.
- Very nice pitty-pats.

158
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,280
Next up is
John "The Sheriff" Kolar.

159
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,280
"The Sherriff ?"
Is he a real sheriff ?

160
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,360
No, that's his nickname.

161
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,480
Did they ever think of taking
their shoes off

162
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,600
before they go
into the water ?

163
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,240
No, because they're afraid they're
gonna slip on the rocks out there.

164
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,480
- On the algae that grows on 'em.
- Shorts might have been a good call.

165
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,640
We have Max
"Top Gun" Steiner.

166
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,200
He learned most of what he got
from Russ "Rock Bottom" Byars.

167
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,760
Listen, these are special stones.

168
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,800
They're not just bending
over and picking up a stone.

169
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,120
These are stones these guys
probably have slept with.

170
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,240
There's a skip, there's a nice skip.

171
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,720
Nice skip, nice skip !

172
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,440
Whoa, there is a skip !
Came out of nowhere.

173
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,880
- Max, how do you feel ?
- Like a champion.

174
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,440
Feel good about it.
I don't know what else to say.

175
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,440
Moving on. Our main story tonight,
concerns the country of Turkmenistan,

176
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,160
and specifically, its president,
Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov.

177
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,560
That is not to be confused

178
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,680
with the Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov
that you went to high school with

179
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,880
or the one that was dating
Taylor Swift over the summer.

180
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,280
No, we're talking about this
Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov.

181
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,160
He's actually been
in the news a bit recently,

182
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,480
after rumors circulated
that he'd died,

183
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,880
something his government
pushed back on hard,

184
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,640
first insisting
that he was merely on vacation,

185
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,760
then releasing a 25-minute video
to state TV

186
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,680
showing everything
he was supposedly doing,

187
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,600
from bowling to working out
with his friends, to this.

188
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,480
As we know, our dear leader is very
skillful in controlling a sports car.

189
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,920
He rode his powerful off-road car
around the crater

190
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,600
and demonstrated his high
professional driving skills.

191
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,520
Well, count me convinced,
that guy is clearly alive and well.

192
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,960
You can't do donuts around
a flaming pit if you're dead.

193
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,960
Think about all the people
who are dead right now,

194
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,360
Babe Ruth, Galileo,
Marlon Brando,

195
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,880
Mother Theresa,
the original Paul McCartney,

196
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,880
do you see any of them
doing donuts around fire pits ?

197
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,280
Of course you don't,
you have to be alive.

198
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,720
Now, if Berdimuhamedov
looks a bit familiar at all to you,

199
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,560
we've actually mentioned him
before on this show,

200
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,200
during our segment on authoritarian
governments last year,

201
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,680
when we showed you this clip of him
being a literal strong man.

202
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,960
Look, I hate to say this to a fellow
lifter, but that shit's weak, bro.

203
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,560
You did one rep, and there weren't
even weights on the bar.

204
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,680
Even when I'm tapering,
I stack more plate than an omakase.

205
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,960
My body's stuck on beast mode,
and there's no off switch.

206
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,520
You want to know how I got
these two boulder shoulders ?

207
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,920
By putting in my time
at my fortress of swole-itude.

208
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,120
I'm just saying, bro, take notes,

209
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,000
'cause I burst out of suits
like I'm Meghan Markle.

210
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,760
And look, make no mistake:

211
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,160
Berdimuhamedov is even worse
at ruling a country

212
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,600
than he is at pushing plate.

213
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,560
He is a fierce authoritarian
and, according to Human Rights Watch,

214
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,840
"Turkmenistan remains"

215
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,920
"one of the world's most closed
and oppressively governed countries,"

216
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,280
or as one NGO researcher put it...

217
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,760
I would say it's probably one of the
worst places to live in the world.

218
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,880
Absolutely no freedom of the press,

219
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,400
absolutely no way you can voice
any kind of opinion.

220
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,480
It is still virtually a police state.

221
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,640
"One of the worst places on earth."

222
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,000
That is quite a claim, especially
considering the earth also includes

223
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,600
Syria, North Korea
and Twitter.

224
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,200
And it's not just a lack
of freedom of speech,

225
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,000
there've also been
State Department reports of

226
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,080
"arbitrary arrest and detention,
endemic corruption and forced labor."

227
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,320
So, he's a dangerous world leader.

228
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,320
But that is not the reason
that we're talking about him.

229
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,960
After all: dangerous world leaders
are currently a dime a dozen.

230
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,680
It's just one of the many things

231
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,960
that makes being alive right now
simply great.

232
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,920
No, what makes
Berdimuhamedov unique is that,

233
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,640
even among strongman dictators,

234
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,920
he is truly, deeply
and compellingly odd.

235
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,080
So tonight,
let's take a look at him.

236
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,560
And while this story is going
to get very weird, I promise you:

237
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,200
in 20 minutes, you're not
so much gonna be wondering

238
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,000
why we talked
about Turkmenistan,

239
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,960
as why we'd ever talk about
anything else ever again.

240
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,480
And let's start with the obvious
autocrat stuff here.

241
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,160
He's been running Turkmenistan
for 12 years,

242
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,280
and in his most recent election,
he won with 98% of the vote.

243
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,680
And like many autocrats, he's fond
of showcasing his physical prowess,

244
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,640
which you kind of already
knew from watching him

245
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,120
install a shower rod
on hashtag #armday.

246
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,640
And there's just no shortage of
videos online where you can see him

247
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,760
firing weapons and throwing knives
to impress his troops.

248
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,040
But that is just
the beginning.

249
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,600
Because Berdimuhamedov takes

250
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,840
those standard-issue
cult-of personality antics,

251
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,640
and does them
just a little bit stranger.

252
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,760
By shooting targets down
while riding a bike,

253
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,200
our great commander-in-chief

254
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,880
once again demonstrated
his physical readiness.

255
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,280
This became a moment
when our dear leader,

256
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,560
who has high skills in every trade,

257
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,880
demonstrated his level
of masterfulness.

258
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,680
Oh, yes, total masterfulness !

259
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,080
So watch out,
enemies of Turkmenistan,

260
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,360
because Berdimuhamedov
will not hesitate

261
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,560
to slowly ride a bike near you

262
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,960
and shoot a gun
in your general vicinity

263
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,360
before an editor makes it
look like he actually hit you !

264
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,640
But it is not just knife tossing
and gun-cycling.

265
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,120
Berdimuhamedov is also an artist,
and his canvas is the human ear.

266
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,160
He went viral last year with a rap
video recorded with his grandson

267
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,760
about the importance of sports
called "Sportly Türkmenistan."

268
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,600
Sport and the health is inspiration,

269
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,160
makes for the show
and show all the nations,

270
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,600
gives you a joy
and raise spirit high,

271
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,040
sports is the way
to your healthy life.

272
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,400
Turkmenistan, Turkmenistan !

273
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,760
Fire.

274
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,280
Everything
about that video is perfect.

275
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,320
From the fact that neither of them
are playing their instruments,

276
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,320
to the fact that they just rhymed
"Turkmenistan" with "Turkmenistan."

277
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,520
All in all, it is a fun,
catchy sports anthem

278
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,760
truly worthy of "Jock Jams
Volume 40: Maybe Sports Suck ?"

279
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,880
But his musical talents
don't just stop there.

280
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,680
He also D.J.s, plays the piano,

281
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,760
and is a guitarist
who goes to great lengths

282
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,960
to conceal
his blistering chops.

283
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,720
Holy shit.

284
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,200
He looks like he's playing a duet
with the smoke monster from "Lost."

285
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,840
That stage looks like
the back-entrance to a church

286
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,880
after a French AA meeting.

287
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,360
So, he's a strongman
who likes D.J.ing,

288
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,560
rapping with his grandson,
and playing the guitar.

289
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,920
But amazingly, we haven't even
gotten to the truly weird stuff yet !

290
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,440
'Cause Berdimuhamedov
also likes horses. Like, a lot.

291
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,560
Like, the incorrect amount.

292
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,560
Like, to the extent that it distracts

293
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,720
from everything he's done during
his nearly 13-year presidency.

294
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,440
Just think about how much Angela
Merkel would have to like turtles

295
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,760
for someone to go on TV and say,
"We don't have much time,"

296
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,440
"so let's put aside everything she's
ever done as chancellor of Germany"

297
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,480
"and let's focus
on the turtle thing."

298
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,200
That is how much
Berdimuhamedov likes horses.

299
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,640
And not just any horse, he's
specifically a fan of the Akhal-Teke.

300
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,720
Which isn't in itself unusual,

301
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,960
it's a beloved national symbol
in Turkmenistan.

302
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,200
But not only does he give Akhal-Tekes
as gifts to other world leaders,

303
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,440
he's written multiple
books on horses,

304
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,200
including "The Horse - A Symbol
of Faithfulness and Happiness,"

305
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,520
"The Flight
of The Celestial Race Horses,"

306
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,120
and
"Akhalteke - Our Pride And Glory."

307
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,440
Until recently, an official
English-language copy of that book

308
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,200
was actually available on Amazon,

309
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,840
but unfortunately,
there was only one copy,

310
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,000
and it appears
that someone bought it,

311
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,000
shipped it to New York,
and put it under my desk.

312
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,360
Because... would you like to hear
my favorite passage from this book ?

313
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,440
Because it's this, and I quote,

314
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,960
"Witnesses never wearied
of being astonished"

315
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,440
"by the steed-and-human intercourse
brought to full perfection."

316
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,480
Which I'm hoping is a mistranslation,
but probably isn't

317
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,760
because Berdimuhamedov
has involved himself

318
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,160
in all stages
of the horse lifecycle.

319
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,400
A few years ago,
he awarded himself the title

320
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,000
"The People's Horse Breeder."

321
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,520
He's also made it illegal

322
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,280
to change an Akhal-Teke horse's name
during its lifetime.

323
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,480
And a few years ago,
issued a presidential decree

324
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,640
instituting a tradition
of beauty contests for horses.

325
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,520
Which is definitely odd, but at the
same time, you do have to admit:

326
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,680
the Akhal-Teke is a beautiful horse.

327
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,520
I mean, that's a super fuckable horse
right there.

328
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,440
I'm not saying that
I would fuck that horse,

329
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,920
I'm just saying that if I was
a horse, I would fuck that horse.

330
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,200
To be clear: me, John Oliver the
human, would not fuck that horse.

331
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,960
But John Oliver the horse
would definitely fuck that horse.

332
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,840
That's not weird, I'd be a horse !

333
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,080
Horses fuck other horses
all the time,

334
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,000
that's how they make new horses.

335
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,000
I guess what I'm saying is,
if I was a horse and you said to me,

336
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,640
"Fuck, marry, kill:
Mustang, Akhal-Teke, Clydesdale."

337
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,360
No question in my horse mind:

338
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,880
fuck the Akhal-Teke,
marry the Mustang,

339
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,720
send the Clydesdale
to the glue factory.

340
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,920
But again, only if I was a horse !

341
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,680
And look, admittedly,
I've thought about this a lot,

342
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,280
but definitely not as much
as Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov has.

343
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,840
Amazingly, he reportedly owns
more than 600 Akhal-Tekes,

344
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,080
which is almost 10 percent
of the world's total.

345
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,640
He owns a plurality of them !
That is objectively too many horses.

346
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,120
Imagine owning 10%
of the world's total of anything.

347
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,560
And I say this as the owner of

348
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:45,200
100% of Amazon's inventory
of "Akhalteke - Our Pride And Glory."

349
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,200
Now, earlier this year,

350
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,000
someone actually gave Berdimuhamedov
yet another one, named "Rovach,"

351
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,680
and he was so excited that
he wrote a poem about his new horse,

352
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
and read it on state TV.
And this is real.

353
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,160
You are the worship
and memorabilia of ancestors,

354
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,840
you are the passage
of the past into tomorrow,

355
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,160
your neighing is the melody
of heavens,

356
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,920
Rovach, you are the anthem
of my heart !

357
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,120
Wait, just wait.

358
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,200
"Your neighing
is the melody of heavens ?"

359
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,800
Writing a fuck-sonnet
about a horse is weird;

360
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,480
it strongly suggests that he'd like
to have sex with that horse.

361
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,720
But writing a fuck-sonnet
about a horse

362
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,120
while sitting on a horse throne
among horse-accented cabinetry,

363
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,960
complimented by a horse statue,
horseshoe

364
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,040
and custom desk inlaid
with gold horses ?

365
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,680
That strongly suggests
that he actually already did.

366
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,520
The point is:
President Equus here likes horses.

367
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,360
But do horses like him ?

368
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,240
The answer, and this is a direct
quote, is "nay."

369
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,080
And don't just take that from me,
don't take that from me.

370
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,800
Look at Rovach's expression there.

371
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,480
That's not so much an expression

372
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,840
as a physical manifestation
of the phrase "I can't even."

373
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,160
And this isn't even the first time

374
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,840
a horse has seemed to have
an issue with Berdimuhamedov.

375
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,600
Just watch what happened when he
participated in a horse race in 2013.

376
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,960
And before I show you this,
I should say two things.

377
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,720
First, remember,
he runs a country

378
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,360
where activists are disappeared
in the prison system

379
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,560
and which has hit the bottom of
a number of human rights indexes.

380
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,520
And second: the horse you're about
to see was fine, here. It was fine.

381
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,160
So with those two things
in mind, watch this.

382
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,760
Again: the horse is alive and well.

383
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,280
I can prove it to you: here he is
doing donuts around a fire pit.

384
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,400
You have to be alive to do that.
Case closed.

385
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,920
Now, interestingly, when that race
aired on TV in Turkmenistan,

386
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,800
the footage cut off a split-second
before his fall.

387
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,600
So, Berdimuhamedov really didn't
want people to see that footage.

388
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,960
Specifically, this footage.

389
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,040
Exactly. That's the footage that
he really didn't want people to see.

390
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,600
In fact, he was so concerned
that people might see it,

391
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,160
journalists were apparently asked

392
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,320
to erase all pictures and footage
taken of the incident,

393
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,760
and at the airport,
officials conducted extra checks

394
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,480
for flash sticks and camera memory
disks for any traces of the video.

395
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,560
And look: I'm not gonna show you
that same video again.

396
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,080
I mean, why would I ?
When I can instead show you

397
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,520
a closer angle
of the exact same incident.

398
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,440
Again: the horse is fine.
And, this is true, a hero.

399
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
So, to summarize here:

400
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,200
Turkmenistan's authoritarian
president is a strongman-slash-D.J.

401
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,000
with a creepy, unreciprocated
affection for horses.

402
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,080
And that is where
this story ends.

403
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,920
Or, at least it was going to,

404
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,440
until we learned about
one last bizarre obsession of his.

405
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,840
And in the words of Turkmen
airport officials

406
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,080
inspecting
the luggage of foreign journalists:

407
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,000
we are going to have to unpack it.

408
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,920
The president has a childlike
obsession

409
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,200
with collecting
Guinness World Records.

410
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,000
Ashgabat holds the record for

411
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,320
"Highest density of buildings
with white marble cladding."

412
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,440
This tower won a world record for

413
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,160
"Largest
architectural image of a star."

414
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,800
Again, a Guinness record
for the hotly contested title of

415
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,800
"World's largest indoor
Ferris wheel."

416
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,920
Okay, all right. First of all:

417
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,440
the only thing worse than a Ferris
wheel is an indoor Ferris wheel.

418
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,520
And second, the "Highest density of
buildings with white marble cladding"

419
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,040
is just a pointless record.

420
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,880
I get he clearly has
an obsession with marble,

421
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,280
the man even built a statue
of himself on a golden horse

422
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,160
atop a massive white marble cliff,
but at some point,

423
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,400
a record is so bizarrely specific
it ceases to be impressive,

424
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,040
like "Largest bowl of goulash
eaten while watching 'Frasier,'"

425
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,240
or "World's tallest Ansel Elgort."

426
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,960
Also incidentally,
the "World's smallest Ansel Elgort."

427
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,360
But the point is, during his
tenure as president,

428
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,800
Turkmenistan has aggressively set
a number of Guinness records,

429
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,760
including the "World's highest number
of fountain pools in a public space,"

430
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,520
the "World's longest
single line bicycle parade,"

431
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,160
the "World's largest horse
head statue", of course,

432
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,560
and the "World's largest cycling
awareness lesson."

433
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,880
We actually found footage of him
setting that record,

434
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,680
and he seemed
pretty psyched about his achievement.

435
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,560
I would like to express
my special appreciation

436
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,120
to a representative of
the Guinness Record Book

437
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,320
for a certificate for the largest
cycling awareness lesson.

438
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,840
This respected award
is another one

439
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,080
into the collection
of our country's Guinness records.

440
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,560
Okay, okay. So...

441
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,360
First of all, a cycling awareness
lesson seems entirely unnecessary.

442
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,000
Cycling is what you do
when you want to lose a gunfight

443
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,480
as slowly and as inaccurately
as possible.

444
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,760
Who isn't aware of that
by this point ?

445
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,240
But here is where the story

446
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,800
is actually gonna shift away from
Turkmenistan for a minute,

447
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,720
although I promise we will be back.

448
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
Because at this point,
we started wondering:

449
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,880
what is an official from
Guinness World Records doing

450
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,480
in one of the most repressive
countries on earth,

451
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,880
certifying records for an autocrat ?

452
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,000
'Cause this is supposed to be
the fun-loving company

453
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,240
that certifies quirky records
like, and these are real,

454
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,920
"Most apples held in the mouth
and cut by chainsaw in one minute"

455
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,120
or "Oldest male stripper."
It's supposed to be fun.

456
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,120
But when we started looking into it,

457
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,720
we discovered that,
in the last few years,

458
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,320
a big chunk of Guinness
World Records' income

459
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,000
now comes from helping companies
and other clients

460
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,000
invent and break
new records to get publicity,

461
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,920
things like working
with General Mills

462
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,160
to set the record
for "World's longest line of tacos."

463
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,680
Basically, they can help design
an event

464
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,480
and even send an official
adjudicator,

465
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,680
like the one you just saw,
to award the record on the spot.

466
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,400
But that doesn't come cheap.

467
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,360
For a full-service event,
they reportedly charge

468
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,600
anywhere from 12,000
to over half a million dollars.

469
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,280
And you might think,
"Okay. But who gives a shit ?"

470
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,560
"I'm not a nine-year-old waiting
to testify in family court."

471
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,720
"Why do I care about
the Guinness Book of World Records ?"

472
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,960
But the thing is,
it's not just companies,

473
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,760
they also work
with authoritarian governments.

474
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,600
And Berdimuhamedov
isn't the only one.

475
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,320
Guinness World Records has also sent
adjudicators to Saudi Arabia

476
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,920
to certify records like their
"World's largest flagpole,"

477
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,600
and has repeatedly worked
with the Dubai police force,

478
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,320
helping them break 11 records,
among them,

479
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,280
"Most consecutive formations formed
by unmanned aerial vehicles."

480
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,920
And if you're wondering
what that even means,

481
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,440
here is what it looked like.

482
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,160
Okay, all right,
all right, all right.

483
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,760
First: I would argue he could be
slightly more impressed

484
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,560
by that drone constellation
of his own face.

485
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,840
Although I will say this:
that might actually be

486
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,520
the single most ethically defensible
use of drones in the Middle East.

487
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,280
The whole point
we're making here is:

488
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,280
authoritarians
love getting Guinness World Records.

489
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,520
And you can see why,
they reinforce a cult of personality

490
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,600
and confer a sense of legitimacy
on a global stage.

491
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,280
Which brings us back
to Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov.

492
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,520
Because
he absolutely loves them.

493
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,840
So if you wanted to hurt him,
they'd actually be his weak point.

494
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,920
The only question is:
if you wanted to embarrass

495
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,960
this particular
human rights-abusing horse-fucker,

496
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,120
what record would hurt him the most ?

497
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,200
I mean, it'd have to involve
some of his favorite things,

498
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,480
like horses, and white marble.

499
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,760
And also include
a humiliating moment

500
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,360
that he didn't want people
to know about.

501
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,960
So, hypothetically, if you could
make the world's largest marble cake,

502
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,000
featuring the image
of him falling off a horse,

503
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,560
that would check
all of the boxes, there, right ?

504
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,840
I mean, of course, it wouldn't
be easy, would it ?

505
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,240
The current record
for "Largest marble cake"

506
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,600
is around 160-square-feet,

507
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,040
set by Betty Crocker
in where else but Saudi Arabia ?

508
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,040
Also, you'd ideally want
an official adjudicator

509
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,200
to come and certify
the cake immediately.

510
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,440
And unfortunately, here is where
I do have some bad news.

511
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,800
Because we actually planned
to bake a 600-square-foot cake

512
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,400
that would make Betty Crocker's
look like a fucking mouse Twinkie,

513
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,520
but when we reached out
to Guinness World Records,

514
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,120
and we asked them to send someone,
they declined, saying, and I quote,

515
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,720
"unfortunately, because our brand
is aligned with kids and families,"

516
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,400
"this record attempt is not one"

517
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,000
"that we will be able to provide
an adjudicator for."

518
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,840
Which is, yeah, it's a real shame.

519
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,800
I guess we just don't run
a brutal enough dictatorship

520
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,080
to meet Guinness World Records'
high ethical standards.

521
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,520
Although they did say that if we
fully documented making the cake,

522
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,160
they might certify us after the fact.

523
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,320
Unfortunately, they wanted us
to sign an agreement

524
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,440
that could've prevented us
from criticizing them in this story,

525
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,560
which is clearly ridiculous.

526
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,080
But then it hit us:

527
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,520
we don't need Guinness World Records
to make a world-record-sized cake.

528
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,600
And if we did, not only would we be
annoying an authoritarian leader,

529
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,200
we'd also now be annoying these guys.

530
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,800
So, so did we bake it ?

531
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,120
I mean, I guess I really only have
two questions for you at this point.

532
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,720
One: are you
ready to make history ?

533
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,880
And two: who wants
some fucking cake ?

534
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:47,360
Because
behold this monstrous folly !

535
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,200
I told you things were gonna
get weird tonight, didn't I ?

536
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,560
Admit it: when I said earlier, our
main story concerns Turkmenistan,

537
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,160
you did not expect
the show to end 20 minutes later

538
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,960
with me standing next
to the world's largest marble cake

539
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,080
depicting a guy falling off a horse.
Yet here we are !

540
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,840
I have some good news:

541
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,320
everyone in this audience is gonna
get some cake to take home tonight

542
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,640
and the rest of this magnificent
frosted beast

543
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,240
will be donated
to City Harvest.

544
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,480
We did it, guys !
We did it !

545
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,360
We did it !

546
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,920
Clap for me, cyclists !
Clap for me now !

547
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,040
That's our show,
thank you so much for watching,

548
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,480
see you next week,
good night !

549
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,720
We did it !

550
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,960
We did it !
