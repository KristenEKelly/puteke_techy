1
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,004
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

2
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:36,924
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

3
00:00:37,084 --> 00:00:39,444
Unfortunately, we must begin
with the tragic events

4
00:00:39,604 --> 00:00:42,484
in Christchurch, where 50 people
were killed and many injured

5
00:00:42,644 --> 00:00:45,604
when a white supremacist
terrorist attacked two mosques.

6
00:00:45,764 --> 00:00:49,684
And look, this wasn't just
a disgusting act from a fucking asshole.

7
00:00:49,844 --> 00:00:53,244
It was an affront to the basic values
of the people of New Zealand,

8
00:00:53,404 --> 00:00:55,404
as their prime minister pointed out.

9
00:00:55,564 --> 00:00:59,884
We were not chosen for this act
of violence because we condone racism,

10
00:01:00,044 --> 00:01:02,324
because we're an enclave
for extremism.

11
00:01:02,484 --> 00:01:08,004
We were chosen for the very fact
that we are none of these things.

12
00:01:08,164 --> 00:01:12,124
She's absolutely right, because
New Zealand is an incredible place.

13
00:01:12,284 --> 00:01:15,564
And I know that we make fun
of it on this show all the time.

14
00:01:15,724 --> 00:01:19,724
There is honestly nothing I like more
than making fun of New Zealand,

15
00:01:19,884 --> 00:01:22,524
but part of that may be because
controversies over there

16
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:24,684
are handled
with charm and good cheer.

17
00:01:24,844 --> 00:01:26,524
How can you not love a country

18
00:01:26,684 --> 00:01:30,684
that has a contest to design a new flag
for itself and someone submits this:

19
00:01:30,844 --> 00:01:34,844
a kiwi bird shooting lasers
out of its eyes?

20
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:38,724
My point is, New Zealand is amazing,
and it is showing its strength

21
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:40,644
in how it's responded to this tragedy.

22
00:01:40,804 --> 00:01:44,444
The same, sadly, cannot be said
for Australia's Fraser Anning,

23
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:49,044
a hard-line racist politician
and melted candle of Ed Harris.

24
00:01:49,204 --> 00:01:51,604
We've actually talked about him
before on this show,

25
00:01:51,764 --> 00:01:54,524
after he proposed a final
solution to Muslim immigration.

26
00:01:54,684 --> 00:01:58,804
And his response to the Christchurch
shooting was very much on brand.

27
00:01:58,964 --> 00:02:01,284
This was the statement
from an Australian senator:

28
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:03,844
"The real cause of bloodshed
on New Zealand streets

29
00:02:04,004 --> 00:02:06,724
"is the immigration program
which allowed Muslim fanatics

30
00:02:06,884 --> 00:02:09,004
to migrate to New Zealand
in the first place."

31
00:02:09,164 --> 00:02:12,004
It goes on to say, "Muslims may
have been the victims today.

32
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:14,044
Usually they are the perpetrators."

33
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:18,964
Holy shit. That might be
the worst possible response

34
00:02:19,124 --> 00:02:21,284
to what happened,
because even if you responded

35
00:02:21,444 --> 00:02:23,924
by saying, "The Christchurch
attack makes me wonder,

36
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:26,724
"was 'DuckTales' supposed to be
in Scotland or America?

37
00:02:26,884 --> 00:02:29,964
I'm guessing America, but when
did Scrooge McDuck move?"

38
00:02:30,124 --> 00:02:32,044
I mean, you're way off topic there,

39
00:02:32,204 --> 00:02:36,643
but you're also not calling Muslims
terrorists, so still a better response.

40
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:40,003
Thankfully, there was immediate outcry
following Anning's comments,

41
00:02:40,163 --> 00:02:42,203
and one young Australian
went a bit further.

42
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:43,883
These sort of things happen.

43
00:02:44,043 --> 00:02:48,483
When people are getting
attacked in their own--

44
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,403
<i>You weren't seeing things there.</i>

45
00:02:51,563 --> 00:02:54,203
<i>The teenager smacked an egg</i>
<i>on the senator's head.</i>

46
00:02:54,363 --> 00:02:57,443
<i>You saw the senator fight back.</i>
<i>The boy was led away by police.</i>

47
00:02:57,603 --> 00:03:00,883
<i>He's reportedly been released.</i>
<i>A fundraising page has been set up</i>

48
00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:04,603
<i>to collect donations to cover</i>
<i>the teenager's legal fees</i>

49
00:03:04,763 --> 00:03:06,843
<i>and to "buy more eggs."</i>

50
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:09,483
"More eggs."
That is fantastic.

51
00:03:09,643 --> 00:03:13,683
And look, you might argue that an act
like that has no place in politics,

52
00:03:13,843 --> 00:03:17,483
and I'm sure Fraser Anning is furious.
He did punch that boy in the face.

53
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:20,403
But I've prepared a statement
in response on that.

54
00:03:20,563 --> 00:03:22,923
The real cause of Anning
getting hit with an egg

55
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:26,483
is Anning saying things
that prompt people to throw eggs at him.

56
00:03:26,643 --> 00:03:31,483
He may be the victim today,
but usually he's a huge fucking asshole.

57
00:03:31,643 --> 00:03:35,003
But for now--for now,
let's move on to Brexit,

58
00:03:35,163 --> 00:03:37,083
which is, of course,
a mash-up of the words

59
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:40,683
"Britain," "exit,"
and "gone to shit."

60
00:03:40,843 --> 00:03:44,963
Britain's deadline to leave the EU
is March 29th, just 12 days away now.

61
00:03:45,123 --> 00:03:48,643
The country's had two years to prepare
for this, so how's it going?

62
00:03:48,803 --> 00:03:52,083
Well, this week was, to put it mildly,
a little bumpy.

63
00:03:52,243 --> 00:03:53,563
To the casual observer,

64
00:03:53,723 --> 00:03:56,123
it may seem Westminster
and our political leaders

65
00:03:56,283 --> 00:03:58,283
are in a bit of a mess over Brexit.

66
00:03:58,443 --> 00:04:00,163
Experts tend to disagree.

67
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,443
They say it's very much worse
than that.

68
00:04:02,603 --> 00:04:06,643
Wow. Do you know how bad
things have to be in Britain

69
00:04:06,803 --> 00:04:10,083
for something to be very much
worse than a bit of a mess?

70
00:04:10,243 --> 00:04:12,723
Remember, this is a people
who refer to three decades

71
00:04:12,883 --> 00:04:15,523
of sustained sectarian violence
as "The Troubles,"

72
00:04:15,683 --> 00:04:19,443
which sounds like an adorable euphemism
for an infant with diarrhea.

73
00:04:19,603 --> 00:04:23,403
"Oh, dear, it seems Alistair
has come down with the troubles again."

74
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,483
But things are indeed a real mess.

75
00:04:25,643 --> 00:04:28,483
You remember in January,
Theresa May presented to Parliament

76
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,643
an agreement she made with the EU,
not for a final Brexit deal,

77
00:04:31,803 --> 00:04:35,483
but just for a transition period, during
which time that deal would be made.

78
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:38,683
That plan was voted down
in Parliament by historic margin.

79
00:04:38,843 --> 00:04:42,883
This week, she re-presented essentially
the same deal with minor tweaks,

80
00:04:43,043 --> 00:04:47,603
and even supporters of the deal
defended it in less than glowing terms.

81
00:04:47,763 --> 00:04:50,283
It's a choice I do not want
to have to make

82
00:04:50,443 --> 00:04:55,683
between--excuse my language,
Mr. Speaker-- a turd of a deal,

83
00:04:55,843 --> 00:05:00,003
which has now been taken away
and polished and is now a polished turd.

84
00:05:00,163 --> 00:05:03,483
But it might be the best turd
that we've got before us.

85
00:05:03,643 --> 00:05:08,843
Oh, my God. I only wish
that right before the Brexit vote,

86
00:05:09,003 --> 00:05:11,523
a wormhole had opened up in time,

87
00:05:11,683 --> 00:05:13,603
so people could see
that two years later,

88
00:05:13,763 --> 00:05:16,243
supporters of the plan to leave
will be saying,

89
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:20,403
"All of our options are turds.
Come join me in my turd menagerie.

90
00:05:20,563 --> 00:05:22,843
"Select a turd
that suits your fancy,

91
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:25,683
"so we may ride that turd
into a bold new era,

92
00:05:25,843 --> 00:05:28,123
an era of turds."

93
00:05:28,283 --> 00:05:30,123
As if things
weren't already dumb enough,

94
00:05:30,283 --> 00:05:33,603
due to the UK's stupid ban on using
parliamentary footage for comedy,

95
00:05:33,763 --> 00:05:36,163
we once more cannot show
that clip in Britain,

96
00:05:36,323 --> 00:05:40,363
so in place of it, they'll be watching,
with no explanation whatsoever,

97
00:05:40,523 --> 00:05:43,203
this clip from a 1980s dating video.

98
00:05:43,363 --> 00:05:46,043
I'm Mike, and if you're sitting there
watching this tape,

99
00:05:46,203 --> 00:05:48,603
smoking your cigarette,
hit the fast-forward button,

100
00:05:48,763 --> 00:05:51,483
'cause I don't smoke
and I don't like people who do smoke.

101
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:54,963
Wow.
Hard swipe left from Mike there.

102
00:05:55,123 --> 00:05:57,723
That's the point. Britain will get
Mike the Non-Smoker

103
00:05:57,883 --> 00:05:59,523
followed by a long joke about turds,

104
00:05:59,683 --> 00:06:01,683
and they'll have brought that
on themselves.

105
00:06:01,843 --> 00:06:05,443
Unsurprisingly, May's plan was
voted down by Parliament on Tuesday,

106
00:06:05,603 --> 00:06:07,963
taking Britain closer
to the worst-case scenario,

107
00:06:08,123 --> 00:06:11,643
the so-called "no-deal Brexit."
And the good news is, the next day,

108
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:14,643
they voted in favor of a motion
saying that, no matter what,

109
00:06:14,803 --> 00:06:17,003
Britain won't leave the EU
without a deal.

110
00:06:17,163 --> 00:06:19,723
The bad news is,
that motion is non-binding.

111
00:06:19,883 --> 00:06:24,363
So it carries all the legal obligation
of a wish painted onto a lantern

112
00:06:24,523 --> 00:06:28,163
and released into the deep purple
of the star-dappled summertime sky.

113
00:06:28,323 --> 00:06:30,843
Or, as one European official put it...

114
00:06:31,003 --> 00:06:34,763
Just by saying we don't want a no-deal
Brexit doesn't mean it doesn't happen.

115
00:06:34,923 --> 00:06:39,043
Now, there isn't an alternative,
or if there isn't an idea

116
00:06:39,203 --> 00:06:42,202
of what the alternative
could be by the 29th of March,

117
00:06:42,362 --> 00:06:45,362
there might be a no-deal Brexit,
even if nobody wants it.

118
00:06:45,522 --> 00:06:49,522
You know, European history
is rife of moments

119
00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:52,482
where things happened
that nobody wanted.

120
00:06:52,642 --> 00:06:54,002
Is it, though?

121
00:06:54,162 --> 00:06:57,042
I'm not saying European history
isn't rife with bad moments,

122
00:06:57,202 --> 00:07:00,642
but almost always, those things happened
because people wanted them to,

123
00:07:00,802 --> 00:07:04,162
even people who might later say
they didn't want the things to happen.

124
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:06,722
Many of them did.
Not everyone's grandpa was

125
00:07:06,882 --> 00:07:10,002
one of the good ones trying to prevent
the things from happening.

126
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:13,762
Look at the numbers. They couldn't all
have been one of the few good ones.

127
00:07:13,922 --> 00:07:16,962
Somebody's grandpa must have
wanted the things to happen,

128
00:07:17,122 --> 00:07:20,722
and here is the thing, it was yours.

129
00:07:20,882 --> 00:07:24,562
So Parliament decided that
they didn't want "no deal,"

130
00:07:24,722 --> 00:07:26,762
but they also didn't want
Theresa May's deal.

131
00:07:26,922 --> 00:07:29,402
So in another
non-binding wish lantern,

132
00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:34,082
they then resolved that May should ask
the EU for an extension until June 30th.

133
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:36,362
What would they do
with that extra time?

134
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:39,322
That's unclear, and also,
the EU would have to agree to it,

135
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:41,882
all of which is so deeply
confusing and frustrating,

136
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:45,162
even journalists were snapping
at cabinet ministers.

137
00:07:45,322 --> 00:07:49,722
Secretary of State, you know better
than I do that Parliament is for once

138
00:07:49,882 --> 00:07:51,962
deeply representative
of the country.

139
00:07:52,122 --> 00:07:53,522
It's completely asunder.

140
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,682
Nobody in the country
knows what's going on.

141
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,522
Nobody in there
knows what's going on.

142
00:07:57,682 --> 00:08:00,722
And you know nothing,
even inside the cabinet.

143
00:08:00,882 --> 00:08:03,202
The cabinet is at sea.
The country's at sea.

144
00:08:03,362 --> 00:08:06,042
- We are a laughingstock.
- Is that a question?

145
00:08:06,202 --> 00:08:09,762
No, no.
You know what? It's not.

146
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:14,842
It's not actually a question,
so let me take another stab at one.

147
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:18,162
You really fucked up, right?
See? There's a question.

148
00:08:18,322 --> 00:08:20,162
There's a question for you!

149
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:23,042
The truth is, a bad Brexit outcome

150
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,602
was guaranteed the minute
the vote went final.

151
00:08:25,762 --> 00:08:29,042
There are not, nor will there ever be
good Brexit options.

152
00:08:29,202 --> 00:08:32,642
So members of Parliament need to accept
their options now are limited,

153
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:36,882
as this MP, who voted for May's deal,
seems to have done.

154
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:38,922
We were just discussing
in my office

155
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:41,562
how we would describe
the current situation,

156
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:43,802
and using good old
Cumbrian terminology,

157
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:46,442
we were really torn between
whether it's a pig's ear,

158
00:08:46,602 --> 00:08:48,562
a dog's dinner, or a cat's arse.

159
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:50,642
Okay, okay. Okay.

160
00:08:50,802 --> 00:08:54,682
First, fuck the dog's dinner,
marry the cat's arse,

161
00:08:54,842 --> 00:08:56,282
and kill the pig's ear.

162
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:59,562
It's easy. Unless, that is,
you're David Cameron,

163
00:08:59,722 --> 00:09:03,082
in which case, you marry the pig's ear,
'cause you've fucked his face.

164
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,762
You make an honest hog
out of that swine corpse,

165
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:09,282
'cause you're a good guy who's in no way
responsible for this mess.

166
00:09:09,442 --> 00:09:11,482
But I would actually argue that
that MP

167
00:09:11,642 --> 00:09:15,322
has inadvertently hit upon the perfect
metaphor for Britain's choices.

168
00:09:15,482 --> 00:09:18,802
The pig's ear is the decision to leave,
because it's absurd.

169
00:09:18,962 --> 00:09:21,802
The dog's dinner is the exit plan,
because it's distasteful,

170
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,042
but we have to swallow it,
it's all we've got.

171
00:09:24,202 --> 00:09:26,882
And the cat's arse is the consequence
of what we've done,

172
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:31,202
because it's shitty, but we'll have to
have it shoved in our faces repeatedly

173
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,602
for a long fucking time to come.

174
00:09:33,762 --> 00:09:35,162
And now this.

175
00:09:35,322 --> 00:09:38,522
<i>And now, in honor</i>
<i>of St. Patrick's Day,</i>

176
00:09:38,682 --> 00:09:41,922
<i>Sean Hannity celebrates</i>
<i>his heritage.</i>

177
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,882
Okay.
I'm hopefully optimistic.

178
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:48,322
- I'm Irish. Don't worry, it's normal.
- Oh, you are.

179
00:09:48,482 --> 00:09:50,882
I like fear as a motivator.
And I'm Irish.

180
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:53,162
I'm thinking the worst-case scenario.

181
00:09:53,322 --> 00:09:54,642
Maybe it's because I'm Irish,

182
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:57,602
maybe 'cause I'm always
expecting the worst.

183
00:09:57,762 --> 00:10:00,082
My grandparents came
to this country from Ireland.

184
00:10:00,242 --> 00:10:02,842
All four of my grandparents
came from Ireland.

185
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,722
What is an Irish seven course meal?

186
00:10:04,882 --> 00:10:06,882
- What?
- A six-pack and a potato.

187
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:08,522
What's an Irish
seven course meal?

188
00:10:08,682 --> 00:10:10,802
- You tell me, bro.
- A six-pack and a potato.

189
00:10:10,962 --> 00:10:12,802
Seven course meal,
six-pack and a potato.

190
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:15,042
Six-pack. Six-pack.
Six-pack and a potato.

191
00:10:15,202 --> 00:10:17,482
A six-pack and a potato.
I'd laugh.

192
00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:19,442
- That's funny.
- You never heard that?

193
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:21,522
Excuse me.
No, I never heard it.

194
00:10:21,682 --> 00:10:23,682
You know what an Irish
seven course meal is?

195
00:10:23,842 --> 00:10:26,962
- A six-pack and a potato.
- Is that right?

196
00:10:27,122 --> 00:10:29,642
Seven course meal is
a six-pack and a potato.

197
00:10:29,802 --> 00:10:32,202
<i>A six-pack and a potato, okay?</i>

198
00:10:32,362 --> 00:10:35,162
<i>A six-pack and a potato.</i>

199
00:10:35,322 --> 00:10:36,722
That's funny.

200
00:10:39,202 --> 00:10:44,081
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns public shaming,

201
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:47,401
or as we call it in England,
parenting.

202
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:51,321
Thanks to the internet, it's never been
easier to pile onto a public shaming.

203
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:54,121
In fact, it's now one of
America's favorite pastimes.

204
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:56,521
A Wisconsin family's
photo shoot's gone viral,

205
00:10:56,681 --> 00:10:58,241
and it's sparking outrage online.

206
00:10:58,401 --> 00:11:01,081
A viral video leads to outrage
on Long Island.

207
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:03,801
Now the outrage over
another viral video.

208
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:06,121
The outrage machine
never seems to rest.

209
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:08,281
As actress Sarah Michelle Gellar
found out,

210
00:11:08,441 --> 00:11:11,961
<i>some people online are just looking</i>
<i>for an excuse to be angry.</i>

211
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:14,721
Wait, what did
Sarah Michelle Gellar do?

212
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:17,241
I'm already so angry about it!

213
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:20,241
Actually, don't tell me.
I just realized I don't care.

214
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:23,361
The point is, this is a golden age
of internet shaming,

215
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:25,201
and you've probably
participated in it

216
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:28,401
if you've been mad at a potential
Oscar host with shitty tweets,

217
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:31,361
a company who made a blackface shirt,
a beloved Irish actor

218
00:11:31,521 --> 00:11:33,321
who wanted to commit
a racist murder,

219
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:35,681
and aquarium that called
an otter "thicc,"

220
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:38,361
a gender reveal party
that started a wildfire,

221
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:40,281
whoever attacked Jussie Smollett,

222
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:44,201
whoever didn't believe Jussie Smollett,
and finally, Jussie Smollett.

223
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:46,721
We're basically goldfish,
except instead of

224
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:49,761
discovering a new castle in our bowl
every nine seconds

225
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:52,801
we find something new
to be outraged about online.

226
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:55,921
You may be expecting me to say
that all public shaming is bad,

227
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:57,881
but I don't actually think that.

228
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,921
When it's well-directed,
a lot of good can come out of it.

229
00:12:01,081 --> 00:12:02,961
If someone's caught
doing something racist

230
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:06,281
or someone powerful behaves badly,
it can increase accountability.

231
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:09,961
This week, it emerged that Tucker
Carlson, the answer to the question,

232
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:12,681
"What if the sound 'thud'
grew a face?"

233
00:12:12,841 --> 00:12:16,641
had said some awful things
on a radio show a few years prior.

234
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:21,281
And to hear Tucks tell it, he was
unfairly caught up in public shaming.

235
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:25,681
The great American outrage machine
is a remarkable thing.

236
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:29,481
One day you're having dinner with your
family, imagining everything's fine.

237
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:33,121
The next, your phone is exploding
with calls from reporters.

238
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:35,881
First, no one having dinner
with Tucker Carlson

239
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:39,081
has ever imagined
everything was fine.

240
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:40,921
Most people's answer to the question

241
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:45,801
"If you could have dinner with anyone,
living or dead" is Tucker Carlson, dead.

242
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:49,641
And if you look into why Tucker
was caught in that "outrage machine,"

243
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:53,601
it's because he publicly called Iraqis
"semiliterate primitive monkeys,"

244
00:12:53,761 --> 00:12:56,241
compared women to dogs,
and basically said that

245
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,401
Warren Jeffs,
who is serving a life sentence

246
00:12:58,561 --> 00:13:01,881
for the sexual assault of his underage
brides, wasn't that bad.

247
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:05,841
Tucker refused to apologize and all week
long, there've been trending hashtags

248
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:08,841
like "boycott Tucker Carlson,"
and "fire Tucker Carlson,"

249
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:11,001
and "Tucker Carlson fucks
his Roomba."

250
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:13,321
That one wasn't technically trending,

251
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:16,961
but I have this weird feeling
that it will be in 20 minutes or so.

252
00:13:17,121 --> 00:13:21,361
And look, I would argue
that Tucker is actually

253
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:24,281
a good example of an internet
pile-on being merited.

254
00:13:24,441 --> 00:13:26,881
He's a public figure,
he made his comments publicly,

255
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,441
they are appalling,
and he's standing by them.

256
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,801
But clearly,
it's not always that simple,

257
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:34,481
because when misdirected,
internet pile-ons

258
00:13:34,641 --> 00:13:36,401
can completely destroy
people's lives.

259
00:13:36,561 --> 00:13:39,681
So tonight, let's try and talk about
the power of public shaming,

260
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:43,361
because often it is not a famous figure
who's on the receiving end of it.

261
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:47,521
On a seemingly daily basis, ordinary
people who did not ask for attention

262
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:51,201
can get sucked into the spotlight,
like this woman did a few years ago.

263
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:55,281
<i>They're calling her the Aunt From Hell</i>
<i>and the Auntie Christ.</i>

264
00:13:55,441 --> 00:13:57,961
An aunt files suit
against her 12-year-old nephew.

265
00:13:58,121 --> 00:14:01,161
She claims she broke her wrist
when he jumped into her arms.

266
00:14:01,321 --> 00:14:05,361
She sued her young nephew
for $127,000.

267
00:14:05,521 --> 00:14:10,041
That's right, $127,000 over a hug.

268
00:14:10,201 --> 00:14:12,801
Her defense was that
when she goes to a cocktail party,

269
00:14:12,961 --> 00:14:14,281
she actually said this,

270
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:17,761
she can't hold the plate
when the hors d'oeuvres are passed.

271
00:14:17,921 --> 00:14:19,521
- Oh.
- Because of her wrist.

272
00:14:19,681 --> 00:14:23,641
That sounds terrible, although I'll say
this. I know this isn't the point,

273
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:26,881
but everyone finds it difficult
to hold an hors d'oeuvres plate.

274
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,441
You have a plate in one hand
and wine in the other.

275
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:33,841
Do you grab food off the plate with your
teeth, like some kind of trained horse?

276
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:37,361
Do you hold the wine in your armpit
and grab food with your other hand

277
00:14:37,521 --> 00:14:40,041
then spend the rest of the night
drinking armpit wine?

278
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:41,601
It's an unsolvable puzzle.

279
00:14:41,761 --> 00:14:45,241
But look, it is pretty shitty
to force a 12-year-old boy

280
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:47,800
to pay six figures for hugging you
enthusiastically.

281
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,880
Which is, of course,
why she didn't actually do that.

282
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,240
The real story is
much more complicated.

283
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,080
Very basically, her health insurance
didn't cover her massive medical bills.

284
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,600
So to cover her costs,

285
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,720
she had to go through her relative's
homeowner's insurance.

286
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,520
To do that, she had to name
a person in a lawsuit,

287
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,720
even though the kid and his family
were completely fine with it,

288
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,600
and they would not be
required to pay.

289
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,360
She actually went on
"The Today Show"

290
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,320
<i>to explain all of this</i>
<i>after the story blew up.</i>

291
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,720
Unfortunately, it didn't seem
to undo the damage.

292
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,080
Maybe because even while
she was discussing the actual facts,

293
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,200
"The Today Show's" graphics read,
"Worst aunt ever speaks out."

294
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,280
Which doesn't really help, does it?

295
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,560
Meanwhile, she was being
relentlessly attacked on the internet,

296
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,040
meaning anyone Googling her
in the future would likely be inundated

297
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,400
by the inaccurate version of that story,
which, as she'll tell you,

298
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,080
became a real problem when
she was looking for work.

299
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,600
It was very difficult
to find another job.

300
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,080
People reached out
and then canceled interviews

301
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,920
or then said, "Oh, we've
changed our direction."

302
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,440
I've taken--had to take certain measures

303
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,600
in order to reestablish myself.

304
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,280
And I have a refreshed identity.

305
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,400
That's a pretty drastic
measure to have to take.

306
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,720
So to help her move past this,
if you talk about the show tonight,

307
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,960
remember to tag it with the hashtag
"just a normal aunt."

308
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,840
Hashtag "aunt from not hell,"

309
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,760
hashtag "Tucker Carlson
fucks his Roomba."

310
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,840
And look, there was every
reason for her to believe

311
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,920
that refreshing her identity
was necessary,

312
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,320
because fully two months after she went
on TV to correct the record,

313
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,960
Fox News was having this discussion.

314
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,520
Hashtag "worst aunt ever."

315
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,680
But I will tell you that she did then
come on to one of the media outlets

316
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,640
and say that she needed--
she was injured, obviously,

317
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,240
and wanted to sue
her homeowner's association,

318
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,840
but had to--or homeowner's
insurance--and had to name him

319
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,040
as the party and felt bad about it.

320
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,640
By the way, she fell because he was
so excited to see her.

321
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,360
- He jumped up in her arms.
- Right.

322
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,200
"Auntie Jen, I love you!
I love you!"

323
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,440
What are you doing there?

324
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,240
This is the worst aunt ever.
But in all seriousness,

325
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,600
she did the only thing she could have
done and feels bad about it.

326
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,360
But the important thing here is,
she's the worst aunt ever and...

327
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,840
Now, I am not saying those television
personalities are all terrible people.

328
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,720
They just want to fill time more than
they want to say things that are true.

329
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,680
But at some point
it's incumbent on everyone

330
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,040
to consider both context
and consequences

331
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,200
if you're going to pile on
in a shaming.

332
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,760
And I'm not saying
that anything here is easy.

333
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,560
For instance, did I just publicly shame
that lawyer in the last clip?

334
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,000
Yeah, I probably did. And honestly,
I'm absolutely fine with that.

335
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,480
I'm fine with calling him a human popped
collar whose every facial expression

336
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,600
says, "I only wish 'Green Book'
had won more Oscars."

337
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,600
And look-- look, let's be honest.

338
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,960
We make fun of people constantly
on this show. It's a comedy show.

339
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,800
Although, for what it is worth,
we do think,

340
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,440
probably more carefully
than you might imagine,

341
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,520
about who we're making fun of,
why we're doing it, and how.

342
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,600
We ask ourselves questions like,
"Should we use their name?

343
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,720
How much power do they have?"
and "Do they have a soul patch?"

344
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,400
That last one can be
a real deal breaker.

345
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,240
And I'm not saying
that we're perfect at all.

346
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,600
You might disagree with choices
that we've made,

347
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,680
but we've honestly thought about it.

348
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,720
And sometimes the decision is difficult.

349
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,200
Look at another major scandal
that broke this week

350
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,440
concerning fraud in college admissions.

351
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,920
<i>Actresses Felicity Huffman</i>
<i>and Lori Loughlin</i>

352
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,520
<i>among 33 wealthy parents accused of</i>
<i>bribing coaches and administrators</i>

353
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,080
<i>to get their kids</i>
<i>into elite universities.</i>

354
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,560
<i>Loughlin and her husband</i>
<i>Mossimo Giannulli</i>

355
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,840
<i>allegedly put up $1/2 million</i>

356
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,240
<i>in exchange for getting</i>
<i>their two daughters</i>

357
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
<i>recruited to the USC crew team,</i>

358
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,040
<i>even though they did not</i>
<i>participate in crew.</i>

359
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,240
Okay, that is such a weird story.

360
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,719
I don't think anyone guessed that
the next celebrity scandal would be

361
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:57,399
Aunt Becky from "Full House"
allegedly spends $1/2 million

362
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:01,919
so a guy will pretend her daughters
are good at boats.

363
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:05,559
And incidentally, if that's all true,
"worst aunt ever."

364
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:11,759
Now, I have got-- I have no problem--
the truth is, I've got no problem

365
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,079
making fun of the parents
accused of doing that

366
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:15,959
or the guy who ran that service.

367
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:18,639
Where it gets more complicated
is with the kids.

368
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,759
How much is it fair
to make fun of them?

369
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:25,359
Well, I would argue that one of them,
Olivia Jade, is a public figure.

370
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:28,399
She has nearly 1 1/2 million
followers on Instagram

371
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,359
and has worked with
all these companies.

372
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:32,759
She's actively made money
off her brand

373
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:36,839
as a fun, relatable college student,
releasing videos like this.

374
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:39,239
I don't know how much of school
I'm gonna attend,

375
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:43,559
but I do want the experience
of, like, game days, partying...

376
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:46,359
I don't really care about school,
as you all know.

377
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:51,519
Okay, so even before what we learned
this week, that was a little tone-deaf,

378
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,719
although not quite as tone-deaf as this
sponsored post she made for Amazon,

379
00:19:55,879 --> 00:20:00,599
in which she's decorated her dorm room
at USC with the letters "OJ."

380
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:05,599
And if you don't see a connection
between the letters OJ and USC,

381
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,719
maybe it should cost $1/2 million
to get you in there.

382
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:12,839
Now, I'm comfortable
making those jokes.

383
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:16,239
Am I comfortable with the whole internet
piling on her?

384
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:19,679
Honestly, that kind of depends on how
and for how long.

385
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,679
If it's death threats and vile comments,
then of course not.

386
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:25,279
If it defines her forever,
that seems unfair.

387
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:27,919
The window for making fun of her
is probably closing,

388
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:30,879
although it should stay open just enough
for me to tell you

389
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,519
one person went to
her Sephora makeup product page

390
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,239
and left a one-star review reading,

391
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:38,519
"I thought this would give me
the 'just came from crew practice,'

392
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:42,439
"'spent hours rowing on the lake' glow.
Turns out it was all a sham!"

393
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:45,479
Because that was excellent.

394
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:47,599
Just mwah.

395
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,959
But look, that is
the difficult thing here.

396
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:55,079
When joining in a pile-on,
there's a lot to take into account.

397
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:57,919
And when millions of people
all feel the need to weigh in

398
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:59,879
and do it potentially for years,

399
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:03,319
the punishment can be vastly
disproportionate to the offense.

400
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:06,439
And perhaps the best example
of this is Monica Lewinsky.

401
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,759
Two decades ago, this country
put her through hell,

402
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,799
as she'll be the first to tell you.

403
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:16,599
Overnight, I went from being
a completely private figure

404
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:21,479
to a publically humiliated one
worldwide.

405
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,879
I was patient zero of losing
a personal reputation

406
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:29,679
on a global scale
almost instantaneously.

407
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,999
Wow.
That has to be terrifying.

408
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,399
Although, in fairness,
almost everything is scary

409
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,079
when you add the phrase
"on a global scale."

410
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:38,799
If I said, "Karen's ophthalmologist

411
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:42,239
"says she's gonna need reading glasses
on a global scale,"

412
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:46,319
you would rightly think, "What the fuck
is going on with Karen's eyes?"

413
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:47,879
But look, she's not wrong.

414
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:50,239
And if you're hazy on
the Monica Lewinsky story,

415
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:54,439
at 22, she and President Clinton began
a relationship that, long story short,

416
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:56,759
ended up with graphic details
being made public

417
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:59,319
through the report
by independent counsel Ken Starr.

418
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:02,999
And it is impossible to overstate
just how globally famous

419
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:05,599
Monica and private details
of her life became.

420
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:08,359
The media obsessed over
every angle of her story,

421
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:10,239
from tabloid stories like these,

422
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:14,479
to cartoons where microphones pointed
at her face were replaced with penises,

423
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:16,519
to endless late night comedy jokes.

424
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:19,199
Look, my hands are not
clean here, either.

425
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,999
I wasn't in the U.S. then,
but ten years after the fact,

426
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,679
I was in a "Daily Show" piece marking
the 10th anniversary of the scandal

427
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:30,319
above a graphic reading "Ten suckin'
years," which is gross. It's gross.

428
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:33,519
And many comedians have since
publically expressed regret

429
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,199
about things they said,
although one who hasn't,

430
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:39,639
and who was among the most relentless,
was Jay Leno.

431
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:41,479
Let's see what's going on with Monica

432
00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:44,599
or, as President Clinton
calls her, "my little humidor."

433
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:46,559
1 million samples of DNA.

434
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:48,839
The largest collection of DNA
in the world,

435
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:50,719
not counting Monica Lewinsky's closet.

436
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:52,999
And the humidity--
man, I'll tell you,

437
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:57,278
people's clothes are stickier than
Monica Lewinsky's. Man, it was just...

438
00:22:57,438 --> 00:23:00,878
You can't get away without one of these:
Lewinsky back on her feet.

439
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:02,438
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

440
00:23:02,598 --> 00:23:04,918
And the Grammy
for Best Organ Recital

441
00:23:05,078 --> 00:23:08,798
went to Monica Lewinsky,
ladies and gentlemen.

442
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:13,158
Those jokes have not dated well
in any sense of the word.

443
00:23:13,318 --> 00:23:15,918
And they're pretty rough,
especially coming from a guy

444
00:23:16,078 --> 00:23:18,718
who just this week complained
about late night TV,

445
00:23:18,878 --> 00:23:21,558
saying he'd like to see
"a bit of civility come back."

446
00:23:21,718 --> 00:23:24,318
Like that time that
he did a bit with a fake book

447
00:23:24,478 --> 00:23:26,958
about Lewinsky titled,
"The Slut in the Hat."

448
00:23:27,118 --> 00:23:30,558
And if that's what he means by civility,
may I offer my new book,

449
00:23:30,718 --> 00:23:33,238
"Oh, the Places You Can
Go Fuck Yourself, Jay Leno!"

450
00:23:33,398 --> 00:23:35,758
Look--look how civil I'm being.

451
00:23:35,918 --> 00:23:38,238
Look how civil this is.

452
00:23:38,398 --> 00:23:42,838
Given that, it's frankly a miracle that
Lewinsky seems to have emerged

453
00:23:42,998 --> 00:23:45,998
with her sense of humor,
because when someone recently tweeted,

454
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,158
"I don't know who
Monica Lewinsky is,"

455
00:23:48,318 --> 00:23:52,678
she replied, "I'm the chick
from over 125 rap songs,"

456
00:23:52,838 --> 00:23:56,238
which is both very funny
and also technically true,

457
00:23:56,398 --> 00:23:58,798
because she's referenced
in all these songs.

458
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:02,598
We actually found 193 of them,
and that is-- and this may shock you--

459
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:05,238
significantly more rap songs
than have mentioned me.

460
00:24:05,398 --> 00:24:08,598
And to be honest, that kind of feels
like a personal slight.

461
00:24:08,758 --> 00:24:11,118
You know what's an easy name to rhyme?
John.

462
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:14,038
I'll show you:
begone, swan, Louis Vuitton,

463
00:24:14,198 --> 00:24:16,838
beef bourguignon,
lots of options there.

464
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:19,478
You know what's also
pretty tight rhyme-wise? Oliver.

465
00:24:19,638 --> 00:24:21,398
Don't want a piece, I want all of her.

466
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:23,318
Hittin' all the spots like John Oliver.

467
00:24:23,478 --> 00:24:25,438
You can have that for free, rappers.

468
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:29,038
You know what rhymes with Lewinsky?
Almost nothing.

469
00:24:29,198 --> 00:24:32,398
But look, the point isn't that
I should be in more rap songs,

470
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:34,558
although I absolutely should.

471
00:24:34,718 --> 00:24:37,398
It's that Lewinsky went through
absolute hell

472
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:39,878
to get to the point where
she could make that joke

473
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:41,878
about being the woman
from the rap songs.

474
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:44,518
And it can be easy to forget
just how ferocious

475
00:24:44,678 --> 00:24:47,038
and devastating
the public attention was.

476
00:24:47,998 --> 00:24:50,118
Hey, pal, get your arms off her!

477
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:53,638
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>how to begin to describe...</i>

478
00:24:55,438 --> 00:24:58,798
<i>What it was.</i>
<i>But it was to see my face on TV,</i>

479
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:03,318
<i>to--to read my name</i>
<i>in the newspaper.</i>

480
00:25:03,478 --> 00:25:08,798
People have no idea what--

481
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:10,718
what this has done.

482
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,558
What this has done.

483
00:25:13,718 --> 00:25:16,358
Behind the name Monica Lewinsky,

484
00:25:16,518 --> 00:25:19,558
there's a person
and there is a family

485
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:23,598
and there has been so much pain
that has been caused by all this.

486
00:25:23,758 --> 00:25:26,598
And it is...

487
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:29,678
It was so...

488
00:25:31,598 --> 00:25:34,638
Destructive, was so destructive.

489
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:38,078
That's horrifying,
and it's impossible to imagine

490
00:25:38,238 --> 00:25:41,358
how bad that was,
but for a second, just try.

491
00:25:41,518 --> 00:25:43,638
Think of the dumbest thing
you did in youth.

492
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:47,198
Not the dumbest thing you got caught
doing, the dumbest thing you did.

493
00:25:47,358 --> 00:25:49,158
The thing you stole, or cheated on,

494
00:25:49,318 --> 00:25:52,158
or accidentally sexted,
and again, I am sorry, Mom.

495
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:55,758
Now, imagine hearing about that

496
00:25:55,918 --> 00:25:58,438
every single day for decades on end.

497
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,438
It's a little bit of what it was like
to be Monica Lewinsky.

498
00:26:01,598 --> 00:26:05,438
And I know everything about the subject
of public shaming is complicated.

499
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:08,078
But Monica Lewinsky might be
the perfect person

500
00:26:08,238 --> 00:26:10,798
to remind all of us
what the consequences can be

501
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:13,358
to a misdirected flood
of public anger.

502
00:26:13,518 --> 00:26:16,798
I know this because I sat down
with Monica earlier this week,

503
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:18,358
and this is what happened.

504
00:26:18,518 --> 00:26:22,358
<i>21 years ago, Monica Lewinsky</i>
<i>was at the center of a media frenzy.</i>

505
00:26:22,518 --> 00:26:25,798
<i>In recent years, she's reemerged</i>
<i>as a major voice on online shaming</i>

506
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:27,438
<i>and anti-bullying initiatives.</i>

507
00:26:27,598 --> 00:26:29,558
<i>And she was kind enough</i>
<i>to sit down with me</i>

508
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:32,238
<i>in a fancy apartment</i>
<i>that neither of us live in.</i>

509
00:26:32,398 --> 00:26:35,398
So in the last few years,
you've been doing a lot of work

510
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:37,558
related to bullying
and people being shamed.

511
00:26:37,718 --> 00:26:40,518
- You think the issue has gotten worse?
- Absolutely.

512
00:26:40,678 --> 00:26:44,718
I think that with the advent of the
internet and, of course, social media,

513
00:26:44,878 --> 00:26:46,998
we now have situations

514
00:26:47,158 --> 00:26:49,998
where it's exacerbated
beyond, I think,

515
00:26:50,158 --> 00:26:52,238
what anybody could have imagined.

516
00:26:52,398 --> 00:26:55,078
And the anonymity that comes with that,

517
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:58,758
that sort of unleashed
these whole new personas for people.

518
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:02,197
Yeah, it's sad, isn't it?
If you have a chance to come up with

519
00:27:02,357 --> 00:27:06,517
a second persona, you decide to come up
with one that's a fucking monster.

520
00:27:06,677 --> 00:27:07,997
Yeah, exactly.

521
00:27:08,157 --> 00:27:09,797
"How much of an asshole can I be?"

522
00:27:09,957 --> 00:27:14,197
"I'm gonna amplify every worst aspect
of my personality by 100."

523
00:27:14,357 --> 00:27:18,277
Would you agree that somewhere
on the spectrum of shame,

524
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:20,557
there can be positive effects to it?

525
00:27:20,717 --> 00:27:22,757
I mean people
whose bad behavior hurts others

526
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:25,397
and who might not change it
without public attention.

527
00:27:25,557 --> 00:27:27,077
Yeah, it's interesting.

528
00:27:27,237 --> 00:27:29,397
I've spent a lot of time
thinking about this.

529
00:27:29,557 --> 00:27:34,117
And we tend to look at it as this kind
of, um, like a binary question, right?

530
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,997
Should we public shame
or shouldn't we?

531
00:27:36,157 --> 00:27:39,157
I do think there's a spectrum
of behavior

532
00:27:39,317 --> 00:27:42,877
on which we could kind of
sort of judge as a society.

533
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:44,877
Is this where shaming is effective

534
00:27:45,037 --> 00:27:48,037
to change social behavior
or is it damaging?

535
00:27:48,197 --> 00:27:51,037
You were on the receiving end
of one of the worst

536
00:27:51,197 --> 00:27:53,557
internet-fueled public shamings
of all time,

537
00:27:53,717 --> 00:27:56,117
- ...and hopefully, in a way, ever.
- Mm-hmm.

538
00:27:56,277 --> 00:27:59,277
How the fuck
did you get through that?

539
00:27:59,437 --> 00:28:03,877
Yeah. I, um...
I don't actually know. You know?

540
00:28:04,037 --> 00:28:06,117
- Really?
- I mean, it was a shitstorm.

541
00:28:06,277 --> 00:28:09,597
It was an avalanche
of pain and humiliation,

542
00:28:09,757 --> 00:28:14,157
and obviously, I could not have gotten
through it without my family.

543
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:17,277
And when I was allowed to talk
to my friends, my friends, too.

544
00:28:17,437 --> 00:28:20,597
And I think at 24 years old,

545
00:28:20,757 --> 00:28:22,917
it was, you know,

546
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:27,597
really hard to hold on
to a shred of dignity

547
00:28:27,757 --> 00:28:31,357
or self-esteem when, you know,

548
00:28:31,517 --> 00:28:34,197
you're the butt of so many jokes
and being misunderstood.

549
00:28:34,357 --> 00:28:37,437
Right, as everything escalated,
all the reaction to it,

550
00:28:37,597 --> 00:28:41,677
what's it like to see this character
of yourself that has your face and name,

551
00:28:41,837 --> 00:28:44,877
but bears less and less
relevance to who you actually are?

552
00:28:45,037 --> 00:28:48,317
Yeah, it was so bizarre.
I mean, it was just--it was...

553
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:52,677
I say extraordinary not with
any positive connotation.

554
00:28:52,837 --> 00:28:55,637
And I think it was not only
just the slut-shaming,

555
00:28:55,797 --> 00:28:59,597
not only, you know, having had
an intimate relationship

556
00:28:59,757 --> 00:29:02,077
with someone who is now
describing me in way

557
00:29:02,237 --> 00:29:04,757
that no young woman
would want to be described.

558
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:07,437
- Sure.
- There was just also my looks.

559
00:29:07,597 --> 00:29:10,997
I, you know, was very about
the touch-ups and the makeup,

560
00:29:11,157 --> 00:29:13,197
'cause I'm--like,
part of my vanity now

561
00:29:13,357 --> 00:29:18,357
comes from just the wound
of having been made fun of

562
00:29:18,517 --> 00:29:21,517
for my weight, for, you know,

563
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:24,037
people saying I was unattractive.

564
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:26,317
And it was terrifying,
not only because

565
00:29:26,477 --> 00:29:29,357
I was watching myself

566
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,037
or this version of myself
running away from me.

567
00:29:32,197 --> 00:29:35,237
I mean, stolen. My identity was stolen
in a different way.

568
00:29:35,397 --> 00:29:37,117
Not to say that I wasn't flawed,

569
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:39,837
that I didn't make mistakes,
or do stupid things,

570
00:29:39,997 --> 00:29:41,677
or say stupid things,
of course I did.

571
00:29:41,837 --> 00:29:44,237
- You were 22.
- Right, so...

572
00:29:44,397 --> 00:29:48,357
Every 22-year-old
is some version of an idiot.

573
00:29:48,517 --> 00:29:51,197
You just lost a lot
of viewers, John.

574
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:52,797
- So...
- That's true.

575
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,357
- Just let me--
- Cut that.

576
00:29:54,517 --> 00:29:57,197
Not you. Whichever 22-year-old
is listening now, not you.

577
00:29:57,357 --> 00:30:00,597
Not you.
But--so I mean, it's not--

578
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,997
it's not like I was this,
you know, perfect angel, right?

579
00:30:04,157 --> 00:30:07,717
But I watched
this sort of deconstruction of me

580
00:30:07,877 --> 00:30:11,117
and rebuilding of me.
It's like a transformer, almost.

581
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:15,117
Many victims of public shaming say it
affects their ability to earn a living.

582
00:30:15,277 --> 00:30:17,757
- Did that happen to you?
- Oh, 150%.

583
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:20,357
I mean, I couldn't get a job.

584
00:30:20,517 --> 00:30:22,997
Actually, it was, you know,
it was interesting,

585
00:30:23,157 --> 00:30:27,157
because I went to graduate school
in 2005 and graduated in 2006,

586
00:30:27,317 --> 00:30:30,397
and I thought, "Oh, okay,
now I will begin my life."

587
00:30:30,557 --> 00:30:33,237
I will now put being
"Monica Lewinsky" behind me

588
00:30:33,397 --> 00:30:36,677
and move on to be
so-and-so's employee.

589
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:39,277
And when I couldn't
find a job, you know,

590
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:41,917
either someone offered me
a job for the wrong reasons

591
00:30:42,077 --> 00:30:43,957
like, "Oh, you'll be coming
to our events.

592
00:30:44,117 --> 00:30:47,077
That's your job, and there's
media there," you know?

593
00:30:47,237 --> 00:30:48,757
Or it's people saying to me,

594
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:53,437
the opposite: "Could you get a letter
of indemnification from the Clintons?"

595
00:30:53,597 --> 00:30:56,877
"We rely on government money
and Hillary might be president."

596
00:30:57,037 --> 00:31:03,516
So I mean, there was this wide range
of not being able to support myself

597
00:31:03,676 --> 00:31:07,236
and also have a purpose,
which is equally important,

598
00:31:07,396 --> 00:31:11,236
to feel that you matter in some way.

599
00:31:11,396 --> 00:31:13,876
Is it tough sometimes to get through--

600
00:31:14,036 --> 00:31:16,676
- A typical day?
- Yes. The answer is yes.

601
00:31:16,836 --> 00:31:19,036
Yes, it is tough anytime.
Sorry.

602
00:31:19,196 --> 00:31:22,676
That's probably a fair response
to basically most of the things here.

603
00:31:22,836 --> 00:31:25,276
Is it tough sometimes
to get through a typical day

604
00:31:25,436 --> 00:31:26,876
without having to deal with this?

605
00:31:27,036 --> 00:31:30,356
'Cause the ubiquity of references to you
is incredible.

606
00:31:30,516 --> 00:31:33,996
Yeah, it's insane.
I think, you know, and in part,

607
00:31:34,156 --> 00:31:37,396
a lot of that happened
because of this, you know,

608
00:31:37,556 --> 00:31:39,156
sexist, really, thing that happened,

609
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:42,596
which is that the scandal was named
after me, became named after me.

610
00:31:42,756 --> 00:31:45,116
It meant that anytime that
this has been referenced

611
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:48,956
every single day, every single day
in the past 20 years--

612
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,356
so it may not be
a direct reference to me,

613
00:31:51,516 --> 00:31:55,036
but because the investigation
and the scandal has my name,

614
00:31:55,196 --> 00:31:57,076
I'm then therefore attached to it.

615
00:31:57,236 --> 00:32:00,996
- Did you consider changing your name?
- There were several reasons I didn't.

616
00:32:01,156 --> 00:32:04,676
First of all, I don't think
that it really would have worked.

617
00:32:04,836 --> 00:32:07,716
Like, when I was job hunting,
people even suggested,

618
00:32:07,876 --> 00:32:10,836
"Why don't you put a different name
on your CV when you're..."

619
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:13,996
I thought, so I'm gonna walk
into an office for an interview,

620
00:32:14,156 --> 00:32:16,156
and the person's gonna be like,
"What?

621
00:32:16,316 --> 00:32:18,156
That person looks like
Monica Lewinsky."

622
00:32:18,316 --> 00:32:22,076
And be wondering, and you're starting
a professional relationship on a lie.

623
00:32:22,236 --> 00:32:23,596
So there's not that.

624
00:32:23,756 --> 00:32:27,276
And then lastly,
I think it was also a principle.

625
00:32:27,436 --> 00:32:29,836
I mean Bill Clinton
didn't have to change his name.

626
00:32:29,996 --> 00:32:33,636
Nobody's ever asked him,
did he think he should change his name.

627
00:32:33,796 --> 00:32:38,036
And so I think that that was
an important statement, you know?

628
00:32:38,196 --> 00:32:41,956
I'm not proud of all of the choices
I've made in my life,

629
00:32:42,116 --> 00:32:45,396
but I'm proud of the person I am.
I'm not ashamed of who I am.

630
00:32:45,556 --> 00:32:50,916
And I think that it'is-- as hard as it's
been to have that last name sometimes

631
00:32:51,076 --> 00:32:53,636
and the pain that I have felt
of what it's meant

632
00:32:53,796 --> 00:32:58,596
for the other people in my family
who have that last name...

633
00:32:58,756 --> 00:33:00,476
I am glad I didn't change it.

634
00:33:00,636 --> 00:33:04,356
I definitely don't have your courage
or strength of character--

635
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:06,356
Honestly, I believe you don't know that.

636
00:33:06,516 --> 00:33:11,556
Oh, no, I already have a mental list
of fake names that I'm going to do.

637
00:33:11,716 --> 00:33:15,476
Alvin, I like... It's not a great name,
but I think I can carry it off.

638
00:33:15,636 --> 00:33:17,996
No, you actually could
carry off Alvin.

639
00:33:18,156 --> 00:33:20,716
Thank you, Monica.
I think I could too.

640
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:22,476
But I don't know about
Alvin Oliver.

641
00:33:22,636 --> 00:33:24,876
- That's a lot.
- True. That's not great.

642
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:30,116
My second one was Jacks, no surname,
no explanation, just Jacks.

643
00:33:30,276 --> 00:33:32,956
I like that.
I could get behind that one.

644
00:33:33,116 --> 00:33:35,836
So let's talk a bit about,
like, laughing.

645
00:33:35,996 --> 00:33:37,996
You joke about your experiences.

646
00:33:38,156 --> 00:33:41,316
How long was it
before you could do that?

647
00:33:41,476 --> 00:33:43,916
I think there were stages,
you know,

648
00:33:44,076 --> 00:33:46,596
or things that have happened
a couple years ago.

649
00:33:46,756 --> 00:33:49,956
A friend of mine had--
she and her friend

650
00:33:50,116 --> 00:33:54,836
had a 25th friend-iversary party,
and they had met in the '90s.

651
00:33:54,996 --> 00:33:57,236
So this party that they had
for all their friends

652
00:33:57,396 --> 00:34:00,076
to celebrate their friendship,
started in the '90s,

653
00:34:00,236 --> 00:34:03,476
meant everybody had to come
dressed from the '90s.

654
00:34:03,636 --> 00:34:05,996
I was like, "Oh, shit," you know.

655
00:34:06,156 --> 00:34:09,796
So I just thought, "Okay," you know.

656
00:34:09,956 --> 00:34:12,636
So for the first time
in about 18 years,

657
00:34:12,796 --> 00:34:16,796
I donned a black beret
and went to my friend's party.

658
00:34:16,956 --> 00:34:20,036
You know, in part,
'cause I thought it was funny.

659
00:34:20,196 --> 00:34:22,116
- Oh, it's definitely funny.
- Right.

660
00:34:22,276 --> 00:34:26,596
Is that not a marker for actually having
come a long way, though?

661
00:34:26,756 --> 00:34:30,876
That you're able to actively
participate in humor

662
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:32,556
connected to what
you went through,

663
00:34:32,716 --> 00:34:35,356
which, again, to reiterate,
was clearly awful.

664
00:34:35,516 --> 00:34:39,436
Yeah.
Like, beret things, I can laugh at.

665
00:34:39,596 --> 00:34:43,356
Other item of clothing, jokes,
not as much.

666
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:46,196
What is your experience
of the internet now?

667
00:34:46,356 --> 00:34:49,276
'Cause you're on Twitter now,
and you're very funny on there.

668
00:34:49,436 --> 00:34:52,676
- Thank you.
- So how did you decide to go on it?

669
00:34:52,836 --> 00:34:55,636
I guess some of the times
I get really deflated

670
00:34:55,796 --> 00:35:00,316
watching you tweet something funny and
making the mistake of scrolling down.

671
00:35:00,476 --> 00:35:03,356
- Oh, yeah.
- It can become a sewer pretty fast.

672
00:35:03,516 --> 00:35:08,115
Yeah, it can. I mean, I get a lot of
empowerment out of blocking people.

673
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:10,995
I wish people would not say
shitty things, but they do.

674
00:35:11,155 --> 00:35:12,595
- Right?
- Sure.

675
00:35:12,755 --> 00:35:15,675
And literally to me, it's like,
when I block someone,

676
00:35:15,835 --> 00:35:17,595
- I'm, like, going...
- Oh, really?

677
00:35:17,755 --> 00:35:19,435
That's what it feels like for me.

678
00:35:19,595 --> 00:35:22,315
I'm basically telling someone
to fuck off. It feels great.

679
00:35:22,475 --> 00:35:24,275
I wish they hadn't said something

680
00:35:24,435 --> 00:35:26,115
that would make me want
to block them,

681
00:35:26,275 --> 00:35:28,755
but blocking is
unbelievably empowering.

682
00:35:28,915 --> 00:35:33,235
Actually, I was lucky in some ways
that social media wasn't around.

683
00:35:33,395 --> 00:35:35,955
I think that would have made it worse
in some ways--

684
00:35:36,115 --> 00:35:37,835
- Could it have made it worse?
- Well--

685
00:35:37,995 --> 00:35:40,475
Have you not maxed out
how bad it could be?

686
00:35:40,635 --> 00:35:42,995
Do you really think it could
have got worse? Maybe.

687
00:35:43,155 --> 00:35:44,875
You know what? I don't know.

688
00:35:45,035 --> 00:35:48,955
It might have been worse in the sense
that there certainly would have been

689
00:35:49,115 --> 00:35:51,195
a lot more opinions
that were out there.

690
00:35:51,355 --> 00:35:54,235
But where it may have been
better would have been that,

691
00:35:54,395 --> 00:35:57,515
I think, I would have
heard some support from people.

692
00:35:57,675 --> 00:35:59,675
It might've been
a bit more balanced.

693
00:35:59,835 --> 00:36:02,755
So would it have been really
meaningful to you, at the time,

694
00:36:02,915 --> 00:36:06,595
had social media been around just
to have a stranger tweet something like,

695
00:36:06,755 --> 00:36:08,995
"I think what you're going
through is bullshit"?

696
00:36:09,155 --> 00:36:12,995
Yeah, yeah, it would.
Absolutely.

697
00:36:13,155 --> 00:36:14,955
Because one of the things
that happens

698
00:36:15,115 --> 00:36:18,835
with these kinds of experiences
is that you start to disappear.

699
00:36:18,995 --> 00:36:20,755
You start to feel like
you don't matter.

700
00:36:20,915 --> 00:36:23,795
And I think that when
somebody sees you,

701
00:36:23,955 --> 00:36:28,235
you know, and just acknowledges
your humanity in the smallest way,

702
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:30,035
it can make
a world of difference.

703
00:36:30,195 --> 00:36:33,995
And you don't know, it could help save
someone's life, and that's important.

704
00:36:34,155 --> 00:36:36,075
What would your advice be to someone

705
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:39,875
who's either in the eye right now
of the storm of public shaming

706
00:36:40,035 --> 00:36:42,355
or a kid who's being humiliated
at school, online?

707
00:36:42,515 --> 00:36:44,075
Anything you'd be able to tell them

708
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,915
from your personal experience
that nobody else could?

709
00:36:47,075 --> 00:36:51,315
The first thing I'd probably say is that
you can get through it, move past it.

710
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:53,835
I know it feels like
in this one moment

711
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:58,595
that your life will forever be defined
by this, but it won't.

712
00:36:58,755 --> 00:37:00,075
And it may be hard.

713
00:37:00,235 --> 00:37:03,315
It may take more time
than you ever could have imagined,

714
00:37:03,475 --> 00:37:05,795
but you can move past
something like this.

715
00:37:05,955 --> 00:37:08,395
Monica Lewinsky,
thanks a lot for talking with me.

716
00:37:08,555 --> 00:37:11,915
Thank you, Alvin Oliver.
No, I'm kidding, sorry.

717
00:37:12,075 --> 00:37:13,755
Or Jacks.

718
00:37:15,195 --> 00:37:16,915
That's our show.
Thanks for watching.

719
00:37:17,075 --> 00:37:20,115
We're off next week, back after that.
Good night!
