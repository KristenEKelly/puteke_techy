1
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,160
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

2
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,040
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

3
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,441
Time for a quick recap of the week.
It was a very busy one abroad,

4
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:40,321
with North Korea reportedly
planning new missile launches,

5
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:42,961
Theresa May still trying
to work out the Brexit mess,

6
00:00:43,121 --> 00:00:46,642
and Justin Trudeau up to his cheekbones
in a major scandal.

7
00:00:46,802 --> 00:00:49,922
But I'd like to focus
on what happened this week in Brazil;

8
00:00:50,082 --> 00:00:52,162
a country whose anaconda
don't want none

9
00:00:52,322 --> 00:00:55,722
unless it's a tourist who got
too close to the river.

10
00:00:55,882 --> 00:00:57,802
Carnival wrapped up
in Brazil this week,

11
00:00:57,962 --> 00:01:01,923
and Jair Bolsonaro, their new far-right
leader and sun-dried Frankie Muniz,

12
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:06,323
got a lot of attention on Wednesday
for an unexpected attack on the event.

13
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,443
The festivities have been
denounced as "debaucherous"

14
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,604
by the President,
who tweeted a video

15
00:01:11,764 --> 00:01:13,804
apparently filmed at
a Carnival event showing

16
00:01:13,964 --> 00:01:17,124
one man urinating on another man
in a sexual act.

17
00:01:17,284 --> 00:01:18,844
We won't show the video.

18
00:01:19,004 --> 00:01:22,445
Oh, you're not, are you?
Well, guess what. We're not afraid.

19
00:01:22,605 --> 00:01:26,045
We are gonna show it to you,
except of course we're not.

20
00:01:26,205 --> 00:01:29,125
What are you cheering for?
No, we're not!

21
00:01:29,285 --> 00:01:30,605
This is HBO.

22
00:01:30,765 --> 00:01:33,725
This company doesn't show
debaucherous sex for the hell of it,

23
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:36,486
unless a dragon is also there
to make it okay.

24
00:01:36,646 --> 00:01:38,046
That is the clear rule.

25
00:01:38,206 --> 00:01:41,166
What we'll do to give you a sense
of what the video contained,

26
00:01:41,326 --> 00:01:43,686
is utilize the YouTube channel
"Squirting Mustard."

27
00:01:43,846 --> 00:01:46,327
If you're not familiar with it,
and you're not,

28
00:01:46,487 --> 00:01:49,847
it's a series of videos of someone
squirting mustard on objects.

29
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:52,887
So, to give you a basic idea
of what Bolsonaro tweeted,

30
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:54,767
it was essentially this.

31
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:03,368
That's it, and you can picture that in
your head for the rest of the segment,

32
00:02:03,528 --> 00:02:06,688
as well as every time you eat a hot dog
for the rest of your life.

33
00:02:06,848 --> 00:02:10,009
And as if tweeting out a golden shower
video weren't weird enough,

34
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,449
Bolsonaro added the caption...

35
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:18,129
Which, you know, can do, Jair.

36
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:20,329
My comment is,
"What the fuck are you doing?"

37
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:23,690
And my conclusion is,
"You're a terrible president."

38
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,170
Why did Bolsonaro do this?

39
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,210
He may have been angry that many of this
year's Carnival revelers roasted him.

40
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,330
For instance, one city paraded
giant puppets of celebrities,

41
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,731
and Bolsonaro's received
a decidedly mixed reaction,

42
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:37,931
with crowds not just flipping it off

43
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,931
<i>as it waddled through the streets,</i>

44
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:44,051
<i>but also pelting it with so much beer,</i>
<i>it needed to be wiped down.</i>

45
00:02:44,211 --> 00:02:47,532
And it is not a great sign when your
puppet is singled out for abuse,

46
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:49,492
especially when, for some reason,

47
00:02:49,652 --> 00:02:53,012
it's marching in a group that includes
a puppet Michael Jackson.

48
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:56,732
And how much work must have
gone into that puppet

49
00:02:56,892 --> 00:03:00,373
that they still brought it out
after the documentary?

50
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:02,373
"Look, I've already sunk
weeks into this.

51
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:04,453
"The documentary doesn't
tell us anything

52
00:03:04,613 --> 00:03:06,533
"that as a society
we haven't been aware of

53
00:03:06,693 --> 00:03:09,334
"and repressed since 1993.
If you're getting angry now,

54
00:03:09,494 --> 00:03:11,974
"you're either disingenuously
riding the social wave,

55
00:03:12,134 --> 00:03:15,494
or you're incredibly
fucking naive. Carnival!"

56
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:20,574
But honestly, a more likely reason
for Bolsonaro tweeting that video

57
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:23,935
was probably an attempt
to change the conversation in Brazil,

58
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:27,215
because things are not
going well there for him.

59
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,695
He's only been in office
a little over two months,

60
00:03:29,855 --> 00:03:33,576
but his administration's
approval rating is at just 39%.

61
00:03:33,736 --> 00:03:36,056
So he could be trying
to deflect from that

62
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,816
by going back to what he does best:

63
00:03:37,976 --> 00:03:40,456
Engaging in homophobic
cultural bullshit.

64
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:42,216
It is very much his brand.

65
00:03:42,376 --> 00:03:46,257
And incredibly, despite all the blowback
he got for tweeting the video,

66
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:48,737
he responded the next day
by tweeting,

67
00:03:48,897 --> 00:03:51,017
"What is a golden shower?"

68
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:55,097
And you know it has been
a weird, weird week

69
00:03:55,257 --> 00:03:59,938
when the leader of 209 million
people is asking Twitter

70
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:03,858
a question that you'd expect
Gayle King to be asking R. Kelly.

71
00:04:04,018 --> 00:04:08,178
So meanwhile, back home,
we were all dealing with Donald Trump,

72
00:04:08,338 --> 00:04:11,339
who will one day be remembered
by his great-great grandchildren

73
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:14,019
as the reason they had to change
their last names.

74
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:17,139
This week, the Trump TV show
we're all forced to live in

75
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,059
jumped the shark for the 485th time.

76
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:22,420
<i>The President and First Lady</i>
<i>stopped in Alabama,</i>

77
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,500
<i>where they toured</i>
<i>some of the damage caused</i>

78
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,020
<i>by tornadoes that killed 23 people.</i>

79
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,740
<i>The President also stopping</i>
<i>at a Baptist church,</i>

80
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,860
<i>and that is where he signed</i>
<i>several bibles.</i>

81
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,541
<i>Administration officials say</i>
<i>people there asked him</i>

82
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:37,621
<i>to autograph the bibles</i>
<i>and that he happily complied.</i>

83
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:39,261
Of course he did.

84
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:41,701
I am not remotely surprised
that Trump did that.

85
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:45,462
I'm just slightly confused as to why
anyone would want him to.

86
00:04:45,622 --> 00:04:47,262
Seeing Trump's autograph on a bible

87
00:04:47,422 --> 00:04:49,342
should be like seeing
a picture of your mom

88
00:04:49,502 --> 00:04:51,662
on the cover
of a "Penthouse" magazine.

89
00:04:51,822 --> 00:04:53,662
It should render
the whole thing useless,

90
00:04:53,822 --> 00:04:55,862
and if you keep reading
after discovering it,

91
00:04:56,022 --> 00:04:58,063
you're going directly to hell.

92
00:04:58,223 --> 00:05:01,223
And look, some people there
clearly wanted his autograph,

93
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:03,263
and presidents have signed
bibles before.

94
00:05:03,423 --> 00:05:06,623
But Trump didn't just sign the book,
he signed the cover.

95
00:05:06,783 --> 00:05:09,664
And it is weird to sign
the cover of any book,

96
00:05:09,824 --> 00:05:13,904
and weirder still to sign the cover
of The Bible with this signature.

97
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,064
'Cause I don't care what
your name is,

98
00:05:16,224 --> 00:05:18,104
that is not how you sign something.

99
00:05:18,264 --> 00:05:20,064
That's how you test that
your Sharpie

100
00:05:20,224 --> 00:05:23,305
still has ink left
before you sign something.

101
00:05:23,465 --> 00:05:25,945
I know it's easy to make jokes
about how Donald Trump

102
00:05:26,105 --> 00:05:28,945
has no idea what's inside a bible,
but that is only because,

103
00:05:29,105 --> 00:05:30,865
as we learned when
he ran for president,

104
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:34,546
he really has no idea
what is inside a bible.

105
00:05:34,706 --> 00:05:37,666
You've been talking about how
The Bible is your favorite book.

106
00:05:37,826 --> 00:05:40,986
You said, I think last night in Iowa,
some are surprised by that.

107
00:05:41,146 --> 00:05:44,227
I'm wondering what one or two
of your most favored

108
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:45,907
bible verses are and why?

109
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:48,307
I don't want to get into it,
it's very personal.

110
00:05:48,467 --> 00:05:51,747
When I talk about The Bible,
it's very personal, I don't wanna get--

111
00:05:51,907 --> 00:05:56,028
There's no verse that means a lot to you
that you think about or cite?

112
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:59,348
The Bible means a lot to me,
but I don't wanna get into specifics.

113
00:05:59,508 --> 00:06:01,508
- Even to cite a verse you like?
- No.

114
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:04,068
You an Old Testament guy
or a New Testament guy?

115
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:05,708
Probably equal.

116
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:12,829
Goddamn it, that is funny.
But think about what you're laughing at.

117
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:16,189
That is a future president joyfully
and transparently lying

118
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:18,109
about The Bible being his favorite book

119
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:21,670
and being unable to name
a single passage from it.

120
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,670
Which is amazing, 'cause just try.

121
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,990
"Let there be light."
"Do unto others..."

122
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,510
"God bless us every one."

123
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,910
That's "A Christmas Carol,"
but I think we'd all let him have it.

124
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,431
That exchange is emblematic
of something that happens a lot.

125
00:06:34,591 --> 00:06:36,751
It's Trump being a terrible
human being,

126
00:06:36,911 --> 00:06:40,391
dangerously idiotic, and yet somehow,
undeniably funny.

127
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:45,312
And it happened again on Wednesday,
when he said this to Apple CEO Tim Cook.

128
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:48,112
You've really put a big
investment in our country.

129
00:06:48,272 --> 00:06:50,512
We appreciate it very much,
Tim Apple.

130
00:06:50,672 --> 00:06:53,752
Yeah, yeah.
He called him Tim Apple.

131
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:57,993
Which, yes, yes, it's ridiculous.
But also, of course he did,

132
00:06:58,153 --> 00:07:01,233
'cause as far as Trump knows,
all companies are inherited.

133
00:07:01,393 --> 00:07:05,193
How else would a person
become CEO unless his father,

134
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:08,714
Fred Apple, had founded
a company using the family name

135
00:07:08,874 --> 00:07:11,674
and eventually handed it off
to his son, Tim Apple?

136
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:13,874
Isn't that how all businesses work?

137
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,874
But look, that is a funny mistake.

138
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:18,714
It's also genuinely worrying,
but it is funny.

139
00:07:18,874 --> 00:07:21,555
It's something I think
we all wrestle with at some point.

140
00:07:21,715 --> 00:07:23,955
How can a black-hearted moral vacuum

141
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:26,755
somehow retain the ability
to make us laugh

142
00:07:26,915 --> 00:07:28,875
in spite of everything
he's said and done?

143
00:07:29,035 --> 00:07:32,956
It's almost impressive. He called
white nationalists "very fine people,"

144
00:07:33,116 --> 00:07:34,436
which is horrifying.

145
00:07:34,596 --> 00:07:37,836
But he also tweeted "hamberders,"
and I'm not saying that

146
00:07:37,996 --> 00:07:39,956
cancels the first one out--
it doesn't--

147
00:07:40,116 --> 00:07:44,357
but it succeeds despite it, which,
in a way, is even more impressive.

148
00:07:44,517 --> 00:07:46,437
Do you know how funny you have to be

149
00:07:46,597 --> 00:07:49,477
to make people laugh
after co-signing on Nazis?

150
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:52,677
I'll tell you.
You've gotta be "hamberder" funny.

151
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:55,118
And Trump manages to do this
on a regular basis,

152
00:07:55,278 --> 00:07:58,318
like when he referred to
the Speaker of the House like this.

153
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,758
Nancy Pelosi, or Nancy,
as I call her.

154
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,638
Of course you call her Nancy.
Everyone calls her Nancy.

155
00:08:06,798 --> 00:08:08,959
It's her fucking name!

156
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,919
I don't know if that's a joke or not,

157
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,479
and it doesn't matter
at the end of the day.

158
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,119
'Cause it's moments like these
where the line between

159
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,399
"Donald Trump,
actual President of the US,"

160
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:21,480
and "Adam Sandler starring
in a '90s comedy with the premise,

161
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,680
"'What if the worst person
in the world was the President?'"

162
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,360
completely disappears. And it somehow
becomes physically confusing.

163
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,240
You can feel your spirit sinking

164
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,401
and your giggles rising
at the exact same time.

165
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:35,641
Because in the midst
of botching the response

166
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:39,161
to a devastating hurricane
in Puerto Rico, Trump said this.

167
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:41,521
This is an island...

168
00:08:41,681 --> 00:08:44,642
surrounded by water.

169
00:08:44,802 --> 00:08:46,962
Big water.
Ocean water.

170
00:08:47,122 --> 00:08:49,882
Oh, fuck you.
You got me again!

171
00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:53,962
You did "big water" as the setup,
and then you drop "ocean water" on me?

172
00:08:54,122 --> 00:08:57,083
A++, you pile of shit.

173
00:08:57,243 --> 00:08:59,003
There are so many moments like that

174
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,763
from the time he walked onto Air Force
One with toilet paper to his shoe

175
00:09:02,923 --> 00:09:05,683
to when he pronounced
regulators, "regul-a-tors,"

176
00:09:05,843 --> 00:09:07,764
like they were some kind
of dinosaur,

177
00:09:07,924 --> 00:09:10,924
to this incredible
foreign policy statement.

178
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:14,764
China has total respect
for Donald Trump

179
00:09:14,924 --> 00:09:19,765
and for Donald Trump's
very, very large a-brain.

180
00:09:19,925 --> 00:09:24,645
Goddamn it, that is spectacular.
Not only did you refer to yourself

181
00:09:24,805 --> 00:09:27,765
in the third person twice,
but you ended a sentence

182
00:09:27,925 --> 00:09:32,006
in which you're trying to come across
as a statesman with the word "a-brain."

183
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:35,766
Just imagine if any other
president had done that.

184
00:09:35,926 --> 00:09:39,206
"A house divided cannot
a-stand."

185
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:42,206
"Mr. Gorbachev,
tear down this a-wall."

186
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:46,487
"Speak softly and carry
a very large a-stick."

187
00:09:46,647 --> 00:09:50,767
It is the "my wife" cadence,
and he's doing it at the fucking U.N.

188
00:09:50,927 --> 00:09:54,408
I am actively ashamed of how funny
I still find him at times,

189
00:09:54,568 --> 00:09:56,768
and I cannot be alone
in struggling with this.

190
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:59,608
It's an emotion specific
to the Trump era,

191
00:09:59,768 --> 00:10:02,408
much like that rush
of excitement followed by futility

192
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,088
anytime that he's caught in a lie.

193
00:10:04,248 --> 00:10:07,529
We actually tried to embody that
with our "We Got Him" button,

194
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:10,449
which summoned a banner
and a dunking tiger.

195
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:13,409
But when he somehow manages
to make us laugh,

196
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:16,169
it's a feeling close
to the opposite of that.

197
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:17,769
Whether he's saying "Tim Apple"

198
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:21,610
or bragging about being on a first name
basis with Nancy Pelosi,

199
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,010
we have to say, reluctantly,

200
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,810
in spite of ourselves, he got us.

201
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,530
He got us.

202
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,931
He did, he did. He got us.
He got us.

203
00:10:31,091 --> 00:10:33,251
I don't like it either,
but he got us.

204
00:10:33,411 --> 00:10:37,491
To him, I say, check-a-mate,
you fucking monster.

205
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:39,811
And now this.

206
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:44,212
<i>And now, Rachael Ray's audience</i>
<i>really likes cheese.</i>

207
00:10:44,372 --> 00:10:50,412
And then finish it off with a nice
drizzle of wine and cheese sauce.

208
00:10:52,892 --> 00:10:56,133
With the cheese literally
coming out the sides. Look at that.

209
00:10:56,293 --> 00:10:57,933
I know!

210
00:10:58,093 --> 00:11:00,493
Who likes cheese balls?
I love cheese balls.

211
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:02,533
Cheese balls!

212
00:11:02,693 --> 00:11:05,734
Some Parmigiano
or pecorino cheese.

213
00:11:07,494 --> 00:11:09,854
With a lot of Swiss cheese.

214
00:11:12,414 --> 00:11:15,894
Take a piece of provolone cheese

215
00:11:16,054 --> 00:11:19,455
and nest it in the meatball.

216
00:11:19,615 --> 00:11:21,175
Yeah.

217
00:11:21,335 --> 00:11:22,655
How cute is that?

218
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:29,415
And hello, the cheese,
feta, baby, feta. Whoo!

219
00:11:29,576 --> 00:11:32,376
You need a fair amount
of cheese on top.

220
00:11:33,496 --> 00:11:35,496
- Double the cheese!
- Double cheese!

221
00:11:35,656 --> 00:11:37,416
You want some of this cheese
on the top?

222
00:11:37,576 --> 00:11:39,736
Yes, please!
Gimme some of that cheese.

223
00:11:39,896 --> 00:11:42,097
Oh, more cheese.

224
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:44,337
Let's add some cheese.
Handful of it.

225
00:11:44,497 --> 00:11:45,817
Cheese.
Parm cheese.

226
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:48,377
Cheese!
Cheese!

227
00:11:48,537 --> 00:11:50,777
-Cheese.
-Yeah.

228
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:06,659
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns robocalls,

229
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:08,739
tied for "most annoying type
of phone call"

230
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:11,019
with every other type of phone call.

231
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:13,019
Robocalls are clearly infuriating.

232
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:16,779
Every one of us has answered our phone
at some point to hear this.

233
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,060
<i>It is urgent that you contact us</i>

234
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,860
<i>concerning your eligibility for lowering</i>
<i>your interest rates.</i>

235
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:40,981
It was the pause in that last one
that made it a real cliffhanger.

236
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:42,862
You basically knew where it was going,

237
00:12:43,022 --> 00:12:45,982
but there was a chance they were calling
people to inform them

238
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:49,142
that the IRS was filing lawsuits
against... Nicolas Cage.

239
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,262
Which you assume is always true,

240
00:12:51,422 --> 00:12:53,983
but a call to confirm every now
and then would be nice.

241
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,863
The point is, everybody is
annoyed by robocalls.

242
00:12:57,023 --> 00:12:59,263
Hatred of them might be
the only thing that

243
00:12:59,423 --> 00:13:01,423
everyone in America agrees on now.

244
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:05,544
And if you're feeling like you've been
getting more recently, you're right.

245
00:13:05,704 --> 00:13:11,784
Robocalls increased by 57% in 2018
to nearly 50 billion calls,

246
00:13:11,944 --> 00:13:14,504
and it's understandably
pissing people off.

247
00:13:14,664 --> 00:13:17,345
The plague of robocalls
is getting worse.

248
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,345
<i>They're the number one</i>
<i>consumer complaint</i>

249
00:13:19,505 --> 00:13:21,425
<i>to the Federal Communications</i>
<i>Commission,</i>

250
00:13:21,585 --> 00:13:24,625
<i>which receives more than</i>
<i>200,000 protests a year.</i>

251
00:13:24,785 --> 00:13:29,866
<i>Robocalls make up roughly 60%</i>
<i>of all complaints to the FCC.</i>

252
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:33,666
60% of all complaints
to the FCC are about robocalls,

253
00:13:33,826 --> 00:13:36,066
so they're definitely aware
of the problem.

254
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:40,146
It's like the actual tea salon
in Vancouver called Neverland.

255
00:13:40,306 --> 00:13:43,787
By this point, they definitely know
they have a real issue.

256
00:13:43,947 --> 00:13:47,267
The only question is, what the fuck
are they gonna do about it?

257
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,067
The nuisance of robocalls
has gotten to the point where

258
00:13:50,227 --> 00:13:53,588
even local news reports
about them get interrupted.

259
00:13:53,748 --> 00:13:55,948
- What's that? Is that your phone?
- Yeah.

260
00:13:56,108 --> 00:13:59,468
<i>We can't even get through an interview</i>
<i>without an unwanted phone call.</i>

261
00:13:59,628 --> 00:14:03,428
-I'm getting a robocall right now.
<i>-Ugh, there you go.</i>

262
00:14:03,588 --> 00:14:06,149
<i>As I was preparing</i>
<i>this report, I got one.</i>

263
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:08,629
<i>Because you are qualified</i>
<i>for lower rates.</i>

264
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:11,869
It is just not often that a news report
gets interrupted

265
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:13,669
by the subject of that report.

266
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:16,830
"Is your teenager getting involved
in a strange new sex trend?

267
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,110
"It's called watermeloning,
and it involves--goddamn it.

268
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,270
Can you not do this
somewhere else?"

269
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:29,751
Let's look at why robocalls are on the
rise and what can be done about them.

270
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,831
Let's start with a basic definition.

271
00:14:31,991 --> 00:14:34,791
Robocalls are any call
where you hear a recording

272
00:14:34,951 --> 00:14:39,151
or a robot voice, or when a machine
automatically dialed your number,

273
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,552
even if there is a real person
on the other end.

274
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:44,112
While a small percentage
of robocalls may be useful,

275
00:14:44,272 --> 00:14:47,472
calls about things like school closings
or prescription reminders,

276
00:14:47,632 --> 00:14:52,032
the vast majority of them vary from
the irritating to the outright illegal.

277
00:14:52,193 --> 00:14:55,513
And you'd be surprised to know
how many major companies are involved.

278
00:14:55,673 --> 00:14:58,593
A list of top robocallers
includes Capital One,

279
00:14:58,753 --> 00:15:00,433
Comcast, and Wells Fargo;

280
00:15:00,593 --> 00:15:02,953
all of whom use robocalls
to chase debts.

281
00:15:03,113 --> 00:15:06,874
And sometimes they do that a lot,
as this woman can testify.

282
00:15:07,034 --> 00:15:08,594
<i>Lea Bourgeois never suspected</i>

283
00:15:08,754 --> 00:15:10,794
<i>one late mortgage payment</i>
<i>would trigger</i>

284
00:15:10,954 --> 00:15:13,994
<i>what she considers</i>
<i>an avalanche of harassment.</i>

285
00:15:14,154 --> 00:15:17,395
It came and I just--blew me away.

286
00:15:17,555 --> 00:15:21,075
<i>Lea's attorney say they've logged</i>
<i>over 6,000 calls from Wells Fargo</i>

287
00:15:21,235 --> 00:15:23,475
<i>to their client</i>
<i>over the last four years.</i>

288
00:15:23,635 --> 00:15:25,515
<i>Some days, such as in January,</i>

289
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:29,596
<i>Lea says Wells Fargo rang her</i>
<i>more than 20 times a day.</i>

290
00:15:29,756 --> 00:15:31,796
That's absolutely ridiculous.

291
00:15:31,956 --> 00:15:35,596
What's the point of calling someone
20 times a day to collect a debt?

292
00:15:35,756 --> 00:15:39,596
"This is actually great timing, 'cause
while I couldn't pay you 45 minutes ago,

293
00:15:39,757 --> 00:15:42,637
"a small propeller plane
full of unlaundered drug money

294
00:15:42,797 --> 00:15:44,317
"just crashed into my den.

295
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:48,037
Thanks so much for the call,
you ravenous ghouls."

296
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,758
But as you undoubtedly know, it is not
just major companies who do this.

297
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:55,318
Phone calls are so cheap
and the technology so widely available,

298
00:15:55,478 --> 00:15:59,518
that just about anyone has the ability
to place a massive number of calls.

299
00:15:59,678 --> 00:16:01,678
-You created a program on your laptop.
-Yes.

300
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:04,999
I'm gonna hit a button,
and the calls should start hitting.

301
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,799
All at once.

302
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,159
-This is insane; they're all ringing.
-Yep.

303
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:13,679
That's both very impressive
and, when you really think about it,

304
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,880
not actually that impressive at all.

305
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,000
It's basically the finale trick from the
world's least amusing birthday magician.

306
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,240
"Ta-da! Wait, nothing?
Well, guess what.

307
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,280
"The Great Laptop-Dini got paid
in advance, so fuck all of you."

308
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,601
And if you're thinking,
"What about the 'do not call' list?"

309
00:16:29,761 --> 00:16:33,641
It still exists, and very occasionally,
a big company like Dish Network

310
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:35,521
gets fined millions for violating it.

311
00:16:35,681 --> 00:16:39,842
The problem is it only applies to one
particular kind of call, sales calls.

312
00:16:40,002 --> 00:16:43,442
And the list doesn't physically
block companies from calling you;

313
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,122
they're just supposed to check it
before doing so,

314
00:16:46,282 --> 00:16:48,042
and scammers generally ignore it.

315
00:16:48,202 --> 00:16:50,042
First, because they're scammers,

316
00:16:50,202 --> 00:16:52,923
and second, 'cause it's now easy
to conceal their identity

317
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,523
with something called "spoofing."

318
00:16:54,683 --> 00:16:56,003
I'll let Senator Susan Collins

319
00:16:56,163 --> 00:16:59,443
show you how it works
in the most awkward possible way.

320
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:03,644
My screen is reading
"Internal Revenue Service."

321
00:17:03,804 --> 00:17:06,204
Well, let's see.

322
00:17:06,364 --> 00:17:08,884
Hello, this is Susan Collins.

323
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:11,404
May I ask who is calling?

324
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:15,044
Hello, Chairman Collins,
this is Sam Dewey from your staff.

325
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:20,005
-Are you calling from the IRS?
-No, Senator, I'm actually over here.

326
00:17:26,725 --> 00:17:28,326
Cool.

327
00:17:28,486 --> 00:17:31,046
Spoofing is actually
the perfect technology

328
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:33,726
for Susan Collins to be demonstrating.
Think about it:

329
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,046
it's all about pretending to be
one thing

330
00:17:36,206 --> 00:17:39,527
and then disappointing everyone
when you reveal who you actually are.

331
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:42,207
But despite sounding like
Urban Dictionary slang

332
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:46,967
for when magicians shoot heroin,
spoofing is undeniably effective.

333
00:17:47,127 --> 00:17:49,967
Robocallers can pretend to be
calling from your area,

334
00:17:50,127 --> 00:17:52,128
increasing the chance
that you will pick up.

335
00:17:52,288 --> 00:17:54,488
And individual scammers can
even pretend to be

336
00:17:54,648 --> 00:17:57,688
someone that you know,
as one reporter found out.

337
00:17:57,848 --> 00:18:00,128
<i>Cybersecurity expert Jim Stickley</i>

338
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:04,769
<i>sets up his phone to call my mom</i>
<i>posing as me.</i>

339
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:06,329
Here we go.

340
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:09,449
<i>- Hi, Jeff.</i>
- Hey, Mom, real quick,

341
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:11,929
I need your social security number
for some forms.

342
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:13,969
-Can you help me out?
<i>-For what?</i>

343
00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:17,810
I got this beneficiary form to fill out.
What's your social security number?

344
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,050
<i>Uh...</i>

345
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,810
Great, thanks a lot, Mom.
Love you.

346
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,810
That was it.
I've got her social security number.

347
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:29,931
Holy shit. Literally everything
about that was upsetting.

348
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:33,371
From the fact that Jeff Rossen
had someone scam his own mother

349
00:18:33,531 --> 00:18:35,291
to the fact that she fell for it

350
00:18:35,451 --> 00:18:39,252
to his amazing reaction when he realizes
his mother did something stupid

351
00:18:39,412 --> 00:18:43,292
to his bold choice to broadcast his own
mother's stupidity on national TV

352
00:18:43,452 --> 00:18:47,092
to the fact that this man told another
man's mother that he loves her

353
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:48,972
to the revelation
that he thinks Rossen

354
00:18:49,132 --> 00:18:51,933
sounds like a middle-aged man
squeezing his own balls

355
00:18:52,093 --> 00:18:55,493
to the fact that Jeff Rossen
could really use a new shirt.

356
00:18:55,653 --> 00:18:59,493
The point is, there's a lot
happening in that clip

357
00:18:59,653 --> 00:19:01,173
and none of it is good.

358
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,734
Also, a quick side note on that:

359
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:07,574
his mother's social security number
wasn't bleeped to protect her identity.

360
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:10,174
It had to be censored because it's:

361
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:14,375
"Fuck shit fuck-cock twat-taint
jizz shit tits."

362
00:19:14,535 --> 00:19:16,775
It wasn't her choice.
It wasn't her choice.

363
00:19:16,935 --> 00:19:19,295
Blame the Social Security
Administration.

364
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:21,375
And thanks to all these new tactics,

365
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:25,735
the onslaught in scam phone calls
is huge, and it's only getting worse.

366
00:19:25,895 --> 00:19:27,936
<i>Next year, some estimates predict</i>

367
00:19:28,096 --> 00:19:32,456
<i>half of all mobile calls</i>
<i>will be scam calls.</i>

368
00:19:32,616 --> 00:19:36,016
Wow. And that is a real problem
for consumers,

369
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,057
because you have to use your phone.

370
00:19:38,217 --> 00:19:42,217
We can't go back to the days where
people shouted their message into a jar

371
00:19:42,377 --> 00:19:44,537
and then mailed it across the country.

372
00:19:44,697 --> 00:19:46,137
That was a terrible system,

373
00:19:46,297 --> 00:19:49,657
as it was only marginally more accurate
than having AT&T now.

374
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:51,938
Oh! You like that, business daddy?

375
00:19:52,098 --> 00:19:55,698
Johnny's acting up again.
Johnny's acting up.

376
00:19:55,858 --> 00:19:58,578
Oh, I bet I'm gonna get
some spicy jars

377
00:19:58,738 --> 00:20:01,378
in the mail about that.
Whoo!

378
00:20:01,538 --> 00:20:05,819
The point is, what can we do about this?
Well, on a personal level,

379
00:20:05,979 --> 00:20:09,139
you can tell companies
you do business with not to call you.

380
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:13,059
By law, they're not allowed
to robocall your cell without consent.

381
00:20:13,219 --> 00:20:15,100
But that is where this gets tricky,

382
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,620
because those user agreements
that you agree to--

383
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,180
you know, the ones that
no one has ever read--

384
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,900
they often give companies
consent to robocall you

385
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,741
and can make revoking it
incredibly difficult.

386
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:30,261
If you're a customer of Credit One Bank
and want them to stop robocalling you,

387
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:34,301
just take out your user agreement
and turn to page four, section 19-C,

388
00:20:34,461 --> 00:20:37,021
where you'll find that you have
to physically mail them

389
00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:39,902
written notice featuring
your name, mailing address,

390
00:20:40,062 --> 00:20:44,022
and the last four digits of your account
number to this P.O. box in Nevada.

391
00:20:44,182 --> 00:20:47,302
And it makes total sense why
you would opt not to do that.

392
00:20:47,462 --> 00:20:50,223
I would rather receive
1,000 phone calls a day

393
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:54,263
every day for the rest of my life
than go out and buy a stamp.

394
00:20:54,423 --> 00:20:57,423
I mean, how the fuck
would I even do that?

395
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,583
Do I have to go to a post office,
or can I go to a Walgreens?

396
00:21:00,743 --> 00:21:04,504
And If I can go to a Walgreens,
is it all the Walgreenses or just some?

397
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:07,624
If it's just some, how do I find out
which ones? Call?

398
00:21:07,784 --> 00:21:10,504
Literally call a place
of business with my telephone

399
00:21:10,664 --> 00:21:13,505
and ask them if they could
sell me a stamp? Then what?

400
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:15,705
I have to physically walk
to the Walgreens?

401
00:21:15,865 --> 00:21:18,865
Literally, physically walk,
like, with my legs?

402
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:21,105
Then wait in line and buy the stamp?

403
00:21:21,265 --> 00:21:22,825
What now?
Put it in a mailbox?

404
00:21:22,985 --> 00:21:25,546
Where the fuck am I gonna find
a mailbox?

405
00:21:25,706 --> 00:21:29,306
The only mailboxes I ever see
are those weird boarded-up green ones.

406
00:21:29,466 --> 00:21:31,386
What the fuck are those things,
by the way?

407
00:21:31,546 --> 00:21:33,466
They're spooky,
that's what they are.

408
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,906
It looks like a memorial
of a past mailbox that died in a war.

409
00:21:37,066 --> 00:21:40,547
So now I have to find the one mailbox
in New York City that hasn't

410
00:21:40,707 --> 00:21:44,627
sacrificed its life for this country,
pry open its big, hungry mail mouth,

411
00:21:44,787 --> 00:21:47,467
and shove a stamped envelope
down its dusty throat?

412
00:21:47,627 --> 00:21:50,908
Not gonna happen! I'd rather die
than engage in that nonsense,

413
00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:53,948
and deep down,
I think you fucking know that.

414
00:21:54,428 --> 00:21:57,348
So it is no wonder
that some people choose to

415
00:21:57,508 --> 00:22:00,188
simply mess with robocallers,
as one journalist did

416
00:22:00,348 --> 00:22:04,029
when he noticed the person on
the other end sounded a bit suspicious.

417
00:23:00,073 --> 00:23:04,034
That man is dead now.
She killed him, she stole his skin,

418
00:23:04,194 --> 00:23:07,114
she walks among us,
and she'll kill again.

419
00:23:07,274 --> 00:23:11,874
But as fun as that is, experts advise
you not to engage with robocalls at all.

420
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:14,675
Don't pick up,
and don't talk if you do answer.

421
00:23:14,835 --> 00:23:17,035
That lets them know
that yours is a live number,

422
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,875
and you'll get robocalled more.

423
00:23:19,035 --> 00:23:20,635
The much bigger point here is,

424
00:23:20,795 --> 00:23:24,275
it should not entirely be up to us
to deal with this bullshit.

425
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,956
The FCC has the authority
to police robocalls.

426
00:23:27,116 --> 00:23:29,796
A few years back,
they put some guardrails in place

427
00:23:29,956 --> 00:23:31,876
with a set of rules
designed to limit them.

428
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:34,276
As the FCC's former Chair
explained at the time,

429
00:23:34,436 --> 00:23:36,997
they basically followed
a simple principle.

430
00:23:37,157 --> 00:23:40,117
The consumer needs to be
the one who's in charge.

431
00:23:40,277 --> 00:23:44,677
The consumer needs to give consent
that they want to be called,

432
00:23:44,837 --> 00:23:47,637
or if they are called
and haven't given consent,

433
00:23:47,797 --> 00:23:50,518
to remove that consent by saying,

434
00:23:50,678 --> 00:23:53,838
"Don't call me anymore,"
or by calling their phone company

435
00:23:53,998 --> 00:23:56,598
and saying, "I don't wanna get
these calls."

436
00:23:56,758 --> 00:23:58,838
And that sounds completely
reasonable,

437
00:23:58,998 --> 00:24:03,119
but unfortunately, those rules were then
struck down after a trade group sued.

438
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,599
At which point, robocalls
increased significantly.

439
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:11,039
So, we made real progress toward
addressing a problem, then we blew it.

440
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,440
We basically got
our one-year sobriety chip

441
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,200
then celebrated by drinking
a gallon of Captain Morgan.

442
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,360
Which is not to say
there aren't things the FCC could do.

443
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,041
Unfortunately, their current Chair
is this guy, Ajit Pai.

444
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:28,121
You've probably seen him on this show
before, alongside his stupid mug.

445
00:24:28,281 --> 00:24:32,481
And by the way...cheers.
Cheers to you.

446
00:24:32,641 --> 00:24:35,321
Now, Pai says a lot
of the right things about this.

447
00:24:35,481 --> 00:24:38,482
He said that robocalls are
"The scourge of civilization."

448
00:24:38,642 --> 00:24:40,282
And he's had a little too much fun

449
00:24:40,442 --> 00:24:43,282
showing how dedicated he is
to tackling this issue.

450
00:24:43,442 --> 00:24:46,082
To borrow from
former President Kennedy:

451
00:24:46,242 --> 00:24:50,323
"Let every robocaller know
whether it wishes us well or ill,

452
00:24:50,483 --> 00:24:53,283
"that we shall pay any price,
bear any burden,

453
00:24:53,443 --> 00:24:56,003
"meet any hardship,
support any solution,

454
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:59,403
and oppose any bot
to assure the survival..."

455
00:24:59,563 --> 00:25:02,404
"...And the peace
of American consumers."

456
00:25:03,684 --> 00:25:06,924
Uh... It sounds like I may have
just won a cruise.

457
00:25:07,084 --> 00:25:09,644
So if you'll excuse me,
I have to take this call.

458
00:25:09,804 --> 00:25:11,925
But thank you very much,
Mr. Chairman.

459
00:25:12,085 --> 00:25:13,485
Oh.

460
00:25:14,685 --> 00:25:17,885
Ladies and gentlemen,
that man is a goober.

461
00:25:18,045 --> 00:25:21,925
And Ajit Pai clearly has aspirations
for higher political office,

462
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:24,046
but I'd argue
that it's not gonna work out.

463
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:27,126
Because Americans can, have,
and will elect bastards,

464
00:25:27,286 --> 00:25:31,246
morons, blowhards,
crooks, perverts, dipshits,

465
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:33,846
con men, scumbags, and shitweasels,

466
00:25:34,006 --> 00:25:38,047
but they will never,
ever elect a goober.

467
00:25:38,207 --> 00:25:41,487
But while he talks a good game,
Pai actually opposed

468
00:25:41,647 --> 00:25:43,247
the rules we mentioned earlier

469
00:25:43,407 --> 00:25:45,567
and was happy
when they were overturned.

470
00:25:45,727 --> 00:25:47,047
And since becoming FCC Chair,

471
00:25:47,207 --> 00:25:49,248
he seemed reluctant
to force telecoms to act.

472
00:25:49,408 --> 00:25:51,728
For instance,
he could require them to offer

473
00:25:51,888 --> 00:25:54,688
free call-blocking services
or implement something called

474
00:25:54,848 --> 00:25:58,128
"call authentication," which could
significantly curtail spoofing,

475
00:25:58,288 --> 00:26:01,809
but he hasn't done that.
Instead, he "urged" them to do it.

476
00:26:01,969 --> 00:26:04,209
and while some say that
they are "working on it,"

477
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:07,729
the fact is, if he had "required" them
to do it from the get-go,

478
00:26:07,889 --> 00:26:09,689
we might have those fixes by now.

479
00:26:09,849 --> 00:26:11,770
Telecom companies
aren't really gonna

480
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,170
listen to you unless
you force them to.

481
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:18,450
And AT&T isn't gonna listen to you
at all unless you call them on T-Mobile.

482
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,330
Ha! How would they hear you otherwise?

483
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:23,531
Their call would drop out.
That's right, business daddy.

484
00:26:23,691 --> 00:26:26,211
That's right.
You've inherited a problem child.

485
00:26:26,371 --> 00:26:29,811
Let's dance.
Let's dance, you and I.

486
00:26:30,611 --> 00:26:34,131
But the thing experts are really worried
that Pai might do

487
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:37,412
is bow to pressure from groups
like telemarketers and banks

488
00:26:37,572 --> 00:26:41,372
and draft a new, narrower definition
of what constitutes "autodialing."

489
00:26:41,532 --> 00:26:45,692
It's technical, but that would basically
limit what would count as a robocall.

490
00:26:45,852 --> 00:26:48,973
And if he does that, it could
have huge consequences.

491
00:26:49,133 --> 00:26:53,093
So, for instance, if Wells Fargo called
your cell phone 6,000 times,

492
00:26:53,253 --> 00:26:56,973
you might no longer be able to sue them
under anti-robocall laws.

493
00:26:57,133 --> 00:26:59,134
And it is safe to assume that
at that point,

494
00:26:59,294 --> 00:27:01,974
robocalls are going to increase
even more.

495
00:27:02,134 --> 00:27:05,734
So if only there was a way to get
the FCC's attention on this issue.

496
00:27:05,894 --> 00:27:08,294
One way to do that
would be if someone had,

497
00:27:08,454 --> 00:27:11,975
I don't know, say the office numbers
of all five FCC Commissioners,

498
00:27:12,135 --> 00:27:15,695
because then you could hypothetically
set up a program to robocall

499
00:27:15,855 --> 00:27:19,015
those numbers every 90 minutes
with a message, say,

500
00:27:19,175 --> 00:27:21,375
I don't know, like this.

501
00:27:46,538 --> 00:27:48,978
That would be really annoying, right?

502
00:27:49,138 --> 00:27:54,298
To get that every 90 minutes,
it would really drive the point home.

503
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:56,658
And, you know, I guess at this point,

504
00:27:56,818 --> 00:27:59,539
it's probably obvious
what is about to happen here.

505
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:03,539
Yes, FCC, we meet again,
old friends.

506
00:28:03,699 --> 00:28:05,739
Except this time,
unlike our past encounters,

507
00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:09,659
I don't need to ask hordes of real
people to bombard you with messages,

508
00:28:09,819 --> 00:28:14,020
because with the miracle of robocalling,
I can now do it all by myself.

509
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:18,540
You see, it turns out
robocalling is so easy,

510
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,021
it only took our tech guy literally
15 minutes to work out how to do it.

511
00:28:23,181 --> 00:28:26,861
So when I press this button, will it
trigger our robocalls to the FCC?

512
00:28:27,021 --> 00:28:28,781
No, no.
That would be too simple.

513
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:31,661
Instead, behold.

514
00:28:32,981 --> 00:28:35,422
Instead...

515
00:28:35,582 --> 00:28:40,662
When my finger presses this button,
I will trigger this much larger finger

516
00:28:40,822 --> 00:28:43,182
that will press
a much larger button,

517
00:28:43,342 --> 00:28:45,822
which will trigger our calls
to the FCC.

518
00:28:45,982 --> 00:28:48,783
So, FCC, you know what
you need to do.

519
00:28:48,943 --> 00:28:51,183
And by the way,
if you want to tell us that

520
00:28:51,343 --> 00:28:54,303
you don't consent to be robocalled,
that's no problem.

521
00:28:54,463 --> 00:28:56,783
Just write a certified letter
to the address

522
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,904
we've buried somewhere within
the first chapter of "Moby Dick"

523
00:29:00,064 --> 00:29:01,904
currently scrolling up the screen.

524
00:29:02,064 --> 00:29:03,744
You got that, right?
You got it.

525
00:29:03,904 --> 00:29:07,504
Find the address, write to us,
and we'll stop the calls immediately.

526
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:12,905
And if you're thinking there should be
a simpler way to opt out, well, no shit.

527
00:29:13,065 --> 00:29:16,185
Okay, there's simply no point
delaying this any longer.

528
00:29:16,345 --> 00:29:17,825
Here goes.

529
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:20,625
Unleash hell.

530
00:29:23,466 --> 00:29:24,986
It's ringing!

531
00:29:25,146 --> 00:29:27,146
I think it's for you.

532
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,386
That's our show.
Thank you so much for watching.

533
00:29:30,546 --> 00:29:32,946
See you next week.
Good night.

534
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:35,747
Pick up.
Pick up.
