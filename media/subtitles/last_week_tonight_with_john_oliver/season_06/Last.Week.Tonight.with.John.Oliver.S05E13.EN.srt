1
00:00:17,176 --> 00:00:20,244
John: Welcome,

2
00:00:20,246 --> 00:00:25,251
welcome, welcome to
"last week tonight!"

3
00:00:25,253 --> 00:00:29,857
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:34,864
Thank you so much
for joining us.

5
00:00:34,866 --> 00:00:39,871
Just time for a quick recap
of the week in which a lot

6
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,174
happened, from narendra modi
beginning his second term as

7
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,810
India's prime ministero the
national spelling bee ending in

8
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:48,514
an 8-way tie -- which is equally
important -- to Robert Mueller

9
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:51,083
holding a press conference to
scream the word "impeachment"

10
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,017
with his eyes.

11
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:55,454
And en -and then there
was Jared kushner,

12
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:58,123
a man who constantly looks like
he was just reset to factory

13
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:58,824
settings.

14
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,794
Jared has been hard at work
on his middle east peace plan,

15
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,396
an undertaking that requires
precision diplomacy and not

16
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,732
doing anything
needlessly inflammatory,

17
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,269
a skill very much not on display
this week when he visited Israel

18
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,838
and met prime minister
Benjamin netanyahu.

19
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:15,174
Kushner psented the prime
minister with a gift,

20
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,842
a gift signed by
President Trump.

21
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:20,512
It was a map of Israel that
includes the Israeli-occupied

22
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:21,346
golan heights.

23
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:22,881
John: Wow.

24
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:26,318
All else aside, a
map is a shitty gift,

25
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,955
and getting it from Jared
kushner is the shittiest way to

26
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:30,622
receive it.

27
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,958
It'd be like if you got a
bouquet of dead fish for your

28
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,327
birthday delivered
by Matt lauer.

29
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,896
No, and also, no.

30
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:38,564
Both no.

31
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:43,135
But much more importantly, that
map is a huge symbolic gesture.

32
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,971
The golan heights is an area
that virtually the entire

33
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:49,508
international community
considers occupied Syrian rrity,

34
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,644
so it's a willfully provocative
move with a finishing touch that

35
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:53,979
is pure Trump.

36
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,183
The word there, top
right, just circled there,

37
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:02,921
"nice." John: Holy shit.

38
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:05,390
I guess the only really
surprising thing there is that

39
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:10,362
Trump clearly spelled "noice"
wrong, because it's n-o-i-c-e.

40
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,664
Any of this year's eight
spelling bee co-champions could

41
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:13,332
ha tolyou that.

42
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,900
Well, three of them
could -- you know,

43
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,401
the three who actually
deserved to win.

44
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,003
They know who they are.

45
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,906
But for now, let's
move on to Tennessee,

46
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:24,042
rated one of the 49 best states
in the country by "obvious

47
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,612
references to Florida" magazine.

48
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,014
Tennessee's state legislature
has been embroiled in a major

49
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,049
scandal for the past month, and
while it may not be the most

50
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,386
important thing in the world,
every details spectacular.

51
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:37,322
It involves republican speaker
of the house Glen casada,

52
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,992
a family values conservative,
and his chief of staff,

53
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,495
Cade cothren, who, it's emerged,
has a history of sending some

54
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,797
pretty racist text messages.

55
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:48,967
In an exchange with casada,
cothren appears to refer to a

56
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:52,371
west Tennessee district
with this black people meme.

57
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,940
In a text with other
friends, cothren says,

58
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:58,911
"black people are idiots,"
and insists that tampa bay

59
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:03,682
quarterback jameis Winston be
called a "thug n-word." You

60
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,617
referred to jameis
Winston as a thug [bleep].

61
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:08,153
How can you justify that?

62
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:11,323
John: Okay, so it's not super
surprising that a Tennessee

63
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,992
republican and his top aide
are being flagrantly racist,

64
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,461
especially when one of them
is called Cade -- y'know,

65
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:19,965
the name you get when the
name "cha fucks a gatorade.

66
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:24,503
But also, for the record, that
reporter doesn't get to say the

67
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,437
n-word either.

68
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:29,474
Inact, there's only one old
white man who is allowed to say

69
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,809
the n-word, and it's this guy.

70
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,311
His name is Cole Swanson.

71
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,912
He lives in a sleepy
little Maine town.

72
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,315
He's a former Navy man and a
retired schoolteacher who never

73
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,216
remarried after his
beloved wife, Celia,

74
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:40,819
passed away after 55
blissful years of marriage.

75
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,388
These days, around evening time,
you can find Cole down by the

76
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,056
docks.

77
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,124
He likes watching the fishing
boats come in at sunset,

78
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,161
says there's a quiet
and noble poetry to it.

79
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,297
Anyway, in 2007, it was
unanimously decided that Cole is

80
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,666
the only ite y who's allowed
to say the full n-word.

81
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,336
But, friends, he never does.

82
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,004
And that's why he was chosen.

83
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:04,977
Anyway -- anyway, speaker of the
house casada initially defended

84
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,779
his chief of staff, suggesting
he'd been framed by liberals.

85
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,283
And yet, if you can believe
it, which you definitely can,

86
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,652
that defense quickly fell apart.

87
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:17,055
The text messages also included
this selfie that cothren had

88
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:18,690
taken at 2:15 A.M.

89
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,492
During a trip to Colorado.

90
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:23,762
He texted "tripping balls
out of my mind" at 2:15.

91
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:27,232
"Craziest experience
of my entire life.

92
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:31,570
Acid, cocaine, weed." After
a 2015 trip to the Dominican

93
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:35,807
Republic, cothren also texted,
"just did a gram of cocaine in

94
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,977
my office." It was
sent at 10:38 A.M.

95
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,278
on a workday.

96
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,581
John: Okay, okay, okay.

97
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,984
The emphasis on what time of day
these events occurred is a bit

98
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:49,121
weird there in that it seems to
suggest the main issue here was

99
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,055
scheduling.

100
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:53,625
Would noon have been a more
appropriate time to blow a g of

101
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,294
yayo off taxpayer-funded
office furniture?

102
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:58,363
If chrenad waited until
the dead of night,

103
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,098
snuck back into his
empty office building,

104
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,601
and then took a ski trip
to mount booger sugar,

105
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,136
that would have been
better, would it?

106
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,971
I don't think so.

107
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,341
But cothren's behavior clearly
reflects badly on his boss, who,

108
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,344
incidentally, lobbied to have
welfare benefits stried fm

109
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,112
people who test
positive for drugs.

110
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:17,315
As for cothren himself, he has
since issued what amounts to an

111
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:20,452
excuse-planation for those
text messages, saying,

112
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,320
"while I'm not proud of
who I was in the past,

113
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:25,190
I am proud that I've been able
to achieve so much in the years

114
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,693
since." And that may seem
implausible to you -- these

115
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:31,029
texts were sent just three
years ago -- but in fairness,

116
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,066
you n gea lot of personal growth
done when you're taking cocaine

117
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,634
at 10:30 in the morning.

118
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:38,970
And while cothren
wound up resigning,

119
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:42,474
it was clear that speaker casada
was absolutely culpable here

120
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,744
too, because they seemed on
the same page to a legitimately

121
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,779
disturbing extent.

122
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,249
The latest revelation comes amid
the ongoing text message scandal

123
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,853
involving casada and cothren,
part of which involved an August

124
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,189
2016 incident here
at party fowl,

125
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,792
a restaurant and bar right
on the edge of downtown.

126
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:04,563
In one exchange, cothren texted
casada boasting about having sex

127
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:07,132
with a woman in the
bathroom at party fowl.

128
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,133
"I knew it!"

129
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:11,837
Casada responded, asking,
"r u a minute man?"

130
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,473
"Like father, like
son," said the aide.

131
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,809
The response, "if I'm
happy, then all is good!"

132
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,979
Four days later, cas-pac
reported campaign funds paid out

133
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,716
to party fowl for $180.59.

134
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,384
John: Oh, my god!

135
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:30,689
I mean, setting aside the
questionable use of campaign

136
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,525
funds, there is no way that
cothran had sex in that

137
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:34,192
bathroom.

138
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,027
But if anything, that
actually makes it worse,

139
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:39,364
because the only thing on earth
more shatteringly distasteful

140
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:42,434
than attempting to impress a
state rep by bragging about

141
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,270
being a sexl disappointment
in the bathroom at a Tennessee

142
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:49,374
chicken restaurant that serves a
55-ounce bloody Mary topped with

143
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,844
two whole fried cornish
game eight fried okra,

144
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:58,183
and a whole avocado is
attempting to impress a state

145
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:01,586
rep by lying in a toilet text
about all the lightning-fast

146
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,222
orgasming you're doin in the
bathroom at said Tennessee

147
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,791
chicken restaurant.

148
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,627
Unfortunately, there's no way
to know what Cade cothren was

149
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,328
really doing in the
bathroom at party fowl.

150
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,030
The only thing we know
for absolute sure is,

151
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:15,133
whatever he was doing, he didn't
wash his hands after doing it,

152
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,269
because according
to one yelp review,

153
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:22,174
"the bhroolacked toilet paper
and soap." And look, look, look,

154
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,476
that review was from 2015.

155
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,045
But if you are tempted to give
them the benefit of the doubt --

156
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:30,048
tempted to say, "maybe party
fowl isn't proud of who it was

157
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:30,882
in the past.

158
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,885
Maybe it's been able to achieve
so much in the years since,

159
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:34,553
" don't be.

160
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,989
Because three years later,
"there was no soap and no toilet

161
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:43,028
paper in the restrooms." Also,
it seems crucial that you know

162
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,998
the floor of that restroom was
"so slippery it was like walking

163
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,334
on ice." Which does make sense.

164
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,770
That floor is probably
filthy with chicken grease,

165
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,406
Cade cothren's rapidly
expelled ejaculate,

166
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,175
and/or the flop sweat he
developed from trying to seem

167
00:07:57,176 --> 00:08:00,478
like Mr. Cool x inront of
Tennessee state rep Glen casada.

168
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,982
Now, clearly, this
story is incredible,

169
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,152
but you should know casada's
announced that he'll meet with

170
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,855
republican leadership tomorrow
to determine a date on which

171
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:10,522
he'll resign.

172
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:13,425
Not that he has ch cice there,
having been abandoned by his

173
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:16,494
party, which overwhelmingly
passed a no-confidence vote in

174
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:17,162
him.

175
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,231
And while that should
not be surprising,

176
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:23,435
it's worth noting just how
unusual that now actually is.

177
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,404
In fact, given the heinous
conduct that the republican

178
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,907
party has now
completely normalized,

179
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:31,209
the sight of them actually
holding one of their own to

180
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:37,015
account is -- to rrow misused
phrase -- "nice." And now this.

181
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,485
Announcer: And now,
animal planet's "Dr.

182
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:44,623
Dee: Alaska vet"
is on a mission.

183
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:45,590
I don't want to be pushy.

184
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,727
It's my first time in town, and
I don't want them to tnk that's

185
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,296
all I'm here for is to
castrate everything in sight.

186
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,697
Are you my first patient?

187
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,899
Can you sit?

188
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,667
Do you want to have
your balls cut off?

189
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:56,968
We don't want to hurt him.

190
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:57,936
We just want to castrate him.

191
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:58,603
One.

192
00:08:58,604 --> 00:08:59,271
Two.

193
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:03,775
Tiffany, we are going to
go cut some nuts off today.

194
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:04,442
Is that okay?

195
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:08,513
The's a lot of dogs and
testicles in this village.

196
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:09,814
Typical blonde Belgian.

197
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,784
I'm a typical blonde
veterinarian who cuts blonde

198
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,152
Belgian balls off.

199
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,855
Tip the little calf over.

200
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,523
Find the testicles,
take them off,

201
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:19,891
and you go home and
you have dinner.

202
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,127
He can be as testy as he
wants, because pretty soon,

203
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,663
I'm because pretty soon, I'm
going to have his testes in my

204
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:25,330
hands.

205
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,665
It seems like every
time I go to Tony's,

206
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,332
something loses its testicles.

207
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,001
I don't know what to say
except she enjoys her work.

208
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,136
John: Moving on.

209
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:38,109
For oumain story tonight, we're
going to talk about medicine,

210
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,045
the thing that doogie howser
pretended to be able to

211
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,747
practice, leading to 92
deaths and life in prison.

212
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,616
Yeah, that's how the show ended.

213
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,651
You didn't watch long enough.

214
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:49,054
Specifically, we're going to
talk about medical devices,

215
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,457
the modern-day miracles that
range from contact lenses to

216
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,093
pacemakers that keep hearts
beating to hip replacements that

217
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,596
can transform lives, as this
woman will tell you in a solemn

218
00:09:58,597 --> 00:09:59,264
testimonial.

219
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,300
I wasery frhtened to
do a hip replacement.

220
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:05,303
I really didn't want to
do a hip replacement.

221
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,939
And she got the hip replacement,
and she's better than new.

222
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,942
It's just fascinating
to see her.

223
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,579
She's dancing as if she never
got a hip replacement, you know?

224
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,182
John: Admit it, you didn't
see that story ending with a

225
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,417
breakdancing group of
50-year-olds called -- and this

226
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:23,888
is true -- "momz in da hood."
And you're going to be even more

227
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,157
surprised when I tell you
they're actually here tonight.

228
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:29,260
♪ ♪ Please welcome
momz in da hood!

229
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,196
♪ ♪ They're not here.

230
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,364
They're not here.

231
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,531
They're not here.

232
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,467
Of course they're not here!

233
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,738
You think they're coming to a
post- "game of thrones" hbo?

234
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,673
They're momz in da hood!

235
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,009
They have better places to be!

236
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,512
It would be a waste of
their valuable time.

237
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,582
The medical device
industry is huge.

238
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:55,053
They constitute a $156-billion
market in the U.S., and more

239
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,554
people have one
than you'd think.

240
00:10:56,555 --> 00:11:00,859
About 32 million Americans --
that's 1 in 10-have at least one

241
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,228
medical device implanted
in their bodies.

242
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:06,097
That's right, all these years
we've been waiting anxiously for

243
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:09,401
the robot apocalypse, and it
turns out the robot apocalypse

244
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,902
was insi us the whole time.

245
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:15,874
And while medical devices can
undeniably do tremendous good

246
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,743
and save lives, they can
also cause real problems.

247
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,645
And you're probably
aware of some of them,

248
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,981
thanks to personal injury
lawyer ads like these.

249
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:26,184
Have you or loved one had
complications after a knee

250
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,253
replacement or revision surgery?

251
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,522
Have you or a loved one
had hernia mesh implanted

252
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,090
specifically for hernia repair?

253
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:35,160
Have you or a loved one had an
ivc filter implanted to prevent

254
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,528
blood clots from
reaching the lungs?

255
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,797
Have you or a loved one
developed a drug-resistant

256
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,332
bacterial infection or a
superbug after undergoing an

257
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,002
ercp procedure using
a duodenoscope?

258
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:48,073
John: Yes, actually, yes, I do
have a loved one who's developed

259
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,408
a drug-resistant bacterial
infection or superbug after

260
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,745
undergoing an ercp procedure
using a duodenoscope.

261
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:58,049
And may I say, I thank god the
card categories at hallmark have

262
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,651
gotten so specific.

263
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:00,885
I had options on that one.

264
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:05,023
Now, while it's easy to roll
your eyes at ads like those,

265
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,692
the problems that they
are citing are very real.

266
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:11,329
Medical devices can malfunction,
sometimes in horrifying fashion.

267
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,499
Just imagine a defective
defibrillator painfully shocking

268
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,735
you multiple times or a
malfunctioning Insulin pump

269
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,803
giving you the wrong dose.

270
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:21,106
Well, both of those
things have happened.

271
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,775
In fact, a massive recent
investigation found more than

272
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:29,180
80,000 deaths and 1.7 million
injuries possibly linked to

273
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:32,383
medical devices were reported
to e fdin the past decade.

274
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,686
And while you'd naturally
assume that medical devices are

275
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,155
extensively tested before
they're put on the market,

276
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,257
that is not
necessarily the case.

277
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,761
Even devices that go inside you
may never have been subjected to

278
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:44,496
a clinical trial.

279
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:48,233
And don't feel bad if you're
suddenly surprised by that.

280
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,935
One researcher found many
doctors aren't aware of this

281
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,170
either.

282
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:55,640
We were surprised to see how
little surgeons knew in our

283
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:59,410
study about the approval
process for devices,

284
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:02,113
that some of the surgeons
seemed to think that, well,

285
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,648
the fda had taken care of this.

286
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,151
That of course these devices
had been tested in humans.

287
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,988
John: That's terrifying that
even your doctor may not know

288
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,190
that you're essentially being
treated like a Guinea pig.

289
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,326
And nobody wants to be treated
like a Guinea pig unless it

290
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:18,029
means you get your o hanng water
bottle that you can suck on from

291
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,065
your bed, which actually sounds
completely delightful to me.

292
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:25,470
So tonight, let's talk about how
medical devices get approved.

293
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,072
And before we start, the nature
of this story means there are

294
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,441
two clips you'll see
that are a little gross.

295
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:33,444
So before each one, I'm going
to say a safe word, "opossum,

296
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,814
" and flash it on screen with a
sound effect like this: [Siren

297
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,751
wails] Basically, when you
see that, if you're squeamish,

298
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,419
you'll know to look away.

299
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,756
And now that you have been
fairly warned, let's begin.

300
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:48,026
For many years, medical devices
were hardly regulated at all.

301
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,695
Instead, the fda produced
sternly worded public

302
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:54,199
information messages like
this: Today's doctors, drugs,

303
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,969
and medical devices truly work
medical miracles for young and

304
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,472
old alike, but there are
some as phony as a $3 bill.

305
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:05,276
Like this zeta
applicator, for example,

306
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:08,780
which has claimed to cure
arthritis with "z-rays." There

307
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,248
are no z-rays.

308
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,650
John: He was right, of course.

309
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:15,053
Z-rays wouldn't be
discovered until 2011,

310
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,789
when they were identified as
the powerful sexual radiation

311
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,290
emanating from zayn Malik.

312
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,158
Feel the zs.

313
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,595
Feel the zs right now
burrow into your soul.

314
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:28,032
But in the 1970s, congress
passed a law giving the fda the

315
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,068
authority to approve
medical devices,

316
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,570
and you might assume that,
on the basis of that,

317
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:35,740
every single device
is fda approved.

318
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:38,643
But in fact, far more of them
are instead something called

319
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:42,447
"fda cleared," and that is
a distinction with a big

320
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:46,784
difference, because fda cleared
is a much lor bar to clear.

321
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:49,587
You've probably seen the phrase
"fda cleared" on products like

322
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:53,324
this anti-aging laser treatment,
but it can mean very little.

323
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,760
Even the sharks on
"shark tank" know this.

324
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,495
Watch their response when
someone pitched them an

325
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:01,432
acupressure band and tried to
pull the whole fda-cleared card.

326
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:05,069
Hey, romy, is there any proof
that this actually works?

327
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,505
It's an fda-cleared
medic device.

328
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:08,840
That's not an answer
to the question.

329
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:09,507
No, that's not what I'm asking.

330
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:10,608
John: Yeah, cubes is right.

331
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,043
When is he not?

332
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,878
My man cubes nailed it there.

333
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:18,716
Because saying something's fda
clead is in no way proof that a

334
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,184
device actually works.

335
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,954
It's a phrase that can promise
way more than it delivers.

336
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,823
Like when a cereal describes
itself as "part of a complete

337
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,293
breakfast." That doesn't
really mean anything.

338
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,029
Anything can technically be
part of a complete breakfast.

339
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,665
If you ingest it alongside
oatmeal, yogurt, granola,

340
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,566
fruit salad, and a
glass of orange juice,

341
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:41,005
eakfast.s part of a complete
and the way most products get

342
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:44,542
cleared is through a loophole
in the system called the 510(K)

343
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:45,209
Pathway.

344
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,679
It wasn't actually a bad idea
when they initially came up with

345
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,346
it.

346
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:51,182
Basically, the fda wouldn't make
companies go through a strenuous

347
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:55,553
testing process if their device
was substantially similar to one

348
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:56,521
that hadome fore.

349
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,323
That way, they wouldn't
stifle innovation.

350
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,958
But it was only supposed
to apply narrowly.

351
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,330
The problem is, nowadays more
than 80% of medical devices are

352
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:10,335
clearethroh the 510(K) Loophole,
including around 400 implanted

353
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,770
medical devices every year
-- those are the ones that go

354
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,639
inside your body.

355
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,442
And that whole idea of being
"substantially equivalent" to

356
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,011
devices that came before has
some real problems with it

357
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,580
because it can essentially
become a high-stakes game of

358
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,016
"telephone." Let me
show you: In 2008,

359
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,952
a company called depuy received
fda clearance for a hip

360
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:31,589
replacement based on its
substantial equivalence to six

361
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,392
previous devices, all of which
were cleared because of their

362
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:37,995
similarity to devices before
that and devices before that and

363
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:40,431
before that, all the way back to
hips that were on the market in

364
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,066
1975.

365
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:45,803
Now, incredibly, some of those
devices had since been taken off

366
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,506
the market by their
manufacturers because of their

367
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,474
high failure rates.

368
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:53,745
But under fda rules, depuy could
still use them as a basis for

369
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,179
getting their hips cleared.

370
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,683
And the thing is, depuy's hip
really would have benefited from

371
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,084
clinical testing
in human beings,

372
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,486
because therwas big problem.

373
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,888
While it may've looked
similar to its predecessors,

374
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:07,058
it was crucially different in
that both its ball and socket

375
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:10,061
were made out of metal, and it
turns out that when metal rubs

376
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,697
against metal, bad
things can happen,

377
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,299
which sounds like the tagline
for a movie about a masturbating

378
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,300
robot.

379
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:20,505
You'll -- you'll notice that we
didn't actually come up with a

380
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,741
funny fake name for that movie
because the perfect name for a

381
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:26,110
movie about a masturbating
robot already exists,

382
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:32,450
and it's "chappie." But those
metal-on-metal hips began to

383
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:36,187
degrade with wear-and-tear,
and the consequences wergrim

384
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:40,258
orthopedic surgeon Dr. Herbert
huddleston of tarzana testified

385
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:45,062
at trial he's taken out dozens
of metal-on-metal hips th fled.

386
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:46,230
In the worst cases...

387
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,766
The bone and the soft tissues
around the hip started to look

388
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:52,069
like pieces of cheese, except
pitch-black pieces of cheese.

389
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:55,673
Sometimes we get in there and it
looks like it's filled with old

390
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,108
oil that you've
drained from your car.

391
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:57,775
John: Opossum!

392
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:58,643
Opossum!

393
00:17:58,644 --> 00:17:59,410
[Siren wails] Shit!

394
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,077
Shit!

395
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:01,679
I meant to say it
before the clip.

396
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,247
Soy, tt was an opossum.

397
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:03,981
That was one of them.

398
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,516
I won't miss the next one.

399
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:06,184
That's on me.

400
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:11,422
Anyway, depuy's parent company
has since spent more than $3

401
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,992
billion to settle thousands of
lawsuits over their metal hip

402
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:15,693
implants.

403
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,763
And you feel that this could've
been avoided if an outside agcy

404
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,365
had just had a closer eye
on what depuy was doing,

405
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,568
because the company
-- being, you know,

406
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:27,238
a company -- was excitedly
trying to put as many of its

407
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,739
hips in people as possible.

408
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,210
Just watch depuy's sales force
celebrate the early success of

409
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,678
its metal hips.

410
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,948
"Taking shares of business"
was the theme of a depuy sales

411
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,350
conference in 2008.

412
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:44,622
This video, shown to the jury,
stars depuy's then-top marketing

413
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,959
guru alongside
costumed alligators,

414
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,129
a bloody man with a hatchet,
and a giant metal hip implant.

415
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,233
John: Now, you probably have
a lot of questions there,

416
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,601
and if you're like
me, the first one is,

417
00:18:56,602 --> 00:19:00,605
"why include an axe murderer
in your parade about medical

418
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:01,806
implants?"

419
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,509
I can only assume it's a rdi
as-themed reference to the

420
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,912
axeman of New Orleans, a mostly
forgotten serial killer who

421
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,181
stalked the streets of
the big easy in 1918,

422
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,984
apparently threatening anyone --
and this is true -- who wasn't

423
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,085
joyi jazz enough.

424
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:17,889
And that is an admirably deep
cut, although if I'm honest,

425
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:22,059
I would have preferred them
to have put at least as much

426
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,897
research into metal poisoning as
they did into early 20th century

427
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:26,931
jazz-loving serial killers.

428
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:30,902
And 's n just the sales force
who were amped about the success

429
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:31,869
of depuy's hips.

430
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,538
One of the people
who helped design it,

431
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,807
Dr. Thomas schmalzried, was
excited too -- although not

432
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:39,677
entirely for the reasons you'd
hope a doctor would be excited

433
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,413
about a new medical device,
because he even made an

434
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:46,417
appearance to pump up depuy's
sales force at that meeting with

435
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:49,420
his special schmalzreid charm.

436
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:52,991
Did you know that the first
billion is the hardest?

437
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:59,397
Billion here, billion there,
pretty soon it adds up to some

438
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,400
real money.

439
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:06,771
Anyone here wanna go for two?

440
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,105
[Audience cheers] I'm
gonna say that again.

441
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:11,609
Does anyone here
wanna go for two?

442
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,611
[Audience cheers] John:
Now, I know that sounds bad,

443
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,013
but I'm sure if some of the
patients who had used his

444
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,349
product were there, they too
would have stood and cheered.

445
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,885
And then, you know, collapsed
in a heap because their hips are

446
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,453
now pitch-black cheese.

447
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:25,723
And if you're wondering why
a doctor should be so excited

448
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,961
about sales, depuy paid him $20
million in royalties for his

449
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,662
role in helping to
design their sale.

450
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:36,100
Including a cut of every and if
I may paraphrase a deeply smarmy

451
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:41,272
man, 20 billion here, 20 billion
ther pretty soon it adds up to

452
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,173
some real money.

453
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,176
Mmm.

454
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:48,646
But I'll say this for
metal-on-metal hips,

455
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,681
at least they can be removed.

456
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,483
It's not easy, and it's
sometimes dangerous,

457
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:53,884
but it can be done.

458
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:57,588
It's much harder to do that with
certain types of surgical mesh,

459
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,224
another fda-cleared device.

460
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:03,327
Very basically, mesh is
implanted in the tissue,

461
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:06,130
which then heals around
it, sealing it in,

462
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:09,200
which can make it risky to take
out without damaging surrounding

463
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,034
tissue and organs.

464
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:13,804
Meshes were initially cleared
by the fda for hernias,

465
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:16,507
but a few years backthey were
also cleared for use on vaginal

466
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:20,344
tissue, in many cases without
having had to undergo any

467
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:21,746
clinical trials.

468
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,414
And things did not go well.

469
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:28,052
And ahead of the next clip,
I am going to say opossum.

470
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,221
[Sir wails] Not because you're
about to see anything gross,

471
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,623
but because of what
you're about to hear.

472
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,926
It felt like a cheese
grater inside of me.

473
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:40,531
It felt like the material
was pulling on the muscles,

474
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,067
and I'd get shooting pains.

475
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:47,405
You almost felt like there was
something inside of you that was

476
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:50,941
like sandpaper, back and
forth, every time you'd walk.

477
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:51,609
John: That is viouy horrifying.

478
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,943
There is absolutely no
circumstance in which you should

479
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,278
feel like there is sandpaper in
your groin, apart, of course,

480
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,613
from when a cat is
going down on you.

481
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,313
That's the only time.

482
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:59,350
That's the only time.

483
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:04,356
And even then, even then there
are real problems involved.

484
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:07,992
Even then.

485
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,026
Take it down.

486
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:10,361
Take it down.

487
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:15,499
The good news -- the good news
is that the fda recently ordered

488
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,569
vaginal mesh manufacturers to
stop selling their product.

489
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,305
And as for metal-on-metal
hips, going forward,

490
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:22,973
they won't be fda cleared.

491
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,376
Instead, they'll have to go
through the much more rigorous

492
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:28,112
process that gets
you fda approved.

493
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:31,315
It requires that a high-risk
device be tested on humans,

494
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:35,252
which is great, but even
the approval system has its

495
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:35,920
problems.

496
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,589
For one thing, the fda relies
on manufacturers to do their own

497
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,525
clinical testing, and those
tests can be very limited.

498
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,829
And for just one example of the
approval system's shortcomings,

499
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,399
look at essure, metal coils that
were marketed as permanently

500
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,534
implanted birth control
devices for women.

501
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,170
Essure's manufacturer, in its
application for fda approval,

502
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:57,708
claimed that "99% of women
clical studies rated their

503
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,845
comfort with the device
as 'good to excellent,

504
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,146
'" and the fda approved it.

505
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:05,950
And yet, 15 years later, the
fda had received over 32,

506
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:09,253
000 reports of problems
with essure, including pain,

507
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,555
dislocation of the device,
genital hemorrhage,

508
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,992
and perforated organs, none of
which really sound particularly

509
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,961
"good" or "excellent" to me.

510
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:20,865
And if you're having trouble
squaring that with the sky-high

511
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,367
satisfaction rate in
essure's clinical studies,

512
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,970
some of the participants in it
say there may be a reason for

513
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,071
that.

514
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,774
The first time I saw the
question "rate your comfort of

515
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:33,577
wearing the device," I
said, "what does this mean?"

516
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,045
I'm not wearing anything.

517
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,448
This is something that's
implanted inside of my body.

518
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,651
The nurse said,
"can you feel it?"

519
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:43,287
And I said, "I can feel
pain in my abdomen.

520
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:48,192
Where that pain is coming from,
I don't know." And she said,

521
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:51,262
"then you need to rate it as
excellent." They would say,

522
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,430
"are you happy
with the product?"

523
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,800
I would say, "no."
And they would say,

524
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,001
"but you're not pregnant?"

525
00:23:57,002 --> 00:24:01,639
I would say, "correct." "Well,
then it's doing its job.

526
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,908
So you have to be happy
with that." John: Okay,

527
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:07,511
but just because something is
technically fulfilling its job

528
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:11,549
does not mean you have
to be happy with it.

529
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,518
Pennywise technically fulfills
all the requirements of a

530
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:17,054
birthday clown, but when you
book him for your kid's fifth

531
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,190
birthday party a
it esn't go well,

532
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:22,459
you should not be obliged
to rate him as excellent.

533
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,695
So I guess the big
question here is,

534
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:27,865
how can you know if a device
is potentially harmful?

535
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,534
And unfortunately, good
information is actually very

536
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:31,435
difficult to find.

537
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:36,040
For a start, one estimate
suggested less than half of 1%

538
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:40,077
of medical device failures are
even reported to the fda, which,

539
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,112
when you think about it,
is genuinely remarkable.

540
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:45,716
100% of rude waiters
are reported to yelp,

541
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,985
and those aren't
killing anybody.

542
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,055
In fact, public reporting of
issues with devices is so bad,

543
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,757
many patients have been forced
to learn about problems in

544
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:57,494
less-than-ideal ways, like from
that alarmingly alert woman in a

545
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:00,631
law firm commercial or
often even Facebook.

546
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,868
A couple of months ago, the fda
heldearings to alert women to

547
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,003
potential issues
with breast implants.

548
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,473
But for years and years
and year before that,

549
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:13,744
women were finding out simply
by warningne another online.

550
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:16,046
The private group is called
"breast implant illness and

551
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:20,651
healing by Nicole," and today
it has more than 79,000 members.

552
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:23,120
I was like, "this is
unbelievable that this can

553
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:26,624
happen to so many people." Page
after page, that's my story,

554
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,491
that's my story.

555
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:28,759
Everyone has the same symptoms.

556
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,329
John: Yeah, they found out
through Facebook groups,

557
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,232
traditionally the least
reliable source of information,

558
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:38,502
right below
horoscopes, "infowars,

559
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:41,338
" and a mole person screaming
in the subway tunnels.

560
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:44,074
Look, this system
clearly needs reform.

561
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,409
And don't just
take that from me.

562
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,545
Eight years ago, t instute of
medicine actually called for an

563
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:50,514
end to the 510(K)
Loophole -- you know,

564
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:53,183
the one that hips and mesh went
through -- saying it should be

565
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:56,186
replaced by a regulatory
framework based on sound

566
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:56,921
science.

567
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:59,723
And that framework does not need
to be so strict that innovation

568
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:03,193
is stifled, just not so lax
that people are getng needlessly

569
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:03,861
hurt.

570
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:07,264
At the very least, you would
hope that implanted devices

571
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:10,868
would undergo clinical testing
before being put inside you.

572
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:13,804
But any time that meaningful
reforms have been suggested,

573
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,840
device manufacturers have
lobbied hard and helped defeat

574
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:17,508
them.

575
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,109
Because of course they have.

576
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,345
Any changes would mean
they'd have to work hard,

577
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,580
and nobody wants to work harder.

578
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:26,984
You think we like doing these
heavily researched stories?

579
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,553
You think this was fun for us?

580
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,155
Hbo makes us do this!

581
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:34,325
If it was up to us, we'd work
one day a week and every segment

582
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:36,894
would be two minutes long and
have a title like "pillows and

583
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:42,132
how they are soft, bye-bye."
But, look -- that would be fun.

584
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:46,870
But until our current system
is improved, unfortunately,

585
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:49,239
patients have to be
their own advocates,

586
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,776
and experts advise researching
any implanted device and asking

587
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,212
questions like, "is
there an alternative?"

588
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,214
"Can the device be removed
if something goes wro?"

589
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:59,683
And "how long has the
device been on the market?"

590
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:03,120
Because just because something
is new doesn't necessarily mean

591
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,823
it's better or even
that it's been tested.

592
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:09,026
The point here is, our medical
device system needs serious

593
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:09,693
attention.

594
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:12,296
And until it is fixed, it would
be nice if people were alerted

595
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,466
to the flaws with our process
with the same urgency with which

596
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,402
they're alerted to the
flaws with our devices.

597
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:19,470
Attention.

598
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,739
If you or a loved one are
thinking about getting an

599
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,576
implanted medical device, you
may want to listen the fuck up,

600
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,345
because it turns out the fda
is so far up medical device

601
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:31,081
manufacturers' asses you can
only locate them with this

602
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:32,483
duodenoscope.

603
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,752
And thanks to that,
manufacturers are getting rich,

604
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:37,388
doctors are getting rich, and
patients are getting their

605
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,390
insides turned into
oil and cheese.

606
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:40,057
Sorry.

607
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:40,724
Opossum.

608
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:44,595
[S wails] You and your loved
ones need to know it can take

609
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,997
years before the public finds
out about problems with a new

610
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,967
device, and in the meantime,
your best source of information

611
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:53,203
may be fucking Facebook, and the
only thing you should ever learn

612
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:56,607
from Facebook is which of your
friends has the ugliest baby.

613
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:57,374
It's Greg's.

614
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:02,746
So act now to protect
yourself fore it's too late.

615
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:05,182
Basically treat medical devices
like guys who have played

616
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:05,849
Batman.

617
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,053
Some are great, but new ones
aren't necessarily better,

618
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:11,722
and there are a few you
definitely don't want to let

619
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:12,956
inside your body.

620
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,592
And if hearing about
duodenoscopes and sandpaper

621
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,428
vaginas have made
you uncomfortable,

622
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,296
as long as it hasn't
made you pregnant,

623
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:22,000
I'm afraid you have to rate
your experience as excellent.

624
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,673
[Bell dings] John:
That's our show.

625
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:32,910
Thanks so much for watching.

626
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,512
See you next week.

627
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:36,814
Good night!

628
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,817
[Cheers and applause]
