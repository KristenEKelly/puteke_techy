welcome to "last week tonight."

00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,700
I'm John Oliver, thank you so

8
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:36,166
much for joining us.

9
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:37,233
Just time for a quick recap of

10
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:39,200
the week, and it was a busy one

11
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:40,400
for the president, who, in

12
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:41,800
between claiming his father was

13
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:43,900
born in Germany when he was born

14
00:00:43,967 --> 00:00:46,467
in New York, mispronouncing the

15
00:00:46,533 --> 00:00:47,900
word "origins" as "oranges"

16
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:49,400
repeatedly, and trolling

17
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:51,000
Joe biden for touching women...

18
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:54,233
which seems, y'know, a bit

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,533
fucking rich... made a major and

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,233
shocking decision on Thursday

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,834
regarding the federal reserve.

22
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,233
President trump is said to of

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:00,934
selected Herman Cain for the

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,367
federal reserve board.

25
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:04,800
A former pizza executive

26
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:07,200
turned radio talk show host who

27
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:08,633
dropped his 2012 republican

28
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,200
presidential bid amid sexual

29
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:11,333
harassment allegations, not a

30
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,834
typical resume for a federal

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,700
reserve board member.

32
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:16,800
John: Oh, really?

33
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:17,700
You sure about that?

34
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:18,367
You think the resume of

35
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:19,266
pizza maker, talk show host, and

36
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,400
alleged sexual harasser would be

37
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:21,900
pretty unusual for the fed?

38
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:23,233
Well, why don't you tell that to

39
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,133
the rest of the board, six

40
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,433
Mario batalis?

41
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,300
But it is true, picking

42
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:29,066
Herman Cain for the federal

43
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:30,266
reserve is bonkers, and comes

44
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,700
just two weeks after trump also

45
00:01:32,767 --> 00:01:34,100
said he'll nominate

46
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:34,934
Stephen Moore, a TV commentator

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and fellow at a conservative

48
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:39,567
think tank.

49
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:40,834
And these two likely nominees

50
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,600
are causing more concern than

51
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:43,533
your typical trump

52
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,033
administration appointee, and

53
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,433
for good reason, as I'll let a

54
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,500
former deputy secretary of the

55
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:49,166
treasury explain.

56
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:50,166
It's one thing to be putting,

57
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:50,800
you know, your political friends

58
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:51,400
and cronies, you know, within

59
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:52,567
the agencies, but to put them on

60
00:01:52,633 --> 00:01:53,900
the board of the central bank is

61
00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:56,066
something that is... that has to

62
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:58,200
be done very, very cautiously,

63
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:00,967
because the moment the fed loses

64
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:02,467
credibility, it's almost

65
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:04,900
game over.

66
00:02:04,967 --> 00:02:06,266
John: Now, that's a pretty

67
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,033
bold statement.

68
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,567
She's basically saying,

69
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:11,867
"go ahead, put 'Mr. oops' in

70
00:02:11,934 --> 00:02:12,867
charge of the department of

71
00:02:12,934 --> 00:02:13,500
energy, or a mint condition cpr

72
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:14,467
dummy in charge of opioids and

73
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:16,633
middle east peace, or hand the

74
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,600
commerce department over to a

75
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:18,834
man who looks like

76
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,800
Jackson pollock if he had lived

77
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:21,433
or Moby if he had died.

78
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,600
But the fed?

79
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:23,500
You don't fuck around with the

80
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:26,500
fed.

81
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:27,333
And that is because a lot of

82
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,100
America's economic power depends

83
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,734
on people's trust in the

84
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,066
stability of the dollar.

85
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:33,800
It is the world's reserve

86
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:34,867
currency in part because the fed

87
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:35,800
is seen as a reliable,

88
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:38,834
independent institution.

89
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,633
Trump has actually already

90
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,567
filled four of the fed's seven

91
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:42,834
seats... including the chairman,

92
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,367
Jerome Powell... but those

93
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:43,967
appointments didn't get much

94
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:44,567
press because all of these

95
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:45,633
people are fundamentally

96
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,767
qualified.

97
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:49,400
Cain and Moore, however, aren't.

98
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:50,333
Cain has argued for a return to

99
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,800
the gold standard, a virtually

100
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:53,667
unheard-of opinion among

101
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:55,533
respected economists, while

102
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Moore is a tireless advocate of

103
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,333
supply-side economics, he helped

104
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,100
design the tax cut that blew a

105
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,100
hole in Kansas' budget, and once

106
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,100
asked if the country even really

107
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,667
needs a fed.

108
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:08,734
But instead of spending time

109
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,967
breaking down why their economic

110
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:12,834
views should be disqualifying,

111
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,000
I'd like to make a point that

112
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:18,200
requires no knowledge of

113
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,233
monetary policy whatsoever, and

114
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,100
that is that these two guys are

115
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,066
goofs.

116
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:23,934
They're just a pair of

117
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,066
dangerously goofy goofs.

118
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:28,600
And this isn't actually a job

119
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,000
where that's okay.

120
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:29,734
Fed board members are famously

121
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,867
careful with anything they say

122
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:31,633
in public because markets can

123
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,967
react violently.

124
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:34,533
Just two words from the fed

125
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,667
chair sent markets soaring last

126
00:03:36,734 --> 00:03:37,667
November, and these two are not

127
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:39,433
known for thinking before they

128
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,500
speak.

129
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:44,266
Here's is Stephen Moore on a CNN

130
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,033
panel last year discussing

131
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,767
stormy Daniels and deciding to

132
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:47,266
blow the doors off the room with

133
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:52,500
this awesome joke.

134
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:53,734
We're discussing a sitting

135
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,867
president being sued by a

136
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:55,667
porn star, and it's part of

137
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:56,433
almost like the routine of

138
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,266
today's news cycle, which is the

139
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,300
interesting part of it.

140
00:03:58,367 --> 00:03:59,166
Kevin, are you saying that a

141
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:00,367
porn star would actually try to

142
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:01,867
call attention to herself?

143
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:09,000
Shocking, right?

144
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:09,900
I mean, that's what

145
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:10,767
porn stars do!

146
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:14,400
John: Nailed it.

147
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:16,133
You nailed it, Stephen.

148
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,967
You don't want that man's mouth

149
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:17,767
moving markets.

150
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:18,767
Now, as for Herman Cain, let me

151
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:19,834
remind you, this is a man who,

152
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,533
when he ran for president, once

153
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,033
asked a crowd of

154
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,000
Cuban-Americans, "how do you say

155
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:25,500
'delicious' in Cuban?,"

156
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:26,734
he bragged about not knowing the

157
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,667
president of

158
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:31,533
"uzbeki-beki-beki-

159
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,834
Stan-Stan," and had this

160
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,300
memorable moment in a

161
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:34,500
presidential debate:

162
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:35,867
A poet once said, "life can

163
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:38,166
be a challenge, life can seem

164
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:38,800
impossible, but it's never easy

165
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:39,900
when there's so much on the

166
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:40,934
line."

167
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,100
All right, so, it turns out

168
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,533
that quote wasn't exactly

169
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,667
poetry.

170
00:04:44,734 --> 00:04:46,200
It was, strictly speaking, a

171
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:48,400
song from the end of

172
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,400
"pokemon the movie" from 2000.

173
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,133
John: It's true.

174
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,767
It's true.

175
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:54,967
Herman Cain quoted this pokemon

176
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:56,800
movie during a presidential

177
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:58,600
debate, which is both the worst

178
00:04:58,667 --> 00:04:59,800
place to do that and also

179
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,834
technically the best place to do

180
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,467
it, because who on that stage is

181
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:05,233
going to risk calling you out?

182
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,500
"Excuse me, but I believe my

183
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:08,000
opponent just attributed that

184
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:09,467
quote to a poet, when it really

185
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:11,200
comes from the theme song to the

186
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:14,500
film 'pokemon the movie 2000,'

187
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:16,633
whose lyrics I also know by

188
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,500
heart, and oh, god, I'm just now

189
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:19,700
realizing this is worse for me

190
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:20,700
than it is for him, please carry

191
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,734
on.

192
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,166
Ignore what I just said."

193
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:25,967
And as if all that weren't

194
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:26,667
disqualifying enough, I know

195
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:27,934
personally that Herman Cain

196
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,400
should not be on the fed,

197
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:31,233
because after he dropped out of

198
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,533
that presidential race, I did a

199
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,367
series of interviews with him

200
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:35,200
for "the daily show" where he

201
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:36,233
pretended to be in office, and

202
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,633
in which he, for some reason,

203
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,500
did anything I asked him to do.

204
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:40,066
Anything.

205
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:42,133
Watch.

206
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,500
Look into that camera and

207
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:45,100
convince Nicolas cage to give

208
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:50,900
that constitution back.

209
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:52,934
Nicolas, bring back our

210
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,567
constitution.

211
00:05:58,633 --> 00:05:59,400
I respect you, cage, but get a

212
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:00,633
grip.

213
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,700
We have just had the results

214
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:02,500
back from your latest

215
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:03,900
presidential physical, and it

216
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:05,266
turns out you have telepathic

217
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,600
powers.

218
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,033
Look into that camera and

219
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,567
convince the Chinese that they

220
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:18,600
need to step down.

221
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:19,500
It's your move.

222
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:20,734
Oil is spilling everywhere

223
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,133
and it has devastated America's

224
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,066
national parks.

225
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,433
Gather those most affected and

226
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,533
explain to them why their

227
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:32,800
sacrifice is not in vain.

228
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:37,734
[Horn blares]

229
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,233
Creatures of the forest,

230
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,667
assemble!

231
00:06:43,734 --> 00:06:44,700
John: If any part of you is

232
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:45,800
thinking, how did I get him to

233
00:06:45,867 --> 00:06:47,333
do that stuff?

234
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,633
I just asked him.

235
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,033
Once.

236
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,200
He took orders from some

237
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:53,300
birdy twit with a pixie cut.

238
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:54,934
And look, at this point, you may

239
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,967
be wondering what trump sees in

240
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:00,066
these two men.

241
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:03,934
Well, just that.

242
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,467
He wants people who will do

243
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:07,367
exactly what he tells them to.

244
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:08,266
You've just seen how well Cain

245
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,200
takes direction, and Moore is

246
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:09,900
such a trump sycophant that he

247
00:07:09,967 --> 00:07:13,500
co-wrote a flattering book

248
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:14,433
called "trumponomics" and said

249
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,066
trump should win the nobel prize

250
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:15,900
in economics.

251
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,600
And this should be worrying to

252
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:17,734
you, as trump seems to be

253
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,633
looking to bring the fed under

254
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,500
his control.

255
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:20,734
He's reportedly furious that it

256
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,100
has raised interest rates,

257
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,333
slowing down the stock market,

258
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,900
and he's publicly attacked

259
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:25,533
Jerome Powell, a huge breach of

260
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,500
custom, and reportedly

261
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:27,900
considered firing him.

262
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:30,500
And if he manages to install

263
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:31,033
Moore and Cain, that could

264
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,467
fundamentally undermine the fed,

265
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:34,433
so it's important the senate

266
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,266
stand against these nominations.

267
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,467
And I know that this could be a

268
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:41,033
difficult fight, but as a poet

269
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,734
once said, "come with me, the

270
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,900
time is right.

271
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:45,367
There's no better team.

272
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:47,500
Arm in arm, we'll win the fight.

273
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,066
It's always been our dream.

274
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:51,233
Pokemon.

275
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,066
Gotta catch em' all.

276
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:56,033
It's you and me, I know it's my

277
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,567
destiny.

278
00:07:57,633 --> 00:08:04,867
Pokemon."

279
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:05,600
Let's move on now to Baltimore.

280
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:06,934
Baltimore is a great place to

281
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,367
get crabs if you can't find

282
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:09,567
post Malone.

283
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:10,934
Now, Baltimore has a long

284
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,367
history of corruption, but its

285
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:12,867
latest scandal is truly

286
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:14,734
remarkable.

287
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,667
Well, mayor Catherine pugh is

288
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:16,734
speaking out amid the ethics

289
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,934
controversy surrounding her

290
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,333
business dealings with the

291
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,700
university of Maryland medical

292
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:23,834
system.

293
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,367
The mayor had served on the

294
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:26,467
board of directors since 2001,

295
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:27,967
and throughout an eight-year

296
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:29,133
period, she sold the medical

297
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,767
system $500,000 worth of her

298
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:30,700
"healthy Holly" children's

299
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:34,100
books.

300
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,100
John: It's true.

301
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:35,767
Baltimore's mayor has apparently

302
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:37,367
made hundreds of thousands of

303
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,500
dollars off several local

304
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:39,767
entities, some of which have

305
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:41,300
business before the city,

306
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:41,900
purchasing her self-published

307
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:43,400
books, including "healthy Holly:

308
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:45,367
Vegetables are not just green,"

309
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:46,333
"healthy Holly: Fruits come in

310
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
colors like the rainbow," and

311
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:48,834
presumably, "healthy Holly:

312
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,700
Fruits come in vegetables but

313
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:50,834
only when they receive verbal

314
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,600
consent."

315
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:54,266
And look, look, it is hard to

316
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,600
believe pugh's books were purely

317
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,734
bought on the basis of literary

318
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,066
merit.

319
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:01,934
Reporters who've read them have

320
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,300
pointed out that, for a start,

321
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:04,333
she can't seem to settle on the

322
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,667
correct spelling of the name for

323
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:07,266
one of her main characters.

324
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,266
Also, she seems to think a

325
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,834
normal, healthy dinner involves

326
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,200
a family gathered around four

327
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:12,834
massive plates of salad with one

328
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,166
smaller salad that sits in the

329
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:15,567
center of the table untouched

330
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:18,133
while your dad says normal

331
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,033
things like, "we are having

332
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,233
spinach with our dinner.

333
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,333
It is a vegetable."

334
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,066
And finally, in her educational

335
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:25,900
children's book about eating

336
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:26,433
right, she spelled fucking

337
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,967
"vegetable" wrong.

338
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:30,166
And "vege tale" sounds like

339
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:31,734
slang that douchey bros use when

340
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,300
they pick up girls at vegan

341
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:34,734
restaurants.

342
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,934
"Yah, brah, I'm gonna gulp down

343
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,400
some quinoa, pretend I fucks

344
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:39,467
with Kale, and then try to smash

345
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:40,667
some of that vege tale.

346
00:09:40,734 --> 00:09:44,467
All day, son.

347
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,767
All day."

348
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:48,200
And the scandal widened this

349
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:49,834
week after it emerged that the

350
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,166
amount she has received from

351
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:52,667
high-profile organizations or

352
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:55,533
people has now reached $800,000.

353
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,533
Pugh is now on leave because

354
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,800
she's fighting pneumonia, but

355
00:09:57,867 --> 00:09:58,834
before she left, she called a

356
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,934
press conference to defend

357
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,867
herself.

358
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,433
And in this appearance, where

359
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,333
she was dealing with accusations

360
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,300
that she'd misused her office to

361
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:07,834
promote a side project, she did

362
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,600
this:

363
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,700
Mayor pugh also showed us her

364
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:11,767
child clothing line which has

365
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:13,667
slogans to get active on them as

366
00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:15,900
well.

367
00:10:15,967 --> 00:10:17,533
There was bibs and onesies.

368
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,433
John: It's true.

369
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,667
She basically started Hawking

370
00:10:19,734 --> 00:10:21,600
her idea for a kids' clothing

371
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:22,300
line, and she did it for three

372
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:24,967
full minutes.

373
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:27,633
As you can see from these

374
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,867
bibs, it was about teaching

375
00:10:29,934 --> 00:10:31,066
children to walk, run, crawl,

376
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:34,467
skip, dance.

377
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:38,633
Some to eat healthier.

378
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,367
To play and crawl.

379
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:42,934
And same thing here with the

380
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,633
messaging.

381
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,633
Swim, jump, play,

382
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,533
walk, run, crawl.

383
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,500
John: Okay, a few things

384
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:51,000
here: First, "walk, run, crawl,

385
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:51,834
skip, dance," sounds less like

386
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,066
something you'd put on a onesie

387
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:53,633
and more like something that

388
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,266
bjork whispers to you at the end

389
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,200
of a conversation instead of

390
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:56,700
saying "goodbye."

391
00:10:56,767 --> 00:10:57,800
"Walk, run, crawl, skip, dance.

392
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:04,200
Hee-hee!"

393
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:05,900
Second, second, if the clothes

394
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:07,367
you're making are that small,

395
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,934
your baby is not ready to swim.

396
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,233
And finally, how is a baby

397
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,233
supposed to learn healthy eating

398
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,734
habits from a bib that reads

399
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,400
"eat healthy"?

400
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:15,166
The baby can't see the bib when

401
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:15,900
it's on.

402
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,033
It just can't bend its neck far

403
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,500
enough.

404
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:18,367
And I know what you're thinking,

405
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:19,867
just look in the mirror, baby.

406
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:20,500
Look in the mirror after you put

407
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:21,667
your bib on but before you eat.

408
00:11:21,734 --> 00:11:22,867
But then, of course, the writing

409
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:24,333
will be backwards, making it

410
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,233
even more difficult to decipher

411
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,100
for a baby who already...

412
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,467
and this is true... cannot

413
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:30,367
fucking read.

414
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:33,600
But let's put all that aside and

415
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:34,166
let's say this baby can read

416
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:35,367
backwards, looks in the mirror

417
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:36,333
before a meal, and intuits the

418
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
message that it should eat

419
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:38,233
healthy.

420
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:38,900
It's still going to be

421
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:40,233
physically strapped into a chair

422
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,033
and fed whatever its parents

423
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,066
pick because babies have no

424
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:44,066
agency 'cause that's how babies

425
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:47,900
work.

426
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:49,734
Now, investigators are now

427
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,133
looking into this situation, and

428
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,000
while there have been no charges

429
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:53,900
so far, the whole thing does not

430
00:11:53,967 --> 00:11:59,467
look good for the mayor.

431
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:00,400
And unless there is some very

432
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:01,633
good explanation that I can't

433
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,633
see and does not exist, it

434
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,867
might be better for her to read

435
00:12:03,934 --> 00:12:05,467
the writing on the onesie and

436
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:10,033
walk, run, crawl, skip, dance,

437
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,266
her way out of office.

438
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,533
And now this.

439
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,700
Announcer: And now, a

440
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:14,567
tribute to the secret star of

441
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,433
divorce court.

442
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,100
Mr. Marino, did your wife

443
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,233
catch you with your situation

444
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:22,900
out on your phone, texting it to

445
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:24,200
other people?

446
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:27,333
It couldn't have been me.

447
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,033
I don't know.

448
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,333
I was like, well, I knew she

449
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,900
found out.

450
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,800
I'm just going to make up an

451
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:37,900
age.

452
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:40,200
We hang out all the time, so

453
00:12:40,266 --> 00:12:42,567
I wouldn't remember...

454
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:44,033
I do tend to react that way,

455
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,867
because my feelings be hurt.

456
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:45,633
Because that's how large the

457
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,000
argument was throughout those

458
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:47,767
few days.

459
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,100
You should have known I was

460
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,000
going out with some other guy.

461
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:51,800
Right.

462
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:58,934
Because I feel...

463
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,934
there's no "I guess."

464
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,600
If I say something...

465
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:01,266
a lot of the conversation was

466
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,300
because...

467
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:08,266
I did do that.

468
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,433
But that's not how we started.

469
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,233
She was in the backseat with

470
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,500
two dudes in the car.

471
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:13,133
Oh!

472
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,967
John: Moving on.

473
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:16,600
Our main story tonight concerns

474
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:18,100
mobile homes.

475
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:18,600
Perfected by humans, but

476
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:19,233
invented by snails.

477
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,700
There are many misconceptions

478
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:22,500
about mobile, or manufactured

479
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:23,166
homes.

480
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:24,567
For instance, right now, you may

481
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,133
be picturing something that

482
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:25,834
looks like this.

483
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,867
But for decades, the industry

484
00:13:26,934 --> 00:13:28,200

But it is true, it can be

genuinely hard to tell the

permanent location.

That's roughly 1 in 18

523
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,934
Americans, and they're one of

524
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,166
America's last affordable

525
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:36,433
housing options, costing up to

526
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,567
50% less per square foot than a

00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,700

00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:46,867
years, some of the biggest

investors in America

531
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:48,400
have moved into this industry.

532
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:49,367
According to one new report,

533
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:50,667
over 100,000 home sites,

534
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:51,533
traditionally run by mom-and-pop

535

00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,133
the richest people in America.

542
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,834

543
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,800
problems whatsoever.

00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:53,266
Now it's a matter of, "okay,

575
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,867
now which medication am I going

576
00:15:55,934 --> 00:15:57,200
to take and half so that I can

577
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:58,166
make it stretch out a little bit

578
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:04,800
longer."

579
00:16:04,867 --> 00:16:05,333
John: That's clearly

580
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:05,867
horrible.

581
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:06,834
Nobody should be made to stretch

582
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,633
out medicine.

583
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,600
It's sad enough when you stretch

584
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:09,533
out your almost-empty bottle of

585
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,133
shampoo by adding a bunch of

586
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,967
water.

587
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:11,667
And if you didn't relate to that

588
00:16:11,734 --> 00:16:12,834
joke, you haven't suffered a

589
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,133
single day in your life.

590
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,400
So tonight, let's take a look at

591
00:16:16,467 --> 00:16:18,333
the mobile home industry.

592
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,767
And let's start with the company

593
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:21,633
that sells more mobile homes

594
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,934
than any other, Clayton homes,

595
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,433
controlled by one of the richest

596
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,467
men in America, Warren buffett.

597
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:29,033
Although the company's ads used

598
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,233
to feature a more down-home

599
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,266
spokesman.

600
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,800
What do I know about

601
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:33,667
Clayton homes?

602
00:16:33,734 --> 00:16:34,934
I know they're built right here

603
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,367
in America.

604
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:37,133
And they know the difference

605
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,200
between a house and a home.

606
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:43,233
Hey, miss Kay, a home is where

607
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,467
you get your famous sweet potato

608
00:16:44,533 --> 00:16:45,266
pie, honey.

609
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,567
And you all know how we all

610
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:48,433
try to make miss Kay happy,

611
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,900
happy, happy.

612
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:50,233
Clayton homes.

613
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:50,734
Good call.

614
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,734
[Duck call]

615
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,033
John: Judging by that creepy

616
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,800
delivery, there is no way that

617
00:16:55,867 --> 00:16:56,867
"getting her famous sweet potato

618
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:58,667
pie" is not also code for some

619
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:01,767
kind of disgusting sex act.

620
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:03,233
It probably means miss Kay

621
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,500
smearing pie filling on his

622
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:06,166
ball sack while a live duck

623
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,333
scrapes it off with its bill.

624
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,033
And if it does, good call.

625
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,800
[Duck call]

626
00:17:12,867 --> 00:17:14,967
But the key difference between a

627
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:17,233
mobile and conventional home has

628
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,367
nothing to do with pie.

629
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:20,367
It has to do with how it retains

630
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:21,367
its value.

631
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:22,967
Just listen to finance guru

632
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:24,166
Dave Ramsey give his no-nonsense

633
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:25,767
take on whether or not you

634
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:27,133
should buy one.

635
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,133
Mobile homes go down in

636
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,166
value.

637
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:30,467
It's the only thing that you

638
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:31,900
own, that you live in, that goes

639
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,867
down in value.

640
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:36,767
Even if you buy dirt under it

641
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:38,867
that goes up in value more than

642
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:39,567
it goes down in value so it

643
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:40,867
appears you didn't lose money,

644
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,400
you lost money.

645
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:43,300
You buy a $50,000 mobile home,

646
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:45,033
in a few years, it's a $10,000

647
00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:46,333
mobile home.

648
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,300
I mean, cars go down in value,

649
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,400
mobile homes go down in value.

650
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,700
It's a car you sleep in.

651
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:52,000
John: I gotta say, I find the

652
00:17:52,066 --> 00:17:53,133
negativity of his tone genuinely

653
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,734
refreshing there.

654
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,133
That guy should replace

655
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,900
Jim cramer on his show.

656
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:58,133
No more running around excitedly

657
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,667
pressing buttons like a little

658
00:17:59,734 --> 00:18:01,467
boy at an arcade, just an angry

659
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:02,400
old grump hunched over a desk

660
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:04,467
telling you you're going to lose

661
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:06,834
money.

662
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,166
So mobile homes may be a

663
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:09,500
terrible investment for people

664
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:10,567
buying them, but they've been an

665
00:18:10,633 --> 00:18:11,800
incredible investment for

666
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:13,633
Warren buffett.

667
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,967
Clayton homes generated pre-tax

668
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:16,367
earnings of $911 million last

669
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:18,400
year, and they've done that not

670
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:20,367
just by selling homes but by

671
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,567
financing them as well, because

672
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,033
instead of being financed with

673
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,033
mortgages, mobile homes tend to

674
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,433
be bought with high-interest,

675
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,400
shorter-term chattel loans, the

676
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:29,767
kind you'd use to buy a car or a

677
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:31,600
TV.

678
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:33,133
And an investigation a few years

679
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,700
back found Clayton relies on

680
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:36,200
predatory sales practices,

681
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:38,033
exorbitant fees, and interest

682
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,967
rates that can exceed 15%,

683
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:41,233
trapping many buyers in loans

684
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,934
they can't afford.

685
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,100
Now, Clayton strenuously denies

686
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,600
all that, saying the report was

687
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,834
based on isolated incidents, and

688
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,200
its customers report high levels

689
00:18:50,266 --> 00:18:52,000
of satisfaction.

690
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:54,367
Although I will point out that

691
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,266
one of those isolated incidents

692
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,166
was this call a Clayton customer

693
00:18:58,233 --> 00:18:59,000
got when she fell behind on

694
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:00,367
payments.

695
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:01,567
Why don't you try something

696
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:02,533
to come up with the money by the

697
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,734
31st?

698
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,000
What should you... what do

699
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:07,600
you suggest except for the

700
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:08,667
things that you already suggest,

701
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:10,867
which doesn't work?

702
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:12,600
Donate plasma or donate

703
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:13,700
blood.

704
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:14,667
Really?

705
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:16,300
I'ma get $800 for that?

706
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:18,066
No.

707
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:19,100
But that's one way to come up

708
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,500
with a little bit of money,

709
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:21,266
though.

710
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,767
John: Holy shit.

711
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:24,967
"Go donate blood."

712
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:26,500
I guess one way to get your

713
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:27,900
customers to report high levels

714
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,300
of satisfaction is to make sure

715
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:30,734
they're all feeling light-headed

716
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,500
after you literally bleed them

717
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,533
fucking dry.

718
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,700
But one of the biggest problems

719
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:36,367
here isn't even to do with how

720
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:38,300
you pay for a mobile home or how

721
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,867
quickly it loses value.

722
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:41,433
It's where you put it.

723
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
Because around a third of

724
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:44,033
mobile home dwellers own their

725
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,867
homes but don't own the land

726
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,667
underneath it.

727
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:48,800
That's because they live in

728
00:19:48,867 --> 00:19:49,834
mobile home parks and pay rent

729
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,133
on that land to the park owner.

730
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,266
But in recent years, large

731
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,266
investors have been snatching

732
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,834
those parks up and either

733
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,367
tearing them down or ratcheting

734
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:00,667
up rent and fees, as these women

735
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:03,100
experienced first-hand.

736
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,433
The ingdol family decided to

737
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,700
sell the park and they sold it

738
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:09,467
to the Carlyle group.

739
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:11,166
First of all, Carlyle started

740
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:13,266
off with an immediate 8%

741
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,800
increase in space rent, so that

742
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:16,900
was a threat to most of us who

743
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:18,600
are living on fixed income.

744
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:20,533
I don't know what's gonna

745
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,333
happen.

746
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:22,834
I may be forced to leave

747
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,300
everything.

748
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:24,700
My doctors, my friends.

749
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:25,734
The life I've known here.

750
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,433
Even though I own my home.

751
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,133
John: It's true.

752
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,767
That woman may lose her home so

753
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:31,333
the Carlyle group, an investment

754
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,533
firm with $216 billion in

755
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,734
assets, can make more money for

756
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,667
shareholders.

757
00:20:38,734 --> 00:20:40,000
If the concept of "income

758
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:41,600
inequality" came to life, that

759
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:42,600
is the sentence it would scream

760
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:45,000
when it orgasmed.

761
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:46,333
Now, Carlyle... Carlyle insists

762
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,066
the price hikes were to pay for

763
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:49,367
park improvements... which makes

764
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:51,233
complete sense.

765
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,667
If you asked these fuckers why

766
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:55,433
they got into private equity,

767
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,400
I'm sure they'd say "to break

768
00:20:56,467 --> 00:20:57,734
even on investments in the

769
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,033
beautification of affordable

770
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,834
housing.

771
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:06,934
Why else would we do this?"

772
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,233
I also apparently have to tell

773
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,734
you that they have a safety net

774
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,934
program for low income

775
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,934
residents, although it only

776
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,567
applies for 81 of them, although

777
00:21:16,633 --> 00:21:19,500
it only attaches 3% of people,

778
00:21:19,567 --> 00:21:22,233
just like the one they use as my

779
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,600
favorite circus, a pile of dead

780
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:25,667
trapeze artists.

781
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:26,967
It's fun for the whole family!

782
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:27,600
Unless you're the family of one

783
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:28,667
of those trapeze artists.

784
00:21:28,734 --> 00:21:29,767
And if you're thinking, "well

785
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:30,367
look, that's terrible, but if

786
00:21:30,433 --> 00:21:31,333
those women live in mobile

787
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:31,867
homes, why don't they just

788
00:21:31,934 --> 00:21:32,667
move?"

789
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:34,100
There's a problem with that, as

790
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:34,667
one of those women will tell

791
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:35,133
you.

792
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,567
Although they call them

793
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:38,133
mobile homes, it would cost

794
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,333
$20,000 to move this home out of

795
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:45,800
here.

796
00:21:45,867 --> 00:21:46,467
Plus, it would... once you move

797
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:47,700
them in and they settle, moving

798
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:48,300
them out's gonna help destroy

799
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:48,967
them.

800
00:21:49,033 --> 00:21:50,033
John: She's right.

801
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,233
It can cost thousands of dollars

802
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,367
to move mobile homes, if you can

803
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:54,066
move them at all.

804
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,033
That's why 80% of mobile homes

805
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,600
never move.

806
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:58,333
So mobile homes are mobile about

807
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,367
as much as a king crab is

808
00:21:59,433 --> 00:22:02,600
actually a king.

809
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,300
It's just not... except in some

810
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:05,967
parts of Alaska, where it wields

811
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,000
the power of a despot... but

812
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:08,533
even then, it constitutionally

813
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,066
shares power with

814
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:11,166
moose parliament.

815
00:22:11,233 --> 00:22:13,834
So "king" is really a more

816
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,233
ceremonial title.

817
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,433
Alaska is a fascinating place.

818
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,834
And this lack of mobility for

819
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,266
tenants is actually part of the

820
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,834
attraction for big investors.

821
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,333
And to see just how cynical and

822
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,000
predatory the industry can be,

823
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:26,934
meet frank rolfe.

824
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,967
His company is one of the

825
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:29,633
largest park operators in the

826
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,100
us, controlling over 30,000 home

827
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,433
sites in 25 states.

828
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,300
Rolfe is an evangelist for the

829
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:35,734
wonders of mobile home park

830
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,333
investing.

831
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,667
Just look at this uplifting

832
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:39,567
message that he made ahead of

833
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:41,133
the 2012 election about what it

834
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,233
would mean for his industry,

835
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,266
taped, for some reason, in front

836
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:44,967
of a shitty green screen oval

837
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:46,667
office.

838
00:22:46,734 --> 00:22:48,266
If mitt romney wins, things

839
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:54,567
are good.

840
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:56,200
And if Barack Obama wins, things

841
00:22:56,266 --> 00:22:56,467
are good.

842
00:22:56,533 --> 00:22:57,400
You see, it doesn't much matter

843
00:22:57,467 --> 00:22:58,100
who wins the election.

844
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,166
All that matters is that the

845
00:22:59,233 --> 00:23:00,567
statistics show that Americans

846
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:01,633
will continue to get poorer in

847
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,900
that lower half of the

848
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,133
population.

849
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,667
John: Wow.

850
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:08,767
What president webcam is

851
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:09,500
essentially saying there is,

852
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:10,667
"no matter what happens, the

853
00:23:10,734 --> 00:23:11,333
poor will suffer, and we will

854
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,066
feast on their rich marrow.

855
00:23:13,133 --> 00:23:14,033
And, as you can see, it's casual

856
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,233
Friday here at the white house,

857
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,533
which is why I sit before you

858
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
looking like a divorced dad at a

859
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:23,266
parent-teacher conference."

860
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:24,767
Rolfe is shameless about the

861
00:23:24,834 --> 00:23:25,633
degree to which his business

862
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,133
depends on having a captive

863
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,734
customer base, positively

864
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,133
comparing it to running a

865
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,467
waffle house where everyone is

866
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:33,333
chained to the booths, a concept

867
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,133
so deeply chilling, I think it

868
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,967
may have just inspired

869
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:41,934
Jordan peele's next movie.

870
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,200
Now you should know, rolfe

871
00:23:43,266 --> 00:23:43,800
maintains that line was taken

872
00:23:43,867 --> 00:23:44,400
out of context.

873
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:45,033
In fact, he has a whole page on

874
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,934
his website about it, claiming

875
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,800
he was just talking about the

876
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:48,200
"incredibly consistent revenues"

877
00:23:48,266 --> 00:23:50,400
in mobile home parks.

878
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:51,467
So he wasn't suggesting that

879
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:52,667
he's a heartless person whose

880
00:23:52,734 --> 00:23:54,000
customers are stuck there with

881
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:54,533
him holding all the cards

882
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,667
deciding for himself how high he

883
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,266
wants their rent to go.

884
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,467
To see him say that, you'd need

885
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:01,200
to enroll in his online

886
00:24:01,266 --> 00:24:02,800
mobile home university, which we

887
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:03,633
did, and found seminars like

888
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:08,367
this:

889
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:09,233
What I've found, and again,

890
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,300
just as a heartless person, is

891
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:14,333
that, you know, the... the

892
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,667
customers are stuck there.

893
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:16,233
They don't have any option.

894
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:16,834
They can't afford to move the

895
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,867
trailer.

896
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:19,367
They don't have three grand.

897
00:24:19,433 --> 00:24:20,000
So the only way they can... they

898
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:20,834
can object to your rent raise is

899
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,300
to walk off and leave the

900
00:24:22,367 --> 00:24:24,400
trailer, in which case it

901
00:24:24,467 --> 00:24:25,133
becomes abandoned property and

902
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,133
you recycle it... put another

903
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,200
person in it.

904
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:28,266
So you really hold all the

905
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,133
cards.

906
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,767
So the question is, what do you

907
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:30,767
want to do?

908
00:24:30,834 --> 00:24:31,500
How high do you want to go?

909
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:32,500
John: Wow.

910
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:33,233
Usually when someone is that

911
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,200
contemptuous of poor people,

912
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:37,133
they're immediately visited by

913
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,734
the ghost of Christmas future.

914
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,400
Now, maybe... maybe rolfe will

915
00:24:39,467 --> 00:24:40,700
claim that quote is out of

916
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:41,934
context too, and that he's not

917
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,700
arguing they're hostages.

918
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:45,166
To hear him say that, you need

919
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,266
to send away for rolfe's audio

920
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:47,700
seminar on running mobile home

921
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:49,233
parks, which we also did, and

922
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,233
found this:

923
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,500
One of the big drivers to

924
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:55,734
making money is the ability to

925
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,166
increase the rent.

926
00:24:57,233 --> 00:24:58,266
If we didn't have them hostage,

927
00:24:58,333 --> 00:24:59,333
if they weren't stuck in those

928
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,066
homes in the mobile home lots,

929
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:01,767
it would be a whole different

930
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:02,667
picture.

931
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,100
John: Frank rolfe's

932
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:04,633
mobile home university is

933
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,333
basically a crash course in how

934
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,000
to be an asshole.

935
00:25:09,066 --> 00:25:09,800
Although having taken that

936
00:25:09,867 --> 00:25:10,533
course, I'd argue that if that's

937
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,333
what you're looking for, save

938
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,467
your money and just follow

939
00:25:12,533 --> 00:25:13,467
piers Morgan on Twitter for one

940
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:18,200
afternoon.

941
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,433
And, look, rolfe's course isn't

942
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,233
just online.

943
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,200
If you attend his mobile home

944
00:25:23,266 --> 00:25:24,433
boot camp, he'll even take you

945
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,967
on a field trip tour of a park.

946
00:25:26,033 --> 00:25:26,533
When you get to the park,

947
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,633
you'll be shocked and turned off

948
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,800
by, for example, the beach towel

949
00:25:28,867 --> 00:25:29,967
in the window instead of an

950
00:25:30,033 --> 00:25:31,467
actual curtain.

951
00:25:31,533 --> 00:25:33,400
That doesn't mean anything.

952
00:25:33,467 --> 00:25:34,000
What you gotta worry about are

953
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,567
the following items:

954
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:36,967
Infrastructure, density,

955
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:37,800
expense, age of home, and

956
00:25:37,867 --> 00:25:39,166
location.

957
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:40,200
Got it?

958
00:25:40,266 --> 00:25:42,533
What's going on?

959
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,867
They're teaching people about

960
00:25:43,934 --> 00:25:44,266
mobile home parks.

961
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:44,767
Oh.

962
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:45,633
Yeah.

963
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,233
That's good.

964
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,467
John: No, it isn't, though.

965
00:25:48,533 --> 00:25:50,800
It's really not good.

966
00:25:50,867 --> 00:25:51,400
Telling that woman people are

967
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,367
just there to learn about

968
00:25:52,433 --> 00:25:53,567
mobile home parks is like

969
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:54,800
telling a lobster people came to

970
00:25:54,867 --> 00:25:56,033
the restaurant to learn about

971
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,934
crustacean habitats.

972
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,300
"Oh!

973
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:00,567
That's good!

974
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:01,633
Are those knives and forks to

975
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,333
help remove these tiny rubber

976
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,300
bands from my claws?"

977
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:04,233
No.

978
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,834
They're going to eat you.

979
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:07,133
So with that woman and many

980
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,867
mobile home residents like her

981
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,133
in danger of having their lives

982
00:26:10,233 --> 00:26:10,767
turned upside down, it is worth

983
00:26:10,867 --> 00:26:11,633
asking, is there anything that

984
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:17,200
can be done here?

985
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:18,166
Well, one potential solution is

986
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:19,233
for residents to band together

987
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,900
and buy their own park, keeping

988
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:21,600
it out of the hands of

989
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:22,633
speculators or developers.

990
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,567
And while that sounds inherently

991
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:24,967
like a long shot, there are

992
00:26:25,033 --> 00:26:25,567
nonprofit groups that have had

993
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:26,633
real success in helping tenants

994
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,300
get financing to do just that.

995
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:29,500
What would help is to have laws

996
00:26:29,567 --> 00:26:30,834
in every state that give

997
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,934
residents the right of first

998
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,533
refusal and time to raise funds

999
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,567
if the current owner plans to

1000
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:37,800
sell.

1001
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:38,867
But until laws like that are put

1002
00:26:38,934 --> 00:26:40,900
in place, which there absolutely

1003
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:42,533
should be, there are some key

1004
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,800
things to bear in mind: If you

1005
00:26:43,867 --> 00:26:44,633
want to rent a mobile home,

1006
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,066
fine.

1007
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:47,033
If you can afford to buy one and

1008
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,367
put it on land that you own,

1009
00:26:48,433 --> 00:26:50,166
fine.

1010
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,600
But buying a mobile home and

1011
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:53,266
renting the land underneath it

1012
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:56,100
can be financially catastrophic.

1013
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:57,633
And it is very important that

1014
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,700
anyone considering doing that

1015
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:02,734
knows the risks involved.

1016
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,367
And I'll tell you what would've

1017
00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:04,133
been helpful all along, if the

1018
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,633
marketing for these homes had

1019
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:11,367
always made those risks clear.

1020
