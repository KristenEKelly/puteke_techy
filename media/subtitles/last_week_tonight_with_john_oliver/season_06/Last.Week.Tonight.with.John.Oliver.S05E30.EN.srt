LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,040
SEASON VI
EPISODE 30

3
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,760
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,720
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,080
Let's dive in with the latest
developments in "Stupid Watergate II".

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,880
The sequel that could only get
worse if it added Jar Jar Binks.

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,880
He is scheduled to testify
before Congress on Thursday.

8
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,080
A dramatic week
in the House impeachment inquiry,

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,360
featuring damning public testimony
from three State Department veterans

10
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,080
and a closed-door interview with
another official, David Holmes,

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,160
about a phone call between Trump
and EU ambassador Gordon Sondland.

12
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,280
Holmes' opening statement
leaked to the press

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,600
and reporters went through it on-air,
live, learning eye-catching details.

14
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,760
Trying to go through the entire
details of this right now.

15
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,360
Trump clarified that Ambassador
Sondland was in Ukraine.

16
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,400
Ambassador Sondland replied yes,
he was in Ukraine

17
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,400
and went on to state that
President Zelensky "loves your ass".

18
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,120
It's true.
He apparently said that.

19
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,360
I am gonna quibble with your
choice of emphasis there.

20
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,920
I think he meant "loves your ass",
not, as you put it, "loves your ass".

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,440
I would understand
if it was the latter.

22
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,240
This guy is a smokeshow with dumps
like a truck and thighs like what.

23
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,720
I'm not saying he's a good president.
I'm saying he's thicc.

24
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,200
Holmes testified that Sondland said
Trump doesn't give a shit about Ukraine

25
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,280
and cares about stuff that benefits
him, like the Biden investigation.

26
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,440
It is difficult to defend all that.

27
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,480
Not to say that Republicans
have not been trying hard.

28
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,680
It might be worth breaking down
each of their defenses,

29
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,760
you're gonna be hearing a lot
of them in the next months.

30
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,160
The first technique is to insist
there is nothing to see here,

31
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,800
because nothing happened.

32
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,640
Attempted bribery
isn't in the Constitution.

33
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,640
Ukraine got its military aid,
it was 14 days delayed, big deal.

34
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,960
Ukraine never made any public
statement about any investigation.

35
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,200
So, wait, hold on.

36
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,760
Because the deal didn't go through,
it didn't matter.

37
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,960
A crime doesn't stop being
a crime if it doesn't work.

38
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,720
If you tried to blow up an airliner
and your vest doesn't go off,

39
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,240
you don't get to go:
"Well, no harm, no foul"

40
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,000
and watch "Detective Pikachu"
for the rest of the flight.

41
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,320
Ukraine only got its aid after
the House started asking questions.

42
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,040
The president was days away from
announcing investigations,

43
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,680
but canceled at the last minute,
after this story started breaking.

44
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,200
The "nothing to see here"
defense is pretty shaky.

45
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,520
Republicans' next tactic is to claim

46
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,600
the only evidence against Trump
is hearsay.

47
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,000
A point Jim Jordan
tried to drive home

48
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,080
by reading a section
of Sondland's testimony out loud.

49
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,240
Taylor recalls that Mr. Morrison told
Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison

50
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,880
that I conveyed this message
to Mr. Yermak on September 1st, 2019

51
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,920
in connection with Pence's visit to
Warsaw and a meeting with Zelensky.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,880
Six people having four
conversations in one sentence

53
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,720
and this is where
you got your clear understanding.

54
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,320
Everything is harder to understand
when you rush through it

55
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,200
like you're listing side-effects
at the end of a Lunesta commercial.

56
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,000
It's the same way I tend to say a lot
of words fairly quickly

57
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,920
and jokes can slip by you
like they're Greta Thunberg

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,440
and you're guarding
Epstein's prison cell.

59
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:03,160
It just means I need to slow down
so everyone can realize

60
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,320
she didn't care who was on the flight
logs, she hated that he flew so often.

61
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,200
The point with the whole hearsay
argument, though,

62
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,600
is that multiple people
have gone on record

63
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,800
saying the president was pressuring
Zelensky for his own political gain,

64
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,680
including his own chief of staff,
Mick Mulvaney, who did so on camera.

65
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,040
The fact that there was
a quid pro quo is all hearsay,

66
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,720
in that you hear people say it
all the fucking time.

67
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,520
That is why they've come up
with a fallback defense:

68
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,680
"There was a quid pro quo,
but those are actually totally fine."

69
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,360
Here is a Republican county chair
giving that defense a spin.

70
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,600
Presidents make deals.
They kinda twist arms.

71
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,040
Not violently. I'll scratch your back
if you scratch mine.

72
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,200
You don't think he's opened
himself up for today,

73
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,120
he put himself in hot water, creating
the reasons for this hearing ?

74
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,360
No. I really don't.

75
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,480
It's like, do we want Trump
not to be Trump ?

76
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,560
Yes. So badly.
I want Trump not to be Trump

77
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,600
more than I want anything else
in the world right now.

78
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,680
I would take any kind
of "Freaky Friday" situation.

79
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,160
I would be happy if he switched
bodies with a raccoon.

80
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,240
Trump would too ! He wouldn't deal
with the impeachment inquiry

81
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,640
and he'd get to keep
his all-trash diet.

82
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,080
There is an obvious problem
with that argument.

83
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,640
Of course, presidents make deals.
Yes.

84
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,320
But they are supposed to conduct
American foreign policy in a way

85
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,920
that benefits the country,
not themselves.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,520
It's why Teddy Roosevelt's mantra was
"Speak softly and carry a big stick"

87
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,160
and not: "Speak softly and try to get
as many sticks as possible",

88
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,480
"for your personal stick collection."

89
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,520
Technique three is to pretend
that the details of this scandal

90
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,880
are too boring to care
about to make people disengage.

91
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,480
Watch Fox Business host Stuart Varney
try and sell that idea.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,640
It was unutterably boring !
Did you watch any of this stuff ?

93
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,960
With Richard Nixon,
there was a break-in.

94
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,400
With Bill Clinton,
there was sex in the Oval Office.

95
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,960
With Trump, it's a call to Ukraine.
What the devil is that all about ?

96
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,520
I'm sorry this gigantic abuse of power
isn't sexy enough for you, Stuart.

97
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,840
If robbery and sex are what you want,
the Russia scandal had hacked emails

98
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,320
and Trump did pay $130 000
to a porn star.

99
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,080
Do either of those scandals
turn your crank, Stu ?

100
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,040
Pick the Trump scandal you prefer,
there's one for everyone !

101
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,240
And the final tactic here is to claim

102
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,640
that this story is too complicated
for people to understand.

103
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,800
Where there's no quid or pro,
you can't keep saying "quid pro quo".

104
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,680
I don't even know what that means.
I don't know what language is.

105
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,200
- It's Latin.
- Is it Latin ?

106
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,320
Yes, it is Latin.

107
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The only thing there
more shocking than the stupidity,

108
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,440
is watching someone be accurately
corrected by Steve Doocy,

109
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,320
a man whose business card reads,
and this is true, "An Idiot".

110
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,720
This story isn't actually
that complicated at all.

111
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:22,920
The president seems to have withheld
foreign aid approved by Congress,

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,880
to get something
that would benefit him personally.

113
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,080
That is a bribe.
That is a shakedown.

114
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,560
White House officials knew
his pressure tactics were wrong,

115
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,080
because they hid information
about it in a top-secret server.

116
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,360
That isn't boring, it's not hearsay,
not standard practice for presidents

117
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,920
and it's really important that Trump
be held to account, here.

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,600
If he gets away this,
we are sending a message

119
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,360
that he can essentially
get away with anything.

120
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,960
And if that is the case, to paraphrase
an unqualified diplomat,

121
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,040
you better love Trump's ass,

122
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,120
'cause it might not be leaving
office any time soon.

123
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,680
And now this.

124
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,240
A Look Back At Al Roker Delivering
The Thanksgiving Kiss Of Death.

125
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,760
Americans lining the streets
and poking out of windows,

126
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,320
all cheering on the marchers,
including 6 000 Macy's employees.

127
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,800
A lot of them have to be fans of NBC's
new hot comedy series "Marry Me".

128
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,480
Cancelled 6 months later.

129
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,080
Temperature always hot
on NBC's new medical drama "Mercy".

130
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,680
Cancelled 6 months later.

131
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,600
I'm surrounded by happy actors,

132
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,920
the stars of the new NBC hit
comedy "Happy Family".

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,080
Cancelled.

134
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,400
New NBC comedy
called "Committed".

135
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,360
Got a new show out, "Kath & Kim".

136
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,880
We remember
the original "Knight Rider".

137
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,880
Must see TV series "Constantine".

138
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,240
"Telenovela".

139
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,000
"Clash of the Choirs".

140
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,440
Right here on NBC.
Matt, Savannah, back to you.

141
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,360
Cancelled 6 days later.

142
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,760
Moving on. This is actually
our final show of the year,

143
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:05,480
so we take a look at something that
will be underway once we get back

144
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,200
and that is the census.

145
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,840
The only reason to open
the door for a stranger,

146
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,240
unless he tells you
he has candy in his van.

147
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,280
In that case, you gotta see what
he's offering ! What if he has fudge ?

148
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,920
The census is a longstanding
American tradition and, every decade,

149
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,040
the government rolls out eyecatching
TV ads to encourage participation,

150
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,560
like this one from 1980.

151
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,240
In 80 million mailboxes
across the USA.

152
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,160
The census is a comin',
to help us plan the way.

153
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,400
To show us where we're going
so that we can understand

154
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,320
What's needed for the future,
the future of our land.

155
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,120
Can we count on you ?

156
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,760
You can count on me.

157
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,120
Can we count on you ?

158
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,840
You can count on me !

159
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,400
Okay. That is a beautiful song.

160
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,680
It's no "Eat Shit, Bob,"
but frankly, what is ?

161
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,640
More importantly,
can we count on you, Mickey ?

162
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,680
It's 1980, you're in a tuxedo
in the middle of the day

163
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,720
and your pupils are the size
of personal pan pizzas.

164
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,600
We know what that means, Mick:
you've been baking with booger sugar.

165
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,280
Hawking the rawdilla. Riding
the white rail express to Blowmaha.

166
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,200
I'm trying to say: Mickey Mouse
has a really serious cocaine problem.

167
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,440
I'm just stating a fact.
A Disney fact.

168
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,840
The concept
of the census is very simple:

169
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,520
at the start of each decade government
does a comprehensive count

170
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,200
of every person
residing in the United States.

171
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,840
Not just citizens. Not just voters.
Every single person.

172
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,840
Only by knowing
how many people live where,

173
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,040
can communities plan to provide
things like roads,

174
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,400
schools and emergency services.

175
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,120
It's usually
conducted through mail-in forms,

176
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,440
supplemented by in-person interviews,

177
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,240
as this training film
for the 1940 Census shows.

178
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:00,240
What are the names of the other
persons living here, Mrs. McGee ?

179
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,720
There's me and my husband,
William H.,

180
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,840
and our two sons
John J. and William H. Jr.

181
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,120
We have to count babies, also.
Are there any babies here ?

182
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,640
No, not anymore.

183
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,920
What ?
What did you say ?

184
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,960
What kind of weird
fucking answer is that ?

185
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,440
I'm calling it right now:
that woman ate her baby.

186
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,600
That is a fact.
That is a Disney fact.

187
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,360
However hard counting
every single person seems,

188
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,480
it's actually much harder.

189
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,840
Some groups can be particularly
tricky to count, including children,

190
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,240
those living in remote areas, homeless
people, and of course, the Olsen twin.

191
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,920
They will tell you that there are two
of them, but one of them is lying.

192
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,480
To accomplish this, the government
opens 250 regional offices,

193
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,040
hires half a million temporary workers

194
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,840
and mails notifications
to over 140 million households.

195
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,200
Conducting the census is the largest,
most complicated peacetime operation

196
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,880
the government undertakes.

197
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,760
The 2020 Census is likely to be
more challenging than usual,

198
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,400
from budget shortfalls,
to active Republican meddling.

199
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,320
So tonight, let's talk about it.
And let's start

200
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,040
with what questions
are actually on the census.

201
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,320
A lot of people
don't know what they are,

202
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,720
and that very much includes
the current president himself.

203
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,920
They go through houses. They
ring doorbells, they talk to people.

204
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,880
How many toilets do they have ?
How many desks,

205
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,400
how many beds,
what's their roof made of ?

206
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,080
What are you talking about ?

207
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,200
No one would go to your house
and ask how many toilets you have,

208
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,000
because the answer should be
the same for everyone and that's four !

209
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,000
One for pees, one for poops,
one for guests, and one for groups.

210
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,640
You know,
the normal amount of toilets.

211
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,400
The census asks you
just a few basic questions:

212
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,520
your name, age, sex,
race or ethnicity,

213
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,800
how many people live in your home
and how they're related

214
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,000
and whether you rent or own,
that is essentially it.

215
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,800
Yet, some people still do not
want to engage with the census.

216
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,840
Partly because nobody likes
filling out surveys

217
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,000
and partly because when
the government asks questions,

218
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,560
people can get paranoid.

219
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,840
There is a subgenre of YouTube videos
from the last census

220
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,760
where libertarians filmed themselves
taunting census workers.

221
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,760
Like this one, filmed by a man
who insisted the census

222
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,280
was unconstitutional
and then added this to the mix.

223
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,600
- What is your first name ?
- I can't answer.

224
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,320
You don't want to give names ?

225
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,440
That's way too personal
of information...

226
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,000
It's nothing against you,
but you're a stranger.

227
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,320
I can show you news stories
of census workers

228
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,240
that have come back
and raped and killed people.

229
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,480
I didn't even know that.

230
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,680
Hold on there.
'Cause two key things there...

231
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,920
That census worker seems like a very
nice lady who has never killed anyone.

232
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,040
And two, you are being so obnoxious
I would honestly understand

233
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,320
if she was tempted
to break that streak.

234
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,600
Everyone knows: the census
is very much constitutional.

235
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,120
In fact,
it's not just in the Constitution,

236
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,560
it's the sixth fucking sentence,
think how significant that is.

237
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,000
Freedom of speech didn't even
make it in there at all.

238
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,680
They had to tack that on later

239
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,480
in the 18th century equivalent
of a Post-It note.

240
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,000
It is important that people
participate in a census.

241
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,840
Data is used to evenly distribute
political power across the states.

242
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,040
Seats in the House of Representatives
are divided up based on population.

243
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,760
After every census,
adjustments are made.

244
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:59,320
After the last one, Texas gained
four seats and Ohio lost two.

245
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,560
Some states are anxious
about being under-counted,

246
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,680
as this story
from Minnesota shows.

247
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,320
The eighth congressional seat we have
we've held on to it for some time.

248
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,640
We barely held on to it in 2010.
And in 2020,

249
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,360
it looks like we're
in the same situation again

250
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,840
where we're very close
to losing that seat.

251
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,600
That would be bad for them !
Losing a seat in Congress

252
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,000
is much like losing one
in musical chairs,

253
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,320
someone is gonna be
very disappointed.

254
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,480
Only this time, it's an entire state
and not just Aidan.

255
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,440
I'm sorry, Aidan,
but you've got a slow butt.

256
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,720
Better you learn to live
with it now.

257
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,760
Census data plays a crucial role
in directing government funding.

258
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,120
Hundreds of federal programs
use census data to distribute

259
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,720
$880 billion
to states and localities.

260
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,280
If your community's population
count is off by a tiny percentage,

261
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,320
it can have real consequences.

262
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,920
Take the city of Circle Pines,
Minnesota.

263
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,040
In the last census,
they were just 82 people shy

264
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,280
of the 5 000-person threshold required
to qualify for state roads funds.

265
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,560
Local officials were frustrated,

266
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,360
because they believed
they'd had an undercount.

267
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,480
They do not want
that to happen again

268
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,200
and luckily, they have found
the hero that Circle Pines deserves.

269
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,960
I became Census Man

270
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,520
when I was elected to lead
the census initiative in our city,

271
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,000
which is
a vitally important initiative.

272
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,040
I love the fact that there
is a census-themed superhero.

273
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,920
His superpower seems to be reminding
people the census exists.

274
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,520
It's like if Batman
didn't fight crime,

275
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,560
he just wandered around and told
people interesting facts about bats.

276
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,360
Bats can eat up to 1 200
mosquitoes an hour !

277
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,000
Goodbye,
enjoy your mugging, citizen !

278
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,960
We haven't even got into the fact
that businesses also use census data

279
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,840
to decide where
to add jobs or open stores.

280
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:04,120
It is vital to get the census right.
That is why it's so unfortunate

281
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,760
that the president seems to think
it's a waste of time and money.

282
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:14,000
They're spending $15 billion
or some ridiculous amount on a census.

283
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,800
I don't know why we can't do that
through the computers of the world,

284
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,040
that's the way you can do a census
and probably a lot more accurately.

285
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,320
Obviously there is a lot there,

286
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,600
but let me pick up on
"computers of the world".

287
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,480
I refuse to take computer advice
from Donald Trump.

288
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,520
Have you ever even seen him
use one ?

289
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,280
Can you even picture that happening
in your mind ?

290
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,920
Donald Trump, clicking a mouse ?
Typing with his fingers ? No way !

291
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,200
Here is a photo that he posted
during a Reddit AMA,

292
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,600
and he looks like he's scared
that if he touches the laptop,

293
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,840
it will burn him.

294
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:58,080
As for that whole cost issue,
Congress underfunded the bureau

295
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,000
by hundreds of millions
of dollars for years,

296
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,440
and critical preparations
for this census needed to be made.

297
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,280
That is not good, because next
year, for the first time ever,

298
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,120
the bureau will be asking most
people to answer the census online.

299
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,920
Which could make
counting everyone easier,

300
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,920
provided the government's
website works properly.

301
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,720
You do not want another
Healthcare-dot-gov on your hands,

302
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,320
a website whose launch was so flawed
that, you may well recall,

303
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,960
only six people were able to use it
to sign up for health insurance

304
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,240
on its first day.

305
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,640
Fun fact: those six people ?
The cast of "Friends" !

306
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,560
Could they be any luckier ?

307
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,240
To avoid problems, typically,

308
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,280
the bureau does multiple full-scale
test runs in different locations

309
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,040
to make sure that everything
is not only working,

310
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,600
but that it will work in
a variety of difficult-to-count areas.

311
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,200
It had planned to do three
test runs this time,

312
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,400
in an urban setting, a rural setting
and on tribal lands.

313
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,680
Thanks to budget constraints,
it ended up only doing one,

314
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,720
in Providence County,  where they
didn't even have a marketing budget.

315
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,280
One library tried to help there,
by offering people coupons

316
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,560
for $5 off late fees if they filled in
a census on a tablet computer there.

317
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,680
But the results were underwhelming.

318
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,160
How long has this been up,
about, in the library ?

319
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,640
A couple weeks, I guess.

320
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,080
How many people
came through to, to use it ?

321
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,040
Unfortunately...
A lot of people have looked at it.

322
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,440
So far we've had one
that I can vouch for.

323
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:40,400
One person's come in and done it.
The coupon was an incentive on that.

324
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,960
I actually have a confession here:
I am that man.

325
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,200
I had $233 000 in late fees
in Providence, Rhode Island.

326
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,680
Now I have $232 995.
And guess what ?

327
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,760
I'm still not returning the copy of
"Eat, Pray, Love" I borrowed in 2004.

328
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,200
I just committed the perfect crime.
Admitting it on camera,

329
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,840
probably isn't ideal,
but no fucking regrets.

330
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,600
The 2020 Census was always
going to be a big challenge.

331
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,960
Instead of being able to focus
their attention on these issues,

332
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,000
the bureau has had to expend time
and energy dealing with this shit.

333
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,480
Overnight the Trump
administration announced a move

334
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,600
that could impact the balance
of power for years to come.

335
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,840
The 2020 Census will ask about
citizenship for the first time in decades.

336
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,160
Wilbur Ross
announcing the decision

337
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,400
following a request
by the Justice Department.

338
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,120
Last year, Wilbur Ross,
who is in charge of the census

339
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,320
and what you would get if you put Elmer
Fudd in the oven at 425 for 90 minutes,

340
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,640
he announced a citizenship question
would be added to the census.

341
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,760
The bureau's chief scientist said would
harm the quality of the census count.

342
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,640
Which makes sense, doesn't it ?

343
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,800
If you have the government
asking people if they are citizens,

344
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,080
many may choose not to respond
out of fear the information

345
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,320
could be used against them
or people in their household.

346
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,720
Despite the fact it is against the law
for the bureau to disclose

347
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,560
any private information that
identifies an individual to anyone,

348
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,240
not the IRS, not ICE,
not anyone.

349
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,400
Personal census information
is kept confidential for 72 years,

350
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,200
by which point, let's face it,
we will all be dead.

351
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,440
Probably by that census worker's
hand, once she gets a taste for blood.

352
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,560
At the time, Wilbur Ross claimed
it was the Justice Department

353
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,680
who had requested that question
to enforce the Voting Rights Act.

354
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,040
Which seemed like bullshit,
because voting rights has never seemed

355
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,400
exactly like a top priority
for this administration.

356
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:56,720
It later emerged that it was Ross
who had pressured the DOJ

357
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,360
to request
the question from him.

358
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,720
The reason why involves this guy,

359
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,440
a Republican redistricting strategist
named Thomas Hofeller.

360
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,440
Here he is delivering
a very funny joke very well.

361
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,920
Redistricting
is like an election in reverse,

362
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,000
it's a great event.

363
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,880
Usually, the voters
get to pick the politicians.

364
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,360
In redistricting,
the politicians get to pick the voters.

365
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,560
Damn. You nailed it, Tommy.

366
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,480
What he is saying
there is really bad.

367
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,600
He is just reciting a major systemic
problem with the cadence of a joke.

368
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,320
Which was also, incidentally,
the original title for this program.

369
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,880
That man died last year.
His death ended up exposing

370
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,480
Wilbur Ross' true reasons for asking
the citizenship question.

371
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,360
When Hofeller's estranged daughter
began to go through his things,

372
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,600
she found something
very surprising.

373
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,520
His daughter finds these zip drives
and on the zip drive

374
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,880
is this trench of information
that essentially shows

375
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:09,400
that he had engineered this as a plan
to suppress minority votes.

376
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,000
It's true: his daughter found
documents on the hard drive

377
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,280
that laid out Republicans' strategy
to suppress minorities' voting power

378
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,680
and to use the Voting Rights Act
as a cover.

379
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,320
Which is appalling,
but one of the least horrifying things

380
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,800
you could find on a hard drive
belonging to your dead father.

381
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,000
On that point, if I ever die

382
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,320
and anyone finds mysterious
hard drives belonging to me,

383
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,160
assume they contain a shady
gerrymandering scheme I'm involved in.

384
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,800
Don't even click,
just throw it straight out.

385
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,120
It's definitely
a gerrymandering scheme

386
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,000
and not my collection
of hamsters in tiny Speedos.

387
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,240
If it were that, there would be
nothing wrong with it

388
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,240
because it's not technically illegal,
I checked,

389
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,000
but that doesn't matter anyway
because it's not my collection,

390
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,600
it's talking points
about my gerrymandering scheme.

391
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,400
I'm glad we all got that clear.
I'll see you later.

392
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,760
Hofeller had proposed the citizenship
question so he could make it easier

393
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,840
for Republicans
to hold onto power.

394
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,040
He and the Trump administration were
in close contact about the whole thing.

395
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,520
The scheme
was so impossible to justify,

396
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,440
three courts ruled against it,
and finally the administration lost

397
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,720
in front of the Supreme Court
and the question was dropped.

398
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,560
The citizenship question
will not be on the census next year.

399
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,680
It will not be on the census.

400
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,880
Here's the problem though,

401
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,920
those who work with immigrant
communities say the damage

402
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,120
might unfortunately already be done.

403
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,920
The anxiety and fear among
Chicago's Latino families remains

404
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:51,920
despite Trump's decision to back off
on the citizenship question.

405
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,360
The reluctancy is there

406
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,400
because the environment
has been already created to deter them.

407
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,360
Exactly. They've now created
an environment of fear.

408
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,920
People will still be looking
over their shoulder, terrified.

409
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,840
As that woman should
probably be

410
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,800
because Susan Skellington
is right behind her,

411
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,280
waiting to pounce.

412
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,640
Look out !
It's Susan.

413
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,000
There is a lot working
against this census.

414
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,400
Experts are worried an undercount
next year is inevitable,

415
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,240
the only question is by how much
and the fear is it could be millions.

416
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,480
So, what can we do ?
It's actually relatively simple:

417
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:37,800
all of us living in America now
need to fill out the census next year.

418
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,680
You've seen a lot of people trying
to persuade you to do that tonight,

419
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,040
from a superhero without superpowers,
to an aspiring serial killer,

420
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,160
to a coked-up mouse.

421
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,840
If you don't want to participate
in the census for them,

422
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,160
or for yourself,
or for your community,

423
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,440
I'll give you one more
good reason to participate.

424
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,120
And that is that it would
probably really irritate this guy.

425
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,480
His administration already thinks
that certain people don't count.

426
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,520
What better way to get back at him,
than to make sure that you do

427
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,800
and make the census count you.

428
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,280
Just to make him extra mad,
why not include a note

429
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,480
telling him
how many toilets you have ?

430
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:24,040
Which, remember, should be four,
the normal amount. Disney fact.

431
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,320
And now, this.

432
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:33,720
Another Installment Of Coming Up
On "Inside Edition" !

433
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,240
Do not mess with this woman.
She's 6'1 and ex-military.

434
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,040
Plus, no more bananas ?
And danger zone...

435
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,440
The stairs in your own home.
Plus, the Botox Bandit !

436
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,040
Then, jet ski investigation.
And burger mystery.

437
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,600
You can actually drive 50 feet with
your eyes closed when you sneeze.

438
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:03,600
Invasion of the goats !
Plus... Grumpy old man.

439
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,240
Why does this keep happening ?

440
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,080
What are you doing, Mister ?

441
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,760
There's a bear in my closet !
And gator in the kitchen !

442
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,280
What the heck is that thing ?
Hitchhiking snake !

443
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,120
Then, yep ! He's gay.

444
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,480
Moving on.
Look, finally tonight, before we go,

445
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,080
we just wanted to say thank you
for watching this show this year.

446
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,800
We have had a lot of fun.
We robocalled the FCC,

447
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,120
baked the world's largest marble cake
to spite the leader of Turkmenistan,

448
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,200
we climbed a fake Mount Everest

449
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,720
to show why climbing
the real one is a bad idea

450
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,480
and we did an elaborate musical
to tell a coal tycoon to eat shit.

451
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,240
We haven't heard from Bob Murray.
But I'm sure he loved it.

452
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,400
We also got obsessed with
a Japanese mascot called Chiitan.

453
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:01,000
Chiitan was the hyper-violent
unofficial otter for the city of Susaki

454
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,360
and also the star
of videos like this one.

455
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,760
Excellent.
That's excellent.

456
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,480
After Susaki broke ties with Chiitan,
their official mascot, Shinjo-kun,

457
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,600
was left alone, and look,
that broke our hearts.

458
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,440
We did something
uncharacteristically sweet for us,

459
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,640
and we created our own
replacement mascot, Chiijohn,

460
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,920
a nearsighted otter.

461
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,720
We sent him to Japan
to find Shinjo-kun.

462
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,280
He came on a little strong at first,
but they became great friends

463
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,720
and have been living
in Susaki together ever since.

464
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,560
The whole saga was heartwarming,
wholesome, and the exact opposite

465
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,080
of what it feels like
being alive right now.

466
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,600
I've been thinking
a lot about these two lately,

467
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,240
because next year, let's face it,
it is going to be unpleasant.

468
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,440
It is a presidential election year,

469
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,840
so things are gonna get even more
toxic than they already are.

470
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,120
I've found myself often craving

471
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,040
for these two's particular brand
of unmitigated joy.

472
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,920
I tried to get in touch with them.
Here's what happened.

473
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,560
THE JOURNEY OF CHIIJOHN
CHAPTER 2

474
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,800
It had been a rough year
and Hejohn was very sad.

475
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,400
He missed his friends
who lived very far away,

476
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,960
so he decided to write them a letter.

477
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,200
He wound up and threw it
as far as he could. Perfect.

478
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,640
On a distant shore, Chiijohn
and Shinjo-kun sat by the river.

479
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,920
The tide was about to change.

480
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,960
- "Dear Friends".
- The letter said.

481
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,120
I wanted to call you, but I have AT&T
so this seemed a more reliable option.

482
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,720
It's been an exhausting year
and next year is looking worse.

483
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,320
I wish we could see each other.
Hejohn.

484
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,600
Reading the letter broke their
otter hearts, it was so sad.

485
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:35,040
Hejohn had AT&T.
Suddenly, Chiijohn had an idea.

486
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,640
Chiijohn and Shinjo-kun packed
all they'd need for a long journey

487
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,480
and borrowed a snack, or two.

488
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,440
On the way to the airport they
said goodbye to all the local fish.

489
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,520
"We're dead," replied
the local fish. "But good luck."

490
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,880
Chiijohn and Shinjo-kun were
so excited for their 13-hour flight,

491
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,880
although the same
could not be said of everyone.

492
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,840
Stuffed between two giant otters,
yet again.

493
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,520
At last, America !

494
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,040
Right away,
they had trouble fitting in.

495
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,360
They took what they assumed
was the subway.

496
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:21,480
Soon they were in the heart
of New York, America's Susaki.

497
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,720
But no one there seemed
to recognize Hejohn.

498
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,400
"Are you sure he has a television
show ?" Asks Shinjo-kun.

499
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,960
They found a club for comedy.
Maybe Hejohn was a member.

500
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,960
"That man looks just like him,
it must be his adult son !"

501
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,480
Emboldened by his two drinks,
Chiijohn tried comedy himself.

502
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,480
Chiijohn killed.
Local fish really do be like that.

503
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,560
Someone heard they had been looking
for TV's best late-night host

504
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,800
and told them where to find him.

505
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,640
They had come to the right place,

506
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,320
but this wasn't Hejohn,
it couldn't be.

507
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,440
This man was funny,
charming and handsome.

508
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,200
"Very handsome",
said Shinjo-kun.

509
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,880
Hejohn couldn't be here
because Hejohn was sad.

510
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,960
And how could anyone be sad
at a place like NBC ?

511
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,920
"Come on", Chiijohn said.
"Hejohn needs us."

512
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,400
But they started to worry
that they would never find him.

513
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,480
They sat down a moment to rest and
a local artist captured their sadness.

514
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,920
Chiijohn and Shinjo-kun
didn't recognize themselves.

515
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,360
Then again, whoever really does
in the eyes of others ?

516
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,080
Chiijohn and Shinjo-kun had
reached the end of the city.

517
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:10,480
There was nowhere left to look.
Their hope dwindled with the daylight.

518
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,040
The tide hadn't changed
the way they'd wished.

519
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,240
But that's the funny
thing about tides,

520
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:23,840
they might not change when you want
them to, but they never stay the same.

521
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,640
Hejohn had been trying
to see Susaki.

522
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,560
In the end,
it was Susaki who saw him.

523
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,400
It was a good surprise.

524
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,880
Hejohn hadn't realized
surprises could be good anymore.

525
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,400
For the first time in a long time,
Hejohn dared to hope.

526
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,520
"Soon, it will be a new day",
Hejohn said.

527
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:34,800
"Where we're from", Chiijohn replied,
"it already is".

528
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,160
That's our show,
thanks for watching this year.

529
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,320
We'll see you next February,
good night !

530
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,960
How's it going ?

531
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:56,280
Shinjo-kun, you really like Seth ?
You really like him ? He's very good.

532
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,920
