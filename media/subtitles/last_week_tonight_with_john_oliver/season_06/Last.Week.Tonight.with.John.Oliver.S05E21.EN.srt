00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,160
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,640
SEASON VI, EPISODE 21

3
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,680
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,360
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,920
A quick recap of the week.
In which a lot happened,

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,960
Hickenlooper dropping out
of the presidential race,

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,240
he's one of these three men,
it's impossible to know which,

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,880
to a Russian airplane crashing
into a field with no one dying

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,600
or as it's more commonly
known, a "Dry Sully".

10
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,840
And then, of course,
there was this.

11
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,040
NBC News has confirmed

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,440
President Trump has talked to aides
and members of Congress

13
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,440
about possibly buying Greenland.

14
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,080
Yeah, of course he fucking did.
Of course he did.

15
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,320
Greenland is icy, distant and
semi-autonomous. It's Trump's type.

16
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,200
Speculation on Trump's comments
rose to such a point this week

17
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,240
that Greenland's premier
had to issue a statement:

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,240
"Greenland is not for sale."

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,680
If you had "Two and a half years"
in your office pool

20
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,680
of "When a leader would have to tell
Trump: 'You can't buy our country'"

21
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,960
congratulations,
you're a big winner.

22
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,680
But for now, let's turn to a different
diplomatic hot spot: Hong Kong.

23
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,920
It is the city equivalent of using
Hulu with your ex-boyfriend's account,

24
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,720
it's basically free, but that
could change at any minute.

25
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,680
For weeks now, Hong Kong
has been in a state of upheaval.

26
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,680
Hong Kong near the brink
after a day of violence

27
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,840
that shut one of the world's busiest
airports for a second day in a row.

28
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,840
International travelers caught
in the standoff

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,280
with hundreds of flights canceled
as luggage carts blocked passengers

30
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,080
pleading with protesters
to make their flights.

31
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,680
Come on !
You're being really selfish now !

32
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,680
I get that he's frustrated,
but he's in a tough spot there.

33
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,160
Come on, guys.
I need to catch my flight !

34
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,920
Can you tone down your fight
for democracy for a bit ?

35
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,040
Not saying don't try to maintain
your grasp on freedom,

36
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,720
but could you take it down
so I can get to my gate ?

37
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,920
Come on guys,
you're being selfish !

38
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,160
Protests began over a bill
that allowed China

39
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,960
to extradite Hong Kong
citizens to the mainland.

40
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,000
Opponents feared were part of a plan
to undermine Hong Kong's autonomy.

41
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,400
Protestors have
been very resourceful,

42
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,640
using umbrellas as shields and
lasers to disorient police

43
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,480
and circumventing a prohibition
against marches

44
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,760
by organizing them
on apps like Tinder.

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,400
Which is fantastic news
for anyone in Hong Kong

46
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,320
struggling to explain what they
were doing looking at Tinder.

47
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,000
I was recruiting protestors.
Female protestors age 24 to 29,

48
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,960
interested in public sex,
threesomes and assplay.

49
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,240
That's really what
this movement is all about, right ?

50
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,560
Chinese government
has been flexing its muscles,

51
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,880
moving armored carriers
to the border,

52
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,040
claiming protesters
"show signs of terrorism".

53
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,840
Within China, state media
has framed the protests

54
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,680
as the work of foreign forces,
one in particular.

55
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,200
There are indications
showing that there are

56
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,120
extraterritorial forces who've
played a horrible role in this chaos.

57
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,160
There are pictures of foreign agents
giving protesters money,

58
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,600
encouraging them
to mold public opinion.

59
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,760
Who are they ?

60
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,760
It's fair to say the CIA has spent over
70 years plotting in Hong Kong.

61
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,440
No one is saying the CIA does
not have a long, shitty history

62
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,000
of meddling
in other countries' politics.

63
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,680
It's helped re-installed the shah
in Iran,

64
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,400
it sponsored the Bay of Pigs Invasion
and it created "Paw Patrol",

65
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,480
to brainwash the planet's toddlers
with an authoritarian worldview.

66
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,600
All indications are that that's what
is happening in Hong Kong is local

67
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,600
and the result of long-simmering
internal tensions.

68
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,520
And if this is an American plot,
one thing is for sure:

69
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,160
nobody told the president.

70
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,520
Trump not only barely seems aware
of what's going on there,

71
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,480
he also gave China a green light
to do whatever they want,

72
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,080
like when he said this
at the start of the month.

73
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,680
Something's happening
with Hong Kong

74
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,840
because when you look at
what's going on,

75
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,320
they've had riots
for a long period of time.

76
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,760
I don't know
what China's attitude is.

77
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,520
Somebody said that at some
point they're gonna want to stop that.

78
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,040
That's between Hong Kong and China,
Hong Kong is a part of China.

79
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,200
They'll have to deal with that.
They don't need advice.

80
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,080
Nailed it.

81
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,080
Somehow there's both a lot
and nothing to unpack there,

82
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,360
but I will say this:

83
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,640
"They're gonna wanna stop that"
is the wrong message to send to China.

84
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,280
Anything would have been better.
If he'd said:

85
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,120
"What do I think of Hong Kong ?
It's strong, angry,"

86
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,720
"I don't like when it throws
barrels at Mario",

87
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,080
I'd think "You're thinking
of Donkey Kong, not Hong Kong,"

88
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,600
"you didn't wink at the possible
use of force, so no harm done."

89
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,680
Trump giving China a tacit endorsement
to use force against protesters

90
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,360
is not remotely surprising.

91
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,640
He sends the wrong signals
to other countries all the time.

92
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,560
Until his term ends, we'll live
with the fact that we have a president

93
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,040
who looks at America's allies
and says: "Go fuck yourselves",

94
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,040
looks at Russian interference
and says: "No big deal"

95
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,240
and looks at Greenland and says:
"200 bucks plus Don Jr., final offer."

96
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,440
And now this.

97
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,480
It's That Time Of Year Again...
Again.

98
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,840
Starbucks offers Pumpkin Spice Latte
starting this month on the 27th.

99
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,520
That's two weeks from today,
the earliest it has ever started.

100
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,920
Behold ! Pumpkin Spice Latte
has returned earlier than ever before !

101
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,920
Not that I'm complaining,
because I am a PSL lover,

102
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,720
but that's not even fall yet.

103
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,640
- August 27th, right ?
- 21st is next Wednesday.

104
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,560
On Wednesday we ride through
the nutmeg gates

105
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,840
to rain frothy steamed milk
upon your souls !

106
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,080
That is the earliest launch ever
for the so-called PSL's.

107
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,960
You know summer's over when they
whip out the pumpkin latte.

108
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,520
Give up ! You can't escape
the sweet oblivion of the spice !

109
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,160
I don't know what its called
"pumpkin spice",

110
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,760
there's no pumpkin in it.

111
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,120
You fool !

112
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,160
The glory of the spice is beyond
your feeble human comprehension !

113
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,560
Starbucks saying they'll be
introducing that treat,

114
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,280
which for some reason, like McRibs,
has a cult-like following.

115
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,960
Indeed !
It is... kind of like the McRib !

116
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,720
Pumpkin Spice Latte, pumpkin spice
coffee usually coming out in the fall,

117
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,920
but now,
SPAM wants to jump in this.

118
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,600
Yeah !

119
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,080
Let the feast
of the pumpkin meat begin !

120
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,440
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns doctors:

121
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,280
rated number one by "Reasons There's
a Finger in Your Ass" magazine.

122
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,600
Doctors held a position of high
esteem in society for generations,

123
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,480
as you can see in the 1930s
film, "Men of Medicine".

124
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,160
In every U.S. city and town,

125
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,400
there is one house that everybody
knows, the doctor's.

126
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,160
Available here are the services
of the man who by law is privileged

127
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,240
to practice the most respected
of all professions.

128
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,760
Only doctors have the privilege of
shoving a stick into a child's mouth

129
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,880
and diagnosing the condition that we
in the 1930s know as "gross throat".

130
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,840
The cure for it is drowning !

131
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,320
While medicine may be "the most
respected of all professions",

132
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,920
not everyone has the same experience
when they visit a doctor.

133
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,560
I would have been treated
differently if I had been male.

134
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,480
You'll hear doctors and nurses
like: "They're just exaggerating."

135
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,240
Not really listening to them
because it's a black person.

136
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,560
If it's like a white person, it's like:
"My god, like, this is serious."

137
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,440
If you are a woman, and/or
a person of color in the U.S.,

138
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,040
you may have a different relationship
to our health care system

139
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,320
than a white man.

140
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,120
Who better to talk at you
for 20 minutes about this

141
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,760
than me,
the whitest of white men ?

142
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,400
I get a sunburn watching
the Travel Channel.

143
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,240
I'm a walking cider doughnut,
pale, filled with cake

144
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,200
and found at every farmer's
market in the northeast.

145
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,880
This is a discussion
we need to have.

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,920
While the vast majority of doctors
are doing hard work

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,680
with sometimes-limited resources,
bias in medicine is an issue.

148
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,960
It's not the only factor
in determining health outcomes,

149
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,760
it can have a massive effect.

150
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,920
So tonight, let's talk about bias
in medicine, in two specific areas,

151
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,800
first sex and then race.

152
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,760
In the words of every therapist
I've had, let's start with sex.

153
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,000
Women's bodies have been fraught
with judgment and misconceptions.

154
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,920
Mom, can I go swimming
with Peggy tomorrow after school ?

155
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,640
No, it's not a good idea the first
two or three days of your period.

156
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,720
You might get chills
and catch cold.

157
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:29,320
That's right. Peggy, of course I can't
go swimming. I've got the curse.

158
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,360
Yeah, Peggy ! What are you, an idiot ?
She's got the curse !

159
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,520
She can't swim.
She'll fucking sink.

160
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,320
In the fifties, women referred
to their period as "The Curse".

161
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,000
Breasts were "The Haunted Mountains",
butts were "The Valley of Doom",

162
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,200
pregnancy was "The Happening",
giving birth was called "The Babadook".

163
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,200
It was a very scary time
to be a woman.

164
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,320
Things have improved since then,

165
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,160
but women can still face an uphill
battle to get quality healthcare.

166
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,440
There are many studies showing this.
They found that women were less likely

167
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,040
to be referred for knee replacements
than men.

168
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,080
If over 50 and ill, less likely
to receive lifesaving interventions.

169
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,800
When going to the ER
with urgent abdominal pain,

170
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,760
women were less likely
to receive any pain medicine.

171
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,400
Listen to one doctor sum up

172
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,480
how too many in her profession
treat female patients.

173
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,800
A lot of times, women's
symptoms, especially pain,

174
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,920
are attributed
to emotional imbalance

175
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,640
or women being hysterical
or crying wolf about their pain.

176
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,120
That's wrong.

177
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,000
Of course it is. The only time
it's understandable for a doctor

178
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,480
not to hear a woman's
complaints about pain

179
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,600
is if she's calling into the office
and she's got AT&T.

180
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,760
Because the calls
keeps dropping out !

181
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,160
Boom, business daddy,
I got you again !

182
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,560
Business baby woke up all cranky.

183
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,320
I'm airing my dirty diapers
in public again !

184
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,600
I'm high-maintenance.

185
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,520
While some of this may have to do
with implicit bias on doctors' parts,

186
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,520
there is also a systemic problem,

187
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,000
where doctors may literally
know less about women's bodies.

188
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,960
Historically, medicine
has studied men's bodies,

189
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,600
which here means
those assigned male at birth,

190
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,240
as a proxy for all bodies.

191
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,560
As one researcher will tell you,
the reason was incredibly dumb.

192
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,560
There's this assumption that you
are me with pesky hormones.

193
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,440
With pesky hormones.

194
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,920
The idea is that the fundamental things
are similar between you and me.

195
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,240
So, that ironically the best way
to study you is to study me.

196
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,080
Because you don't have
pesky hormones.

197
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,720
We study the fundamental
things without this nuisance stuff.

198
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Women are full
of "nuisance stuff".

199
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,080
It's why medicine
has long chosen to believe

200
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,080
that women
are just hormonal men.

201
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,080
Also, children are tiny men,
dogs are furry men,

202
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,880
trees are big hard still men,
birds are men who can fly,

203
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,640
fish are men who can glub
and volcanoes are men

204
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,840
who, for some reason,
ejaculate lava.

205
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,520
And this idea that women
are just men with pesky hormones

206
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,480
has led to some woman-shaped
blind spots in medicine.

207
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,120
For decades, women were excluded
from medical research trials,

208
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,040
in part because their menstrual
cycles would complicate the results,

209
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,840
which you would think
would be all the more reason

210
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,440
to include them in tests, because
women are half the population

211
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,360
and can respond to treatment
or drugs differently.

212
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,960
In some cases their exclusion
was ridiculous,

213
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,520
as this news report
from the nineties shows.

214
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,800
In 1990, the Journal of the National
Cancer Institute published this report

215
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,640
which looked at the impact
of diet on estrogen, metabolism,

216
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,760
and its links to cancer
of the breast and uterus.

217
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,680
All of the subjects were men.

218
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,240
They studied a way to prevent
cancer of the uterus

219
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,840
on people who did not have one,
that's ridiculously unhelpful.

220
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,640
It's like studying
healthy conflict resolution

221
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,080
surveying
the Real Housewives of New York.

222
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,040
They've resolved no conflicts !

223
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,520
Luann's pissed
about Dorinda's fish room,

224
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,760
Ramona's uninvited
at the clambake,

225
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,960
Tinsley's furious because they laughed
'cause she froze her dead dog.

226
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,840
The group's dynamic is still a mess !
The show's all the better for it.

227
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,800
When you have the male body
as the default reference

228
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,880
and doctors who might not take
women's pain seriously,

229
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,800
the consequences can be deadly.

230
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,000
Take heart attacks.
You think of them

231
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,240
looking like they do
on TV all the time.

232
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,200
People grabbing their chest
and then falling over.

233
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,040
But for many women,
that is not what they look like.

234
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,800
Their heart attacks present
subtler symptoms

235
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,480
like pain in the back or jaw,
nausea and unusual fatigue.

236
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,160
Lots of doctors miss that.
Look what happened to Katherine Leon,

237
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,000
who went to the ER
with serious heart problems...

238
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,600
The young doctor came in,
very condescending,

239
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,440
thought I was just
a drama queen, and he said:

240
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,320
"It's not my job to tell you
what's wrong with you,"

241
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,200
"it's my job to tell you what it's not
and it's not your heart."

242
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,880
And that was it. I was like:
"Well what do I do next ?"

243
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,600
and he's like: "You go home."

244
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,280
That doctor managed to find
literally the only time

245
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,880
that telling someone
to go home is bad advice.

246
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,200
Having a bad day at work ?
Just go home !

247
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,600
At a party stuck next to a guy who
wants to talk about Bitcoin ?

248
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,880
Go home !

249
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,480
You're on second and your buddy
grounds a single into left field,

250
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,880
the outfielder picks it up,
but you realize he's overthrown ?

251
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,160
Go home !
Go home, now !

252
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,640
Katherine Leon
was having a heart attack.

253
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,920
She should not have been sent home !
She's by no means alone.

254
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,760
Women
who came to the hospital

255
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,440
with heart-attack symptoms
were seven times more likely than men

256
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,160
to be misdiagnosed
and sent home.

257
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,120
Terrible. The only thing a woman should
be seven times more likely to do

258
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,640
is recognize those Real Housewives
references from earlier !

259
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,920
Even that is not remotely okay !
That show is both a nuanced

260
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,800
and searing portrayal of wealth,
power and loneliness in Manhattan,

261
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,760
themes that can transcend superficial
boxes in which it's confined.

262
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,800
It's our
"Much Ado About Nothing"

263
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,800
and Andy Cohen
is our Shakespeare.

264
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,640
But that's not the point.
It's a very good point.

265
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,400
It's an excellent point. But it's not
the point we're making here.

266
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,400
Which is, sex and gender bias
can clearly distort medical outcomes.

267
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,440
But they are not the only forms
of bias that can do that.

268
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,440
If I may quote the inside of Trump's
head when energy at one of his rallies

269
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,480
seems to be flagging:
"Let's get to the racism stuff."

270
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,040
There's a disparity in life expectancy
between black and white Americans,

271
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,840
particularly for black men.

272
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,640
When one study tried to quantify
the "mortality gap",

273
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,400
they found shocking numbers,

274
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,400
which this documentary illustrated
in the most jarring possible way.

275
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,280
We found over 83 000 excess
deaths per year

276
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,200
in the African-American
community alone.

277
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,880
83 000 excess deaths each year.

278
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,200
That's the equivalent of a major
airliner filled with black passengers

279
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,280
falling out of the sky
every single day, every year.

280
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,960
Okay, but that's such a weirdly
specific way to put that.

281
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,680
You don't need to take a number
that's already a disaster

282
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,000
and put it in terms
of another disaster.

283
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:24,240
Is like four double-decker buses
driving into each other every 6 hours.

284
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,840
It's 32 hot-air-balloons
exploding every minute for a week.

285
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,520
It's the death of Princess Diana,
83 000 times. I get it.

286
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,920
It's pretty bad, I get it.

287
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,000
Clearly, there are systemic factors
contributing to that number.

288
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,280
Even when it comes to contact
with the health care system,

289
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,400
there can be appalling disparities.

290
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,880
Many studies show African-Americans
have a lower likelihood

291
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,600
of receiving recommended care
for everything

292
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,800
from pneumonia, to hip fractures,
to multiple cancers.

293
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,680
While there's no one cause
for these disparities,

294
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,520
it doesn't help that, as a study
of med students and doctors found,

295
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,000
three years ago, misinformation about
African-American patients is rampant.

296
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,560
The study found some doctors believed
there are biological differences

297
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,120
between the two races.

298
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,640
25 percent of doctor residents
thought blacks have thicker skin.

299
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,680
Holy shit. You do not expect
to hear that at a medical school.

300
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,680
You barely expect to hear it
yelled across a table

301
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,120
by a racist grandfather
at Thanksgiving.

302
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,240
What are you talking about,
Grandpa ?

303
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,160
His skin isn't thicker than yours.
Even if it were,

304
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,400
that is not why
you didn't vote for him.

305
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,240
That is not the only insane
belief that that study found.

306
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,080
14 percent of second year
med students agreed

307
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,680
black people's nerve endings
are less sensitive than whites',

308
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,960
which they aren't.

309
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,280
17 percent believed that black
people's blood coagulates

310
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,520
more quickly than whites',
which it obviously doesn't.

311
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,880
I wouldn't be surprised to learn
86 percent of them believe

312
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,040
that Irish jizz
is green on holidays.

313
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,520
Not even just St. Patrick's Day.
All holidays. Even Yom Kippur.

314
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,400
That's the worst
time to ejaculate.

315
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,520
It is impossible to say exactly
where they came by those beliefs,

316
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,280
but medical textbooks
are not immune from bias.

317
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,160
This nursing textbook was available
until just two years ago,

318
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,120
when it was pulled after it emerged
that it featured statements like:

319
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,440
"Hispanics may believe that pain
is a form of punishment"

320
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,280
"and suffering must be
endured to enter heaven."

321
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,800
African-Americans "believe
suffer and pain are inevitable"

322
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,320
and Native Americans
"pick a sacred number"

323
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,000
"when asked to rate pain
on a numerical scale."

324
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,080
You expect that a textbook might have
typos or outdated information.

325
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,480
You do not expect it to basically
say: "Hispanics think God is kinky"

326
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,680
and "Native Americans
will tell you wizard numbers !"

327
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,040
Misconceptions like those can have
tangible effects on treatment.

328
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,920
If a quarter of all medical residents
think black people have thicker skin

329
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,680
and nurses have been told that
they think suffering is inevitable,

330
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,520
that might lead to black patients'
pain being treated differently.

331
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,720
Which happens.
Wanda Sykes summed this up best.

332
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,640
Because of racism, black people,
we don't even get our hands on opioids.

333
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,880
They don't even give them to us.

334
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,880
White people get opioids
like they Tic Tac's.

335
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,360
It amazes me how many opioids
you mother fuckers have.

336
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,000
I had a double mastectomy,

337
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,560
you know what they sent
my black ass home with ?

338
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,160
Ibu-fuckingprofin.

339
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:49,760
From now on, Advil should absolutely
call itself "Ibu-fucking-prophen".

340
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,800
That is non-negotiable.
That has to happen.

341
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,600
That's by no means unusual.

342
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,720
One recent analysis found that black
patients were 34 percent less likely

343
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,080
to be prescribed opioids for pain
than white patients.

344
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,040
While there are a lot of good
reasons to prescribe fewer opioids,

345
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,320
"my patients are black"
is just not one of them.

346
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,360
If you consistently have bad
experiences with health care,

347
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,960
you might be less inclined
to seek help in the future.

348
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,760
Listen to this woman,
diagnosed with lupus,

349
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,920
describe how she was impacted
by the response from doctors.

350
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,040
It was just this belief
that I was making things up,

351
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,960
what I was saying wasn't real,

352
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,840
that I must be seeking drugs
or selling the drugs.

353
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,400
That's what you were getting
in the doctor's office ?

354
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,680
Absolutely.

355
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:49,840
What happens is you start to develop
fear around going to the doctor.

356
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,560
Yeah, of course you'd be
frightened to go to the doctor,

357
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,360
if you thought they'd treat you
like a drug dealer.

358
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,560
I'm terrified and the worst
thing doctors said to me was:

359
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,560
"You're 42 and you
should no longer need to be bribed"

360
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,560
"with a lollipop to get a flu shot."

361
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,360
But I want one. I want a wowwipop.
I've been very brave !

362
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,000
Give me a wowwipop.

363
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm not saying all doctors are racist,
or sexist, they obviously aren't.

364
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,040
But people have biases
and doctors are people.

365
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,320
They may've come up in a system
that, intentionally or not,

366
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,240
has discounted the experiences
of a major portion of the population.

367
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,280
And their biases
have life or death consequences.

368
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,640
There's no starker expression of where
sex and race can negatively impact

369
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,320
health care outcomes
than maternal mortality.

370
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:44,760
The US has the highest rate of maternal
mortality in the developed world.

371
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,760
Which is already terrible, but it gets
even worse for black women.

372
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,440
If you're a woman of color,
especially if you're black,

373
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,520
your odds of dying in childbirth
are four times higher in our country.

374
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,880
Why ? 'Cause you're not talking
about access to health care,

375
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,560
about money or education.

376
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,680
No. And this is gonna be
hard to hear:

377
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,480
we believe black women less
when they express concerns

378
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,920
about the symptoms they're having.

379
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,320
Yeah. And that is hard to hear.
It is worth really underscoring

380
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,360
what he just said:
these racial discrepancies exist,

381
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,160
even when you control
for socioeconomic factors

382
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,560
like education
or insurance status.

383
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,960
We are literally disbelieving
black women to death.

384
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,680
And that is appalling
enough in theory,

385
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,840
but it's heartbreaking in practice.

386
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,280
Take Kira Johnson,
who gave birth to a son,

387
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,400
only for things to go horribly wrong.

388
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,080
Her husband said
she waited hours for a CT scan.

389
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,280
When doctors took the situation
seriously, it was late.

390
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,600
She died in surgery.

391
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,160
Her husband still wonders what
he could have done differently.

392
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,680
I sit awake at nights thinking:

393
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,120
Maybe I should have grabbed
somebody by their collar, right ?

394
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,840
I should have turned the table over !
I thought about the whole issue...

395
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,640
I didn't want to be seen not only as
angry, but angry black man right ?

396
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,840
I'm not the smallest guy
in the world.

397
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:08,440
And what that would mean
and how we would be perceived

398
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,840
and how we would be treated
as a result of that perception.

399
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,080
When this first happened,
I would get the question a lot:

400
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:20,120
"You think would be different if Kira
was white or was a different color ?"

401
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,960
And the way I answer is:

402
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,960
the simple fact that you have
to ask that question is a problem.

403
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,560
Yeah, it is.
It's a huge fucking problem.

404
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,800
That's devastating.
A woman no one would listen to.

405
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,200
And a man who feared he'd be judged
for the color of his skin.

406
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,680
I don't think anyone in their right
mind would be comfortable

407
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,040
with the idea of someone getting worse
medical care because race or sex.

408
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,720
Given that we all agree on that,
what can be done here ?

409
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,120
Ideally, we'd simply figure out a way
for no one to ever get sick again,

410
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,560
thus making trips to the doctor
an embarrassment of the past,

411
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,560
like VCR's, or MTV giving out
something called

412
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,240
the "Michael Jackson Video
Vanguard Award."

413
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,600
2019 ?
They're still doing that ?

414
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,680
Is that a different Michael Jackson ?
It must be, right ?

415
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,280
Why drag Missy Elliot
into this shit ?

416
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,240
There are also concrete measures
the medical community can take.

417
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,840
Standardizing care
is a good first step.

418
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,680
Since 2006, California has cut its rate
of women dying in childbirth

419
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,560
by more than half, instituting
protocols for maternal care.

420
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,120
Some hospitals there now do
things like quantifying blood loss

421
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,600
by gathering the sponges and pads
and weighing them on a scale.

422
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,080
The doctor's potential
biases are removed from the equation,

423
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,600
'cause if a patient is bleeding too
much, the scale will say so.

424
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,120
That is just one example
to address one very specific problem.

425
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,840
We need to think much bigger.

426
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,280
I am just not the best vehicle
for this message.

427
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,560
We need someone who can speak
with authority from real experience

428
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,920
and luckily I know just the person...

429
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,440
Please welcome Wanda Sykes.

430
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,520
Wanda, I've got to say...

431
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,840
Exactly, Wanda...

432
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,760
- I'm so, so glad that you're here.
- I bet you are.

433
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,040
I was worried I might be a bit too
white to give advice on this subject.

434
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,800
That's because you are.
You're real white.

435
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,480
I bet you clap on the one
and the three, don't you ?

436
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,000
I wouldn't know how else to do it.
Yeah.

437
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,040
So, you're just
gonna have me stand here ?

438
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,360
- Would you rather...
- Yeah, I would.

439
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,520
- Okay ! Sure. Please.
- You get to sit. Let me sit.

440
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,840
Should I just crouch then ?

441
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,560
- You can go.
- I could go. Okay, all right. Sure.

442
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,440
Thank you.

443
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:12,440
Hello and welcome to "Last Sad
Tonight With Spectacles McDorky."

444
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,640
If you're a woman or a person of color,
going to the doctor can be rough.

445
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,080
Been there, done that,
got the ibu-fucking-profen !

446
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,640
But there's some things
we can do.

447
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,640
First, doctors and med students
should get bias training.

448
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,240
I know that doesn't sound like fun.
But it's one of those things

449
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,880
that's not fun,
but you should do it anyway,

450
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,960
like reading with your kids.

451
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:46,920
Trust me, you don't want to hear
your child has a reading problem

452
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,240
and it's you.

453
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,080
Second, we need more diversity
in the medical field.

454
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,240
We need more non-white doctors
in actual hospitals,

455
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,000
not just the ones
made up by Shonda Rhimes.

456
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,160
And finally, until we do
those first two things,

457
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,520
you've got to advocate for yourself.

458
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,120
And if that doesn't work, don't worry.
I've got a backup plan:

459
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,920
it's called "bring a white man".

460
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,200
If your doctor's ignoring you,

461
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,480
just bring a white man
to repeat everything you said.

462
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:34,680
If you're thinking: "Where the fuck
am I gonna find one of those ?"

463
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,400
Don't worry ! I've got a white friend
who loves complaining to doctors

464
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,200
and he's recorded some messages
you can use.

465
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,640
So, let's say you're having a heart
attack and they're not listening.

466
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,960
Just take out your phone
and show your doctor this.

467
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,480
You know what ? I'm having
a heart attack, but it's not like...

468
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:00,000
It's a lady heart attack.
I'm having a lady heart attack !

469
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,680
They're not sending
that man home !

470
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:15,240
They're giving him an EKG,
an MRI, and a BLT if he asks for it !

471
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,080
It's not just heart attacks.

472
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,280
I got Larry to record messages
for every occasion.

473
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,400
My elbow hurts when I do this !
Like a whipping motion.

474
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,040
My knee ! I can't bend it.
I can not squat.

475
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,480
My uterus is killing me.
I've got some pesky hormones today.

476
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,320
Shouldn't have to say this but,

477
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,360
my skin thickness is pretty much
the same as everybody else's.

478
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,400
It's hard for me to explain
what's going on with my ass,

479
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,840
but I'm gonna tell you
something: it hurts.

480
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,960
Side to side and the crack.

481
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:57,160
I don't know if it's coming from
the crack and that's why the sides hurt

482
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,760
or if it's coming from the sides
and that's why the crack hurts.

483
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,040
I can't go swimming.
I've got the curse.

484
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:15,120
You can find all of those and more
at "WhatsLarrysProblem.com."

485
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,800
That is so great, Wanda.

486
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,440
Let me just ask quickly:
what if a doctor still ignores you ?

487
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:26,200
