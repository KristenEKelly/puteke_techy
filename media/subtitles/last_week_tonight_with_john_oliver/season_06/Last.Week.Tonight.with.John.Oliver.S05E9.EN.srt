LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,090
SEASON VI
EPISODE 9

3
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,130
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,140
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,090
We begin with
the major news of the week,

6
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,070
the release
of one man's painstaking work

7
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,130
and the impact
it may have on history.

8
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,000
It's Queen Elizabeth's
93rd birthday today

9
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,200
and that guy nailed it.

10
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,050
There was one other
major story this week,

11
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,090
concerning the latest installment
in the "Stupid Watergate".

12
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,210
Watergate, if Nixon had been
kicked in the head by a billy goat

13
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:14,070
and if that billy goat had been
the White House chief of staff.

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,120
On Thursday, the Mueller report
was finally released.

15
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,140
It was over 400 pages long
and many in the media chose

16
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,090
to make a feature
of processing it in plain sight.

17
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,190
MSNBC had Ari Melber reading it
in the corner of the studio,

18
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,230
as if relegated to the kid's table,
while New York 1 aired

19
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:35,020
30 seconds of their printer getting
ready to print the report out.

20
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:40,110
Once the report had been read it
became clear there was a lot in it.

21
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:44,140
Mueller confirmed that Russia
interfered in our election,

22
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:49,120
but did not conclude that the Trump
team engaged in a criminal conspiracy.

23
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,200
Several actions by the president
were investigated

24
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,080
as potentially
obstruction of justice.

25
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,000
Mueller's team says: "If we had
confidence that the President"

26
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,150
"did not commit obstruction of justice,
we would so state."

27
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,720
Last one is a conspicuous
non-exoneration.

28
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,810
If you were interviewing a job
applicant and they told you:

29
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,690
"I wasn't found guilty
of fucking my neighbors' mailboxes,"

30
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,730
"but I also
wasn't found innocent."

31
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,800
You would not necessarily
rule them out,

32
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,640
but you'd think twice
about hiring them.

33
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,760
Some of the details
in this report were incredible.

34
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,650
When Trump learned that
Robert Mueller was appointed,

35
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,710
he slumped back in his chair
and said:

36
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,740
"This is terrible. This is the end
of my presidency. I'm f'...d.'"

37
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,610
Fucked.
He said: "I'm fucked."

38
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,840
While we don't know whether
Trump will face repercussions,

39
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,820
I'd like to live a little longer
in the moment of him saying:

40
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,840
"This is the end of my
presidency, I'm fucked."

41
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,750
I'll take artistic license
to fully paint that scene for you:

42
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,720
Trump, upon learning Mueller
was appointed, slumping in his chair,

43
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:03,680
Ivanka playing fetch with Don Jr.,
Eric's tongue is stuck to a flagpole,

44
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,030
Priebus is walking around with
his head inside a honey pot,

45
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,150
Jared is standing
in front of a blank wall,

46
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,940
Bannon is stress-eating
a bowl of used syringes

47
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,980
and Stephen Miller
is pulling the legs off a spider,

48
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,010
while Trump says those words,
as tears roll down:

49
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,960
"This is the end of my presidency.
I'm fucked."

50
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,110
At that moment, a pigeon flies
in and shits in his mouth.

51
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,060
It is a masterpiece.

52
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,920
I'm not saying
that's what happened,

53
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,060
we don't definitively know
that it didn't.

54
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:42,130
We can't cover everything
in the report tonight.

55
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,000
I'd like to concentrate
on two key factors

56
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,990
that may've saved the president:

57
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,000
incompetence when it comes
to conspiracy with Russia

58
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,090
and disobedience when it
comes to obstruction of justice.

59
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,970
Let's start with incompetence.
Meaning, with Michael Cohen.

60
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:01,050
The report spells out that Cohen
was in contact with Russians,

61
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,930
mostly concerning Trump's efforts
to build a tower in Moscow.

62
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,150
Which, in and of itself
is wildly inappropriate.

63
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,070
It is compromising for a candidate

64
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,080
to be asking business favors
of a hostile foreign government.

65
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,200
But from the very beginning,
Cohen was laughably inept.

66
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,050
He reached out to Putin's press
spokesman, Dmitry Peskov,

67
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,960
but couldn't get through.

68
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,110
That's because he meant to e-mail
"PR-peskova-at-prpress-dot-gov."

69
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:33,100
But actually e-mailed "dot-gof"
instead. And "dot-gof",

70
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,100
sends you right to the server for the
new HBO series "Game of Flounder",

71
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,030
where powerful flounder families
fight for control of the 7 sandbars.

72
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,170
It starts in June.
This network is fucked.

73
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:52,050
Another case of Cohen bungling
contact with Russians involved

74
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,080
Dmitry Klokov, a former press
secretary to Russia's energy minister.

75
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,080
Klokov's ex-wife contacted Ivanka,
offering assistance to the campaign.

76
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,140
That is someone with ties
to the Russian government,

77
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,170
offering help to elect Trump.

78
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,920
Ivanka forwarded that e-mail to Cohen,
who Googled "Dmitry Klokov"

79
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,010
and concluded they must be talking
about a former Olympic weightlifter,

80
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,040
a man who has
videos online like this.

81
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:32,910
Cohen saw that and thought:
"I got the right Dmitry Klokov."

82
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,880
Apparently, Russia's energy minister's
press secretary is jacked!

83
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,800
And good for you, bra,
hustle for that muscle.

84
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,830
Sore today, strong tomorrow.
Get swole, feed the soul.

85
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,940
From one beef tower
to another: respect.

86
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:54,030
The real Klokov kept trying to set
up a meeting between Trump and Putin,

87
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,920
but Cohen blew that proposal off,
which may not be surprising,

88
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:04,040
given that Cohen still appeared to
believe that the Klokov he spoke with

89
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,010
was the Olympic weightlifter.

90
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,910
Of course he was confused,
he was trying to figure out

91
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,930
why deceased German ice hockey
goalie Robert Mueller

92
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,870
wanted to speak with him.

93
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,830
It wasn't just Cohen.
The report found multiple instances

94
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,830
where people tied to the Russian
government offered Trump assistance

95
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,830
and, in some instances,
the Campaign was receptive.

96
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,850
But the thing that seemed
to stop closer coordination

97
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,800
was cartoonish levels of
disorganization and incompetence.

98
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,910
There were times when the Trump
team's ignorance of basic concepts

99
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,850
seems to have helped shield them
from criminal liability,

100
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,000
most notably when it came to
the infamous Trump Tower meeting,

101
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,040
featuring Don Jr., Jared, Paul Manafort
and a Russian offering more dirt.

102
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,970
Mueller's team concluded it would
unlikely be able to prove beyond doubt

103
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,910
that the participants had knowledge
their conduct was unlawful.

104
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,800
That kind of makes sense!
It is gonna be hard to prove

105
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,800
that this guy had knowledge that his
conduct could be breaking the law

106
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,810
or that he had knowledge
of anything at all,

107
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,020
other than what it feels like
to watch flags get more hugs

108
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,840
from your dad than you'd get
if you lived to be a thousand.

109
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,900
When it comes to conspiracy,

110
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,870
despite Russians wanting to help,

111
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,870
everyone around him was too
inept to work with them.

112
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,020
So, as for the other major question,
obstruction of justice,

113
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,880
Trump's saving grace
may've been that,

114
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,860
despite ample evidence
that he tried to do it,

115
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,860
everyone around him
was too disobedient to listen.

116
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,900
The report paints a remarkable
portrait of the president as a man

117
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,000
obsessed with
the Russia investigation,

118
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,990
trying to seize control of the inquiry
through his White House aides.

119
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,980
It highlights at least ten current
and former officials or associates

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,960
who did not carry out his orders.

121
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,970
The news that the president ordered
subordinates to do things

122
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,910
that might constitute obstruction
and then they just ignored him,

123
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,810
is both reassuring
and also terrifying.

124
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,960
That's like your spouse saying:

125
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,930
"Don't worry about the snake,
the baby killed it."

126
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,070
I'm glad the snake is dead,

127
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,020
but that means there was
a fucking snake in there.

128
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,070
And it also means our baby
has snake killing strength.

129
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,030
There's a lot to process here.
I'm happy, I'm relieved,

130
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,880
but I'm also angry
and confused.

131
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,870
Multiple instances of people
ignoring president's instructions.

132
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,920
When Trump asked Corey Lewandowski
to send his attorney general a message.

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,970
The president gave him orders
to tell the attorney general, Sessions,

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,960
to curtail the scope
of the Russia investigation.

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,010
Lewandowski
never followed through on it,

136
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:55,850
pass it to another aide who did also
not follow through on that.

137
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,850
That's a chain of two people
failing to follow through

138
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,080
on a demand
from the president.

139
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,980
That aide then passed
Trump's order off to an assistant,

140
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,020
who opened the window and
shouted it to a groundskeeper,

141
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,870
who wrote it down and taped it
to a Roomba that was passing by,

142
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,980
which drove itself
into the river,

143
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,150
because this isn't why
it got into government.

144
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,980
The most shocking example
of the president being ignored

145
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,180
involved former White House
Counsel Don McGahn.

146
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,970
Trump called and directed him to have
Mueller removed as special counsel.

147
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,120
McGahn refused, but Trump kept
pushing, until this happened.

148
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,970
Instead of carrying out Trump's
request, McGahn decided he would quit.

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,180
He called his lawyer, drove to
the White House, packed up his office,

150
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,090
prepared to submit a resignation
letter with his chief of staff,

151
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:47,130
told Reince Priebus that the president
has asked him to 'do crazy blank.'

152
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,120
Informed Priebus
and Bannon that he was leaving.

153
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,990
Holy fucking blank.

154
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:58,010
Preparing to quit because you're being
asked to do "crazy shit"

155
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,000
isn't what you expect
from the White House Counsel,

156
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:04,150
it's what you expect from
Nicolas Cage's personal assistant.

157
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,050
No, Nicolas, I'm not constructing
a ten-foot voodoo doll of you

158
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,110
out of rare gemstones
and dead crows.

159
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:15,180
I have a master's degree.
This is crazy shit, Nicolas.

160
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,030
You might take some reassurance
from the fact

161
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,080
that so many of the people in
Trump's orbit did not do as he asked.

162
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,070
But the worrying thing is, lots
of those people are gone now

163
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,010
and the newer figures seem
on the same page as the president.

164
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,010
Look at how the report was released.
Not only did William Barr,

165
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,980
downplay its contents in his
letter summarizing it to Congress,

166
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,980
but he gave a preemptive press
conference to spin report's contents,

167
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:48,980
repeating Trump's favorite phrase
"no collusion" and making excuses.

168
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,050
As the special counsel's
report acknowledges,

169
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,980
there is substantial evidence
to show that the president

170
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,930
was frustrated and
angered by his sincere belief

171
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,070
that the investigation
was undermining his presidency,

172
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:08,890
propelled by his political opponents
and fueled by illegal leaks.

173
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:14,980
Donald Trump has never once been
motivated by a "sincere belief".

174
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,900
He's motivated by two things only, one:
the icy howling winds

175
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,930
swirling in the yawning chasm of pitch
blackness where his soul should be.

176
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,980
And the hopeless pursuit of
the only woman he truly loves.

177
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:31,000
When you look at his presidency
this way, it's actually quite romantic.

178
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,040
If I may quote the advice
Alec Baldwin's attorney gives:

179
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,940
"Being angry is not the same
thing as being innocent."

180
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,070
That wasn't the only thing
that Barr said that,

181
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,970
in the wake of reading the report,
seems laughably and misleading.

182
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,870
The White House fully cooperated
with the counsel's investigation.

183
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,070
The president took no act that
in fact deprived the special counsel

184
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,910
of documents and witnesses necessary
to complete his investigation.

185
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:05,010
A gross mischaracterization
of what the report actually said.

186
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,000
"Full cooperation" would've involved
sitting down for an interview,

187
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,850
which Trump did not do.

188
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,020
Mueller not only found Trump's
written answers "inadequate",

189
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,990
he engaged in efforts to curtail
the Special Counsel's investigation

190
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,590
and prevent the disclosure
of evidence to it,

191
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,660
including through public and private
contacts with potential witnesses.

192
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,680
Which is the exact opposite
of what Barr said.

193
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,580
It's like Barr summarized
Twilight as:

194
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,590
"A girl in Florida goes
to third base with a Wookiee."

195
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,480
No, that's not what happens.

196
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,620
I'm not sure we're reading
the same underlying material.

197
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:44,510
I've read the real book, a dog-man
falls in love with a baby.

198
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,650
Respect the text.
Honor the written word.

199
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:53,620
All of this is clearly very depressing.
There's still so much we don't know.

200
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,650
There are significant
redactions within the report,

201
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,650
references to 14 investigations
Mueller handed to other prosecutors,

202
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,610
twelve of which remain secret.

203
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,610
And that can make this
feel a little anticlimactic,

204
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,680
ever since Barr's
summary came out,

205
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,600
Trump administration's been
taking an un-earned victory lap.

206
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,600
The idea that any of us,
and me as a campaign manager,

207
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:20,480
would cheat, steal, lie, cut corners,
talk to Russians, was an insult.

208
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:25,770
But was it, though?
An insult would be to say that

209
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:29,600
Conway died many years ago
and is a skin suit occupied

210
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,760
by 300 rats
who have evolved the ability to lie.

211
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,740
That's what an insult is.
A fact, however...

212
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:42,670
The Mueller report explicitly shows
Trump and his associates doing

213
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,690
many of the things
she just listed.

214
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:51,610
The report vindicates administration
on their own false premises.

215
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,830
We pointed out that Trump
and his team were trying

216
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,650
to center the narrative
on "collusion",

217
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,720
despite the fact that the term
has no specific legal meaning.

218
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,600
By reframing
the investigation that way,

219
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,670
Trump ensured that anything
short of Mueller publishing

220
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:10,720
400 pages of text messages between
him and Putin gaming out election fraud

221
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,680
meant the whole thing
was a complete waste of time.

222
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,790
Mueller's report did not find collusion
and wasn't trying to

223
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,660
because that word
doesn't even apply here.

224
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,710
And it didn't establish that Trump's
team was part of a criminal conspiracy

225
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,280
to interfere with the election.

226
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,080
But it found
a lot of other stuff.

227
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,090
Consider what we learned,
or had confirmed, this week:

228
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:36,120
Russia interfered in our election
and made efforts to help Trump win.

229
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,190
While his campaign did not
provably cooperate with Russia,

230
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:44,260
they seemed eager
to accept their help.

231
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,150
Trump may have obstructed justice
and if he didn't,

232
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:52,100
it might only be because people who
work for him ignored his orders.

233
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,250
The attorney general, the nation's
top law-enforcement official,

234
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,230
has proven himself
to be a dishonest hack.

235
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,260
I'm not saying that
any of that is good news.

236
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:06,050
But it is definitely good
that we know about it.

237
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,270
Having the knowledge
that the Mueller report provides

238
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,160
is infinitely better
than the alternative.

239
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,220
'Cause that knowledge can
inform Congress going forward

240
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,260
and voters
a year and a half from now.

241
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:22,060
The alternative is for America
to end up like Michael Cohen:

242
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,230
confused, easily manipulated
and never fully understanding

243
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,990
how a guy with a fulltime job
as a press secretary

244
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,870
can also be such a max-jacked
certifiable meat king.

245
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,990
And now this.

246
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:40,040
And Now, In Honor of Easter:
Fuck You, Peeps.

247
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:45,840
If you love the Easter marshmallow
treat Peeps, you'll love this story.

248
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,890
I hate 'em.

249
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,890
Everybody hates Peeps!

250
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,030
- Do you like regular Peeps?
- No. I would rather eat dirt.

251
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,960
Fuck yeah! Dirt rules!
Peeps suck!

252
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,010
Peeps are like the candy corn
around Halloween.

253
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,980
You either love 'em or you don't,
like some people.

254
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,820
We'll tell you about where you can
put or shove those Peeps.

255
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,920
Hear that, America?
You can take your Peep

256
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,860
and shove it all the way
up your actual asshole!

257
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:17,820
I posted this to Facebook last week.
Marshmallow Peeps coffee creamer.

258
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,890
No!

259
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,830
- Where do you think Peeps is?
- It's not on the list, it's gross.

260
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,860
- Not a fan of marshmallows?
- Not a fan of Peeps.

261
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,020
The news lady is correct!
Peeps are gross!

262
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,910
We continue talking about it
like they're really popular

263
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,000
but
everybody I talk to is not a fan.

264
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:44,860
That's right, Peep fans!
You don't exist!

265
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,990
Moving on. With all
the talk of the Mueller report,

266
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,920
we thought it might be nice to end
on the exact opposite of that.

267
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,850
To do that, we turn to Japan:
the country that gave us Pokémon,

268
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,960
and... my God,
it's a Jigglypuff!

269
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,000
I've never seen one of these
in the wild before!

270
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,880
Take out a Poké Ball
and slowly and carefully throw it.

271
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:09,990
You ready? And...

272
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,890
Throw! Throw it!

273
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:19,010
God! You threw it too hard!
You killed Jigglypuff!

274
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,830
Jigglypuff is dead now.
Why did you throw it so hard?

275
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,850
Where was I?
That's right: Japan.

276
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,980
There is something amazing
happening over there now.

277
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,910
Japan is home
to thousands of mascots,

278
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,960
from museums to prisons
to entire towns and cities.

279
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
We loved that idea so much
that we made our own mascots

280
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,880
for various U.S. government
agencies.

281
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:50,810
We are not the only ones who've
decided to make some mascots.

282
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:56,810
A rogue mascot is causing
controversy in one Japanese city.

283
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,980
Meet Chiitan, the unsanctioned otter
mascot that is gaining popularity

284
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,030
on social media thanks
to its edgy personality.

285
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,000
Video of Chiitan swinging a weed
eater and you can see him there,

286
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,830
dancing on a pole...

287
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:15,800
Your eyes are not deceiving you:
that is video of a Japanese mascot

288
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,040
on a stripper pole, presumably
at a strip club called

289
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,970
"There Are Way More People Who Are
Into This Thing Than You Think."

290
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,860
It is my honor tonight
to introduce you to Chiitan.

291
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,870
You are gonna be glad that I did.
I know that he may look

292
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,240
like half a Vienna Finger that took
too much ecstasy in the '90s,

293
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:38,190
but Chiitan is a "0-year-old fairy baby
who plays around actively every day!"

294
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:42,230
Chiitan is a giant otter wearing
a turtle as a hat,

295
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,190
which is, incidentally, already
my favorite sentence of all time,

296
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:50,110
right next to "Welcome to
the John Oliver Koala Chlamydia Ward."

297
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:55,090
The story of what's going on with
Chiitan is a little complicated,

298
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,170
but in a nutshell: there's
a city in Japan called Susaki.

299
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,320
Susaki's official mascot
is Shinjo-kun,

300
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,230
a magnificent giant otter
wearing a ramen dish for a hat.

301
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,220
Excellent.

302
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,280
Until recently, the city also had
a honorary "tourism ambassador",

303
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,240
an actual otter named Chiitan.

304
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:17,190
Chiitan the actual otter has a mascot
otter and that is what Chiitan is.

305
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,250
There are three otters,
two of which are named "Chiitan"

306
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:24,210
and the mascot Chiitan was never
affiliated with the city of Susaki.

307
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,280
It's that simple.

308
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,250
The unofficial mascot Chiitan has been
producing some bizarre videos,

309
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:36,930
also this one where Chiitan
flips a car with its bare paws.

310
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,910
Susaki reportedly received
over 100 calls from around Japan

311
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,900
complaining about Chiitan,
and earlier this year,

312
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,850
the city attempted to distance
themselves from it

313
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,780
by declining to renew the real
Chiitan as its tourism ambassador.

314
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,790
City cut ties with the otter because
of the things the fake otter did.

315
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,800
Which is a real shame.
Chiitan has been a lot of fun,

316
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,840
its Twitter account
is full of crazy shit like this.

317
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:24,880
You might be wanting to ask:
"How does an umbrellawielding,"

318
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,890
"coked-up otter being assaulted
in a windowless room"

319
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,800
"encourage tourism to the small
Japanese port city of Susaki?"

320
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,150
I'm on TV and I'm talking about
the small Japanese port city of Susaki.

321
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,120
That should answer
your stupid fucking question.

322
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,020
Every Chiitan video
is a work of art.

323
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:46,090
Take this one, for example,
titled "With My Friends."

324
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,140
It's understandable to have
questions after watching that, like:

325
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,010
"What am I watching?
Who's that karate cat?"

326
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,050
and "Why is Chiitan
angry with that inflatable pole?"

327
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,160
"Am I bored?" is not one of
the questions you're asking there.

328
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,140
Violence is a theme with Chiitan.

329
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,110
Here is another video that starts
charming and then has a bit of a turn.

330
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,030
It is a testament to the utter
brilliance of that video

331
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,050
that I've watched it
dozens of times

332
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,150
and not once have I thought to
whether or not that person was okay.

333
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,950
It doesn't matter 'cause even if
they weren't, it was worth it.

334
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:44,000
As good as these videos are,
Chiitan is even better at Twitter,

335
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,850
with a virtuosic
deployment of memes.

336
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:51,050
"Hello birb"...
Hello Pulitzer Prize for Poetry!

337
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,950
Another magnificent example.
"Don't ever talk to my son"

338
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:59,980
"or my son's son or my son's
son's son's son ever again".

339
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:04,070
Try saying that without laughing.
It's physiologically impossible.

340
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,080
Asking me to pick a favorite
Chiitan tweet is like asking me

341
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:09,950
to pick a favorite son.

342
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,010
Or son's son.
It'd be difficult

343
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:16,040
but I'd probably have to say
this one, in which Chiitan,

344
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,990
standing next to a small kangaroo
asks: "Is this a pigeon?"

345
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:26,990
Clearly the question is rhetorical.
Chiitan is good at recognizing birbs.

346
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,980
When's the last time
Twitter made you happy?

347
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,920
When's the last time
anything made you happy?

348
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,040
I admit that Chiitan's
occasionally gone a bit too far,

349
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,870
like with this video titled
"Chiitan Is Going to Visit Your House."

350
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,780
Even the most generous interpretation
of that is that Chiitan

351
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,730
is gonna come to your house and
beat you to death with a baseball bat.

352
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,760
I do get why a city might
not want that message delivered

353
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,650
by an unofficial mascot.

354
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,820
But I am sorry
for Susaki that he's gone.

355
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:17,650
I'd also like you to spare a thought
for their official mascot, Shinjo-kun,

356
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,820
who is also, as we've established:
excellent.

357
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,730
Not as splashy as Chiitan,
but still wears a noodle-bowl for a hat

358
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,680
and that's not nothing, is it?

359
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,760
Shinjo-kun was overshadowed
by an psychotic otter.

360
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,830
While there's an element
of relief there for Shinjo-kun,

361
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:36,670
there's gonna be a massive,
Chiitan-shaped hole in its life.

362
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,000
The two mascots were together
a lot, and I have to say,

363
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,890
whever you see Shinjo-kun alone,
the obvious sadness there

364
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,970
is absolutely heartbreaking.

365
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:49,810
It's clear that Shinjo-kun
needs a new friend,

366
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:53,860
one that won't disappear or threaten
the citizens with a baseball bat.

367
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:58,800
Luckily, anyone can make an unofficial
mascot for a city in Japan.

368
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,760
If you don't already know
where this is heading,

369
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,800
you've clearly never watched
this fucking show before.

370
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,970
Of course we made our own mascot.
Please meet Chiijohn.

371
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,790
Chiijohn is a 41-year-old
nearsighted English fairy baby.

372
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,870
When there's a new mascot
on this show, I get up

373
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,920
and walk over there to introduce
you to him in person.

374
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,840
I can't actually introduce you
to Chiijohn in person tonight.

375
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,950
The reason I can't do that
is 'cause he's already in Japan.

376
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,810
It's true! Here he is having
the time of his life in Tokyo!

377
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,960
I know what you're thinking:
"I get it, John. You just created"

378
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,720
"a mascot to go to Japan
and fuck with people."

379
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,780
But no. You don't get it.
You don't get it at all.

380
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,630
We made Chiijohn with
the sole intention that he locate

381
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,590
and comfort Shinjo-kun, and fill
the hole Chiitan left in his heart.

382
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,750
And for a sense of whether
he was able to do that,

383
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,710
you should take a look at this.

384
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,560
The Journey of Chiijohn

385
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:09,680
After a long flight,
Chiijohn arrived in Tokyo.

386
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,580
He'd never seen
anything like it,

387
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,780
because he just
got glasses the day before.

388
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:27,650
Tomorrow he'd visit Susaki,
but tonight belonged to Tokyo.

389
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,700
Violently hungover, Chiijohn
got up the next morning.

390
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,800
And as he looked through
the clouds towards Susaki,

391
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,610
he remembered the reason
he was here: Shinjo-kun.

392
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:49,690
He was 100 percent sure they were
meant to be together

393
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,780
and 40 percent sure
he was looking at Susaki.

394
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,640
All the way to the train station,
Chiijohn's heart pounded.

395
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:02,600
Each step was a step
closer to his destiny.

396
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,690
After a while, he got tired
of steps and took a rickshaw.

397
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,630
Each step of his rickshaw driver
was a step closer to his destiny.

398
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,610
At last, Susaki.
Shinjo-kun was everywhere,

399
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:27,590
on the stairs, on the sidewalk,
on the walls and in the streets.

400
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:32,580
On his way, Chiijohn introduced
himself to all the local fish.

401
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,750
This is the path that falls
at Shinjo-kun's feet.

402
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:41,580
This is the breeze
that cools Shinjo-kun's face.

403
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,780
This is the sun that warms
the noodles that Shinjo-kun wears.

404
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,880
And knowing this
filled Chiijohn with joy.

405
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:57,720
The final steps to his
destiny were uphill.

406
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,810
Aren't they always?

407
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:06,790
Finally, Chiijohn saw Shinjo-kun,
his new best friend.

408
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:13,720
Shinjo-kun didn't know
if he was ready for a new best friend.

409
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:20,680
He had had a best friend, Chiitan.
And it had been a living nightmare.

410
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,720
But Chiijohn seemed different,

411
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,810
less upper body strength,
for one thing.

412
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:32,710
At the local arcade, they used sticks
to whack moles, not each other.

413
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,800
Though they share
an appetite for destruction,

414
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,830
destroying something together
is an act of creation.

415
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:44,760
Shinjo-kun made Chiijohn happy.
And Chiijohn wanted Shinjo-kun

416
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:48,140
to have a Shinju-kun so Shinjo-kun
could be happy, too.

417
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:53,220
But Chiijohn couldn't get Shinjo-kun
a Shinjo-kun and this made them sad.

418
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,160
Sadness was another
thing they shared.

419
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,340
Chiijohn tried to cheer
Shinjo-kun up.

420
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,340
He put on Shinjo-kun's
thinking cap.

421
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,240
Suddenly, he knew just
what to do:

422
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,320
introduce themselves
to some local fish.

423
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,320
Shinjo-kun taught Chiijohn how to
take one stick and make two sticks.

424
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,340
It was the best day of their lives.

425
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,360
Without the sadness
of the claw machine,

426
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,280
Shinjo-kun never would have
felt this joy.

427
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,180
If his old best friend hadn't left,

428
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,210
his new best friend never
would have come.

429
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,170
"That's too much soy sauce",
Shinjo-kun said.

430
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,310
"No," replied Chiijohn, "it's not
enough fish."

431
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:45,150
Shinjo-kun had found
his new best friend.

432
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,280
A little chaos fulfills the spirit

433
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:52,460
and prepares us
for all the claw machines ahead.

434
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,350
They saw their path and felt
their breeze and saw their sun.

435
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,370
"Where is our sun going?",
Chiijohn asked.

436
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,350
"Do not worry",
said Shinjo-kun,

437
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,290
"We'll have
our sun back tomorrow."

438
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,310
"And our sun's son.
And our sun's son's son."

439
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,240
"And our sun's son's son's son."

440
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,340
None of us thought this was
where our show was going tonight

441
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,240
and yet here we are now.

442
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,470
Chiijohn is still in Japan.

443
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,350
The City of Susaki have now
officially taken ownership of him.

444
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:40,390
If you ever want to see Chiijohn,
you'll simply have to go there.

445
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,390
That is our show. Thank you.
We're off next week. Good night!

446
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:50,020
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

447
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,840
END OF EPISODE 9,
SEASON VI
