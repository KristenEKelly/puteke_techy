00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,320
LAST WEEK TONIGHT WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,880
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight" !

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,760
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

4
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,480
Just time for a quick
recap of the week,

5
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,960
and unfortunately,
we have to begin in South Carolina,

6
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,080
where, on Wednesday,
nine people were tragically killed

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,240
at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church
in Charleston.

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,360
It was yet another senseless,
horrific act of violence,

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,320
and even the president seemed tired
of this depressingly familiar routine.

10
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,040
Now is the time for mourning
and for healing.

11
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,440
But let's be clear.

12
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,040
At some point, we as a country

13
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,480
will have to reckon with the fact
that this type of mass violence

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,360
does not happen
in other advanced countries,

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,480
and it is in our power
to do something about it.

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,960
I say that, recognizing
the politics in this town...

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,920
foreclose...
a lot of those avenues right now.

18
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,680
And at some point,
it's gonna be important

19
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,760
for the American people
to come to grips with it.

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,560
He sounds completely defeated,
which is understandable.

21
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,800
He's made more than a dozen statements

22
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,200
about mass shootings
in his presidency so far,

23
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,000
and nothing has been done.

24
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,480
But it's still hard
not to feel disillusioned

25
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,960
watching the most
powerful man in the world

26
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,480
sound so hopeless.

27
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,600
It's like seeing your father cry
for the first time,

28
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,160
or catching a department store Santa
getting into his Toyota Tercel.

29
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,000
Or seeing your high school English
teacher at the grocery store

30
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,480
with a shopping cart full
of 14 Lean Cuisine lasagnas.

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,480
Oh, Mr. Greenblatt,
are those all for you ?

32
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,480
You taught us to be courageous,
but you won't even try eHarmony.

33
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,040
This is devastating.

34
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,360
I'm devastated, Mr. G.

35
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,040
Look, it is pretty clear
nothing is going to be done

36
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,280
about how this tragedy was committed,

37
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,760
which might explain
why some are focused

38
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,480
on a symbol associated
with why it happened.

39
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,480
Because in the wake of this
racially motivated shooting,

40
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,440
some people found
one thing especially galling.

41
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,600
The American, the state flag
those are at half-staff.

42
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,760
The Confederate flag
that has not been lowered at all.

43
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,480
That's right,
the Confederate battle flag

44
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,480
was flying at full staff
in front of the state capitol,

45
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,120
although perhaps the bigger question is
why it was flying at any staff at all.

46
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,560
The Confederate flag is one of those
symbols that should really only be seen

47
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,840
on T-shirts, belt buckles,
and bumper stickers

48
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,440
to help the rest of us identify
the worst people in the world.

49
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,720
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that a...

50
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,040
Is that a Confederate flag
on your belt, LeAnn ?

51
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,360
Thanks for coming in. The nanny
position has already been filled.

52
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,840
Which is not to say
the flag does not have

53
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,160
passionate defenders in South Carolina,

54
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,920
and that may be why politicians there
go through comical contortions

55
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,640
to avoid criticizing it.

56
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,040
Is it time to stop flying
the Confederate flag ?

57
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,440
Well, at the end of the day,
it's time for people in South Carolina

58
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,960
to revisit that decision
would be fine with me,

59
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,680
but this is part of who we are.

60
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,760
The flag represents, to some people,

61
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,160
a civil war, and that was
the symbol of one side.

62
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,800
To others, it's a racist symbol,

63
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,920
and it's been used by people
it's been used in a racist way.

64
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,200
Yeah. Yeah, it has.
In fact, I believe the first time

65
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,560
the Confederate flag was
"used" in a racist way

66
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,080
was the exact second they finished
sewing the very first one.

67
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
It was around that time.

68
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,760
Now, to be somewhat fair here lowering
the flag outside the state capitol

69
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,560
is a little more difficult
than it sounds.

70
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,920
The flag cannot
be lowered for any reason,

71
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,440
because it is affixed to that pole.
It can't be raised or lowered.

72
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,640
And if that flag is to be removed
or lowered or anything done to it,

73
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,320
you have to get I think
it's two-thirds majority vote

74
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,720
in each chamber of
the state assembly to do it.

75
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,240
Yeah. It needs a two-thirds vote.

76
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,440
They were originally going
to make it three-fifths,

77
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,080
but even they thought that might be
just a bit on the nose.

78
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,440
Now, look. Look, South Carolina,

79
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,840
and, indeed,
any state that flies this flag

80
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,760
even as part of their actual
state flag, Mississippi !

81
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,000
Holy shit !

82
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,840
Now might be a great time

83
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,000
out of respect not just
for the events of this week,

84
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,760
but for the events
of the past several centuries

85
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,880
to take that vote
and lower that flag down to half-staff.

86
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,400
And then, when it's at half-staff,

87
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,280
why not keep lowering it
all the way down,

88
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,880
and once you're
holding it in your hands,

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,720
take it off the flagpole completely,
fold it

90
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,280
or don't bother
put it in a box, label it "bad flag,"

91
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,720
and put it somewhere no one can see it.

92
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,240
Just a thought.
It's just, just a simple, good thought.

93
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,960
Let's... move on now to Russia,

94
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,200
a country that will continue
to be funny until it suddenly isn't.

95
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,280
With summer here,

96
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,280
you may be wondering where to take
your family on vacation ?

97
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,520
Well, on Tuesday,
Russia unveiled a brand-new option.

98
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,840
It's called Patriot Park.

99
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,240
and when it's finished,
it's set to become

100
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,200
a kind of Russian military Disneyland,

101
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,600
where children can clamber
over heavy weaponry,

102
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,520
even play with grenade launchers

103
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,200
instead of riding on the normal kind
of fairground attractions.

104
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,040
Okay. Okay. Okay.

105
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,600
As an adult, I'm horrified,

106
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,720
but as a former child,
I'm incredibly jealous

107
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,960
that theme parks now exist

108
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,160
where you can play
with grenade launchers.

109
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,480
British children just got taken to
P.G. Wodehouse's Faux Pas Mansion.

110
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,280
It didn't have rides so much
as a selection of chairs.

111
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,000
Russia's Patriot Park
is actually due to open in 2017,

112
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,320
but they've released an
early promotional video for it,

113
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,280
showing that every part of it
is designed

114
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,120
to celebrate the Russian military,

115
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,240
from the contents of the park
to how you get there.

116
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,560
It can be reached by bus
from the metro stop Park Pobedy,

117
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,840
by train from Belorussky
Railway Station,

118
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,600
or by car by taking
the 55th exit off the Minsk Highway.

119
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,280
The exit is made out of two large
demountable transport bridges

120
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,320
as used by the Russian military.

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That's right.

122
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,680
Even the highway exit
to the park is "on theme."

123
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,040
That may be taking things
a bit too far.

124
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,200
Even SeaWorld doesn't make you enter
by driving over a tortured orca,

125
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,000
and SeaWorld loves torturing orcas.

126
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,480
They love it so much !

127
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,600
Russia is spending
an estimated $370 million on this park,

128
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,560
which might sound like a lot
for a country currently suffering

129
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,080
under international sanctions
and low oil prices.

130
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,640
But going by their video,

131
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,920
they're almost alarmingly
unconcerned about that.

132
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,280
More than 500 examples
of military equipment

133
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,640
will be on display in a special
100,000 square-meter open space area.

134
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,760
Do you see that ?

135
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,280
There is going to be
an area literally called

136
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,600
the "Military Industrial Complex."

137
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,920
And sure, sure, you can argue that
Eisenhower saw this coming,

138
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,280
but I don't recall him
mentioning in his speech

139
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,480
anything about it,
one day, getting so big,

140
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,920
that Russian kids could
physically walk through it,

141
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,640
eating a fucking churro.

142
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,400
Finally this week money.

143
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,000
It turns out if you offer
Robert De Niro enough of it,

144
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,280
he'll appear in "The Adventures
of Rocky & Bullwinkle."

145
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,040
This week brought a very exciting
development in US currency.

146
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,920
The $10 bill is being redesigned

147
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,840
and it will feature the first woman
on the nations' paper currency

148
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,120
in more than a century.

149
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,000
Great. That feels... Why not ?

150
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,600
That feels like progress...

151
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,680
of the embarrassingly late kind.

152
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,960
It's kind of like when
a company announces

153
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,160
their first female vice president.
It makes you think, "Really ? Okay.

154
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,240
"Well, congratulations on finally doing
the second-least you could do."

155
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,960
And even in this instance, it turns out
campaigners had been hoping,

156
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,480
for something a little more.

157
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,360
The pick of the $10 bill
is a bit of a surprise.

158
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,960
Over the last several months,

159
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,280
a campaign to put a woman
on the $20 bill went viral.

160
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,080
Yeah, of course they wanted the 20.

161
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,480
The 20 is a much better bill to be on.

162
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,640
The only person in America who
regularly uses the 10 is Richard Gere,

163
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,720
and that's only to show his hair
stylist the look that he's going for.

164
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,280
A look that he has nailed.
He has nailed it.

165
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,600
Treasury Secretary Jack Lew
was actually asked

166
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,600
why women had only been offered the 10,

167
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,360
and he responded
in magnificently awkward fashion.

168
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,280
What would you say to people who say

169
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,080
"The 10, it's not as
prestigious as the $20 bill."

170
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,880
"You can't get that at every ATM."

171
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,120
I think the $10 bill
is a pretty big deal.

172
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,200
But it's not the 20.

173
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,240
You know, I think the $10 bill is
one of our most widely used bills,

174
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,840
and... it is, I think,

175
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,200
as important as the 20.

176
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,680
Bullshit, it's as important as the 20 !
Bullshit !

177
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,720
That's the equivalent
of claiming Liam Hemsworth

178
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,080
is as important as Chris Hemsworth.

179
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,600
You're fooling yourself !

180
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,080
Liam's useful, sure.
He'll do you in a pinch,

181
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,480
but he's exactly half as good as Chris.

182
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,720
End of discussion.
#HALFAHEMSWORRTH

183
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,280
End of discussion.

184
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,560
And the crazy thing is,

185
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,400
it actually makes much more sense
to kick Andrew Jackson off the 20

186
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,120
than Alexander Hamilton off the 10.

187
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,720
Hamilton was America's
first Treasury Secretary.

188
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,600
He proposed setting up both a
national bank and a national mint.

189
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,280
Andrew Jackson
didn't even trust paper money.

190
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,720
Jackson took a kind of fundamentalist
view of money and credit.

191
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,760
Gold and silver dollars
were real money.

192
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,400
Paper was, in some sense, fake.

193
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,280
That's true.
Andrew Jackson hated paper money,

194
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,000
and yet we've stamped
his face all over it.

195
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,000
It would be like having
Guy Fieri branded quinoa,

196
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,200
or putting Tom Cruise's face
on an antidepressant ad.

197
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,280
That would make him furious,
and you don't want that.

198
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,600
He's OT level 16.
He can move objects with his mind.

199
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,200
He could do it.

200
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,160
But, the thing is, in an amazing twist,
it turns out Hamilton

201
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,400
won't be completely shut out
of the $10 bill after all.

202
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,520
If you're a big fan of Alexander
Hamilton, don't despair.

203
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,360
The Treasury Department says
that his image will remain in some way

204
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,120
on at least some of the $10 bills.

205
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,360
Oh, so a woman's not
getting her own bill at all !

206
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,040
She'll be splitting it
with Alexander Hamilton.

207
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,920
This is the perfect embodiment
of the Women's Rights Movement.

208
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,680
Women ask for something they've earned,

209
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,880
a bunch of men get together
and talk about it,

210
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,920
and then they give the women half
and ask her to share it.

211
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,200
And now, this.

212
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,960
And now, C-Span callers suggest women
for the $10 bill.

213
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,440
We want to know what you think.
Who should be on the $10 bill ?

214
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,760
It should be the Blessed Virgin Mary,

215
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,960
which everybody on the Earth
knows her picture.

216
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,480
Yeah, Ayn Rand.

217
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,080
If this country ever does make it, we
owe a great debt of gratitude to her.

218
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,320
The best of the lot, I'm gonna tell ya,
Amelia Earhart.

219
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,480
A lot of people think
she was executed by the Japanese

220
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,560
in the South Pacific. Nobody knows.

221
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,800
Sally Ride, Sacajawea,

222
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,720
Eleanor Roosevelt, Harriet Tubs.

223
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:47,080
I'd rather see a wolf,
a bear, a cougar, an eagle.

224
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,200
I think it should be Princess Diana.

225
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,720
Princess Diana ?

226
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,880
So, someone who is not American ?

227
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,160
Well, I still think
she ought to be on there.

228
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,720
Moving on.

229
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,400
Our main story tonight
concerns the Internet.

230
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,600
It's a place where you can see
incredible things,

231
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,280
like glamor shots of cats,

232
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,280
Angora show bunnies,

233
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,640
or even this rare,
heartbreaking footage

234
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,720
of an injured World War I soldier
returning home to his pregnant wife.

235
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,400
You idiots ! I got you so good !
I got you so good !

236
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,680
The Internet has been blowing our minds

237
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,040
with its power and convenience
for decades,

238
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,480
as you can see in this actual AOL
ad from the '90s.

239
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,080
Hey, Dan, ready for the game ?

240
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,280
I'm just finishing up here
with my new kayaking friends.

241
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,840
- Kayaking friends on your computer ?
- Yeah, I just got America Online.

242
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,960
Sounds great.
Listen, I can't go to the game today.

243
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
What ?

244
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,360
I've got to send something for
my mom's birthday. It's tomorrow.

245
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,480
Then book plane tickets
for our trip next week,

246
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,480
and my kid's gotta go to the library
to look up dinosaurs.

247
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,520
Hey, we can take care
of all of that before we go.

248
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,000
- Yeah, right.
- With America Online.

249
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,360
Wait. Let me get this right.

250
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,160
Your mum's birthday is tomorrow,
your trip is next week,

251
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
and you're only planning
both of those things now ?

252
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,880
Forget the AOL tutorial.

253
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,280
Let's talk about basic responsibility
here, Dan. You're a father !

254
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,880
But as the ad goes on to point out,

255
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,560
the Internet was
going to fix everything.

256
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,240
Call now for 10 free hours
of America Online,

257
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,200
and get instant access
to the worlds of sports, finance,

258
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,440
computing, and entertainment.

259
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,640
Here come the dinosaurs.
I saved you a trip to the library.

260
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,960
- That's great !
- Yeah, downloading's easy too.

261
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,160
You know, I can even
send email on the Internet.

262
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,280
Of course, there's
my personal favorite: live chat.

263
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,680
That's how I met
my new kayaking buddies.

264
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,760
Okay. Okay. Okay.

265
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm now pretty sure that
"kayaking buddies" is a euphemism.

266
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,040
I'm not saying that he's
not going to meet his new buddies

267
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,280
in a shed by a lake.

268
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,920
I'm just saying there's not going
to be a kayak involved. That's...

269
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,880
Amazingly, that ad was 20 years ago,

270
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,600
and the Internet has become integral
to modern life.

271
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,640
But, unfortunately, it's also
become a haven for harassment,

272
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,720
and I'm not talking about
everyday Internet abuse,

273
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,560
of which I am more than aware.

274
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,080
Look at our YouTube page
and you'll see comments like...

275
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,760
"This guy is a fucking dumbass !"

276
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,560
"I don't know why, but I always picture
John Oliver as a puffin."

277
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,760
And... "Watch his hands. His fingers
are like creepy spider legs."

278
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,920
Which is ridiculous, because

279
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,520
Oh God ! Oh ! Get off me !

280
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,240
No, I'm not talking about that.

281
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,440
I'm talking about
the kind of direct threats

282
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,920
that can make people
fear for their safety.

283
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,280
And if you're thinking, "Well, come on,

284
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
"that doesn't seem
like that big a problem."

285
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,280
Well, congratulations
on your white penis.

286
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,320
Because, if you have one of those,

287
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,520
you probably have a very different
experience of the Internet.

288
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,280
Women, in particular, can receive

289
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,840
a veritable cornucopia
of horrifying messages online.

290
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,040
Just listen to one female
video gamer discussing

291
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,560
one of the more colorful
threats that she's seen.

292
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,680
I think the one that always
sticks out in my mind is

293
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,120
"I'm going to stick an egg in
your vaginal canal and punch it."

294
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,720
I don't know why,
but that one is just... it's poignant.

295
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,360
You know what ? It is kind of poignant.
Fun fact for you.

296
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,280
"I'm going to stick an egg
in your vaginal canal and punch it"

297
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
was actually the original
title of "Eat Pray Love."

298
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,480
So, there's a little fact for ya.

299
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,840
And that threat was comparatively mild.

300
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,280
Others can be chillingly
specific and potentially dangerous.

301
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,960
Listen to how these women were treated

302
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,560
when they spoke out against
what they saw as sexism

303
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,160
in the video game industry.

304
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,680
I am constantly aware of the fact that

305
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,280
there is an enormous amount of hate
directed towards me.

306
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,360
Hate in the form
of bomb threats, rape threats,

307
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,680
even death threats.

308
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,560
They told me
they were coming to kill me.

309
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,200
When someone posts your address online,

310
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,960
and they tell you they're gonna murder
your whole family,

311
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,080
you don't really feel safe
staying at that location.

312
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,200
Yeah, no shit.

313
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,720
I wouldn't blame her for not
feeling safe staying on Earth.

314
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,480
For the record,
if someone did that to me,

315
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,640
I'd hitch a ride to the International
Space Station straight away.

316
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,640
Except who am I kidding ?
They'd never let me in.

317
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,200
I've got spiders for hands !
The Internet is mean !

318
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,680
And look, this does not just
affect women in gaming.

319
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,680
It can potentially affect any woman

320
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,280
who makes the mistake of having
a thought in her mind,

321
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,480
and then vocalizing it online.

322
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,840
For many female writers
and public figures,

323
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,120
this day-to-day harassment
is their life.

324
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,720
Earlier this year, writer Amanda Hess
detailed her experience.

325
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,960
The threats were obviously distressing

326
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,280
It was an anonymous person on Twitter
threatening to come to my house,

327
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,440
to rape me, to cut off my head.

328
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,800
And in case you think
she's exaggerating,

329
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,040
here are some of the
tweets she's referring to.

330
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,200
"Happy to say we live in
the same state. I'm looking you up,"

331
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,440
"and when I fiind you, I'm going to
rape you and remove your head."

332
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,520
And "I am 36 years old,
I did 12 years for 'manslaughter',"

333
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,480
"I killed a woman, like you,
who decided to make fun of guys cocks.

334
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,320
...which is horrifying
for so many reasons.

335
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,280
First, he put "manslaughter" in quotes,

336
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,440
like he still doesn't
think it's a crime.

337
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,120
And also, he put his age,

338
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,680
like he's writing the world's
worst OkCupid profile.

339
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,960
I'm 36 years old, I've killed before,

340
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,120
and I've got a pretty
weird-shaped penis.

341
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,520
The thing is, when Amanda Hess
went to the police,

342
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,040
she quickly discovered
how ill-equipped they can be

343
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,520
to deal with this sort of thing.

344
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,280
In my home state of California,
it's a crime

345
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,600
to threaten bodily harm
against another person.

346
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,160
When I received my most,
sort of, recent bout of threats

347
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,280
so the police officer
who came to my door,

348
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,520
didn't even understand
what Twitter was,

349
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,280
had no idea how
to investigate such a crime,

350
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,480
and I'm not even sure knew
that it was criminal.

351
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,440
So, it's hard to know what to do
when you're put in that situation.

352
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,440
That's a problem, because the police
cannot investigate the crime

353
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,840
if they genuinely don't understand
the medium in which it happened.

354
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,880
If someone tried to drown you,
you don't want the police saying

355
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,440
"I get the murder attempt, but what's
this water thing you keep bringing up ?

356
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,200
"Is it like air, but a bit more chokey
? Is that what it is ?"

357
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,320
And women aren't just
threatened and harassed online.

358
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,720
The Internet has thrown up
a whole new way to wreck their lives.

359
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,000
It's called revenge porn.
You may have heard of it.

360
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,760
It's when naked photos
of people are posted online

361
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,040
without their consent,
and it can be devastating.

362
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,720
This is Annmarie Chiarini,
an English professor

363
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,720
who let her then-boyfriend
take some private photos of her.

364
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,840
Now, after they broke up,
he sent them to her employer

365
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,360
and her son's kindergarten teacher,
and then this happened.

366
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,320
I received an anonymous email at work

367
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,560
that a profile had been created of me
someone was pretending to be me

368
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,760
and there were nude pictures
on this profile.

369
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,440
So, I googled my name,
and the porn website xhamster came up,

370
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,400
and there was my first and last name,
the name of the college where I teach,

371
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,480
the town where I live,
and a solicitation for sex.

372
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,600
Now, that obviously
sounds like a nightmare.

373
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,800
And sadly, the horror of that situation
led her to some pretty dark places.

374
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,400
My actual thoughts were,
"This is my life."

375
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,240
"This is never gonna end,
so I need to end my life,"

376
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,080
'cause I could not live like that.

377
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,840
So, after... I found the profile,
I attempted suicide.

378
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,040
Now, you would assume that
it's illegal to do that to someone.

379
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,040
The problem is, there is no federal law
specifically against revenge porn.

380
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,920
In Maryland, where she lived, revenge
porn was not illegal at the time.

381
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,880
In fact, only 23 states
have passed laws

382
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,680
specifically against revenge porn.

383
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,000
In the other 27,
it's one of those things

384
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,720
that should be explicitly illegal,
but isn't,

385
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,520
like using a golf umbrella in Manhattan

386
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,320
or returning from a
semester abroad in Spain

387
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,360
and insisting on calling it
"Bar-tha-lona."

388
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,120
You are the worst.

389
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,640
The worst.

390
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,200
The point is...

391
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,360
if you are a victim of revenge porn
in one of those 27 states,

392
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,000
your options are limited.

393
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,600
You can try to pursue stalking
or harassment charges,

394
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,720
but those laws may not always apply.

395
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,280
Or you can file a civil suit
against the person who did it,

396
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,240
but as Annmarie Chiarini found out,
you face an uphill battle.

397
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,240
I did go to lawyers in 2010
to handle this civilly,

398
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,960
and the first one said,

399
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,160
"Well, you really should
get better boyfriends.

400
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,080
"I won't take this case."

401
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,320
The second one I approached said,

402
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,280
"Well, it's gonna be
a $5,000 upfront retainer,"

403
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,720
"and this could run anywhere"

404
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,160
"from 10,000 to 15,000
when all is said and done."

405
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,240
I'm a single mom of two.
I work two jobs.

406
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,840
I don't have $5,000, never mind 15.

407
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,720
Yeah, of course you don't,

408
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,280
because most people don't keep
a shoe box full of money

409
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,280
marked "Just in case a total piece
of shit tries to ruin my life."

410
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,800
Now, you could ask the website to take
the photos down

411
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,440
if you own the copyright.

412
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,760
But if they refuse,
then winning your lawsuit,

413
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,680
might entail doing something
absolutely mind-blowing.

414
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,480
You could sue, but to do that,
you've got to register the copyright.

415
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,400
which brings us
to the cold, hard truth.

416
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,280
In the most extreme case, you've got to
send pictures of your naked body

417
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,040
to the Copyright Office.
That's in Washington.

418
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,200
Yes. To stop strangers from seeing
pictures of their naked body,

419
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,680
some women have had
to send more strangers

420
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,280
more pictures of their naked body.

421
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,720
We are one step away from trying
to protect our children in the future

422
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,000
by having the copyright symbol tattooed
onto their genitals at birth.

423
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,160
Look, just to be safe,
let's take her to Viper's Ink Shack.

424
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,840
We don't know what kind of asshole
she could end up meeting.

425
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,680
This situation is insane,
and as one expert found,

426
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:47,120
the official response to victims
ranges from offensive to ridiculous.

427
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,360
I've interviewed 60 victims
of online harassment

428
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,320
What they're often told is,

429
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,720
"Look, either if it's revenge porn,
you shared pictures with your ex."

430
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,760
"He owns it now.
Sorry that you trusted the person,"

431
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,640
"but it's kinda your fault, right ?"

432
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,280
Or they're told, "Look,
if it's just harassment generally,

433
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,360
"turn off your computer.
Ignore it. It'll go away."

434
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,280
But "Turn off your computer"
is simply not practical.

435
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,280
Almost every job requires
the Internet now.

436
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,280
Somewhere right now, in the world,
there is a yak herder going,

437
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,600
"Why is the Wi-Fi so slow ?

438
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,280
"Fuck it. I'll herd
these yaks after lunch."

439
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,160
And that whole distinctly
victim-blamey sentiment

440
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,680
of "If you didn't want this to happen,
"you shouldn't have taken photos,"

441
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,560
is hardwired into mainstream culture.

442
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,520
Just watch how the news talks about
this whenever it comes up.

443
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,640
How best to avoid this problem ?

444
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,120
Experts say, "Don't take
pictures and then share them."

445
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,400
I think that the teachable moment
and the takeaway is,

446
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,280
you just can't take these pictures.

447
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,120
You know what ? Don't take
naked photos of yourself.

448
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,880
One of the solutions to the problem is
don't take pictures of yourself naked.

449
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,440
- Okay, we've said that.
- Good point.

450
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,200
Kids, don't take pictures
of yourself naked

451
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,360
and put it on the Internets.
It's gonna come up, some point.

452
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,440
And what if it doesn't come up until
you're a parent

453
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,000
and then you've got to explain that ?

454
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,640
What the fuck are you talking about ?

455
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,280
For a start, not taking pictures
doesn't always work.

456
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,520
Sometimes these photos
come from hacked webcams.

457
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,680
Regardless of that,
it doesn't matter how it happens,

458
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,960
because here's a fun game

459
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,600
insert any other crime
into those same sentences.

460
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,680
"Listen, guys,
if you don't want to get burgled,"

461
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,520
"don't live in a house."

462
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,400
"If you're a parent, how are you gonna
explain that break-in to your kids ?"

463
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,200
And look, I'm well aware
that asking law enforcement

464
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,080
to police speech
is a dicey proposition.

465
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,920
No one wants them trolling through
message boards

466
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,640
looking for violent language.

467
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,040
But if a woman turns up
to a police station,

468
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,120
saying someone threatened
her life on Twitter,

469
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,080
the answer, "What's Twitter ?"
is woefully inadequate.

470
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,520
And as for revenge porn,
we're gonna need some new laws.

471
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,600
Fortunately, there are plans
to introduce a bill in Congress

472
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,840
called the
"Intimate Privacy Protection Act"

473
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,040
that aims to address
nonconsensual pornography.

474
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,280
And we've obtained an exclusive video

475
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,720
of one representative's
genuinely moving speech

476
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,000
about balancing First Amendment rights
and protecting victims.

477
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,000
I got you again !

478
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,920
You're a bunch of idiots,
and I'm the king of pranks !

479
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,920
Now, if passed, this law, as drafted,

480
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,360
would make it a crime to post
revenge porn. And don't worry.

481
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,520
It would still leave us with plenty
of Internet porn to keep us going.

482
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,480
And also, the law would
carve out exceptions

483
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,680
for the bona fide public interest.

484
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,080
Meaning that if, say,
a public figure like Anthony Weiner

485
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,960
texted his penis around,
we could all still enjoy that story.

486
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,880
Not being able to enjoy it
would not be a danger.

487
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Danger ! Danger !

488
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,320
Although the truth is

489
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,280
the law can only do so much.

490
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,280
Companies need to be much more diligent

491
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,160
about clamping down on this,
and they are slowly coming around.

492
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,680
In recent months, Twitter and Reddit
banned revenge porn on their sites.

493
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,800
And just this Friday, Google finally
announced, after much prodding,

494
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,080
it would remove photos of revenge porn
from search results upon request.

495
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,960
And for Google to do that
is not nothing,

496
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,160
because we all know, not even
vindictive perverts will use Bing.

497
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,760
They won't do it.
Not even they will go near that thing.

498
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,840
They're not monsters.

499
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,480
And for the rest of us,
it comes down to... to us

500
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,280
and to fundamentally changing the
way that we think about the Internet.

501
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,920
'Cause too often,
you hear people play down

502
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,960
the dangers of the Internet by saying,
"Well, relax. It's not real life."

503
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,080
But it is, and it always has been.

504
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,920
The whole point
of those AOL ads 20 years ago

505
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,440
was that what you did online
would affect your life immediately.

506
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,440
Nowadays, you can click
a button and buy a book

507
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,080
meet your spouse,
or ruin someone's life.

508
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,280
Sometimes those last two
are the same click.

509
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,520
But we all know the Internet
is an incredible tool,

510
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,280
but like most tools,
it can be used as a weapon.

511
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,640
And we've allowed things
to get to a place

512
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,040
where women can fear for their lives
for something they said online

513
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,240
and find themselves mailing
their genitals to Washington

514
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,120
in order to maintain their privacy.

515
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,760
And perhaps we would've dealt
with this earlier

516
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,760
if only those AOL ads
had looked something like this.

517
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,480
Every day, the Internet
is making it easier

518
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,520
for people to live, work, and play.

519
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,280
Hey, Dan, ready for the game ?

520
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,760
I'm just finishing up here
with my new kayaking friends.

521
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,280
Wow. That's a really
specific thing to say.

522
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,000
Listen, I'm not gonna be able
to make the game tonight.

523
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,600
Oh. Why ?

524
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,640
Well, I have to go out into the streets

525
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,280
and scream obscenities
at women that I don't even know,

526
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,280
and then after that,
I've got to handwrite letters

527
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,400
to all the "Golden Girls" telling them
that I'm gonna shit down their throats.

528
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,880
After that I've got to bring

529
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,280
these naked photos
of my ex-wife to her office

530
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,160
and show 'em to everyone
that she works with,

531
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,840
because she's such a bitch.
It's gonna take hours.

532
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,000
Hey, we can do all
of that before we go.

533
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,040
- Yeah, right.
- No, with the Internet.

534
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,800
Look, it's easy.

535
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,440
See ? Here's a random woman
from Minneapolis

536
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,400
who just said how
she felt about something.

537
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,680
You want me to make her
fear for her life ?

538
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,320
Why not ? But how ?

539
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,240
Done !

540
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,520
Incredible. What else
can this thing do to women ?

541
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,960
With the Internet,

542
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,320
the only limit to how miserable
you can make another human being

543
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,680
is how angry you are
and how fast you can type.

544
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,280
Hey, but what about
those photos of my ex-wife ?

545
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,280
Oh, that's my favorite part.

546
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,040
All you have to do
is scan them into this site,

547
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,280
and then people can see it instantly

548
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,640
her boss, her friends,
her parents, everyone.

549
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,720
- Everyone ?
- Everyone.

550
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,920
- Everyone ?
- Everyone.

551
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,040
And this is legal ?

552
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,880
There's no federal law
explicitly against it.

553
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,280
That seems insane.

554
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,640
- Doesn't it ?
- Yeah, it really does.

555
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,520
Anyway, come on.
We're gonna be late for the game.

556
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,640
I can't wait.

557
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,560
Afterwards, I'm gonna fuck
some of my new kayaking buddies.

558
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,040
What ?

559
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,720
The Internet: A Dark Carnival
of Humanity's Most Wretched Impulses.

560
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,960
Also sports, weather,
and pictures of cats.

561
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,640
That's our show.

562
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,040
Thank you so much for watching.
See you again next week. Good night !

563
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,880
You ready to go to the game ?

564
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,320
I'm just finishing up here
with my new kayaking friends.

565
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,080
Listen, I'm not gonna be able
to make the game tonight.

566
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,400
Oh no.

567
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,320
- Why ?
- I gotta go to my wife's office...

568
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,440
If you're gonna type
like a fucking idiot...

569
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,160
