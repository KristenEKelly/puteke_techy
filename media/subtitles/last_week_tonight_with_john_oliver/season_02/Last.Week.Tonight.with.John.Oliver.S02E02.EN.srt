00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,040
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,160
Season II, episode 2

3
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,000
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,960
Thank you for being with us.
A quick recap of this week.

5
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,840
We begin tonight in Yemen.

6
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,400
Home to 26 million Yemeni people
and 27 million American drones.

7
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,960
For years Yemen has worked closely
with the US on counterterrorism issues.

8
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,320
Their government collapsed recently.
This week, things got even worse.

9
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,960
The United States closing down
its embassy in Yemen.

10
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,920
The State Department evacuated
dozens of diplomatic officials,

11
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,080
urging all Americans
to leave that country immediately.

12
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,560
Yes, if you are an American
diplomat in Yemen, evacuate.

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,720
If you're an American tourist,

14
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,200
what the fuck were you doing
taking a vacation in Yemen ?

15
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,720
Bad choice.

16
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,000
A rebel group called the Houthis
appears to be in charge in Yemen.

17
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,800
So, who are they ?
And can we work with them ?

18
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,680
When you speak to them,
they're quite polite and pleasant.

19
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,640
Lovely. How lovely.
Rebels who are polite and pleasant.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,280
Y'know, like Drake.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,400
This all sounds
like it's tremendous news,

22
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,000
unless I interrupted you
too early.

23
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,640
They're polite and pleasant,
but one of their slogans is:

24
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,800
death to America.

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,640
Okay then, okay.
That is completely unacceptable.

26
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,200
Unless they're referring
to the '70s soft rock band America.

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,480
In which case
I totally support them.

28
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,280
You've been through a desert
on a horse with no name ?

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,040
Did it ever occur to you
it's your job to name the horse ?

30
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,320
Call it Cinnamon and ride back.

31
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,080
You might notice he said,
one of their slogans.

32
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,480
And that's because
the full slogan reads:

33
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,200
"God is great, death to America,
death to Israel, curse the Jews,"

34
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,640
"victory to Islam",
which is horrifying,

35
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,240
but still slightly less odious
than "I'm Lovin' it."

36
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,560
Also there is some
potentially good news here:

37
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,600
not only are the Houthis
against Al Qaeda.

38
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,160
They may be trying
to moderate their tone.

39
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,720
I interviewed their leader here
and he was very adamant

40
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,560
about trying to have
better relations with the US

41
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,560
and he even went so far
as to repudiate their slogan

42
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,680
and say "that's just a slogan,
we don't mean it literally."

43
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,360
Okay then. At this point the phrase
death to America lost its meaning.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,560
It's like,
we should really hang out sometime

45
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,040
or I'm sorry, or I love you,
they're things to say...

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,360
Moving on to other major news
this week,

47
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,640
we saw the worldwide release
of Fifty Shades of Grey.

48
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,800
It's done surprisingly well,

49
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,160
despite the fact that
Jamie Dornan is not my Christian.

50
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,840
Hashtag #notmychristian.

51
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,880
The media has been very excited
about this all week.

52
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,760
Who would not be excited to watch
scintillating dialogue such as this ?

53
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,000
That's impressive.
You a girl scout ?

54
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,920
No, organized group activities
aren't really my thing.

55
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,360
- So what is your thing ?
- I don't know. Books.

56
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,840
My penis just yawned.
I will say...

57
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,800
This movie has provided
a fascinating glimpse

58
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,720
into the attitudes
of various countries.

59
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,720
The UK gave it their equivalent
of an NC-17 rating,

60
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,320
while Malaysia banned it,
calling it more pornography than movie.

61
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,800
Although,
on the basis of that clip we saw,

62
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,040
it's more Home Depot commercial
than pornography.

63
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,040
There is one country
that went in a different direction.

64
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,920
Here in the US, 50 Shades of Grey
is rated R,

65
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,480
kids under 17 must
be accompanied by an adult.

66
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,000
The French are giving the green
light to kids as young as 12.

67
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,680
Yes, France is allowing 12-year-olds
to watch Fifty Shades of Grey.

68
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,960
That is maybe
the Frenchest thing imaginable

69
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,760
other than a croissant sitting
in a cafe eating a baguette,

70
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,080
or maybe a mime feeding invisible
cheese to his invisible mistress

71
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,640
with a visible erection.

72
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,800
It's pretty French.
Just out of interest for me,

73
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,400
what was the reasoning
for such a rating ?

74
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,880
The French official says isn't a film
that can shock a lot of people.

75
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,080
The decision wasn't unanimous
but that's only because some there

76
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,320
thought there shouldn't be
any age restriction.

77
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,160
Even 12-year-olds in France
will find the movie tame.

78
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,760
It was an amusing erotic trifle,
I suppose.

79
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:42,640
The lovemaking was passable,
belt play is pedestrian. N'est pas ?

80
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,920
Finally:
a little update on Ecuador.

81
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,840
You may remember last week,
we poked fun at their president,

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,520
who'd been calling out his Twitter
and Facebook critics by name

83
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,480
and encouraging supporters
to attack them online.

84
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,480
He saw what we did
and was not thrilled.

85
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,640
And the reason I know,
and this is true,

86
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,240
the President of Ecuador has been
shit-talking me on Twitter,

87
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,760
saying, and this is true,
among other things...

88
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:20,680
He said these gringo talk shows
are as unpleasant as a diuretic.

89
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,840
Do British comedians exist ?
Are you all sure about this ?

90
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,560
And he's right.
British comedian is an oxymoron.

91
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,160
Much like jumbo shrimp

92
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,880
or Ecuadorian President
who prioritizes his time wisely,

93
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,720
but it gets worse.

94
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,720
Correa gave his weekly
televised address to the nation

95
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,160
and he was still annoyed
about this.

96
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,240
With international backing
there is a funny campaign

97
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,280
that says
that we are against humor

98
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,880
because now they will show you
Twitters that we want to stop.

99
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,880
Imagine that, me, against humor ?
But my jokes are known worldwide !

100
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,440
Let me stop you there.
That's almost true.

101
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,480
It's not so much that your jokes
are known worldwide,

102
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,080
as that you are becoming known
worldwide as a joke.

103
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,960
That's the thing...
I would stop this.

104
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,240
I would stop making fun
of Correa's oversensitivity,

105
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,160
but he has a history of stifling
dissent in Ecuador.

106
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,400
He's clamped down on journalists,

107
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,920
from suing a newspaper that
said he was acting like a dictator,

108
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,560
to humiliating a female reporter
who asked him a tough question,

109
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,400
calling her a horrible fatty.

110
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,600
Fatty is one of the least
presidential words imaginable.

111
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,360
It's right up there with
awesomesauce and fingerblast.

112
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,480
You don't want to hear that
from a world leader.

113
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,840
There is one thing I would like
to correct from last week.

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,120
I showed a clip of this clown
during Correa's speech.

115
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,080
It turned out that
was actually no random clown.

116
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,480
That was Tiko-Tiko,
a beloved children's entertainer.

117
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,720
Tiko-Tiko was upset
and called me grotesque.

118
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,800
When a clown calls you grotesque,
it hurts.

119
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,040
I will apologize to Tiko-Tiko,
and I'll tell you why,

120
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,280
because I do not want
this man angry with me.

121
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,360
That plays in the background
when a psychopath ties you up

122
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,880
and tortures you
with dental instruments.

123
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,240
I am sorry, Tiko-Tiko. Please don't
make me saw my leg off to escape you.

124
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,120
And now, this.

125
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,000
Last Week Tonight asks,
how is this still a thing ?

126
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,200
Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.
How is this still a thing ?

127
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,160
Sports Illustrated, the preferred
magazine of dads since 1954,

128
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,920
highlighting great moments in sport,
from the miracle on ice

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,200
to that one time Vince Lombardi
got punched by Green Bay Packers.

130
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,720
Every February, S.I. releases
its most popular annual issue

131
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,840
to a creepy chorus of approval.

132
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,280
Check it out, Mike Jerrick,
look at the screen.

133
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,320
The swimsuit issue is coming out
next Tuesday, a great magazine.

134
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,680
It's even worse when
the models are in the studio.

135
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,480
Will you be my Valentine ?

136
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,200
I want the chocolate but there's
a little bit of a waiting list.

137
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,240
Thank you so much.
Courtney, I love you baby.

138
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,560
Courtney is Taryn's wife. Expecting
their first child any moment now.

139
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,640
The swimsuit edition was created by
Andre Laguerre in 1964,

140
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,160
to boost sales
between sport seasons.

141
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,920
It was a perfect expression
of the sixties,

142
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,200
a time of such
rampant casual sexism,

143
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,200
that it gave birth to the sexual
harassment in the workplace film.

144
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,000
If you two want to get knocked up,
John and I are glad to help you.

145
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,840
But as society moved on, the swimsuit
issue not only hung around,

146
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,720
it became the magazine's
key selling point.

147
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,040
You get basketball, football,
tennis, golf and...

148
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,000
And the famous swimsuit issue.

149
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,400
Revealing 1991 swimsuit issue
and the free sneaker phone.

150
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,400
- The swimsuit issue.
- That's the icing on the cake.

151
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,720
The swimsuit issue
is still moving copies.

152
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,960
It sold more than 800 000 copies
on newsstands in 2013,

153
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,600
more than 10 times what a regular
issue of Sports Illustrated sold.

154
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,120
Which raises the question, why ?
At one point it was tantalizing

155
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,840
to receive a once annual printed
magazine of scantily clad women.

156
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,480
Do people not understand they could
now just type naked ladies

157
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,480
into the internet and see
what Google throws at them ?

158
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,160
Even S.I. seems to know
it's losing relevance,

159
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,040
every year they provoke
an attention grabbing controversy.

160
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,520
Whether it's using other
country's citizens as props.

161
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Some are calling them at best,
culturally insensitive.

162
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,240
Objectifying women
with an actual object.

163
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,240
Barbie is on the cover of the
swimsuit issue and there is outrage.

164
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,520
Or this year, baiting the media
with this bullshit.

165
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,240
Some are questioning
whether the cover is too lewd.

166
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,720
Too risqué ?

167
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,120
When the line goes this far,
what's left ?

168
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,840
The vagina is what's left
and one of these years,

169
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,040
in an act of desperation,
S.I. will put one on the cover.

170
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,120
Until that time, it's left to
the rest of us to ask ourselves:

171
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,720
the Sports Illustrated swimsuit
issue, how is this still a thing ?

172
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,240
Moving on.
Our main story tonight is tobacco.

173
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,240
It used to be
a cornerstone of American life.

174
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,200
It was how we knew sex was over
before the female orgasm was invented.

175
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,080
Even if you didn't smoke, you
could not escape those who did.

176
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,920
Cigarettes were in the hands
of trusted newsmen,

177
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,480
cartoon characters
and cowboys in TV commercials.

178
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,520
You had your supper and coffee,
the horses are settling down,

179
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,600
you start to think
about Saturday night in town.

180
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,560
Come to where the flavor is.
Come to Marlboro country.

181
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,120
That's the iconic Marlboro man,
as synonymous with freedom

182
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,320
as he was with dying from
smoking-related diseases,

183
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,280
because that's what happened
to four of the actors who played him.

184
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,240
Four dead actors !

185
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,640
It's like if there was a gas leak
on Whose Line Is It Anyway ?

186
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,640
Why did you all have
to yes and each other ?

187
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:47,240
It is weird seeing cigarette ads now.
For the past half-century,

188
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,120
America limited how tobacco companies
are able to behave.

189
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,080
We've put warning labels on
packaging and banned cigarette ads,

190
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,720
executives defended themselves
against public-health questions.

191
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,800
It's true, that babies born to women
who smoke are smaller,

192
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,680
but they're as healthy as the babies
born to women who do not smoke

193
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,000
and some women prefer
having smaller babies.

194
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,720
You heard it, pregnant ladies:
enough cigarettes

195
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,840
and you're pretty much
just shooting out Lego babies.

196
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,120
They fit in Star Wars toys !
Who wouldn't want that ?

197
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:32,360
By the late '90s, tobacco companies
retired not just the Marlboro man,

198
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,800
but also Joe Camel, who people
accused of being targeted at children,

199
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,240
because he was a cartoon camel
who dressed like the Fonz and smoked.

200
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,480
These restrictions helped lower
smoking rates in the US

201
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,040
from about 43 percent in 1965
to 18 percent today.

202
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,680
Which you would assume would
decimate the tobacco industry.

203
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,640
Which is what makes this
clip from 2008 so surprising.

204
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,400
Tobacco is what you might call,
smoking hot.

205
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,040
Is this the best time ever
to be a tobacco farmer ?

206
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,600
The most profitable.

207
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,800
It's an aging product
that's decreasing in popularity,

208
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,080
and yet
it just can't stop making money.

209
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,960
It's the agricultural equivalent
of U2.

210
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:25,400
One of the reasons for this might be
that while Americans smoke less,

211
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,360
in some parts of the world,
people are smoking more,

212
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,520
to an occasionally shocking extent,
you might remember this video.

213
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:38,040
The video of this two-year-old boy,
he's just puffing away on a cigarette.

214
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,400
The mom says he is addicted
and if he doesn't get the smokes,

215
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,360
he gets angry, starts
banging his head on the wall.

216
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,000
He gets mad when you take away his
smokes. He thinks they're gone,

217
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,360
he doesn't have
object permanence yet !

218
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,480
The smoking baby
was such a sensation,

219
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,760
news crews attempted to find him.

220
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,600
Just across this bridge,
lies the small fishing village

221
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,720
that is home to the smoking baby.

222
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,360
We briefly caught up with Aldi
and his mother at the airport,

223
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,200
flanked by a local TV crew.

224
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,040
Are you Aldi ? Hi, I'm Dan.
How you doing, little dude ?

225
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,720
Holy shit, look at that kid.
He's his own rat pack.

226
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,560
He's missing three other kids
dressed like him and a casino.

227
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,880
And this is where this story
gets interesting.

228
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:33,120
That baby's favorite brand was
A Mild, owned by Philip Morris,

229
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,680
the company that sells Philip Morris
brands everywhere but America.

230
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,480
They, like other multinationals,
have flocked to Indonesia,

231
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,920
where two-thirds of adult males
smoke and there are few restrictions.

232
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,000
And I do mean very few.

233
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,200
This brings home the point,
this is the entrance to a school.

234
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,720
A few steps from the entrance,

235
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,760
there is this kiosk
sponsored by Marlboro Lights.

236
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,760
A student can come and
buy an individual cigarette,

237
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,600
they're only a dime a piece and
they have a lighter on a string.

238
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,680
Of course the lighter's
on a string !

239
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,240
What kind of irresponsible
cigarette vendor outside a school

240
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,680
would let a child
walk away with a lighter ?

241
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,800
They're dangerous.
Just think about that.

242
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,680
Indonesia is far from the only
country where PMI expanded.

243
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,640
They own seven of the world's
top 15 international brands.

244
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,680
And recently, Marlboro boosted
its global market share,

245
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,640
thanks to its worldwide "don't be
a maybe, be Marlboro" campaign.

246
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,160
If you think: what the fuck does
"don't be a maybe" mean ?

247
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,720
Let the video by the people responsible
for the campaign explain it to you:

248
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,600
As a brand, Marlboro was not
resonating with adult smokers,

249
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,720
though its values of freedom,
authenticity, master of destiny were.

250
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,880
Smokers missed
the essence of the cowboy,

251
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,960
which led us to our opportunity.

252
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,120
Eliminate the word "maybe"
from our smokers' vocabulary,

253
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,280
to become the catalyst that
inspires smokers

254
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,840
from just thinking about life
to taking the lead in their life.

255
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,240
To live the Marlboro values.

256
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,480
To be true, bold
and forever forward.

257
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,160
That is a pile of horseshit.

258
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,320
Even, think about it...

259
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,520
Don Draper looks at that ad and
goes, "pull it back a little bit".

260
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,960
"These are cigarettes
we're talking about, not Jesus."

261
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,760
Countries can try to counteract
the influence of that marketing.

262
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,400
But if tobacco companies
feel too threatened,

263
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,560
they'll put them
through legal hell.

264
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,680
Let me take you on a world tour
of how they attack public health laws.

265
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,960
It's kind of amazing.
Let's start in Australia.

266
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,760
In 2011, they passed a plain packaging
law. What that means is this.

267
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,600
Cigarettes come
in packaging like this.

268
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,120
Drab coloring, messaging
the Australian government rights,

269
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,320
pictures, the brand name
relegated to the bottom.

270
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,560
Australia's plain packaging law
banned tobacco-company branding

271
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,720
from packaging, and replaced it
with upsetting photos.

272
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,080
Toe tag on a corpse,
the cancerous mouth,

273
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,840
the nightmarish eyeball
or the diseased lung.

274
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,480
I'm pretty sure I would find
a healthy lung disgusting.

275
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:31,120
But that look like you're trying
to breathe through baked ziti.

276
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,920
So just take that down.

277
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,880
Since this law was implemented,

278
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,920
total consumption in Australia
fell to record lows.

279
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,720
And nightmares about eyeballs
have risen to record highs.

280
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,640
Take down the demon eye.

281
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,160
To get these laws, Australia has
had to run a gamut of lawsuits.

282
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:57,280
Two tobacco companies sued Australia
in its highest court to stop them.

283
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,320
The result was surprising,

284
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,280
as Australia's Attorney General
let everyone know.

285
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:08,280
We have won that legal action
and just as some icing on the cake,

286
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,640
it seems that the big companies
will pay the government's costs.

287
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,960
Yes !
Score one for the little guy.

288
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,240
Even if that little guy is the sixth
largest country in the world.

289
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,840
The tobacco companies
didn't just lose.

290
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,720
Judges called their case delusive,
unreal and synthetic

291
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,840
and said it had fatal defects.

292
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,800
Which sounds a little like the early
reviews of NBC's "The Slap".

293
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,120
What is this thing ? How long
am I supposed to watch it for ?

294
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,440
Which one is the slap ?

295
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,160
But Australia's legal troubles
were just beginning.

296
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,880
Philip Morris Asia got involved.

297
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,840
The company is threatening
to take the Australian government

298
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,600
to an international court and says
that removing brands from packs

299
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,400
will lower the value of its trademark.

300
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,800
A company was able to sue a
country over a public-health measure,

301
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,840
through an international court.

302
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,360
How the fuck is that possible ?
It's really a simple explanation.

303
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,040
They dig up a 1993 trade agreement
between Australia and Hong Kong,

304
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,160
in which Australia couldn't seize
Hong Kong based companies' property.

305
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,880
Nine months
before the lawsuit started,

306
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,480
PMI put its Australian business
in the hands of its Hong Kong

307
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,280
based PM Asia division
and then, they sued,

308
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,120
claiming that the seized "property"
were the trademarks on their packages.

309
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,040
You've gotta give it to them:
that's impressive.

310
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,000
Someone should give
those lawyers a pat on the back.

311
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,240
And a punch in the face.
But a pat on the back first.

312
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,040
Pat then punch. Pat, punch.
They need a pat punch.

313
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,640
Little pat big punch,
that's what they need.

314
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,320
You'll never guess who else
is coming after Australia.

315
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,280
Three governments, Honduras,
the Dominican Republic and Ukraine

316
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:08,280
filed complaints with the WTO
against Australia's laws.

317
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,320
Ukraine is charging Australia with
hurting its tobacco exports.

318
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,840
Which was a surprise
to a Ukrainian member of parliament.

319
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,360
When I first read about
the position of the government,

320
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,440
it seems to me a joke, cause
we have zero trade exchange

321
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,760
between Australia and Ukraine
of any tobacco goods.

322
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,080
Zero trade ! Zero.
Ukraine is inserting themselves

323
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,640
into something
they have nothing to do with.

324
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,520
They take the Kanye West approach
to international trade disputes.

325
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,720
Just wiggling in there.

326
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,760
The truth is, tobacco companies
have encouraged these suits,

327
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,360
even covering some
of the legal costs.

328
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,000
The tobacco industry is treating
Ukraine like a stage parent

329
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,120
treats a child
in a beauty pageant.

330
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,440
Brandy wants to do it !
Yes, I paid for her outfit

331
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,880
and I've pushed her onto the stage,
but this was all her idea.

332
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,040
Brandy, if you drop that flaming
baton, you are walking home.

333
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,120
You walk home, Brandy !

334
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,960
And tobacco companies aren't
just going after big countries.

335
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:23,360
PM launched a legal challenge
against the small country of Uruguay

336
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,920
for damaging
its business prospects.

337
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,480
Uruguay has a population of just
three and a half million people

338
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,520
and is a relatively
tiny cigarette market.

339
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,600
Philip Morris International
is currently suing Uruguay.

340
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,520
A country you think about so little
that you didn't even notice

341
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,960
that that's not Uruguay,
this is Uruguay.

342
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,280
Now the background here.
Nine years ago,

343
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,840
Uruguay started introducing
increasingly larger health warnings.

344
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,200
Smoking rates dropped
and Uruguayans liked the laws,

345
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,080
with 68 percent of smokers saying
they should be stronger.

346
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,560
But that hasn't stopped PMI from
suing them for the past five years.

347
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,240
And that's a lot for a small country.
Luckily, they have had help.

348
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,120
Uruguay has received the support
of the World Health Organization

349
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,560
and the Pan American
Health Organization,

350
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,520
as well as the mayor of New York,
Michael Bloomberg,

351
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,240
who donated $500 000
for payment of attorney's fees.

352
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,360
The legal fees were
getting so expensive,

353
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,040
they had to take money
from Michael Bloomberg.

354
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,960
On the scale of how shitty
that has got to feel,

355
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,880
it's just barely higher
than borrowing money

356
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,360
from your ex-girlfriend's,
current boyfriend's stepdad.

357
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,720
And if forcing Uruguay to do
that was not bad enough,

358
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,400
let me tell you what PMI
has done to Togo.

359
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,880
Togo is one of the ten poorest
countries on earth.

360
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,760
And they unveiled
some new tobacco laws.

361
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,280
Togo is setting conditions
on the sale of tobacco.

362
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,760
Starting on September 1, 2014,
packs of cigarettes sold in Togo

363
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,200
must bear warnings in French,
Ewé and Kabiyé

364
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,000
about the health risks associated
with the consumption of tobacco.

365
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,800
At first, written warnings
sound great.

366
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,080
Until you learn that 40 percent
of the adult population is illiterate.

367
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,120
Which is why some members
of the Togolese government

368
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,680
wanted something more like
Australia's ziti lung packaging.

369
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,160
Take it down.
It's still disgusting.

370
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,120
When they got wind of this,
Philip Morris International,

371
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,360
a company with annual
net revenues of $80 billion,

372
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:43,040
threatened to sue Togo,
whose entire GDP is $4.3 billion.

373
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,960
When your GDP is a couple of billion
more than the box office of Avatar,

374
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,600
a protracted legal case
is not really what you need.

375
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,920
We reached out to Togo
and asked to see their correspondence

376
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,120
with the tobacco companies and
they gave us this letter from PMI.

377
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,360
We had to translate it from
French, but it was worth it.

378
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:09,440
This thing is appalling. It informs
Togo that plain packaging laws

379
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,720
would result in an incalculable amount
of international trade litigation,

380
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,000
suggesting Togo would lose
any legal challenge by citing

381
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,600
an Australian high court decision,
which they write:

382
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,560
"plain packaging constitutes
a privation of property rights."

383
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,120
The court case they're referring to
is the one from earlier.

384
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,000
The one tobacco companies
lost so badly,

385
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,120
they had to cover the court costs.

386
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,640
Yet they quote the one judge in that
case who ruled in favor of tobacco,

387
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,320
ignoring the other six
who called their case

388
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,800
delusive, unreal and synthetic
and saying it had fatal defects.

389
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,160
Like when a shitty movie engineers
a good review out of a bad one,

390
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,680
like Mortdecai is a pile
of dot dot dot great.

391
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,920
This letter is bullshit.

392
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,000
Yet Togo, justifiably terrified by
threats of billion dollar settlements,

393
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,520
backed down from a public health
law that many people wanted.

394
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,120
And it's not just Togo.
BAT sent a similar letter to Namibia.

395
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,800
And one of their subsidiaries
sent one to the Solomon Islands,

396
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,560
a country with a population
of 600 000.

397
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,760
It's safe to say, if you live
with at least two other people

398
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,840
and you ask one of them
to smoke outside,

399
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,160
you can look forward to a letter from
a tobacco company very soon.

400
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,040
I could get angry and I could
call tobacco companies assholes

401
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,840
or monsters
or open sores on Satan's dick.

402
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,480
Let's rise above it
and let's try and broker peace.

403
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:54,000
It's clear what each side wants:
countries want to warn their citizens

404
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,640
about the health dangers
of smoking tobacco.

405
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,360
Tobacco companies want
to present branded images.

406
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:08,120
May I suggest a compromise ?
I present the new face of Marlboro:

407
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,560
Jeff, the diseased lung
in a cowboy hat.

408
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,680
We are offering Jeff to you,
PMI, to use as you wish.

409
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,480
Put him on your billboards !
Put him on some ads !

410
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:25,520
In fact, we've already
started doing it for you.

411
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,960
This is an actual billboard
we have put up in Uruguay

412
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,560
of Jeff the diseased lung.

413
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:39,280
That is in Montevideo now.
And people seem to like it there !

414
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,760
Of course they like it !

415
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,360
Everyone loves Jeff the diseased
lung in a cowboy hat !

416
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,440
One more thing.
To be completely honest,

417
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,840
we didn't just do it in Uruguay.

418
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,320
We also, and don't be mad,
we made some Jeff-branded t-shirts

419
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,920
and we shipped them to Togo,
where they've been a hit.

420
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,480
If you don't believe me,
check this out.

421
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,320
Marlboro, Jeff's already out there !
You just need to claim him.

422
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,120
Our lawyers, unlike yours,
will not sue !

423
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,040
I know our viewers would love
to help you get the message out.

424
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,240
You can tweet about Jeff using
the hashtag #jeffwecan

425
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,120
to get him trending worldwide
and get PMI's attention.

426
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,440
Post Jeff's photo on Google Plus
and tag him Marlboro,

427
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,240
which might push him to the top
of Marlboro's Google image search.

428
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,760
We can do this, everyone !
Don't be a maybe about this !

429
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:55,680
Who here would like to meet Jeff ?
Let's bring Jeff out ! Come on, Jeff !

430
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,840
It's Jeff everyone !
It's Jeff the diseased lung !

431
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,840
Look at him, Marlboro,
he's not a maybe !

432
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,680
He's not a maybe because
he's suffering from emphysema.

433
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,920
Aren't you, Jeff ?

434
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,640
Classic Jeff !
And guess what, PMI ?

435
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:22,520
Even though, you do not market
to children, kids love Jeff, too !

436
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,880
Don't you, kids ?

437
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,480
What do you say, Marlboro ?
Let's make Jeff happen !

438
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,800
That's our show,
see you next week, goodnight !

439
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,920
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

440
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,920
END OF EPISODE 2,
SEASON II
