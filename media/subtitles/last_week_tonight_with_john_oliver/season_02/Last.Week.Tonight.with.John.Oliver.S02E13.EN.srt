LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,040
Season 2
Episode 13

3
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,920
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,920
Thank you so much
for joining us.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,200
I'm John Oliver. Just time
for a quick recap of the week.

6
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,200
And we begin
in the United Kingdom,

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,800
America's deadbeat dad.

8
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,200
The UK held its election
on Thursday,

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,400
and virtually every poll predicted
the prime minister, David Cameron,

10
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,240
and his Conservative party
would be unable to win a majority.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,000
But in a dramatic twist,

12
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,880
it turned out
that everyone was wrong.

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,000
We are seeing the Conservatives
are the largest party.

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,160
I think there really is
quite a lot of shock

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,920
amongst a lot of people,
when you think

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,200
the way the polls went
in the run-up to the election.

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,360
It's an even more dramatic result
than we were predicting.

18
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,960
It's an outright win
for the Conservatives.

19
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,560
Total shock, really, from where
we started in the evening.

20
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,560
To be fair,

21
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,560
that is about as emotional
as a British newsreader

22
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,200
is capable of being.

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,320
The American equivalent
of what you just saw

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,920
would be Wolf Blitzer
stripping naked

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,920
and setting fire
to his own beard.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,320
But in fact, this result
was such a surprise

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,560
that when the exit polls
were first announced,

28
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,600
the former head of the Liberal
Democrats, Lord Paddy Ashdown,

29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,320
didn't quite believe it.

30
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,920
If this exit poll is right,

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,520
Andrew, I will publicly
eat my hat on your program.

32
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,920
Now, just so you know,

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,120
that's a little disingenuous,
because this is his hat.

34
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,120
So the context is important.
It looks delicious.

35
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,520
This election may well
fundamentally change the UK forever,

36
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,320
because the Scottish
National Party,

37
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,600
who last year came close
to winning a referendum

38
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,920
on Scottish independence,

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
won almost every seat
in Scotland,

40
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,400
leading many to speculate
about what comes next.

41
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,000
The strong showing by
the Scottish National Party,

42
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,200
the SNP, could fuel a fresh push
for Scottish independence.

43
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,200
Again ?

44
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,000
We have to beg
to keep Scotland again ?

45
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,760
Don't make me bring
out the unicorn, Scotland.

46
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,920
I can't do it.
We killed it.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,600
We killed it
and we ate it.

48
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,200
Not because we were hungry,
not because we were curious,

49
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,400
we just did it.

50
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,400
Now, you might assume that England
would take this threat seriously.

51
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,200
But if you want the purest distillation
of English arrogance

52
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,200
when it comes
to Scotland's importance,

53
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,720
then consider this,
a 20-year-old woman

54
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,000
had just defeated
the shadow foreign secretary

55
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,720
and she was talking
about the importance

56
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,320
of Scotland's voice being heard.

57
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,920
And this is how
the BBC reacted.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,320
The people of Scotland
are speaking

59
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,320
and it is time for their voice
to be heard at Westminster.

60
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,920
We'll come back in a moment
to Paisley and Renfrewshire...

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,960
"Sure, we could hear
Scotland's voice,

62
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,680
"which to my ear,
sounds a bit like a potbellied pig

63
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,200
"running a triathlon,

64
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,440
"or we could listen
to literally anything else.

65
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,960
"Besides, rumor has it,
a dusty old man

66
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,560
"is about to come
on television and eat a hat.

67
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,920
So that's unmissable."

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,240
So let's move on.

69
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,240
Let's move on
to the world of boxing.

70
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,040
Last Saturday,
millions of people

71
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,560
watched an unrepentant
domestic abuser named Floyd

72
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,440
repeatedly hit
a Filipino congressman in the face.

73
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,400
It turned out many people
were disappointed with the fight,

74
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,400
including one notable
world leader, Hun Sen,

75
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,520
the prime minister
of Cambodia.

76
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,000
Apparently, he's a massive
Manny Pacquiao fan.

77
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,040
And he was pissed.

78
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,160
Let me talk about protesting
with the referee

79
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,920
who judged the World Boxing
Championship match yesterday.

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,240
I can't believe
the American judges

81
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,920
are that poor,
really very poor.

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,880
That was not
a one-off comment.

83
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,920
He devoted about 15 minutes
of a speech

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,320
exclusively to the outcome
of the fight.

85
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,800
Bear in mind,
the Gettysburg Address

86
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,640
was three minutes long

87
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,840
and had little to no references
to boxing in it.

88
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,320
And if you're wondering

89
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,920
why the Cambodian prime minister
cares so much,

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,720
well, it turns out he had a $5,000 bet
on Pacquiao,

91
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,680
and he wanted
to make it clear

92
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,560
that he was not
going to pay.

93
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,160
Hey, the 5,000 U.S. dollars
you want

94
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,960
is not finalized yet.

95
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,480
It is not yet settled.

96
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,120
So I'm not going
to pay yet.

97
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,960
I'm not paying yet
because I need to find justice first.

98
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,240
Hold on.

99
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,000
That's not how gambling works.

100
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,400
You can't retroactively
void your bet

101
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,480
because you didn't agree
with the outcome.

102
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,640
Even the people who bet
against the Patriots

103
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,400
aren't demanding
their money back,

104
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,400
and that team was essentially
tossing around

105
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,600
a floppy leather handbag.

106
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,720
And it's a little difficult...

107
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,720
It's a little difficult
to hear Hun Sen

108
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,920
lecture anyone about
fair play for two reasons.

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,520
First, this is a man who,
Human Rights Watch says,

110
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
has repeatedly
used political violence,

111
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,800
repression and corruption
to remain in power.

112
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,440
And secondly, if we're
really talking fairness,

113
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,480
let me point out that this was him
trotting out onto the field

114
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,360
to take part in a not-at-all-staged
soccer match

115
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,680
in which all his opponents
tried desperately hard

116
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,920
to get him to score a goal,
and it wasn't easy.

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,280
After that display,

118
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,280
you do not get to comment
about officiating fairness,

119
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,680
or anything having to do
with sports ever again.

120
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,080
You owe your people
and that ball an apology.

121
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,920
But, finally,
finally this week,

122
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,320
Russia, where despite
appearances to the contrary,

123
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,720
the cathedrals
are not edible.

124
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,000
It was the 70th anniversary
of VE Day this week,

125
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,600
when Allied forces
formally defeated the Nazis,

126
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,560
and Russia went all-out
to mark the occasion.

127
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,360
Russia's biggest-ever
Victory Day parade

128
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,800
to mark 70 years
since the Nazi surrender.

129
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,080
16,000 servicemen,

130
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,920
nearly 200 units
of hardware,

131
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,120
140 helicopters
and planes.

132
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,520
Cameras have been placed
in every conceivable location,

133
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,240
embedded in the road...

134
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,840
... and onboard
some of the aircraft

135
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,360
taking part in a fly-past.

136
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,920
"Yes, and we don't just
have cameras there.

137
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,920
"We also have cameras
on the horse foot.

138
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,280
"And even inside
Putin mouth.

139
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,920
"Many cameras
for you to enjoy.

140
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,880
Many cameras."

141
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,800
But as triumphant,

142
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,040
as triumphant
as the parade was,

143
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,640
you couldn't help feeling like there
was something missing.

144
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,040
Today's parade was attended
by some 20 world leaders,

145
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,000
but President Vladimir Putin
had invited more than 70.

146
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,560
Most Western leaders
stayed away

147
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,080
in protest
over Russia's actions in Ukraine.

148
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,400
Ouch.

149
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,760
Less than a third
of invitees showed up.

150
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,040
And it actually got even sadder
when you look

151
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,360
at Putin's outgoing texts
halfway through the parade,

152
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,960
including, "Where U at ?",

153
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,760
"U on UR way ?",

154
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,760
and, "More of a gathering
than a party,

155
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,760
but you should def swing by."

156
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,800
I mean, that's heartbreaking,
or it would be if Putin's heart

157
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,600
was not a potato
filled with battery acid.

158
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,160
In fact, with so many
Western leaders not turning up,

159
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,760
the parade attendees
amounted to a who's who

160
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,000
of who Putin hasn't pissed off.

161
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,880
Chinese president Xi Jinping

162
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,600
was the most
prominent visitor.

163
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,040
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe,
another willing guest.

164
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,040
Okay, well, get...

165
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,160
Getting the Chinese president
is pretty good.

166
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,160
But no one in the course
of human history

167
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,640
has ever said, "Well,
at least Mugabe came."

168
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,240
To be fair, there was actually
an American presence there

169
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,720
in the form of Steven Seagal.

170
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,920
And I would say
it's the last place

171
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,920
that you'd expect
to see Steven Seagal,

172
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,320
but that wouldn't be true,

173
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,920
because that place,
of course, is a movie set.

174
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,040
I'm just saying, he's the only action
star who is literally too expendable

175
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,040
for The Expendables.

176
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,840
But despite
all this spectacle,

177
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,160
this parade was not actually
the most awe-inspiring thing

178
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,400
that Russia did
to commemorate VE Day,

179
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,520
because there was another military
tribute in Russia this week

180
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,960
that was simply breathtaking.

181
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,920
This is the way Laska
and her friend

182
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,760
Winnie the Pooh
salute their superiors,

183
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,920
as now they are not
just seals,

184
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
but Baikal special forces,

185
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,920
waking up early, physical training,
and of course, shooting practice.

186
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,920
How was that not part
of the parade in Red Square ?

187
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,400
In fact, how was that
not the only thing there ?

188
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,920
There is frankly nothing that projects
a country's greatness

189
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,920
like two heavily-armed seals
in berets.

190
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,240
Bravo, Russia ! Bravo.

191
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,920
And now this.

192
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,920
And now, the continuing adventures

193
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,480
of the most patient man
on television.

194
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,520
Michael, from just outside
of Baltimore, in Owings Mills,

195
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,800
good morning.

196
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,000
Michael, you with us ?

197
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,520
Fuck !

198
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,320
Okay, we'll move on to Al.

199
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,200
We apologize when
callers get through,

200
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,920
and that kind of language
is unacceptable.

201
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,360
Thanks for waiting.
Good morning, with Dane Egli.

202
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,960
Hey, Dane Egli.

203
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,000
Uh, I just wanted to know
how big is your penis ?

204
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
Okay, I apologize
for that call.

205
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,080
Rocky is on the phone.
Good morning.

206
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,520
Hi, am I on ?

207
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,720
You sure are.
Go ahead.

208
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,920
Awesome. I just want
to talk about

209
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,760
how I think that Russian...
cock, big cock...

210
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,880
Okay, let's go to Lore.

211
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,600
I think the CEO
of Bank of America

212
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,600
should be Howard Stern
and Baba Booey.

213
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,800
Okay, we'll stop you there.

214
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,080
They didn't give a shit...

215
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,520
Okay, I'm gonna
stop you there.

216
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,040
Homosexual clubs,
you know, like he was a guy

217
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,480
who just loved to have a dildo
lubed up and shoved...

218
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,920
Okay, I'm gonna stop you
at that point.

219
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,440
But people are saying
that he lost the game on TV

220
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,040
and also my balls.

221
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,960
We'll go to Tom next.

222
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,560
Moving on,

223
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,920
our main story tonight
is Mother's Day.

224
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,120
It's the day
we honor moms,

225
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,440
as opposed to every other day
when we look at our phones

226
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,960
and go, "Yeah, not now."

227
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,920
Mother's Day is not just
an opportunity

228
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,920
to do something
for your mom,

229
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,920
it's an opportunity for businesses
to be the thing that you do for them.

230
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,760
JC Penney believes Mom deserves
to get everything she wants.

231
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,640
The JC Penney
Mother's Day Sale.

232
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,640
Baskin-Robbins
Mother's Day cake.

233
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,880
Pick one up today.

234
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,080
For Mother's Day,

235
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,920
personalize your M&Ms
on MyMMs.com.

236
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,920
Welcome to Hooters.
Right this way.

237
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,840
Moms rock. Bring yours
to Hooters on Mother's Day

238
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
and she'll eat free.

239
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,920
Perfect.

240
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,040
What better way
to honor the woman

241
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,200
who gave you life
than taking her to Hooters ?

242
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,000
"Mom, I just want
to thank you

243
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,000
"for making me
the man I am today,

244
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,320
"a man who takes his mother
to a Hooters on Mother's Day.

245
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,800
"By the way,
I don't have to pay for you,

246
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,000
so order me some wings."

247
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:09,120
Even America's national pastime
wants to publicly acknowledge mothers.

248
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,680
Hey, Mets fans. Come spend Mother's Day
at City Field on Sunday, May 11.

249
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,440
Every mom in attendance
is going to receive this Mets T-shirt.

250
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,320
On Sunday, May 11th,

251
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,920
make sure your mom receives
this Dodgers Mother's Day clutch.

252
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,040
Celebrate Mother's Day
with the home team.

253
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,200
The first 10,000 women
get a Rays flower pot.

254
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,600
It's the perfect gift
for the mom

255
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,480
who enjoys the three Bs,

256
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,640
baseball, botany,

257
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,040
and being disappointed
with her Mother's Day gift.

258
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,560
In America, there is nothing
we wouldn't do for moms,

259
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,440
apart from one major thing.

260
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,240
According to
the United Nations,

261
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,440
we and Papua New Guinea
are the only countries in the world

262
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,000
that do not provide
any paid time off for new mothers.

263
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,240
Just us
and Papua New Guinea.

264
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,840
That's as unlikely a pairing

265
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,000
as Sofía Vergara
and Reese Witherspoon.

266
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,920
Separately, great.

267
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,840
But if it's just
the two of them with no one else,

268
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,240
it makes you feel like one of them
has taken her eye off the ball.

269
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,920
Reese.

270
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,880
In the US, here in the US,

271
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,800
federal law grants workers
just 12 weeks of unpaid leave.

272
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,320
And there are
some stark limits on that.

273
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,040
You have to work for a company
with 50 or more employees.

274
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,240
You have to have been there
for over a year.

275
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,440
You have to be a full-time
salaried employee.

276
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,240
So if you're a freelancer, contractor,
something like that,

277
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,800
it doesn't apply to you.

278
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,080
And what that means
is that 40% of workers

279
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,520
are not covered
by the federal law.

280
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,840
So if a worker with no paid leave
goes into labor at work,

281
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,840
she better hope
it's on her lunch hour

282
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,920
and that her coworkers don't mind
if the break room gets a bit messy.

283
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,920
And this is not to say
that women don't take leave.

284
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,080
They just have to get very creative
about doing it.

285
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,920
What we have right now,
women do take maternity leave.

286
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,600
It is oftentimes unpaid.

287
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,720
And it is through
a patchwork system

288
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,720
where they use up
their vacation time,

289
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,320
they use up
their sick days.

290
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,600
One woman I talked to
put her maternity leave,

291
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,240
essentially,
on her credit cards.

292
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,360
Now, sure,
that sounds bad,

293
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,920
but on the plus side,
think of all the points she earned

294
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,920
towards vacation
she can't now take

295
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,160
because she has
a fucking baby.

296
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,920
This is not how
it's supposed to work.

297
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,040
Mothers shouldn't
have to stitch together time

298
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,920
to recover from childbirth

299
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,200
the same way that we plan
four-day weekends in Atlantic City.

300
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,600
"I'll take
a vacation day Thursday,

301
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,920
"call out sick Friday,
hit the slots Saturday,

302
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
"win big Sunday,
and I'll never go back, baby !

303
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,840
Whoo !"

304
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,640
And look,

305
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,920
there are women
who want to get back to work

306
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,200
as soon as they can,
and that's obviously fine.

307
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,320
But for many women,
the current situation

308
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,960
forces them to return
well before they want to,

309
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,760
like this new mother.

310
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,360
Right now I'm using
the family medical leave

311
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,960
for my time.

312
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,960
It's not paid.

313
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,960
And it'll guarantee me
my position back

314
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,760
only for 12 weeks.

315
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,440
I see myself probably,
maybe, like,

316
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,840
a month.

317
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,640
That's...

318
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,040
I don't see myself
taking longer than that.

319
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,000
I don't know how I could
take longer than that.

320
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,760
So...
probably like a month.

321
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,160
That is a woman

322
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,160
who deserves real gratitude

323
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,160
in the form of a Tampa Bay
Rays flower pot,

324
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,840
just to help her
and the baby.

325
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,400
And that's if your pregnancy
goes according to plan.

326
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,200
If a baby is born prematurely,
parents can be forced

327
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,440
to make some truly
heart-wrenching choices,

328
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,240
like Selena Allen, whose baby
was six weeks premature

329
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,960
and who knew
that she could only afford

330
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,240
to take four weeks off
in total.

331
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,960
We decided the best thing
we could do

332
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,560
is to spend the one month
with Carr

333
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,560
when he was home with us.

334
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,200
I gave birth
on a Wednesday.

335
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,200
And on Monday,
I went back to work.

336
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,680
It was like a piece of me
got left in that hospital,

337
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,120
and now I had to pretend
that I'm okay.

338
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,040
Okay, that's terrible.

339
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,720
Although, I will say,

340
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,960
you have definitely got
everyone's bullshit

341
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,280
"What I did
over the weekend" story beat.

342
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,920
"Oh, oh, really, Carol ?

343
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,880
"Skydiving ?
That's interesting.

344
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,880
"I dropped a baby
from my innards

345
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,920
"and I was forced to leave it
right there in the hospital

346
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,920
"for financial reasons.
But go ahead,

347
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,920
"tell me what you had
for brunch the next day.

348
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,720
"You had waffles ?

349
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,120
You're incredible, Carol.
That's a great fucking story."

350
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,720
And, look,

351
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,920
I don't mean to suggest
that this is an issue

352
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,120
that only mothers
should have to think about.

353
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,040
Family leave should be thought of
as an option for both parents,

354
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,240
which will take
some cultural adjustment.

355
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,920
Look at Major League Baseball,
which offers all of three days off

356
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,040
to players who become fathers.

357
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,440
But when one of them,
the Mets' Daniel Murphy,

358
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,720
actually took it,
this happened.

359
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,680
This week, sports radio
skewered him

360
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,920
for missing the first two games
of the season for his son's birth.

361
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,680
You get your back to your team
and you play baseball.

362
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,920
That's my take on it.

363
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,080
What... there's nothing
you can do anyway.

364
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,800
You're not breastfeeding
the kid.

365
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,520
Always said, C-section
before the season starts.

366
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,320
I need to be at opening day.

367
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,120
Good luck selling that
to your wife.

368
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,520
"Uh, listen, babe,

369
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,640
"I know I play 162 games
in a season,

370
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,040
"but I can't miss
a single one,

371
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,040
"so let's cut that thing
out of your belly

372
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,760
"so I can wear
my baggy pajamas

373
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,560
and swing a cone of wood
to make a ball go far."

374
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,320
So why do we have this system
in the United States ?

375
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,320
Well, for a start, employers
tend to fear any sort of mandate.

376
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,320
But when it comes
to family leave,

377
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,760
any fears do tend
to be overblown.

378
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,080
Look at the way that lawmakers
discussed our current

379
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,200
12 weeks
of unpaid leave system

380
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,920
back when it was proposed
in 1993.

381
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,920
I want to make sure
that all of you

382
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,240
who will vote for this
have no illusions.

383
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,920
This bill will cost jobs.

384
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,920
Today, America's businesses
are already saddled

385
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,920
with too many suffocating
regulatory burdens.

386
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,920
Now is not the time

387
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,040
to shove restrictive
federal mandates

388
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,640
down the throats of American businesses
and American families.

389
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,680
This bill is unfair,
anti-business,

390
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,800
anti-growth, invasive,
deathly expensive...

391
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,760
"I say this to the House,

392
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,400
"if we allow new mothers
to take time off work,

393
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,720
"businesses shall crumble,
our cities shall burn,

394
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,320
"and hungry wolves
shall roam our streets.

395
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,520
"I'm not anti-Mom,
I'm anti-wolf !

396
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,840
"That's all I'm saying.
No to wolves !

397
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,840
"No to the wolves !

398
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,040
Think about the wolves !"

399
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,600
Now that bill
obviously passed,

400
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,040
and a 2012 survey
found few work sites

401
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,680
reported negative effects
of complying with the law.

402
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,680
So we thought
the bill would kill us,

403
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,000
but instead we just got used
to having it around,

404
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,000
like an irregular mole
or a new step-dad.

405
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,120
"I don't know why
I was so afraid of you, Gene.

406
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,160
You were fine."

407
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,280
Now, some people might argue,

408
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,640
"But that was unpaid leave.

409
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,920
Paid leave is too onerous."
But is it ?

410
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,920
Because back in 2002,
California passed a plan

411
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,360
providing six weeks
of partially-paid leave

412
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,400
funded through
a small payroll tax.

413
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,600
Essentially,
it was an insurance plan

414
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,000
that would cost employers
little to nothing.

415
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,360
But all the same
fear-mongering took place,

416
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,440
and in the end,
this happened.

417
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,040
More than 90%
of the companies there

418
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,920
reported either positive
or, at worst, neutral effect.

419
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,080
Businesses seemed
to just make it work.

420
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,320
And the polling data we have
when we survey them,

421
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,040
most of them say
it's just not a big deal.

422
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,640
Yeah, it seems paid maternity

423
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,160
is a bit like having hockey on
in the background at a bar.

424
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,960
It's not hurting anyone

425
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,960
and a couple of people
are actually really into it.

426
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,760
So, look, in California,
it worked.

427
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,840
And yet only two other states
have followed their lead.

428
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,920
And that may be because
any legislation

429
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,920
that specifically seeks
to support women

430
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,880
often faces vocal opposition.

431
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,920
In fact, Minnesota
recently debated a bill

432
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,840
which expanded unpaid
maternity leave

433
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,120
and provided other workplace
protections for women,

434
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,160
which seemed
like a slam-dunk.

435
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,360
After all, lawmakers love
their mothers in Minnesota.

436
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,400
Just look at these videos
they made.

437
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,000
Hi, Mom.
Happy Mother's Day.

438
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,800
Whether it's one day
or all year round,

439
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,840
frankly, we should be
thanking our moms.

440
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,160
Happy Mother's Day to all mothers
in Minnesota. And thank you.

441
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,160
Do I talk about my mom

442
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,080
or the mother of my children ?
I love them both.

443
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,000
She always said there's
two sides to every story.

444
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,560
You need to know them both before you
can be wise enough to know what to do.

445
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,160
Okay, just pump
the brakes a bit,

446
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,400
because moms are like feet.

447
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,120
The more you talk
about them in public,

448
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,920
the more everyone assumes you want to
have sex with them.

449
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,720
So just don't.

450
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,200
Still, it's... it is...
Don't think too much about that.

451
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,200
It is interesting that Representative
Dan Hall's mother

452
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,640
taught him that there's
two sides to every story.

453
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,200
Because you might
like to know that he

454
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,400
and every other lawmaker
you just saw

455
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,400
voted against that bill.

456
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,600
And you can't
have it both ways.

457
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,200
You can't go on and on about how much
you love mothers

458
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,200
and then fail
to support legislation

459
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,200
that makes life
easier for them.

460
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,040
In fact, until we...

461
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,360
Until we as a country
do something to address this,

462
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,240
this should be
the only message

463
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,560
that we're allowed to send
on Mother's Day.

464
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,960
Mothers.

465
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,280
We owe everything
to them.

466
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,920
They gave birth to us.
They nurtured us.

467
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,920
They made us who we are.

468
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,600
And this Mother's Day,
we have just one thing to say

469
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,800
to all the mothers out there.

470
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,920
Get the fuck back to work.

471
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,280
Seriously,
get back to work now.

472
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,640
Because unless
you can personally afford

473
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,760
to take the time off you want,
we're going to need you

474
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,760
to get your exhausted ass
back to work

475
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,600
and show us that can-do attitude
that moms are famous for.

476
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,240
We'd do anything
for our moms,

477
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,920
up to, but not including,

478
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,920
paying them to stay home
for a while

479
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,040
after pushing a human being
out of their body.

480
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,480
But we do want to say,
"Thank you."

481
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,960
And what better way
to thank us for thanking you

482
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,840
than maybe turning up
on time once in a while ?

483
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,000
We appreciate you, moms.

484
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,200
That's why we're happy
to allow you to bring

485
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,040
that weird doughnut cushion
to work,

486
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,720
just so long as you promise
not to tell us what it's for.

487
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,280
And if you need to find
a place to pump breast milk,

488
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,920
well, no problem.

489
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,120
Either use the break room,

490
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,840
or even better,
why not get some fresh air ?

491
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,960
You'll be more comfortable
out there.

492
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,920
It'll be like a picnic.

493
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,080
And, moms, you love picnics.

494
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,280
The important thing
is that you come back to work

495
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,800
when you're ready,
or when you're not ready,

496
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,920
or even when your placenta
is still technically inside you.

497
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,240
Oopsie.
Clean-up on aisle seven.

498
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,840
Look at you, super mom,

499
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,080
taking care of everyone.

500
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,920
Because remember, not only
can you balance work and family,

501
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,560
you have to.

502
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,560
And that's why
this Mother's Day,

503
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,560
we know you'll be grateful,
moms,

504
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,360
because you understand
that even though

505
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,840
183 other countries
do more for you,

506
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,920
we do as much
as we feel we can right now.

507
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,520
What we're saying is,

508
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,120
you deserve
the very best, moms.

509
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
You're just not gonna get it.

510
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,800
Happy Mother's Day.

511
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,360
And finally tonight,
let's talk about Japan,

512
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,000
a nation so vibrant,
not even Sofia Coppola

513
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,040
and the band Air
could make it boring.

514
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,200
Japan, like every country,

515
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,320
has struggled
to engage its people

516
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,320
with government programs
and services.

517
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,640
That's why they've come up with a
quintessentially Japanese solution,

518
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,960
mascots.

519
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,920
These are mascot characters

520
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,200
created for local districts
throughout Japan

521
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,920
to promote the areas.

522
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,800
Apparently, there are now
over 1,500 such mascots.

523
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,920
1,500 mascots !

524
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,360
So if you're in Japan
and you throw a rock,

525
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,920
you'll probably hit one.

526
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,560
And you'll know it
when it happens

527
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,160
because you'll probably hear
an adorable squeaking sound.

528
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,040
And it's not just
local districts' tourism boards.

529
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,680
There are official mascots
for everything.

530
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,280
Some cities
have dozens of mascots.

531
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,320
This is Noruran,
a mascot for a train line.

532
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,000
And this is Katakkuri-chan,
the mascot

533
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,400
for a notorious
Japanese prison.

534
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,920
That's right.

535
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,640
Their prisons have mascots.

536
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,080
And you've got to admit,
The Shawshank Redemption

537
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,480
would be a very different movie
if every now and then

538
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,880
that thing was walking around
in the background.

539
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,520
That's a different film.

540
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,120
That's a very different film.

541
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,920
And the thing is,
mascots can be big business.

542
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,440
Just look at Kumamon,
one area's lovable bear mascot.

543
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,920
He has brought in
an estimated $1.2 billion

544
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,800
over two years.

545
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,960
And if you're wondering why,
take a look at this.

546
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,400
He loves Kumamoto a lot

547
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
That's it.

548
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,880
I am done interacting
with humans now.

549
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,760
If you ever want
to talk to me,

550
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,440
wear a Kumamon outfit
or get the fuck out.

551
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,520
And the thing, he's not even
the most popular.

552
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,360
That title goes
to Funassyi,

553
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,160
a giant genderless pear

554
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,760
representing the city
of Funabashi.

555
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,840
And not only does Funassyi
hold press conferences,

556
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,200
he does some pretty incredible
TV appearances.

557
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,400
Let me show you just one.

558
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,480
I don't know...

559
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,280
I don't know why anyone
is still watching this show

560
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,080
or any other show now that they know
that that video exists somewhere.

561
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,240
Mascots have become
such a feature

562
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,360
of political life in Japan
that foreign embassies

563
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,760
are even being compelled
to play along.

564
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,920
The Israeli embassy in Japan

565
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,560
has unveiled its new mascot
to the public,

566
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,080
a parrot holding
an olive branch named Shaloum-chan.

567
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,720
I believe some Japanese will see Israel
like this character.

568
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:04,200
Look, people see Israel
a lot of different ways.

569
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,400
But I don't think
there is anyone on Earth

570
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,760
that sees it
as that character.

571
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,760
But that just proves
the power

572
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,320
mascots have to reach out
and engage people.

573
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,280
Although, not all
are instantaneously lovable.

574
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,080
For example,
the prefecture of Nara

575
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,920
is represented by Sento-kun,

576
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,560
a shirtless boy creature
with antlers on his head

577
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,360
who looks like the result
of Andre Agassi fucking a reindeer.

578
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,160
Or there's the objectively
terrifying Melon Kuma,

579
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,920
an angry bear
with a melon for a head

580
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,640
who represents Yubari.

581
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,920
Now let's watch
a local school visit

582
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,520
going exactly how
you'd imagine it would.

583
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,360
What did they think
was going to happen ?

584
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,960
It's got bloody teeth
and a melon for a head !

585
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,760
The problem is,

586
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,880
the sheer scale of publicly-funded
mascots has become a problem.

587
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,080
Last year,
the Japanese Finance Ministry

588
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,160
tried to crack down on them,
describing some

589
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,960
as a waste of public funds,
which is ridiculous.

590
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,360
Because not only should Japan
not be cutting back,

591
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,360
we, in America, should be
creating our own mascots

592
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,360
to engage people
with government agencies.

593
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,360
In fact, I'll do some
for you right now.

594
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,360
If you want the embodiment
of justice,

595
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,000
forget about that boring
blindfolded lady.

596
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,400
Let me introduce you
to Scales The Blind Iguana.

597
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,400
You need someone to make Immigration
and Customs Enforcement

598
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,000
a bit friendlier ? Well, meet Hamilton,
The Pig In A Sailor Hat.

599
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,400
Look out,
he's coming to de-pork you.

600
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,920
And, you know, for the Department
of Health and Human Services,

601
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,360
you could have, I don't know,
a creepy baby doll

602
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,640
with Hulk hands
wearing a tutu.

603
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,000
To be fair, that is no weirder
than most Japanese mascots,

604
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,840
and it's just as memorable.

605
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,840
And, look,
I know what you're thinking.

606
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,040
You're thinking, "John,
this is all very well,

607
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,640
"but the Japanese put their money
where their mouth is

608
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,240
and they make these mascots."

609
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,040
Well, let me ask you this.

610
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,840
Have we ever
let you down before ?

611
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,920
We have made mascots

612
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,240
for 11 government agencies.

613
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,040
Would you like
to meet them all ?

614
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,920
I can't hear you.

615
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,040
Would you like
to meet them all ?

616
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,840
Let's do this !
Dim the lights !

617
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,040
Ladies and gentlemen,

618
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,920
please welcome
your 2015 government agencies.

619
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,160
From the Department
of Justice, Scales The Blind Iguana !

620
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,960
From Immigration
and Customs Enforcement,

621
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,920
Hamilton The Pig !

622
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,360
And of course,
from the HHS,

623
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,920
Creepy Baby With Hulk Hands
In A Tutu !

624
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,640
Oh, but ladies and gentlemen,

625
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,720
we're just getting started.

626
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,560
From the Department
of Transportation,

627
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,360
please welcome Stunk
The Steampunk Skunk !

628
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,360
She loves trains !

629
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,160
And from the National
Security Agency,

630
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,920
it's Hoots The NSA Owl !

631
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,320
He just wants to know
"hooo" you've been talking to.

632
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,920
From the TSA,
it's Spike The Hedgehog,

633
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,560
who collects
four-ounce bottles of shampoo

634
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,360
and Swiss Army knives.

635
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,560
Spike, did you need
to take all those ?

636
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,560
I can't stay mad
at you, Spike.

637
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,920
And next, from
the Department of Energy,

638
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,680
Ram Jam The Dancing Ram !

639
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,760
He's got so much energy,
he never stops dancing !

640
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,560
How's it going there,
Ram Jam ?

641
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,960
How's it going ?

642
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,520
Of course it's going well.
He loves it.

643
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,320
And don't think
we've forgotten about

644
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,960
the Department
of Agriculture or NASA.

645
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:54,920
We've got a soybean
and a space gecko just for them.

646
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,920
Plus, representing
the Bureau of Alcohol,

647
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,760
Tobacco, Firearms,
and Explosives,

648
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,880
here is acclaimed
character actor Bob Balaban !

649
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,280
And finally,

650
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,120
from the Dep...
He's actually here.

651
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,120
And finally, from the Department
of the Treasury,

652
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,120
please say hi to Cornelius,
The Illuminati Pyramid !

653
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,520
It has an eyeball
at the top of it.

654
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,920
So that's it.

655
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,200
This is your 2015
government agencies !

656
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,480
Look at them dance !

657
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,480
Look at them dance,
America !

658
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,600
You cannot be apathetic

659
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,800
about what
you're looking at here.

660
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,960
If you don't feel
the importance

661
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,080
of government
agencies right now,

662
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,240
I just don't think
I can help you.

663
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,920
That's our show.

664
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,200
Good night.
Join us next week.

665
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,480
Farewell !

666
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,440
Let's rock.

667
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,440
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

668
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,960
Season 2
End of episode 13
