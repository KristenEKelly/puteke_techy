LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,000
Series II
Episode 33

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,880
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

4
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,000
Thank you so much for joining us.
I'm John Oliver.

5
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,840
Just time for
a quick recap of the week.

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,200
And we begin with the UK,
Earth's least Magic Kingdom.

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,920
This week, debate
has been raging over there

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,320
over a controversial new law.

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,680
The British government is unveiling
new surveillance laws

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,280
that significantly extends its power
to monitor people's activities online.

11
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,920
Theresa May there calls it
"a license to operate."

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,400
Others have called it a "Snooper's
Charter," haven't they ?

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,320
Well, hold on, because "Snooper's
Charter" is not the right phrase.

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,120
That sounds like the agreement an
eight-year-old is forced to sign

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,400
promising to knock before he enters
his parents' bedroom.

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,920
Dexter, sign this Snooper's Charter,

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,960
or we cannot be held responsible
for what you might see.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,920
This bill could potentially
write into law

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,120
a huge invasion of privacy.

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,840
Under the plans, a list of websites
visited by every person in the UK

21
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,640
will be recorded for a year

22
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,760
and could be made available to police
and security services.

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,440
This communications data
wouldn't reveal

24
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,920
the exact web page you looked at,
it would show the site it was on.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,560
Okay, so it wouldn't store the exact
page, just the website.

26
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,920
But that is still
a lot of information.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,480
For instance,
if someone visited Orbitz.com,

28
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,560
you'd know they were
thinking about taking a trip.

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,640
If they visited Yahoo.com,

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,200
you'd know they just had a stroke and
forgot the word "Google."

31
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,160
And if they visited vigvoovs.com,

32
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,920
you'd know they're horny
and their B-key doesn't work.

33
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,920
And yet, for all the sweeping powers
the bill contains,

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,160
British Home Secretary
Theresa May insists

35
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,280
that critics have
blown it out of proportion.

36
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,840
An Internet connection record
is a record

37
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,920
of the communication service
that a person has used,

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,920
not a record of every
web page they have accessed.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,720
It is simply the modern equivalent
of an itemized phone bill.

40
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,240
But that's not quite as reassuring as
she thinks it is, I'll tell you why.

41
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,640
First, I don't want the government
looking at my phone calls either.

42
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,120
And secondly,
an Internet browsing history

43
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,040
is a little different
from an itemized phone bill.

44
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,880
No one frantically deletes their phone
bill every time they finish a call.

45
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,360
So, let's move on to veterans,

46
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,400
the only people on Earth who can pull
off a camo jacket...

47
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,800
Gwyneth.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,200
Wednesday...
Wednesday is Veterans Day,

49
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,480
a chance for Americans around the
country to salute those who've served.

50
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,920
Although, if you've watched any
sporting event in the past few years,

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,360
you could be excused for thinking
every day is Veterans Day.

52
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,800
The roar of a military flyover is the
highlight of NFL pre-game activities.

53
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,280
Then the Padres take
the field in their camo uni.

54
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,920
Pre-game, a full field flag
was unveiled

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,600
in honor of our troops.

56
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,000
A tribute to those
who protect our way of life.

57
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,480
There is Dad, home from Korea.

58
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,680
Here's your moment that makes you
proud to be an American.

59
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,920
Please direct your attention
high above the scoreboard

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,760
and welcome Sergeant
First Class Richard Babineau

61
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,080
as he rappels down
from the arena catwalk

62
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,880
for tonight's ceremonial puck drop.

63
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,240
Holy shit !
That is awesome !

64
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,600
Although, quick tip to the NHL,

65
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,600
maybe don't lead off your festivities

66
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,040
with something objectively cooler than
the product you're presenting.

67
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,520
Hope you enjoyed an American hero
flying through the air.

68
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,160
Now for your main event:
12 bearded Russians engage

69
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,000
in full-contact figure skating
while trying to whack a flat ball.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,640
Unfortunately though,

71
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,920
it turns out while some military
tributes were for the right reasons,

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,320
others may have been
a little more self-serving.

73
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,920
You know those moments when
you see a military member

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,360
sing the national anthem or carry out
the American flag at a game ?

75
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,640
Well, an unprecedented
congressional review has found

76
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,880
those moments are often actually paid
for by the Department of Defense.

77
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,440
Investigations show
that as many as 72 contracts

78
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,680
were in place with up to
50 pro sports teams.

79
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,800
That's right. This week
we learned the full extent

80
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,160
of how the US military had been
quietly paying sports teams

81
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,360
in exchange for seemingly
genuine emotional moments

82
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,920
a phenomenon usually reserved
for the Girlfriend Experience section

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,160
of Craigslist Casual Encounters.

84
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,040
And the details of some
of these deals are amazing.

85
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,240
The Air Force paid
the Dallas Mavericks

86
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,640
$5,000 for a package that included

87
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,400
throwing out T-shirts that
the Air Force itself provided.

88
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,920
The National Guard paid the Atlanta
Falcons to recognize its birthday,

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,920
and that is so sad.

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,520
That's what a mom does for her
socially inept third-grader.

91
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,920
Listen, if you come to Gregory's party
for 45 minutes,

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,400
I'll get you an Xbox One,

93
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,000
but you have to talk to him and you
cannot deny you came.

94
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,920
Now, the response to this story from
the leagues has been unimpressive.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,080
NFL Commissioner
Roger Goodell promised,

96
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,760
if they find any inappropriate
payments were made,

97
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,280
they will be refunded in full.

98
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,600
And the commissioner of Major League
Baseball claimed,

99
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,320
the teams didn't always collect the
money in the contract,

100
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,040
and even when they did,

101
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,400
there was some important context we
should all bear in mind.

102
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,440
I think that our clubs, for the
minuscule amount of money involved,

103
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,040
it's just not material
to their business.

104
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,080
I think that the amount of things that
we do free for the military,

105
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,920
hundreds and hundreds of fold,
makes up

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,320
for whatever small payments are
involved in these contracts.

107
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,680
No, it doesn't.
And you just made this even grosser.

108
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,000
You're basically saying, maybe
we did take your money,

109
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,600
but we're so rich,
we didn't even need it.

110
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,200
And besides, we've done
so much for veterans,

111
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,040
a little thank you for your service
would be nice for a change.

112
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,720
And finally tonight,
staying in the world of sport,

113
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,080
the Washington Redskins,

114
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,320
amazingly, only the 19th most
indefensible thing about the NFL.

115
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,000
You may remember back in July,

116
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,840
a federal judge upheld a decision
by the US Patent Office

117
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,960
to cancel the Redskins'
trademark protection,

118
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,920
ruling that it does not extend to
names that may disparage people.

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,960
Well, last Friday,
the team fired back.

120
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,800
The team is defending its name
with an interesting tactic,

121
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,600
listing out the companies
with offensive names

122
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,480
that the government has approved.

123
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,080
Here on 8 News, we will not be listing
out those names,

124
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,880
because they are, indeed, offensive.

125
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,920
Okay, okay. That's fine.
That's understandable.

126
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,360
However, here on HBO,
we have no such restrictions,

127
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,640
so we will be reading
the names out in full.

128
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,880
Because, and I'll tell you why,

129
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,080
in a bid to show the Patent Office's
double standards,

130
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,920
the Redskins actually pointed,
in their legal brief,

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,920
to approved trademarks such as,

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,960
Slutsseeker dating services,

133
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,520
Capitalism Sucks Donkey Balls,

134
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,920
and Hot Octopuss anti-premature
ejaculation creams.

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,520
The team also cited

136
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,760
Edible Crotchless Gummy Panties,

137
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,720
Dick Balls,
and Klitoris with a K.

138
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,920
I could go on, so I will.

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,400
They also pointed to MILF Weed,

140
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,360
Make Your Own Dildo,

141
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,720
and Laughing My Vagina Off.

142
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,840
I could stop, but I won't.

143
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,360
Because they also mentioned
Party With Sluts,

144
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,040
Anal Fantasy Collection,
and Jizz Underwear.

145
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,560
Oh, sorry, I forgot to mention,
if you have children in the room,

146
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,920
they should have left before
the previous 30 seconds.

147
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,480
Now, the Redskins maintain
that their legal argument here

148
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,280
is actually quite simple.

149
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,360
The Washington Redskins
want to know

150
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,240
why their trademark is different.

151
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,760
The Redskins say that more than three
million trademarks have been issued

152
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,480
and not one of them ever
cancelled for being offensive.

153
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,400
Okay, you know what,
that might be a fair point.

154
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,680
Although, for the record,

155
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,040
that means the Redskins' moral defence
is now essentially,

156
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,880
Hey, our name
is no worse than that of

157
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,680
and again, this is another real
trademark cited in their case,

158
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,240
"the Shank the Bitch board game,"

159
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,320
which I'm guessing had
to be trademarked

160
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,080
to distinguish it from the Shank the
Bitch breakfast cereal,

161
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,880
and Nancy Meyers' "Shank the Bitch,"
the motion picture.

162
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,960
But maybe the most obnoxious part

163
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,800
of the Redskins' entire 82-page appeal
is when they argued...

164
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,480
Just about everything is potentially
disparaging to someone.

165
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,440
Because A, no it isn't,

166
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,920
and B, that's not the fucking point.

167
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,320
The word Redskins isn't "potentially"
disparaging to "someone."

168
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,080
It is "currently" disparaging
to specific individuals,

169
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,160
no matter how often you try to deny it
by saying things like this.

170
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,320
The Redskins have long said

171
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,280
the name is intended to honor Native
Americans, not insult them.

172
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,440
Look, if I may talk to Redskins' owner
Dan Snyder for a moment.

173
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,840
Intending to honor something is a lot
different from actually honoring it.

174
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,280
Although, since you seem
to feel differently,

175
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,200
let me suggest that everyone
now honor Dan Snyder

176
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,720
by renaming their fantasy
football teams...

177
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,880
Dan Snyder is a thin-skinned racist
whose sunglasses look like

178
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,320
something a tacky paedophile
might settle for.

179
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,600
And hey, hey, Dan, don't get upset.

180
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,240
Everything is potentially
disparaging to somebody.

181
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,720
And now, this.

182
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,920
And now, everybody wants to be
an outsider.

183
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,720
There's a big appetite for outsiders.

184
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,040
That used to be what they said about
you when you came in.

185
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,800
They still do. You just have to
listen, they still do.

186
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,640
US senator for four years.
Not an outsider

187
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,240
It's time to get someone
who's an outsider.

188
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,000
US senator for 12 years.
Also not an outsider.

189
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,480
I wake up every morning
as an outsider.

190
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,240
You wake up every morning as a
governor,

191
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,240
and have for the last five
years. Not an outsider.

192
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,960
Well, I can't think of
anything more of an outsider

193
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,720
than electing
the first woman president.

194
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,680
First lady for 8 years.
US senator for 8 years.

195
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,000
Secretary of state for four years.
Not an outsider.

196
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,480
Are you a plausible outsider ?

197
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,160
Yeah, I haven't been
in Washington D.C.

198
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,440
I wouldn't know how to drive.

199
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,040
I can barely get from Dulles
to Senator Grassley's office.

200
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,760
Are you fucking kidding me?

201
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,880
I'm very much outside the box.

202
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,040
OK, that's true. True, true, true.

203
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,240
Moving on.
Now, this year...

204
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,160
This year we've covered many
depressing aspects

205
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,840
of our criminal
justice system,

206
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,560
from how mandatory minimum sentencing
has crowded our prisons,

207
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,280
to how bail punishes the poor,

208
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,360
to how overstretched public defenders
threaten your right to a fair trial,

209
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,040
to how small municipal violations

210
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,920
can wind up putting you
in the fuck barrel.

211
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,440
And, fun fact:

212
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,720
If you binge-watch
those episodes in order,

213
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,680
you are entitled to an ice cream cone
at Dairy Queen.

214
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,600
So, congratulations, enjoy it.

215
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,200
You have earned it.

216
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,200
Just to be clear, it's not free,

217
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,320
and Dairy Queen is not
involved in any capacity.

218
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,760
The point is, though,

219
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,080
after learning about
our shattered justice system,

220
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,240
you've frankly earned the right to eat
your feelings

221
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,920
with a Peanut Buster Parfait,

222
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,640
the only frozen treat in America with
"nut buster" as part of its name.

223
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,800
Anyway, tonight, instead of talking
about how people wind up in prison,

224
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,640
I thought we'd talk
about how they leave,

225
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,920
a process known as prison re-entry.

226
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,520
It's particularly relevant this week

227
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,840
in light of what happened
just last weekend.

228
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,640
The largest one-time release of
federal prisoners in history

229
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,920
is getting underway today.

230
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,880
The move is in response to a loosening
of mandatory minimum sentences

231
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,880
for nonviolent drug offenders.

232
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,800
About 6,000 prisoners
are being set free today.

233
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,920
Yes, 6,000 mostly low-level drug
offenders were released last week,

234
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,160
and if you are one of them,
let me bring you up to speed

235
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,360
on what you may have missed
since you've been inside.

236
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,400
Uber's replaced cabs,
everyone pretends to like kale now,

237
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,520
Matthew McConaughey has an Oscar,
and in four states pot is legal,

238
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,920
which, for some of you, must seem like
a cruel, cruel irony.

239
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,960
Now, unsurprisingly,

240
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,880
this news was not exactly
welcomed by everyone.

241
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,800
When you release people like that,
you'll have an increase in crime.

242
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,160
Okay. No doubt in my mind.

243
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,520
Some believe the prisoner
release is a racial deal

244
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,200
that will put Americans in jeopardy.

245
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,000
It's part of an effort
to reduce prison overcrowding.

246
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,800
But who exactly are these prisoners ?
Are they dangerous ?

247
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,920
Yes, are they dangerous ?

248
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,160
Is this the purge ? Is it happening ?

249
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,600
Is this the pur..

250
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,440
Do I need to buy a mask, or will one
be provided for me ?

251
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,720
I don't know how the purge works.

252
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,440
Now, to be clear, by and large,

253
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,360
these prisoners were going to be
released in a couple of years anyway.

254
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,600
So, people are essentially
freaking out about something

255
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,560
that had it happened two years later,
they wouldn't even have noticed.

256
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,400
And it's also worth noting
that more than 600,000 people

257
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,920
get released from state and federal
prisons every year.

258
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,640
So, 6,000 more would represent an
increase of less than one percent.

259
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,920
And the only time anyone actually
notices a change that small

260
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,040
is your dad with the thermostat.

261
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,920
And hey, when you have your own place,
you can heat it like the tropics,

262
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,960
but not while he's paying the bills.

263
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,280
You're burning money !

264
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,400
Unfortunately,
we have a lot of misconceptions

265
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,760
about what leaving prison
is actually like.

266
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,200
Perhaps because it's often presented
in movies and TV as a happy moment,

267
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,480
when former inmates
rejoin families and friends

268
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,320
and put their life back together.

269
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,360
I'm free !

270
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,520
Free ! Oh, Lord !
I never thought I'd get out.

271
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,840
That's a good hug. That's a good hug.

272
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,200
What was important is
that we cut a deal,

273
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,120
and Kenny was finally free.

274
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,600
Patrick !

275
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,920
SpongeBob !

276
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,920
That's so nice.

277
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,240
Although, the last scene
was slightly undercut

278
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,880
when Patrick the starfish realized

279
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,560
SpongeBob had joined the Aryan
Brotherhood while inside.

280
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,400
Hey, hey ! He did what he had to do !

281
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,920
He did what he had to do !

282
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,920
But the sad truth is

283
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,480
for a surprisingly high
number of prisoners,

284
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,960
their time on the outside
may be brief.

285
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,920
The national average
of recidivism is 50%.

286
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,920
So, we're spending 80 billion dollars
and failing half the time, right ?

287
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,200
That doesn't make any sense.

288
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,360
No, it doesn't make any sense.

289
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,600
The only thing we're allowed to throw
billions at just to fail half the time

290
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,040
is this man, vandalized Urban
Outfitters mannequin, Johnny Depp.

291
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,600
The fact that around half
of people who leave prison

292
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,480
end up going back is horrifying.

293
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,840
But when you look
at the challenges they face,

294
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,720
it gets a little less surprising.

295
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,400
In fact, let me walk you through

296
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,120
what's it's like
when you get out of prison.

297
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,320
And let's just start with minute one.

298
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,640
Because when inmates exit that gate to
start a new life,

299
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,920
they could find themselves
in the middle of nowhere

300
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,920
with little to nothing
in their pockets.

301
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,960
And the lucky ones might get enough
for a bus ticket and a meal,

302
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,480
but even exonerated
prisoners like Glenn Ford

303
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,440
can walk out with little to build
a life on.

304
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,160
Glenn Ford was given a $20 gift card
the day he left Angola Prison.

305
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,360
Gave me the card for $20
and said, "Wish you luck."

306
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,960
How long did that last you ?

307
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,240
One meal.

308
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,800
I had some fried chicken, tea,
and the French fries came with it.

309
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,720
I had four dollars and change left.

310
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,640
A $20 gift card.

311
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,720
If you're exonerated, you should
probably be leaving prison

312
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,360
with more than you take home after a
disappointing office Secret Santa.

313
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,440
And hey, don't act surprised
that that gift was terrible.

314
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,400
Your name got picked
by Janice from accounting,

315
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,800
and you know she don't give a fuck.

316
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,920
She don't give a fuck about you.

317
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,920
And look, once your money runs out,

318
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,040
you can find yourself
hungry and desperate.

319
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,320
Because in many states anyone
with felony drug convictions

320
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,640
can be banned
from government food benefits.

321
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,960
And if your family
lives in public housing,

322
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,920
you may not be able to return home.

323
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,680
Because some places require tenants
to sign papers

324
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,600
banning relatives with convictions
from entering their homes.

325
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,760
And while those rules
may have been written

326
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,560
to reduce crime in public housing,

327
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,320
they're administered so broadly it can
lead to situations like this.

328
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,640
Geraldine Miller signed the ban
after her son robbed a bodega at 16.

329
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,360
Had I'd known what I know today,
I would have never signed that paper.

330
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,560
Miller herself now
faces eviction

331
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,360
after her son was caught helping her
with groceries after she became ill.

332
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,120
She has to go to her brother's
apartment to see her son.

333
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,360
NYCHA want me to throw my son away.
I can't. I can't.

334
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,920
We all want people who've committed
crimes to learn their lesson,

335
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,760
but "never help your sick
mother with groceries"

336
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,600
sounds more like the kind of lesson
you'd learn

337
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,760
from a shitty Boyscout leader.

338
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,920
Hey, kids, never help your sick
mother with groceries,

339
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,480
always know where
the exits are in a dogfight,

340
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,680
and never pay a stripper up front.

341
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,320
Scouts dismissed.

342
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,400
And look, restricted
access to food and shelter

343
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,320
could be just the beginning
of your problems.

344
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,440
Depending on where you live,

345
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,680
a felony conviction can cut you off
from everything

346
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,080
from voting, to a driver's license,
and this is true

347
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,360
one Florida county's home
weatherization program.

348
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,920
So, I guess Florida is perfectly happy
to put people behind bars,

349
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,760
but they draw the line at putting them
behind storm windows and insulation.

350
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,520
While you could pay for food, shelter,
and weatherization with a job,

351
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,920
your opportunities to get one of those
might be severely limited.

352
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,400
There are state and local bans

353
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,440
preventing ex-felons from working
as everything

354
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,120
from a nurse to a septic tank cleaner,

355
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,920
to, in Mississippi,
an alligator rancher.

356
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,520
As if breaking into the alligator
ranching business

357
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,920
wasn't already hard enough as it is.

358
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,280
It's all who you know who's been eaten
by an alligator in that game.

359
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,120
And a criminal record can even make

360
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,760
getting an interview
for a job difficult.

361
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,880
Nearly every job application
will ask a potential employee

362
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,480
if he or she has ever been
convicted of a felony,

363
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,320
a question that, in some cases,

364
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,360
will automatically disqualify
you from getting hired.

365
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,240
It makes you a little uncomfortable.

366
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,280
You get that anxiety
when you get to that box.

367
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,160
It's like, wow,
how are they gonna judge me ?

368
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,800
Knowing that
I committed this crime.

369
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,520
How are they gonna feel about this ?

370
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,360
And it's understandable

371
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,680
that an employer might want to know if
an applicant has a criminal history,

372
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,000
but to have that question on a form
before you've even met the person

373
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,400
seems a little unfair.

374
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,440
They may have changed
significantly since then,

375
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,920
and you shouldn't judge someone on
what they may be most ashamed of.

376
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,920
Imagine if you had once
fucked a watermelon.

377
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,560
Maybe it happened 14 years ago.

378
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,920
You're not proud of it,
and you've changed since then.

379
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,920
If every job application you filled
out had this question on it

380
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,760
with no opportunity to give context of
how drunk you were,

381
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,920
or the fact that you haven't even
looked at a watermelon

382
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,760
for over a decade,

383
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,160
you'd begin to feel like the deck was
stacked against you.

384
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,280
And some states even acknowledge how
hard this process can be.

385
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,200
Ohio actually has a list
of job tips for ex-offenders

386
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,560
with dos and don'ts, such as...
Do be honest.

387
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,680
But if you're asked why
you left your last job,

388
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,920
don't use negative words
like "went to jail".

389
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,280
Instead do use terms like "relocated"
or "contract ended". Both are true.

390
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,920
And they are. And before you judge,
that is not a lie.

391
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,920
Everyone tries to present the most
flattering image of themselves.

392
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,720
You do it when you use a filter on an
Instagram photo of yourself.

393
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,520
Even the queen does it.
Because this is her official portrait,

394
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,880
but this is who she actually is.

395
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,000
But deep down, she knows you can't
put that face on money.

396
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,000
And all of this is before
we get to the difficulty

397
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,960
of ex-prisoners navigating parole.

398
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,200
Two-thirds of parolees
who go back to prison

399
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,000
do so not due to a new crime,

400
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,920
but because of parole violations,

401
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,400
sometimes for reasons as simple
as missing appointments

402
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,920
or failing a drug test.

403
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,840
And for some it may be because

404
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,440
they're dealing with untreated
substance abuse or mental illness,

405
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,440
but for others
who are trying their hardest,

406
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,040
satisfying the conditions of parole
can be maddeningly difficult.

407
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,760
Look at Bilal Chatman.

408
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,800
He spent a decade in prison
for a nonviolent drug offense

409
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,080
but despite the odds,

410
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,640
he managed to get his life back on
track and find a job that he loved.

411
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,080
Things were going well
until he hit a problem

412
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,440
regarding scheduling meetings
with his probation officer.

413
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,400
So, he got off, I think,
every day about 4:00,

414
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,520
and so my job didn't,
I didn't get off until 4:30.

415
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,920
I said, "Okay, well,
can I come in early ?"

416
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,920
Said "No, you can't come in early."

417
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,160
I said, "Well, okay. Well then, can I
come a little later ?

418
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,800
"Can I get there at like,
5:00 if you leave at 4:30 ?"

419
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,720
"I don't stay and wait for you. I'm
not gonna wait for you."

420
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,080
So, I don't wanna lose my job.

421
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,920
This is the thing
that I'm supposed to be doing.

422
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,360
This is what I'm out here for,

423
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,080
is I'm working to be a productive
member of society.

424
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,800
I felt set up.
I felt like I was set up to fail.

425
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,920
I felt most people in that situation
are set up to fail.

426
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,880
And you know what ?
It is hard to argue with that.

427
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,240
Because the only way Bilal could make
an appointment at 4:00,

428
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,080
if he left at 4:30,

429
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,720
would be if he somehow
owned a DeLorean, a TARDIS,

430
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,040
or whatever the fuck Jean-Claude Van
Damme used in "Timecop."

431
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,160
I can't remember. I think he travelled
through time by doing the splits.

432
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,840
It's been a while, but I think it was
a splits-based system.

433
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,880
Also, depending on where you live,

434
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,000
you might not just struggle
to meet your parole officer,

435
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,720
you might struggle to pay him.

436
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,880
Because in many states
you actually have to pay

437
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,880
for probation and parole service.

438
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,120
And in Pennsylvania they charge a $60
fee just to enter the program.

439
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,960
And if you don't have the money for
all the fees they charge,

440
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,920
as one Pennsylvania parolee explains,

441
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,560
you can be forced to make
a truly ridiculous choice.

442
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,760
You go to see your parole officer and
you don't have money ?

443
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
They will hold you.

444
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,080
Job or no job. And if you don't pay,
you come back to jail.

445
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,280
Yeah. I know one thing.

446
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,640
I found myself selling drugs
to pay back Pennsylvania.

447
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,880
Oh, my God.

448
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,440
So, in order to pay for the program to
keep him away from dealing drugs,

449
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,240
he has to earn money drug dealing.

450
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,920
At this point, the Pennsylvania
Department of Corrections

451
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
might as well change its motto to,
"Y'all come back now, y'hear ?"

452
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,200
By now, you may be wondering

453
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,720
who is responsible for
a system this broken.

454
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,000
Well, interestingly, the answer is
pretty much everybody.

455
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,720
Many of the obstacles you've seen
originated in the tough-on-crime '90s

456
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,520
with surprisingly little debate.

457
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,920
Remember the ban on ex-prisoners
from entering public housing

458
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,080
which forced Geraldine Miller
to kick out her son ?

459
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,240
Well, here's where that started.

460
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,840
From now on, the rule for residents
who commit crime and peddle drugs

461
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,600
should be one strike and you're out.

462
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,000
That is a State of the Union
standing ovation

463
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,640
from both sides.

464
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,840
Almost nothing gets a full room
ovation during those speeches,

465
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,760
with the exception of veterans, God,
and the speech being over.

466
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,480
In many cases, these laws were passed
with barely a second thought.

467
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,960
The 1996 law letting states restrict
food stamps for ex-drug felons.

468
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,440
was debated in the Senate
for all of three minutes.

469
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,240
I've been talking about this subject

470
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,080
for nearly five times longer
than they did

471
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,920
and I'm leaving a fuck
of a lot of stuff out.

472
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,400
Mainly because I had to make
time for "Timecop" references.

473
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,760
And  no one batted an eye when Bart
Gordon, a Democrat from Tennessee,

474
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,720
justified cutting off federal student
aid for prisoners with this logic.

475
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,920
Just because one blind hog may
occasionally find an acorn

476
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,160
doesn't mean many other
blind hogs will.

477
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,160
The same principle applies to giving
federal Pell Grants to prisoners.

478
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,200
First of all,
pigs find nuts by smell,

479
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:01,080
so a blind one is at no significant
disadvantage in an acorn hunt.

480
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,920
And second of all, people aren't pigs,
you fucking asshole !

481
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,680
And look, I know, I know...

482
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,920
it is not always easy

483
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,920
to care about the welfare
of ex-prisoners.

484
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,560
And some are going to re-offend no
matter what you do.

485
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,160
But the fact remains, over 95% of all
prisoners will eventually be released.

486
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,920
So, it's in everyone's interest

487
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,480
that we try to give them
a better chance at success.

488
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,840
Because under the current system,

489
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,360
if they do manage to overcome
all the obstacles we've set,

490
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,920
it's a minor miracle.

491
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,800
And one of the people who have managed
to beat those odds is Bilal Chatman.

492
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,640
I'm happy to say that he is still in
his job and he's still doing well.

493
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,080
And I'm even happy to say he's
actually with us this evening.

494
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,120
So, please welcome Bilal Chatman !

495
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,240
- Thanks a lot.
- Hi, Bilal.

496
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,320
Bilal Chatman, ladies and gentlemen.
Please, sit down.

497
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,840
Bilal, Bilal.

498
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,640
Thank you so much
for coming tonight.

499
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,720
I know that you were
not sure about doing this.

500
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,880
So, I wanna thank you
for being here.

501
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,920
Now, you managed to keep the job that
you were talking about in that clip.

502
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,360
And we saw the State of Ohio
giving advice to prisoners

503
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,920
about how to present their truth.

504
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,040
And when you were applying for jobs,

505
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,360
you listed your previous employer as:
What did you list ?

506
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,440
State of California.

507
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,160
The State of California. That's right.

508
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,920
That's technically true.

509
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
- Yeah, that is true. Yeah.
- That's true. That's true.

510
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,200
How is the job going ?

511
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,480
Absolutely fantastic. I couldn't have
scripted it another way,

512
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,040
any way better than what's going on.

513
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,920
I'm very excited I'm very fortunate
and blessed,

514
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,400
they've given me this opportunity.

515
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,960
And yes, I'm dedicated
to them. Absolutely wonderful.

516
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,200
I know that one of the reasons
you're nervous

517
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,720
is that because not everyone you work
for or with knows about the fact

518
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,240
that you were once in prison.

519
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,120
Now, you're going to work
tomorrow morning.

520
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,440
They may know by then. Yes.

521
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,560
So, what particularly are you most
worried about ?

522
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,400
I'm more worried about being judged
for what I used to be.

523
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,920
I'm not that same person.

524
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,280
You know, I've dedicated
myself, I've changed myself.

525
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,920
I'm no longer that person. You know ?

526
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,920
As time goes on, you become, you know,
I become a better person.

527
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,800
I worked really hard at the things
that I've taken from society.

528
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,920
And so, yeah.

529
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,320
So, what are the concerns,
though ? What they will think ?

530
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,800
Or how they might behave ?

531
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,720
What is the spectrum of circumstances
that you're concerned about ?

532
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,920
People are judgmental.
People that don't know. You know ?

533
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,800
I don't want anybody
to look at me as the ex-con.

534
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,800
I want them to look at me as the
person I am now.

535
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,320
I'm a supervisor.
You know, I'm a good employee.

536
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,160
I'm an employer.
I even hire and I fire.

537
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,520
So, I think they want to,

538
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,920
I want them to look at me as that and
continue to live with that.

539
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,880
They were about to both cheer and boo
you when you said that.

540
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,640
I guess that it's interesting
that you say that. Right ?

541
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,920
That you don't want to be defined by
something that you did so long ago.

542
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,640
'Cause we're probably guilty of giving
you a reductive term in that way.

543
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,760
'Cause we're having you on tonight as
Bilal the ex-prisoner.

544
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,920
Right.

545
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,560
Which is clearly not who you've been
for a long time.

546
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,560
Everyone has at least three
other things about them

547
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,040
that are interesting.

548
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,000
What three things about you
not related to that

549
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,840
would you like people to know ?

550
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,840
Well, I would like
people to know, you know.

551
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,640
Well, you know,
I grow tomatoes, you know.

552
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,920
Wait, wait. Wait, I'm gonna...

553
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,600
I'm gonna stop you... Yeah.

554
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,040
I'm gonna stop you
at number one there, Bilal.

555
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,640
'Cause that's a lot more interesting
than I think you think it is.

556
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,920
Yeah.

557
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,360
And I'm hoping that tomorrow,
your fellow workers

558
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,000
may choose, really, mainly to focus
on the fact

559
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,600
you grow tomatoes...

560
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,400
as being a more interesting
part of your life.

561
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,720
I know that one of the things
that's interesting

562
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,600
is that I know how hesitant you were
to do this.

563
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,160
As we talked to you through
the week...

564
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,280
as we even talked to you
today and tonight.

565
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:07,680
I guess a question would be, why did
you end up talking to us ?

566
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,360
Why are you here ?

567
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,000
I'm here because of the fact that, you
know, I may never do this again.

568
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,240
I've done other interviews.
I may never do this again

569
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,480
because this takes me back
to being that prisoner again.

570
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,920
I'm not that prisoner today.

571
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,920
I'm a taxpayer. You know, I work.

572
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,640
I'm a citizen. I'm a voter.

573
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,760
That's who I want to be. Those are the
things that have defined me today.

574
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,920
It's not what I did before. I did
things years ago that I'm ashamed of,

575
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,200
you know, that I don't like.

576
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,920
But I don't want to relive that.

577
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,520
I want this opportunity to be for
someone who says,

578
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,920
Oh, man, I can never get a chance.
I'll never have a chance.

579
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,880
There's always a chance.
You just keep going.

580
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,920
But I want the person, also,
that looks down at us

581
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,080
that maybe there's
a chance for other people too.

582
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,800
That's right.

583
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,960
Bilal, I can't thank you enough for
taking the time to be here.

584
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,120
Bilal Chatman, ladies and gentlemen,
the tomato grower !

585
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,920
Bilal the tomato grower !

586
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,680
That's our show.
Our thanks to Bilal Chatman.

587
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,000
We'll see you next week. Good night !

588
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,400
Thanks. Thanks, so much.

589
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,800
