LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,280
Season II,
Episode 26

3
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,960
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight" !
Thank you so much for joining us.

4
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,240
I'm John Oliver. Just time
for a quick recap of the week,

5
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,040
and we begin in North Korea,

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,680
named "Best Korea"
for 70 years running

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,760
by "North Korea Magazine".

8
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,080
This has been
a particularly tense week

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,960
on North Korea's
southern border.

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,040
New pictures to share with you.

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,080
The North Korean military
seemingly standing by,

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,760
ready to attack South Korea
if given the word.

13
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,160
Holy shit.
So, if given the word,

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,400
North and South Korea
could be at war.

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,760
And interestingly,
that word is Kookamunga.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,320
You cannot say Kim Jong-un
does not have a sense of humor.

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,080
You can't say it.

18
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,880
Now, both sides have exchanged fire
across the DMZ

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,960
and the South has been
employing an unusual weapon.

20
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,920
South Korean loudspeakers blaring
criticism

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,200
of North Korean leader
Kim Jong-un's regime.

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,840
The North has told
the South to turn it down

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,040
or face more military action.

24
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,600
Look, North Korea,

25
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,840
if your neighbor is blasting horrible
noise at all hours of the day,

26
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,320
you don't retaliate with war.

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,240
You leave a passive-aggressive note.

28
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,840
There is an etiquette
for how we handle this stuff.

29
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,760
The speakers have been blasting
not just news about Kim Jong-un,

30
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,840
but also, and this is true,
South Korean pop music.

31
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,480
They haven't said exactly
what music they've been playing,

32
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,000
but I hope it's some
of the better K-pop stuff.

33
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,320
I'm talking "Seoulight"
by Neon Bunny,

34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,080
basically anything
by Uhm Jung Hwa,

35
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,440
Jo Sung Mo's early stuff,

36
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,560
or maybe TVXQ, of course,
before Hero Jaejoong left,

37
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,680
'cause after that, the whole band's
sound went to shit.

38
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
I didn't need
to Google any of that.

39
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,720
That was all up here
and in here.

40
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,680
The two sides are
currently still negotiating

41
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,080
and we can only hope
that things calm down.

42
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,720
Nobody wants North Korea
firing a nuclear weapon.

43
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,920
And heaven help us all
if South Korea chooses to play this.

44
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,040
That was a hit
by Hwang Min-Woo.

45
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,120
Please, South Korea, do not play that
through your speakers.

46
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,520
That's not just
a declaration of war,

47
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,240
that's basically sarin gas
with backbeat and an Auto-Tune.

48
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,680
Let's move on to Russia,

49
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,600
the prequel and sequel
to the Soviet Union.

50
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,440
Over the years,

51
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,280
Vladimir Putin has launched
assaults on many things,

52
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,200
from Ukraine
to the concept of shirts

53
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,160
to unrubbed
puppy dog tummies.

54
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,320
That is real

55
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,680
and it is the most likable photo
Putin has ever taken,

56
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,680
and also the most unlikable photo
that dog has ever taken.

57
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,120
Recently, Putin has been focusing
on a new target.

58
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,440
Russian President Vladimir Putin
has declared a war on cheese.

59
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,840
After he issued
a presidential decree,

60
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,160
a mound of it was destroyed
by a bulldozer.

61
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,880
Authorities also incinerated
giant loads of bacon

62
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,440
and destroyed peaches
and tomatoes.

63
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,680
In all, hundreds of tons of food
have been eliminated recently

64
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,000
in Russia.

65
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,640
Okay, that's terrible.

66
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,440
That is a level of food destruction
not seen in Russia

67
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,440
since the 18th century reign
of Gallagher the Terrible.

68
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,160
And he was merciless.

69
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,840
Let me explain.

70
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,880
Putin has banned the import
of much Western food

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,520
in response to sanctions
over his behavior in Ukraine,

72
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,440
and he's clamping down
on any contraband.

73
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,920
Last week, officials
in the village of Apastovo

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,840
flattened three frozen geese
from a local shop.

75
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,400
Now, on one hand, it is shocking to see
that kind of massive food waste.

76
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,080
On the other hand,
geese can go fuck themselves.

77
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,480
And I'll tell you why. They are asshole
ducks who got really into CrossFit,

78
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,960
and they deserve
to be crushed with a tank.

79
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,040
I do not want
to argue about this.

80
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,840
Now, interestingly, while importing
certain Western products is a crime,

81
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,640
they can still show up
in stores,

82
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,840
which is why some Russian groups
are now using stickers

83
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,520
to warn people away
from any Western products.

84
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,600
This one says "sanctioned product",
and it has a picture

85
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,360
of the Stars and Stripes
of the United States,

86
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,320
the golden stars
of the European Union

87
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,160
and standing in front of them,
a Russian bear.

88
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,560
Russia, that is ridiculous,
and I'll tell you why.

89
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,160
Putting bears on food, does not make
people buy that food less.

90
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,600
It makes them buy it more.

91
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,760
Most of us only buy honey so we can
give a tiny bear a squeeze.

92
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,320
But unsurprisingly, with the Russian
economy struggling at the moment,

93
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,760
this destruction of food has not been
universally popular.

94
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,600
I believe it is possible to find
a better use for food,

95
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,200
rather than just burn it.

96
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,040
It would be better
to use it as humanitarian aid,

97
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,400
to collect it and send it
to those who need food.

98
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,360
Exactly. Somebody needs
to tell Putin

99
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,640
that destroying food
by making it inedible

100
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,680
does not make you a strong leader,
it makes you Guy Fieri.

101
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,920
So, just stop it.

102
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,400
And finally this week,
we turn to Greece,

103
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,640
the home of geniuses
like Socrates, Aristotle

104
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,800
and this guy in Mykonos with
an elephant trunk thong on his dick.

105
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,720
It's a vibrant country.

106
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,360
This has been a crazy year for
Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.

107
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,080
He was elected in January, promising
to end harsh austerity measures

108
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,880
but then capitulated in negotiations
with European banks

109
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,920
and agreed to extend them.
an idea that was so unpopular,

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,560
even he himself tried
to distance himself from it

111
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,800
when selling
the measures to parliament.

112
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,840
I will admit that the measures
we are tabling are harsh.

113
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,400
I don't believe they will
help the Greek economy,

114
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,160
and I say so openly,

115
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,920
but I also say that I must
implement them.

116
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,640
That is not
an inspirational tone to set.

117
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,040
You did not hear FDR selling
the New Deal by saying:

118
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,760
"Is this gonna work ?
Who the fuck knows ?"

119
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,040
"Probably not,
but it's definitely better"

120
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,120
"than me taking a shit in a typewriter,
my only other idea."

121
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,320
"So we're doing it.
We're doing this now."

122
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,160
Tsipras has been losing support,
even within his own party.

123
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,920
On Thursday he made
a surprise announcement.

124
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,360
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras
announced today he's resigning,

125
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,720
He says he has a moral duty
to allow the Greek people to judge

126
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,560
his brief and tumultuous time
as leader at the polls.

127
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,840
So, another election ?
You just had one in January.

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,440
Greece, you're not producing
seasons of "The Voice" !

129
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,920
So Sawyer Fredricks
is The Voice now ?

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,320
I was just getting used
to Craig Wayne Boyd as The Voice.

131
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,120
You're moving too fast, NBC !

132
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,040
Give me one The Voice
at a time !

133
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,080
Now, resigning just
seven months into office

134
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,960
might seem like a sign of weakness,
but some argue

135
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,080
this is a politically savvy move.

136
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,200
Tsipras has decided to go straight
to the nation

137
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,480
in an attempt to silence his rebels
and renew his mandate,

138
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,840
and it could work.

139
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,600
He'll be asking the Greek people
to re-elect him

140
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,960
before the effects of the new
bailout measures are truly felt.

141
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,800
That is brilliant.

142
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,960
Ask to be re-elected now
so that voters will be stuck with you

143
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,840
by the time they realize how terrible
you made their lives.

144
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,120
Tsipras, you've just pulled off

145
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,600
the electoral equivalent
of a Tom Cruise marriage proposal.

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,880
- "Will you marry me ?"
- "Yes."

147
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,320
"Now that you've agreed
to be mine forever,"

148
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,360
"let's discuss how Earth was colonized
with alien spirits"

149
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,920
"by the dictator
of a galactic confederacy."

150
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,400
"You said yes."

151
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,040
And now this.

152
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,240
Another check-in with the most
patient man on television.

153
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,920
When you want to vote Republican,

154
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,240
you take a chicken
to the doctor,

155
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,320
put an aspirin between
your knees

156
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,360
and pray for the country.

157
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,640
Obama's an idiot.

158
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,560
The only thing that Obama's
got going for him

159
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,280
is that he's got a bunch
of idiots that listen to him

160
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,720
and believe his same old
Nazi commie crap.

161
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,200
We've got to stand up
and say enough.

162
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,400
It's just a bunch of crap.

163
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,240
Bunch of crap,
if you ask me.

164
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,080
Just a bunch of leftist garbage.

165
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,120
The Democrats included are scum.

166
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,520
Pleasant scum,
but scum nevertheless.

167
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,160
- Hi, am I on the air ?
- You sure are.

168
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,440
Fuck !

169
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,400
We'll go to Greg in Spruce Pine,
North Carolina.

170
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,160
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns progress.

171
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,240
It's the reason that your grandparents'
views are better not spoken in public.

172
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,680
"Why did I bring you to 'Straight Outta
Compton', Papa ?"

173
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,320
"This is partly on me."

174
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,440
In the recent Republican
presidential debate,

175
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,480
there was a genuinely
encouraging sign.

176
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,560
The subject
of gay marriage came up

177
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,840
and presidential candidate John Kasich
responded like this.

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,400
Guess what ? I just went
to a wedding of a friend of mine

179
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,960
who happens to be gay.

180
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,000
Because somebody doesn't
think the way I do,

181
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,760
doesn't mean that I can't care
about them or can't love them.

182
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,520
A gay wedding just got applause
at a Republican debate.

183
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,720
Add that to the list of things that
would've been unthinkable in 2004,

184
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,400
like the phrase "Academy Award Winner
Matthew McConaughey".

185
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,240
People would've said
you were insane.

186
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,920
And look,
it's not just Kasich.

187
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,400
Jeb Bush, Rick Perry,
Bobby Jindal and Marco Rubio

188
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,640
have all said they would attend
a gay wedding if invited,

189
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,000
which I can only imagine
is terrible news

190
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,080
for any of their
gay acquaintances who invited them

191
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,040
only on the assumption that
they would decline to attend

192
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,360
and send a very expensive
gift instead.

193
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,680
"Well, I didn't think he would say yes,
did I, Mark ?"

194
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,880
"Now, which of your friends wants
to sit with Bobby Jindal ?"

195
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,400
"Yes, your friends.
I like my friends."

196
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,200
Not all of the candidates
have been quite so clear.

197
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,080
Governor Scott Walker,
for instance,

198
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,360
had a much more
squirrelly response.

199
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,120
Would you attend
a gay wedding ?

200
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,920
That's certainly a personal issue.
For a family member,

201
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,640
me and Tonette went
to a reception.

202
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,080
I haven't been to a wedding, but...

203
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,920
But I think marriage is defined
between a man and a woman

204
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,840
and I support the Constitution.

205
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,200
But we've been at a reception.

206
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,120
What ?

207
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,360
It's a yes or no question.

208
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,920
How the hell did you respond
on the RSVP card

209
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,320
when asked
if you wanted chicken or fish ?

210
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,440
"That's certainly
a personal question for dinner."

211
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,120
"Tonette and I already had chicken
at a restaurant,"

212
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,520
"last week I believe. I haven't had
fish recently, though."

213
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,160
"I still believe it is certainly a meal,
which is my position."

214
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,720
"Although, according to the menu,
there is a vegetarian option."

215
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,120
"To answer your question,
I have eaten chicken in the past."

216
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:43,720
While the idea of a gay wedding
is increasingly widely accepted,

217
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,400
it is worth noting that there are still
a number of surprising ways

218
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,200
to ruin a gay honeymoon.

219
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,120
Today, in most states an LGBT person
can get married on Saturday,

220
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,440
post photos of their wedding
on Sunday

221
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,880
and get fired from their job or thrown
out of their apartment on Monday

222
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,800
just because of who they are.

223
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,880
That's clearly terrible.

224
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,080
The only possible reason
you should be fired from your job

225
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,640
after your wedding is if your theme
was stolen office supplies.

226
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,280
That's the only logical reason.

227
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,040
But it is true that discriminating
against gay people

228
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,640
is surprisingly legal
in much of the country.

229
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,960
The fact is, in 31 states,

230
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,720
people are at risk
of being fired, evicted

231
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,360
or refused service just
because they're gay.

232
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,880
So, while federal law may guarantee
a gay couple's right to get married,

233
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,840
it offers exactly zero guarantees
about their right to do the things

234
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,040
that follow that, like signing a lease
on an apartment they can't afford,

235
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,560
conducting tense discussions
about finances

236
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,280
in the brightly lit tapas restaurant
of their choosing

237
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,120
or applying
for a small business loan

238
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,720
to get Brenda's stupid
cupcakes-for-dogs idea off the ground.

239
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,760
Brenda, all cupcakes
are cupcakes for dogs !

240
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,760
They eat
their own shit, Brenda,

241
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,720
which is just as well,
'cause your cupcakes are terrible.

242
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
They're terrible, B !

243
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,080
If you are surprised by this,

244
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,080
don't worry. You're not alone.

245
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,200
A 2013 poll showed
that nearly 70% of people thought

246
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,480
it was illegal under federal law

247
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,400
for someone to be fired
for being gay.

248
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,480
People believe it because it feels
like it should be true.

249
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,400
It's optimistic
but wrong,

250
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,040
like thinking vertical stripes
are flattering

251
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,400
or making your first
condom purchase Magnums.

252
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,640
Optimistic,
but statistically wrong.

253
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,480
There are plenty of recent
real-life examples of discrimination.

254
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,040
Look at Collin Dewberry
and Kelly Williams,

255
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,040
a Texas couple who visited
a restaurant called Big Earl's,

256
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,480
where the waitress
had something to say to them.

257
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:49,200
She said:
"We don't serve fags here."

258
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,560
Then the waitress continued, they say.

259
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,360
"Here at Big Earl's, we like for men
to act like men,"

260
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,200
"and for ladies to act like ladies."

261
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,320
And it was just
so nonchalantly,

262
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,320
almost like she was reading
a piece of paper.

263
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,440
She was. That phrase is posted
on the front door of the restaurant.

264
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,080
She's a young lady,
didn't know what else to say

265
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,000
And they just kept on,
so she finally said:

266
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,280
"We just don't like fags."

267
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,320
Okay, that is
obviously appalling,

268
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,240
and also, someone might
want to tell Big Earl

269
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,320
that having a sign saying,
"where men act like men"

270
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,480
is actually the single
gayest thing imaginable.

271
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,000
That's an example of discrimination
regarding public accommodation.

272
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,440
For discrimination in the workplace,
take the case of Casey Stegall,

273
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,320
a gay man employed as a children's
social services worker in Texas.

274
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,760
His fiancé showed up
to help him one day

275
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,280
because he needed help
with overseeing a field trip.

276
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,880
And the next thing he knew,
this happened.

277
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,280
Later in that week,

278
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,360
I got a text message from the president
of Children's Home,

279
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,280
saying I needed to come
meet with him.

280
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,640
He told me, because
of my lifestyle choices,

281
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,480
he didn't feel comfortable
having me on his team anymore.

282
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,680
For the record, being gay
is clearly not a lifestyle choice.

283
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,120
A lifestyle choice is when a man
gets obnoxiously into jazz

284
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,760
or goes on an Atkins diet

285
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,800
and starts a food blog
called "Protein Wolf".

286
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,800
Both of which you should
actually be fired for,

287
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,240
but that's not what we're talking
about tonight.

288
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,000
The fact is, this kind of discrimination
can have ripple effects,

289
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,480
like when this Michigan couple
had their pediatrician refuse

290
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,320
to treat their baby
because they were lesbians,

291
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,800
which, as they point out,
is crazy.

292
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,080
She's your patient. Your job is to keep
babies healthy,

293
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,120
and you can't keep a baby healthy
that has gay parents ?

294
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,160
Exactly, but to be fair,
no one can keep any baby healthy,

295
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,760
regardless of the parents.

296
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,880
Babies are
fleshy bacteria magnets.

297
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,120
They're basically
vomit volcanoes.

298
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,840
They're going to get sick
and they're going to make you sick.

299
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,720
But it is amazing that stories like this
are still taking place.

300
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,840
This may not be
the case everywhere.

301
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,240
Some states and cities
do have good protections,

302
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,640
and I suppose we could wait
for every state to catch up.

303
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,280
But there are certain issues
too important to be left to the states,

304
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,320
specifically civil rights
and state birds.

305
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,000
You chose the scissor-tailed
flycatcher, Oklahoma ?

306
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,320
Are you fucking kidding me ?

307
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,080
How do you not go
with the eastern phoebe ?

308
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,760
That bird is
a pure-winged majesty,

309
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,240
but you went and chose a piece
of garbage with a beak ?

310
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,080
It looks like it fell out
of Miranda July's hair !

311
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,720
That's a shit bird, Oklahoma !

312
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,000
Shame on you !
You're on the wrong side of history !

313
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,440
Anyway, the point is,

314
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,200
states have a checkered history
when it comes to civil rights.

315
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,200
Just look at Arkansas right now.

316
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,840
Not only do they not have any
antidiscrimination ordinances,

317
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,920
earlier this year,
they actually passed

318
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,640
an anti-antidiscrimination ordinance,
that prevents any city or county

319
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,280
from extending civil rights protections
to gay people.

320
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,120
Here's a sponsor
of that law explaining why.

321
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,600
I want to be treated equal,

322
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,040
like I want someone from the
"LBGD" community to be treated equal.

323
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,040
Everyone should have
the same rights.

324
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,840
What are you talking about ?

325
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,840
This is not about "special rights."

326
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,440
We're not creating "lesbians only"
sections on airplanes

327
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,640
or putting up signs
at Six Flags saying

328
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,200
"you must be this gay
to go on this ride".

329
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,200
This is just basic equality.
That's all it is.

330
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,760
Now, there have been some positive
moves at the federal level.

331
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,280
Just last month,
the EEOC ruled

332
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,880
the Civil Rights Act
applies to LGB workers.

333
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,840
A year ago, the president added
LGBT protections

334
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,920
for federal contractors.

335
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,080
But those protections
could be undone by his successor.

336
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,040
Two of the Republican governors
running for president

337
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,280
actually weakened their states'
nondiscrimination policies.

338
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,120
Bobby Jindal let
an executive order expire

339
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,760
and John Kasich kept his
but removed the protections

340
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,720
for transgender workers.

341
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,000
And it must be strange
to live in a state

342
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,920
and see progress
actually move backwards.

343
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,960
It would be like if Apple
suddenly introduced the iPhone 7

344
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,640
and it was a flip phone.

345
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,120
That's still not as dumb
as the Apple Watch,

346
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,040
but it's dumb.

347
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,040
Not that dumb,
but dumb.

348
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,000
Now, the main argument against
extending these protections

349
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,680
is that it might force people to act
against their religious beliefs,

350
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,440
hence the rise of Religious Freedom
Restoration Acts around the country.

351
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,960
And religious freedom is not
an inherently bad thing.

352
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,200
I'm not just saying that
'cause I'm the current mega-reverend

353
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,560
of Our Lady
of Perpetual Exemption.

354
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,760
Praise be !

355
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,400
Praise be unto you.

356
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,840
This is not about me.

357
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,440
We allow for religious freedom
in limited, sensible ways all the time.

358
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,680
It's why Muslims can wear a hijab
in their driver's license photo

359
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,120
and why devout Christians can't
be forced to work on the Sabbath.

360
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,520
But there are
reasonable limits to it.

361
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,920
And we've all heard it mistakenly cited
in stories like this.

362
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,200
Colorado baker Jack Phillips estimates
he's made 5 000 wedding cakes

363
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,400
since he opened his shop,
Masterpiece Cakes, 20 years ago.

364
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,080
A deeply religious man,
Jack Phillips says he'll bake

365
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,280
birthday cakes, cupcakes
and a variety of other sweets

366
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,480
for same-sex couples,
just not a wedding cake.

367
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,960
I feel like I'm taking part
in the wedding.

368
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,920
Part of me goes
to the reception.

369
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,760
Part of you goes
to the reception ?

370
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,880
I have a horrifying sense
what that might mean.

371
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,640
In a way, I've been
married 5 000 times.

372
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,600
In another way,
I cum in the cake.

373
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,360
That baker denied service
to a gay couple in 2012,

374
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,200
saying that providing
them with a wedding cake

375
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,680
would offend his definition
of traditional marriage.

376
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,600
But that's a little hard to square

377
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,880
with the fact that he allegedly
had no problem providing a cake

378
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,440
for a wedding between two dogs.

379
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,320
Look, those dogs
may lick their own balls,

380
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
but I'm sure
they are regretting

381
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,320
ordering a vanilla cum cake
from the ejaculating baker of Colorado.

382
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,600
But the bigger flaw
in his argument

383
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,200
is his understanding
of how the law works.

384
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,800
The Constitution guarantees
me the right to practice my faith,

385
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,960
my religion, anywhere, anytime.
There are no restriction.

386
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,720
It also gives me the right
to free speech.

387
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,200
Except it doesn't, though.

388
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,560
Courts have already decided there are
limits on religious freedom.

389
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,080
You can't discriminate on race
based on your religious beliefs.

390
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,560
There are limits on free speech. You
can't yell "fire" in a crowded theater.

391
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,040
The Constitution isn't the star
in Super Mario Brothers.

392
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,120
It doesn't make you invincible.

393
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,440
Now, just so you know,
that baker lost his case,

394
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,160
because Colorado happens
to be one of the states

395
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,440
that has a law banning discrimination
based on sexual orientation.

396
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,480
And when states have those laws,

397
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,760
even states with religious freedom acts,

398
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,120
cases do now tend to go gay people's
way, which is good.

399
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,480
The problem is there are still
way too many states

400
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,160
that don't have antidiscrimination
laws at all.

401
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,360
So, maybe it's time
we just fix all of this,

402
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,440
nationwide, in one go.

403
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,440
There is something called
the Equality Act in Congress right now

404
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,360
which adds LGBT protections
to the Civil Rights Act,

405
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,880
the Fair Housing Act and so on.

406
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,760
It has over 200 cosponsors
in the House and Senate.

407
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,080
Unfortunately, precisely zero of them
are Republican,

408
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,520
which is genuinely difficult to do.

409
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,600
For instance, there's an actual bill
that just designated September the 25th

410
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,720
as National Lobster Day.

411
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,120
Even that had
two Republican cosponsors.

412
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,680
Look, I'm not saying lobsters
don't deserve recognition

413
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,360
from our government,
because they absolutely do.

414
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,520
Although, do they ?
That's not the point.

415
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,000
The point is, this bill represents

416
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,960
the bare minimum of not
being discriminated against

417
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,960
and this should be what represents
the threshold of true gay tolerance,

418
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,360
not whether or not you would
consider attending a gay wedding.

419
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,600
So, we actually reached out to every
single presidential candidate

420
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,280
and asked them "would you support
passage of a federal law that prohibits"

421
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,600
"discrimination based on sexual
orientation and gender identity"

422
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,360
"in the areas of employment, housing,
public accomodation

423
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,240
and access to credit".
It's a long question, yes.

424
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,280
But it's not a complicated one.

425
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,120
But only four campaigns
got back to us.

426
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Lincoln Chafee and Martin O'Malley
said they would,

427
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,960
but I think they were just happy
anyone had asked them anything.

428
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,280
So, discount that.
Bernie Sanders also said he would

429
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,040
and a spokesman for Rand Paul said:
"We'll pass. Thanks."

430
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,200
Okay. You're welcome.

431
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,000
Everyone else is presumably
still thinking about it.

432
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,200
But why ?
We reached out on Thursday

433
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,560
and it should not take that long
to work out

434
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,040
the answer to "should gay people
be discriminated against ?".

435
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,720
It's just "no".
That's it.

436
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,160
It is long past time that gay people
have the same rights

437
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,720
that straight people have,

438
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,160
namely to be fired because they're
being replaced by a computer,

439
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,440
to be denied service
at a restaurant

440
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,640
because they're neither
wealthy-looking nor attractive

441
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,320
and to have a wedding cake,
but not eat it

442
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,200
because they suspect a strange man
may have ejaculated into it.

443
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,400
And now this.

444
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:52,280
The most patient man on television
faces his greatest challenge.

445
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,440
Next we'll go to Susan in Boston.
Good morning, Susan.

446
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,440
We'll try Marge
in Peoria, Illinois.

447
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,480
- Marge, good morning.
- Good morning.

448
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,360
You're on the air. Go ahead,
you're on the air, Marge.

449
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,920
Okay.

450
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,200
This is Susan that was
on the air.

451
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,360
Susan, please go ahead.

452
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,640
- This is Marge now.
- Okay, I'm gonna...

453
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,320
And finally, tonight,
you might remember last week,

454
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,840
we discussed about
seed faith,

455
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,520
specifically how some preachers use it
to extract money from the vulnerable.

456
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,760
We then launched our own church,
Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption,

457
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,160
and asked you...

458
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,680
Praise be !

459
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,240
And we asked you to send us
money at this address.

460
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,240
And to be honest,
slightly more of you responded

461
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,000
than we were expecting.

462
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,960
Before I show you
just how many, let me stop,

463
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,800
because I firmly believe in the
separation of church and show.

464
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,640
So, I'm going to hand over now
to Pastor John Oliver,

465
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,720
mega-reverend and CEO.

466
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,840
So, please, at home,
bow, kneel, sit, stand

467
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,600
or whatever the fuck
it is our church does

468
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,200
and let us all together,
once again, go to church.

469
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,960
Brothers and sisters,
thank you so much for joining us.

470
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,320
Praise be.
First, apologies to you.

471
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,520
My wife, Wanda Jo, cannot be
with us this evening.

472
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,320
She is at our summer parsonage
in Hawaii

473
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,840
for a week of spiritual introspection
and parasailing. Praise Wanda !

474
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,240
Last week we asked you
to send us your seed offerings

475
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,120
and I would like to show you a little
of what we received,

476
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,080
because look at this harvest
you gave unto us.

477
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,840
Praise unto you ! Praise !

478
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,000
If I may, just a little feedback

479
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,400
on some of the blessings
that you've sent in.

480
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,960
I think we made it clear
"seed faith" is metaphorical,

481
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,520
and we did not want
your actual seeds,

482
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,200
which is why
it was so disappointing

483
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:11,440
that someone sent
this gigantic bag of seeds to us.

484
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,640
It was the biggest bag
of seeds I'd ever seen

485
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:20,160
until the next day, when this actual
bag of seeds turned up.

486
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:26,720
Let me reiterate.
We want your actual money.

487
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,640
Call this number
and give it to us.

488
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,720
Do not send us seeds.

489
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,400
And also, do not send us
beef jerky,

490
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,080
as someone else inexplicably
sent in this week.

491
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,080
Also, let me be clear,
we want US currency.

492
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,000
I should've mentioned
that last week,

493
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,560
because we have received currency
from all over the world,

494
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,480
including this 100 trillion
dollar bill from Zimbabwe.

495
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,880
I was actually
genuinely excited about this

496
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,920
and was about to send 100 trillion
blessings your way

497
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,840
until I checked
the exchange rate

498
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,920
and found out that this
is worth about 40 cents,

499
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,480
so now I wouldn't even bless you
if you fucking sneezed.

500
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,960
But, for those of you

501
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,040
who have sent us US currency,
great blessings unto you.

502
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,320
We have received
thousands of envelopes

503
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,320
with thousands of dollars,
some featuring heartwarming notes,

504
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,760
such as this 5 dollar bill,
attached to a letter reading

505
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,880
"take my seed,
"you rat-faced bastard".

506
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,920
Praise be. We also received
multiple checks,

507
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,360
including this one
for 65 billion dollars,

508
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,000
which you may have
sent in as a joke,

509
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,560
but we're fucking cashing it.
So who's laughing now ?

510
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,640
Anyway, keep your money
coming in, to this address.

511
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,680
Remember, the more money
you send in,

512
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,160
the more blessings will be
returned to you,

513
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,520
and that is still something
I am amazingly legally allowed to say.

514
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,360
That is our show. We are
off for the next two weeks.

515
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,720
I'm off to join Wanda Jo
on our Jet Ski.

516
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,640
It's a preaching machine,
brothers and sisters !

517
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,040
So, good night !

518
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,640
And join us later. Praise be !
Praise unto you.

519
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,040
Praise !

520
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,120
We ain't interested
in your seeds !

521
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,040
We ain't interested
in your seeds.

522
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,520
No more seeds.

523
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,320
Money.
Not seeds. Money.

524
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,240
