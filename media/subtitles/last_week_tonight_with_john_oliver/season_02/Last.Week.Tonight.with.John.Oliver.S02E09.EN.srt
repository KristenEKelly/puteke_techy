00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,320
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,680
SEASON II, EPISODE 9

3
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,760
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,560
Time for a quick recap of the week.
And let's start with today.

5
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,600
This morning, everyone was expecting
a big political announcement,

6
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,280
and then spent most of the day
continuing to expect it.

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,280
Hillary Clinton's expected to announce
she's running for president today

8
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,240
but what is she waiting for ?

9
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,360
Reporters are expecting it to happen
in the next minutes, around noon.

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,520
We're waiting for Hillary Clinton
to make it official.

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,720
- Any moment.
- We're waiting for that.

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,800
She's 67 years old. We'll see
when the announcement comes out.

13
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,760
Okay, first of all: it's 67 years young.

14
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,760
Didn't you learn anything from
"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel ?"

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,400
And second: there's no point trying
to build suspense when there isn't any.

16
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,200
Because everyone knew
this was happening.

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,880
I'll save you the time
of watching this video.

18
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,920
It's 2 minutes, 18 seconds long,

19
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,200
it features one dog, one cat,
and exactly four relevant words.

20
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,200
I'm running for president.

21
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,800
There is nothing else to see.
And nothing else to talk about.

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,760
Let me be clear: speculating over who's
going to win the 2016 election now

23
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,080
is like speculating over who's going to
win the shot put at the 2016 Olympics.

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,680
The only thing we know for sure is that
Ted Cruz isn't going to win either.

25
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,080
That's it. That's all we know.
So we can put it on hold.

26
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,400
Let's move on to talk about an election
that's actually imminent in the UK.

27
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,560
The slightly damp corpse
of the British empire.

28
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,480
Because in less than a month,
voters there will head to the polls.

29
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,680
And it's close.

30
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,680
David Cameron is trying to fend off
the Labour Party and Ed Miliband.

31
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,840
They are neck and neck. They're
a tenth of a percentage point apart.

32
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,040
Things are starting potentially
to get a little bit exciting.

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,840
"Potentially a little bit exciting."
Quintessentially British enthusiasm.

34
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,840
"This election might be, it probably
won't be but it could be interesting.

35
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,040
I'm sorry to have brought it up.
I've wasted your time."

36
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,320
The thing is
this election is actually interesting.

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,320
From the race to determine
who'll be prime minister,

38
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,240
down to the local elections, where
there are some very unusual candidates.

39
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,160
A UKIP candidate for this year's
local elections in Bristol

40
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,400
has been revealed
as an international porn star.

41
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,080
He performs
under the name of Johnny Rockard.

42
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,760
For reasons of decency, we can't
show you most of what's out there.

43
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,920
"We can give you the general gist
though and it is this. It's that."

44
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,920
You may be picturing what a porn star
called Johnny Rockard looks like.

45
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,880
But what you're imagining is wrong.
Because this is him.

46
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,360
I wouldn't say
I'm that bothered about it

47
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,080
because it's nothing that I'm ashamed
of in any way shape or form.

48
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,720
Your reaction may justifiably be,
"That's Johnny Rockard ?

49
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,520
I didn't realize suburban middle-aged
pharmacist was a fetish in Britain."

50
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,760
You're not wrong.
I don't buy that man as a porn star.

51
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,760
I barely buy him
as a porn caterer.

52
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,920
But let's put Johnny Rockard
aside for a second,

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,400
because the main race pits
Prime Minister David Cameron

54
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,440
against Labour leader Ed Miliband,
who is fighting a public perception

55
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,960
that as 41% of Britons said in a
poll last year he's a bit "weird."

56
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,920
And he's not been doing
a great job to disprove that.

57
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,280
During one the one
and only debate in Britain,

58
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,480
he left his notes behind
on the podium.

59
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,200
Unfortunately for him,
the press found them.

60
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,880
On them, it would appear to say

61
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,120
"Happy warrior, calm never agitated,
me versus DC,

62
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,520
decency, values, and relish
the chance to show who I am."

63
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,960
That clearly sounds pretty bad.
Although, to be honest,

64
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,640
you haven't seen the note I keep
on my desk for myself which reads,

65
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,320
"you're a funny man, not a loser,
don't let them see the sadness."

66
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,960
Miliband has also had
some image problems

67
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,160
following this embarrassing photo,

68
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,960
of him eating
a bacon sandwich appallingly.

69
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,400
You might think that's nothing but this
has become a genuine story in the UK,

70
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,040
with headlines such as "Ed Miliband
looks weird eating a bacon sandwich."

71
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,040
And sensing his opponent's weakness,
the British prime minister has pounced.

72
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,720
The Prime Minister seems to be eating
his way around the country.

73
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,880
He popped into
someone else's family barbeque

74
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,080
and was trying to look
sort of normal and cool

75
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,880
and ended up eating a hot dog
with a knife and fork.

76
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,680
We saw him later in the day
in a pie factory sampling pies

77
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,640
and making Scotch eggs.

78
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,320
And he washed it all down
with half a pint of stout

79
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,880
so I don't now quite what's going on
but they seem determined

80
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,960
to see Cameron
out on the campaign trail eating.

81
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,960
This is pathetic.

82
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,720
The UK election has apparently
been reduced to an eating contest.

83
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,680
They're one step away
from putting 50 sausage rolls

84
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,200
in front of each of them and saying,
"Who wants it more ? Go ! Eat !"

85
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,160
The most nauseating thing
that either candidate did

86
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,880
was nothing to do with food.

87
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,360
It was when David Cameron
visited the set of "Game of Thrones"

88
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,560
in an attempt to pander to the public,
and he claimed to be a huge fan.

89
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,960
I'm on the set of Game of Thrones.
As a government,

90
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,920
we're going to go on supporting
film industry, television industry.

91
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,920
So more fabulous television
is made just like the set

92
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,000
that I'm very excited to be on
right now as a big throney.

93
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,680
Siphoning goodwill from people
who enjoy "Game of Thrones"

94
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,240
is my thing. Especially tonight.

95
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,560
And secondly, especially tonight,

96
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,000
I refuse to believe
that you are a throney,

97
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,960
unless, by throney, you mean
"someone who fucks throw pillows",

98
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,280
in which case,
you're definitely a total throney.

99
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,560
But finally this week: Cuba.
Florida's teardrop tattoo.

100
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:56,640
This week, this week brought
a seismic shift in US/Cuban relations.

101
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,960
Let's take a look at the picture
everyone was waiting for.

102
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,960
The leaders of the US and Cuba
sitting down together,

103
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,760
shaking hands
a couple of times

104
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,600
and making plans to normalize
relations between the two countries.

105
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,880
As everyone who's ever been
through a bad breakup knows,

106
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,480
you don't normalize relations
by going straight to a handshake.

107
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,760
First you start with liking
a couple of Facebook statuses...

108
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,920
Maybe you comment, "that looks
so fun !" on a brunch photo of theirs.

109
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,600
And only then, do you shake hands
and lift your trade embargo.

110
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,960
There's a process with this shit.
Don't skip a step.

111
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,000
The president was pretty clear
about his reasons for this shift in tone.

112
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,960
If you keep on doing something
for 50 years and it doesn't work,

113
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,680
you should try something new.

114
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,640
Nice work, Obama ! You gave
70-year-old adulterers everywhere

115
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,000
an excuse to leave their wives
for their dental hygienists.

116
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,400
"Lorraine, to paraphrase
America's first black president,

117
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,480
we've been doing this for 50 years.

118
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,440
It isn't working.
It's time to start something new.

119
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,040
I'm off to bang Carly
in my Porsche boxster.

120
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,760
To quote the president."

121
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,840
This was clearly a historic meeting

122
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,440
and it turned out to be even
more cordial than anyone expected.

123
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,960
The president of Cuba saying
that he admires President Obama,

124
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,480
that he considers him
to be an honest man,

125
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,320
that he's read
President Obama's autobiography.

126
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,400
He's read the president's books !

127
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,080
That's both flattering,
and a bit of a fuck-you

128
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,680
to the concept
of a fifty-year trade embargo.

129
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,400
"I read your book on my iPad
'cause my Kindle Fire was broken.

130
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,320
You've been wasting your time."

131
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,920
For my peace of mind,
I need to clear this up:

132
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,080
was Castro saying
he read the president's book,

133
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,600
or that he had
the president's book ?

134
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,840
Those are two very different things.

135
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,920
That he's read
President Obama's autobiography.

136
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,920
He hasn't read all of them but
that he's started skimming those books.

137
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,760
Exactly. He skimmed them.
He did what millions of us have done:

138
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,520
he saw the president's book, thought,
"I guess I should read this,"

139
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,240
read a few pages,
went, "I'll finish it later"

140
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,120
and put it up on a shelf
next to Ulysses, the Bell Jar,

141
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,640
and all our other favorite books
we've never actually read.

142
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,560
I think the US and Cuba
are gonna get along just fine.

143
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,720
And now, this !

144
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,720
Excruciatingly awkward silences
caused by technical difficulties.

145
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,960
Terry Lyles, welcome back.

146
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,200
Terry Lyles, can you hear me ?

147
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,920
One more time.
It's Brooke on CNN, you got me ?

148
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,440
What's the best thing we can say
about this economy tonight ?

149
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,960
David, maybe you can't hear me.

150
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,280
Can you hear me Colonel ?

151
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,720
We are having audio problems.

152
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,920
Phil, can you hear me ?
I think we lost Phil.

153
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,120
Jim, good morning.

154
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,480
Phillip, can you hear me now ?

155
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,280
My... Our apologies.

156
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,920
- Can you hear me Congressman ?
- I didn't, I was listening to your...

157
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,280
Thank you.

158
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,480
Moving on.
Our main story tonight is the IRS.

159
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,680
I know that sounds unappealing.
But I promise you,

160
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,120
if you stay to the end of this,
there'll be a very sexy reward.

161
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,840
Now this Wednesday is April
the 15th, the day every year

162
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,120
when Wesley Snipes pokes
his little head out of his burrow

163
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,360
and, if he sees his own tax return,
quickly dives back in.

164
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,000
Like clockwork, tax season brings
with it an annual gnashing of teeth.

165
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,000
Two dreaded words
this time of year - tax time.

166
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,360
It is tax day.

167
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,080
Maybe you're holding your nose
while finishing up your taxes.

168
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,560
Tax season officially begins.

169
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,480
Tax season. It's the most
wonderful time of the year.

170
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,080
Happy tax day everybody.
That's sarcasm of course.

171
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,440
Yes, tax season is a lot
like bathing suit season.

172
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,360
You dread it unless
you're the kind of person

173
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,000
who spends a lot of time
in the Cayman Islands.

174
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,360
People hate taxes,
and they hate the IRS.

175
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,760
They can't help but express that,
whatever the circumstances.

176
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,280
This should make you
a real crowd favorite

177
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,440
John works for the IRS.

178
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,320
We've never had
a contestant booed !

179
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,480
He works
in collection for the IRS.

180
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,680
Come on !

181
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,760
What are you doing, Regis ?
Stop baiting the crowd !

182
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,120
"Boo him ! Let's lock the doors and
turn off the cameras and burn him !"

183
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,120
To be honest the IRS have not
been good at winning people over.

184
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,760
Particularly
with this current tax season.

185
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:31,360
Yes the IRS warning this year
will be worse than most for you.

186
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,840
If you need to visit an IRS office,
a word of warning - prepare to wait.

187
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,520
A little after 8, the line already
snaked around the sidewalk,

188
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,520
reaching out into the parking lot.

189
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,960
I came here Monday
and I was here from 7 to 4.

190
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,880
It's 2 people working inside.

191
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,400
Two employees ! That is not good.
If you're in that line, you need help.

192
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,320
No one waits that long for something
they could fix themselves.

193
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,040
It's the same way
that you know the people in line

194
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,040
at the emergency room at 2 am have
something stuck inside their butt.

195
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,480
"You ?" "Corn dog. You ?"
"Boba Fett action figure."

196
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,920
"I've been there."

197
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,920
If you're thinking,
this doesn't affect me,

198
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,080
I'll just call the IRS on the phone,
good luck with that.

199
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,720
4 in 10 callers to the toll-free line
are getting through to a real person.

200
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,080
The number of courtesy disconnects
when an overloaded system hangs up

201
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,280
has now reached 5 million
so far this year.

202
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,920
If the IRS's system gets overloaded, it
will give you a "courtesy disconnect,"

203
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,760
which means hanging up on you.

204
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,280
Can't put a nice word in front of an
unpleasant one and change meaning.

205
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,120
It's like the phrase "politely decline",
or "Care Bears."

206
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,440
They're still bears,
they'll rip you the fuck apart.

207
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,680
They're bears. It's in their blood.

208
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,280
Is it any wonder
that everyone hates the IRS ?

209
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,440
Dealing with them is obligatory,
it functions badly,

210
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,520
and it combines two of the things
that we hate the most:

211
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,680
someone taking our money,
and math.

212
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,080
And yet, tonight, I'm going
to attempt the impossible.

213
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,400
I'm going to try and make you feel
a small amount of sympathy for the IRS.

214
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,160
Because it cannot be
a pleasant place to work.

215
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,480
Listen to what extra little gifts they
get alongside people's tax returns.

216
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,960
We've had everything come
in from brown sugar to dust

217
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,080
out of a vacuum cleaner to people
spreading mustard on a check.

218
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,080
We wipe the mustard off
and send it to the bank.

219
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,200
Listen to how matter-of-fact he is.
This must happen all the time.

220
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,360
Some people
put mustard on the checks.

221
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,280
Some people file their returns
inside of a dead fish.

222
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,400
One man covered his check
in Vaseline and pubic hair.

223
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,120
We just wipe it off
and send it to the bank.

224
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,520
And it's not just furious mustard
enthusiasts taking it out on the IRS.

225
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,840
Even state governors
have publicly demonized them.

226
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,400
Governor LaPage didn't want
to talk about the outrage

227
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,200
he sparked when he compared
the IRS to the Gestapo.

228
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,120
But when we pushed him for
a comment, here's what he said.

229
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,240
It was never intended
to offend anyone.

230
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,640
You compared them to the Gestapo !
Of course they were offended !

231
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,360
If you compare someone to the Gestapo
and they don't get offended,

232
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,840
that's a big red flag.

233
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:29,000
The public perception of IRS
employees as Gestapo-like villains

234
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,560
doesn't quite match up when
you see what they're actually like.

235
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,240
On the IRS YouTube channel,

236
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,440
there are videos where employees
talk about their jobs.

237
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,280
And they don't seem evil
so much as unbelievably boring.

238
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,440
A data transcriber
takes the physical return

239
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,360
and inputs it
into the computer system.

240
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,920
You gotta know about
budgetary, proprietary accounting.

241
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,400
You're meeting taxpayers at their
residences, their places of business.

242
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,320
You're conducting
interviews on taxpayers.

243
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,440
You're investigating their assets.

244
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,600
You're there
interviewing third parties,

245
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,560
looking for assets that possibly
the taxpayer didn't disclose to you.

246
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,400
Those people aren't Nazis.
Nazis are inherently interesting.

247
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,200
Those people
are the physical equivalent of Ambien.

248
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,880
There is a weird kind of heroism
to doing jobs that are that boring.

249
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,480
'Cause not only
could I not do their job,

250
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,280
I can barely even listen
to them talking about it.

251
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,480
Why do we hate the IRS so much ?
Because it's worth remembering:

252
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,840
if you're angry about the amount of tax
you pay that's nothing to do with them.

253
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,240
That's determined
by a vote in Congress,

254
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,880
much like declarations of war and how
often Orrin Hatch is allowed to orgasm.

255
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,120
Not yet, Orrin... Not yet...

256
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,960
Now. There you go.

257
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,040
If you think our tax code
is too complicated,

258
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,240
well that's Congress's fault, too.

259
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,920
And you know who agrees with you ?
The people who work for the IRS.

260
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,440
Because even they
have trouble keeping up.

261
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,600
We looked at how many changes
in the tax law had occurred.

262
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,440
In the last year alone it was
something like 579 changes.

263
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,400
- 579 changes ?
- Changes in the tax law.

264
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,160
- That's more than a change every day.
- Yes.

265
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,040
- How do you keep up ?
- I don't.

266
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,440
I don't know how individuals
or businesses keep up.

267
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,240
579 changes in one year !
The only document

268
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,240
that should change that often
is the Wikipedia page for Bill Cosby.

269
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,120
"What are we now ?
32 accusers ? 34 ?

270
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,880
Holy shit,
I don't know how anyone keeps up.

271
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,080
This really should be going
above Fat Albert at this point."

272
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,280
Blaming the IRS
because you hate paying your taxes

273
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,800
is a bit like slapping
your check-out clerk

274
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,000
because the price of eggs
has gone up.

275
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,160
It's not her fault ! She's trying
to help you get out of the store.

276
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,480
That scenario is also my pitch
for "The Slap" season 2.

277
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,560
That apropos of nothing.
But let's recap:

278
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,680
the IRS does a difficult, thankless,
almost dangerously boring job.

279
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,160
That job has actually been getting
even more difficult, because of this !

280
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,400
The IRS budget
has been slashed in recent years.

281
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,960
Since the GOP won control
of the chamber back in 2010,

282
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,400
the agency's funding
has shrunk by nearly 20 percent.

283
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,640
You can't lose nearly 20 percent
of what you are and be as effective.

284
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,760
It's like pretending
Zayn leaving "One Direction"

285
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,080
doesn't tear the heart
out of that band.

286
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,480
He was 20 percent of the band,
but he was 99 percent of the soul !

287
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,880
It's over everyone.
Jordan has left the Bulls.

288
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,920
I don't like it anymore than you
but the DNA of the band is broken.

289
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,960
I can't believe I'm the one in this
room that cares the most about this.

290
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,440
Shame on you !

291
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:06,720
Congress has slashed the IRS's budget,
but largely out of anger.

292
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,840
Which was not entirely unjustified.
You may remember, a few years ago,

293
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,000
there were scandals over
overspending on conferences

294
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,000
and training videos like this
horrific parody of "Star Trek".

295
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,200
It would seem captain. The no Taxions,
lack of skilled tax leaders

296
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,960
has resulted in a widespread
case of confusion,

297
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,760
uninformed taxpayers, high
noncompliance, no strategic vision.

298
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,680
I'm afraid
without a wealth of skilled leaders,

299
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,080
anarchy is spreading
across the planet like a virus.

300
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,080
That's depressing.

301
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,720
I have seen "Star Trek" porn parodies
less depressing than that.

302
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,760
But that was nothing
next to the IRS's big scandal.

303
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,560
A report shows IRS officials
were targeting Tea Party

304
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,000
and other conservative groups
when those apply for tax exempt status.

305
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,360
The Tea Party targeting scandal.

306
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,120
Where the IRS inundated many
conservative groups with questions,

307
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,200
sometimes delaying
their applications for years.

308
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,080
While they did
target liberal groups as well,

309
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,480
those groups were scrutinized
to a much lesser extent,

310
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,840
and made up only 29
of the 298 groups targeted.

311
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,320
If you want to find liberal groups
to harass, it's easy.

312
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,240
Just Google "what was that thing
Alec Baldwin was going on about ?"

313
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,040
But, the investigation
into all this is ongoing.

314
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,800
And while current evidence
strongly suggests

315
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,040
this was more of a giant
bureaucratic fuckup,

316
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,520
for the sake of argument,
let's assume the absolute worst:

317
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,280
that this was deliberate
political targeting.

318
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,200
The best thing to do would be to get
rid of the people who were in charge,

319
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,080
and make some changes to how
the agency reviews political groups.

320
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,440
The worst thing to do
is what we've done,

321
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,480
and that's angrily slash their budget
so they can't operate properly.

322
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,320
Remember those long lines ?
You can thank the cuts for those.

323
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,760
Between 2010 and 2014,
the IRS lost over 13,000 employees.

324
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,760
A portion of our workforce
over 50 years of age

325
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,960
has been growing rapidly.

326
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,600
We have only 650 employees
out of 87,000 who are 25 or younger.

327
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,880
Most IRS employees are over 50,
and less than 1 percent are under 25.

328
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,880
That does not bode well for the IRS,
because a government agency

329
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,640
should not have the same age ratio
as an Eric Clapton concert.

330
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,320
IRS's staff is not the only thing
that is aging at a dangerous rate.

331
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,760
Some think
the IRS has fallen short

332
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,920
in their efforts to keep up
with modern day technology.

333
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,440
Almost half of all tax data
exists on a magnetic tape

334
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,520
and cartridge system
developed in the 1960s.

335
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,960
That is terrifying.
We should at least be using technology

336
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,560
invented after an era when it was okay
to call a female co-worker "toots."

337
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,840
We shouldn't fund the IRS because
we want our information stored

338
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,840
on something more sophisticated
than a fucking duck hunt cartridge.

339
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,800
We should fund them
because the IRS

340
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,280
is one of the safest investments
for public money available.

341
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,400
Every dollar spent on tax enforcement
yields back six.

342
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,400
The IRS sextuples your money !
They should make that their motto,

343
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,920
were it not for the fact that
"sextuples" is already the name

344
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,160
of Sandals spinoff most likely to get
shuttered by the health department.

345
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,160
"Welcome to sextuples,
where all you need to bring

346
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,320
is an open mind
and lots of bleach !

347
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,680
Lots of bleach.
Lots, that's on you."

348
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,800
The problem is, our whole tax system
is built upon trust.

349
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,920
And if people lose faith in the IRS,

350
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,400
the whole system by which
we fund everything is in trouble.

351
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,920
We collect 3 trillion dollars a year
in a voluntary compliance system.

352
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,120
If the compliance rate
goes down by 1%,

353
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,000
either because people think the
chances of getting caught are down

354
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,040
or because
they get aggravated with us,

355
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,960
a 1% decline in the compliance rate
costs 30 billion dollars annually.

356
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,360
The IRS compliance rate
is entirely based on confidence,

357
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,400
much like Lyle Lovett's sex appeal
or Channing Tatum's acting ability.

358
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,720
You lose that confidence,
everything collapses.

359
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,640
I'm not saying
the IRS is a likable organization.

360
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,560
But not everything
that's important is likable.

361
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,040
Think of our government as a body.
The IRS is the anus.

362
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,040
It's nobody's favorite part. But you
need that thing working properly,

363
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,800
or everything
goes to shit real quick.

364
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,960
And we don't need to love the IRS.
Or even like them.

365
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,200
But after decades of us calling
them Nazis and sending them mustard,

366
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,960
they deserve at least a few minutes
of at least grudging acknowledgement

367
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,000
of the unpleasant
but necessary function they serve.

368
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,680
Unfortunately, expression of sincere
emotion is not my forte. I'm British.

369
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,640
Luckily,
I have some serious help tonight.

370
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,080
So to serenade the IRS
with if not a love song,

371
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,760
a song of reluctant support
for their appropriate funding

372
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:20,680
please welcome Grammy award-winning
singer and songwriter, Michael Bolton.

373
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,520
I could hardly believe it
when I heard the news today.

374
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:49,120
Congress cut your budget
right in two.

375
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:58,360
I guess you make people angry
with the things you do and say.

376
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,280
'Cause you make us give
our money straight to you.

377
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,400
But we need you real bad, though
it's clear nobody really likes you.

378
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:20,000
You're the anus of our country,
don't you know...

379
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:27,600
Tell me how are we supposed
to live without you ?

380
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,120
We couldn't functionally survive, no.

381
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,720
How are we supposed
to live without you ?

382
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,680
And though saying this
just cuts me like a knife:

383
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:58,440
we need the IRS to stay alive.

384
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:11,000
And yes you've had fuckups
like that stupid "Star Trek" thing.

385
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,760
Tell me: who was it
who really thought of that ?

386
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,560
You'll be pleased to know:
the people responsible are all gone.

387
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,560
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Why ?

388
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,640
- They got staffing problems too.
- That's actually true.

389
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,440
Their recruitment numbers
are at best a little flat.

390
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,880
That's a nuanced point,
Michael Bolton.

391
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,480
I don't wanna know
just how we'd get along without them,

392
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,400
'cause you never miss
your anus till it's gone.

393
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,880
Tell me, how are we supposed
to live without you ?

394
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,600
We cut and cut
your budgets till you bleed.

395
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:11,400
How are we supposed
to live without you ?

396
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,360
And how'll we pay
for everything we need ?

397
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,760
Like Colorado National Park
procurement assistant Brian Reed.

398
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,200
That's a specific example, Michael.

399
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,360
IRS: you're never going
to be anyone's favorite agency.

400
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,960
You're boring, you're unlikeable,
but here's the thing:

401
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,560
deep down, we need you.

402
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,640
We need you
like we need our own anus.

403
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,240
Because like our anus,
we may not love you,

404
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,240
or like to talk about you,
or even want to look at you,

405
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,240
through a series
of strategically-placed mirrors.

406
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,640
But deep down,
we're glad you're there.

407
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,440
Is that now right, Michael ?
Tell them about it ! Tell them !

408
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,960
I don't wanna know
what life is like without an anus !

409
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,680
Sing it to them, Michael !

410
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,640
Won't you think of Brian Reed ?

411
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,680
Do you know that man, personally ?

412
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,360
Tell me how are we supposed
to live without you ?

413
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:25,120
We've relied on you
for funding for so long.

414
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:32,840
How are we supposed
to live without you ?

415
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,760
And how are we supposed
to carry on ?

416
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,040
When the only way to collect revenue
under our current governmental system

417
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,760
pending a significant
overhaul of the tax code

418
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,000
which seems
unlikely at best... is gone ?

419
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,040
Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Bolton !
That's our show. Good night !

420
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,000
How am I supposed
to live without you ?

421
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,440
Good night !

422
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,680
We couldn't functionally survive.

423
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,960
How are we supposed
to live without you ?

424
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:30,000
And though saying
this just cuts me like a knife.

425
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,960
Say it anyway, MB.
Say it anyway.

426
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:40,360
We need the IRS to stay alive.

427
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,320
Michael Bolton ladies and gentlemen.
Michael. Bolton !

428
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,520
END OF EPISODE 9,
SEASON II
