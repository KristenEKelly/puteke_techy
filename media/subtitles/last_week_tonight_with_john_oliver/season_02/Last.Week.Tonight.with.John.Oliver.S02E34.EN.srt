1
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,920
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,720
Thank you so much for joining us.

3
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,680
I'm John Oliver, just time
for a quick recap of the week.

4
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,800
And sadly, we must begin
with a few words about France,

5
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,040
which on Friday suffered the deadliest
attack on its soil since World War II.

6
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,720
It's hardly been 48 hours,
and much is still unknown,

7
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,960
but there are a few things
we can say for certain.

8
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,440
And this is when it actually
helps to be on HBO,

9
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,640
where those things can
be said without restraints.

10
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,720
Because after the many necessary
and appropriate moments of silence,

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,360
I'd like to offer you a moment
of premium cable profanity.

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,960
So, here is where things stand.
First, as of now,

13
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,840
we know this attack was carried out
by gigantic fucking assholes,

14
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,840
unconscionable flaming assholes

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,480
possibly working
with other fucking assholes,

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,280
definitely working in service
of an ideology of pure assholery.

17
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,000
Second, and this goes almost
without saying,

18
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,240
fuck these assholes !

19
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,360
Fuck them,
if I may say, sideways.

20
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,040
And third...
Third, it is important to remember

21
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,120
nothing about what these assholes
are trying to do is going to work.

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,520
France is going to endure.
And I'll tell you why.

23
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,920
If you're in a war of culture
and lifestyle with France,

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,120
good fucking luck.

25
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,560
Because, go ahead. Go ahead,
bring your bankrupt ideology,

26
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,400
they'll bring Jean-Paul Sartre,
Edith Piaf, fine wine,

27
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,640
Gauloises cigarettes,
Camus, Camembert,

28
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,440
madeleines, macarons,
Marcel Proust,

29
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,800
and the fucking Croquembouche !

30
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,600
The Croquembouche !

31
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,120
You just brought a philosophy
of rigorous self-abnegation

32
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,520
to a pastry fight, my friend.
You are fucked !

33
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,000
That is a French freedom tower.

34
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,000
So, to the people of France,
our thoughts are truly with you.

35
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,680
I do not doubt there will be more to
say on all of this as events unspool,

36
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,080
but for now, we are going to continue
with the rest of our show.

37
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,280
And let's turn to other parts
of the world. Specifically, China,

38
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,000
manufacturers of everything

39
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,720
except that piece of crap clay jar
you got for Mother's Day.

40
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,200
You're never gonna use it. This was
a big week for the Chinese economy.

41
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,680
The biggest shopping day in the world
has just become even bigger.

42
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,560
Singles' Day in China
has set a sales record.

43
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,840
Singles' Day, China's annual
shopping bonanza.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,840
China, you may have heard,
just wrapped up Singles' Day.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,080
Singles' Day !

46
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,760
Yes, November 11th was
"Singles' Day !" in China.

47
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,400
It's a holiday designed
to commemorate single people.

48
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,160
Because they think the date 11/11
looks like four single people in a row.

49
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,720
Although, honestly, April fourth seems
like a more appropriate Singles' Day

50
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,840
since a four looks like a man
reaching down to masturbate.

51
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,040
Yeah, good luck.
Good luck not thinking of that

52
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,600
every time you see the number four
for the rest of your life.

53
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,080
Singles' Day had been sort of
a novelty holiday until 2009

54
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,640
when the online retailer Alibaba
turned it into a sales event.

55
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,920
And since then,
it's become huge.

56
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,520
It was a record-breaking
Singles' Day for Alibaba,

57
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,840
with the e-commerce titan handling
more than $14 billion in transactions

58
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,160
during China's one-day
shopping bonanza.

59
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,920
Holy shit !

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,040
$14 billion.
To put that into perspective,

61
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,280
that's roughly the equivalent
of selling one Rupert Murdoch.

62
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,200
Now, to hit that target this year,
Alibaba pulled out all the stops,

63
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,720
holding a four-hour televised gala

64
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,160
that was part "American Idol,"
part Jerry Lewis telethon,

65
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,880
and part taking peyote in a Chinese
restaurant that's also a video arcade.

66
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,120
This thing had everything

67
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,680
from Imperial stormtroopers,
to clear ball suit fights,

68
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,600
to ball pits of death,

69
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,040
to Adam Lambert singing
from atop an iron throne.

70
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,640
Holy mother of dragons,

71
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,200
the last time something that horrific
took place on a "Game of Thrones" set,

72
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,680
Theon Greyjoy was having
his balls cut off.

73
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,560
And Adam Lambert was by no means
the biggest star they roped in.

74
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,560
Daniel Craig !
Let's welcome Daniel Craig !

75
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,240
James Bond !

76
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,960
Welcome to China !

77
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,680
Oh, no...

78
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,920
I've never seen James Bond
look so awkward and sad,

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,560
and most of his girlfriends
have died in front of him.

80
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,320
But perhaps the most inexplicable
celebrity cameo came via pre-tape.

81
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,400
Tonight I wanted to take a moment
to say hello to all of you out there

82
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,720
to wish you
a happy Singles' Day.

83
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,920
I'm sure there will be
loads of deals on candy, too.

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,240
Check Tmall and maybe you can
find a few packs of Presidential M&Ms.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,520
What is that accent ?
Even Chinese people must be thinking

86
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,000
"Hold on, isn't he supposed
to be from South Carolina ?

87
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,360
"Then why does he sound like Foghorn
Leghorn with his jaw wired shut ?"

88
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,560
I think we can call it now. $14 billion
spent on shit they don't need,

89
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,920
spurred on by
a bethroned Adam Lambert

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,480
and a two-time Oscar winner
hustling candy.

91
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,520
Congratulations, China, you just
out-America'd America. Well done.

92
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,360
And finally this week...

93
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,360
Finally this week, we turn to the UK
and its relationship with India,

94
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,000
or as we once called it,
"Britain's spice rack."

95
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,640
This week, India's
Prime Minster, Narendra Modi,

96
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,800
made his first official
visit to the UK,

97
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,800
the highlight of which
was a speech at Wembley Stadium

98
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,560
featuring fireworks, the Prime
Minister, a spectacular drum battle,

99
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,560
and a rousing speech.

100
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,400
I was told...

101
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,760
that London
would be cold.

102
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,520
But

103
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,440
not this much.

104
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,840
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Okay, that... Yes.

105
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,800
Fair play.
That was clearly a joke,

106
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,200
but it does also follow in the grand
tradition of the UK underselling

107
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,720
the severity of the conditions
an Indian leader would suffer under.

108
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,320
But for all the spectacle,

109
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,440
this trip had
a little tension behind it.

110
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,320
As you know, India used to be a British
colony. And our behavior was so bad

111
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,000
that in recent years many in India
have called for colonial reparations,

112
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,240
with one particular demand
recently gaining attention.

113
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,760
This is the Kohinoor diamond,

114
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,880
which reached Britain
during the reign of the British Empire

115
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,760
and became the magnificence
of the Queen's crown.

116
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,160
A lobby of Indian industrialists
and artists in London

117
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,280
are preparing to give legal challenge
to Queen Elizabeth

118
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,560
for Kohinoor's return to India.

119
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,000
Yes, some in India are demanding the
return of the fabled Kohinoor diamond,

120
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,320
which was removed from India,
and presented to Queen Victoria in 1850

121
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,400
before being embedded
in this elegant head sofa.

122
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,520
But the British government
is refusing to give that diamond up

123
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,040
for reasons that former Deputy Prime
Minister Nick Clegg explained.

124
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:59,920
There is no doubt in our mind that the
diamond was relocated to this country

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,560
under legal conditions
which are not in any doubt.

126
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,360
But, there is, I think,
clarity in the sincerity

127
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,560
with which the Queen holds
the crown jewels, all of them,

128
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,520
in trust,
on behalf of the nation,

129
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,200
has done for many generations, and
future monarchs will continue to do so.

130
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,240
Okay, okay,
that's an intricate legal argument,

131
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,280
so let me see if I can break it down
for you. What he's basically saying is,

132
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,560
"I understand that
you want the diamond,

133
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,240
"but the thing is we have
the diamond, you don't,

134
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,520
"and we're going to keep
having it forever.

135
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,480
"So, in summary, finders keepers,
go fuck yourself, cheerio."

136
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,600
And as for...

137
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,720
As for the current
Prime Minster, David Cameron,

138
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,120
when he was asked about returning
the diamond during a visit to India,

139
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,040
he simply stated,
"They're not having that back."

140
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,000
Which is so petulant
and childish a response

141
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,240
I'm surprised he didn't lick the
diamond to call official dibs on it.

142
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,520
In a way, you can understand why
Britain does not want to give it back.

143
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,520
All our greatest possessions
are stolen.

144
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,080
Tea, stolen.

145
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,480
The Elgin Marbles, let's say
permanently borrowed.

146
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,120
The entire British Museum is basically
an active crime scene.

147
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,400
And if we start giving back
everything we took from the empire,

148
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,880
that building will basically
be completely empty

149
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,560
except for one portrait
of Lord Alfred Tennyson,

150
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,400
and a pair of Gary Oldman's old
running shorts. And that can't happen.

151
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,360
And now, this.

152
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,120
And now... Another one of
John McCain's favorite jokes.

153
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,800
I landed at LaGuardia Airport today,
a guy ran up to me and said, "Hey."

154
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,640
He said, "Anybody ever tell you you
look a lot like Senator John McCain ?"

155
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,680
I said, "Yeah."
He said,

156
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,280
"Doesn't it sometimes
just make you mad as heck ?" So...

157
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,880
I landed at LaGuardia Airport today.

158
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,200
We were at Kennedy Airport
this morning.

159
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,120
Came through
Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport.

160
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,840
I was in the Atlanta Airport.

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,800
I was going through National Airport
just yesterday, I believe it was.

162
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,960
A guy ran up and said, "Hey."

163
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,520
"Did anybody ever tell you you look
a lot like Senator John McCain ?"

164
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,720
I said, "Yeah." He said, "Doesn't it
just make you mad as hell ?"

165
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,520
"Doesn't it just
make you mad as hell ?"

166
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,680
"...mad as hell ?"

167
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,600
"Doesn't it sometimes just
make you mad as hell ?"

168
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:21,280
Moving on. Our main story tonight
is about daily fantasy sports.

169
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,040
The most addictive thing you can do on
your phone other than perhaps cocaine.

170
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,280
If you own a television,
you cannot have missed their ads.

171
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,200
Get to Draftkings.com now for one-day
games that let you win daily.

172
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,280
FanDuel packs the thrill of a whole
season into just one week.

173
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
With FanDuel, there's no
season-long commitment.

174
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,480
Are your dreams big enough
to cash a giant check ?

175
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,440
Play free with promo code "trot."

176
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,360
Enter promo code "YouTube60."

177
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,240
Use the promo code "Clean6."

Enter promo code "Bang9."

179
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,240
Yes, daily fantasy sports
combine everything dudes love:

180
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,840
sports, money,
and a lack of commitment.

181
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:03,000
And I will say... the promo code
really gives it an air of exclusivity.

182
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,560
It's like you've just joined an elite
supper club whose password is "Bang9."

183
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,880
It's been impossible
to avoid those ads.

184
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,160
A few months ago, the two main daily
fantasy sites, DraftKings and FanDuel,

185
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,080
were airing a national TV ad
every 90 seconds.

186
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,160
You only need to remind people
of something that often

187
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,840
if your target market
is sports-loving goldfish.

188
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,240
Now, for those who don't know, let me
explain to you what daily fantasy is.

189
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,600
Until fairly recently, fantasy sports
used to be a season-long game

190
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,560
where you and your co-workers
picked imaginary teams of players,

191
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,760
put $20 each in a pot, and eventually
lost to Janice in accounting,

192
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,280
which would have been extremely
upsetting. And I'll tell you why,

193
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,720
she don't give a fuck about sports.
She don't give a fuck.

194
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,560
But daily fantasy is very different.
With daily fantasy you can go online,

195
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,000
typically pay an entry fee of anything
from 25 cents to thousands of dollars,

196
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,960
pick a team for just a week or a day,
and compete against total strangers.

197
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,160
It's the same as season-long fantasy

198
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,880
the way a nice mug of tea
is the same as a nice baggie of heroin.

199
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,040
Both give you a lovely warm feeling,
one's a little more intense.

200
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,120
And many TV networks are not
just airing daily fantasy ads,

201
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,120
they're making deals
with these companies.

202
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,400
We should note NBC Sports Group
and NBC's parent company, Comcast,

203
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,320
are among the investors in FanDuel.

204
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,840
I should disclose that 21st Century Fox
owns a stake in DraftKings.

205
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,400
CNN's parent company, Time Warner,
has made an investment in FanDuel.

206
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,040
ESPN has an exclusive two-year
marketing agreement with DraftKings

207
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,560
worth reported $250 million.

208
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,400
At this point, there is almost no show
that is not financially compromised

209
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,160
by a relationship
with daily fantasy,

210
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,600
including "Yell at Your Daughter
'Till She Dances" on Lifetime.

211
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,760
In fact, just so you know,
HBO is a subsidiary of Time Warner,

212
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,320
which means this joke about being
compromised is, in a sense,

213
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,600
brought to you by FanDuel.

214
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,200
And I'll say...
Thanks, guys.

215
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,720
And it's not just TV networks.

216
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,840
Some of the sports leagues themselves
closely partnered with these sites.

217
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,400
The NBA has an equity stake in FanDuel,
MLB has one in DraftKings,

218
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,360
and many NFL teams have advertising
deals with the fantasy sites.

219
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,880
In fact, 28 of the NFL's 32 teams

220
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,880
have sponsorship deals
with either DraftKings of FanDuel,

221
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,280
and the Cowboys and the Patriots owners
are both investors in DraftKings.

222
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,080
And of course leagues and networks
like the idea of daily fantasy.

223
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,800
It's the only thing that's gonna make
people want to watch

224
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,680
the Bucs and the Jaguars face off
on a rainy Thursday night.

225
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,520
No one is just to witness the majesty
of Tampa Bay kicker Connor Barth

226
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,600
unless you are Connor's mom.
And even then, she might DVR it.

227
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,680
"I'm sorry, Connor, but it is Thursday.
It's 'Scandal' night.

228
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,600
"I've got ShondaLand right through.
Have a good kick.

229
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,200
"I hope you kick good."

230
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,880
It's a little weird to see professional
sports in cahoots with these sites

231
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,480
because most leagues have generally
been opposed to gambling,

232
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,240
unlicensed gambling
is illegal in most states,

233
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,440
and these sites do look
a lot like gambling.

234
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,760
Don't take that from me, take it from
Hall-of-Fame quarterback Joe Namath.

235
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,520
- Do you feel like it's gambling ?
- Do they have to pay to play ?

236
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,560
- I think you have to pay.
- And do they win something ?

237
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,120
- They do.
- It's gambling.

238
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,680
Okay. Okay. Okay.

239
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,240
So, Joe Namath,
a man so lacking in discernment

240
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,040
he wore this to the Super Bowl,

241
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,240
even he can see that this is gambling.
And he's not alone.

242
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,120
Just last month the Gaming Control
Board of Nevada ruled it was gambling.

243
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,920
Arguing, "If people will lose all their
money pressing buttons on a screen,

244
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,240
"that screen better have
'Sex and the City' characters on it."

245
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,040
And just this week
there was another development.

246
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,920
Big trouble for those daily fantasy
sports sites FanDuel and DraftKings.

247
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,840
New York's Attorney General
says they amount to illegal gambling.

248
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,960
Yes, the New York Attorney General is
attempting to shut down daily fantasy.

249
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,160
And if that happens, the best way to
gamble here will once again be

250
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,240
buying meat on a stick
from a guy with a cart.

251
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,760
Why does my chicken
have whiskers ?

252
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,520
Do you know what ?
I'm hungry, I'm rolling the dice.

253
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,400
But both major daily fantasy sites
insist that they've done nothing wrong.

254
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,680
In fact, DraftKings even claims
on its website that its 100% legal,

255
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,520
which is immediately suspicious.

256
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,880
If the guy at TCBY said,
"This frozen yogurt is 100% legal,"

257
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,600
you would know that somehow it was
a product of the illegal sex trade.

258
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,880
And both companies bristle
at the very word "gambling,"

259
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,720
insisting that they are
something far more benign.

260
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:05,240
You don't view what you do
here at FanDuel as gambling ?

261
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,440
That's a word that isn't used
very much around here, I take it ?

262
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,920
'Cause we are... Every time that
you talk to our users,

263
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,320
what comes through is the fact that
we're an entertainment product.

264
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,280
Okay. Okay, sure. But you know what
else is an entertainment product ?

265
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,800
Gambling.
Gambling is incredibly entertaining.

266
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:31,280
Until, of course, you're down 15 grand
to a Russian "entertainment" syndicate.

267
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,920
But when DraftKings, in particular,
claims that it's not gambling,

268
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,320
it's worth noting, not only have they
received a gambling license in the UK,

269
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,360
but according to
the Nevada Attorney General,

270
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,720
their website once had search engine
optimization phrases

271
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,800
with multiple instances
of the word "betting."

272
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,480
Sites usually use alt text like that to
tell search engines what they are.

273
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,240
It's why this show's
website is tagged with...

274
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,800
"british nerd", "brit dork",
"news goof", "birdy fact funny man".

275
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,120
So here's the question.

276
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:11,080
How can DraftKings say
they are not gambling and 100% legal ?

277
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,360
Well, daily fantasy sites often point
to one particular piece of legislation,

278
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,800
the 2006 Unlawful Internet Gambling
Enforcement Act, or UIGEA.

279
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,640
Right now, fantasy sports being a game
of skill, is carved out of UIGEA

280
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,520
and permissible in
most states in the U.S.

281
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,120
Under the current law it's very obvious
that this fits within skill gaming.

282
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,720
What he refers to in his charismatic,
monotone, sleep-inducing voice

283
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,840
is that in 2006 when Congress passed
a law to crack down on online gambling,

284
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,680
it exempted fantasy sports.
Which, remember, back then

285
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,960
were just those office things
that you lost to Janice in accounting.

286
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,640
It was meant to be a small exception,
but through that small carve out,

287
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,040
two multi-billion dollar
businesses have emerged.

288
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,840
It's like those lawmakers
built a doggy door for a beloved pooch,

289
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,360
and then daily fantasy came bursting
through like a pack of wolves, saying,

290
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,640
"We are dogs.
It's a doggy door, right ?

291
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,440
"That's for us, we're legally dogs.
Woof. "Right ? Tell 'em. Woof.

292
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,600
"Woof.

293
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,120
"Step aside. Woof."

294
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,800
But even the guy
who co-wrote that law

295
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,760
says it wasn't meant to apply to what
fantasy sports have now become.

296
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,280
The US Congressman who drafted
the 2006 legislation

297
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,440
used by DraftKings and FanDuel
as proof of their legitimacy is upset.

298
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,000
Former lawmaker Jim Leach
says, it is, quote,

299
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,280
"sheer 'shutzpah'" for
the daily fantasy sports sites

300
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,680
to pretend the law
makes them legal.

301
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,040
Okay, okay.
Okay, first of all,

302
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,120
"Chutzpah" is actually
pronounced "hootzpah"...

303
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,000
The idea that daily fantasy sites use
this law to claim they're not gambling

304
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,480
is not chutzpah,
it's horse shit.

305
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,560
That law, interestingly, that law never
said fantasy sports were legal,

306
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,920
it just said they weren't explicitly
illegal under that specific law,

307
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,760
but that each state's gambling laws
would continue to apply.

308
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,160
And, in general, most states determine
whether or not something is gambling

309
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,000
by asking whether it's more of a game
of chance, or more a game of skill.

310
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,560
If being a game of chance could make
you gambling, and therefore illegal,

311
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,600
it's no wonder that daily fantasy sites
like to describe themselves like this.

312
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,560
They are games of skill. And we can
prove that through data that we have.

313
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,800
If skill is a predominant factor
in the game, then it's a game of skill.

314
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,960
We can show our game, like traditional
fantasy sports, is skill-predominant.

315
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,120
It's legally critical to these
companies they be perceived as such.

316
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,280
That's why every time they talk
you hear the word "skills"

317
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,640
more often than during
an underground rap battle.

318
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,200
Just this Friday, daily fantasy
supporters held a protest rally

319
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,200
outside the New York Attorney General's
office with a familiar chant.

320
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,480
Game of skill ! Game of skill !
Game of skill !

321
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,840
Now, if you're thinking,

322
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:15,400
it's a bit odd that ordinary fans were
chanting something so legally specific,

323
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,600
there may actually
be a reason for that.

324
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,160
Behind me this morning,
there were about 250 people here.

325
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,280
They blocked the sidewalk.
A lot of police,

326
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,840
a lot of protesters
making a lot of noise.

327
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,560
But 100 of those 250 people were
employees of FanDuel themselves

328
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,000
because their offices are
right here in Union Square.

329
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,880
They used their own
employees as protesters.

330
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,640
If you are trying
to make the argument

331
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,880
that you are not a shady
gambling-related company,

332
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,520
maybe don't openly
stack the deck in your favor.

333
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,720
Which is not to say that
daily fantasy does not involve skill.

334
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,480
It might involve a lot more skill than
they would like you to be aware of.

335
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,880
Because this summer, a study revealed
some shocking numbers.

336
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:02,720
91% of the profits were won
by just the top 1.3% of players

337
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,240
during the first half
of the baseball season.

338
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,200
85% of players were losers.

339
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:13,320
85% of fantasy players were losers,
which is staggering.

340
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,320
In the general population
that number is 40% at best.

341
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:23,160
It essentially breaks down like this.
40% losers, 40% assholes,

342
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,640
14% weirdos,
5% decent human beings,

343
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,680
and then, of course, Beyoncé.

344
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,880
And if you are wondering

345
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,320
what it takes to be part of that big
winning one percent, let me show you.

346
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,400
Albertson made over $200,000
playing fantasy sports last year.

347
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,600
In drafting his fantasy teams,

348
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,000
Albertson spends hours each day
studying his own homemade algorithms

349
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,360
that track thousands
of up-to-the-minute statistics

350
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,680
and player projections.

351
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,520
Projections that even factor
in the hourly weather forecasts

352
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,800
and wind conditions
in each stadium.

353
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,880
This is every pitcher,
basically, in baseball.

354
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,440
We've got dozens
of rows of statistics.

355
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,560
Yes, fantasy sports are
effectively dominated

356
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,800
by numbers nerds
with sophisticated algorithms.

357
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,240
Great news for anyone who wished
"Moneyball" could be a bit more boring.

358
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,640
But it's not great news
for a casual player.

359
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,000
And it somewhat undercuts
the key selling point in their ads.

360
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,920
Anybody can win.
It's not just a game for professionals.

361
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,320
It's for everybody. FanDuel made it
where anybody can play and succeed.

362
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,440
Yeah, but "anybody can succeed"
is a bit of a stretch

363
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,840
when only one percent of the players
are winning most of the money.

364
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,840
To say "anyone can succeed" on daily
fantasy is a bit like saying that

365
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,840
I could be the next James Bond.
Sure, it's a mathematical possibility,

366
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:55,320
but it's a long shot. It's a different
movie. It's a different movie.

367
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,800
Not better or worse,
just different.

368
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,800
So, these daily fantasy sites
may be in a bit of a quandary.

369
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,520
Under our hazy gambling laws,

370
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,320
the more they're a game of skill, the
stronger their legal case usually is,

371
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,600
but the less appealing they become
to the average player.

372
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,000
And there's a precedent for an online
amalgam of skill and chance.

373
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,120
Unfortunately for daily fantasy,
it's poker,

374
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,320
which most states
consider gambling.

375
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,880
And you would think
if these sites were smart

376
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,160
they would run away as fast as they
could from any comparison to poker.

377
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,800
So, if you go and play DraftKings,

378
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,240
it actually, in many ways,
has a similar feel to poker.

379
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,800
The games have payout
structures that are similar,

380
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,680
you can play head-to-head all the way
up to larger tournaments.

381
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,160
The way he's describing daily fantasy
and poker is so similar

382
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,120
most people
could not tell them apart.

383
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,640
They're like alligators and crocodiles,
or Amy Adams and Isla Fisher.

384
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,320
Are those two different people
or the same person twice ?

385
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,200
It's impossible to tell.
Nobody knows.

386
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,760
The similarities between online poker
and daily fantasy don't stop there.

387
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,520
Remember Cory Albertson ?
The guy with the homemade algorithm ?

388
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,560
Guess where he honed those skills ?

389
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,680
In a past life
he was a professional poker player.

390
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,200
He's all in and in trouble against Cory
Albertson, both with a pair of jacks.

391
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,800
But then he discovered
daily fantasy sports

392
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,320
and has been winning big against
his online opponents ever since.

393
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,560
Look, if it attracts the same people
and requires the same sorts of skills,

394
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,040
it's safe to say
it is somewhat similar.

395
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,800
It's like finding out an Olympic
gymnast has joined Cirque du Soleil.

396
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,200
Or an Olympic snowboarder has joined
a Colorado pot dispensary.

397
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,240
There's connective tissue
there. That's all I'm saying.

398
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,880
And in case its connection to the world
of poker was not clear enough,

399
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,840
guess who was a sponsor of the
World Series of Poker this year ?

400
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,240
The World Series of Poker main event
telecast, presented by DraftKings.

401
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,440
They're basically saying, "If you love
gambling, you'll love DraftKings...

402
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,120
"for completely
unrelated reasons."

403
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,720
Look, by any rational definition,
daily fantasy is gambling.

404
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,960
Which isn't necessarily
a bad thing. People clearly love it.

405
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:19,000
But if we're going to de facto legalize
sports gambling across the U.S.,

406
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,240
we should at least
do it on purpose

407
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,800
and not because two companies have
somehow weaseled out a way

408
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,040
to pretend that they are not something
that they clearly are.

409
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,440
Because gambling enterprises,
wherever they are legal,

410
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,400
are regulated to protect people, and
that's going to need to happen here.

411
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,600
And until such time, if they're going
to keep bombarding us with those ads,

412
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,560
they should at least make them
a little more honest.

413
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,440
Daily Fantasy is the hottest
new way to make real money.

414
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,160
As soon as I tried DraftKings,
I was hooked.

415
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,200
I've been using FanDuel since I saw all
those commercials on TV all the time.

416
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,320
I turned $35 into $2 million,

417
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,760
into $40, into $0 on FanDuel.

418
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,680
Daily fantasy is the best.
I get to play every day.

419
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,160
- You mean you get to gamble.
- It's not gambling.

420
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,280
Oh, it's definitely gambling.
You have a massive gambling problem.

421
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,560
It's actually a skills-based game
that is gonna make us rich one day.

422
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,360
- You're an idiot.
- I'm a winner.

423
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,040
With Daily Fantasy,
anyone can win.

424
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,320
I've won $784,000 on FanDuel.

425
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,200
See ? You can compete against millions
of regular sports fans just like you.

426
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,480
I have a master's degree in statistics
and I've designed an advanced algorithm

427
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,120
that incorporates real time
weather condition updates

428
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,440
and can calculate an earned run average
to the 20th decimal point.

429
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,000
Hey, jocks, how does it feel
to be a nerd's bitch ?

430
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,880
Daily Fantasy sports is the only
skills-based entertainment product

431
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,400
where you can win big money.

432
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,160
- You're a winner ?
- I'm a winner.

433
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,320
- How the fuck are you a winner ?
- How the fuck am I a winner ?

434
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,800
I'll tell you how the fuck
I'm a winner.

435
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,080
I won six dollars and 18 fucking cents
playing daily fantasy.

436
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,120
- That's how the fuck I'm a winner.
- You spent $1,200.

437
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,440
Well, that's what you gotta do,
you gotta spend money to make money.

438
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,280
To make $6.18
you spent $1,200 ?

439
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,000
- Yeah, that's how it works.
- I don't understand you.

440
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,280
- You don't understand sports.
- I understand math.

441
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,160
Don't listen to the critics,
Daily Fantasy is a legitimate business.

442
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,400
Daily Fantasy has the support
of the NFL.

443
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,160
When have they ever been associated
with anything shady ?

444
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,920
The best part about it
is that it's currently legal.

445
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,680
So, I'm excited about that.

446
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,840
- Look at the size of this check !
- Oh, here we go with the check.

447
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,200
- Look at this check !
- $1,200 and you won $6.18 !

448
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,720
You saying I'm not a big winner ?

449
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,880
You spent $18 printing out
this check at Kinko's.

450
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,040
Well, I was proud that I won.
And look who the check is made out to.

451
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,320
"Big Winner."
Your fucking husband.

452
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,880
Why don't you put it where
the TV used to go, asshole.

453
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,240
Daily Fantasy sports
is just pure fun. And it's so simple.

454
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,280
I just watch football
and win money.

455
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,240
I know that sounds
too good to be true, in fact,

456
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,800
even saying it out loud now, I'm
realizing that can't possibly be true.

457
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,040
Can you give me a minute ?

458
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,680
I hate you so much !

459
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,080
Daily Fantasy is not just fun.

460
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,880
It's who I am,
it's what the fuck I do.

461
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,080
- I'm gonna turn this into a career !
- I'm pregnant.

462
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,440
Fuck !

463
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,320
And if you're concerned that
Daily Fantasy sounds like gambling,

464
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,960
don't worry, it isn't.

465
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,280
It's not gambling. It's playing a game
where my cash winnings

466
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,240
depend on the performance
of professional athletes.

467
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,280
Wait, I described gambling
again, didn't I ? Fuck.

468
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,640
With Daily Fantasy,
all you need is a love of sports.

469
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,120
I think I just realized that at this
very moment I actually hate you.

470
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,600
Fantastic, I hate me too, so...

471
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,520
That's something we agree on
for the first time in a while.

472
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,440
Is there something stronger
than a divorce that we could get ?

473
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,920
Like, a super divorce ?

474
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,600
If there was, we probably
couldn't afford it.

475
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,760
Play Daily Fantasy now.
Just use promo code "Gambling."

476
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,520

478
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,240
That's our show, thank you
so much for watching.

479
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
Have a great night,
good bye !

480
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,720
- We haven't been happy for years.
- No, we have not.

481
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,920
We thought this baby
would save our marriage.

482
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,120
- I knew it wouldn't.
- I knew it wouldn't either.

483
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,400
- I knew it wouldn't.
- I was hoping it'd make you happy.

484
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,960
- I knew it wouldn't.
- You think I want this baby ?

485
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,160
- You think I want this baby ?
- Well, I don't want it !

486
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,480
I don't want it either ! I cried.

487
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,080
- Fuck.
- Well, it's... It's over.

488
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,160
It's done.
I think it just died already.

489
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,240
I can feel it.
It's dead.

490
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,800
This talk just killed it.
