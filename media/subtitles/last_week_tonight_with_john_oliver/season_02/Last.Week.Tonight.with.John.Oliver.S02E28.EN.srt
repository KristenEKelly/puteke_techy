LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Season II,
Episode 28

3
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,280
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight" !

4
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,600
Thank you so much
for joining us.

5
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,280
I'm John Oliver. Just time
for a quick recap of the week,

6
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,520
and we begin with the pope,

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,120
the only person on Earth
who can pull off a white cape,

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,480
Gwyneth.

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,640
He's the only one.

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,240
You look like a photo negative
of Darth Vader.

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,160
Anyway, the pope was
in the United States this week,

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,040
speaking before Congress,
visiting the UN,

13
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,720
riding through Central Park,

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,840
going to Philly for no clear reason

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,360
and encountering
adoring crowds everywhere.

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,280
Thousands greeted Pope Francis
as he arrived in New York,

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,720
lining the roadways
through Manhattan,

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,320
waving flags and banners, raising
their cell phones for a picture.

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,400
Yes, everywhere he went,
it seems people in America wanted

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,960
to show the pope their new iPhones.
"Look, Holy Father !"

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,680
"It's the iPhone 6s !
I've got it !"

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,800
"It comes in rose gold
and it has an A9 chip !"

23
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,640
"The iPhone 6 only had
an A8 chip, Your Holiness !"

24
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,640
"Please, touch my phone so the battery
may have everlasting life !"

25
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,120
This was a truly
historic trip for the pope,

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,000
not least because he was directly
responsible for a miracle.

27
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,560
Just watch how his arrival
was reported on MSNBC.

28
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,400
POPE FRANCIS
IN AMERICA

29
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,400
Good day. I'm Brian Williams
at MSNBC headquarters, New York.

30
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,880
Holy shit ! He brought
Brian Williams back from the dead.

31
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,320
It's a miracle !
Although, you know what ?

32
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,200
I will say, hearing Brian Williams
report something now

33
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,760
is like reading about it
in the New Testament.

34
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,160
I believe a man named
Pope Francis exists,

35
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,960
but a lot of the details
were probably embellished.

36
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,720
And for a man who has been off
the air for so long,

37
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,360
he spent a long time obsessing
over one particular detail.

38
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,960
The magic of that face
and that smile and his touch...

39
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,360
His sense of touch...

40
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,320
The power of his touch...

41
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,000
The yearning to touch him...

42
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,320
This very tactile pope...

43
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,320
Her lips said "I love you"
when she met the pope.

44
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,760
So tactile.

45
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,880
I think Brian Williams
wants to pet the pope.

46
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,000
I think he does.

47
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,440
There is no doubt the pope seems
to inspire

48
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,320
strange reactions wherever he goes,
but the strangest one this week

49
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,640
may have come from
Congressman Bob Brady.

50
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,400
The democrat watched
as the pope addressed

51
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,040
the joint session
of Congress Thursday,

52
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,000
and then proceeded to take
his unfinished glass of water.

53
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,720
He took a sip before carrying
the glass back to his office.

54
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,840
He plans on blessing his grandchildren
with the rest of the water.

55
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,600
He drank the pope's water.

56
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,720
I don't mean
to be disrespectful,

57
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,760
but I'm pretty sure that is not part
of the Catholic faith.

58
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,080
That is not holy water
that you're drinking.

59
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,480
It is the backwash
from an old Argentinian man.

60
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,280
That is what you have there.

61
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,240
So let's move on.

62
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,960
Let's move on to the United Kingdom,
Europe's America.

63
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,760
All this week the UK
has been captivated by revelations

64
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,320
in a new, unauthorized biography
of Prime Minister David Cameron.

65
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,000
You may ask what about
David Cameron could be captivating.

66
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,400
Well, just wait.

67
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,560
There are allegations the young David
Cameron smoked cannabis at Oxford

68
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,880
and even that he took part in a bizarre
initiation ceremony for a dining club

69
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,000
involving a pig.

70
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,400
"Bizarre" is a kind way
of describing it,

71
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,360
because the actual allegation
is that a dead pig's head was resting

72
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,440
in the lap of a dining club member
and then, and I quote,

73
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,760
"the future PM inserted a private
part of his anatomy"

74
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,680
"into the animal's mouth".

75
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,240
Yes. This book actually
contains a claim

76
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,600
that David Cameron,
Prime Minister of the UK,

77
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,960
once put his dick
in a dead pig's mouth.

78
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,440
And look, this is just the word
of a single source

79
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,480
published in an unauthorized biography.
We do not know if this is true.

80
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,280
But please,
please let it be true,

81
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,080
because a prime minister
receiving oral copulation

82
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,920
from a dead pig hits
the perfect sweet spot

83
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,360
between one of the most
horrific things ever

84
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,800
and one of the most
amazing things ever.

85
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,720
And again, this is based on
a single source,

86
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,720
and even the co-author's rationale
for including it is a little thin.

87
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,280
We did think about whether
we should put it in or not,

88
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,080
and in the end,
it made us smile.

89
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,160
I have to say, "we thought about
whether to put it in or not,"

90
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,120
"but in the end,
it made us smile," sounds like

91
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,800
something David Cameron would say
after sticking his dick in a dead pig.

92
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,520
If he did.

93
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,080
Which he definitely did.

94
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,160
I honestly don't want to look
into this story too closely

95
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,160
in case it falls apart, but to ignore it
simply because it might not be true

96
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,000
is to look a gift horse
in the mouth.

97
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,120
A mouth tenderly wrapped
around the thrusting penis

98
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,800
of British Prime Minister
David Cameron.

99
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,080
It's made even better by the fact
that it's almost impossible

100
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,720
to discuss this on television,

101
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,840
even though many people
have very clearly wanted to.

102
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,120
There are lurid allegations
that are made in this book,

103
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,640
but we can't explicitly
talk about them at this hour.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,200
...the pig and what did
or didn't happen.

105
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,640
- Enough said, I think. Don't you ?
- I could say a lot more on that.

106
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,000
Do you anticipate many leaving
to join the Lib Dems ?

107
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,200
Well, I think
you also have this issue

108
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,520
of the prime minister putting his cock
in a dead pig's mouth.

109
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,200
Dan, do you know what, mate ?
One, it's an allegation.

110
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,040
Two, your choice of language
in referring to that

111
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,520
far goes beyond what is permitted
at this time of the day.

112
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,120
Okay, but in
that caller's defense,

113
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,080
"putting his cock
in a dead pig's mouth" probably is

114
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,440
the politest possible way to say it.

115
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,840
Consider the alternatives.

116
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,600
"David Cameron was sucked
and fucked by a Christmas ham."

117
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,640
Is that better ?

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,400
"He received
an unenthusiastic blowie"

119
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,360
"from one-third of a BLT."
Do you prefer that ?

120
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,400
You tell me a delicate way
to put this.

121
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm not kidding.
Go on Twitter right now

122
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,960
and tell the British media
a more delicate way to put it,

123
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:14,760
using the hashtag "respectful
interspecies face fuck". Have at it !

124
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,720
And finally,
let's move on to cars,

125
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,680
the smartest characters in
the "Fast & Furious" movies.

126
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,200
This week, German automaker
Volkswagen found itself

127
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,520
in the middle of a scandal
of potentially criminal proportions.

128
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,880
Volkswagen is bracing
for billions in fines,

129
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,400
possible criminal charges
for its executives

130
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,280
as the company apologizes
for rigging 11 million cars

131
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,160
to help it beat
emissions tests.

132
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,240
Certain models were designed
with a sophisticated software

133
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,160
that used the position of the steering
wheel and the speed of the vehicle

134
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,960
to determine the car was undergoing
emissions testing.

135
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,960
Under that circumstance, the engine
would reduce toxic emissions,

136
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,240
but the car was rigged to bypass that
when it was being driven.

137
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,800
Emissions increased 10 to 40 times

138
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,000
above acceptable EPA levels.

139
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,120
10 to 40 times greater
than the EPA allows.

140
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,240
"That is the worst thing
Volkswagen has ever done"

141
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,000
is something you might say
if you'd never heard of World War II.

142
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,960
But maybe the surest sign
of how much trouble Volkswagen is in

143
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,000
is that people at the very top
have stepped down.

144
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,560
The CEO resigned on Wednesday
after scrambling to do damage control,

145
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,800
saying he was
"endlessly sorry",

146
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,000
which sounded great until
it turned out he was only 10% sorry

147
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,760
but had rigged his mouth to
artificially inflate his sorriness.

148
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,640
And meanwhile, Volkswagen's US chief
had an apology of his own.

149
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,480
Let's be clear about this.
Our company was dishonest.

150
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,960
And in my German words,
"we have totally screwed up."

151
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,960
Yeah, but "totally screwed up"
are not German words.

152
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,160
The German language
has many beautiful phrases

153
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,240
to describe situations
just like this, such as...

154
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,400
Which means, roughly, "the sadness
that comes from business-related lies".

155
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,600
Or...

156
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,000
Which translates as shaming one's
father, involving clouds of gasoline.

157
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,320
It's a beautiful language.
It just sails off the tongue.

158
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,240
By he way, while that man's apology
may have sounded sincere,

159
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,280
it's worth noting he was speaking
at an official launch party

160
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,960
for the 2016
Volkswagen Passat,

161
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,400
meaning that shortly after saying
sorry, he said this.

162
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,640
Thank you very much for coming.
Up next is Lenny Kravitz !

163
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,400
Ending your apology
with "Up next, Lenny Kravitz,"

164
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,200
does not scream
"sober contrition".

165
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,640
It screams "we asked Bon Jovi
and he said no".

166
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,920
Volkswagen's brand
has been badly damaged,

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,280
and frankly, their new ad campaign
is not exactly helping.

168
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,160
Guten Tag. We at Volkswagen
would like to apologize

169
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,360
for deceiving you
with our vehicles,

170
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,320
which is why the 2015 Jetta
now comes fully loaded

171
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,000
with new,
not-at-all-fraudulent features

172
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,200
such as golden brakes,
the ability to feel human emotions

173
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,240
and a stylish interior

174
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,760
made of 100% ravens' beaks
and pterodactyl skin.

175
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,400
Plus, in a brand-new feature,

176
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,600
if you drive a Jetta off the side
of the Golden Gate Bridge,

177
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,840
you will not die.
That's a Volkswagen guarantee.

178
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,480
And if it's speed
you're looking for,

179
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,280
the 2015 Jetta contains a powerful
2.0 liter TDI clean diesel engine

180
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,480
that will suck your dick.

181
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,880
You heard me right.

182
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,200
The Jetta will bring
your engorged genitals

183
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,960
to a shattering climax.

184
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,480
Also, and we really
mean it this time,

185
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,000
the Jetta is very good
for the environment.

186
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,720
And even if it isn't,
remember, it sucks your dick.

187
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,440
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Lenny Kravitz.

188
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,920
Volkswagen. Hitler trusted us.
Why won't you ?

189
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,240
Moving on.

190
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,560
Our main story tonight
concerns Europe.

191
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,000
You know, that thing
Belgium is in.

192
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,160
If you've watched
the news lately,

193
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,720
you surely know
what has been happening there.

194
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,680
Europe's migrant crisis is
getting worse by the day.

195
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,520
A migrant crisis spiraling
out of control.

196
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,720
Hundreds of thousands of asylum
seekers are risking everything.

197
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,080
A human wave washing up
over Europe's southern shores.

198
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,240
Hundreds of thousands of migrants
have streamed into Europe,

199
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,280
the largest influx there
since the end of World War II.

200
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,560
The largest since
the end of World War II,

201
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,800
and remember,
millions of people back then

202
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,880
were searching both
for a better life

203
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,400
and for the booth where it was rumored
you could slap dead Hitler.

204
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,720
And look, the scale of this story
can be hard to get your head around.

205
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,880
Hundreds of thousands of people
are on the move within Europe,

206
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,640
and another four million are being
hosted in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.

207
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,360
And when numbers get that high,
they can be hard to comprehend.

208
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,240
It's like when someone tells you
the size of the audience

209
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,120
of "NCIS: New Orleans".

210
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,040
17 million people ?
How's that even possible ?

211
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,400
How many navy-based crimes could
there possibly be in New Orleans ?

212
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,040
This doesn't make any sense !

213
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,680
And when you are dealing
with a mass of people that large,

214
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,840
you really want to be a little careful
with how you describe them.

215
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,680
Unfortunately, David Cameron,

216
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,360
noted alleged
swine-fellatio enthusiast,

217
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,480
recently referred to "a swarm of people
coming across the Mediterranean".

218
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,560
And that language matters,
because a swarm of anything

219
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,080
sounds terrifying,
no matter what it is.

220
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,280
If I hear there are a lot
of kittens coming my way,

221
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,960
I'm going to be delighted.

222
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,040
But if I hear there is a swarm
of kittens approaching,

223
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,920
I'm grabbing a shotgun
and I'm getting to high ground

224
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,640
'cause I'm not going to let those
furry fuckers take me alive.

225
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,040
And here in the US,

226
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,200
some in the media have chosen
to reduce the migrant population

227
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,800
to one simple stereotype.

228
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,280
A new video surfaces online
showing why some are worried

229
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,160
Europe is opening its doors
to potential terrorists.

230
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:18,000
Terrorists inbound ?

231
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,280
Those are reportedly Muslim refugees
on a train in Europe,

232
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,880
chanting "Allah Akbar,"
or "God is great".

233
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,040
We're not saying that any
of those people are terrorists

234
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,120
or are affiliated
with a terror group,

235
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,280
but it does highlight just how
many of these refugees

236
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,520
who are fleeing violence
in Iraq and Syria are Muslim.

237
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,480
Okay. First,

238
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,480
you can't claim that you're
not calling those people terrorists

239
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,400
when your lower third says,
"Terrorists inbound ?".

240
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,000
If you're really not saying
they're terrorists,

241
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,080
change that
to something more accurate,

242
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,040
like "people take train".

243
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,200
Or "some wear hats,
others less so".

244
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,720
And second,
describing that as a new video

245
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,160
that sheds light on the migrant crisis
is a little misleading,

246
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,240
because in researching this story,
we found a version of that same video

247
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,480
uploaded onto YouTube
back in 2010,

248
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,520
well before this migrant crisis
even began.

249
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,400
And if you are going to use
misleading old footage

250
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,600
to try and make people frightened
of Muslims, why stop there ?

251
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,560
Just go the whole way and use
a clip from "True Lies".

252
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,800
We're not saying that
any of those people are terrorists

253
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,520
or are in any way affiliated
with a terror group,

254
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,320
but it does highlight just how
many of these refugees

255
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,360
who are fleeing violence
in Iraq and Syria are Muslim.

256
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,600
That's only about 10% more racist
than what you did.

257
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,200
So, let's just
take a step back,

258
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,400
because these people are coming
from many different countries

259
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,760
and fleeing everything from civil war
to economic stagnation.

260
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,480
And while each story is unique,
many of them are heartbreaking.

261
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,560
Noujain is 16
and from Kobani in Syria.

262
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,080
Disabled from birth,
she cannot walk.

263
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,760
She made the dangerous crossing
from Turkey last week.

264
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,880
I've been trying many things
for the first time during this journey,

265
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,040
like a train and a ship.

266
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,280
I just enjoyed it.

267
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,800
- You enjoyed it ?
- Yeah.

268
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,000
You're the first person
I've met who said that.

269
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,240
To understand why, you must know
the world she escaped from.

270
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,400
Imagine you're 16
and you're always afraid

271
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,320
to be dead at any minute.

272
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,200
What is your dream ?

273
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,560
I dream to be an astronaut
and find an alien.

274
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
Yes.

275
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,880
I want to meet the queen.

276
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,520
I think that girl absolutely deserves
to meet an alien and the queen,

277
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,120
and also, if she has time,
a real human with feelings.

278
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,120
But unfortunately for Noujain
and so many like her,

279
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,840
Europe has yet to create
an effective system

280
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,880
to process this influx of people.

281
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,400
Every country has a different
application process

282
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,320
and some are totally overwhelmed
and underfunded.

283
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,800
We actually got our hands
on a couple of registration forms

284
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,960
that were given to refugees
upon arrival.

285
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,520
This one was handed
to a Syrian asylum seeker

286
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,680
arriving in Greece
on September the 5th.

287
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,040
It tells him to return
for registration

288
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,400
on December the 21st,

289
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,640
and that could be
a tricky three-month wait,

290
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,320
because he's not allowed
to work in that time.

291
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,560
And yet, that is nothing
compared to this form

292
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,680
given to an Iraqi refugee
in Turkey

293
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,200
telling him to come back
on June 15th of 2017,

294
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,720
which sounds bad
before you notice

295
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,080
the pink sticky note
added at the bottom

296
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,480
clarifying that his actual date will be
February 19th, 2020 !

297
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,520
And that is ridiculous.

298
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,520
These people can't go
five years without working.

299
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,280
They're refugees,
not Renée Zellweger.

300
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,600
And facing that kind of limbo,

301
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,000
it's no wonder refugees want to try
to push deeper into Europe,

302
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,120
and many of them are heading
for one surprising country

303
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,280
that seems to actually want them.

304
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,600
They keep coming, thousands every day,
at the main train station in Munich,

305
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,600
often greeted by applauding locals
or welcoming volunteers.

306
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,280
It's no wonder that Germany
is the preferred destination

307
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,320
for so many refugees.

308
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,960
Amazingly,
one of the warmest welcomes

309
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,720
on offer to immigrants
comes from Germany,

310
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,320
a country whose idea
of a bedtime story

311
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,160
is two children being left
to die in the forest

312
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,880
before being nearly cooked and eaten,
and then murdering an old woman.

313
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,680
Sleep well.

314
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,240
Unfortunately, many politicians
in other countries than Germany

315
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,320
have been actively hostile

316
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,560
to anyone even considering
settling within their borders.

317
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,160
No way. You will not make
the Netherlands home.

318
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,640
Please don't come. We can't guarantee
that you will be accepted here.

319
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,720
The Danish government
has published these ads

320
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,920
in a number
of Lebanese newspapers.

321
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,480
The text is obviously
written in Arabic,

322
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,320
and it's telling migrants,
"don't come to Denmark",

323
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,080
highlighting the tough regulations
and constraints that await them there.

324
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,400
Denmark is so adverse to taking
people in, it's basically placing

325
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,800
intentionally-missed-connections ads
in other countries.

326
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,720
"Me, Danish government official,"

327
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,080
"you, person in a Lebanese
refugee camp."

328
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,920
"From the moment I saw you,
I knew there was nothing between us."

329
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,320
Perfect. Send.

330
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,960
But even Denmark's
approach seems friendly

331
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,480
next to the video apparently produced
by the mayor of Asotthalom, Hungary,

332
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,960
showing exactly how he
and his police forces would prevent

333
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,160
migrants from coming to his town.

334
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,680
Hungary is a bad choice.

335
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,600
Asotthalom is the worst.

336
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,240
Okay, a few things there.

337
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,080
First, you can add as much
scary music as you want.

338
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,360
There is nothing imposing
about one van driving alone

339
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,080
on a country road.

340
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,320
The only message that
your sending is

341
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,440
"make sure you wait
for that one van to pass by".

342
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,040
And second of all, Mr. Mayor,
you do realize

343
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,160
that border police and nightclub
bouncers are not the same thing ?

344
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,440
Refugees aren't welcome 'cause they
didn't bring enough hot girls ?

345
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,960
And that mayor is no outlier.

346
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,440
Hungary has been responsible for some
of the ugliest mistreatment of refugees.

347
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,480
Disturbing video appears to show
migrants at the main refugee camp

348
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,000
being fed like a herd of caged
animals in a holding pen.

349
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,520
It's a shocking video

350
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,360
that has garnered attention
from around the world.

351
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,440
As waves of desperate migrants
sprint from a holding camp

352
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,880
in Hungary, a camerawoman appears
to trip a man

353
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,880
running with his child
in his arms.

354
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,520
The woman also kicks other
migrants as they run,

355
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,280
including a young girl.

356
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,040
Now, the camerawoman
is out of a job.

357
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,720
I'm sorry.
She lost her job ?

358
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,240
That's absolutely terrible.

359
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,480
I'm sure she can find a new one
on ActualMonster.com.

360
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,800
To be fair, she later
apologized, saying

361
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,320
"I'm not a heartless, racist,
children-kicking camerawoman".

362
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,280
Which I can only presume means

363
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,240
she's a loving, accepting,
children-kicking camerawoman,

364
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,360
because the children-kicking part
is not really up for debate anymore.

365
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,280
And even those countries who
are offering to take refugees

366
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,640
are sometimes making those offers
in the most insultingly selective way.

367
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,280
Slovakians are saying that they're only
gonna give asylum to Christians.

368
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,800
They don't want Muslim migrants
coming into the country,

369
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,680
not least because they
haven't got any mosques.

370
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,680
Slovakia, you can't take Muslims in
because you don't have any mosques ?

371
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,320
You do know
you can build those, right ?

372
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,040
Mosques don't naturally
occur in the wild

373
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,400
due to erosion
or particularly devout beavers.

374
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,720
Muslims can live anywhere

375
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,160
that other humans can live.

376
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,200
Muslims are not like dolphins trying
to resettle in Scottsdale, Arizona.

377
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,880
And when refugees are not being
excluded on the basis of religion,

378
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,240
they're being accused
of being lazy freeloaders.

379
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,680
Just listen to one Polish MEP address
the European Parliament.

380
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,560
If we abolished all benefits,

381
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,000
then people who don't want to work
and want to live from benefits

382
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,400
wouldn't come to Poland
and the rest of Europe.

383
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,560
People who want
to work are precious,

384
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,080
however, they are sent back,

385
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,720
and we accept only those
who don't want to work.

386
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,480
It's a ridiculous policy,
leading to invasion of human trash.

387
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,600
Let us be clear. Human trash.

388
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,120
Human garbage that doesn't
want to work.

389
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,760
"Human garbage" ? Those
are some pretty strong words

390
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,440
coming from the Polish Six-Flags guy.

391
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,600
And what he said is not just offensive,
it's also wrong.

392
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,880
Research has shown
that while there is some small cost

393
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,440
in the short term, eventually
"an influx of lower-wage immigrants"

394
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,000
"into a community tends to raise
wages for everyone else".

395
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,360
And a working paper
published last year found that

396
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,840
"immigration benefited local
populations"

397
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,640
"in 19 of the 20 industrialized
countries they studied".

398
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,800
Adding immigrants makes things
better 19 times out of 20.

399
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,800
That's a success rate matched only
by bacon and Paul Rudd.

400
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,240
And incidentally,
it's just a little hard

401
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,720
to hear these migrants
and refugees being called lazy

402
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,760
considering how hard many of them
have worked to reach Europe.

403
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,040
You really wanna talk
about lazy migrants ?

404
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,720
I'm a lazy migrant !

405
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,000
I left a country by airplane

406
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,480
and the only things
I was escaping were fog,

407
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,120
public indifference
and an almost certain future

408
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,560
as the Turtle
of Prince Harry's entourage.

409
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,560
I didn't want
to be Royal Turtle !

410
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:11,120
And the maddening thing here is
Europe doesn't even need to do this

411
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,920
for good reasons.
It can do it for selfish ones.

412
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,560
Because as a continent,
it is in dire need of new citizens.

413
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,680
According to the UN,

414
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,000
the average woman needs
to have 2.1 children

415
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,240
to maintain the population
of a developed country.

416
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,400
But in the European Union,
every single country is below

417
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,880
that 2.1 level.

418
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,920
By 2050, some countries like
Greece, Portugal and Germany

419
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,200
will see their populations drop
by double-digit percentages.

420
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,320
That's true. If Europe doesn't open
its doors to more migrants,

421
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,600
this is not the changing face
of Europe they should be frightened of.

422
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,200
This is !
This one right here !

423
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:55,160
Not every single asylum seeker is going
to be the perfect economic wellspring.

424
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,320
But instead of worrying about
the hypothetical downside

425
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,480
of letting these migrants in,
countries should be more worried about

426
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,160
the actual downside
of turning them away,

427
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,520
if for no other reason that you might
miss out on someone like Noujain,

428
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,280
who seems like she would improve
any country that would have her.

429
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,000
Just listen to how
she taught herself English.

430
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,200
How did you learn
to speak English ?

431
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,000
At home with my favorite TV show.

432
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,720
- What's that ?
- "Days of Our Lives".

433
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,840
With the Sami and EJ struggle.
Yeah, I love them both.

434
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,480
How can you not want
this girl in your country ?

435
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,080
She loves
"Days of Our Lives" !

436
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,280
She loves "Days of Our Lives,"

437
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,520
and specifically,
she loves EJ and Sami.

438
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,840
In fact, even after
weeks of total hell,

439
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,240
mortal danger
and inhumane treatment,

440
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,400
Noujain's biggest complaint
is that the show killed off EJ,

441
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,960
her favorite character.

442
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,560
She's right to be upset.

443
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,240
EJ and Sami
were magic together.

444
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,720
Yes, you could argue EJ basically
blackmailed Sami into marriage,

445
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,200
then impregnated her,

446
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,720
and then worked for Sami's
archnemesis, Nicole Walker,

447
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,760
who he then also impregnated.

448
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,840
Then he kidnapped Sami's baby
and made her think it was dead,

449
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,240
so Sami shot him in the head.

450
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,640
That's the kind of thing
couples do.

451
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,440
And besides,
they got through all that.

452
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,000
And yes, EJ did then cheat
on Sami before their wedding

453
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,640
with that trollop
Abigail Deveraux,

454
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,360
but he still didn't deserve to die
from yet another gunshot wound.

455
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,880
Even though it was reckless for him
to have a secret meeting

456
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,920
with hillbilly drug lord Clyde Weston
in the middle of the fucking woods !

457
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,080
You idiot, EJ !
How could you die ?

458
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:44,520
You and Sami were so close
to eternal happiness ! Why, EJ ?

459
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,520
My point is...

460
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,480
My point is Noujain
has been through enough

461
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,720
and any country would
be lucky to have her.

462
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,040
And I know lots of people still have
fears

463
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,520
that migrants will
bankrupt social systems,

464
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,920
which many studies show
does not happen,

465
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,200
fears that migrants might have
an ISIS member lurking among them,

466
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,680
which there has been
no credible example of.

467
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,440
No one is saying this is easy,

468
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,480
but the fact it's so hard
is not a reason to do less,

469
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,280
it's a reason to do more,

470
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,400
from countries expediting
their application process

471
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,320
to properly funding the UN High
Commission for Refugees,

472
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,200
whose fund for responding
to Syrian refugees

473
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,760
is less than half
of where it needs to be,

474
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,200
to simply, and I know
this sounds crazy,

475
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,520
just not kicking them
when they're moving around !

476
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,720
It's a crazy idea !
Just rein your leg in.

477
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,640
And there is
actually one final thing

478
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,720
that we thought we could do,
and it is admittedly very small,

479
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,920
and it is for just one refugee.

480
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,240
But for Noujain, who was
so justifiably saddened

481
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,000
by the death of EJ
from "Days of Our Lives",

482
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,320
we made some calls
and we have a surprise

483
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,480
that is literally just for her.

484
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,200
No... No way. No, it's not...

485
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,480
- It's me.
- It can't be.

486
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,880
You're trouble.

487
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,560
It's you !

488
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,720
How is that possible ? How ?

489
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,640
My sister made sure
that I survived the morgue

490
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,440
and then she flew me to Germany, where
my father's witch doctors saved me.

491
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,720
Physically, I've been alive for months,
but it took me a long time to escape

492
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,080
after my... resurrection.

493
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,560
I just can't imagine
how horrible this was for you.

494
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,280
It was nothing.

495
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,080
Coming back from the dead,
that's not hard.

496
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,520
You know what's hard ?

497
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,680
Getting from Syria
to Germany.

498
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,440
Have you seen what those migrants
are going through ?

499
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,840
It's insane. 1 000 dollars to bribe
your way onto a rubber dinghy

500
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,680
to get across the Mediterranean ?

501
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,440
If you make it to the border of Turkey,
they'll offer you an appointment

502
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,760
five years from now.

503
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,040
If you're lucky, you get to navigate
a barrage of bigotry and hatred

504
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,320
from some asshole mayors
in Hungary.

505
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,560
It's horrible.
Someone tripping a child ?

506
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,600
If someone did that to my child...

507
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,120
- You'd slap 'em twice.
- Yeah.

508
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,880
There are some amazing people
coming through that border.

509
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,080
I read about this incredible 16-year-old
girl called Noujain Mustaffa.

510
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,040
- Noujain Mustaffa ?
- Yes, Noujain Mustaffa.

511
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,040
- She's our kind of people ?
- She's our kind of people.

512
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,320
Maybe you'll get
to meet her one day.

513
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,480
But right now, you are
not going anywhere, mister.

514
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,200
If we can raise
EJ DiMera from the dead,

515
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,280
surely anything is possible.

516
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,680
That's our show.
Our thanks to EJ and Sami.

517
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,400
See you next week.
Good night !

518
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,080
