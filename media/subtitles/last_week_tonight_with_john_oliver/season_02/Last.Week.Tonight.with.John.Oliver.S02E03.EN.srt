LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,240
SEASON II, EPISODE 3

3
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,760
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,080
Thank you for joining us.
Time for a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,360
And we begin in Greece,
a country of, and in, ruins.

6
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,640
Greece nearly went bankrupt,
after years of financial mismanagement.

7
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,600
And the rest of Europe
has had to angrily bail it out.

8
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,280
The terms of those loans
were pretty harsh,

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,120
and the new Greek government has
been attempting to renegotiate them.

10
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,120
Greece finally
has the financial lifeline

11
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,640
it desperately needed
to avoid a disaster.

12
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,840
Eurozone negotiators have agreed
to a 4-month extension plan

13
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,280
of the country's $273 billion
bailout program.

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,360
Now that sounds pretty good
but in exchange,

15
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,720
Greece did have to admit that mousakka
is just disgusting potato lasagna.

16
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,000
Nobody wants it.

17
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,560
If you're wondering why Europe agreed
to that deal, it's 'cause they had to.

18
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,880
If Greece collapses,

19
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,240
it may take the whole European
single currency down with it.

20
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,400
A lot depends on Greece
at the moment,

21
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,240
so on Friday, their new finance
minister tried to reassure people,

22
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,120
in the greekest possible way.

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,160
Sometimes like Ulysses
you need to tie yourself on a mast

24
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,360
in order to get where
you're going and avoid the sirens.

25
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,520
We intend to do this.

26
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,080
That's not that reassuring
for two reasons:

27
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,880
first, everybody in Ulysses' crew
dies in that story,

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,160
and Ithaca falls
to absolute shit in his absence.

29
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,360
But secondly:
is that a popped collar ?

30
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,800
Because if you are trying to get
an entire continent to trust you,

31
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,280
it's not a great idea to show up
looking like Pitbull's uncle.

32
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:15,440
For a guy overseeing an economy
on the edge of Armageddon,

33
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,280
he's pretty laid-back.

34
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,240
He was even cracking jokes
in the press conference.

35
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,160
Enough of this self-congratulation.
This is time for work.

36
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,560
I haven't finished.

37
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,200
Be patient. It's a virtue.

38
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,840
Your country is on the verge
of bankruptcy and you're acting

39
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,760
like a strip-club manager giving
a speech at his retirement party.

40
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,080
Enough of this self-congratulation.

41
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,800
The poles are getting cold ladies,
so get back out there, Bambi.

42
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,040
Look, clearly he's a bit slimy.
Here's the problem though:

43
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,320
the whole world's economy
depends on this guy.

44
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,080
And the more you find out about him,
the scarier that seems.

45
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,120
Not his plan nor his left-wing rhetoric
that's got tongues wagging in Europe.

46
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,920
It's his informal style.

47
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,280
In London he unveiled an edgy look,
more biker than finance minister.

48
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,240
What are you wearing ?

49
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,760
Dress for the economy you want,
not the economy you have !

50
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,960
Because if I can just give you
a quick bit of criticism here,

51
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,000
you look like a 50-year-old
molly dealer at a Greek discotheque.

52
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,080
How are we giving this man billions ?
I wouldn't give him 50 dollars,

53
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,840
because deep down, you know
I would never see that money again.

54
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,600
Because that is the face of a man who
would spend it all on scented lube.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,760
That's a fact.
Let's move on to Ukraine,

56
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,600
where tensions with Russia
remain terrifyingly high.

57
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,960
Although there was a cease-fire
last weekend declared,

58
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,000
it was basically violated
almost as soon as it began.

59
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,600
If you are looking for someone to blame
for that, you don't have to look far.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,840
Ukraine claims 20 Russian tanks,
10 rocket launchers

61
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,720
along with troops and supplies
crossed the border into Ukraine.

62
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,400
Russian President Vladimir Putin
remarked today,

63
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,080
no one should have the illusion they can
gain military superiority over Russia.

64
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,680
Yes, Putin says Russia
is unconquerable,

65
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,760
like a doorknob after you've
just put on hand lotion.

66
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,360
Just sit down; you're not going
anywhere for at least 2 minutes.

67
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,520
He's not entirely wrong. It's beginning
to seem the international community

68
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,600
is pretty powerless
to do anything regarding Putin.

69
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,800
Which is why what Egypt
did recently was so delightful.

70
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,680
You may've missed that,
Putin was in Cairo on a state visit,

71
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,720
even presenting the Egyptian
president with an AK-47.

72
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,480
Which is a bit condescending. You don't
give a gun as a gift to a world leader.

73
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,480
You give one to a child in Texas
on his 13th birthday.

74
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,520
We all know how it works.
This is where it gets good:

75
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,640
Egypt decided to honor Putin with
a rendition of his national anthem.

76
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,560
Before I show you what happened:

77
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,280
this is Russia's national anthem
as played at his inauguration.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,840
That's a great anthem.
Stirring, bold, powerful.

79
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,680
This is his anthem,
as played for him in Egypt.

80
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,040
Look how angry he is ! And yet he's
just got to stand there and take it !

81
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,680
Watch and learn,
international community.

82
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,640
Because, to most countries like Egypt,
Putin is unconquerable.

83
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,920
But that does not mean

84
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,800
you can't kick the shit out of his
national anthem in front of him.

85
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,480
And finally: the United Kingdom.
It's having an election in May.

86
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,120
Both parties are campaigning hard,
especially for women voters.

87
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,600
The Conservative Party
has been accused of ignoring women,

88
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,560
so the Labour Party
may have a chance to capitalize,

89
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,520
as long as they don't make
any ridiculous mistakes.

90
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,440
Labour Party has been defending
the color it's chosen for a minibus

91
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,280
which is being used in a campaign
to try to attract female voters.

92
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,160
Deputy Labour Leader Harriet Harman
has defended the decision

93
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,640
to use the color on the vehicle,
nicknamed the Barbie bus.

94
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,840
It is a little insulting that you're
trying to appeal to adult women voters

95
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,320
the same way that Mattel
attempts to appeal to 8-year-olds.

96
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,040
And at least Barbie's pink bus
had the good sense to unfold

97
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,400
into a sweet hot tub
and party den combo.

98
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,120
That thing was sick.

99
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,040
Understandably, this bus has been
more than a little controversial,

100
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,720
with many women in Britain
reacting like this.

101
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,800
We're politically minded, we can
read and we can access information.

102
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,760
I think the pink bus
is a bit patronizing.

103
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,440
A bit patronizing ? The only way
it could be more patronizing

104
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,760
is if its wheels were giant Nuvarings
and they refused to let women drive it.

105
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,280
Now for some reason,
instead of apologizing,

106
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,520
the Labour Party has tried
to deny what color the van is,

107
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,600
insisting it was cerise,
or magenta,

108
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,400
or trying to avoid
the question altogether.

109
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,600
And just so we've got it on the record,
what color is this ?

110
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,040
Hot...

111
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,920
I'll tell you what we've got.
It's like pink, cerise, I don't know.

112
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,400
People will call this color,
it's a version of pink I would say.

113
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,200
I think she may
have just hit rock bottom.

114
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,400
You can see her thinking,
I want to make a difference.

115
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,360
Now I am on television trying to act
like I don't know the color pink.

116
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,280
What happened to my life ?

117
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,640
The Labour Party claimed
this is all part of an effort

118
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,240
to reach out to women
and have a conversation

119
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,640
about the kitchen table,
and around the kitchen table,

120
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,680
rather than having an economy
that reaches the boardroom table.

121
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,160
Women, they want to talk
to you where you are.

122
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,920
Not in a boardroom,
but in a kitchen, or in a Baby Gap

123
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,240
or underneath a giant pile of yarn
and romance novels.

124
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,920
The places you go.

125
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,320
Incredibly, the pink bus
has still not been discontinued.

126
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,320
I'm almost glad that Labour
is not doing damage control.

127
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,360
I'm afraid that, if they did,
it would look like this.

128
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,400
Women of the United Kingdom,
the Labour Party

129
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,640
would like to apologize to you for
our wrong-headed pink van campaign.

130
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,480
We want you to know
that Labour respects you,

131
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,280
which is why this general election
we will focus on the issues

132
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,400
that we know matter to you
and that means - ponies.

133
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,160
Look at the pretty pony. It's a
very pretty pony, isn't it women ?

134
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,600
Like you, Labour
cares about this pony.

135
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,080
We'll brush its pretty pony hair

136
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,120
and before you get offended,
you're right, a pony is not enough.

137
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,160
That's why we dressed the pony up
in a pretty princess outfit.

138
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,720
Princess Pony.

139
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,840
Vote for Labour in May
and if you're very good

140
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,720
we will come to your kitchen and
you can pet the pretty princess pony.

141
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,440
Don't be scared,
she's a nice pony, not a mean pony.

142
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,320
Go on, pet the pony. Do it now !
Pet the pretty princess pony.

143
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,560
Labour cares about women's
issues - all of them.

144
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,960
So when it's time to vote,
remember, you love ponies.

145
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,480
Labour has a pony.

146
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,560
Pony, pony, pony, ponies !
Vote Labour.

147
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,920
Our top story tonight is judges:

148
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,960
wearers of America's
only formal muumuus.

149
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,480
Judges occupy an exalted position
in American life.

150
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,360
As important as they are, we tend
not to think about them very much.

151
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,920
Unless one of them makes news.

152
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,200
A federal court last month lifted
Alabama's ban on same sex marriage

153
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,560
but Roy Moore, the State Supreme
Court's Chief Justice

154
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,400
ordered state judges
to ignore the federal ruling.

155
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,680
Alabama Judge Roy Moore, refused
an order to let gay people marry.

156
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,160
Living up to his state's slogan,
Alabama:

157
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,280
boldly refusing to accept diversity
and the inevitable-since 1819.

158
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,200
But what was his judicial reasoning
for such a decision ?

159
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,320
Gay marriage is an alteration
of the definition of marriage.

160
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,960
The United States Supreme Court
does not have the authority

161
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,560
or the federal courts
do not have the authority

162
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,320
to interpret a word
that disputes Constitution.

163
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,600
Hold on, not only can
the Supreme Court override a state,

164
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,440
that's basically its job.

165
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,720
It's like telling dill it can't ruin
any foodstuff it comes in contact with.

166
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,160
That's what dill does.
Get out of everyone's food dill !

167
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,240
You're filthy weed
you wrecking ball !

168
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,280
You might be thinking,

169
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,680
how did that man get to become the
highest judicial officer in the state ?

170
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,840
Like 85 percent of state judges
in America, he was elected.

171
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,480
39 states hold elections for judges.
US is virtually alone in doing this.

172
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,560
There's only one other country
on earth that does it on this scale.

173
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,320
Guess which ? You're wrong.

174
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,960
It's Bolivia,
a country you think about so little,

175
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,880
you haven't even realize
that's not Bolivia.

176
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,800
This is Bolivia.
Actually that's still not Bolivia.

177
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,760
This is Bolivia. Or is it ?

178
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,040
This game
is never not gonna be fun.

179
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,320
America has been electing judges
since the early 1800s.

180
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,280
And the thing is,
it all began from a good impulse.

181
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,440
Judicial elections
originated as a reform measure

182
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,960
so people were concerned

183
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,520
that you know judges were being
selected behind closed doors.

184
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,800
There wasn't
public accountability.

185
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,120
Okay and public accountability
sounds great !

186
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,080
The problem is, for many judges
nowadays, there's almost none of that.

187
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,960
Most run unopposed.
Last year in L.A. county,

188
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,760
150 out of 151 incumbent
judges ran unopposed.

189
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,200
They could at least
go through the motions

190
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,800
of pretending
there was another candidate.

191
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,080
Just throw a robe on a pelican
and tape a gavel to his wing.

192
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,240
Or I'll tell you what,
you're in L.A. !

193
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,560
Just pretend you're considering
Blake Lively for the job.

194
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,640
Movie studios
do that all the time.

195
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,400
And the problem is, whenever
a judge does face a challenger,

196
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,360
they have to run like a politician.

197
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,280
That's why many states are subjected
to the bizarre spectacle of ads.

198
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,280
Hi, I'm Allen Loughry and I'm
running for our Supreme Court.

199
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,800
It's Loughry as in law and free.
This is my house, come on in.

200
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,840
There's the kitchen,
something smells good.

201
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,000
And my family room,
my wife Kelly Loughry

202
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,080
and our son Justus Loughry.
That's right, Justus Loughry.

203
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,400
Yes sir.

204
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,840
I call my son Justice,
I call my dog, Preamble.

205
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,320
And I call my penis the Gavel.
Vote for me !

206
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,920
And sometimes, campaigns opt
to sell a judge with sheer catchiness.

207
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,040
There's a judge they call Paul Newby.
He's got criminals on the run.

208
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,440
Paul's stares got them running scared
and he'll take them down one by one.

209
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,800
Paul Newby, he's a tough old judge,
respected everywhere.

210
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,800
Paul Newby,
just as tough but fair.

211
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,440
Paul Newby,
criminals best beware.

212
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,120
What just happened ?

213
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,520
Am I supposed to vote for that man, or
root for him to catch them duke boys ?

214
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,840
I know what you're thinking.
Could any commercial be less relevant

215
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,240
to a judge's qualifications
for the job ?

216
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,720
I give you Greg Beard.

217
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,360
Search and rescue in Rapides Parish.
Here's volunteer diver Greg Beard.

218
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,320
We have to know what we're doing,
study, train, trust our team.

219
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,600
We do this
because it helps people.

220
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,960
Greg Beard for Rapides Parish
District Court Judge.

221
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,280
When times are tough,
this dive team stands ready.

222
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,040
Of course, it make sense.
Because when I'm choosing a judge,

223
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,280
the only thing I really care about is
who can hold their breath the longest.

224
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,760
Here's the thing, all three of the men
in those ads won their elections.

225
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,760
They're judges now,
judging people.

226
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,920
And the stupid ads
are actually the least problematic.

227
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,440
What's far more worrisome
is when judges run ads like these.

228
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,200
Without blinking an eye, Judge Kenneth
Ingram sentenced a killer to die.

229
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,200
Michael Oster
is the only candidate for judge

230
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,800
who has put our worst criminals
on death row.

231
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,320
My privilege to sentence you
to life in prison without parole.

232
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,560
Wait, it's your privilege ?
At best, it's your duty.

233
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,480
There are some jobs where that kind of
occupational relish is inappropriate.

234
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,000
At a colonoscopy,
you don't want to hear,

235
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,600
it is my privilege to insert
this camera deep inside your anus.

236
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,240
The problem
with an elected judiciary

237
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,880
is sometimes the right decision
is neither easy nor popular.

238
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,080
Campaigns force judges to look
over their shoulder on every ruling.

239
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,960
While political attack ads
can be aggressive,

240
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,000
judicial attack ads
can be downright horrifying.

241
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,760
I was convicted of stabbing
my victims with a kitchen knife.

242
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,000
Shooting my ex-girlfriend and murdering
her sister in front of our child.

243
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,960
Sexual assault on a mom
and her ten year old daughter,

244
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,800
then I slashed their throats.

245
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,040
Justice Thomas Kilbride sided with
us over law enforcement or victims.

246
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,600
God ! Good luck getting back
into whatever you were watching.

247
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,360
Sheldon and his friends are gonna have
to get into some pretty wacky mishaps

248
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,200
to wipe the memory of that away.

249
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,480
What those evil shadows
are saying sounds awful.

250
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,600
But none of those three men were
actually set free by Judge Kilbride.

251
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,960
But, in each case,
he merely questioned

252
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,960
the legality
of procedural points in their trials.

253
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,960
Which is a judge's job.

254
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,800
But there's no room
in campaigns for nuance.

255
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,680
That's why you don't see
bumper stickers reading:

256
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,840
Justice is complicated, requiring
the sublimation of our baser instincts,

257
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,880
which is the only thing that separates
us from the anarchy of beasts.

258
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,960
The danger though is if ads
like those get inside judges' heads

259
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,000
and make them rule more harshly
to protect themselves in the future.

260
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,320
And the problem is,
that does happen.

261
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,320
Some studies that have suggested
that judges do change their behavior.

262
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,200
In election years, if you look
at judges sentencing decisions,

263
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,640
judges tend to be harder on crime.

264
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,960
That is terrifying. 'Cause you
shouldn't be sitting in a prison going,

265
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,720
"how did you get 15 months
for public urination ?

266
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,680
It was in an election year. Should've
known what I was getting into."

267
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,760
And it's not like appointing judges
is the perfect system.

268
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,680
We can name one that we don't like,
and it's usually Antonin Scalia.

269
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,120
Or... No !

270
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,000
Or in his more palatable form,
a bulldog dressed as Antonin Scalia.

271
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:39,080
Here's the thing, elections
are inherently compromising.

272
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,120
Because campaigns cost money
that has to come from somewhere.

273
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,680
Which leads
to the horrifying spectacle

274
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,320
of judges hitting up
lawyers for donations.

275
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,920
For attorneys like Jules Olsman, this
is the most expensive time of the year.

276
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,480
Election season is when lawyers
have to dig deepest into their wallets.

277
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,680
That's because every hour or so,

278
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,600
he'll get a call from a judge's
campaign looking for a contribution.

279
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,240
- It's very hard to say no.
- It's impossible !

280
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,640
Judges asking lawyers
to give them campaign money

281
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,240
is the definition
of a conflict of interest.

282
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,320
Giving money to judges
wouldn't be acceptable

283
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,000
in a state fair
squash-growing competition.

284
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,200
Gladys gets first place ?
How much money did she give you ?

285
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,440
I know that knobbly pile of shit is not
the nicest squash you've seen today.

286
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,960
It looks like the jolly
Green Giant's dick fell off,

287
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,040
and everyone here knows
it Gladys !

288
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,480
Sometimes, judges will shake lawyers
down after the election is over.

289
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,920
Democratic appeals court Judge
Jim Sharp

290
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,000
sent a passive-aggressive email
to a Texas attorney

291
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,320
who had donated to his unsuccessful
opponent which said,

292
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,240
"I trust that you will see your way
clear to contribute to my campaign

293
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,160
in an amount reflective
of the $2,000 contribution

294
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,040
you made towards my defeat.
wink emoticon."

295
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,680
The fact
that he's shaking him down

296
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,760
isn't even the part of that email
I find most offensive.

297
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,200
It's the wink emoticon.

298
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,560
We should be glad he stopped
short of going full wink emoji.

299
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,320
Incredibly, judges can even target
potential future defendants,

300
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,840
as a Philadelphia Traffic Court judge
candidate named Willie Singletary did,

301
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,000
at a biker rally.

302
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,880
I'm running for traffic court judge.
And I need some money.

303
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,400
I'm gonna tell you all just like this.
I need some money,

304
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:33,280
So if you all could give $20. 'Cause
you all gonna need me in traffic court.

305
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,720
Do all judges do this ?

306
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,240
Are there divorce judges
going to Ikeas right now saying:

307
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,920
"I know some of you won't last.
Who's got 50 bucks ? Cough up."

308
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,960
You'll be glad to hear that
that judge is no longer on the bench.

309
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,040
It wasn't for those contributions,
but rather because he allegedly

310
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,760
once showed cell phone pictures
of his genitals to a colleague.

311
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,800
An accusation that yielded
a disciplinary hearing

312
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,760
whose magnificent opinion featured
the phrase "the judicial penis"

313
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,120
and determined he had intentionally
groomed his penis for photography.

314
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,640
Now that's not really relevant
to the story that I'm telling,

315
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,320
but I think you'll agree:
you had to know that.

316
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,120
You deserve to know that.

317
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,680
And look,
it gets one step worse,

318
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,800
judges also frequently benefit
from campaign money

319
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,480
given by businesses
and special interests.

320
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,120
They may claim
that that doesn't affect them,

321
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,440
but studies
have suggested otherwise.

322
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,880
We looked at the Ohio Supreme Court
and asked the question

323
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,640
of how often they vote for contributors
who appear before them.

324
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,160
And the answer was overall,
about 70% of the time

325
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,400
and in the case of one justice,
Terrence O'Donnell 91% of the time.

326
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,880
Justice O'Donnell
says there is no connection there.

327
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,720
But the point is,
he still said, "sure, why not ?"

328
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,320
in response to people who gave him
money 91% of the time.

329
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,080
And the only other person
who does that is Nicholas Cage.

330
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,120
That's the only...
It's been a disaster, Nicholas.

331
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,920
It's been a romp,
but it's been a disaster.

332
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,640
And to be fair,
many judges don't like this system.

333
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,120
Even Ohio Supreme Court Justice
Paul Pfeifer has said,

334
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,400
"I never felt so much like
a hooker down by the bus station

335
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,720
in any race I've ever been in
as I did in a judicial race."

336
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,440
Which explains Pfeifer's
campaign slogan,

337
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,240
"Justice for all.
No kissing on the mouth though.

338
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,400
I have to save something
for the man I fall in love with."

339
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,080
And increasingly,
since citizens united,

340
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,560
PACS and super PACS
are getting involved.

341
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,360
Remember the banjo ad ? The one
you're still humming in your head ?

342
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,040
That was sponsored by a PAC called
the North Carolina Judicial Coalition,

343
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,280
whose funders included businesses
like R.J. Reynolds.

344
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,640
And remember this one ?

345
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,080
I was convicted of stabbing
my victims with a kitchen knife.

346
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,320
Shooting my ex-girlfriend and murdering
her sister in front of our child.

347
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,360
That was sponsored
by something called "Justpac",

348
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,280
whose donors include Koch industries,
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,

349
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,640
and John Deere PAC.

350
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,440
The people who make tractors

351
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,680
also apparently help make judicial
decisions for the people of Illinois.

352
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,480
When you have a system where
judges are serenaded with banjos,

353
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,360
shake down lawyers for money,
compare themselves to prostitutes,

354
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,000
and live in constant fear of tractors,
you have a problem.

355
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,360
Faith in a strong independent judiciary
is essential for a civilized society.

356
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,880
Without it, we're settling disputes
either in thunderdomes,

357
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,080
or via The Purge.

358
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,880
And I still can't work out how
that thing works. Are any rules ?

359
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,920
A time zone to factor
in The Purge ?

360
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,640
Is the east coast purge an hour
before the purge central time ?

361
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,080
In which case, nobody tweet it.
It spoils it for everyone.

362
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,080
If we're going
to keep electing judges,

363
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,520
we may have to alter
our idea of what justice is.

364
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,000
In fact, at the very least,
to be a bit more representative,

365
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,240
we should tweak the blindfolded
lady holding scales

366
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,080
to put a tip jar in her hand, and give
her a winking emoji for a face.

367
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,080
And now, this !

368
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,720
And now CNN weatherman
Chad Myers hates his job,

369
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,800
his life and everyone around him.

370
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,560
- You look cold Chad.
- I am freezing Carol.

371
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,040
They wouldn't let me
go get my storm gear

372
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,640
so I'm standing here
in a suit and this coat.

373
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,440
Had a little strep throat,
a little cold, maybe some influenza...

374
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,680
Chad Myers we've even called him
in here, this is so big, hi Chad.

375
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,600
You never call me in when
there's actually good weather.

376
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,520
Punxsutawney Phil
may have been right for once.

377
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,560
Hey Chad, Happy Thanksgiving.

378
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,160
I grabbed the short drumstick
and here I am.

379
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,680
Good to see both of you.

380
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,080
They send me to New York
and then they work me to death.

381
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,480
At 6,
I did get coal in my stocking.

382
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,840
Smithsonian says it looks like a cross
between a house cat and a teddy bear.

383
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,800
- My wife already wants one.
- No.

384
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,440
- Would you go with your wife ?
- With a marriage counselor.

385
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,600
They go to Florida and they like it,
my parents were down there.

386
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,760
I was in Detroit and they would
laugh at me all the time.

387
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,120
Let's bring in Chad Myers now.

388
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,800
- You're crying !
- No I'm not crying.

389
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,600
- This is a strong storm. Anderson ?
- Alright, Chad Myers, thanks.

390
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,360
Could you wait until I'm done ?

391
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,120
- Over land it's a tornado ?
- You've been paying attention.

392
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:33,320
And finally, this week
was the Chinese New Year.

393
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,640
Objectively the best new year,

394
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,640
not only because it doesn't
involve Ryan Seacrest,

395
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,920
but because China goes all out.

396
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,080
Across the country people
welcome the year of the sheep

397
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,000
with elabourate light displays,
dancing

398
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,840
and even a fireworks-like
performance using molten iron.

399
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,800
Okay that seems immensely unsafe.
Unless they are killing a terminator.

400
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,880
In which case, by all means,
you do what you have to do.

401
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,320
Yes, this week marked the beginning
of the year of the sheep.

402
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,680
Unless it didn't.

403
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,360
The year of the sheep
and the year of the goat ?

404
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,120
The year of the sheep, goat,
depends on where you're from.

405
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,640
The year of the ram, goat, sheep
whatever you want to call it.

406
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,880
Year of the goat or year of the sheep
depending on which translator you ask.

407
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
That's actually true.

408
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,080
The problem here is,
in the Chinese language,

409
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,160
the same word "yang"
is used for both sheep and goat.

410
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,120
It can mean any hoofed animal
that eats grass and bleats.

411
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,280
Technically, if she was wearing
high heels and eating a salad,

412
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,600
this could be
the year of Stevie Nicks.

413
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:47,120
So the centerpiece
of the Chinese festivities

414
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,720
is their annual New Year's gala,
and it is incredible.

415
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,280
The new year's gala
is an old school variety show,

416
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,200
a 5-hour marathon,

417
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,680
heavy on song, dance
and Communist party style patriotism.

418
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,840
It's a cultural phenomenon in China
drawing more viewers

419
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,760
than the Oscars,
Emmys and VMAs combined.

420
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,000
It doesn't stop there.
'Cause you can throw in

421
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,680
the Super Bowl and the Latin Grammys,
and you're still not close.

422
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,280
700 million people tune
in to the gala.

423
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,720
That's one in every ten people
on earth.

424
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,000
And when you see it,
it starts to make sense.

425
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,160
Opening number alone was quite
possibly the happiest song of all time.

426
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,800
Holy shit that kid is amazing.
See, by the way, see Caillou ?

427
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,040
That's what a bald child
is supposed to behave like.

428
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,080
He's outside, he's living his life.
He's having adventures, Caillou.

429
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,320
Grow up !

430
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,360
That was just the beginning.
The gala also featured

431
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,120
contortionists pouring water
with their feet,

432
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,760
a man chugging rice wine and someone
else spinning around on roller skates

433
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,920
with a child on his head
while a giant robot looks on.

434
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,480
And that alone is China
in microcosm right there:

435
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,440
a gigantic machine
looming over its subjects,

436
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,560
forcing them to be more coordinated
than anyone thought was possible.

437
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,480
The Chinese take their New Year
celebrations very seriously.

438
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,400
When the American consulate
in Hong Kong

439
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,600
put together
a video to celebrate it,

440
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,240
I can only assume
it was equally spectacular.

441
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,960
Consul General Hart,
this year you will learn

442
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,840
the Chinese art of "paper-tearing"
from master artist Lee Sing-Man

443
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,600
in Kowloon Walled City Park.

444
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,880
Awesome ! Let's do it !

445
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,400
Where to CG Hart ?

446
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,120
All right, stop right there !
What the fuck was that ?

447
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,280
Let's pray that no one
in mainland China saw that.

448
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,320
Slapping a pair of sunglasses on
a stuffed sheep seems like an insult.

449
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,760
Even I can do better than that.
Watch I'll do it right now.

450
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,560
Happy New Year !

451
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,680
Please enjoy my articulated mouth
and full range of motion !

452
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,480
The least I can do for a nation which
owns over a trillion dollars of  debt,

453
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,320
to welcome in the year of me.

454
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,400
Wait, excuse me gentlemen.
The year of whom ?

455
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,120
- This is the year of the goat.
- This is not gonna be good.

456
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,200
- This is the year of the sheep.
- No honey it's the year of the goat.

457
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,880
Guys ! This is just
a cultural misunderstanding.

458
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,600
The Chinese language doesn't make
a distinction between the two of you.

459
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,480
We're completely different !
Okay well goats have beards, see ?

460
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,400
See sheepies, they can't grow beards,
they're like Topher Grace.

461
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,920
Okay, fair enough.

462
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,400
- My cheese has vitamin C !
- So what ?

463
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,960
Who eats the cheese
for the vitamin C ?

464
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,560
Fun fact Johnny, I eat tin cans !

465
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,120
- No, that is an urban legend.
- I've done it !

466
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,080
- You calling me a liar ?
- Yes, bring it ! Eat a can !

467
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,200
I know one way you're different.

468
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,560
Only one of you goes well
with mint jelly.

469
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,040
- Fuck you.
- Let's ram this guy.

470
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,520
No guys, guys stop that !
That's our show.

471
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,200
Join us again next week !
Happy year of the goat sheep !

472
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:31,120
Good night. Stop it !
Don't bite. No biting !

473
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,480
END OF EPISODE 3,
SEASON II
