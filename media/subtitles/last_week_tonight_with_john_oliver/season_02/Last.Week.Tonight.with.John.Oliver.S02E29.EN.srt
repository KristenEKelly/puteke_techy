LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,080
Series II
Episode 29

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,800
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,440
Thank you so much for joining us.
I'm John Oliver.

5
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,960
Just time for a quick
recap of the week.

6
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,840
And we start with Russia.
Earth's Death Star.

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,200
Their leader, Vladimir Putin has a
lot on his plate at the moment.

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,320
But this week, he decided
to add one more thing.

9
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,880
Let's get to the breaking news.

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,800
Russia launches its first airstrikes
in Syria

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,000
saying it targeted ISIS
positions near the city of Homs.

12
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,720
One official says the Pentagon was
taken aback by the Russian actions.

13
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,680
That is just what the geopolitical
shit salad that is Syria needed

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,840
a little Russian dressing on top.

15
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,000
If you are wondering why Putin has
decided to intervene in Syria,

16
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,200
there's actually an
interesting theory.

17
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,520
And you can argue in some ways that
what Putin is doing now in Syria

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,360
is a way to distract the
Russian population

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,640
from a combination of its
worsening economy

20
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,040
and from the fact that its forces are
bogged down in Eastern Ukraine.

21
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,680
What ? You can't just bomb Syria

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,360
anytime you need to distract people
from mistakes that you've made !

23
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,040
When Tom Brady was accused of using
deflating footballs,

24
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,880
he did not order
airstrikes on Aleppo,

25
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,040
he screamed into an Ugg boot while
masturbating into a different boot.

26
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,440
Just a normal, healthy
response that he does.

27
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,440
There is some concern about whether
Russia is actually getting involved

28
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,360
to shore up Syrian dictator
Bashar al-Assad.

29
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,600
And one journalist tried to bring
this up

30
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,280
during a photo op with John Kerry and
the Russian foreign minister.

31
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,320
But the question was rebuffed
in memorable fashion.

32
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,800
Secretary Kerry, are you...

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,280
It's politically incorrect for a lady
to address a gentleman on her knees.

34
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,560
Anybody.
Thank you very much good to see you.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,840
Okay, okay.

36
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,440
Two things first, it is a sign of how
few fucks Vladimir Putin gives

37
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,000
that that awful man is one of
his diplomats.

38
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,200
And that is the exact moment that John
Kerry realizes he has a terrible job.

39
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,480
Not only does he have to stop a civil
war from spinning out of control,

40
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,360
but now he has to calm a room that
has just witnessed a foreign minister

41
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,960
attempt to neg a female journalist
into blowjob.

42
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,680
That's a terrible job he has.

43
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,840
So let's move on to the UN.

44
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,040
The sister organization of the
International House of Pancakes.

45
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,160
The UN hosted its general
debate this week.

46
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,000
We don't have time to talk
about all of it,

47
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,480
but there were a few spectacular
moments you may have missed.

48
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,760
First, Robert Mugabe chose to defend
Zimbabwe's laws on homosexuality

49
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,480
with a jarring statement.

50
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,760
We equally reject attempts to
prescribe new rights

51
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,800
that are contrary to our values,
norms, traditions and beliefs.

52
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,720
We are not gays.

53
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,720
We are not gays.

54
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,920
And in case you're wondering, he did
not follow that up by saying,

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,560
"We are not gays because no one is
gay. And no one is straight.

56
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,600
Sexuality is a beautiful spectrum and
any attempt to impose a dichotomy

57
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,560
upon our shared human experience is
both narrow-minded and oppressive."

58
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,000
He did not say that.

59
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,560
That's not how he finished
that thought.

60
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,520
Also, Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu
chose to criticize the assembly

61
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,640
for what he saw as its
indifference to Israel,

62
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,800
by essentially engaging in a staring
contest with the entire room.

63
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,880
The response from nearly every one of
the governments represented here

64
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,440
has been absolutely nothing.

65
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,040
Utter silence.

66
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,920
Deafening silence.

67
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,200
That went on for 45 seconds !
I swear that is true.

68
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,080
And staring at a room for 45
seconds is never a good idea,

69
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,240
because I guarantee you half the
room thinks you're a dick,

70
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,400
half worries you might be buffering,

71
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,760
and one guy is desperately trying to
hold in a fart.

72
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,120
That's what happens in 45 seconds.

73
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,520
But perhaps the strangest moment of
the week

74
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,560
involved Belarusian dictator
Alexander Lukashenko,

75
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,080
who got people talking simply
by how he used his plus one.

76
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,920
This happens to be the contingent
from Belarus.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,400
Explain, who is this young chap ?

78
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,000
This young gentlemen, it looks like
the youngest son

79
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,440
of the President
Lokashenko, Alexander Lokashenko.

80
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,880
Yes, Lukashenko brought his
11-year-old son to the UN.

81
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,520
And why not ? Kids love
the general assembly.

82
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,880
It's like if everyone from the "It's a
Small World" ride at Disney World

83
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,840
came to life and hated each other.

84
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,960
And interestingly, this
is not unusual behavior.

85
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,000
In the past, Lukashenko has brought
his son

86
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,000
to meet the Chinese
president, to meet the Pope,

87
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,320
and even to military parades, where
his son wore a matching uniform,

88
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,480
like a militaristic mini-me.

89
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,880
And if you are thinking, this couldn't
look any more

90
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,160
like the origin story
of a Bond villain,

91
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,000
you're wrong, because here is a photo
of him showing

92
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,560
the former Russian president
his actual golden gun.

93
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,160
Listen, world if we learned one
thing from the UN this week,

94
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,560
it's that we're going to find a way of
paying the trillion-dollar ransom

95
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,240
that this kid is soon going to demand,

96
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,120
or else he kills us all
with his space laser.

97
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,000
And finally, finally this week, we
move on to the secret service.

98
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,480
The only people on earth who can
pull of aviator sunglasses.

99
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,320
Gwyneth.

100
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,600
It's been a rough few years for the
secret service, and unfortunately,

101
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,920
this week, there was
yet another scandal.

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,600
Some new trouble for the secret
service after a review

103
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,600
by the homeland security's inspector
general

104
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,600
found dozens of agents
improperly accessed

105
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,800
Jason Chaffetz's unsuccessful job
application to the agency.

106
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,160
The secret service wanted to embarrass
one of their biggest critics,

107
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,200
Congressman Jason Chaffetz, by leaking
his rejected application to join them.

108
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,400
Essentially behaving like a high
school table of mean girls.

109
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,800
"You only hate us 'cause we won't
let you sit with us, Jason.

110
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,480
Don't look at our food.
You're making it uncool."

111
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:36,160
I don't know what's worse here the
fact the secret service is so petty

112
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,640
that they broke the law to
embarrass Jason Chaffetz,

113
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,120
or the fact that they're so
stupid, they didn't realize,

114
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,160
if you want to embarrass
Jason Chaffetz,

115
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,360
just wait and he will do it for you.

116
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,560
Just this week, he tried to ambush the
president of Planned Parenthood

117
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,240
with a seemingly damaging slide.

118
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,720
And watch how that went.

119
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,680
It's the reduction over the
course of years in pink.

120
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,280
That's the reduction
in the breast exams.

121
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,200
And the red is the increase
in the abortions.

122
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,040
That's what's going on
in your organization.

123
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,880
This is, this is a slide that has
never been shown to me before.

124
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,960
I pulled those numbers directly
out of your corporate report.

125
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,360
My lawyer's informed me that the
source is Americans United for Life,

126
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,400
which is an anti-abortion group.
So I would check your source.

127
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,840
Then we will get to the bottom
of the truth of that.

128
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,840
You want embarrassing ?
That's embarrassing !

129
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,440
And that's a guy who just announced
today he wants to be House Speaker,

130
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,600
and yet his chart was so misleading,
a journalist later pronounced it,

131
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,960
"terrible and dishonest", saying
"this is not how charts work".

132
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:45,520
And it's true his chart doesn't
even have a "Y" axis.

133
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,600
Which means you could literally write
anything down the side of that,

134
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,560
including "total number of angry owls
(in millions)"

135
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,240
or "words ascending
vertically on a line"

136
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,440
and it would make just
as much sense as his.

137
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,680
And you don't even need charts to
embarrass Jason Chaffetz.

138
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,520
You just need to Google him.

139
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,840
We did, and we immediately found this
photo of him and Anthony Weiner,

140
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,440
looking like they're being blown by a
pair of goats,

141
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,520
or, that's just the beginning.

142
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,400
Or there's this video of him taste
testing burgers

143
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,320
on Capitol Hill and saying this.

144
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,320
Just a very plain cheeseburger.

145
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,440
Not much excitement going on
in that meat.

146
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,960
That's funny.

147
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,400
That's exactly what that goat was
thinking when it was blowing you.

148
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,000
Or how about, how about that time,

149
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,440
how about that time in 2009

150
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,840
he got weirdly choked up about the
death of Abraham Lincoln ?

151
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,880
Sadly only six weeks
into his second term,

152
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,240
the president was shot and
killed at Ford's Theatre.

153
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,760
200 years after he was born, this
humble man of great courage...

154
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,280
continues to be one
of our country's...

155
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,400
most beloved statesman.

156
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:16,520
What are you crying about ? It was 144
years ago ! It's time to move on !

157
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,120
He was going to be dead
by now anyway !

158
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,680
My point is, secret service
shame on you.

159
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,800
If you had known anything
about Jason Chaffetz,

160
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,520
you should've already known you
cannot embarrass him

161
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,280
more than he can
embarrass himself.

162
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,160
And now this.

163
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,120
And now people on television talking
shit about their producers.

164
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,600
Piper Line is not well known to a lot
of men,

165
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,720
Jamie Berlin, my producer,
had no idea what it was.

166
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,080
My producer says it's not a record,
but I'm disagreeing with him on this.

167
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,280
I really don't like this stuff but our
producer Anthony Katchaturian

168
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,440
felt it was necessary to put in here.
But really, terrible.

169
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,920
My producer can't fit into this dress.

170
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I wanted to show the cartoons from the
week of the massacre.

171
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,680
Our lily livered executive producer
Tom Johnson wouldn't let us do that.

172
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,400
I did not write this or choose this.
This is all our producer.

173
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,160
My supremely intellectual
producer just whispered into my ear.

174
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,840
My producer's telling me that I
have to go,

175
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,400
and I'm going to take
issue with him later.

176
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,040
My producer has said,
rap in my ear twice.

177
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,560
My producer said that we had to talk
about this for the next minutes.

178
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,960
I do not know who my producer is.

179
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,160
Well that would be I don't even
know who the director is.

180
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,040
Moving on our main story tonight
concerns mental illness.

181
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,240
The thing actors pretend to
have in order to win Oscars.

182
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,960
Now in real life, mental health can
be something of a touchy topic.

183
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,840
We don't like to talk about it much

184
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,720
and as one psychiatrist explains, when
we do, we don't talk about it well.

185
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,040
Stigma still is a very big issue.

186
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,040
It manifests itself in the ways that
we think and talk about the,

187
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,680
the mentally ill and in the terms, the
words, that we use to describe them.

188
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,400
- For instance ?
- Wacko, psycho, cray cray.

189
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,440
Okay, first hearing a bearded middle
aged man use the term "cray-cray"

190
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,440
may have already killed
that word forever.

191
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,840
It's like when your mom says
something is "on fleek".

192
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,680
It's done.
It's just over at that point.

193
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,640
But second he is right.

194
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,160
"Cray-cray" is a terrible name to
call someone with mental illness,

195
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,080
although it is an excellent name for
a cartoon crayfish,

196
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,600
who just won a
scuttling contest.

197
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,360
You did it, Cray-Cray !
You won the race !

198
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,080
The point is, we don't talk
about mental illness well.

199
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,760
Sometimes, even TV personalities with
"doctor" in their names

200
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,360
can get it disastrously wrong.

201
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,920
On the next Dr. Oz...

202
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,200
Everybody wants to know,
am I normal or nuts.

203
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,040
Should you be worried ?
This behavior is ...

204
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,240
it's not normal.

205
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,520
I'm being serious, have you gone
completely insane ?

206
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,800
Completely insane people go outside,
suck on a rock and bark at the moon.

207
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,440
What the fuck is wrong with you ?

208
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,320
"Sucking on a rock
and barking at the moon"

209
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,280
is not a sign that someone is
mentally ill,

210
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,720
it's a sign that they are a wolf
with an iron deficiency.

211
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,520
You're thinking of anemic wolves,
Dr. Phil. You're getting confused.

212
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,480
But the clearest sign of how little we
want to talk about mental health

213
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,840
is that one of the only times it's
actively brought up is

214
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,480
as we've seen yet again this week
in the aftermath of a mass shooting,

215
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,880
as a means of steering the
conversation away from gun control.

216
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,400
This isn't guns.
This is about really mental illness.

217
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,480
In many of these shootings, we have
people who have mental disturbances.

218
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,720
We need to do a better
job in mental health.

219
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,120
You bet we do.

220
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,680
Yes, it seems there is nothing like a
mass shooting

221
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,200
to suddenly spark
political interest in mental health.

222
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,800
Although it's worth noting that
Governor Huckabee's state

223
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,640
got a grade of D-minus on mental
health care while he was in office.

224
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,320
And you can't lecture people on
something you got a D-minus in.

225
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,520
It's like passionately delivering a
speech on proper English grammar

226
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,120
by saying "we need to thunk better
about how we does word stuff.

227
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,880
We need to get it did." And the
aftermath of a mass shooting

228
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,160
might actually be the worst time to
talk about mental health.

229
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,760
Because the vast majority of mentally
ill people are nonviolent.

230
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,080
And the vast majority of gun violence
is committed by the non-mentally-ill.

231
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,880
In fact, mentally-ill people are far
likelier to be the victims of violence

232
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,440
rather than the perpetrators.

233
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,720
The fact we tend to discuss mental
health in a mass-shooting context

234
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,240
is deeply misleading.

235
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,120
If the only time we talked about Coca
Cola, it were in the context of this.

236
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,240
I'm standing here with this ice cold,

237
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,640
thirst quenching, deliciously
satisfying Coca-Cola

238
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,840
and it actually tastes better ! Now
more than ever, Coke is it !

239
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,720
Sure, sure, that happened.

240
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,120
And Coke was, undeniably,
involved in it.

241
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,800
But most cans of Coke
are not that one.

242
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,440
It would be unfair if every time you
thought of Coke, you thought of that.

243
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,720
But if now is our only opportunity to
have a public discussion

244
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,880
about mental
health, then perhaps we should do it.

245
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,520
Because in 2013 an estimated 43.8
million American adults

246
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,080
dealt with a mental illness

247
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,800
and ten million of us suffer from a
serious mental illness each year.

248
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,640
Ten million ! That almost as many
people as live in Greece.

249
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,800
And most of us know
a lot more about Greece

250
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,000
than we know about our mental
health system.

251
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,760
You know at least three things about
Greece its economy is collapsing.

252
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,360
Yanni's from there.

253
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,560
And Greek yogurt tastes like the ice
cream they'd make

254
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,320
in a town where
dancing is illegal.

255
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,880
You know at least three.

256
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,400
If you look at how our current system
deals with severe mental illness,

257
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,600
you'll quickly realize it's a
mess, and it always has been.

258
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,600
We used to lock people up in asylums,
which were often so bad,

259
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,320
they were known as "snake pits"

260
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,080
and that doesn't sound like a great
place, even if you're a snake.

261
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,280
You'd want some kind of snake
loft or snake bungalow.

262
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,880
I'm no real esnake agent.

263
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,840
And then,
and then, in the 1960s,

264
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,360
President Kennedy signed a bill

265
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,880
to try and close as many of those
asylums as possible.

266
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,800
Under this legislation, custodial
mental institutions

267
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,080
will be replaced
by therapeutic centers.

268
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,040
It should be possibly within a decade
or two

269
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,200
to reduce the number of patients in
mental intuitions by 50% or more.

270
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,800
And that was a really good idea.

271
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,120
Because when you see horrible places,
doing unspeakable things to people,

272
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,720
you are supposed to try
and shut them down.

273
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,960
That's why there are
so few Quizno's left.

274
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,640
But before you get too proud

275
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,800
of the fact that we shut those snake
pits down,

276
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,960
it turns out, we never
followed through

277
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,200
and properly funded the community
mental health centers

278
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,160
JFK had wanted
to replace them.

279
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,240
All those patients had
to go somewhere,

280
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,200
and some of the places
they wound up are shocking.

281
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,160
For instance, a few years ago, the AP
found that nearly 125,000 young

282
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,640
and middle-aged mental-health patients

283
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,120
were being placed in nursing homes.

284
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,360
And it's not a great idea to just
stick a young person

285
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,320
in with some old
people and then hope for the best.

286
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,520
That's like casting Taylor Lautner in
the new

287
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,840
Best Exotic Marigold Hotel movie.

288
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,720
It's unsuitable for everyone
involved in it.

289
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,080
And some states have been involved in
something called "greyhound therapy".

290
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,200
And unfortunately, that does not mean
getting to hug a trembling dog

291
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,920
who's 98 percent bone and gristle.

292
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,120
It's an even worse kind of greyhound

293
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,960
the kind with four wheels and a
broken toilet.

294
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,640
This is Rawson-Neal

295
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,320
the only state run psychiatric
hospital in southern Nevada.

296
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,400
Rawson-Neal has been accused
of Greyhound therapy.

297
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,200
A practice critics call unthinkable.

298
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,560
Discharging seriously ill patients
too soon,

299
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,160
then supplying them with a
one-way bus ticket out of town.

300
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,400
You cannot put people you'd rather not
see on a bus to another city.

301
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,920
If you could that's how
every breakup would end.

302
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,240
"Look, Greta.
It's not you, it's me.

303
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,720
I think you'd really enjoy your new
life in Syracuse."

304
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,520
And we have not even got into the
most depressingly common place

305
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,960
that people with mental illnesses can
end up.

306
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,320
Two million people with mental illness

307
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,760
go to state and local jails
every year.

308
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,120
That's meant, there's now ten times
more people behind bars

309
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,520
than in state
funded psychiatric treatment.

310
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,680
That is terrible.

311
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,920
Finding out jails are our largest
provider of mental health treatment

312
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,680
is like finding out Lil Wayne lyrics

313
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,680
are our greatest source of sexual
education.

314
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,240
"No, Darren. You can't 'smack it up
flip it like a spatula'.

315
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,280
Where did you even learn that ? What
does it mean ? Flip it like a spatula.

316
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Would you like if I did that to
your mother ? No, you wouldn't.

317
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,880
You wouldn't Darren.

318
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,880
Look, look using the criminal justice
system to treat the mentally ill

319
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,360
isn't just ineffective it's expensive,
and it is dangerous.

320
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,920
Because often, when someone is having
a mental-health emergency,

321
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,040
the police will be called,
and that can end tragically.

322
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,520
By some estimates, an incredible half
of all incidents

323
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,600
involving the police use of deadly
force involve a mentally ill person.

324
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,840
But some police departments are
changing the way they do things,

325
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,200
even creating special
units like this one.

326
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,240
These officers are experts in what's
called crisis intervention training.

327
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,040
Would you say that you really
don't want to die ?

328
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,360
- But you want the pain to stop ?
- Yeah.

329
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,360
- Are you willing to get some help ?
- Yeah.

330
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,120
This woman agrees to get help.

331
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,720
We'll go in there together.

332
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,800
You'll ride with us.
We're in an unmarked car.

333
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,080
it's all part of a pioneering program

334
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,400
where the mentally ill are diverted
out of jails and into treatment.

335
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,480
Okay well, that seems really good,

336
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,920
but calling it a "pioneering program"
is a little heartbreaking.

337
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,800
Pioneering ideas should not be
completely obvious things

338
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,280
we should've been doing all along.

339
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,000
They should be outlandish things that
push the limits of the possible,

340
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,120
like a fitted sheet that's easy to
fold, or marshmallow airbags,

341
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,000
or a sex doll without
such judge'y eyes.

342
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,120
Don't look at me like that Linda.
I'm lonely and we both know it.

343
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,920
Unfortunately, only 15 percent of law
enforcement agencies

344
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,120
even have crisis intervention training
programs, let alone special units.

345
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,760
And taking that training
is typically voluntary.

346
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,600
And how can something so essential
to your job be voluntary ?

347
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,040
Take the mascot for
the Tampa Bay Rays.

348
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,800
We don't let him decide whether or
not to wear that costume.

349
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,120
Because without it, things
can get ugly fast.

350
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,840
It's important for doing
his job right.

351
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,440
And look that's just a tiny fix.

352
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,960
Our whole system needs a massive
overhaul, which won't be easy.

353
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,680
The public safety net for the mentally
ill spans Medicaid,

354
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,840
which is different across the country,

355
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,040
eight federal agencies who
administer 112 different programs

356
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,760
that in some way touch
on mental health

357
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,880
and the social service agencies in
each of the fifty states.

358
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,520
It is a clusterfuck.

359
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,520
Bu that's an insult to clusterfucks,
because at least in them,

360
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,760
there's the potential
of a satisfying ending.

361
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,120
This is more of a frustrating
cluster-dry-hump of some kind.

362
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,520
And that's not to say there
aren't programs that work.

363
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,800
Let's look at just one, "assertive
community treatment".

364
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,480
It's designed to let those with mental
illnesses live in the community,

365
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,520
by providing regular in-home visits,

366
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,600
and help coordinating assistance in
things like housing and employment.

367
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,640
Listen to one social worker
explain how it can work.

368
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,240
What makes mental health might just
not be a visit to your psychiatrist,

369
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,840
it might also mean having
your entitlements in place.

370
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,320
Or it might mean having
your rent paid on time.

371
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,480
So instead of meeting with a person
and talking about how they're doing,

372
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:44,360
how they feel, once a month
or twice a month,

373
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,480
what we do is everything

374
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,800
that it takes to keep people in the
community living independently.

375
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,600
That's fantastic.

376
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,000
"Everything it takes" sounds like a
much better option

377
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,560
than what we've apparently been
trying, which is "nothing",

378
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,400
"not anything," "very few things,"
"not much", and "prison".

379
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,520
But in many states assertive community
treatment programs are in jeopardy

380
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,000
thanks to everything from budget cuts
to Medicaid reimbursement problems,

381
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,040
despite the fact a study found these
programs pay for themselves.

382
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,840
Which is fantastic.

383
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,960
Government programs are like graduate
students on a first date

384
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,440
if they are able to pay for
themselves, it's a fucking miracle.

385
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,040
And look again that's
just one program.

386
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,640
There are many more, designed for
many different levels of need,

387
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,960
and as a society, we have to
figure out how to fund them.

388
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,720
Not just cause it makes fiscal sense,
but because it would save lives.

389
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,440
And there are some politicians

390
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,680
who claim to be pretty motivated to
address this problem.

391
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,680
This isn't guns.
This is about really mental illness.

392
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:51,080
In many of these shootings we have
people who have mental disturbances.

393
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,640
Do we need to do a better job in
mental health ? You bet we do.

394
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,720
Okay, fine.
Do it, then.

395
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,720
Because if we're going to constantly
use mentally ill people

396
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,880
to dodge
conversations about gun control,

397
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,400
then the very least we owe
them is a fucking plan.

398
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,960
And now this.

399
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:12,280
And now, newscasters stretching the
definition of the word "exclusive."

400
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,880
Kelly File exclusive.
Kim Davis will talk to us.

401
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,200
One day earlier

402
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,800
An ABC news exclusive, one
on one with Kim Davis.

403
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,920
Joining us live for an exclusive
morning interview.

404
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,200
9 hours earlier

405
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,920
Welcome Senator Rand Paul.

406
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,800
An exclusive interview
with Donald Trump on Morning Joe.

407
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,000
6 hours earlier

408
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,120
The polls have been amazing.
Just amazing.

409
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,200
8 hours earlier

410
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,400
Your wonderful show
that I love so much.

411
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
And 15 hours earlier

412
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,400
- We appreciate your time.
- Thank you very much.

413
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:46,040
Moving on.
Finally tonight social media.

414
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,200
That thing Cher almost understands how
to use. Almost.

415
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,360
This week, a new social-media
app got a lot of attention.

416
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,920
It's apparently like Yelp for people.

417
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,720
A new app called Peeple
with a double E,

418
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,760
allows you to rate and review every
person you know

419
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,440
using a one to five
star rating scale.

420
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,600
Friends ,coworkers, romantic
partners, even your exes.

421
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,520
Wait, that sounds absolutely awful.

422
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,000
Yes, there is apparently a new app
coming out

423
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,680
that's being labeled as
"Yelp for people."

424
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,160
And it's the kind of bullshit
mash-up that Silicon Valley loves.

425
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,280
Like "Snapchat for music," or "Skype
for sandwiches,"

426
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,880
"Tinder for geese,"
"Shazam for Kazaam,"

427
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,080
and "Uber drivers for scuba divers."

428
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,800
As you might expect an app that allows
people to rate you as a human being

429
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,320
without your consent has been
met with some concern.

430
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,880
But its creators frankly
do not understand why.

431
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,920
We want to clarify that this isn't,
this isn't like a judging website.

432
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,840
We don't want to, we don't want to
judge in a,

433
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,280
in a sense of, uh, being mean

434
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,560
or, you know, we want to actually,
like, bring the better out in people.

435
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,600
We want to be given the opportunity to
prove to you

436
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,000
that the world is
predominantly good.

437
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,320
Filled with people that absolutely
love you and want to lift you up.

438
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,600
I'm sorry have you ever
been on the internet ?

439
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,640
It's basically, the internet, let
me try and explain to you what it is.

440
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,120
The internet is basically a faucet

441
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,000
that dispenses hate, racism, and the
occasional sad orgasm.

442
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,480
And yet, the creators of this app

443
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,040
remain completely oblivious to its
lack of appeal.

444
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,640
Watch this video that
they themselves posted

445
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,040
of them pitching their app to
a cab driver.

446
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,000
We're building a Yelp for people

447
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,760
where you can actually go in our app
and rate

448
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,680
and comment on anybody you know

449
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,320
professionally, personally
or romantically.

450
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,880
What do you think ?

451
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,600
Wow, right ? That's a good reaction.

452
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,840
Wow is a, that's a start.

453
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,120
- That's a, that's a reaction.
- Yeah.

454
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,800
Oh, that is not a good reaction.

455
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,880
When you tell someone your idea,
you don't want them to respond

456
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,680
with the sound of the soul
leaving the body.

457
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,440
But wait, but wait it gets better.

458
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,040
As backlash to the app started
spread this week,

459
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,440
in what I'm sure
is a complete coincidence,

460
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,960
one of the app's
founders took to Facebook to ask,

461
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,200
"anyone know how to prevent people
from posting on the comments

462
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,200
of a company Facebook page ?"

463
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,000
That's right, the creator of an app

464
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,000
that would allow people to give each
other unsolicited criticism

465
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,960
wants to block unsolicited criticism.

466
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,560
She's opposed to the very
core of her own idea.

467
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,160
It's like if the CEO of Airbnb hated
sleeping on strangers' semen.

468
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,320
It would make no sense, that's
what his business is.

469
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:56,560
And that illustrates the main problem
here the internet essentially exists

470
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,560
so that people can say vicious
things about each other.

471
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,480
And we don't need another
app to facilitate that.

472
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,880
What we need is something which helps
stop people from getting hurt.

473
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,120
That is why we have launched a new,
actual website

474
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,920
called "scream into
the void dot com".

475
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,200
It gives you all the catharsis

476
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,000
of typing hateful things about people
into the internet,

477
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,400
with none of the human consequences.
I'll show you how it works.

478
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,120
The way it works is, you simply type
whatever awful thing you're thinking,

479
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,200
hit the button at the bottom of
the page,

480
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,840
and the message will be
deleted forever.

481
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,480
It's brilliant.
It's brilliant.

482
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,840
It feels good to get it out
and no one has to hear it.

483
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,000
I encourage you to use it.

484
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,400
And if you still somehow feel an
inexplicable desire

485
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,080
for an app that will judge you,

486
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,800
we'd like to introduce you to an
even less harmful alternative.

487
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,960
Nowadays there's an
app for everything.

488
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,840
There are apps to let people
rate restaurants, hotels,

489
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,760
and now because the world is a
ceaseless nightmare,

490
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,480
there are apps
that let people rate each other.

491
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,160
And look, no one wants to be
rated by random people,

492
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,720
you want to be rated by
someone you can trust.

493
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,440
That's why we're launching - Peeble.

494
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,880
The only app where you can be rated by
actor, director,

495
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,720
and producer, Mario
Van Peebles.

496
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,800
This sister is mysterious
I like it. Four stars.

497
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,960
Can you get hepatitis from
a picture ? One star.

498
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,960
And that's a five star cat
with a three star guy.

499
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,320
Getting started with Peeble is simple.
Download the app.

500
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,920
Upload a photo of yourself

501
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,080
and wait for Mario Van Peebles to
assign you a rating from 1 to 5 stars

502
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,240
based on his initial
impression of you.

503
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,960
I can tell that girl gets it.
Four stars.

504
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,920
Zero stars.

505
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,840
Is that Steve Buscemi ? I think
that's Steve Buscemi.

506
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,760
Peeble, it's like Yelp
for Mario Van Peebles.

507
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,040
Oh, that's a pug dressed as a pumpkin.

508
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,880
Four stars.

509
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:58,800
That is no dumber an idea than that
stupid "Peeple" app.

510
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,680
Thank you so much for watching the
show. Our thanks to Mario van Peebles.

511
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,600
We'll see you all next
week, good night !

512
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,240
Trying too hard. Two stars.

513
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,720
Nah, not trying hard enough. Two
stars.

514
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,320
She got a bad attitude.
Four stars.

515
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,840
Now this is a bastard right here.
Two stars.

516
