00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,360
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
With John Oliver

2
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,120
Episode 21

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,160
Welcome, welcome, welcome to Last
Week Tonight. I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,960
Thank you so much for joining us.

5
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,920
Just time for a quick recap
of the week.

6
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,200
It has been dominated by America's
relationship with Iran.

7
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,640
It's the "Star Wars" of international
relationships good in the seventies,

8
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,040
terrible for a long time, and now,
hopefully, on the brink of a revival.

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,640
Because this week,
we got some major news.

10
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,920
Today President Obama announced
an agreement he says will keep

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,360
an atomic bomb out of Iranian hands
for more than a decade.

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,920
This deal offers an opportunity
to move in a new direction.

13
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,760
We should seize it.

14
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,760
Wow, you can tell the president
means business because he's speaking

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,240
from the "I killed Bin Laden

16
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,000
and threw him in the ocean" wing
of the White House.

17
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,160
And you can tell that Biden means
business because he is locking eyes

18
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,240
with the camera like a silverback
gorilla who thinks you're challenging

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,840
his alpha status.

20
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,080
"You wanna dance, motherfucker ?
Iran's not going nuclear,

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,480
but Joey B might. Do you want
to dance with me ?"

22
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,680
In his address, the president wanted
to make it clear,

23
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,760
just because he was making
a deal with Iran,

24
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,920
did not mean he fully trusted them.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,080
This deal is not built on trust.
It is built on verification.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,560
Inspectors will have 24/7 access
to Iran's key nuclear facilities.

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,800
And that's a reasonable request.
After all, Iran developed

28
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,480
nuclear facilities in secret, and then,
when they were discovered, claimed

29
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,760
they were for civilian purposes.
Which is a bit like having

30
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,680
your girlfriend discover your real doll
and saying "wait, what ? I'm getting

31
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,960
my lifeguard certification,
and they require that your CPR dummy

32
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,200
have a medically accurate anus
and vagina. I'm allowed this."

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,200
And it's perhaps that lack of trust
which is why the terms of this agreement

34
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,520
are so severe.

35
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,640
Iran will remove two thirds of its
installed centrifuges.

36
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,840
Iran will not use its advanced
centrifuges to produce enriched uranium

37
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,120
for the next decade. Iran will
also get rid of 98 percent

38
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,840
of its stockpile of enriched uranium.
That stockpile will be reduced

39
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,800
to a fraction of what would be
required for a single weapon.

40
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,160
Yes, if they obey the terms of the deal,
Iran won't have enough material

41
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,800
to make a single bomb. And if you're
wondering if they could make

42
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,800
one really teeny bomb that they could
strap to a suicide hamster

43
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,120
and use to blow up a mailbox,
well no. We asked. And no.

44
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,840
They can't do that, it's, they
can't do it. We did ask though.

45
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,080
There was actually a good reason
the president was making a hard sell

46
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,040
for this deal he knew
that there were some who

47
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,880
within hours of the deal being
announced simply would not be able

48
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,960
to wait to start criticizing it.

49
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,800
This is a bad deal.
The worst possible outcome,

50
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,320
is you've created a nuclear arms
race in the Mideast,

51
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,560
you put Israel at risk and you
put us at risk.

52
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,080
The only other thing that I would
add is that we don't know

53
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,560
all the specifics to this plan.

54
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,360
- That's true.
- You yourself haven't read anything...

55
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,480
That's true.

56
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,480
He hadn't read it !

57
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,480
Lindsey Graham is discussing the Iran
deal the way a four year old talks

58
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,800
about broccoli. "It's disgusting.
It's the worst food in the world."

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,400
"Have you ever tried broccoli ?"
"No. I have not, but I know I hate it."

60
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,880
And Lindsey Graham, to be fair, wasn't
alone in criticizing the deal

61
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,880
based solely on what he thought
it contained.

62
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,920
The deal that we have out there,
in my view, from what I know of it

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,680
thus far, is unacceptable. If, in fact,
it's as bad a deal as I think it is

64
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,640
at this moment, we'll do everything
we can to stop it.

65
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,120
Wait, as bad as you think it is ?

66
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,200
That is a clear sign that you didn't
do the reading. It's like,

67
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,600
it's like starting a book report
"some of us are of mice

68
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,000
while other are of course.. of men.

69
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,800
There have been many good Gatsbys
in history, but only one

70
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,680
that I would call the Great Gatsby."

71
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,680
The things is, how can you not read
this deal before commenting ?

72
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,360
It's only 159 pages long, and much
of that is lists and preamble.

73
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,120
The actual meat of the agreement
is about 90 pages, making it

74
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,040
around half the length of "Babysitter's
Club" number one "Kristy's Great Idea."

75
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,320
I'm not saying the deal is perfect.
I'm just saying,

76
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,320
think of the nuclear agreement
with Iran as a calzone.

77
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,840
It could contain a lot of things from
cheese, marinara sauce

78
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,080
to a dead mouse.

79
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,040
But the point is, you don't get
to complain about what might be inside

80
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,200
unless you have fucking looked.

81
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:14,880
So let's move on now to Mexico.
Or, as you may know it, spicy Canada.

82
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,040
Last weekend, Mexico's leading drug
boss, Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman,

83
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,760
escaped from prison. Just wait until
you hear the details of how he got out.

84
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,680
Mexican government taking ABC News
through the now notorious tunnel

85
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,800
running nearly
a full mile underground

86
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,840
from the shower
in El Chapo's prison cell

87
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:40,000
all the way to a half built house used
to hide an estimated 379 truckloads

88
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,200
of dirt pulled out of the ground
to make that tunnel. Look closely.

89
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,520
You can see rails. Authorities finding
this modified motorcycle down below,

90
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,840
as well.

91
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,680
Listen, listen, I know El Chapo is
a bad man, but that is incredible.

92
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,040
He escaped through a literal
underground railroad,

93
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,280
built using a tiny motorbike.

94
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,440
The plan he designed
when he was 12 worked.

95
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,480
Now clearly, clearly the Mexican
authorities have some serious questions

96
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,760
to answer, especially considering this
could hardly have been a surprise.

97
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,280
He is and has been known for years
as the tunnel specialist.

98
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,720
He has been known to bring
sophisticated equipment, engineers

99
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,000
and others, to build tunnels on
the US-Mexican border for years.

100
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,360
Perhaps it was so obvious that they
just discarded it as a possibility.

101
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,000
That's the point. Of course El Chapo
was going to escape through a tunnel.

102
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,400
It's as inevitable as Wes Anderson's
next movie featuring

103
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,800
an eccentrically dressed Bill Murray,
a Kinks soundtrack

104
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,600
and the memory of how much you liked
"Rushmore." It's going to happen !

105
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,800
And look, if you're thinking, "well,
sure, they knew he liked tunnels,

106
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,160
but how could they possibly have known
he would dig one under his bathroom ?"

107
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,560
This is how he escaped the Mexican
military just a year and a half ago.

108
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,560
When they got inside, El Chapo
was nowhere to be found.

109
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,160
But they did find this....

110
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,880
The tub. Look at this.
The escape hatch

111
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,040
Underneath is the
entranceway to a hidden tunnel.

112
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,080
He escaped through a bathroom
based tunnel ! Come on, Mexico !

113
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,480
You have to know, you cannot allow
this man near plumbing.

114
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,320
You can't allow it.

115
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,120
And you don't even need his past
history to know that. Look at him !

116
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:38,720
He is just one M on his hat away from
looking like a psychopathic Super Mario.

117
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,000
You have to see it coming.
And finally,

118
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,800
finally this week North Korea,
earth's Florida.

119
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,360
Next month, is the 70th anniversary
of Korea's liberation day,

120
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,320
the date marking the end
of Japanese colonial rule.

121
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,040
The big question is, what do you get
the country that is ordered

122
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,280
to think it has everything ?
Apparently, Kim Jong Un has decided

123
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,240
that for the first time ever
a foreign rock band will play there.

124
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,880
So who's it gonna be ?
Rolling Stones ? U2 ?

125
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,600
A Michael Jackson impersonator
passed off as the real thing,

126
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,720
'cause North Koreans don't know
he's dead yet ? Well, well no.

127
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,360
Because it turns out it's going to be
and this is true,

128
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,280
a Slovenian art rock group
called Laibach.

129
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,120
If you're not familiar with them,
this is the happy celebratory music

130
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,400
that North Koreans will be listening
to on their special anniversary.

131
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,560
Europe is falling apart.

132
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,960
Europe is falling apart.

133
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,640
Europe is falling apart.

134
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,600
Happy liberation day, North Korea.

135
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,440
Sleep well.

136
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,320
Look, Laibach might
seem like an odd choice.

137
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,240
But you can understand what
totalitarian dictator Kim Jong Un

138
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,200
might see in them, when you watch
their video "Dance with Laibach".

139
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,880
We dance with fascism
and red anarchy.

140
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,560
Give me both your hands
one, two, three, four.

141
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,920
Of course Kim Jong Un loves this
band ! That video is basically

142
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,280
his answer to, "where do you see
yourself in five years ?"

143
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,360
"I dunno, probably leading a skeleton
army into battle if all goes well."

144
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,880
Now, you probably won't be surprised
to learn that Laibach has been accused

145
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,520
of glorifying fascism in the past,
to which their response has been

146
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,200
"we are fascists as much
as Hitler was a painter."

147
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,920
Which I assume means they are
fascists, they're just very bad at it.

148
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,520
But before you worry that their music
might be too much of a downer

149
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,360
for the people of North Korea,
please know that Laibach

150
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,600
promised the program will also feature
and this is true,

151
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,120
them reinterpreting songs
from the "Sound of Music."

152
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,240
Which, yes, sounds a little weird,
but it actually wouldn't be

153
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,440
the first time they've brought
that fun Laibach touch

154
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,800
to other people's music. I give you
their absolutely inexplicable cover

155
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,840
of "Sympathy for the Devil."

156
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,880
Pleased to meet you,
Hope you guessed my name.

157
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,200
But what's puzzling you
Is just the nature of my game.

158
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,600
Finally we have an answer to the
question what if Freddie Mercury

159
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,680
was trapped in a cave, had just
swallowed a frog,

160
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,760
and was trying to sing it out ?
I have got to say

161
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,760
North Korea seems like
a terrifying place to visit.

162
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,200
But if it is really true that
that guy is going to be singing

163
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,600
"the Sound of Music"
I kind of want to go there.

164
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,840
I need to hear him bark about
whiskers on kittens. And now this.

165
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,040
And now, CBS This Morning's
awkward sex talk.

166
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,840
Men average about 14 sexual partners
during their lifetime

167
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,320
and women average about 8.

168
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,320
Do those numbers seem
about right to you guys ?

169
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,880
Charlie says look, I only have
ten fingers and ten toes.

170
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,040
That's not right.

171
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,120
- No, Charlie says I'm not going there.
- Oh okay.

172
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,760
It is hard to cover both boobs with
one arm. Try that, that's a sport.

173
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,080
Depending on the size
of your boobs, actually.

174
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,200
Do you have a comment, dear ?

175
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,600
No.

176
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,960
If you have sex on the first date,
do you think less of a person

177
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,480
who has sex with you
on the first date ?

178
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,240
- No !
- You don't ?

179
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,840
For most men, their definition of great
sex is if their partner says

180
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,360
that was great sex.

181
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,880
It's true.

182
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,200
- Is that true ?
- No.

183
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,560
Charlie, don't you like a girl in
wings ? I need to get me some wings.

184
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,040
- I like a girl in Victoria's Secret.
- Okay. That works too.

185
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,480
Moving on our main story tonight
concerns food, or as plants and animals

186
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,560
might call it, the afterlife.
We love food in America.

187
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,800
As you would know, if you've ever
turned on a television set.

188
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,840
IHOP all you can eat pancakes
are back.

189
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,320
Introducing all you can eat wings !

190
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,360
Only at Golden Corral !

191
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,160
Everyone's favorite endless shrimp
is back ! People wait

192
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,320
for this promotion all year long.

193
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,000
Riblets, riblets, riblets !
Applebee's has riblets !

194
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,400
All that you can eat now riblets !

195
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,800
"Sadness, sadness, sadness !
Let food replace your sadness !

196
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,600
Stuff riblets in that hole
in your heart !"

197
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,200
That's a catchy way to sell
hog scraps hidden in barbecue sauce.

198
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,880
In fact, celebrating America often
goes hand in hand

199
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,400
with celebrating its food. Watch this
actual commercial running right now.

200
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,600
What's more American than
a cheeseburger ? This cheeseburger.

201
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,600
Loaded with a hotdog and potato chips.

202
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,680
In the hands of all American model
Samantha Hoops. In a hot tub.

203
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,200
In a pickup truck. Driven by
an American bull rider.

204
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,920
On an aircraft carrier. Under the gaze
of Lady Liberty. As she admires

205
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,920
the most American thickburger.

206
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,880
New at Carl's Jr. and Hardee's.

207
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,440
Wow! A cheeseburger with hot dog
and potato chips.

208
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,360
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
the new Confederate flag.

209
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,680
She's majestic.

210
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,640
But this is not a story
about the food we eat.

211
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,680
It's a story about the food
we don't eat. Because there is

212
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,640
a surprising amount of it.

213
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,480
A report by the Natural Resources
Defense Council says that

214
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,560
as much as 40% of all food produced
in the United States never gets eaten.

215
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,640
Americans throw away 165
billion dollars worth of food

216
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,960
every year. That's about twenty
pounds per person every month.

217
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,040
Americans throw away enough food
every year

218
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,320
to fill 730 football stadiums.

219
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,840
Food waste is like the band Rascal
Flatts it can fill a surprising number

220
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,800
of stadiums even though many
people consider it complete garbage.

221
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,000
Between producers, sellers and
consumers, Americans are throwing out

222
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,840
a third or more of our food.
The amount we throw out has increased

223
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,280
by around 50 percent since the 1970s.
At this rate, in 40 years,

224
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,040
when you order pizza from Dominos,
they'll just deliver it

225
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,880
straight to the nearest dumpster.
As they should,

226
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,720
but that's not the point here.
And if you think that this sounds bad,

227
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,600
just wait until you see how it looks.
Check out this waste dump

228
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,120
in California's Salinas Valley.

229
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,400
We got a whole load pretty much
of loose organic lettuce.

230
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,160
We've got spinach towards the back.

231
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,800
Looks like it's perfectly fine,
nothing wrong with it.

232
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,680
We got some, some kale here. We got
broccoli in the back as well.

233
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,480
We have plenty of produce
to make a salad here.

234
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,520
Oh, not just a salad. You could make
a significantly better salad

235
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,280
than the salads they actually
sell at McDonalds,

236
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,400
which look like the trimmings in
Ronald McDonald's lawnmower mixed

237
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,560
with grimace ejaculate.
And the thing is,

238
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,280
watching all that food go from
farm to not a table

239
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,920
is awful for a bunch of reasons.
First, and most obviously,

240
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,200
there are many people in this country
who need that food.

241
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,760
In 2013, nearly 50 million Americans
lived in food insecure households,

242
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,600
meaning that at some point in the
year, they struggled to put

243
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,000
enough food on the table. The fact
that we throw away a third of our food

244
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,680
gets pretty alarming when you hear
from some of those people.

245
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,440
It's hard. I'll go without food
before my kids will.

246
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,680
Budget is down to the penny
and it's just not enough still.

247
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,800
- It brings you to tears.
- Yeah.

248
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,200
- Why ?
- It's just hard.

249
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,240
They're so young and it's hard.

250
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,120
It is crazy that that is happening
in a country with 730 football stadiums

251
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,960
full of uneaten food. It's insane.
But there are also other,

252
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,680
less obvious consequences
to discarding food. For a start,

253
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,680
we're wasting all the labor and natural
resources that went into making it.

254
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,160
And at a time when the landscape
of California is shriveling up

255
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,280
like a pumpkin in front of a house
with a lazy dad,

256
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,760
it seems especially unwise that
farmers are pumping water into food

257
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,640
that ends up being used as a garnish
for landfills. Because those landfills

258
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,160
go on to cause problems of their own.

259
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,520
If you were to throw an apple core
out just out into the woods,

260
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,840
it's not a big deal. The problem comes
when all of that waste is aggregated

261
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,320
and it decomposing without air
in a landfill.

262
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,560
That anaerobic condition is what creates
methane, which is a greenhouse gas

263
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,880
that's more than 20 times
as potent as CO2 at trapping heat.

264
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,280
That's right when we dump food
into a landfill,

265
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,840
we're essentially throwing a trash
blanket over a flatulent food,

266
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,720
man and Dutch oven'ing the entire
planet. And if you're thinking,

267
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,000
"but hold on, John, what if I'm
an asshole who couldn't give a shit

268
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,720
about America's hungry families or the
long term viability of life on earth ?"

269
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,600
Well, first, let me say, Mr. Trump,
thank you so much for taking the time

270
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,400
to watch this show tonight.
It's lovely to have you with us.

271
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,960
And secondly, don't worry there is
a selfish financial reason

272
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,080
for you to care about this story,
too.

273
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,560
In our households, we're wasting
between 15 and 25 % of the food

274
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,680
that we're buying. That's expensive.
Imagine walking out of a grocery store

275
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,440
with four bags of groceries,
dropping one in the parking lot

276
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,080
and just not bothering to pick it up.
That's essentially

277
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,320
what we're doing in our homes today.

278
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,840
And that's not good. When you're
throwing away that much food,

279
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,440
you're not just being wasteful,
you're wining and dining raccoons.

280
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,160
"This is absolutely lovely !
Thanks for this !

281
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,560
We needed a break from the kids !"

282
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,800
And look, it's a good thing
so many of us have access

283
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,720
to plenty of relatively
inexpensive food.

284
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,960
I love that we live in a country with
with Cap'n Crunch, Peanut butter crunch,

285
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,800
Chocolatey crunch, Sprinkled donut
crunch, Cinnamon roll crunch,

286
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,560
Christmas crunch
and Halloween crunch.

287
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,000
I will even defend Oops All Berries
Crunch a cereal so unnecessary

288
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,560
that its actual name includes
an apology for its existence.

289
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,720
But it does seem like our food
wastage is getting to a critical mass.

290
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,160
And so much of it stems from our
own habits and misconceptions.

291
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,000
For instance stores big and small
often routinely overstock,

292
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,520
so that you can walk
in and see tons of food there.

293
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,760
Because if they don't that, as this
small farm stand operator describes it,

294
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,600
we might not buy anything.

295
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,600
If this is what I had and there was
an hour left in the market.

296
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,280
That one bunch of chards would sit
there and no one would buy it.

297
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,640
But if I had 30 bunches of chard
all like bursting out,

298
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,960
I'd probably sell like 25 of those
bunches of chard. What does that say ?

299
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,480
People are totally impulse shopping.
And they think if there's one left,

300
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,480
that there's something wrong with it.

301
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,960
It's true. I wouldn't buy that chard.
Partly because it's chard,

302
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,800
but mainly because we naturally assume
the last option is a bad option.

303
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,680
Which, in many contexts,
is absolutely the case.

304
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,080
For example you don't want the last
magazine in the doctor's office,

305
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,280
because it's always "Golf Digest".
Always.

306
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,840
And no one has ever read "Golf Digest."
It's not even a golf club in his hand,

307
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,400
but no one noticed,
because it's on "Golf Digest."

308
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,880
But when it comes to produce, the last
option is probably completely fine.

309
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,920
Especially because, as another farmer
explains, even slightly sub par fruits

310
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,880
and vegetables don't make it
to the produce aisle.

311
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,720
Every time that the people are picking,
they'll have a few they throw

312
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,800
on the ground, because there's always
a few that aren't quite perfect.

313
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,400
This is a perfectly good peach.
Right on the ground like this.

314
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,120
My God, if you just look down this way,
it's like a bounty. Look at that.

315
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,480
And the reason that happens is

316
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,080
that if a peach doesn't meet strict
aesthetic standards,

317
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,000
it might not be worth a farmer
even trying to sell it.

318
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,360
Our produce aisles have become a lot
like Leonardo DiCaprio's penis,

319
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,600
exclusively accessible
to the physically flawless.

320
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,200
And it's not right.
That's not right.

321
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,440
In fact, our produce body shaming
is actually so ingrained,

322
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,800
it's reflected in the USDA's
grading standards. Just look

323
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,760
at the visual grading standards
for peaches. This is a no. 1 peach.

324
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,800
And of course it is. That's an
undeniably beautiful peach.

325
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,440
I want to buy that peach dinner
and fuck it.

326
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,840
Whereas, whereas
- and brace yourself -

327
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,120
this is a US number two peach. And that
is an abomination unto the Lord.

328
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,960
And as soon as it is labeled
a number two, it can lose two thirds

329
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,000
of its market value to a farmer,
even though its contents are the same.

330
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,920
And many retailers have standards
even more strict than the USDA's.

331
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,760
All of which is why so many peaches end
up being thrown on the ground to rot.

332
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,320
And that should not be
how we treat our fruit.

333
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,000
It should only be how
we treat our celebrities.

334
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,200
So help me God, Channing Tatum,
you lose one muscle fiber

335
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,240
on that six pack, and I will personally
toss you into Hollywood's landfill.

336
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,400
You keep it tight, Tatum.
Hashtag, keepittighttatum. Do it.

337
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:26,000
And the thing is, we don't just
reject food because of how it looks.

338
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,560
Sometimes, we do it out
of pure fear.

339
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,200
According to one estimate, 91 percent
of us have thrown out food

340
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,400
that's past its sell by date,
because we're afraid it's not safe.

341
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,520
And I am absolutely part of that
91 percent. We're weirdly reverent

342
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,600
towards these dates,
even when they make no sense.

343
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,560
Use by, sell by. And nothing.
But just a date.

344
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,720
- And this is all the same brand.
- This is all the same brand.

345
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,680
This is not only the same brand,
but also the same 2%.

346
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,360
So what does this show us ?

347
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,160
This shows there's complete
confusion out there.

348
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,560
The only labels on food more
meaningless than those

349
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,440
are the ones on Smirnoff bottles
that say "triple distilled vodka."

350
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,680
Oh really, Smirnoff ? So you ran
the potato sweat through the tube sock

351
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,920
two extra times ?
Thanks for spending the effort.

352
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,560
We naturally assume sell by dates
reflect a uniform standard of safety.

353
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,360
But that is not true.
Well, actually it has nothing to do

354
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,320
with safety at all. It's just
a manufacturers best guess of when

355
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,040
that food is gonna be the freshest
and at the best quality.

356
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,440
Exactly, those dates are decided on
by manufacturers.

357
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,840
And if I were a food manufacturer, I'd
make those dates as tight as possible

358
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,360
to convince people to buy
a new one of my products.

359
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,080
Because unlike Apple, I can't just
create a new operating system

360
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,320
that suddenly means your old cereal
is incompatible with your mouth.

361
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,920
The truth is, with the exception of
baby formula, the federal government

362
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,720
does not require any food to carry
an expiration date.

363
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,240
And state laws vary widely,
with nine states not requiring

364
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,000
any date labels at all. Which means,
most of the time, sell by dates

365
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,720
are one of those things
that look official,

366
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,360
but you can probably ignore,
like a child in a cop uniform.

367
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:15,200
Just stop it, Tyler. I'm not under
"awwest !" You're under awwest !

368
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,640
But because we think those dates
are real, many supermarkets

369
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,920
throw expired food out even
before its sell by date.

370
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,040
And they don't donate it for what
they think is a pretty good reason.

371
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,680
Do you have anything that's close
dated or any culls ?

372
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,480
- No, we can't do that.
- You can't ?

373
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,880
No. It's a food and health
and safety issues.

374
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,840
Do you guys donate it then ?
You don't donate.

375
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,720
No.
It goes right in the garbage can.

376
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,000
We do it because we'd get
too many lawsuits.

377
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,280
It's too many lawsuits ?
Have you guys been sued before ?

378
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,600
I don't know, to tell you the truth.
But it's a health and safety issue.

379
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,280
That's a common misconception.
We all think that if you donate food

380
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,640
and someone gets sick,
you could get sued.

381
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,800
I thought that until earlier this week.
But we looked into it

382
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,560
and couldn't find a single case
where a food donor has been sued.

383
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,880
It doesn't happen. It's a false fear,
like believing if you go in the water

384
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,680
after eating you'll get a cramp
and drown. It turns out,

385
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,040
that isn't true, either.
This week has blown my mind !

386
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,040
Because the system is, if you donate
food to a charity,

387
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,640
you're covered by the Emerson Act,
which says you cannot be sued

388
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,080
if you make a food donation
in good faith.

389
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,960
You presumably get the same cover
with donating clothes, even though,

390
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,680
in some cases there
you really should be sued.

391
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,000
Donating a cowl neck sweater ?
Hello ?! The homeless live in shelters,

392
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,240
not fall 2008.

393
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,240
But here's the problem even
if more people understood that,

394
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,240
there would still be food that
doesn't get to people who need it,

395
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,040
for a critical reason.

396
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,520
Harold McClarty of HMC Farms says
he'd like to donate more of his peaches

397
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,800
to the food banks but...

398
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,520
Getting it into the hands of
somebody to eat, it isn't free.

399
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,480
There's got to be an economic
incentive to move more of this

400
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,600
into an avenue that food banks could
take advantage of.

401
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,760
It's a lot easier and cheaper just
to basically throw it away.

402
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,160
And that may be
the biggest issue of all.

403
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,120
For businesses, donating food
is genuinely expensive.

404
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,280
You've got to box it, store it,
coordinate deliveries for it...

405
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,520
There's a lot of overheads.
And you cannot fault companies

406
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,920
for caring about their bottom line,
in the same way you can't fault a dog

407
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,800
for caring about licking its balls.
It's what dogs do. It's natural.

408
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,000
And dog balls are delicious.

409
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,560
Companies, in their defense,
are not charities.

410
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,920
Which is why they should be
incentivized to donate food

411
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,560
with tax breaks. Large corporations
already get one. But annoyingly,

412
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,960
that same break for small businesses
is not a permanent part

413
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,040
of the tax code. Meaning
that Congress has to keep renewing it.

414
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,000
That's a problem because family farms
or local restaurants may not know

415
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,960
if they're going to get that break
at the end of the year

416
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,200
and therefore whether donating food
will be financially viable for them.

417
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,240
It's a ridiculous system,

418
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,560
which probably prevents a lot of food
from being donated.

419
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,480
So here is the good news:

420
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,840
in February this year, a congressman
proposed HR 644,

421
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,800
the Fighting Hunger Incentive Act,
to make that tax break permanent.

422
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,120
Here actually is one
of the bill's sponsors.

423
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,080
It's time to get rid of these short term
fixes, embrace long term solutions.

424
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,240
This legislation simply makes
the provisions permanent.

425
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,680
And when you think about it,
that's important,

426
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,120
because when something's not
permanent, it affects our behavior.

427
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,240
That's why we all treat rental
cars like

428
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,960
we're in a "Fast and Furious" movie.
"Oh I'm sorry, sharp turn ahead ?

429
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,680
Get ready to drift,
Kia Sorrento. Woo !"

430
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,760
Now, now you'll be happy to hear,
that bill passed the House.

431
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,920
However, by the time it did, it had
been bundled together with other,

432
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
unpaid for tax breaks, and retitled
the America Gives More Act.

433
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,800
But still, that original provision
was in there. Which means

434
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,440
this problem has been solved, the show
is over and we can roll credits

435
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,920
and all live happily ever after,
right ?

436
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,840
No, not right.

437
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,520
Because when the bill got
to the Senate, they,

438
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,640
and I honestly did not know
this was even possible,

439
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,400
they removed everything from inside
the bill, retitled it

440
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,200
the Trade Facilitation and Trade
Enforcement Act of 2015,

441
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,240
refilled it with completely different
language concerning border control

442
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,520
and US-Israeli relations.
Which meant yes, HR 644 passed,

443
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,800
just with a completely different title
and completely different contents.

444
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,560
It's like going to a restaurant,
ordering a veggie burger

445
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,520
and having the waiter say "here you
go, we made it out of meatloaf

446
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,800
and we call it a waffle."
And then you can't even say,

447
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,520
"well I don't want this, give it
to someone who needs it,

448
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,000
because they can't, because they
don't know whether or not

449
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:03,040
they'll get a fucking tax credit
for it. And look, the insane thing

450
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,160
is everyone basically agrees,
small businesses should get

451
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,760
tax incentives to donate food. So
we have to find a way to pass that.

452
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,840
But even if we do, it will be
one small part of what needs to be

453
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,680
a much bigger solution,
from resolving to eat uglier fruit,

454
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,080
to taking expiration dates
with a pinch of salt,

455
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,480
to no longer worrying about getting
sued by high powered lawyers

456
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:33,800
representing the hungry. And we all
have to address our relationship

457
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,200
with food waste. Or at the very
least, our cheeseburger commercials

458
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,240
are going to have to get
a lot more honest.

459
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,160
What's more American
than a cheeseburger ?

460
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,600
This cheeseburger, loaded with
a hot dog and potato chips.

461
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,760
In the hands of a model. In a hot tub.
In a pick up truck.

462
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,320
On an aircraft carrier. In front
of the Statue of Liberty.

463
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,280
I'll tell you what's more American.
If that cheeseburger's

464
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,480
then thrown away, along
with 15 other cheeseburgers

465
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,880
in front of a food insecure
family of four

466
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,680
who frankly cannot fucking believe
their eyes. As they stand on top

467
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,120
of 14 tons of perfectly edible if
aesthetically unappealing fruits

468
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,360
and vegetables. Which in turn sits
on top of 80 tons of diary products,

469
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,840
all one day past their arbitrary
sell by date. All of which sits

470
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:23,160
inside a tear, rolling down Abraham
Lincoln's face on Mount Rushmore,

471
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,880
which is now nearly chin deep in
millions of discarded cheeseburgers,

472
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,000
all gradually decomposing and emitting
flammable methane

473
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,000
in red, white and blue.

474
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,600
That is fucking American !

475
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,160
Available in dumpsters behind
Carl's Jr. and Hardee's.
