00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,120
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,360
Season 2
Episode 12

3
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,800
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,080
I'm John Oliver.

5
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,040
Thank you so much
for being with us.

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,000
We just have time
for a quick recap of the week,

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,920
and we begin in Baltimore,
where there have been protests all week

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,920
following the death
of 25-year-old Freddie Gray

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,920
from injuries sustained
in police custody.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,920
It has been a delicate situation,
handled by the media with all the deft,

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,680
not at all racist touch
that they've become known for.

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,160
Please watch as Geraldo Rivera
greets someone as Russell Simmons

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,080
who is absolutely
not Russell Simmons.

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,080
Mr. Simmons ? Russell ?

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,880
The hip-hop mogul.
Why are you here ?

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,400
- I'm Kevin Liles.
- Sorry.

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,480
- You look just like him.
- I don't know.

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,040
So, Kevin, why are you here ?

19
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,040
Okay.
Geraldo, you do realize

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,560
that when African Americans
stand together as one,

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,160
that doesn't mean they're all literally
the same person, right ?

22
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,920
Honestly, I have to say,
you would think a journalist

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,400
like Geraldo Rivera...
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,920
That's my mistake.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,080
Not all people with mustaches
look the same.

26
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,120
You would think a journalist
like Geraldo Rivera...

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,680
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,520
That's Hall of Fame pitcher
Rollie Fingers.

29
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,160
Do we have a photo
of the actual Geraldo Rivera ?

30
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,360
Perfect.
That's the actual one.

31
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,920
That's the real one.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,640
Geraldo Rivera is supposed
to be a journalist.

33
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,800
And I suppose we should
all just be thankful

34
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,000
that none of his colleagues
made exactly the same mistake.

35
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,920
Okay, you bear a striking resemblance
to Russell Simmons.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,520
You tell me you're not him.
You tell me you're Kevin Liles.

37
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,920
I'm not sure I believe you.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,920
We think
this is Russell Simmons, Wolf.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,880
- That's Kevin Liles.
- This is Kevin Liles ?

40
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,400
Why is everyone so insistent

41
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,920
on finding Russell Simmons
in the middle of this crowd ?

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,920
Is there a prize for the first reporter
to find him ?

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,920
Because this guy
would not let it go.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,480
He's one of the chief
organizers of the march.

45
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,480
Wolf, he brought in
NBA star Carmelo Anthony.

46
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,920
He brought in Russell Simmons,
who tried to masquerade

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,560
as a man named Kevin Liles.

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,440
He's not masquerading
as someone else.

49
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,520
That's not Russell Simmons.

50
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,720
This isn't an episode
of Scooby Doo.

51
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,720
You're not going
to pull off his mask

52
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,520
and go, "Look, everyone,
it was Russell Simmons all along !"

53
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,240
This week has shone
a serious light

54
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,920
on the disparities
in Baltimore

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,680
between the community
and the police force,

56
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,280
disparities
that were highlighted

57
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,120
when six officers were arrested
on charges in Gray's death,

58
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,600
and were then
released on bail.

59
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,920
All of the officers
have posted bond.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,960
The amounts range
from $250,000 to $350,000.

61
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,360
That sounds like a fair amount
for such serious charges.

62
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,760
But juxtapose that
with the bail set

63
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,600
for the people involved
in the protests,

64
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,080
like this 18-year-old
who helped smash the window

65
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,920
of several cars,
including one police car.

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,920
How much was his bail ?

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,400
The charges he's facing
are all misdemeanors,

68
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,240
yet his bail was set
at $500,000.

69
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,920
$500,000
for breaking car windows.

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,360
To put that in context,

71
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,640
even Robert Durst had his bail
set at just $300,000

72
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,640
after definitely not killing
that guy in Galveston, Texas.

73
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,400
That amount of money
makes absolutely no sense.

74
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,200
That kid's crimes were misdemeanors,
he turned himself in.

75
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,280
In fact, the only explanation
for his bail being set that high

76
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,560
would be that just like
Geraldo Rivera and that guy from CNN,

77
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,640
judges in Baltimore
can't look at black people

78
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,240
without seeing
millionaire Russell Simmons.

79
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,000
So let's move on
to Venezuela,

80
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,000
a country
you think about so little,

81
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,280
you didn't even realize
that's not Venezuela,

82
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,200
this is Venezuela.

83
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,080
Actually,
that's not Venezuela either.

84
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,600
This is Venezuela.

85
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,000
Except it isn't.

86
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,800
Because Venezuela
was the first one all along.

87
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,920
But the fact you didn't notice
is the point.

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Venezuela's leader,
Nicolás Maduro,

89
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,920
has been going through
a multitude of problems domestically

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,720
from food shortages
to electricity rationing

91
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,440
to massive inflation,
and it all came to a head last week.

92
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,480
In Venezuela,
a 54-year-old woman

93
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,880
threw a mango at President
Nicolás Maduro's head.

94
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,480
You can see
the 54-year-old woman tossing a mango

95
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,880
to Venezuelan president
Nicolás Maduro,

96
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,920
hitting him right in the head.

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,920
The mango had a message
written on it.

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,560
"If you can, call me,"
the message said.

99
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:45,320
Well, this sounds like the premise
of an adorable romantic comedy.

100
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,920
I'd love to see
Paul Rudd as the president,

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,760
Sofía Vergara as the woman,

102
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,560
and Paul Giamatti as the mango.

103
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,920
It turns out...

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,400
It turns out...
It's good casting.

105
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,240
It turns out the woman
desperately wanted an apartment.

106
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,360
And the amazing thing is,
it worked.

107
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,760
Maduro says his government
will give Olivo

108
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,920
what she asked for an apartment.

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,400
"You will get an apartment,

110
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,880
and it will be given to you
in the next few hours."

111
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,400
That is a fast
government response,

112
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,880
and a pretty
dangerous precedent

113
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
for the president
of Venezuela to send.

114
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Because now everyone knows,

115
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,160
if you want something,
write it on a mango

116
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,520
and throw it
at his fucking head.

117
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,920
And unsurprisingly, that's exactly
what's happened since.

118
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,560
I received another mango,

119
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,040
a ripe mango.

120
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,480
Here it is. They wrote down
the phone number.

121
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,880
They gave me a mango today,
just now.

122
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,120
Mangoes are in.
It's the time of the mango.

123
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,920
You see ? I have it here.

124
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,880
Mangoes are welcomed,
lovingly,

125
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,800
but handed over gently.

126
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,080
Don't throw them.
Hand them over to me.

127
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,360
This is fantastic.

128
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,960
The president of a country

129
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,640
basically begging people
to stop throwing mangoes at his head.

130
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,560
And to the people of Venezuela,
I say this:

131
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,160
Keep doing it.
Send him your mango demands,

132
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,040
or "demandgos,"
as I call them.

133
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,240
In fact, we should
all be using fruit

134
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,320
to improve
government efficiency as well.

135
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,920
Next time you need
an expedited passport renewal,

136
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,720
wouldn't it be nice
to be able to say,

137
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
"Three weeks
is a little long for me.

138
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,880
"Let's see if you
can speed it up a bit.

139
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,600
"Yeah, this is a honeydew.
That's how angry I am.

140
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,640
"I've written to you
on a garbage melon

141
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,800
"that only exists to fill out
suspiciously cheap Edible Arrangements.

142
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,720
Let's do this thing !"

143
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,400
Finally tonight,

144
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,880
Bud Light.

145
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,280
If Budweiser
is the King of Beers,

146
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,200
then Bud Light
is the feudal peasant

147
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,720
covered in donkey shit of beers.

148
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,600
And this week, Bud Light
found itself in trouble.

149
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,920
Hard to understand how this
made it past the pitch meeting.

150
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,760
A slogan on bottles
of Bud Light

151
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,240
called it "The perfect beer

152
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,240
for removing 'no'
from your vocabulary for the night."

153
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,880
Well, well,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

154
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,880
Well, clearly, I did not
just drink a Bud Light

155
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,080
because, "No, Bud Light !
No ! No !"

156
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,880
It is pretty obvious

157
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,880
why this slogan
was problematic.

158
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,080
Some say the message recalls
alcohol's connection to sexual assault.

159
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,080
Critics saying it invites
attacks on women.

160
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,520
I'd say it has
a certain rapey feel to it.

161
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,320
Okay. That's true.

162
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,880
But it would be great
if you used a slightly

163
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,880
more serious word than "rapey,"
because it's somewhat diminishing.

164
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,080
It's like saying Floyd Mayweather
is a smidge "assaulty."

165
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,960
It's technically correct,

166
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,760
but it would be
more appropriate to say

167
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,560
he's a woman-battering
human landfill.

168
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,560
That would be
more on the money.

169
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,720
He's a good boxer.
He boxes as well, apparently.

170
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,560
The amazing thing was,

171
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,000
this was not
just one person's mistake.

172
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,520
The label went through at least
five layers of approval

173
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,240
before it landed
on the bottle.

174
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,880
Allow me
to venture a wild guess

175
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,880
as to what those five layers
of approval

176
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,600
at Budweiser's
corporate headquarters were.

177
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,720
Layer on... "Yeah, boy !"

178
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,720
Layer two... "Sick idea, brah !"

179
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,360
Layer three... "That's what
I'm talkin' about ! A'ight !"

180
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,560
Layer four... "Nah, that's what
I'm talkin' about, son !"

181
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,400
And of course, step five...
"Blahhhhhh !

182
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,120
Blahhh ! Approved !
Blahhhh !"

183
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,920
It's the Bud Light way.

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,880
The slogan has since
been withdrawn,

185
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,920
but Bud Light's broader
"Up For Whatever" campaign remains.

186
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,320
You've probably seen
the hidden-camera-based commercials.

187
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,280
- What's up, guys ? What's your name ?
- Riley.

188
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,960
So if I gave you a Bud Light,
are you up for whatever happens next ?

189
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,160
Yeah.

190
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,320
Good. Great news. Fantastic. I've got
two more questions for you then.

191
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,920
What's your blood type, and how
would you like to meet Keith Richards ?

192
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,040
In these ads,
whenever someone accepts,

193
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,320
they're taken
on a spontaneous adventure

194
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,200
which might involve playing table
tennis with Arnold Schwarzenegger

195
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,880
or a real-life game of Pac-Man,
which sure, looks like fun,

196
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,600
especially if
you're a 10-year-old in 1985.

197
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,240
But if Bud Light really wants
to fix the mistakes in its marketing,

198
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,280
then in the interest
of accuracy,

199
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,720
they need
to fix those ads too.

200
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,240
- What's up, guys ?
- Hey.

201
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,880
If I gave you this Bud Light, are
you up for whatever happens next ?

202
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,640
Yeah, sure.

203
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,880
Wait, do I have to drink
the Bud Light ?

204
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,200
- Yeah.
- Then no.

205
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,440
What ? Why ?

206
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,160
Because Bud Light tastes like a beer
that someone already threw up.

207
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,120
Yeah, it's like a liquid
John Mayer song.

208
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,560
The thing is, it's all about whatever
happens next. So if you could...

209
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,960
But it tastes like the flat soda that
a homeless guy uses to rinse off birds.

210
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,400
Yeah, that's exactly
what it tastes like.

211
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,920
Okay, look,
I'm not supposed to do this,

212
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,360
but we have hidden cameras inside
this bar. And when you get outside...

213
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,440
That's illegal.

214
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,880
... there's gonna be
this huge thing for you.

215
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,720
If you could just
drink this Bud Light.

216
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,520
You mean the beer that tastes
like water strained

217
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,040
from a gutter
full of dog's teeth ?

218
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,480
Bud Light tastes like
the scared urine of a rabbit.

219
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,040
It's like Steven Seagal's
pre-cum.

220
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,160
Yeah, but we have, like,
an epic night planned for you.

221
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,040
Listen to me very carefully,
'cause this is important.

222
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,880
If a nickel could urinate,
it would taste like Bud Light.

223
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,320
That's exactly right.

224
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Bud Light tastes
like the ghost of a dead lemon.

225
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,320
Basically, if water
could just go bad.

226
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,880
We have a stretch limo
waiting for you guys outside

227
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,880
with Peyton Manning in it,
and he's going to take you

228
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,280
to play a game
of giant Jenga, okay ?

229
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,880
And then after that,
you're going to go

230
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,760
on one of those
Virgin Galactic missions into space.

231
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,840
That sounds amazing.
I'm just not gonna do it.

232
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,920
All right, you know what ?
Just let me drink it.

233
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,960
What does that taste like ?
Describe it.

234
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,560
It tastes like
if a raccoon ejaculated

235
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,200
carbonated vinegar
inside of an old log.

236
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,720
Yes.
That is a good one.

237
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,440
Bud Light,

238
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,280
the only beer that makes you up
for literally anything else.

239
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,120
Our main story tonight

240
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,440
is standardized tests,

241
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,880
the fastest way
to terrify any child with five letters,

242
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,480
outside of just whispering
the word "clown."

243
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,600
It's currently testing season
all over the country.

244
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,600
And with that comes
the usual flood

245
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,880
of anxiety
and school-produced videos

246
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,080
designed to get kids
in the mood.

247
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,880
Can't read my

248
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,480
no you can't read my

249
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,000
TEST TAKER FACE !

250
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
Let's show them we can do it !

251
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,400
Hey we can do it !
An this is crazy

252
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,400
But I'm determined
So Test Me Maybe ?

253
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,120
WHAT DOES THE TEST SAY ?

254
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,880
Get your number two pencils out !

255
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,480
Your number two pencils out !

256
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,880
Get your number two pencils out !

257
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,440
What the test say ?

258
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,000
Get your number two pencils out !

259
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,800
Get your number two pencils out !

260
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,480
Look, standardized tests
look like amazing fun.

261
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,080
I wish I could take one
right now.

262
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,880
Bring me a pencil !
A number two, please !

263
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,240
But it gets better, because
one elementary school in Texas

264
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,320
even held a test-themed
pep rally

265
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,280
featuring a monkey mascot.

266
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,480
Ooh ah ah !
Time to get funky !

267
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,600
Ooh ah ah,
'cause here comes the monkey

268
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,880
Ooh ah ah,
time to get funky

269
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,040
Ooh-ee, monkey,
funky monkey.

270
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,600
Look, let's all agree

271
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,200
there is no scenario
in which the words

272
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,080
"Here comes the monkey"
can fail to pump you up.

273
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,880
Just imagine right now
I was your surgeon

274
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,080
and I said to you,
"I'm about to put you under.

275
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,440
"There's about a 20% chance
of survival.

276
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,880
"And I have four
important words for you.

277
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,880
Here comes the monkey."

278
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,800
Ooh ah ah !
Time to get funky !

279
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,320
Ooh ah ah, 'cause here
comes the monkey...

280
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,440
You're going to be looking forward
to that operation.

281
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,440
It's going to be
a fun time.

282
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,040
You see ?
You love it !

283
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,920
The point is...

284
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,400
The point is
you've proved my point.

285
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,880
The point is,

286
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,320
the videos
and monkey mascots

287
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,880
would have you think
that testing is amazing,

288
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,520
which is why this spate
of recent news stories

289
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,120
has been so surprising.

290
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
In the Lower Hudson Valley,
many districts reported

291
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,880
that more than 25%
of their students opted out.

292
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,880
More than 1,700 elementary, middle,
and high-school students

293
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,880
opted out of taking
the PARCC tests.

294
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,120
There was five kids
that I was with.

295
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,680
- That took the test ?
- Yeah.

296
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,280
Like, almost
the entire auditorium

297
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,240
was filled with kids
that didn't take it.

298
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,440
Not a single junior showed up

299
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,800
to take the Common Core
Smarter Balance test this week.

300
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,920
Wow.

301
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,880
The entire class
boycotted the test.

302
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,560
The only other thing
an entire class of juniors

303
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,360
has ever managed
to agree on

304
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,160
is that The Scarlet Letter
could be told much simpler with emojis.

305
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,880
"Yeah, we get it.

306
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,040
"We get it.
red lady, finger-finger,

307
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,040
"devil, baby.
We've all read the book.

308
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,560
It's a good story."

309
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,440
But, look,
is it any wonder

310
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,640
that American students
are sick of tests ?

311
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,080
Between benchmarks,
diagnostics, pre-and mock tests,

312
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,840
they take a lot of them.

313
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,880
Students are taking
between 10 and 20 standardized tests,

314
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,880
depending on the grade.
A total average

315
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,480
of 113 different ones
by graduation.

316
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,960
113 is a lot of tests.

317
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,880
It's approaching the amount
that you'd ask your doctor for

318
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,080
the morning after you woke up from
a one night stand with Colin Farrell.

319
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,880
"Just give me
all of them twice."

320
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,080
And this amount of testing
can take a toll.

321
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,640
Teachers have reported
kids throwing up,

322
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,760
kids crying,
especially the younger ones.

323
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,480
And it's the pressure.

324
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,280
That's true.
In fact, this happens so much

325
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,880
that official instructions
for test administrators

326
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,720
specify what to do if a student
vomits on his or her test booklet.

327
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,800
And something is wrong
with our system

328
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,640
when we just assume
a certain number of kids will vomit.

329
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,760
Tests are supposed to be
assessments of skills,

330
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,440
not a rap battle
on 8 Mile Road.

331
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,040
"Oh, Eminem, why did your mom
make you spaghetti ?

332
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,120
She knew tonight
was rap-battle night."

333
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,880
So how did we get here ?

334
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,040
Well, the explosion of testing
can be traced back to the '90s,

335
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,320
when you probably remember
stories like these

336
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,160
about the state
of public education.

337
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,240
When 40 nations recently took

338
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,600
the International
Math and Science Test,

339
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,680
American students
scored near the bottom.

340
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,520
That must have hurt,

341
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,800
especially because you knew
the French children

342
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,240
weren't even trying.

343
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,040
"Go on, play with
your silly numbers.

344
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,560
"They tell you nothing
of the true nature of the soul.

345
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,240
I weep for you."

346
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,360
In response to statistics
like that...

347
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,960
In response to those kind
of statistics,

348
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,360
President George W. Bush,
on just his third day in office,

349
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,120
announced his No Child
Left Behind program.

350
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,760
It passed Congress
with bipartisan support,

351
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,960
because of course it did.

352
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,880
Voting against
No Child Left Behind

353
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,880
is like voting against
No Puppy Left Unsnuggled.

354
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,040
What monster would do that ?

355
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,880
His name is Patches
and he needs love !

356
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,120
The program was designed
to be data-driven

357
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,880
and involved testing children
every single year

358
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,880
in order to identify and fix
failing schools.

359
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,480
An accountability system
must have a consequence.

360
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,760
Otherwise it's not much
of an accountability system.

361
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,880
It's hard to argue
with any of that.

362
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,680
Unfortunately, accountability
is one of those concepts

363
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,680
that everybody's in favor of,

364
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,680
but nobody knows
how to make work,

365
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,520
like synergy or maxi dresses.

366
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,760
No matter who wear them, they look like
a poncho fucked a waterfall.

367
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,560
You look like the ghost
of Gwyneth Paltrow future.

368
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,880
"I only haunt brunch.
Goop !"

369
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,880
No Child Left Behind
increased the number

370
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,880
of federally-mandated tests
from six to 17.

371
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,800
And the fixation
on testing

372
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,800
was something which
our current president

373
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,880
seemed to be against
as he ran for office.

374
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,920
Don't tell us
that the only way to teach a child

375
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,920
is to spend
too much of a year

376
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,320
preparing him to fill out
a few bubbles

377
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,720
in a standardized test !
We know that's not true !

378
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,880
Wow, that man knew
how to pander to teachers.

379
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,760
"You know what else ? There should be
pool tables in the teachers' lounge !

380
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,440
"And every year,
you should be able to slap one parent !

381
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,080
"Vote for me !
I'm outta here. I'm outta here.

382
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,560
Vote for me."

383
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,200
But once this president
took office,

384
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,840
he didn't get rid of tests.

385
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,880
Instead he added
his own education initiatives,

386
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,520
like Race to the Top,
which encouraged states

387
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,920
to adopt the Common Core,
which featured a logo

388
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
of snails 69'ing.

389
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,000
And again,
the intentions here were good.

390
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,000
Because we do have
underperforming schools.

391
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,400
And there are major economic
and racial disparities

392
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,400
in the quality of education
children receive.

393
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,080
And anything that can help us
narrow those gaps

394
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,880
is obviously a good thing.

395
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,960
The problem
has been the implementation.

396
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,320
For instance, many states
now tie teacher pay

397
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,160
to performance
using one particular approach.

398
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,720
It's called
"value-added analysis,"

399
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,000
rating teachers based
on student test scores.

400
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,720
For instance, if a student who ranked
in the 60th percentile

401
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,720
tests higher
at the end of the year,

402
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,720
the teacher
gets a better rating.

403
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,720
If the student falls,
the teacher's rating falls.

404
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,080
Okay, well, that explains why
many teachers' classroom decorations

405
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,080
that used to read
"Believe in yourself"

406
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,120
now say
"Don't fuck me on this !

407
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,720
Don't fuck me !"

408
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,240
And while the idea
of tying teacher pay

409
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,280
to student improvement
sounds great in theory,

410
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,880
here's how it can work
in practice.

411
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,480
I have four students
whose predicted scores

412
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,160
were literally impossible.

413
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,880
One of my sixth-grade students

414
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,880
had a predicted score
of 286.34.

415
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,720
However, the highest
a sixth-grade student can earn is 283.

416
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,880
The student did earn
a 283, incidentally.

417
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,880
Despite the fact
she earned a perfect score,

418
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,640
she counted negatively
towards my evaluation

419
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,880
because she was three points
below her predicted score.

420
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,000
That is ridiculous.

421
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,560
The only way she could have hit
her predicted score

422
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,320
was if she answered
everything right,

423
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,680
wrote a few extra questions
of her own,

424
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,880
got those right,
and then stapled them to the test.

425
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,880
That teacher lives in Florida,

426
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,880
which uses this formula
to assess teachers,

427
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,880
a formula which looks like
the kind of thing

428
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,880
that aliens carve
into an anti-Semite cornfield.

429
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,520
And many of these formulas

430
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,680
on which
teachers' careers depend

431
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,080
were partly
inspired by research, and this is true,

432
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,680
that modeled
the reproductive trends of livestock.

433
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,960
Basically, we judge
the nuance of what happens

434
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,760
in the complicated world
of a child's mind

435
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,880
the same way
that we judge this.

436
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
"Look, I don't know
what we did wrong,

437
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,760
"but your child is going
to either pass algebra

438
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,360
"or birth a healthy calf.
I don't know.

439
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,880
Flip a coin."

440
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,880
With the stakes this high,
the tests had better be good.

441
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,920
But there is ample reason
to suspect

442
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,720
that that is not the case.

443
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,120
Just look at the Florida
Comprehensive Assessment Test, or FCAT.

444
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,400
A Florida school board member
was concerned

445
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,720
and a little suspicious
when he learned

446
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,480
that only 39%
of his state's 10th graders

447
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,880
had performed at or above
grade level in reading.

448
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,480
So he had an idea.

449
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,280
I asked the district
at that point

450
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,880
to give me the closest thing
they could legally

451
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,120
to the FCAT reading
and math test, and I took it.

452
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,160
That test labeled me
as a poor reader,

453
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,040
and I have a couple
of master's degrees

454
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,440
and I've been reelected
four times,

455
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,680
and I teach
39 graduate courses

456
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,880
at six universities
in this country.

457
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,840
Okay, okay, okay.

458
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,640
We get it.
The test sucks.

459
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Anything else
you want to brag about there ?

460
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,120
"Oh, I also know how to play
'Mary Had A Little Lamb'

461
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,800
"on the recorder, and guess who
can do 60 non-consecutive push-ups ?

462
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,800
This fucking guy."

463
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,520
But, look, he does have a point.
He does have a point.

464
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,920
If a test
fails to reflect ability,

465
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,920
there are human consequences.

466
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,560
Because one shy Florida eighth grader
who had a near-perfect score

467
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,560
in her advanced
language-arts class

468
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,560
was asked
to leave it last year

469
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,360
due to her inexplicably
low scores on the FCAT.

470
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,880
And last fall,
she told a school board meeting

471
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,840
exactly how that felt.

472
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,880
Every year,
I do good in school.

473
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,880
But I get low test...

474
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,760
But I get low test scores
on the FCAT

475
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,880
and it feels like
a punch in the stomach.

476
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,880
This is unfair,
and I don't want to lose my opportunity

477
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,160
to take
my advanced-lit classes

478
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,480
or get a better education
because of one test.

479
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,480
That is just awful.

480
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,600
I take back
everything I said

481
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,800
about wanting to take
a standardized test.

482
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,600
In fact, you know what ?
Bring out the monkey.

483
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,880
Bring the monkey...
No, no, no !

484
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,880
No, turn off his music !

485
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,400
Turn it...
do not applaud him !

486
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,040
What the fuck
is wrong with you ?

487
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,880
What is wrong with you ?
You made that little girl cry !

488
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,560
Think about what you've done.

489
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,880
Go... no, no, no !
Don't you dance it off.

490
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,440
You go and think
about what you've done.

491
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,880
Shame on you.

492
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,880
Shame on you !

493
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,720
Look, at this point,

494
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,880
you have to ask yourself,

495
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,320
if standardized tests
are bad for teachers and bad for kids,

496
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,320
who exactly
are they good for ?

497
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,920
Well, it turns out

498
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,240
they're operated by companies
like all these.

499
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,920
And let's just focus
on the largest one, Pearson.

500
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,080
As of 2012, they had nearly 40%
of the testing market,

501
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,080
almost triple
their nearest competitor.

502
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,880
And if you've never heard of them,
then congratulations.

503
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,400
But just mention their name
to any parent or teacher

504
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,120
in a state they operate in
and you see what happens.

505
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,880
Because Pearson
are the educational equivalent

506
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,560
of Time Warner Cable.

507
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,360
Either you've never had an interaction
with them and don't care,

508
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,880
or they have ruined
your fucking life.

509
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,360
Pearson have
a shocking amount of influence

510
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,000
over America's schools.
So much so, that at this point,

511
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,000
a hypothetical girl
could take Pearson tests

512
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,440
from kindergarten
through at least eighth grade,

513
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,840
tests, by the way,
that she studied for

514
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,400
using Pearson curriculum
and textbooks,

515
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,560
taught to her by teachers
who were certified

516
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,120
by their own Pearson test.

517
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,280
If at some point, she was tested for
a learning disability

518
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,880
like ADHD,
that's also a Pearson test.

519
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,080
And if she eventually
got sick of Pearson and dropped out,

520
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,480
well, she'd have to take
the GED,

521
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,720
which is now, guess what ?
Also a Pearson test.

522
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,200
In fact, the only test
they have no hand in

523
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,720
is the HPV test
you might take in college,

524
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,840
and I can only assume
that they'll get on that

525
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,040
as soon as they see
this fucking show.

526
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,680
Pearson has enjoyed
spectacular growth and profit,

527
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,520
and yet their track record
is littered with complaints

528
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,520
concerning technical glitches,
slow grading,

529
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,880
and even the contents
of their tests.

530
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,200
Take what happened in New York
just a few years ago.

531
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,200
Almost 30 different
test questions

532
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,560
have now been declared invalid
because they're confusing

533
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,000
or have outright errors.

534
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,800
They had already pulled
six questions from an English exam

535
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,920
related to a bizarre passage
about a talking pineapple.

536
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,080
A talking pineapple ?

537
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,000
Well, at the risk of sounding
like a DreamWorks executive

538
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,800
talking to a CGI animator,

539
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,840
tell me more
about this talking pineapple.

540
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,440
Students had
to answer questions about the story,

541
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,160
which they say
goes like this.

542
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,560
"A pineapple challenges
a hare to a race.

543
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,360
Other animals figure the fruit
has a trick up its sleeve,

544
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,160
but the hare wins
and the animals eat the pineapple."

545
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,800
It ends with the moral,
pineapples don't have sleeves.

546
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,320
I was really confused

547
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,080
because I expected
a lot more from them.

548
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,120
That article
about the pineapple and the hare

549
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,840
was stupid and absurd.

550
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,880
Yeah, she's not wrong
about that.

551
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,880
Because we looked up
that test section

552
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,960
and we couldn't work out
all the answers.

553
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,280
That pineapple item doesn't
remotely work as a test question.

554
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,840
It barely works
as a Doors lyric.

555
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:26,880
But it's not just
Pearson's questions that are a problem.

556
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,720
It's how they
check the answers.

557
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,880
The company posted this ad
to Craigslist.

558
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,280
It's to find people
to grade the exams.

559
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,880
Craigslist.

560
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,320
They look for scorers
on Craigslist.

561
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,160
Pearson chooses test graders

562
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,200
the same way that you'd look
for a mattress full of bedbugs

563
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,200
or a no-strings-attached
hand job.

564
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,480
And to be clear here,
just to be clear,

565
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,880
this is not
just a Pearson problem.

566
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,720
Across the whole
testing industry,

567
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,280
you can find former graders

568
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,080
who will tell you
horror stories.

569
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,040
We looked at an essay
every two minutes,

570
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,320
a short answer
every five seconds.

571
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,720
every 10 seconds.

572
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,600
We don't understand
your kids.

573
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,280
We don't understand
anyone's kids.

574
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,960
That is not
an acceptable answer

575
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,200
from a person who may be responsible
for the future of your child.

576
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,040
It's barely acceptable from the
manufacturers of American Girl dolls.

577
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,240
"Oh, we make dolls
for 100 bucks

578
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,360
"that kids can't play with
in case they get them dirty.

579
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,840
"We don't understand
your kids.

580
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,360
We don't understand
anyone's kids."

581
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,920
And as another scorer
points out,

582
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
sometimes grades are given out
not based on merit,

583
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,440
but on quota.

584
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,600
I was told when
I was beginning a project

585
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,800
that, "last year, you know,
there were a certain amount of twos,

586
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,680
"a certain amount of threes,
a certain amount of fours.

587
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,240
"We expect that
to be similar this year."

588
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,520
If that's not similar,
they will tell you,

589
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,920
"We're scoring
too many threes.

590
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,840
We're scoring
too many fours."

591
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,080
And they'll say, "You have to learn
to see more papers as a three.

592
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,440
You have to learn to see
more papers as a four."

593
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,320
But that makes no sense

594
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,880
if the content of what
you're looking at has not changed.

595
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,560
That's like telling
a baseball umpire,

596
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,320
"Hey, we've got a problem
with batting averages.

597
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,560
"You need to see
more home runs as strike-outs,

598
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,440
and more strike-outs
as doubles. Do it now."

599
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,160
And I would love to show you
more questions from these tests,

600
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,520
but unfortunately,
that's not only difficult,

601
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,880
it's often illegal.

602
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,720
Because both states
and companies

603
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,880
have fought to keep
test questions secret

604
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,560
by having teachers
and students

605
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,880
sign statements like,
"I will not use or discuss

606
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,320
the content
of secure test materials."

607
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,120
And while they'll say that this is
to protect against cheating,

608
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,520
it does seem odd that even if you see
something wrong on a test,

609
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,040
you can't tell anyone.

610
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,760
Standardized tests
basically enforce the rule

611
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,240
that all subway riders
instinctively obey.

612
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,080
"If you see something,
keep it the fuck to yourself.

613
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,920
"We've all seen someone
vomit in a purse before.

614
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,840
"Leave it !
Focus ahead and leave it.

615
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,440
Bury it !"

616
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,120
Look, we've had more than a decade
of standardized testing now,

617
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,240
and maybe it's time
to put the test to the test.

618
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,680
The original goal was to narrow
the achievement gap

619
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,200
and boost our scores relative
to the rest of the world.

620
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,880
Well, a 2013 study
found no support for the idea

621
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,920
that No Child Left Behind
narrowed the achievement gap.

622
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,120
And our scores
on the international tests

623
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,160
have not only failed to rise,
they're slightly down.

624
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,000
And I do not want to hear

625
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,320
what that French kid
thinks of those results.

626
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,640
"Oh, all this time
and all this money,

627
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,640
"and your rise
to the top has been, how you say ?

628
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,480
"A meandering jog
on a treadmill.

629
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,360
Buf."

630
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,640
All of this, all of this calls

631
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,760
for a little of what
both presidents asked for

632
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,560
when selling their reforms.

633
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,600
Higher standards
are the right goal.

634
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,160
Accountability
is the right goal.

635
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,000
An accountability system
must have a consequence.

636
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,880
Otherwise it's not much
of an accountability system.

637
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,800
Right.
So let's look at that.

638
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,280
Because as far
as I can see

639
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,880
this is a system which
has enriched multiple companies

640
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,880
and that pays
and fires teachers

641
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,480
with a cattle-birthing formula,

642
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,160
confuses children
with talking pineapples,

643
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,880
and has the same kind of rules
regarding transparency

644
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,360
that Brad Pitt had
for Fight Club.

645
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,640
So for Pearson,
the other companies,

646
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,880
and all the lawmakers
who have supported this system,

647
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,720
the true test is going to be
either convincing everyone it works,

648
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,960
or accepting it doesn't work
and fixing it.

649
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,000
Because at the risk of sounding like
a standardized-test scorer,

650
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,240
your numbers are not good.

651
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,040
And if it seems unfair
to have your fate riding

652
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,560
on a complicated metric
that fails to take

653
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,280
institutional
factors into account

654
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,320
and might not even
tell the whole story,

655
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,160
well, you're not wrong
about that,

656
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,160
but you do not get
to complain about it.

657
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,360
And if all this pressure
to increase your numbers

658
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,080
is making you feel nauseous,
like you might vomit at any second,

659
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,240
then don't worry.
I've got four words for you

660
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,920
that'll make you feel better.
Here comes the monkey !

661
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,880
That's our show.

662
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,920
Thank you so much
for watching !

663
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,960
We'll see you next week.

664
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,680
Bud Light tastes like butter
churned by Boko Haram.

665
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,680
It's like someone drank
a good Mexican beer

666
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,960
and then pissed
in this bottle.

667
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,400
It's like a cloud rained
the tears of a sick child.

668
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,400
It's like making a tea

669
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,200
out of dipping
Scott Caan's balls in water.

670
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,880
Bud Light tastes like
all the used bronzer

671
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,440
in Wildwood, New Jersey.

672
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,600
It tastes like
Robert Durst's aquarium.

673
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,880
It's like antifreeze
that's been filtered

674
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,720
through a used yoga mat.

675
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,640
It tastes like ISIS
attacked your taste buds.

676
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,480
You know the disappointment
that your parents feel

677
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,880
for you still working
in this job ?

678
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,360
- Right.
- That's what Bud Light tastes like.

679
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,800
So...

680
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,920
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

681
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,440
Season 2
End of episode 12
