00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,040
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,560
Season II, episode 6

3
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,040
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,080
Thank you for being with us.
A quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,000
And we begin with ISIS.
The Ebola of people.

6
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,800
They've had themselves a bit
of an up-and-down week

7
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,240
because on one hand, they were
driven out of Tikrit in Iraq,

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,040
but on the other hand,
they gained a new ally.

9
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,120
ISIS is expanding
to new territory in West Africa.

10
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,000
The group accepted an allegiance
from Nigeria based Boko Haram.

11
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,840
Yes, Boko Haram has apparently
pledged allegiance to ISIS.

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,160
You can't deny they do go together
like peanut butter and jelly.

13
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,760
Or more specifically, like diarrhea
and spoiled monkfish.

14
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,240
The merger was discussed
in terms that you would associate

15
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,840
with a more
traditional type of acquisition.

16
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,720
Boko Haram's Twitter account
featuring a slick new look.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,880
With the brand that they get
with the Islamic State,

18
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,080
they can get more recruits,
more money and more media attention.

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,160
What ISIS gets out of this
is a major advance for their brand.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,920
What ?
A major advance for their brand ?

21
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,880
You're talking about
two terror organizations,

22
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,840
not a merger between Stragglr
and The Daily Bounce.

23
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,760
I made up the names of two startups,
but you get the point.

24
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,960
But the fight against ISIS also got
an unexpected recruit,

25
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,080
because there was a benefit concert
in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq

26
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,560
featuring the last person
you'd expect.

27
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:17,160
I'm kind honored that this country
has basically paid attention to Nelly.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Nelly performed a concert in Erbil.
And I am glad he did.

29
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,120
If Nelly was in an Islamic country,
how would he be able to sing:

30
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,440
"it's getting hot in here,
so take off all your clothes,"

31
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,600
"I am getting so hot,
I'm gonna take my clothes off" ?

32
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,800
Then you now have an answer.

33
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,680
Those edits really change meaning
of that song because now

34
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,800
it's a man complaining about the heat
and proposing no solution.

35
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,520
That's not sexy. Moving on now
to Ireland, Europe's Boston.

36
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,200
Home of more red hair than
Debra Messing's shower drain.

37
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Ireland had an interesting 24 hours,
following a bizarre court ruling.

38
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,840
The possession of a range
of psychoactive drugs

39
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,160
has been made legal temporarily
following a ruling by the appeal court.

40
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,320
The possession of drugs including
ecstasy, magic mushrooms

41
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,840
and so-called head shop drugs
is currently legal.

42
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,880
Multiple drugs were accidentally
legalized in Ireland for a day.

43
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,640
If you were waiting for ecstasy
to become legal before trying it,

44
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,800
you are not the type
who's going to really take to ecstasy.

45
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,280
You might want to stick with taking
Nyquil and spinning around.

46
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,960
It's basically the same.

47
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,280
But the best detail was the underlying
case that prompted the ruling

48
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,920
and I'll let an Irish newscaster
fill you in.

49
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,480
A case was brought here before
the court of appeal this morning

50
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,040
by a man prosecuted for possession
of the illegal high meow-meow.

51
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,840
Yes,
there is a drug called "Meow Meow".

52
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,640
Side effects include aloofness and
a heightened interest in string.

53
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,960
You gotta try meow meow, bro.
The laser shows are incredible.

54
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,040
Finally this week we turn to Brazil.

55
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,560
Where even the Amazon rainforest
looks like it's gotten a wax.

56
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,840
President Dilma Rousseff is dealing
with a corruption scandal

57
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,920
which threatens to undermine
her entire government.

58
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,080
Brazil's supreme court approved
an investigation

59
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,520
into some of the top politicians,
they're accused of taking bribes

60
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,120
in exchange for lucrative oil contracts
from the state oil company, Petrobras.

61
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,600
This isn't your standard five grand
in an envelope left under a bench.

62
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,720
Brazil's largest construction
and engineering firms

63
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,800
allegedly paid $800 million in bribes
and other funds to secure contracts.

64
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,960
$800 million ! You'd need
an amazing construction firm

65
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,640
just to build a bench large enough
to hide that bribe.

66
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,720
30 members of Rousseff's ruling
coalition are under investigation,

67
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,160
so she took to the airwaves
to calm people down.

68
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,880
You have every right
to get irritated and be worried,

69
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,400
but I ask for patience,
this situation is transitory.

70
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,200
How is it transitory ? Unless
you're about to flash the country

71
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,520
with one of those memory-erasing
sticks from Men in Black,

72
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,480
I don't think people
are going to forget about this.

73
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Brazilian's weren't listening to
her speech. For a loud reason.

74
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,720
Her critics organized a kind
of pot-banging protest.

75
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,880
I was in Sao Paulo,
it sounded like a football game.

76
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,600
People were banging their pots,
honking their horns.

77
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,520
That's a real form of protest
called Panelaco,

78
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,320
in South America for years
and off Broadway for decades.

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,760
It's so entrenched, it's taken place
on the floor of Brazil's legislature.

80
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,400
I love everything about that
but the best detail there

81
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,400
is the sign language interpreter.

82
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,320
Even he is banging
invisible pots in disgust !

83
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,880
If you think that Brazilians
are overreacting,

84
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,400
you should know this about Rousseff's
involvement in this scandal.

85
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,600
President Rousseff chaired the
board for Petrobras for seven years

86
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,560
when the corruption
is believed to have taken place.

87
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,320
She's been cleared
of involvement in the scheme.

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,440
How ? She chaired the board
of Petrobras while the bribes were...

89
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,560
There's only one way
to handle this.

90
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,920
And now this.

91
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,240
Newscasters
who don't know about you.

92
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,400
I don't know about you guys

93
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,720
but I've heard you're not
supposed to fight fire with fire.

94
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,600
I don't know about you
but I need a good kisser.

95
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,640
I don't know about you but I lived
in the 80s and the 90s and the 2000s.

96
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,960
I don't know about you but it turns
out I have been abusing a drug.

97
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,640
I don't know about you,
I ate a lot of hot dogs.

98
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,120
I don't know about you

99
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,120
but when I think of flirty talk it's
not of the racist nature.

100
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,480
I don't know about you but
I don't need lactation service.

101
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,880
Moving on: our main story
concerns the fact

102
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,720
that one of America's most sacred
annual traditions is upon us.

103
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,720
Everything comes down to this.

104
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,880
Bring the noise.

105
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,840
As good as it gets.

106
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,240
March is on.

107
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,960
Holy shit !
Yes, March is on !

108
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,920
Fuck you, February !
And April, I'll see you in hell !

109
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,920
It's March o'clock, assholes !

110
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,400
The first round of March Madness,
the year's biggest college tournament

111
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,760
starts on Tuesday and
the nation will be watching.

112
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
Which means big money.

113
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,280
March Madness now brings in over
a billion dollars in TV ad revenue.

114
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,200
A billion dollars ! That's more
than the Super Bowl.

115
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,000
It's almost more than the entire
NFL post-season, combined.

116
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,280
Seems a lot, until you consider
the number of ads they pack in.

117
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,560
Sponsored by Lexus.

118
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,680
AT&T at the half is presented
by AT&T.

119
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,880
Our game is brought to you
in HDTV by HP.

120
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,440
Coke Zero presents
real fans of NCAA March Madness.

121
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,040
Soon, the only thing left to sponsor
will be the sponsorships themselves.

122
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,280
Pepsi presents a Geico look at
Nabisco's Toyota moment of the game

123
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,080
brought to you by Taco Bell !

124
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,760
Everything about
this tournament is branded.

125
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,960
Even the famous moment
where players cut down the net.

126
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,000
Werner Ladder proud to donate
to the general scholarship fund

127
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,080
of every school in the final four.

128
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,440
Werner, the official ladder of
the NCAA basketball championships.

129
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,360
Are you kidding me ?
A Werner ladder ?

130
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,680
As a ladder enthusiast, I can tell you
Werners are pure shit.

131
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,040
Unless you want a broken back,
in which case go with Werner.

132
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,880
But you'd be better off slapping
on a pair of stilts on a yoga ball.

133
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,040
I'm a DeWalt man.
I'm not a ladder idiot.

134
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,240
There's nothing wrong with a sporting
tournament making huge amounts.

135
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,280
There is something troubling about
a billion dollar sports enterprise

136
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,640
where the athletes
are not paid a penny.

137
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,120
As the head of the NCAA will tell you,
they don't want that to change.

138
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,240
There's not even a salary to debate.
They're students.

139
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,200
They're not employees,
they're student athletes.

140
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,400
Student athletes are students,
they're not employees.

141
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,600
The only other people who say
they're not employees that much

142
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,160
are people who run illegal
sweatshops out of their basements.

143
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,440
They're not employees ! It's a summer
camp where they make the same t-shirt,

144
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,000
thousands of times,
it's summer fun, year-round.

145
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,320
When you don't pay people,
there are consequences.

146
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,240
One of the players who climbed
the ladder was Shabazz Napier,

147
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,240
who let slip
a startling fact after one game.

148
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,520
Sometimes, there's hungry nights
when I'm not able to eat

149
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,720
and I still gotta play
up to my capabilities.

150
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,000
There are hungry nights
that I go to bed and I'm starving.

151
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,440
Hunger Games should take place
annually in a dystopian future,

152
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,160
not every March sponsored
by Coca-Cola on CBS.

153
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,120
NCAA insists that student athletes
cannot be paid, they are amateurs.

154
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,920
Though they've slightly softened
their rules on food,

155
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,080
they still exercise a ridiculous
amount of control over players.

156
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,640
Before they're allowed to compete,

157
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,320
athletes have to sign this form,
saying that they are amateurs.

158
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,440
They give up any compensation
for playing and promise to abide

159
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,160
by all the rules
in this 440-page manual.

160
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,880
A 400 odd page manual of rules.

161
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,280
The only other thing that has that
many finicky little rules

162
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,800
would be a sex party
at Wes Anderson's house.

163
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,800
Guests are required to wear lingerie
of a prewar, Andalusia vintage.

164
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,640
Fellatio accompanied by music from
the Kinks and early Cat Stevens

165
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,880
and condoms shall be found inside
a diorama of the sinking of Lusitania.

166
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,800
Now everybody fuck.

167
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,600
The NCAA rule book
is not just for show,

168
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,520
as a New Mexico player
discovered a few years back.

169
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,000
A discount on a hotel ballroom
is the imperissable benefit

170
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,040
and NCAA violation that
caused Fenton to be suspended.

171
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,080
He was suspended for unwittingly
receiving a $250 discount

172
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,960
on a ballroom
for his 21st birthday party.

173
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,600
And by the way,
a discounted ballroom...

174
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,160
Are we sure he was turning 21
and not celebrating

175
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,480
his 40th wedding anniversary
with his lovely wife Marion,

176
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,680
that would make more sense.

177
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,280
Some rule enforcements go from
the petty to the heartless.

178
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,080
The late Rick Mejarus,
when he was at Utah,

179
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,240
had one of his players
who'd lost one of his parents.

180
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:19,520
He took him to lunch before putting
him on a plane to send him home

181
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,640
and the NCAA said
that was a violation,

182
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,720
you can't give an athlete something
you don't give another student.

183
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,800
Sure, I get that, if you show
one player basic human decency

184
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,640
you have to show everyone
basic human decency.

185
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,960
Nobody wants that.
And to be fair here,

186
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,160
NCAA claim that while student
athletes are not being paid,

187
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,480
they are compensated
with something valuable.

188
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,960
We provide them with
opportunities to get an education

189
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,160
at the finest universities on earth,
American universities and colleges.

190
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,600
Athletes are paid in an education.

191
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,000
The only currency more difficult
to spend than bitcoin.

192
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,640
A four-year education
is undeniably valuable.

193
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,320
Assuming that one, you don't get
hurt and lose your scholarship,

194
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,080
which can happen,
and two, you have time to study.

195
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,720
If you're a student playing
top-level basketball or football,

196
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,320
that can be difficult.

197
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,440
Listen to Richard Sherman
reminisce about his college days.

198
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,640
In the morning,
you have weights at this time.

199
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,320
After weights you go to class.
And after class,

200
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,960
you go maybe
to grab you a quick bite to eat.

201
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,720
Then you go to meetings.
After meetings you got practice

202
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,160
and after practice you got to try
to get all the work done.

203
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:42,840
I would love for a regular student
to have a student athlete's schedule

204
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:48,360
for just one quarter
and show me how you'll balance that.

205
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,360
Paying top college athletes with
education is like telling a nurse:

206
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,480
There's no salary for this job.
We'll give you free trumpet lessons.

207
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,760
But if you don't learn to play,
you're fired.

208
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,600
Does that sound fair ?
I think that sounds fair.

209
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,400
And the education athletes
do get is sometimes watered-down.

210
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,040
Last year, an investigation revealed
that the University of North Carolina

211
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,200
had held so-called paper classes
that boosted athletes' grades.

212
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,040
Football and basketball players,
they would be enrolled,

213
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,360
steered to and enrolled in a paper
class in African American studies.

214
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,320
We could have football player who
in the spring might have a GPA of 1.4,

215
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,240
but in the summertime
we put him in 3 paper classes

216
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,800
and we get, A, A, A minus,
and lo and behold,

217
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,360
he's academically eligible
to play football in the fall.

218
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,600
Let's not pretend it isn't something
offensive

219
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,280
about African American studies course
being an easy major:

220
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,640
take this class investigating social,
political, cultural complexities

221
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,200
inherent to the black American
experience, it'll be a breeze !

222
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,960
Phone the thing in.

223
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,680
And it gets worse.
Because many student athletes at UNC

224
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,680
also left
with an unusual language credit.

225
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,280
- What language did you study ?
- Swahili.

226
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,400
- Swahili ?
- Yes.

227
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,960
- Does that come in handy ?
- No, not at all.

228
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,720
- What language did you take ?
- I took Swahili.

229
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,880
- Do you speak Swahili, a bit ?
- As of right now, no.

230
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,360
Encouraging black student athletes
to take bullshit Swahili courses

231
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,640
is the institutional prejudice which
might well turn up

232
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,560
in one of their African-American
studies courses.

233
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,440
Student athletes don't get paid
and sometimes don't get educated.

234
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,560
But what they do get is the chance
to learn from coaches

235
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,480
who will take them under their wing
and provide them with life lessons.

236
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,680
Fuck you. And fuck me. And fuck
everybody. That is fucking bullshit.

237
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,880
That is inspirational.

238
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,920
Someone should put that
on a cat poster.

239
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:19,280
While this mistreatment is happening...
Iit's a good poster, lifts your spirits.

240
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,440
While this mistreatment is happening,
huge money is being made.

241
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,760
Sometimes, the NCAA makes money
off players years afterwards.

242
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,120
A few years ago, the NCAA
proudly licensed this video game,

243
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,880
a game whose selling point
was authenticity.

244
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,560
The crowd, the noise,
the cheerleaders.

245
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,560
The intensity of the game,
the passion of the game.

246
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,120
It's all about authenticity.

247
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,440
The level of authenticity
is extremely deep.

248
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,160
I thought the only people obsessed with
how authentic something was

249
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,280
are people from San Diego
talking about Mexican food.

250
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,480
I get it, Kendall, but there are
avocados everywhere now.

251
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,320
We've all got them now.

252
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,680
That game was so authentic, it created
an awkward moment for Ed O'Bannon,

253
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,680
a former UCLA star player who
works at a car dealership in Las Vegas.

254
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,040
I was with a friend
and he said that his son

255
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,480
had a video game with me in it.

256
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,600
You wanna go check it out ?
So, yeah, of course.

257
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,160
Left-handed, height, weight,
skin color, bald-headed,

258
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,080
it was me for sure.

259
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,560
I'm thinking to myself,
they got me on the video game.

260
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,240
While his kid was playing,
he almost whispers in my ear,

261
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,280
the crazy thing about this
is that you didn't get paid.

262
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,800
First of all, I don't know who that
kid was, but that's a dick move.

263
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,800
Ed ? Pretty crazy how
you got nothing for this, right Ed ?

264
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,560
Must be pretty humiliating,
right, Ed ?

265
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,800
About you not getting
any money for this, Ed ?

266
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,120
Pretty annoying, right Ed ?
Are you annoyed, Ed ?

267
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,640
Are you annoyed right now, .Ed ?
Is it annoying to you, Ed ?

268
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:14,120
They actually don't make that game.
Ed O'Bannon sued the NCAA

269
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,080
over their rules on compensating
athletes, and won.

270
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,040
NCAA is appealing that decision,
which would allow players to be paid.

271
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,440
Partly because, as they often claim,
schools could barely afford it.

272
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,960
14 schools out of the 1 100 last year
had positive cash flow

273
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,240
out of intercollegiate athletics.

274
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,080
It's anything but a money making
proposition for universities.

275
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,640
We have sports for the same reason
Mariah Carey has an acting career.

276
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,560
God knows it's not to make a profit.
It's for the love of the game.

277
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,920
That's the principle.

278
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,480
He's not wrong that many departments
barely break even.

279
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,440
That's misleading. For the schools
that generate most of the money,

280
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,640
those losses
are sometimes by design.

281
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,120
Profits are what's left
when you account for expenses.

282
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,800
They can come up
with an awful lot of expenses,

283
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:10,720
of salaries, they find a ton
of ways to spend a ton of money.

284
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,840
In keeping
with their nonprofit status,

285
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,120
schools spend money to make it look
like they're not making too much money.

286
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,040
It's like when your rich friend
buys Diesel jeans with holes in them.

287
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,680
C'mon Brayden, we all know you can
afford to have warm knees.

288
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,760
You're not fooling anyone, B.

289
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,960
When rich schools do this
to move money around,

290
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,560
not-so rich schools end up getting
into an arms race to compete.

291
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:41,720
Why the 10 largest football stadiums
in the country belong to colleges.

292
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,160
University of Michigan has claimed
that, on game days,

293
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,960
their stadium is the fourth-largest
city in the state of Michigan.

294
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,760
Also the one with the fewest rusted
out auto-plants run by raccoons.

295
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,560
They're doing their best.
Stadiums are just the beginning.

296
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,080
Alabama made
an MTV Cribs-style video

297
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,680
showing off their ludicrously
opulent football facilities.

298
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,800
One of the best features I think
of the locker room,

299
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,440
is the hydrotherapy area.

300
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:15,840
We have a hot tub and a cold tub,
but really they're pools.

301
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,880
I never thought I'd say this,
but:

302
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,160
Alabama, stop showing off
your ostentatious wealth !

303
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:30,040
It is not just buildings
that schools spend money on.

304
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,760
Mississippi State coach Dan Mullen
was just given a raise,

305
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,240
pushing his salary
to $4 million a year.

306
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,440
$7 million a year
for the next 8 years,

307
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,840
Alabama coach
Nick Saban's new deal.

308
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,040
University of Kentucky
announced a $52 million,

309
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,120
7-year contract extension with
basketball coach John Calipari.

310
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,120
America has a long, proud
history of paying aging white men

311
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,000
unconscionable amounts
for screaming at people.

312
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:04,560
I'm saying there's precedent there.
This makes it even harder to swallow

313
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,360
when some coaches,
like Clemson's Dabo Swinney,

314
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,640
who makes over $3 million a year,
insists that his players not get paid.

315
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,800
As far as paying players,
professionalizing college athletics,

316
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,400
that's where you lose me.

317
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,120
I'll go do something else, there's
enough entitlement in this world.

318
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,600
Wait, if you find that infuriating,
you might like to know

319
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,720
that "Dabo Swinney" is an anagram
for "soybean wind."

320
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,640
It's fitting, because he seems
as pleasant as an edamame fart.

321
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:45,040
And the fact that his name's
an anagram for "soybean wind"

322
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,240
it's not relevant,
but I thought it was worth mentioning,

323
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,040
because it feels like something
he'd be annoyed by

324
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,800
and would not want people to know
on a wide basis.

325
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,640
Hashtag soybean wind.

326
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,960
And by the way,
the larger point is,

327
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,880
Swinney has trademarked his name
for use on shirts.

328
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,400
He's allowed to do that.
The NCAA manual explicitly states

329
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,120
coaches are free to pursue
endorsement or consultation contracts.

330
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,040
And players are aware
of this discrepancy.

331
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,840
Here's former University
of Michigan basketball star Jalen Rose.

332
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,200
The revenue stream for coaches
people underestimate.

333
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,680
You get paid from the school,
from camps, from apparel company,

334
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,160
have a TV deal,
you have your radio show.

335
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,600
That's 5 revenue streams.
So when I come into practice

336
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,760
and I miss a couple of shots
and I dribble it off my foot,

337
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,480
and coach says:
Jalen, what's going on with you ?

338
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,800
My mother's lights about to get
cut off, that's my problem.

339
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,840
Sometimes it must be tough to focus
on your lights-out shooting

340
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,800
when your mother's lights
are literally going out.

341
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,560
If you think, they'll all get rich
when they become professionals,

342
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,080
that's true
in a fractional number of cases.

343
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,400
Less than two percent of college
basketball and football players go pro.

344
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,760
If you're an athlete who dreams
of being a Viking or a Wizard,

345
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,360
you probably
have the same chance of becoming

346
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,480
an actual viking
or an actual wizard.

347
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,240
And all of this assumes
they manage to stay healthy.

348
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,360
If  they get injured, a whole host
of other problems can emerge.

349
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,280
The first executive director
of the NCAA stated

350
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,840
he crafted the term student
athlete in the 1950s,

351
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,920
to avoid workers' comp
for injured athletes.

352
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,360
And 60 years later,
that term is still working.

353
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,240
Kyle Hardrick was so good that

354
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,800
Oklahoma offered him a scholarship
in ninth grade.

355
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,640
But after a knee injury,
he lost his scholarship

356
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,960
and with medical bills piling up,
he couldn't afford to stay in school.

357
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,920
If it was workman's comp,
my son would've been taken care of.

358
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,120
He would've been
able to finish his college.

359
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,720
He was promised an education
and he got one

360
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:05,160
in how little schools sometimes give
a shit about their student-athletes.

361
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,760
This whole system
seems fundamentally flawed.

362
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,880
Yet the NCAA constantly insists
there is no way athletes can be paid

363
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,320
even a nominal amount,
because...

364
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,640
The notion of converting a student
to a paid employee

365
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,320
is antithetical to the principle
of intercollegiate athletics.

366
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,840
It changes the notion
of what college sports is all about.

367
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,160
I think you might be right.

368
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,960
If college sports is all about
exploiting people, then, yes,

369
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:42,520
paying athletes would change
what college sports are all about.

370
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,800
No one is saying that they need
to be paid millions,

371
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,120
or hundreds of thousands,
or the same amount,

372
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,080
or even that every school
needs to pay every athlete.

373
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,480
But to pay everyone zero
when the kid selling their jersey

374
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,440
gets ten dollars an hour
seems a little bit strange.

375
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,520
If it truly is all about the romance
of amateurism, that's fine.

376
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,960
Give up the sponsorships, the TV deals,
stop paying the coaches,

377
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,600
and have teams run by an
asthmatic anthropology professor.

378
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,600
But if you are going
to change nothing,

379
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,040
at least be honest about
the business you're engaged in.

380
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,360
Feel free to bring back
your video games,

381
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,120
but in the spirit of authenticity,
that seems to matter so much,

382
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,400
make them a little more accurate.

383
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,080
Rated "E" for "exploitative".

384
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,400
New from LWT Sports !
March Sadness 2015,

385
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,760
the most authentic college
basketball game of all time.

386
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,000
Any game can give you
the excitement of college athletics

387
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,160
but that's only
about 2% of your week.

388
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,440
You'll get to experience
the other 98%.

389
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,800
What are you, a fucking idiot ?!
I'm gonna fucking kill you !

390
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,600
You pass like a fucking pussy !

391
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,120
You'll enjoy the fun
of being screamed at

392
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,320
by a middle-aged millionaire while
living in fear of losing scholarship.

393
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,360
Be it from a career-ending injury,
accidentally accepting a free lunch

394
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,600
or directly profiting in any way
from the value of your work.

395
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,080
Making money's antithetical to
the principle of collegiate athletics.

396
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,280
But don't take it from us.
Take it from the unwilling star

397
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,360
of EA's NCAA Basketball '09,
Ed O'Bannon.

398
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,320
This game is as fucked up
as the real thing.

399
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,680
You'll get to create your own player
and enjoy an authentic experience

400
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,160
because our game puts just as much
emphasis on an education

401
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,960
as a real NCAA Division I
school does.

402
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,280
Are you ready for your Swahili exam ?
Congratulations, you speak Swahili.

403
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,920
Now, back to the gym.

404
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,280
It's the most authentic
college game of all time.

405
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,040
As other unpaid star of NCAA
Basketball, Jalen Rose, will attest.

406
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,680
That's pretty much what it's like.

407
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,360
And this year, if you play LWT's
NCAA March Sadness,

408
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,360
you can play in 2 new modes.

409
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,160
Coach mode: which consists
of screaming at 18-year-olds.

410
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,200
Asshole ! I'm gonna
kill all of you entitled assholes !

411
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,200
Or you can choose
school administrator mode,

412
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,720
figuring out how to somehow
remain a non-profit.

413
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,640
You want a stadium
across from your stadium ?

414
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,760
How about a rocket ship ?
But be careful,

415
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,040
because if you use a penny of that
money to play your players, game over.

416
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,960
No matter which mode you choose,

417
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,600
you're guaranteed all the joy
of top level college athletics.

418
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,520
March Sadness 2015. LWT Sports.
It's in the shame.

419
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,440
This game is some bullshit !

420
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,840
That's our show, thanks for watching.
See you next week. Good night !

421
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,880
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

422
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,720
END OF EPISODE 6,
SEASON II
