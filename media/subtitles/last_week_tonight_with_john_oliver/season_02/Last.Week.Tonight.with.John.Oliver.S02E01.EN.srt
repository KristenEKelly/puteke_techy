00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,320
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,840
SEASON II, EPISODE 1

3
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,800
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,320
It is so great,
o great to be back with you.

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,800
Clearly, we have been gone
for the last three months,

6
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,560
and you're probably thinking
I was on vacation.

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,320
That was not in fact the case.

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,240
Much like Brian Williams,
I voluntarily took myself off the air

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,520
after it emerged I presented
false information to you last year.

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,000
Roll the clip !

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,800
My theory always was that Hemingway
was hung like a hamster,

12
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,200
not that there's anything wrong
with that.

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,240
There's absolutely nothing
wrong with that.

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,040
We Googled "hamster penis,"
and this is what you find ! Adorable !

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,640
I'm embarrassed
to say that it turns out

16
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,320
that is not, in fact, a hamster penis,
it is a hamster tail.

17
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,840
I would like to truly apologize
to you the viewers,

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,600
to the editorial staff here,
and most of all to that hamster

19
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,280
because you deserved better,
Niblet, you deserved much better.

20
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,680
So with that out of the way,
with trust we built,

21
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,120
let's move on
to a quick recap of the week.

22
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,160
It began with a glorious looming
scandal in the US Congress.

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,440
Illinois Congressman Aaron Schock
being asked a lot of questions,

24
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,560
after redecorating
his Capitol Hill office suite

25
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,560
in the style of the PBS TV
series Downton Abbey.

26
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,640
What better way to show you're
in touch with your constituents

27
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,880
than decorating your office in the
manner of a 1920s British aristocrat ?

28
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,280
I'm intrigued. How Downton Abbey-ish
is his office ?

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This is Schock's office.
Bright red, a gleaming chandelier.

30
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,080
Just like on television.
And a vase of pheasant feathers.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,200
Pheasant feathers !

32
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,040
Somewhere in Illinois there is a
pheasant freezing his ass off going,

33
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,960
you couldn't just pick
something up at West Elm ?

34
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,720
Have you ever heard
of a eucalyptus bundle ?

35
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,000
Unbelievable !

36
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,480
The Congressman had some explaining
to do. And explain he did.

37
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,680
What do people back home
in Peoria think of this ?

38
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,600
I've never been a old,
crusty white guy.

39
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,600
You know as Taylor Swift says,
haters are gonna hate.

40
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,120
Ok, a couple of things there.

41
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,640
You are definitely
an old crusty white guy

42
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,960
if you think Taylor Swift was the first
person to say "haters gonna hate".

43
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,080
But, to be fair to him,
quoting "Shake It Off"

44
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,360
is probably as close as a congressman
can come to saying

45
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,120
"Go fuck yourself,
my office is magnificent."

46
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,440
Haters gonna hate, shake it off !

47
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,320
Moving on, to what may have been
the most spectacularly

48
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,880
ill-advised moment
in diplomacy this week.

49
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,240
Argentina's embattled
President Cristina Fernandez

50
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,480
under fire for a tweet
during a state visit to China

51
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,960
after meeting
with the Chinese President.

52
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,280
If you're thinking, "How bad could
a tweet from a world leader be ?"

53
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,000
This bad...

54
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,040
Fernandez tried to mimic
a Chinese accent

55
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,400
by switching R's with
what appeared to be maybe L's ?

56
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,800
In a tweet that translates
as did they only come

57
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,080
for lice and petloleum
instead of rice and petroleum.

58
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,120
Holy Shit !
"Lice and petloleum."

59
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,120
That is a level
of clueless racism on the internet

60
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,000
you'd expect
from a Dartmouth sorority pledge.

61
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,960
And perhaps... You're the worst !

62
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,880
And perhaps
the most amazing thing

63
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,040
is that she tweeted this during a
vitally important four-day state visit.

64
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,160
They're negotiating
15 major agreements,

65
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,000
which include two huge
hydroelectric dams in Patagonia,

66
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,000
investment in ports
through which Argentina

67
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,520
exports thousands
of tons of soil to China

68
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,080
and military hardware.

69
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,440
I have to say it's actually pretty big
of China to just go ahead

70
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,480
with their negotiations
like nothing had happened.

71
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,560
If I were them, I would've served
President Kirchner a bowl of lice,

72
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,360
saying "here's your food,
here's that funny joke you said,

73
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,360
why don't you eat your funny joke.

74
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,160
You still owe us
billions of dollars by the way."

75
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,880
Finally this  week, there was sad news
for a true American icon.

76
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,880
RadioShack the 94 year old
consumer electronics chain

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,160
has filed
for bankruptcy protection.

78
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,960
Half of its 4,000 stores
will be turned into Sprint locations.

79
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,920
The others will be shut down.

80
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,960
You know it's a rough day when
"2,000 new Sprint locations"

81
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,800
is the happy part of a sentence.

82
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,120
RadioShack has not been
in great shape in recent years.

83
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,040
But it's easy to forget it
once ran ads like this.

84
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,600
So much more than just a store,

85
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,920
the best in America,
RadioShack,

86
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,080
nobody compares to RadioShack.

87
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,080
That is a catchy song my friends !
If they had left that on the air,

88
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,200
they'd be the most powerful
company on earth today.

89
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,800
The death of RadioShack
in itself is not surprising.

90
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,240
What is surprising is the glib,
jokey tone

91
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,720
with which its demise has been
discussed over the past year.

92
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,680
If you have the name Radio
in your corporate name,

93
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,880
that's not a good sign in 2014.

94
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,160
Is RadioShack doomed
to remain a punch line ?

95
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,320
I actually like RadioShack
I go there a few times a year

96
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,840
and I kinda like it,
I'm an old school guy.

97
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,840
You must have a very
full junk drawer is all I can say.

98
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,640
This is a dying
94-year-old business !

99
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,920
It's like you're sitting across
from your grandfather saying:

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,360
"I don't really see the point
of Grandpa Fred in 2015.

101
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,640
Frankly, I'm sort of surprised
he still exists."

102
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,800
RadioShack would be
well within its rights

103
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,480
to be a little hurt
at this level of disrespect.

104
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,080
We've prepared
a farewell message for them,

105
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,120
that they should feel free to use.

106
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,960
For nearly a century,

107
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,680
we at RadioShack
have proudly served America,

108
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,560
providing you with the highest quality
home electronics at the best prices.

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,280
And now, sadly,
it's time for us to say goodbye.

110
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,080
So we would like to offer this special
farewell message to America.

111
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,800
Go fuck yourselves.
That's right.

112
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,360
Take a thirty pack of batteries
and shove them up your ass.

113
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,240
Who sold your parents
that remote control car

114
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,640
you got for Christmas in 1993
that you loved so damned much ?

115
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,000
RadioShack motherfuckers !

116
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,440
Remember in 1989 when you needed a
cable to plug your Nintendo in the TV ?

117
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,000
Who was there for you ? That's right.
RadioShack again assholes.

118
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,960
And now look at you,
laughing at our slow, painful death.

119
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,800
Laugh while you still can,
shit heads.

120
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,840
Because one day,
you too will be obsolete.

121
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,000
You too shall be left behind in the
wake of time's ceaseless onslaught.

122
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,400
And when that day comes, we'll be
standing over your goddamned grave,

123
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,080
laughing our asses off.

124
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,080
So America,
from all of us here at RadioShack,

125
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,840
goodbye and go to hell
you filthy animals.

126
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:54,360
Moving on ! Our main story tonight:
prescription drugs.

127
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,560
The only ovals that can bring people
in the Seattle area joy anymore.

128
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,440
Too put it mildly,
America takes a lot of these things.

129
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,120
70% of Americans take
at least one prescription drug,

130
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,480
more than half of us take two.

131
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,360
Researchers say a record 4 billion
prescriptions were written in 2011.

132
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,360
Total drug spending
jumped last year by 3 percent

133
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,360
to nearly 330 billion dollars
with a "B."

134
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,760
That works out to 1 000 dollars
per person on prescription drugs.

135
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,040
Kind of makes you feel
like Walter White

136
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,120
could've made more money cooking up
rheumatoid arthritis medication.

137
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,600
But should this really be
that surprising ?

138
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,400
It's impossible
to escape pharmaceutical ads.

139
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,200
You can't turn on the TV
without being subjected

140
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,880
to an endless stream
of sleep-inducing moths,

141
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,720
old men getting boners
while varnishing chairs, or this.

142
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,320
If your bladder
is calling the shots,

143
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,080
you may have a medical condition
called overactive bladder or OAB.

144
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,720
Again ? But we just went.

145
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,920
What that woman
really needs is a pill

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,080
to stop her hallucinating
anthropomorphic bladders.

147
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,240
You're locked inside a prison
of your own mind, Susan !

148
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,480
Be gone demon bladder !

149
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,280
But that's only one small part
of pharmaceutical marketing.

150
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,640
Drugs aren't like
most other products,

151
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,560
because you need someone's
permission to buy them.

152
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,720
Which is why all drug ads
end with the same catchy phrase.

153
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,400
Ask your doctor if Lunesta
is right for you.

154
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,800
- Ask your doctor about Myrbetriq.
- Ask your doctor.

155
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,640
Three words you're either hearing in a
commercial or saying to your coworker

156
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,760
when he asks you if the mole
on his back looks cancerous.

157
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,320
"I don't know ! Ask your doctor !
All I said was "how was your weekend ?"

158
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,320
It's probably fine.

159
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,560
Drug companies know

160
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,600
doctors hold all the real power
in the prescription drug business.

161
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,040
Which is why, while they spend
nearly 4 billion dollars a year

162
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,640
marketing directly to us,

163
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,680
they spend 24 billion dollars
a year marketing directly to doctors.

164
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,680
One analysis claimed that, in 2013,
9 out of the top 10 drug makers

165
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,880
spent more on marketing
than they did on research.

166
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,200
Drug companies are a bit
like high-school boyfriends:

167
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,240
they're much more concerned
with getting inside you

168
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,880
than being effective
once they're in there.

169
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,080
So we thought,
okay, don't think about that too much.

170
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,880
We thought we'd take a look,

171
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,800
we thought we'd take a look at how
all that marketing money gets spent.

172
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,720
Which turns out
to be surprisingly difficult.

173
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,600
It's a secretive world you usually
only get tantalizing glimpses into

174
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,880
during lawsuits,
years after the fact.

175
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,440
In 2012,

176
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,600
the government settled a case with the
makers of asthma medication Advair

177
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,720
over allegedly irresponsible
marketing practices.

178
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,040
We were able to see this video
of a 2001 Advair sales meeting.

179
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,240
Ladies and gentleman,
please welcome Darrell Baker,

180
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,240
Simon Jones, Rob Yacht
and Ken Tyba.

181
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,440
What the fuck !
That was for an asthma medication !

182
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,000
And they were treating it
like an NBA pregame show !

183
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,080
"Please welcome ! He's 59, white,

184
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,400
he likes turkey sandwiches
and his wife's name is Karen,

185
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,360
Say hello to Daryl
boom-boom Baaaaaaaker !"

186
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,800
The audience in that room
were pharmaceutical reps.

187
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,640
The foot soldiers in every
company's drug-marketing efforts.

188
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,640
Drug companies will tell you, their
reps are there to educate doctors,

189
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,920
but behind closed doors,
that message can be different.

190
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,280
There are people in this room

191
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,520
who are going to make an ungodly
sum of money selling Advair.

192
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,840
You know who you are.

193
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,320
Ungodly, that would barely
be an appropriate tone

194
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,480
if they were trying to get cereal
into people's bodies, let alone drugs.

195
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,680
You don't need to see
the people whooping in that room

196
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,360
to know what they look like.

197
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,200
Pharmaceutical sales reps
are famously young, attractive people.

198
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,960
This is so widely known, it's become
a sitcom punch line for years.

199
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,080
Today's the day the pharmaceutical
reps show up to peddle new drugs.

200
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,200
And at Sacred Heart,
that means one thing: Julie's here.

201
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,720
If something is a joke on "Scrubs",
you know it's common knowledge.

202
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,720
That show did not do a lot of arcane,

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,520
"What is it with phlebotomists
and French cuisine, am I right ?"

204
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,520
You are right Turk,
we're great friends.

205
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,440
The problem comes
if those reps don't understand

206
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,920
the effects of the drugs
they're pushing.

207
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,400
Listen to one former rep
describe his first training session.

208
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,360
I was in a room with
21 classmates and 2 trainers

209
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,360
and I was the only one
with a science background.

210
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,880
In fact on the first day of training
I taught my class and my instructors

211
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,240
the very basic process
by which 2 brain cells communicate.

212
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,480
So essentially, pharma reps
are like the cast of Grey's Anatomy:

213
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,720
they're young, hot and they have
virtually no medical training.

214
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,280
To be fair, most doctors will probably
take that into consideration.

215
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,560
The problem
comes when some don't.

216
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,040
I even had one physician who
would often bring out a patient chart

217
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,280
if she was having
a difficult patient,

218
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,680
she'd bring out a patient chart
and be like, okay Kathleen,

219
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,160
I've tried this, what do you recommend
in terms of tweaking ?

220
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,880
And I'm sitting here thinking,
I'm a political science major.

221
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,880
You're asking me
what to prescribe for this patient.

222
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,440
Because the only question a Poli Sci
major is really qualified to answer is:

223
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,360
"Was it weird having to move back in
with your parents after college ?"

224
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,160
Now if you're thinking,
if you're thinking at this point,

225
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,840
why do doctors let drug reps
into their offices at all ?

226
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,440
They don't come empty handed,
they'll show up with free samples.

227
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,600
And, even better,
free chicken parm.

228
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,920
Whoever said there's
no such thing as a free lunch,

229
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,080
hasn't worked
in a doctor's office.

230
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,240
There are some offices that advertise
in the front desk job description,

231
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,560
free lunch everyday.

232
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,520
Because the drug reps
are bringing it everyday.

233
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,600
Free lunch every day !

234
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,880
That might not seem like a big deal,
but think about it: lunch is awesome.

235
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,040
If Charlie Manson brought me
a free lunch every day,

236
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,560
I'd at least listen to his sales pitch
on forehead swastikas.

237
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,920
I don't think it's for me, Charlie,
but that's delicious.

238
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,560
Drug companies do it
because they know it works.

239
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,480
They know a terrifying amount

240
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,640
about nearly every prescription
coming out of a doctor's office.

241
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,000
Every time a patient goes into a
pharmacy to get a prescription filled.

242
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,480
The information
is sold to drug companies

243
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,720
who send it to laptops
out in the field.

244
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,240
So we see everything
that the doctor does.

245
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,720
How many prescriptions he prescribes
of our medication and the competitor's.

246
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,360
If the computer shows a doctor's
not prescribing as promised...

247
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,360
You say: "You're banging out
a lot of prescriptions"

248
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,360
"for the competitor's drug
and not mine.

249
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,440
Carl, you seem
to be making medical decisions

250
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,200
based on your best judgment.

251
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,480
I brought you a meatball sub with
chips, Carl, don't fuck me on this !

252
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,640
Don't fuck me Carl.

253
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,440
With this level of pressure,

254
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,320
unsurprisingly, drug companies
have crossed the line,

255
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,000
pushing doctors to prescribe pills
for non-FDA-approved uses.

256
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,480
That's called "going off label".

257
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,600
Here is a horrifying example
involving Astrazeneca,

258
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,680
the government charged
with going "off-label" with Seroquel,

259
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,640
an anti-psychotic
with dangerous side effects.

260
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,640
The allegations,
which were very troubling,

261
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,320
were that they were taking a drug
approved for fairly narrow uses

262
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:00,120
bipolar disorders and schizophrenia
and marketing it for everything

263
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,240
from sleeplessness
to depression and dementia.

264
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,360
You can't give people

265
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,800
potentially dangerous drugs
and see what happens !

266
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,880
You're a fortune 500 company,

267
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,640
not a white guy
with dreadlocks at burning man !

268
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,840
Astrazeneca denied any wrongdoing,

269
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,080
but it paid half a billion dollars
to settle the lawsuit.

270
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,840
If you're thinking,
"One company with one drug",

271
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,600
know that just about
every major drug company

272
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,200
has paid money
to settle similar charges.

273
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,200
Johnson & Johnson paid 2.2 billion.
Eli Lilly paid 1.4 billion.

274
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,240
Pfizer and its subsidiary
paid$2.3 billion.

275
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,880
And Glaxo Smith Kline paid out
a record 3 billion dollars

276
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,560
to settle accusations that it had
pushed Wellbutrin, an antidepressant,

277
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,520
as a cure for weight gain
and sexual dysfunction.

278
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,280
Or, as one former drug rep
describes the pitch.

279
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,640
It was a quick zinger for your doc
to tell your doctor:

280
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,760
"Remember Wellbutrin ?
The happy, horny, skinny drug."

281
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,840
That's not just irresponsible,
that's copyright infringement.

282
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,280
There is only one happy, horny,
skinny drug, and that is crystal meth.

283
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,840
That's a fact,
so that's a fact right there.

284
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,440
For that increasing number of doctors
who will refuse even to see drug reps,

285
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,360
the companies have one
other trick up their sleeve:

286
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,000
simply paying doctors
to talk to other doctors

287
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,200
about their products over dinner.

288
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,880
And that sounds ridiculous.

289
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,640
But not as ridiculous as the special
ego-boosting title they use.

290
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,600
I essentially say to a doctor,

291
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,280
our company has identified you
to be a thought leader.

292
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,280
Would you like to be
a thought leader for our company ?

293
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,240
The doctor will normally
almost every time say yes.

294
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,880
Of course they say yes ! Doctors like
to be called "thought leaders"

295
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,880
the same way that Brendan Fraser
likes being called

296
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,960
"two-time academy award
winner Brendan Fraser."

297
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,120
Not true, but it's got a lovely ring
to it and look how happy it makes him.

298
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,920
Look it, give the guy a go,
look how happy he is.

299
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,200
For a position described
as "thought leader,"

300
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,840
not a lot of thought
goes into the job.

301
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,400
In many cases the slides
and the content and the script

302
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,360
are prepared
by the drug company.

303
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,680
It's not always clear to the audience
that this is material that was scripted

304
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,240
completely by the drug company that
was paying the doctor to give the talk.

305
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,760
So if you're a doctor
just regurgitating a script,

306
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,840
you're not a "thought leader"
so much as you are "thought sayer."

307
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,440
Abraham Lincoln
was a "thought leader."

308
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,800
You're more like the animatronic
Lincoln at Disneyland.

309
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,280
To be fair: Glaxo Smith Kline will
no longer pay for "thought leaders".

310
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,480
And the industry in general claims
they're reforming.

311
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,880
A spokeswoman for Pharma,
the drug industry's trade group,

312
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,160
has even bragged about the tough new
restrictions they put in place.

313
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,840
In our Pharma code, we say
that pharmaceutical representatives

314
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,440
can bring an occasional meal,
a modest meal.

315
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:07,360
Turkey sandwiches, pizza,
I don't want to focus on turkey,

316
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,760
maybe we could have
ham sandwiches.

317
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,760
But modest meals,
not steak in a restaurant.

318
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,640
No, not in a restaurant !

319
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,400
Although we'd probably allow
a steak at an Outback Steakhouse.

320
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,320
That's a chunk of horsemeat with grill
marks drawn on it with a Sharpie.

321
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,600
So no one's getting ethically
compromised by that.

322
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,520
This voluntary Pharma code is I guess
a step in the right direction.

323
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,680
So let's see how one of their members
have been abiding by it.

324
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,120
The justice department
filed a civil fraud lawsuit

325
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,440
against the Swiss
drug maker Novartis,

326
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,240
accusing it of paying kickbacks
and lavishly spending on doctors,

327
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,880
including taking some out to Hooters
in exchange for prescribing its drugs.

328
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,920
Don't worry, research has shown
the best medical decisions

329
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,320
are always made with an
Arizona State College football game

330
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,080
blasting in the background.

331
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,040
But at least Hooters
qualifies as a "modest meal".

332
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,640
They also paid doctors to speak
at places like L-2-0 in Chicago,

333
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,680
a restaurant whose Zagat
review reads, and I quote,

334
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:21,160
"Tabs may bring tears to your eyes,
so many say it's for special occasions

335
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,560
unless, of course,
you go on someone else's dime."

336
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,200
I'm guessing at the end of the meal,
the waiter came over and asked

337
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,560
"Separate checks ? Or one person
is buying your influence ?

338
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,560
Just one is it ? That's very nice
of him, there you go."

339
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,120
And at least
they were there for that one.

340
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,600
Many doctors took payments
for speeches they never even gave.

341
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,000
All of which Novartis has denied,

342
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,880
saying that everything they did
had a legitimate business purpose,

343
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,360
and besides,
speaker programs like theirs

344
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,600
are an accepted and customary
practice in the industry.

345
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,840
Which is kind of the whole point:
even in its best form,

346
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,960
hiring doctors as paid spokesmen
seems like a conflict of interest.

347
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,960
And multiple reports have found
that many drugs' top prescribers

348
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,080
are also often getting money
from that drug's company.

349
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,080
Which is worrying.
Because we trust doctors.

350
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,760
When you see Rihanna trying
to get you to drink coconut water,

351
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,240
you know
she's getting money to do that,

352
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,440
and you take that into account...

353
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,920
"I'm glad you're getting paid, Ri-Ri.
But I'm not going to drink that.

354
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,680
Because you and I both know
that coconut water

355
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,440
tastes like cereal milk
mixed with bull semen.

356
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,080
We both know that,

357
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,600
so I'm going to take that into account
when I make this decision for myself."

358
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,680
I know this has all been disheartening,
but luckily,

359
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,080
there is actually
some good news here.

360
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,480
A new clause in the affordable
care act will for the first time ever,

361
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,240
allow average citizens
to search a federal website

362
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,080
to see the perks given to physicians
by pharmaceutical companies.

363
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,080
I know what you're thinking:
what a federal web site ?

364
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,200
Made up of a list of doctors ?
Let me command T up a new tab !

365
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,200
This website
is actually kind of fascinating.

366
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,960
The first batch of numbers are online,
covering the last five months of 2013.

367
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:16,200
You can, and should go online and
look up your doctor at this address.

368
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,800
Maybe you'll find your doctor did
a little research for a drug company.

369
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,760
Or maybe, as Pro Publica did when
they looked at Pharma payments,

370
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,200
you'll find a doctor who's earned
more than a million dollars

371
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,960
delivering promotional talks
and consulting.

372
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:36,040
Or maybe you'll find a doctor who got
food and beverages worth four cents.

373
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,640
I have to know
what that meal was !

374
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,920
The only way a four-cent meal makes
sense is if that doctor is a mouse.

375
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,320
That's the only way
it makes sense.

376
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,680
Wipe Cheez-it dust off your whiskers
before you prescribe me anything.

377
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,760
There is information
on this database you should know.

378
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,720
This should be the beginning.

379
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,400
If drug companies
want to regain our trust,

380
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,120
maybe they should let us know
the effect their money has on doctors

381
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,840
in the only way they know how.

382
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,440
Have you noticed
anything strange about your doctor ?

383
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,200
Does he seem happier
than usual these days ?

384
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,840
Is he quick to prescribe drugs
you think you might not need ?

385
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,240
One more actually.

386
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,520
Does his waiting room
frequently feature

387
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,480
surprisingly attractive,
not sick looking people ?

388
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:32,000
That may be because your doctor
has been taking pharmaceutical money.

389
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,920
Pharmaceutical money takes forms
from free lunches to speaking fees.

390
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,600
Here's how it works:

391
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,960
money combines with the cash
receptors in your doctor's wallet

392
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,640
to create
fast acting financial relief

393
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,720
so your doctor
can rest easy and enjoy life.

394
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,720
Common side effects
of doctors taking money

395
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,120
may include
chronic over prescription,

396
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,680
unusually heavy cash flow,
dependency on free samples,

397
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,200
inflammation of confidence,
affluenza,

398
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,440
and an increased tendency to suggest
off-labeled prescriptions,

399
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,160
which in turn
can cause heart attack, stroke,

400
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,160
loss of feeling in arms and legs,
seizures,

401
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:19,920
blurred vision, grinding of the teeth,
temporary deafness, total blindness,

402
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,160
numbness, sudden bursts of rage,
reduction of trust,

403
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,840
angry erections lasting
over 17 hours, and death.

404
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,120
Ask your doctor today if he's taking
pharmaceutical company money

405
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,680
then ask your doctor
what the money is for.

406
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,400
Ask your doctor
if he's taken any money

407
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,040
from the companies who made
the drugs he just prescribed for you.

408
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,280
Then ask yourself
if you're satisfied with that answer.

409
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,000
Pharmaceutical money, ask your doctor
if his taking it is right for you.

410
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:58,640
Finally tonight:
a quick word about Ecuador.

411
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,560
Ecuador's President is Rafael Correa
a charismatic leader

412
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,440
who once a week does an address
to the nation he calls "Citizen Link",

413
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,000
where some amazing things
can happen.

414
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,360
Yes ! That is how a president
should address a nation !

415
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,880
Every presidential speech from now
on should have somewhere within it,

416
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,120
in brackets, "clown enters."

417
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,720
These addresses
can clearly be pretty fun.

418
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,640
Unfortunately,
they can also take a darker turn.

419
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,160
Yes, darker even than a clown

420
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,400
because Correa frequently
uses them as a platform

421
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,680
to attack people
he feels insulted by.

422
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,480
He's ripped up newspapers
that have criticized him.

423
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,760
He doesn't realize that newspapers
tend to print more than one copy.

424
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,800
Last week, it got even worse,
when for some reason,

425
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,120
he decided to start calling out
individuals, by name,

426
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,400
who had been abusing him
on twitter.

427
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,720
Another little angel,
he is @tuiterovendido.

428
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,040
His real name
is Johan Arturo Caicedo Rovira.

429
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,240
So young. What a shame.
He's 18 years old, very young.

430
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,040
18... so young, so immature !
Unlike me,

431
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,240
the 51-year-old head of state who
is currently attacking him in public."

432
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,480
To be fair to him that 18 year old had
expressed a hope that Correa would die.

433
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:41,120
Correa should have people who take
care of that sort of thing for him.

434
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,120
Rather than spending,
like he did,

435
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,800
nearly 15 minutes
calling out online trolls.

436
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,600
Even attacking
one individual's Facebook page.

437
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,520
The little angel,
and I didn't even know his name.

438
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,680
He was just Crudo Ecuador.

439
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,840
He's got a whole bunch
of trash on his page.

440
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,040
Of course he has,
that's what Facebook is !

441
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,760
It's pages full of trash !

442
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,680
Stop Googling yourself,
you're president of Ecuador !

443
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,880
He explicitly encouraged his supporters
to tweet back at his attackers.

444
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,400
We are more. We will respond
in the exact same way my friends.

445
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,360
If they send 1 tweet, we'll send
10,000 because we are 10,000 to 1.

446
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,280
How are you now
getting involved in a Twitter war ?

447
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,960
You do know no one
has ever won one of those, right ?

448
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,080
It's impossible.
Look, President Correa:

449
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,720
if you're this sensitive, then Twitter
and Facebook might not be for you.

450
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,080
And to be honest, being a world leader
might not be for you,

451
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,480
unless you can build up
your tolerance for personal abuse.

452
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,040
Trust me: I've been through this.
I used to be very sensitive,

453
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,640
then I became a comedian,

454
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,200
and I got insulted so much
I can't feel anything anymore.

455
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,560
It's made me stronger as a person.
Emptier and stronger.

456
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,680
So you don't need less abuse,
you need more,

457
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,440
you need more abuse
to tip you over the edge.

458
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,600
So allow me
to help you right now !

459
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,840
President Correa:
nice smug smile you've got.

460
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,600
You look like a used
Jeremy Piven salesman.

461
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,600
You look like every
real housewife's third husband.

462
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,120
You're the only president
for whom this might be

463
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,360
the single most dignified moment
of your presidency.

464
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,960
By the way,
what the hell is happening here ?

465
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,720
That's a necklace
made out of penises.

466
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,080
That's not even a joke !
That's a dicklace around your neck !

467
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,440
And don't get offended by this,
President Correa.

468
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,520
Because if your skin was any thinner,
you'd be a taint.

469
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,520
So don't get offended !

470
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,920
I think we all know
what that music means:

471
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,840
a psychotic clown is about
to tell me my time is up !

472
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,320
But I would encourage
all of you to tweet insults

473
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,080
directly to President Correa's
Twitter handle

474
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,720
all this week to help him
get over his oversensitivity.

475
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,640
That's our show, thank you so much
for watching, good night !

476
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,600
END OF EPISODE 1,
SEASON 2
