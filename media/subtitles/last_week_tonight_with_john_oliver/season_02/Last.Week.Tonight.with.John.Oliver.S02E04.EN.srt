00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,360
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,440
Season II, episode 4

3
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,720
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,160
A quick recap of the week.
And we begin in Russia.

5
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,200
The future home
of 45 million Ukrainians.

6
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,160
On Friday, there was
some terrible news.

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,720
A breaking story out of Moscow.

8
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,960
The murder of  Russian opposition
leader Boris Nemtsov.

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,640
The 55 year old politician
was gunned down

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,080
less than 2 days before he was to
lead a rally against President Putin.

11
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,040
That would seem
like a shocking coincidence

12
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,000
if you knew nothing
about Russia.

13
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,160
Nemtsov is the latest
in a long line of Putin's enemies

14
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,240
to find themselves mysteriously
imprisoned or dead.

15
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,120
Nemtsov was asked in an interview
if he was afraid Putin might kill him.

16
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,600
And his answer was:
yes, a little bit.

17
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,800
At the end of that interview,
the journalist said to him:

18
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,400
"I hope common sense will prevail
and Putin will not kill you."

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,280
Sounds chilling, but to be fair,
"I hope Putin will not kill you"

20
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,240
is just how Russian people
say goodbye to each other.

21
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,040
Thank you for dinner, Dmitri.
I hope Putin will not kill you.

22
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,360
Thanks !
I hope Putin will not kill you, too.

23
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,440
We won't know who killed Nemtsov
until the investigation is complete.

24
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,680
There's one problem with that.

25
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,640
Tonight, Vladimir Putin says
he will personally take charge

26
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,200
of the investigation
into Nemtsov's death.

27
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,120
Yes, this will be detective Putin's
greatest mystery

28
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,600
since the case of the missing
Crimean peninsula

29
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,600
that I would like
to take back now.

30
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,600
Let's give Putin
the benefit of the doubt.

31
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,080
His investigation made
an early breakthrough

32
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,920
and it turns
out he's not involved.

33
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,400
President Putin condemned the murder,
calling it a contract killing.

34
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,160
He launched an investigation
into the murder

35
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,520
and said it bears
the hallmarks of a contract killing.

36
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,280
I will find whoever is responsible
for this contract killing

37
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,080
and make sure they are paid
whatever it is that I owe them.

38
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,280
So I will do that.
Let's move on to Washington D.C.

39
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,640
There was big news from the FCC.

40
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,240
It is a historic decision
for how Americans surf the net.

41
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,240
The FCC approved
sweeping net neutrality rules.

42
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,880
Yes ! Cable and telecom companies
will not be allowed to create

43
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,440
a two-tiered fast lane
and slow lane on the internet.

44
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,440
All of us will be treated the same
when we upload and share pictures

45
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,680
of a gold and white dress.

46
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,040
It's gold and white.
I will fight every one of you.

47
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,440
When we talked
about this last year,

48
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,320
we likened Tom Wheeler,
the head of the FCC,

49
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,120
to a dingo babysitter,
due to the fact

50
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,800
he once ran the cable
industry's lobbying arm.

51
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,600
Which prompted this response.

52
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,720
I would like to state for
the record that I'm not a dingo.

53
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,680
Yes, you are. You are a dingo.

54
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,720
It's just that in this one instance,
you did not eat the baby.

55
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,400
Good dingo !
Good babysitting, dingo. Keep it up.

56
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,320
Good news. Not because consumers
and entrepreneurs are happy,

57
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,240
but because
internet service providers are sad.

58
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,720
No one reacted more
passive-aggressively than Verizon.

59
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,640
Verizon putting out
this press release,

60
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,840
objecting to what
they call 1930s style rules.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,760
They put out the press release in
Morse code to emphasize their point.

62
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,480
Petty. And by the way,
Verizon, I'll say this for Morse code.

63
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,120
At least it didn't drop out
for no reason

64
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,600
anytime people walked
into their kitchen.

65
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,200
There's a dead zone by the stove,
just wave the machine around a bit !

66
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,480
It appears that some members
in Congress are on Verizon's side.

67
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,800
After FCC's ruling, one of them took
to the house floor to disagree with it.

68
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,440
The Obama majority on the FCC
seized unprecedented control

69
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,720
over the internet under
the guise of net neutrality.

70
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,240
Net neutrality's the notion that the
latest cat video is of equal importance

71
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,480
to a teleconference
consultation for a heart patient.

72
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,400
What if the latest cat video is
a teleconference for a heart patient

73
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,360
with Doctor
Larry Meowberg-Fluffstein ?

74
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,080
Because he's excellent.

75
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,840
You are misunderstanding
what net neutrality is.

76
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,480
Cat videos are part of the point.
Net neutrality is keeping providers

77
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,320
from picking and choosing
whose voices get heard.

78
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,840
Ensuring that the internet remains
a democratic space.

79
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,440
Even if all a message
contains is this.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,680
No !

81
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,240
Yes !
That's freedom.

82
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,240
Finally, a quick word on history.

83
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,760
Or as Ken Burns calls it,
pornography.

84
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,000
This week brought shocking news
about a fact

85
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,640
everyone was taught
in history class.

86
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,680
The rat has had
a bad wrap over the centuries.

87
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,640
By far, its most deadly offense,
spreading the Black Death

88
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,840
across the world in the 14th century,
killing 75 million people.

89
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,360
Seems that rats have been the victims
of one of history's biggest framings.

90
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,080
First: history's biggest framings
are inside Mariah Carey's living room

91
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,160
and they are around
oil paintings of Mariah Carey.

92
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,760
If rats didn't spread the plague,
who did ?

93
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,880
Scientists in Norway believe it may
have be this: the little gerbil.

94
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,280
Gerbils ?!
Let me get this straight:

95
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,080
the Black Death, the plague which
nearly wiped out human civilization,

96
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,680
may have been caused
by Mr. Nibbles here ?

97
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,880
If rats have been falsely accused,
we need to make amends.

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,680
I live in New York,
so I'm reasonably certain

99
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,240
there are at least thirty rats
within five feet of me right now.

100
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,680
So gather 'round, rats.
We've made a video just for you.

101
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,920
Humanity's placed the blame for one
of its greatest calamities

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,160
squarely at the feet
of the common rat.

103
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,320
The Black Death, was the result
of bubonic plague spread by rats.

104
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,880
This turns out to be false. With
great humility, we, the human race,

105
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,160
apologize to the rat community
for centuries of demonization.

106
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,760
Apologies, rats.
You deserve better.

107
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,480
Now, as for you,
you devious gerbil bastards.

108
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,400
All this time, we've been
buying wheels for you to run on,

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,200
constructing elaborate
gerbilariums for you to inhabit

110
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,680
and making hats for you,
specially made hats.

111
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,560
Which granted, you pulled off.
But that's not the point !

112
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,320
All this time, you whiskered fucks,
you may have been responsible

113
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,080
for casting a grim shadow of death
over human civilization.

114
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,240
We oughta smack you right in
your incredibly cute glassy eyes !

115
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,680
So here's the deal,
play time's over, assholes !

116
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,240
We, the human race, are pissed off.

117
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,720
We're real pissed off
and we demand an apology.

118
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,640
We don't care how you do it.
Write it with scraps of newspaper.

119
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,440
Chew it into a toilet paper roll.
Spell it out in your own shit.

120
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,000
Just get it done, gerbils.
Get. It. Done.

121
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,520
Just to reiterate, sorry to rats.

122
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,400
Moving on. Our main story
tonight is about infrastructure.

123
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,200
It's our roads, bridges, dams,
levees, airports, power grids,

124
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,320
anything that can be destroyed
in an action movie.

125
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,560
Get out of there !

126
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,520
God damn it !

127
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:13,120
Holy shit ! If an alien species
judged humanity by our movies,

128
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,720
they'd think we were furious
with asphalt all the time.

129
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,680
When our infrastructure is not being
destroyed by robots

130
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,880
and/or saved by Bruce Willis,
we tend to find it a bit boring.

131
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,160
Infrastructure is not a sexy
or glamorous topic.

132
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,000
I'd like to think otherwise,
but infrastructure is not sexy.

133
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,160
Infrastructure's not very sexy.

134
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,520
Infrastructure, like those men we just
heard is important, but not sexy.

135
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,480
Although, that may just be
because Hollywood promotes

136
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,440
unrealistic standards
of infrastructure beauty.

137
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,560
That's not what a real road looks
like ! Real roads have curves !

138
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,280
So most people think
infrastructure is boring.

139
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,560
But is it ? I'd argue that
it's actually pretty fascinating.

140
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,360
In saying that, I have become
the rad youth counselor

141
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,080
trying to convince you that
Jesus was the Taylor Swift of his time.

142
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,480
Revelations is a break-up song
to the Romans, guys.

143
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,800
Who wants another mountain dew ?
Catch.

144
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,480
Let's talk about infrastructure.
And let's begin with dams.

145
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,320
Dams are amazing !

146
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,360
They're the most powerful device
we have for holding back liquid,

147
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,840
aside from the idea of using
a porta-potty.

148
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,480
I'll wait. I'll just wait forever.
I canot go in there.

149
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,680
America used to love dams.

150
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,880
Grand Coulee Dam, in Washington,
the world's biggest concrete structure.

151
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,840
The Boulder Dam stands today
a modern colossus.

152
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,480
The walls of the new dam tower
like mighty modern pyramids.

153
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,400
Yes and we built those dams
with ingenuity and brawn

154
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,240
and of course,
piles and piles of dead Irish.

155
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,960
They're good workers

156
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,000
and their corpses make
a solid foundation material !

157
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,280
That's an architectural fact.
But these days,

158
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,920
America's once-great dam system
is in a state of serious disrepair.

159
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,480
The average age of the country's
84 000 dams is 52 years

160
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,960
and many have problems that stem
from when they were built.

161
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,360
Yes, much like most Botox recipients
and competitive cloggers,

162
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,600
the average dam is 52 years old
and has something broken inside.

163
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,560
You would think a statistic like that
would terrify people into action.

164
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,480
Many states are paying
no attention to their dam problems.

165
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,440
In 2007, the last year
for which statistics are available,

166
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,920
Texas had just 7 inspectors
responsible for 7 400 dams.

167
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,600
That's over 1 050 dams
per inspector.

168
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,040
The state was only able
to look at 239 dams.

169
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,880
Alabama doesn't have an inspection
agency to monitor its 2 000 dams.

170
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,640
Zero inspectors !
That means that the state of Alabama

171
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,520
has exactly the same number of dam
inspectors as the band Alabama.

172
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:18,280
We are doing a terrible job of
maintaining all of our infrastructure.

173
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,120
The nation's infrastructure of bridges,
roads and pipelines

174
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,440
is in need of renovation.

175
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,320
They get nothing more than a D+.

176
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,600
A D+ ! America got the same grade
that a 10th grade teacher

177
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,800
gives a nightmare kid so she doesn't
have to deal with him for another year.

178
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,600
No, Landon. We're not calculating
the surface area of our penises.

179
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,280
Just give him a D+
and say he has family troubles.

180
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,600
I cannot even deal
with that shit again.

181
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,480
That D+ grade came from the
American Society of Civil Engineers,

182
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,600
who would benefit from
more infrastructure spending.

183
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,000
It's a bit like having the state
of our nation's tennis balls

184
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,200
assessed by the American
Society of Golden Retrievers.

185
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,280
They're dangerously under-thrown !
This must change.

186
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,560
We've been such good dogs !

187
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,480
But other studies have also found
our infrastructure is lacking.

188
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,600
The world economic forum
ranks America 16th in the world.

189
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,160
We need to be better.

190
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,320
When infrastructure fails,
bad things happen.

191
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,320
Like last year, when a pipe burst
and flooded the campus of UCLA.

192
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,560
A water main break in West Los Angeles
turned the UCLA campus into a river.

193
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,160
Students walked through ankle-deep
water and in some cases,

194
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,960
tried to have fun.

195
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,040
I've been chilling here for 20 minutes
trying to get the best view.

196
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,840
I just came from the gym.
I got kicked out, 'cause of the flood.

197
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,280
It looked insane,
there's so much water.

198
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,800
It's like, I've never
seen so much water,

199
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,480
except for like, lakes, I guess.

200
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,160
When infrastructure is damaged,
it's not just incredibly expensive.

201
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,560
It can be lethal. From the big stuff,
like bridge collapses and dam failures,

202
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,800
to the little stuff, like potholes.

203
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,080
Gone at 53 years old,
Al Lee slammed his bike

204
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,760
into a pothole riding along Grizzly
Peak Boulevard in Oakland.

205
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,840
His wife, Nancy, says a car
then hit him head on.

206
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,400
Roadways need to be paved. That's why
we have infrastructure.

207
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,120
That's why we pay our taxes.

208
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,000
That's horrifying.
But the problem is,

209
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,920
we seem to talk about infrastructure
when something tragic happens.

210
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,120
The scale of this problem is scary,

211
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,160
as the former Secretary
of Transportation points out.

212
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,360
According to the government,
there's 70 000 bridges

213
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,920
that have been deemed
structurally deficient.

214
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,840
It means that there are bridges

215
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,760
that need to be replaced or repaired.

216
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,120
They're dangerous.

217
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,680
I don't want to say they're unsafe,
but they're dangerous.

218
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,000
What ? Hold on.
When we're at a point where

219
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,240
the Secretary of Transportation
is struggling to decide

220
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,320
between using the word unsafe
and the word dangerous,

221
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,240
we might have a problem.

222
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,160
If you want a glimpse into how
close to catastrophe we are,

223
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,520
take this story from Philadelphia.

224
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,720
Two contractors from Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation

225
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,400
stopped to get a sandwich and
parked their cars under this bridge.

226
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,920
Fortunately, they wanted
that sandwich 'cause they saw

227
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,520
one of these piers with an 8 foot
gash in it, about 5 inches wide.

228
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,840
And if they hadn't wanted
a sandwich ?

229
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,640
That bridge would've collapsed.

230
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:49,720
There might have been a disaster
if those contractors hadn't stop !

231
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,120
Which means...we were fine.
We were always going to be fine.

232
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,400
The scary thing is,
what if the next cracked pillar

233
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,880
is next
to a vegan smoothie stand ?

234
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,040
The bridge is going down and
people are going to die.

235
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,680
It's not just Philadelphia. Look
at Pittsburgh, the city of bridges,

236
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,840
and its solution to one
that was deteriorating.

237
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,680
One of these bridges has a structure
under it to catch falling deck.

238
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,400
They actually built that to catch
any of the falling concrete,

239
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,080
so it wouldn't hit traffic.

240
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:28,240
They built a bridge under the bridge !
That is a college sophomore approach

241
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,400
to structural engineering:
the trash was overflowing,

242
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,120
so I put it in the microwave.

243
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,040
Problem solved.
I'm a legend.

244
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,120
There are danger bridges everywhere.
In New York, the Tappan Zee Bridge

245
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,480
is so notoriously shaky,
one government official called it

246
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,520
a hold-your-breath bridge.

247
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,160
The only time we should ever
talk about hold your breath bridges

248
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,560
would be if Beau Bridges
were into autoerotic asphyxiation,

249
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,400
and you were trying to remember
which one he was.

250
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,440
Is he the normal Bridges or is he
the 'hold your breath' Bridges ?

251
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,160
The facts about the Tappan Zee Bridge
are frightening enough.

252
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,440
And yet the History Channel
felt the need to produce

253
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,120
a terrifyingly CGI-filled account
of the worst-case scenario.

254
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,560
Some of the Tappan Zee's foundations
are at risk

255
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,280
and this is what could happen
if they eventually gave way.

256
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,440
Okay, one:
that's very frightening.

257
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,600
Why did the director assume

258
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,520
we'd all had such a strong emotional
attachment to the coffee cup ?

259
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,000
A fucking bridge collapsed.

260
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,360
We aren't just
flirting with disaster.

261
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,280
We're rounding third base and
asking if disaster has any condoms.

262
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,400
And the crazy thing is, ask
any politician from either side,

263
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,600
and they'll tell you that
infrastructure is important.

264
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,400
Everyone agrees on this !
At a recent hearing,

265
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,760
business and labor, the US Chamber
of Commerce and the AFL-CIO,

266
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,520
turned out to support
infrastructure spending.

267
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,800
Even they know how rare that is.

268
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,960
If business and labor can come
before you united on this issue

269
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,520
and we are united on this issue,

270
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,160
despite our short disagreements
on a variety of other matters.

271
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,600
That should tell everybody
something and tell it very loudly.

272
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,720
He's right. The last time business
and labor agreed on an issue,

273
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,520
it was the issue of how dead
should Jimmy Hoffa be ?

274
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,120
They both agreed, pretty dead.
Here's how obvious our need is:

275
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,600
just two days ago,
even a total idiot agreed.

276
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,160
We have to rebuild our infrastructure.
Our roads are crumbling.

277
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,320
Everything's crumbling
and we're rebuilding China.

278
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,200
Glossing over whatever he was
talking about rebuilding China,

279
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,800
that piece of candy corn in a wig
made of used medical gauze is right:

280
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,400
we do have
to rebuild our infrastructure.

281
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,240
So with consensus like this,
how are things so bad ?

282
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,880
One of the problems is, just fixing
things is not politically appealing.

283
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,040
'Cause when you build
something new, you get to do this.

284
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,200
There is nothing politicians like more

285
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,320
than using oversized scissors
to cut through ribbons.

286
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,960
But you don't get to cut
a ribbon after routine repairs.

287
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,760
Infrastructure is like Legos.
Building is fun. Destroying is fun.

288
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,240
But a Lego maintenance set would be
the most boring toy in the world.

289
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,960
It comes built and you maintain it,
and if you do it right,

290
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,080
nothing happens
and eventually you die.

291
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,960
Perhaps the best symbol
for our neglected infrastructure

292
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,040
is the US Highway Trust Fund.

293
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,120
It is the single largest source
of infrastructure funding in country.

294
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,880
Guess what's about to happen to it ?

295
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,840
There's a May 31st deadline.

296
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,400
The Highway Trust Fund
goes bankrupt unless Congress acts.

297
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,640
The fund is about
to run out of money.

298
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,080
Unlike most broke
trust fund recipients,

299
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,600
our highway system can't just
get a job at its daddy's law firm.

300
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,280
Really, Declan ?
What case are you working on ?

301
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,600
And does it contain 24 Miller Lites ?
I hate you, Declan.

302
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,800
The fund is nearly insolvent cause
it's funded by the federal gas tax.

303
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,760
There's one hitch with that.

304
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,240
The Highway Trust Fund
gets revenue

305
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,120
from an 18.4 cent
per gallon gas tax.

306
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,920
But the tax has not increased
to keep up with inflation since 1993.

307
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,000
And the fact that it hasn't increased
means that in real terms,

308
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,720
the gas tax has gone down
39 percent since 1993.

309
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,600
Much like Koosh ball sales
or respect for Bill Cosby.

310
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:19,200
I'd like to think it was more than
that, but sadly, I don't think it is.

311
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,080
You would think
Congress would fix this shortfall,

312
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,600
but we haven't had transportation
legislation for over a decade.

313
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,440
Since 2003, it's barely passed
two partial authorizations

314
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,280
and 23 short-term extensions.

315
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,240
One of which, in July 2005,
was for just two days !

316
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,840
That entire extension lasted half
a Sting orgasm. That's not enough.

317
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:52,000
Why doesn't Washington raise
the gas tax and fund the fund ?

318
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,040
Because that would be
incredibly unpopular.

319
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,160
Listen to what happened
when C-SPAN had a call-in

320
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,320
and asked people whether
the gas tax should be raised.

321
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,840
I don't know that another
gas tax is gonna help us out.

322
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,800
No, they shouldn't
raise the gas tax.

323
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,560
The last thing we need
is new taxes.

324
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:19,720
If gas prices go back up,
we'll be stuck with super high prices.

325
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,040
The government
has plenty of money.

326
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,040
What I want to say is, no.

327
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,080
War on coal, war on gasoline,
war on diesel.

328
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,560
I agree with all of the other
previous callers. Hello ?

329
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,840
Okay. That call-in lasted for an hour
and they did not receive

330
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,760
a single call
in favor of the gas tax.

331
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,560
You would think they'd at least
have been pranked

332
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,800
by Mikey and the Badger,
DC's number one morning zoo crew.

333
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,240
I'd just like to say we should
definitely raise the gas tax !

334
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,600
You've been badgered !

335
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:09,760
In the face of that kind of lack
of public support,

336
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,880
it is hardly surprising that
the White House is not too keen either.

337
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:20,320
The administration has not put forward
a proposal to increase the gas tax.

338
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,240
It seems raising
the gas tax is unlikely.

339
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,680
Fine, as long as you have another
concrete way to raise that money.

340
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,960
So what is
the White House's plan ?

341
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,480
This administration's put forward
an idea by closing a loophole

342
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,960
that allows corporations to benefit
from stashing their profits overseas.

343
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,560
Okay, raise funds
by closing corporate loopholes.

344
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,360
We all know
that is guaranteed to work.

345
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,360
The only obstacle would be,
I know that this is highly unlikely,

346
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:54,240
if there were another corporate
loophole somewhere in the tax code.

347
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,960
One other obstacle. When the president
floated this plan by John Boehner,

348
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,640
he swatted it aside, perhaps because
Boehner favors his own plan,

349
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,560
which he's been talking up
for the past two years.

350
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,280
I'm committed
to find a funding source

351
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,760
so that we can begin to repair
America's aging infrastructure.

352
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,200
The hunt has been underway
to find a funding source.

353
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,480
I wish we've found it,
but we haven't.

354
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:28,120
We've got to find a way to deal with
America's crumbling infrastructure

355
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,840
in a long-term program
that is in fact funded.

356
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,240
Two years and nothing ?
That's an oddly laid back way

357
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,000
to tackle a potentially
catastrophic problem.

358
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,080
If a giant lizard were attacking
our roads and bridges,

359
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,200
you wouldn't spend two years
saying:

360
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,520
I'm committed to preventing
lizards destroying our city,

361
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,520
but we need a long-term program
that is, in fact, funded.

362
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,520
I refuse to believe Boehner
does not have some sort of plan.

363
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,600
We emailed his office and asked,
what is Speaker Boehner's proposal

364
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,640
to raise revenue for
the U.S. Highway Trust Fund ?

365
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,040
We didn't hear back. So we emailed
someone else in the office.

366
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,160
Still nothing. So we called
the office. Still nothing.

367
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,920
We sent him this tweet, asking:
Mr. Speaker, how specifically

368
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,280
will you raise revenue for
the U.S. Highway Trust Fund ?

369
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:29,040
Hashtag happy birthday Justin Bieber,
to make sure that he would see it.

370
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,920
Then, still nothing.
Then we found out that he's on Vine,

371
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,680
because apparently
he's 14 in 2013.

372
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,680
So we sent him this.

373
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,160
How specifically would you raise
revenue for the Highway Trust Fund ?

374
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,520
Is that 6 seconds ?
It feels a lot longer.

375
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,160
Still nothing.
He still didn't get back to us.

376
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,520
The lack of political urgency
in tackling this problem is insane.

377
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,960
You cannot tell me that you
are not interested in this

378
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,160
because every summer, people flock
to see our infrastructure threatened

379
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,760
by terrorists or aliens.

380
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,440
We should care just as much

381
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,840
when it's under threats
from the inevitable passage of time.

382
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,320
No one has made a blockbuster movie
about the importance

383
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,520
of routine maintenance
and repair.

384
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,960
Or they hadn't, until now.

385
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,400
In a world where a few feet
of concrete can mean the difference

386
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,920
between life and death,

387
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,480
where everything you love can be
taken from you in the blink of an eye,

388
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:37,160
a few brave souls are willing to risk
everything to make nothing happen.

389
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,160
- Hello ?
- It's time.

390
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,800
- Excuse me ?
- For your biennial bridge inspection.

391
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,960
I've got Thursday afternoon,
or Friday anytime before three.

392
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,880
This summer, get ready for:
Infrastructure.

393
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,200
Brace yourself for 98 heart-pounding
minutes of incremental maintenance.

394
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,640
I'm not showing any cracking,
no delamination,

395
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,360
no spalls on the concrete deck,
but you got mild corrosion.

396
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,200
You're gonna have
to keep an eye on that.

397
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,720
- Thank you, sir.
- Don't get cocky.

398
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,320
The New York Times
calls Infrastructure "necessary"

399
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,640
and "something I never thought
about, but... yeah. Sure."

400
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,040
Jesus, God, Bobby !
Behind you !

401
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,360
Seepage.
This thing is gonna blow !

402
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,200
In fifteen to twenty years,

403
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,720
which is why it's so important
that we caught it early.

404
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,440
In this line of work,
one mistake could be catastrophic.

405
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,600
It's loose, boss.
The bolt is loose.

406
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,600
Then tighten it, goddamn it.

407
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,200
- I don't know which way.
- Okay, listen to me !

408
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,800
Lefty loosey.
Righty tighty.

409
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,320
Talk to me, what's going on ?

410
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,400
It's good.

411
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,360
Rolling Stone says: "nothing happens
and that's probably for the best."

412
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,040
I came here to chew bubblegum
and inspect bridges.

413
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,280
You want to see terrible puns about
engineering you don't understand ?

414
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,600
Looks like somebody needs
to get their ducts in a row.

415
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,600
You want to see monologues on
the structural integrity of girders ?

416
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,000
I'm ordering uniaxial tests of the slab
transverse to the deck corrugations

417
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,760
with reinforcement and tension
tests of the support connections

418
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,040
between the deck
and the girders, bitch.

419
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,880
You want more thrilling routine
maintenance than you can handle ?

420
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,560
They used PVC piping when
they should've used CPVC piping.

421
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,960
God help us.

422
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:00,880
You want to see: Infrastructure.
Featuring an all-star cast,

423
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,360
plus two-time Academy Award
nominee Edward Norton.

424
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,920
Sorry. Three-time Academy Award
nominee Edward Norton.

425
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,280
And introducing, as the chief,
Steve Buscemi.

426
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,480
I'm the best dam inspector
in the business

427
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,080
and I'm here to inspect this dam.

428
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,720
Coming summer 2015:
Infrastructure.

429
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,080
If anything exciting happens,
we've done it wrong.

430
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,760
- Sausage sandwich ?
- Of course.

431
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,600
That's our show ! Thank you
for watching. Good night.

432
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,320
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

433
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,160
END OF EPISODE 4,
SEASON II
