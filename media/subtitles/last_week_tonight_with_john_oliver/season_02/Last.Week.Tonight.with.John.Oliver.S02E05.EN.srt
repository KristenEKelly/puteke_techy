00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,280
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,480
SEASON II, EPISODE 5

3
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,760
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,800
Time for a quick recap of the week.
It was dominated here at home by this.

5
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,800
Breaking news
out of Ferguson, Missouri.

6
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,440
Let's just all agree that
"breaking news out of Ferguson"

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,840
has become
one of the most dread-inducing

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,600
combinations of words
in the English language,

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,880
alongside "Doctor Phil sex tape"
and "vegan cupcakes."

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,000
The Department of Justice
released two reports on Ferguson.

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,800
The first announced
that no civil rights charges

12
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,480
would be filed against Darren Wilson
for the Michael Brown shooting.

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,240
But it was the second
one that had people talking.

14
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,240
The department also officially
released a report that found

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,520
systemic racial bias in the Ferguson
Police Department and courts.

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,960
I don't think anyone was surprised
by the contents of that report.

17
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,520
You needed to read
that report the same way

18
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,160
you needed to read
the reviews of Mortdecai.

19
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,760
You knew
the verdict would be terrible,

20
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,600
it was which particular words
they chose to use.

21
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,160
The report didn't just show evidence
of disproportionate targeting

22
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,800
and violence against African
Americans. It also showed this.

23
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,600
Investigators say
that they found emails

24
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,400
from court officials and
police department, police officers

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,120
racial jokes
that referenced President Obama.

26
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,320
Another message in June 2011,
compared dogs to African Americans,

27
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,440
suggesting the animals needed welfare
because they were mixed in color,

28
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,280
unemployed, lazy, can't speak English
and have no clue who their daddies are.

29
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,960
It's moments like this
that make me glad I'm on HBO,

30
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,480
where you can hear me say this:
fuck those fucking assholes.

31
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,480
This is what swearing is for.

32
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,640
The mayor of Ferguson
went into damage control mode,

33
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,120
inexplicably arguing that we should
not blow this all out of proportion.

34
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,880
These actions
are in no way representative

35
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,080
of the employees
of the city of Ferguson.

36
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,480
In no way representative ?
Did you read the report ?

37
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,120
They were entirely representative.
That's the problem.

38
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,560
These emails were sent from official
city of Ferguson email addresses

39
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,640
to supervisors in both
the Ferguson police department

40
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,440
and the court system,
during work hours.

41
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,560
They couldn't be more representative
of Ferguson city employees

42
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,720
if their signature said, "sent from the
very core of who I am as a person."

43
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,240
I will say, there is one thing
the mayor of Ferguson said

44
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,800
in his press conference
that did made sense.

45
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,680
Today's report
allows the city of Ferguson

46
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,520
to identify the problems
in the entire St. Louis region.

47
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,800
That is true. Because let's be clear:
this is not just Ferguson.

48
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,480
If you need proof,
here's one other example.

49
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,320
A year and a half ago, an African
American police officer in St. Louis

50
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,120
received this letter at work.

51
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,720
It read in part, quote:

52
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,440
"You black expletive.
We want you out of our station.

53
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,000
We want your black expletive dead.
Expletive your medals.

54
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,120
If an aide call comes out
for you we won't respond.

55
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,640
Kill yourself expletive or we will.
Respectfully, south patrol."

56
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,680
I'll tell you
what gets me about that:

57
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,960
ending a racist threatening letter
with respectfully.

58
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,680
Whatever systemic problems
that area may have,

59
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,200
Midwestern politeness
is unshakeable.

60
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,280
I can only assume
that that officer responded,

61
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,800
"Dear assholes,
why don't you racist fucks

62
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,240
shove a burning cross up
your white asses ?

63
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,040
Love and smooches,
your friend and colleague."

64
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,200
So let's move on.

65
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,680
From Ferguson to a slightly less
contentious spot on the globe: Israel.

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,160
Their elections are in two weeks time,
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's

67
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,840
recent ad campaign
has proven controversial.

68
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,720
Islamic state fighters
on the road to Israel.

69
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,960
That's what Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu

70
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,960
is warning voters
in this campaign advertisement.

71
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,160
The message appears
to be that if the center left defeats

72
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,280
Netanyahu's right wing party in the
March 17th parliamentary election,

73
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,080
ISIL will end up taking over.

74
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,200
I'm pretty sure if ISIL
were going to take over Israel,

75
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,720
they wouldn't be politely
waiting until after the election.

76
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,240
Death to Israel !
Pending all precincts reporting !

77
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,080
Respect the process, guys,
stand back.

78
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,160
Meanwhile, one of Netanyahu's
main opponents, Isaac Herzog,

79
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,800
has been running an ad addressing
a slightly less urgent issue.

80
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,320
The Zionist Camp
is the largest movement in Israel.

81
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,280
The reason some of you are undecided
about voting for me is my voice.

82
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,520
Isaac Herzog is apparently
concerned that people hate his voice.

83
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,840
If you're thinking, "why ? He seems
to have a perfectly pleasant baritone."

84
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,920
It turns out, for that ad,
he dubbed his own voice

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,960
with that of a booming announcer.
Which kind of makes you wonder,

86
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,360
how annoying is this guy's voice,
if he's been forced to do that ?

87
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,160
Are we talking Pee Wee Herman
mid-orgasm ?

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,160
Ray Romano possessed
by the ghost of a duck ?

89
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,680
Russell Crowe's
normal singing voice ?

90
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,160
What level of irritation
to the human ear is it ?

91
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,120
I have to hear this horrific
real voice in action.

92
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,840
There is also a growing
disappointment and mistrust

93
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,400
about Netanyahu's
security policy.

94
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,760
That voice is fine !
That's a normal, human male voice.

95
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,480
It's not a great sign
of strong leadership

96
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,200
that the moment
someone criticizes your voice,

97
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,560
you panic
and go hire a stunt-larynx.

98
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,280
But the single greatest campaign ad
from the Israeli election so far

99
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,080
is from the Yesh Atid party,
which consists of,

100
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,080
and this is true,
a three-hour long, single shot

101
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,160
of a man summarizing
his party's achievements,

102
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,560
while someone paints
a mural behind him.

103
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,760
And it is pretty bold to make
a video that literally allows people

104
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,880
to compare you to the experience
of watching paint dry.

105
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:44,520
The single most exciting thing that
happens in that 3-hour video is this.

106
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,640
Give him credit,
he did nail that.

107
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,120
He was two hours and 15 minutes in.
If he'd given himself the hiccups,

108
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,840
they would've had
to start over from the start.

109
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,080
But finally, tonight: Fanta.
The button on a vending machine

110
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,160
to be covered by a piece of masking
tape crudely labeled "root beer."

111
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,960
Fanta was actually in the news
for some spectacular reasons.

112
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,760
Coca Cola has pulled its latest ad
for Fanta in Germany

113
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,440
over an unintended reference
to Nazi Germany.

114
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,000
If you work in advertising,

115
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,760
before you hit the button on any
campaign, someone has to say,

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,920
"We all checked
this thing for Nazi references.

117
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,840
We do not want another Michael Jordan
with a Hitler mustache issue, okay ?

118
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,000
We don't want that to happen again."

119
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,800
Apparently,
Coca-Cola made the mistake

120
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,760
of deciding to celebrate
Fanta's 75th anniversary

121
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,400
by reminding people
of how it was invented.

122
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,560
Coca-Cola explains
how its German plant

123
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,360
was having difficulty
getting the syrup needed

124
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,040
to make Coke in the forties

125
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,720
so bottlers were forced to make
their own sodas, including Fanta.

126
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,880
The reason the plants
had a hard time getting this syrup

127
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,440
was of World War II and trade
embargos against Nazi Germany.

128
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,040
Yes. Fanta was invented
in Nazi Germany.

129
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,440
And if you didn't know that before,
I'm willing to bet

130
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,360
it's the only thing you're going
to associate Fanta with from now on.

131
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,360
It's a good rule that any companies
with historic ties to the Nazis

132
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,080
should generally avoid nostalgia.

133
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,880
There's a reason
that Volkswagen emphasizes things

134
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,240
like the Passat
winning car of the year,

135
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,440
rather than, say, the honors
it won back in the 1940s.

136
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,680
Herbie ! How could you !
You've truly gone bananas !

137
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,600
I will say this, Fanta !
Good luck trying to get people

138
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,440
to forget your connection
to Nazi Germany again.

139
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,560
'Cause I do not think
it can be done.

140
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,680
We at Fanta are aware we've had
some messaging problems recently.

141
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,000
So we just want to remind you
what Fanta is really all about.

142
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,000
It's the cool, crisp, carbonated drink
that marches across your taste buds...

143
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,040
Wait, hold on, not marches,
fizzes across your taste buds.

144
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,200
If you're on the beach on a summer day
think of Fanta as a corridor to the sea.

145
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,200
Wait no, not that.

146
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,400
Just focus on the great taste of Fanta.
It'll annex your thirst.

147
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,160
Not annex. Quench ? Is quench okay ?
Yeah, yeah quench is fine.

148
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,360
We just want to make sure
when you think about Fanta,

149
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,960
you don't automatically think
about Nazis.

150
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,480
Fanta. Nazis ! Shit !

151
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,240
Moving on:
our main story tonight,

152
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,160
our main story tonight
concerns voting.

153
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,160
Yesterday marked the 50th anniversary
of the first Selma march,

154
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,720
one of the pivotal moments
which led to the Voting Rights Act.

155
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,520
But voting rights in this country
much like John Travolta's hair

156
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,800
are still very much
a work in progress.

157
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,520
There are the obvious obstacles
for many Americans,

158
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,360
such as increasingly
restrictive voter-ID laws.

159
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,680
There's also the less obvious ones, as
Congress was reminded just this week.

160
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,600
As we commemorate 50th anniversary
of the march on Selma this week

161
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,680
and the subsequent passage
of the Voting Rights Act,

162
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,760
I want to call again to the attention
of my colleagues here in Congress,

163
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,440
that there are still American citizens
who do not have equal voting rights.

164
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,960
These are citizens
of America's island territories:

165
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,720
the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Guam and the Northern Marianas.

166
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,360
American citizens
living in U.S. island territories

167
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,480
do not get to vote for president.

168
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,480
That's the kind of unsettling fact

169
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,080
that deep down, you probably knew,
but chose not to think about,

170
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,920
like the fact that the dog from
Full House is definitely dead by now.

171
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,440
That kind of thing. But, more than
you're proving my point.

172
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,400
More than 4 million people
live in the U.S. territories

173
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,280
more than 98 percent of them
are racial or ethnic minorities.

174
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,960
The more you look into the history of
why their voting rights are restricted,

175
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,680
the harder it is to justify.

176
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,520
'Cause it goes all the way back
to when America first acquired them.

177
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,520
The United States flag
is flying over these lands

178
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,280
and so some people said, doesn't
that mean American laws apply ?

179
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,520
In 1901, the insular cases. Basically
the judgment of the Supreme Court

180
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,160
was that the new territories
were inhabited by quote, "alien races"

181
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,200
and they may not be able
to understand Anglo-Saxon laws.

182
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,120
The Constitution
doesn't have to apply.

183
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:44,120
Alien races can't understand
Anglo-Saxon principles.

184
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,720
I find that condescending,
and I'm British.

185
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,240
We basically invented
patronizing bigotry.

186
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,200
I do so wish we could explain
the concept of voting to them,

187
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,200
but their savage little coconut brains
would probably just collapse.

188
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,800
I'm assuming it's coconut milk.
We'll soon see. Whacky stick !

189
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,920
If that does not set off
some alarm bells for you,

190
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,800
the man who wrote the lead decision
in the first of those rulings

191
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,040
was Justice Henry Billings Brown,
who, fun fact:

192
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,640
wrote the famous "separate but equal"
decision in "Plessy v. Ferguson".

193
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,080
And even he suggested
these exceptions to the Constitution

194
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,400
should only stand "for a time"
as in, a temporary arrangement.

195
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,160
But it's been 114 years !
It's like, for over a century,

196
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,400
America's computer has been saying,
"update to your country is available"

197
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,000
and we've been clicking
"remind me later" again and again.

198
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,880
So tonight, let's look
at voting rights in the territories,

199
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,600
and we'll begin in Puerto Rico,
whose citizens are Americans.

200
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,000
A fact that comes as a surprise
to a shocking number of people,

201
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,760
as we learned when Sonia Sotomayor
was named to the Supreme Court.

202
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,000
Sotomayor is the daughter
of Puerto Rican immigrants.

203
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,840
A first generation American,
daughter of Puerto Rican immigrants.

204
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,960
The daughter
of Puerto Rican immigrants.

205
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,640
She's the daughter of Americans
who moved from Puerto Rico.

206
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,080
If Puerto Ricans are immigrants,

207
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,360
anyone who moves "anywhere"
is an immigrant.

208
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,640
"Could you help me
immigrate apartments on Saturday ?

209
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,960
I need to immigrate a couch
up two flights of stairs."

210
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,880
Puerto Rico has more American
citizens than 21 U.S. states.

211
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,400
But less voting rights
than any of them.

212
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,680
And whether or not
they choose to become a state,

213
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,120
they have a delegate in Congress
who can't do much.

214
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,000
My constituents cherish
their U.S. citizenship

215
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,360
and have made countless
contributions to this country.

216
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,120
They cannot vote for president
have no U.S. senators

217
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,720
and send one delegate to the house

218
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,120
who has a voice
but no vote in this chamber.

219
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,080
It's pretty infantilizing,
when discussing national legislation,

220
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,320
to give Puerto Rico the same status
as a six-year-old

221
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,480
voting on where the family
should get to go on vacation.

222
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,480
"What's that, Timmy ? Narnia ?
Colonial Williamsburg it is then.

223
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,520
You were heard, Timmy."

224
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,720
The same voting rights restrictions
apply to the residents of Guam

225
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,200
the Pacific territory that sounds
the most like a Batman punch.

226
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,360
There is nothing
not to love about Guam.

227
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,000
A beautiful island in a strategically
important location for the US military

228
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,360
so much so, their bases currently
occupy over a quarter of Guam's land.

229
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,280
And the residents of Guam
have no say

230
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,240
in general elections
for their Commander in Chief.

231
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,560
Which is even harder to swallow
when you consider this...

232
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,880
According to Guam's office
of Veteran's Affairs,

233
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,040
at least one in eight adult
Guamanians is a veteran,

234
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,920
among the highest percentages
of all U.S. states and territories.

235
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,240
Guam gives a quarter of its land
and as much as an eighth of its people

236
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,600
to the U.S. military.

237
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,440
At this point, the American flag should
really just be a guy from Guam

238
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,960
waving an American flag.

239
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,480
And yet, due in part to their
lack of full voting rights,

240
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,680
those veterans
are shamefully underserved.

241
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,120
In 2012, Guam ranked dead last
in per capita spending on medical care

242
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,280
by the U.S. Department
of Veteran's Affairs, the V.A.

243
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:40,200
It's called the PTSD program locator.
So it tells me to enter my address.

244
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,240
5 options here but the closest one
so far looks like Hawaii.

245
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,040
It's 3,803 miles,

246
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,400
point 22 miles.

247
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,400
That is disgusting.

248
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,880
The only person who should have
to travel 3,800 miles for treatment

249
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,040
should be a Beverly Hills housewife

250
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,040
flying to Colombia
for unapproved lip injections.

251
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,120
But just because Guam residents
aren't allowed to vote for president,

252
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,880
doesn't mean that they don't.

253
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,200
Guam holds a straw poll
every presidential election.

254
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,600
And their registered-voter
turnout is actually higher

255
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,480
than that of the rest of America.

256
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,440
And to misquote the words of the great
philosopher Lil Jon: Turn out for what ?

257
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:43,360
That's a great song.
But just imagine how it must feel

258
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,160
to have the desire to vote, but know
deep down you're going to be ignored.

259
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,120
You don't have to imagine it.
'Cause let this Guam voter tell you.

260
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,480
It's terrible.
I believe it's not fair.

261
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,840
We're citizens of the United States.
I wish somebody changed that.

262
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,800
That sounds sad,

263
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,440
but at least on election day,
that woman gets to wear the special

264
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,520
"I voted and wish it had
actually counted" sticker.

265
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,600
Look, amazingly,
Guam still gets more respect

266
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,360
from the U.S. government
than American Samoa.

267
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,840
As was proven a little while back
when a U.S. member of Congress

268
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,480
was tasked with introducing
their delegate, Eni Faleomavaega.

269
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,720
The chair recognized the gentleman
from American Sa-mo-lia.

270
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,080
Mr. Falamoobinga.

271
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,040
"Samolia" ? Listen: I get that
his name is a little difficult.

272
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,280
But you cannot mispronounce
American Samoa.

273
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,480
There's a fucking Girl Scout
cookie named after it !

274
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,360
Think about it this way:

275
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,760
would you forget the name
of the state of Thinmintissippi ?

276
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,520
No ! That would be ridiculous.

277
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:02,840
But watch how gracious American
Samolia's delegate was in his response.

278
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,360
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
It's American Samoa.

279
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,160
That is class that I do not have.
If I were him, I'd have responded:

280
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,520
"Thank you, it's a privilege
to be here in Waffleton D.P.

281
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,440
in the great United Sporks
of Amooga-boink."

282
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,240
American Samoans
not only lack voting rights,

283
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,560
they lack a little
something extra, too.

284
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,560
U.S. Constitution grants citizenship
to everyone born on U.S. soil

285
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,040
soil except in one jurisdiction.

286
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,120
American Samoa in the south Pacific.
It is a U.S. territory

287
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,400
but people who are born there do not
automatically get U.S. citizenship.

288
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,480
They don't even
get automatic citizenship !

289
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,440
Meaning the "American"
part of "American Samoa"

290
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,320
is really just a title
that doesn't mean anything,

291
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,120
like "people's choice award nominee"
or "social media expert."

292
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,840
Just devoid of meaning.

293
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,480
And that fact is especially shocking
when you learn that American Samoa

294
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,360
a territory that cannot vote for a
president who could send it to war

295
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,160
is also home to the top army
recruiting station in the country.

296
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,240
So now, I'm thinking
the American flag should be

297
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,880
a guy from American Samoa, waving
a flag with a guy from Guam on it,

298
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,520
waving the American flag.

299
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:26,240
Because of their status as non-citizens
many veterans have to carry around

300
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,400
a humiliating reminder that they
are not equal in the eyes of the law.

301
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,440
So this here is my
U.S. national passport.

302
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:43,960
The last page of the passport makes
it uniquely a U.S. national passport.

303
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,680
It makes me look
like I'm an outsider.

304
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,360
I think it's...
it demeans me as a person, I think.

305
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,760
They're not "citizens",
but "nationals".

306
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,000
They can't run for president,
serve on a federal jury,

307
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,840
or depending on where they live
even become a public schoolteacher.

308
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,120
They're like off-brand citizens.
They're Americans in the same way

309
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,680
that these are froot loops,
or this is Dr. Pepper.

310
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,760
You can pretend it's the same thing,
everyone knows it's worse.

311
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,280
Five American Samoans are suing
the government to change this rule,

312
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,960
but the Obama administration
has fought them

313
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,400
by citing the insular cases
from earlier.

314
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,640
Which suggest that American Samoans
like all residents of the territories

315
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,120
can be given fewer rights
because they belong to alien races

316
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,440
differing from us in customs
and modes of thought.

317
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,000
And that's a tricky argument to win,
in the face of this kind of evidence.

318
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,480
- Where you from ?
- I'm originally from American Samoa.

319
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,800
- And what do you do for a living ?
- I'm a solider in the U.S. Army.

320
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,440
I joined out of high school

321
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,720
and it was something to serve
my country and to give back.

322
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,960
We've got back from deployment
to Afghanistan for 9 months.

323
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,720
That is an Afghanistan war veteran
moving an audience to cheers

324
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,160
and at least one judge
to a partial orgasm

325
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,360
with a rendition of a Rihanna song on
a show called "America's Got Talent".

326
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,280
If that's not an American,
I don't think one has ever existed.

327
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,120
Look... There are a lot
of complicated issues

328
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,280
surrounding what the precise status
of all the U.S. territories should be

329
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,040
and what the people
who live there would prefer.

330
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,720
But surely, when it comes to denying
Americans the right to vote,

331
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,160
we have to find a better reason than
citing an 100-year-old legal decision

332
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,680
written by a racist that was always
supposed to be temporary.

333
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,440
And I'm not saying
this'll be an easy thing to do.

334
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,800
We've figured out a more complicated
things in the last 114 years.

335
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,920
Think about it: we invented television.
We eliminated the measles

336
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,320
and then, for some fucking reason,
brought them back again !

337
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,880
We've held 30 Wrestlemanias and
those things are logistical nightmares.

338
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,360
And you know what else we
figured out ? How to fucking fly !

339
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,680
And if we can work out
how to climb inside metal birds,

340
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,040
slip the bonds of this earth
and soar through the air

341
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,280
to visit these territories,
we should be able to work out

342
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,600
how to ensure the four million people
who live there get adequately heard.

343
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,200
And now this !

344
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,760
And now, Last Week Tonight
asks how is this still a thing ?

345
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,480
This week, daylight saving time.
How is this still a thing ?

346
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,240
If you're like most Americans,
you've been groggy all day

347
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,080
after losing an hour of sleep
to daylight saving.

348
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,040
And as you struggle to remember how
to change the clock on your microwave,

349
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,760
you may have wondered,
why is this happening ?

350
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,680
Conventional wisdom has been that
it benefits one particular group.

351
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,080
I know it started because of farmers,
I'm sure of that.

352
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,680
That's not true.

353
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,640
It gives an extra time to plan,
extra plan to harvest.

354
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,680
It has nothing to do with farmers.

355
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,480
I remember years ago, hearing
that it was for the farm people.

356
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:38,160
The farm people want nothing to do
with this, as they will tell you.

357
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,040
I know of really no farmer
that I'm aware of that benefits

358
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,200
from, you know, actually farm
activities at daylight savings time.

359
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,320
Of course daylight saving
doesn't benefit farms.

360
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,000
Cows don't care what time it is because
they're cows and cows are idiots.

361
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,560
So if it's not for them,
who is it for ?

362
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,840
The modern daylight saving was
introduced during the first World War,

363
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,120
as a fuel saving measure
by the Germans.

364
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,560
You lost an hour of sleep this morning
thanks to Kaiser Wilhelm.

365
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,080
And while, back then, daylight
saving may indeed have saved fuel,

366
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,200
in the modern era, energy consumption
is a little more complicated.

367
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:24,040
In fact, when Indiana adopted daylight
saving in 2006, guess what happened ?

368
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,240
The data shows that daylight
saving led to a 1% overall rise

369
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,000
in residential electricity.

370
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,360
Of course it did, because switching
on a lamp an hour later in the summer,

371
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,000
doesn't really matter when
you're blasting an air conditioners

372
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,560
and staying up all night,

373
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,320
scrolling through Instagrams
of your ex's honeymoon to Morocco.

374
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,160
That's not to say daylight saving
doesn't have any effects at all.

375
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,840
Studies show there is an increase of
car accidents and work-related injuries

376
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,800
the week after the time change.

377
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,240
What you lose in sleep,
you gain in mortal danger.

378
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,360
Despite all this,
70 countries around the world

379
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,440
still observe daylight saving

380
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,840
and yet by going by local news reports,
none of them could tell you why.

381
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,520
From Australia...

382
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,600
Daylight saving is almost over
before another year.

383
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,240
With it comes the usual debate
over its merits or lack-thereof.

384
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,360
To Italy...

385
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,080
It's a pain in the ass.

386
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,920
To even the Germans, the people
who started this whole mess.

387
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,800
The time change
for many people is ridiculous.

388
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,040
Whether it's an hour ahead
or later is complete nonsense.

389
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,200
Complete nonsense,
and that's coming from a country

390
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,240
that thinks this is a word
and that this is dancing.

391
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,440
So if it doesn't benefit
our energy bill, our health,

392
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,800
or our stupid, stupid cows,
it has to make you wonder,

393
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,520
daylight saving time,
how is this still a thing ?

394
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:02,160
And finally tonight, a quick
update on the tobacco industry.

395
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,600
A few weeks ago,
we looked at their efforts

396
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,920
to bully countries out
of adopting plain-packaging laws.

397
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,760
This week, to their credit, another
country was brave enough to try.

398
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,360
Ireland became
the first country in the E.U.,

399
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,600
the second in the world to introduce
plain packaging for tobacco products.

400
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,400
It is remarkable and all the more
so because tobacco companies

401
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,640
sent threatening letters
to the Irish government,

402
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,520
with an affiliate
of Philip Morris International

403
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,120
claiming the laws infringe
its trademarks saying, and I quote,

404
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,680
"As a dance is only
meaningful when danced,

405
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,240
so a trademark
is only meaningful when used."

406
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,920
And you know you have
a pretty weak legal argument

407
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,920
if it sounds like
a rejected fucking Jewel lyric.

408
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,920
When we talked about this,

409
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,040
we struck upon a compromise,
suggesting that Marlboro

410
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,040
should be allowed to put
branding on its packaging,

411
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,760
so long as that branding
was their new mascot,

412
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,280
Jeff the diseased lung
in a cowboy hat.

413
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,520
We even took out an ad
at a bus stop in Uruguay

414
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,840
and shipped a box
of Jeff tshirts to Togo.

415
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,840
We encouraged the rest of the world
to spread the word about Jeff

416
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,680
using the hashtag "jeffwecan."

417
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,960
And to our absolute joy,
Jeff you did.

418
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,120
Jeff you did very much.
But it didn't stop there.

419
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,280
Because, and we had nothing to do
with the rest of this,

420
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,040
there are now shockingly good
animated videos of Jeff on YouTube,

421
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:31,560
as well as this bus-stop ad in Germany,
featuring text which roughly translates

422
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,800
as, "break the tobacco industry."
Which is fantastic.

423
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,360
But, quick note: if you're going
to reference Kim Kardashian's

424
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,360
"break the internet" photo shoot,
you should make Jeff look like this.

425
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,040
They were both good it's just,
the point is, the point is,

426
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,040
it actually gets one step better,
'cause incredibly,

427
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,080
someone made
an elaborate full Jeff costume,

428
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,320
and sent us
a video from Mexico City

429
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,080
of him dancing
around onstage at a rally.

430
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,000
Gracias, Mexico. Muy bueno.

431
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,520
Should feel free to continue whatever
Jeff-based madness you see fit.

432
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,120
But by way of thanks, we wanted
to give something back to you.

433
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,120
In the words of the great poet
Philip Morris International,

434
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,880
"a dance is only meaningful
if it is danced."

435
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,440
So please now welcome Jeff
and the diseased lung line dancers

436
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,480
to perform the soon-to-be
international dance craze, "the Jeff".

437
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,040
Okay, that's our show, everybody !
Good night !

438
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,800
Thank you for joining us.
We'll see you again next week.

439
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,560
Jeff, are you okay ?
Are you okay Jeff ? Goodbye !

440
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,960
END OF EPISODE 5,
SEASON II
