00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,280
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight" !

2
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,400
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

3
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,120
And we begin tonight with a story
that has dominated the news all week,

4
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,600
the horrific terror attacks in France.

5
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,640
Now, one of the big developments of
this week was that the ringleader

6
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,280
Abdelhamid Abaaoud
was killed on Wednesday,

7
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,960
and his death was welcomed
by pretty much everyone.

8
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,320
"The New York Times" reports

9
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,480
when his family heard that he'd
possibly been killed last year,

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,560
Abaaoud's own sister said,
they prayed he was dead.

11
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,920
Holy shit.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,040
Even his own family
had prayed for his death,

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,840
which is absolutely
understandable,

14
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,240
but it's also the darkest
tale of a family's homicidal tendencies

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,640
towards one of their own
since the "Home Alone" movies.

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,040
Yeah. You really think the McCallisters
left Kevin behind by accident twice ?

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,840
No, they wanted that little shit
out of the picture.

18
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,520
Open your eyes.
The McCallisters were murderers.

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,520
#mccalistersmcmurderers.

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,520
Now as for the people
of France themselves,

21
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,120
they have spent the week trying to
resume something resembling daily life,

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,360
an effort led by their president
Francois Hollande.

23
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,400
Life must resume in full.

24
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,400
What would our country be
without its cafÃ©s,

25
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,440
concerts, sporting events
and museums ?

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,280
I'll tell you what France would be like
without these cultural institutions.

27
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,080
It would be Luxembourg,
and nobody wants that.

28
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,000
Did you know that if you Google
"interesting Luxembourg facts,"

29
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,560
the result is
just a page that says, "No" ?

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,240
Now, to their credit,

31
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,440
many French people have embraced
this idea of returning to normal life.

32
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,560
And I think
the most reassuring sign

33
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,640
that they're getting back to being
their quintessential selves

34
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,960
was how they behaved at a concert just
a few days after the attacks,

35
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,080
when someone tried to stage-dive.

36
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,520
There is the Paris
we know and love,

37
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,240
a city of people so aloof,

38
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,640
they wouldn't lift a finger to catch
one of their own airborne pop stars.

39
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,440
"I do not care for,
how you say ?

40
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,560
"Crowd surfing.

41
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,680
"Such a crass spectaclebetrays nothing
but a poverty of intimacy, non ?

42
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,880
Beauf."

43
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,680
A French TV show actually
took that video out

44
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,360
and showed it to people in the street,
and their response was fantastic.

45
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,920
You know, to me, that is the best sign
that France is going to be okay.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,400
It's how New Yorkers knew this city
was going to bounce back after 9/11

47
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,640
the first time a heavyset man
in a Jets visor stole a cab from them

48
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,000
and told them to go
fuck themselves.

49
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,280
That is what healing
looks like.

50
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,720
Meanwhile, here in the US,

51
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,720
the Paris attackers touched off a
ferocious debate about Syrian refugees.

52
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,360
President Obama had pledged to accept
at least 10,000 over the next year,

53
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,640
but after news broke

54
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,880
that one of the attackers may have
posed as a refugee and entered Europe

55
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,120
through Greece
with a fake Syrian passport,

56
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,560
many US officials
had second thoughts.

57
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,920
31 governors now oppose,
are refusing or suspending

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,720
the resettlement of Syrian
refugees into their states.

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,080
Okay, that's pretty extreme,

60
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,240
but it's also pretty meaningless
for two reasons:

61
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,280
One, governors don't have
the legal authority to ban refugees.

62
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,840
And two, even if they could, Syrians
can just walk between states

63
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,520
like anyone else.

64
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,600
The lines on maps are not
crocodile-filled moats.

65
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,240
Presidential candidates got involved
with this anti-refugee rhetoric.

66
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,560
Donald Trump, Ben Carson
and Marco Rubio

67
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,800
called for a halt to all Syrian
refugees entering the country,

68
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,560
and others, like Ted Cruz
and Jeb Bush,

69
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,040
argued we could take some
if they were Christian.

70
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,160
And if you're wondering how that would
work, let Jeb Bush explain.

71
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,560
What does the focus on Christian
families actually look like ?

72
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,360
Well, you're Christian. You can
prove you're a Christian.

73
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,360
- How ?
- I think you can prove it.

74
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,040
I think you can prove it.
I'm pretty sure you can prove it.

75
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,760
I'll tell you how. A Christian has ears
that protrude out from the head,

76
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,840
whereas non-Christians
lack external ears altogether.

77
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,080
Hold on.
I'm thinking about seals and sea lions.

78
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,880
I get them confused. Forget what I said
about Christians and Muslims.

79
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,720
I don't know what I'm talking about.

80
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,560
And it was not just Republicans.

81
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,680
The Democratic mayor of
Roanoke, Virginia, David Bowers,

82
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,920
was so terrified of Syrian refugees,

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,680
he used the worst possible
historical example to prove his point.

84
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,760
Mayor David Bowers wrote, "I'm reminded
President Roosevelt felt compelled

85
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,400
"to sequester Japanese foreign
nationals after Pearl Harbor.

86
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,160
"It appears the threat of harm
to America from ISIS now

87
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,840
"is just as real and serious
as that from our enemies then."

88
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,480
Wow. Did he not realize that
Japanese internment camps

89
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,400
are one of this nation's
greatest sources of shame ?

90
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,600
It's one of the parts of his legacy his
family would most like you to forget.

91
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,640
And bear in mind,
this is a man whose own biopic

92
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,600
featured a scene of him getting
a hand job from his distant cousin.

93
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,400
Did I have to show you that ? No.

94
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,520
Did I want to ?
Absolutely, I did.

95
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,120
But this week's events call to mind
a chapter from FDR's time in office

96
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,320
that is even more shameful than
the saddest and classiest hand job,

97
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,720
specifically, when in 1939
US authorities turned away a ship

98
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,520
containing more than 900 mostly Jewish
refugees from Germany,

99
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,640
something American newsreels at the
time tried to put a positive spin on.

100
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,400
907 Jewish unfortunates without
a country permitted to land in Belgium

101
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,240
after five weeks
of suspense afloat.

102
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,560
Through American generosity, they will
find at least temporary shelter

103
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,400
in France, Holland,
and England.

104
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,360
Yes, we sent a boat of Jews
back to Europe in 1939.

105
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,760
More than a quarter of them
then died in the war.

106
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,520
So this Thanksgiving,
when your grandmother's complaining

107
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,280
about your new piercings, saying
your generation is terrible,

108
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,520
simply reply, "Nana, at least we didn't
send Jews back to Europe in 1939."

109
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,040
Then break off a turkey leg,
drop it like a microphone,

110
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,560
and you've just won
the dinner. Dinner over.

111
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,080
Although, let's be honest here,

112
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,280
every generation has had
its own ugly reaction to refugees,

113
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,080
whether they are the Irish, the
Vietnamese, the Cubans or the Haitians.

114
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,920
And those fears have been
broadly unfounded.

115
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,320
In fact, there was only one time
in American history

116
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,440
when the fear of refugees wiping
everyone out did actually come true,

117
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,200
and we'll all be sitting around
the table celebrating it on Thursday.

118
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,240
And look, it is absolutely fair...

119
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,480
It's fair to be concerned about safety
in the wake of these attacks.

120
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,840
And it's fair to wonder
who we're letting in

121
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,240
and what sort of screening system
is in place.

122
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,600
Unfortunately, many of the people
talking about it this week

123
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,680
don't seem to have the first idea
of what we're doing.

124
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,760
Do we know
who these people are ? No.

125
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,120
Are they properly vetted ?
No.

126
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,840
How do you vet them ?
There's no possible way to vet them.

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,600
There's virtually no vetting,
'cause there are no databases in Syria.

128
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,120
There are no government records.
We don't know who these people are.

129
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,680
Look, it is difficult to vet people
coming out of a war zone,

130
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,400
but it's not like we're just letting
anyone in. We are the USA,

131
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,080
not Arizona State.

132
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,960
Because,
just for the record here,

133
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,960
let me walk you through
what our screening process actually is.

134
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,200
If you're a refugee,
first you apply

135
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,840
through the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees,

136
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,000
which collects documents
and performs interviews.

137
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,400
Incidentally, less than
one percent of refugees worldwide

138
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,080
end up being recommended
for resettlement.

139
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,560
But if you're one of them,
you may then be referred

140
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,200
to the State Department,
to begin the vetting process.

141
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,960
More information is collected. You'll
be put through security screenings

142
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,320
by the National
Counterterrorism Center,

143
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,640
the FBI, and the Department
of Homeland Security.

144
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,680
And if you're a Syrian refugee, you'll
get an additional layer of screening

145
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,640
called the Syria Enhanced Review,

146
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,080
which may include a further check
by a special part of Homeland Security,

147
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,320
the USCIS Fraud Detection
and National Security Directorate.

148
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,640
And don't relax yet, 'cause
we've barely even started.

149
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,360
Then you finally get
an interview with USCIS officers

150
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,880
and you'll also be fingerprinted,

151
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,960
so your prints can be run through
the biometric databases of the FBI,

152
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,480
the Department of Homeland Security,
and the Department of Defense.

153
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,200
And if you make it through all that,
you'll then have health screenings,

154
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,680
which, let's face it,
may not go too well for you,

155
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,080
as you may have given yourself a stroke
getting through this process so far.

156
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,320
But if everything comes back clear,
you'll be enrolled in cultural classes,

157
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,520
all while your information continues to
be checked against terrorist databases

158
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,840
to make sure that no new information
comes in that wasn't caught before.

159
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,120
All of that has to happen
before you get near a plane.

160
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,040
This process typically
takes 18 to 24 months

161
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,280
once you've been referred
by the UN to the United States.

162
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,480
This is the most rigorous vetting

163
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,600
anyone has to face
before entering this country.

164
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,360
No terrorist in their right mind
would choose this path

165
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,960
when the visa process
requires far less effort.

166
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,680
But nevertheless, the House
still voted on Thursday

167
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,520
to add a few more steps.

168
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,680
The House voted 289 to 137
for tougher screening procedures,

169
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,040
requiring the FBI director to sign off
on each and every refugee.

170
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,920
He signs off on...
That is ridiculous.

171
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,480
At this point, why don't we just
include a pie eating contest,

172
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,080
a spelling bee
and an evening wear portion ?

173
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,520
But the really hard truth here is

174
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,840
no one can promise that someone
dangerous still might not slip through.

175
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,520
While that risk should not be denied,
it also should not be wildly inflated.

176
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,120
Let me ask this. If you bought
a five-pound bag of peanuts,

177
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,720
and you knew that in
the five-pound bag of peanuts,

178
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,840
there were about 10 peanuts
that were deadly poisonous,

179
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,120
would you feed them to your kids ?
The answer is no.

180
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,960
Yeah, of course it's no.

181
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,440
You should give your kids an actual
meal, not a handful of peanuts,

182
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,720
because they're human children,
not circus elephants. But second,

183
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,960
we wanted to do the math
on what he just said,

184
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,760
so we bought five pounds of peanuts
and we counted them.

185
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,000
There are about
1,000 nuts in there.

186
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,080
So if 10 of them are poisoned,
Mike Huckabee is essentially suggesting

187
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,800
that about one of every 100 refugees
is a terrorist.

188
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,720
But in reality, of the more than
784,000 refugees

189
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,920
admitted to the US since 9/11,

190
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,480
only three have been arrested for
planning terrorist activities,

191
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,040
none of which, by the way,
resulted in attacks here.

192
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,640
So the actual known ratio
of arrested terror suspects to refugees

193
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,640
is not one in 100.
It's one in roughly 261,000.

194
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,280
Peanuts themselves have killed
far more people in the last decade

195
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,080
than terrorist refugees.

196
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,000
I'll go one step further.

197
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,440
Men named Mike have killed more people
than terrorist refugees.

198
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,320
And I don't see us
rounding all of them up.

199
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,840
And that's kind of the point, 'cause,
as reasonable adults, we accept

200
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,400
tiny amounts of risk
baked into our everyday lives.

201
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,720
We drive cars despite knowing around
30,000 of us die in them each year.

202
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,760
We go swimming despite the fact
10 people a day die from drowning.

203
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,200
20 Americans every year
are killed by cows,

204
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,360
but no one is saying we should expel
all cows from the country.

205
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,280
We're happy just taking them out
one at a time, thinking,

206
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,640
"Well, we got them
before they got us."

207
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,480
This is what freedom tastes like.

208
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,200
Any rational person knows,
you cannot completely eliminate risk.

209
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,800
You can only manage it. We do it with
peanuts, cars, swimming and hamburgers,

210
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,960
and men named Mike, 'cause we rightly
think that they're worth the risk.

211
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,160
I would argue, for the tremendous good
we could do and the low level of risk,

212
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,920
refugees are worth it too.
And you may disagree,

213
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,520
but it is worth noting, as we devise
new ways to close our doors this week,

214
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,240
France, which had just
suffered a terror attack

215
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,720
and has far less ability
to police its borders, did this.

216
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,480
French President says France will still
welcome refugees into the country

217
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,440
despite the Paris massacre. Speaking at
a gathering of the nation's mayors,

218
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,520
he said France will keep
its commitment

219
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,640
to take in 30,000 refugees
over the next two years.

220
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,120
Hollande added that France will remain
a country of freedom.

221
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,280
Yeah, because they think
it's worth the risk.

222
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,280
And it's frankly not ideal
that Francois Hollande,

223
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,120
a man who broke up
with his partner of 30 years

224
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,800
to shack up with a lover who looks
exactly like her, 10 years younger,

225
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,320
only to quickly leave
that lover for another lover

226
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,640
who looks exactly like the second
lover, just 10 years younger again,

227
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,600
that man is currently functioning

228
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,240
as an effective moral compass
for our politicians.

229
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,360
And now this.

230
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:52,280
And now, the dismal prop comedy
of the US Congress.

231
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,920
Here you have a little
condiment package.

232
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,680
Here you have a bun
with a... something in between.

233
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,200
And then you have a half of fruit
over on the other side.

234
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,280
This administration has been
dangerously incompetent

235
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,160
in providing homeland security.

236
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,600
I have a couple of shots here
from this very same well,

237
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,400
where I gave
a very similar speech.

238
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,040
"Don't tax me to pay for
health care that you guys want."

239
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,720
Geraldo Rivera and Ted Koppel.

240
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,480
A large, orange,
slovenly, lazy cat.

241
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,600
Justin Bieber
and Selena Gomez.

242
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,920
Steak, vodka.

243
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,320
President Ronald Reagan.

244
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,920
We have Christmastime
and we have socks.

245
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,360
It's a snowball.

246
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,600
It's a catfish.

247
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,840
US jobs.
This is the Pac-Man.

248
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,160
Chicken noodle soup.

249
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,960
Moving on...

250
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,760
Just so you know,
this is our final show of the year.

251
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,880
And after all the big, intractable
topics we've taken on this season,

252
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,720
we thought it might be nice to go out
on a problem that's not just tidy

253
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,960
but also totally fixable.

254
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,640
The penny,
once again on the cover

255
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,280
of this month's
"Infant Swallowables" magazine.

256
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,840
The US Mint produces around eight
billion new pennies every single year,

257
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,120
which is strange, considering pennies
are currently worth so little,

258
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,680
they're not even worth
what they're worth.

259
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,280
According to the government, each new
penny now costs 1.7 cents to make,

260
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,760
rendering each a loss
from the start.

261
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,960
It's true.
1.7 cents to make one cent.

262
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,160
That really makes the phrase, "You have
to spend money to make money,"

263
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,800
ring painfully true.

264
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,160
So we spend around
$136 million a year

265
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,760
making $80 million worth of currency
that, let's face it, no one uses.

266
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,320
One study found that two-thirds of
pennies don't circulate.

267
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,800
And yet the penny
hangs around for no reason,

268
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,840
like the appendix
or the new "Muppets" TV show.

269
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,640
How is this still on ? And how did
someone somewhere think,

270
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,720
"You know what the problem with this
is ? Kermit doesn't fuck enough pigs.

271
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,400
"Let's have him fuck a different pig.
Let's do that. Let's all do that."

272
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,640
In fact, a few years back,
a local station in New York

273
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,320
sent out a camera crew
to put the penny to the test.

274
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,600
I performed a little experiment
on the street today.

275
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,360
I dumped 150 pennies
onto the sidewalk and just watched.

276
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,800
Who would pick them up ?

277
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,840
People saw the pennies,
like this woman, but kept walking.

278
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,920
After 25 minutes,
not one person bent down.

279
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,080
Think about that.
A penny is actual US currency,

280
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,960
and yet the prospect of the free one
on the ground is treated like

281
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,240
a free copy of Kirstie Alley's
memoir resting in a used diaper.

282
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,120
And if you're thinking, "John, that's
just one instance," no, it's not.

283
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,560
A few years later, a San Francisco news
crew ran the exact same experiment.

284
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,920
It's your lucky day. Abe Lincoln,
face-up on the sidewalk.

285
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,680
Better move quick.
He'll be gone any second, right ?

286
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,400
- You don't want them ?
- No.

287
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,440
What ?

288
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,760
Throwing pennies on the ground
is catnip to local news crews.

289
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,640
"Hey, did an old woman
celebrate a birthday ?" "No."

290
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,720
"Okay, did an animal
do something funny ?" "No."

291
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,680
"Okay, get me a handful
of pennies and a camera.

292
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,240
"I'm getting us to the 10:30
repeat of 'Friends.'

293
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,800
Who wants a penny ?"

294
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,720
But our indifference to pennies doesn't
stop there. In a 2002 Gallup poll

295
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,680
two percent of Americans admitted to
throwing pennies in the garbage,

296
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,560
which means the US Mint
is spending millions to make garbage.

297
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,480
And that's not their job.
That's M. Night Shyamalan's job.

298
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,040
And when we're not
throwing pennies in the garbage,

299
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,080
we're doing even
worse things with them,

300
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,280
as attested to
by a Reddit thread titled

301
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,640
"I put a penny in my butt
and now I can't get it out."

302
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,160
And, before you ask, apparently the
reason they did it was, and I quote,

303
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,960
"I wanted to know what it would feel
like to put a cold penny up my butt.

304
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,080
(I put it in the fridge
for like... 2-3 hours.)"

305
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,160
First, a little-known fact.

306
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,200
That's actually how Daniel Day Lewis
prepared to play Abraham Lincoln.

307
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,240
And incidentally,
and this is also true,

308
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,280
that penny is currently
in your pocket.

309
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,160
And it's not just hard
to carry pennies around.

310
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,440
It can be hard to spend them.
According to the Treasury Department,

311
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,360
private businesses are free
to prohibit payment in pennies.

312
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,520
And some of them
have caught on to this.

313
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,320
At a growing number of businesses,

314
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,400
including Mike's Bikes in San Rafael,
pennies have fallen from favor.

315
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,000
Now at Mike's, every cash transaction

316
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,920
rounds down to the nearest nickel
in a customer's favor.

317
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,760
Their reaction has been
overwhelmingly underwhelming.

318
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,800
Whatever is easier.
I don't care. Am I helping ?

319
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,280
I'm pretty sure.

320
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,920
We found the man who gives the least
amount of shits in American history.

321
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,360
Someone out there needs to meme
this beautiful man, and do it now.

322
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,240
In fact,
as far as I can tell,

323
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,000
there are only two things
pennies are genuinely good for.

324
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,320
One, you can throw a penny
in a fountain to make a wish.

325
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,840
But at its current value,
no fountain is granting you a wish,

326
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,960
unless it's incredibly small, like

327
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,240
"I wish somewhere in the world
a mouse has a good day,"

328
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,680
or, "I wish I knew what a penny
looked like underwater."

329
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,960
The only other option is
use pennies out of pure spite,

330
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,360
like this UNC-Charlotte student
did with a parking fine.

331
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:30,720
Coyle went to three different banks to
get five $25 boxes with 2500 pennies.

332
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,120
That got him to reach
his total of 11,000.

333
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,200
And I brought them in three
separate buckets for them.

334
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,120
He sat there while two workers
counted every single penny.

335
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,360
It took them approximately
three hours and 40 minutes.

336
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,040
Wow, that college kid
sure taught those two employees

337
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,560
who had nothing to do with the policy
he was protesting a lesson.

338
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,560
I bet the school gave him
his own parking spot after that.

339
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,840
And it is worth noting,
pennies don't just waste our time.

340
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,360
Having them hanging around
can sometimes be downright dangerous.

341
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,360
Jack is a voracious eater,
says his owner Tim Kelleher.

342
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,120
He jumped up on the desk trying to get
something, he chewed through the bag

343
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,400
and knocked the box over
and pennies were everywhere.

344
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,240
And he licked up the pennies
and he licked up 111 of them.

345
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,640
Holy shit.
111 pennies.

346
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,360
At that point, that dog had more
Lincoln in him than Mary Todd.

347
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,200
And by the way,
and this is also true,

348
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,840
one of the pennies inside that dog is
in your pocket right now.

349
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,800
So why haven't
we gotten rid of the penny ?

350
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,960
One reason, believe it or not, is
that there is a penny lobby.

351
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,520
And at the forefront is
a terribly named group called

352
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,280
"Americans for Common Cents,"

353
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,000
whose spokesman has some
pretty unconvincing arguments.

354
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,600
Americans overwhelmingly
want to keep the penny.

355
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,720
And no one has explained
how we would replace

356
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,680
the millions of dollars
that are raised by charities

357
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,240
and charity drives every year
if we didn't have the penny around.

358
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,560
Wait, so his argument is
no one would give to charity

359
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,880
if they couldn't give something
basically worthless,

360
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,640
which is a pretty cynical
view of humanity.

361
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,920
I'll be honest,
I don't think much of people,

362
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,720
but even I have to believe they'd be
willing to break out a fucking nickel.

363
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,800
And you might want to take his argument
with a grain of salt,

364
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,440
given his group's backers.

365
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,000
Weller is a lobbyist
for Jarden Zinc,

366
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,440
the Tennessee company
that sells those little blank discs

367
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,040
for the Mint to turn
into Lincoln pennies.

368
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,400
So they're in the pocket
of Big Zinc.

369
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,520
If not for the penny, what are they
supposed to do with all those discs ?

370
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,200
Hold a mini Olympic discus throwing
competition starring hamsters ?

371
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,760
Yes, that's clearly
exactly what they should do.

372
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,040
But even that zinc company doesn't seem
to care that much about pennies.

373
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,840
So far this year, they've only spent
around $140,000 lobbying on it,

374
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,480
which isn't much,
considering that Jarden Corporation,

375
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,920
their parent company,
is a $10-billion business.

376
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,360
The penny contract
is nothing to them,

377
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,200
next to the money that they make from
products like, and this is true,

378
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,200
Yankee Candle,
Crock-Pots, and class rings.

379
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:19,240
Jarden makes anything that you would
find left behind after a burglary.

380
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,040
But there is actually one more staunch
defender of the penny,

381
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,800
Lincoln enthusiasts.

382
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,560
As the Lincoln Library told us,
they'll fight for the Lincoln penny

383
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,240
right down to the last cent.

384
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,360
Yeah, but why ? Lincoln doesn't need
the penny for notoriety.

385
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,560
He's everywhere. We've put him on
novelty bandages,

386
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,800
cup-and-ball games
and creepy Chia pets.

387
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,640
And you know where else
we put him ? The five-dollar bill!

388
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,680
You know, the thing that's worth
500 times more than the penny.

389
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,160
And if you're thinking, "We could make
the penny out of something cheaper,"

390
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,440
we can't. The US Mint admitted "there
are no alternative metal compositions

391
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,880
that reduce the manufacturing cost of
the penny below its face value."

392
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,920
Essentially, there is no cheaper way
to make a penny,

393
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,720
'cause there is no other substance
that is so worthless

394
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,400
without making them out of
DVDs of "The Cosby Show."

395
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,320
And we don't want to...

396
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,880
We don't want to do that.
We don't want to do that.

397
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,080
And if we wanted to get rid of
the penny, we could do it.

398
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,880
Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand
and many others have all done so.

399
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,600
It wouldn't even be the first time
the US got rid of a coin.

400
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,800
We used to have a halfpenny,
and guess when we got rid of it.

401
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,120
The halfpenny was dropped
at 1857,

402
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,320
because inflation had rendered
its buying power obsolete.

403
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,960
They knew it didn't make sense
to keep a currency that had no value,

404
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,760
and that was back in 1857,

405
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,600
when people were scared of the moon
and wiped their asses with rocks.

406
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,880
So come on,
let's dump the penny,

407
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,000
not 'cause we need to, not 'cause
it will change a great deal,

408
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,000
but because there are certain things
we know are impossible to get rid of,

409
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,040
terrorism, herpes
and Guy Fieri.

410
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,240
But the penny is a nuisance
we could actually do something about.

411
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,040
So let's do it, America. Let's get
the penny out of our pockets,

412
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,920
out of our dogs, out of our fridges
and out of our asses.

413
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,360
We can do this !

414
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,080
And now this.

415
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:29,080
And now, what in God's name
are they covering on WCBS News at 11 ?

416
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,280
"Shock Yourself Happy,"
tonight on CBS2 News at 11:00.

417
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,400
"Barcode Bandits,"
tonight at 11:00.

418
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,000
"Women are Shaving Their Faces,"
tonight at 11:00.

419
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,200
"New Age Networking.
The Kava Craze."

420
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,280
"Secret Lives of Suburban Wives."

421
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,440
"Mirrored Pain."
"Virtual Kidnapping."

422
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,120
"The ATM Panic Button."
"Shaming Your Name."

423
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,040
"The Anger Room,"
tonight at 11:00.

424
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,240
"Scalp Botox,"
tonight at 11:00.

425
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,480
"The Vampire Facial,"
tonight at 11:00.

426
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,680
"Younger Hands,"

427
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,280
"Viagra for Kids,"
tonight at 11:00.

428
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,760
"Long Distance Chicken,"
tonight on CBS2 News at 11:00.

429
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,400
And finally tonight,
this is our final show of the year

430
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,760
and we just wanted to take a moment to
say thank you so much for watching.

431
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,520
We've had such a fun year.
And we made a sex ed video.

432
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,760
We created mascots
for government agencies.

433
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,200
Dueted with both Kenny G
and Michael Bolton.

434
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,760
I sat down
with Edward Snowden

435
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,480
in the most terrifying
48-hour trip of my entire life.

436
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,760
We replaced the Marlboro Man

437
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,680
with Jeff the Diseased Lung
in a Cowboy Hat.

438
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,280
And we managed to get him
onto billboards in Uruguay,

439
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,760
T-shirts in Togo,
and, thanks to you,

440
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,680
a top spot when you Google image search
"Marlboro" on the Internet.

441
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,200
I can only imagine
they're so pleased with that.

442
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,640
We got into a spat
with the president of Ecuador

443
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,360
who called this show
"more unpleasant than a diuretic,"

444
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,320
as well as with former
FIFA vice president Jack Warner,

445
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,480
which culminated in us buying time
on Trinidadian television

446
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,520
and nearly setting fire to the set.

447
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,480
You have no idea how true that is.

448
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:11,320
I also drank a whole Bud Light Lime
to celebrate Sepp Blatter's downfall,

449
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,840
which, for the record,
tasted like unflushed toilet water

450
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,320
after margarita night
at a frat house.

451
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,600
Oh, and I nearly forgot.
We founded a church!

452
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,800
A church.

453
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,000
Our Lady
of Perpetual Exemption,

454
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,640
which raised nearly $70,000
and five cups of human sperm.

455
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,200
Praise be. Praise be.
Praise be unto sperm.

456
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,840
It has been quite a year, so
thank you so much for watching.

457
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,320
And what more disgusting
way to say goodbye

458
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,400
than by sipping on a room-temperature
Bud Light Lime ? Cheers.

459
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,000
Repellent. It takes like a lacrosse
player's night sweats.

460
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,520
There are so many people
I have to thank.

461
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,400
First, I have to thank my wife,
specifically, Wanda Jo Oliver.

462
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,520
Wanda Jo, my darling,
thank you so much for being here.

463
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,120
Wanda Jo, since the church
has disbanded, how have you been ?

464
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,640
Oh, my John, I have been
deep in prayer with our accountants,

465
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,360
studying the scriptures
of US tax codes.

466
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,360
- Praise loopholes.
- Praise them. Praise unto loopholes.

467
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,920
Praise unto them,
Wanda Jo.

468
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,680
Yes, and praise
the holy relics of our church...

469
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,880
Specifically, this...

470
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,480
...three-foot wooden penis
and this bag of seed. Praise seed !

471
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,480
- Praise it. Praise it.
- Praise seed.

472
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,080
Now, Wanda... Wanda, I have to ask,
just for the record...

473
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:39,000
We took people's money after making
them unsubstantiated promises

474
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,440
about wealth coming their way.

475
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,040
Did we get into any trouble
whatsoever for that ?

476
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,880
Well, my John,
does this answer your question ?

477
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,560
It answers it pretty good.

478
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,360
Praise be.
I'm gonna make it rain.

479
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,880
- Make it rain.
- Thank you so much, my darling Wanda.

480
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,680
I would like to thank
our entire staff and crew,

481
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,880
including, of course,
Janice from accounting,

482
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,200
who has worked hard,
so hard all year.

483
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,320
Janice, have you had fun
this year ?

484
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,880
Ouch. Okay. Is that my favorite
coffee cup, Janice ?

485
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,320
Wow, Janice don't give a fuck.

486
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,240
Oh, and before we leave, someone else
wanted to say goodbye.

487
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,240
It's Jeff the Diseased Lung
in a Cowboy Hat.

488
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,360
How are you doing, Jeff ?

489
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,280
Jeff's not doing well. In fact,
he's doing objectively terribly.

490
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,400
And now, to play us out
for the year,

491
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,640
