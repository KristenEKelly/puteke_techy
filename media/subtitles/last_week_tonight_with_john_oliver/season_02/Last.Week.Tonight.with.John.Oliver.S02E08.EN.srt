00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,960
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,360
Season II, episode 8

3
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,640
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,520
A longer edition tonight
for reasons that will become clear,

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,360
but just time
for a quick recap of the week.

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,400
And we begin tonight with Iran.
The greatest threat to Salman Rushdie

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,840
since Padma Lakshmi's
divorce attorney.

8
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,960
The world's attention was focused on
the Iranian nuclear talks,

9
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,720
taking place in Switzerland.

10
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,080
We only had tantalizing glimpses
of some of the main players.

11
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,440
I want to show you some BuzzFeed
video of John Kerry taking a walk.

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,560
This is the first time we've seen
the Secretary of State in a long time,

13
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,080
he's across the street there
from the hotel getting some air.

14
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,920
Tourists here chanting
"I love you, John Kerry".

15
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,760
Wait, "I love you John Kerry" ?

16
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,000
No lucid human
has ever said those words.

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,000
Even his wife has has at most,
said:

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,920
"certain aspects of your personality
are not displeasing, John."

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,360
That's as far as anyone
can physically go.

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,720
Talks extended well past
their initial deadline,

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,200
hardly surprising, given that they took
place in the Hotel Beau Rivage palace.

22
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,440
And if you think it looks spectacular
from the outside,

23
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,840
wait till you see
their promotional video.

24
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,800
Welcome
to the Hotel Beau Rivage Palace.

25
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,320
This 15 000 square foot spa is
the first of its kind in Switzerland.

26
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,720
The hotel's restaurants include
Anne-Sophie Pic of Beau Rivage.

27
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,600
The 169 elegant rooms
and sumptuous suites are spacious,

28
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,920
elegant
and exquisitely appointed.

29
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,760
I'm just going to say it: I want
to have sex with that hotel.

30
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,120
Not in that hotel. With it.
I want to fuck that hotel.

31
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,600
Why would any diplomat rush
to close a deal in that place ?

32
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,600
We went on their website
and found that they offer

33
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,080
not just Japanese bath treatments
but also, a hotel bar show

34
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,440
featuring funk rock band
"The Inglorious Fonkers".

35
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,480
I'm sorry, you hadn't heard
of the Inglorious Fonkers ?

36
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,480
Prepare to have
that changed forever.

37
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,240
Have you heard
about a crazy band ?

38
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,560
Listen to the Fonkers.
I'm sure you'll be amazed.

39
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,760
I said, "free".

40
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,240
That is the quintessential sound
and look of Swiss hotel funk.

41
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,600
Despite all the hotel's attractions,
Thursday brought a huge announcement.

42
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,120
Today, nearly round the clock
negotiations with Iran

43
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,200
and how to curb its nuclear program
produced a framework of a deal.

44
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,680
Now if this holds, that is
a massive achievement.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,320
And the very next day, Iranians
proved how excited they were.

46
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,640
After marathon negotiations,

47
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,480
Iran's foreign minister Javad Zarif
arrived home a hero,

48
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,800
especially among the young
who hope

49
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,120
the nuclear deal will bring
their country in from the cold.

50
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,720
At Friday prayers, there was
the usual chant of "death to America"

51
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,600
but more habit than conviction.

52
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,960
That's good I guess.
More habit than conviction.

53
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,560
Like an atheist saying
"God bless you" when you sneeze,

54
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,600
or Billy Joel
singing "Piano Man".

55
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,720
You know that song is just
mouth-noises to him at this point.

56
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:59,000
I should point out that this deal
is not technically a deal yet.

57
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,960
Our work is not yet done.
The deal has not been signed.

58
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,640
Between now and the end of June,
the negotiators will work

59
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,360
through the details of how this
framework will be implemented

60
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,680
and details matter.

61
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,840
That won't be easy. Think of how
incredible it'll be if they do it.

62
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,280
They're at
the Hotel Beau Rivage palace.

63
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,200
They've signed a historic deal.
It's May the seventh.

64
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,560
And drifting up from
the hotel bar is this sound.

65
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,320
We have peace.
Peace in our fonking time.

66
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,760
Moving on to Nigeria. The country
whose prince is going to be sending you

67
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,920
some ofthat money
he owes any day now.

68
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,200
After weeks of delay
due to Boko Haram,

69
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,200
Nigeria finally held their election.

70
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,360
Nigeria has a new president.

71
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,920
Retired general Muhammadu Buhari
defeating incumbent Goodluck Jonathan.

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,680
Jonathan issued a statement
thanking Nigerians

73
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,200
for "great opportunity
to lead the country."

74
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,960
Thanking people for the great
opportunity is a weird tone.

75
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,640
Sounds more like a temp

76
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,640
leaving after covering
someone's maternity leave.

77
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,840
Keep my resume on file in case
Linda gets pregnant again.

78
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,120
Now: who here
can tell me my name ?

79
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,560
Goodluck Jonathan leaves
behind a mixed legacy.

80
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,120
But the very fact he conceded is
actually a major step forward

81
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,640
for Nigerian democracy.

82
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,160
This election was something
of a milestone.

83
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,880
This was the first real
contest in Nigeria's history,

84
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,800
which is riddled with coups
and rigged elections.

85
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,960
But with a truly independent
electoral commission

86
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,200
and the introduction
of electronic voter registration,

87
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,880
a lid was kept on fraud and the
power of the people won through.

88
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,560
That's absolutely fantastic.

89
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,160
Whilst they've had supposedly
democratic elections before,

90
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,800
and they did look a lot like
the real thing, they weren't quite it.

91
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,520
Much like imitation crab
or Dave Franco.

92
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,600
Not quite
what you were promised.

93
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,120
Nigeria's new leader
will be Muhammadu Buhari.

94
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,000
We have some inkling
of how he may be as a leader,

95
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,680
because he's done it before.

96
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,440
After Buhari last took power
in a coup in 1983,

97
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,360
he brutally attacked corruption,
setting up military tribunals,

98
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,920
executing drug dealers publicly
and punishing bureaucrats

99
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,120
who arrived late for work,
forcing them to do squats.

100
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,640
That's true.

101
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,720
His government forced civil servants
to do squat jumps as punishment.

102
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,160
Something that looks like this.
In the past,

103
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,280
he's basically been the military
dictator version of Jillian Michaels.

104
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,760
Bend your fucking knees or
I'll break them with this pole.

105
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,000
You're not acting strong,
you're acting pathetic.

106
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:04,000
Get the fuck up. Unless you faint,
puke or die, keep walking.

107
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,040
Ok, I take it back.

108
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,240
The military dictator version of
Jillian Michaels is Jillian Michaels.

109
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,120
But finally this week:
President Obama.

110
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,880
America's forty-fourth
"not my president".

111
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,080
He's selling jobs initiatives
on the road

112
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,520
and this week
he landed in unfriendly territory.

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,400
President Obama is heading
to deep red Utah.

114
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,360
A state in which he only managed
to get 25% of the vote back in 2012.

115
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,680
Only 25 percent ? It cannot be
easy to go back somewhere

116
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,800
when three quarters of the people
don't care for you,

117
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,800
which is why I spend
most of my time in this country.

118
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,080
That's a hard fact.

119
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,720
This was actually his first
trip to Utah as president.

120
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,000
Which drew people's attention
to an insulting fact.

121
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,360
He's hit 49 of the 50 states
as president.

122
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,640
The only one missing,
South Dakota.

123
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,400
Yes, much like Uber and sweatshirts
without glitter on them,

124
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,200
the president has not
yet made it to South Dakota.

125
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,680
It's not like the people
who live there have not noticed.

126
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,360
It's official.
South Dakota will become

127
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,360
the only state without
a visit from President Obama.

128
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,400
South Dakota is the only state Obama
has not visited since taking office.

129
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,320
- He's saving the best for last.
- Exactly, right ?

130
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,120
Obama came close when he was
on the standing rock reservation.

131
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,840
Part of the reservation extends into
South Dakota but Obama stayed north.

132
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,440
He was in the neighborhood
and he didn't drop by ?

133
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,960
That feels like he's doing this
on purpose.

134
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,960
The only thing more insulting
would be if he does go,

135
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,360
but does it inside
a giant plastic bubble.

136
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,640
I'm not technically here !
I'm not touching anything !

137
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,360
This doesn't count as a visit.
But maybe my favorite detail

138
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,400
is how one anchor tried to segue
into some more positive news.

139
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,880
It's unclear how soon Obama
will visit South Dakota

140
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,400
but with 21 months left on his
term, he does have plenty of time.

141
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,280
The Denny Sanford Premier officials
announced Rod Stewart

142
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,840
will perform Saturday,
July 25th in Sioux Falls.

143
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,680
That doesn't make it better,
South Dakota.

144
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,640
A night with Rod Stewart is only
a proper consolation prize

145
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,840
if your original goal was
to have sex with Peter Gabriel.

146
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,440
It's not like South Dakota
hasn't tried to lure the president.

147
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,760
Their secretary of tourism
wrote to him in 2013, inviting him,

148
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,240
pointing out his wife and daughters
visited Mount Rushmore

149
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,000
and saying:
"now it is your turn".

150
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,880
This is all getting so desperate.

151
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,120
You haven't even seen
their latest tourism ad.

152
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,640
Mr. President: South Dakota's
a beautiful, historic state.

153
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,760
Why won't you visit us ?

154
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,120
You can see all South Dakota's
amazing attractions:

155
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,240
the Corn Palace, Wall Drug,

156
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,640
that crazy horse monument
we're gonna try to finish soon,

157
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,320
the corn palace again, we got
some reptile gardens

158
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,200
and of course
the corn palace.

159
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,400
That's like six different things !

160
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,440
Plus, if you come,
you can meet some real nice people.

161
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,240
There's Gus, who closes
the buffalo gate at dusk.

162
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,240
Stay put, ya crazy buffalos !

163
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,640
There's Tony, who rides his bike
and points at squirrels.

164
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,920
And we got hobo
George R. R. Martin.

165
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,200
C'mon, Mr. President ! Sure, we
didn't vote for you. Either time.

166
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,120
But we love presidents so much,
we carved them into a mountain

167
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,760
and even have a whole wax
museum devoted to you guys.

168
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,080
You can see a Jimmy Carter
that will haunt your dreams,

169
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,960
George W. Bush at Ground Zero
which we thought was appropriate

170
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,560
and we think this is Bill Clinton,
but no one's entirely sure.

171
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,200
Don't forget, you can see Rod Stewart.
So we got that going for us.

172
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,640
C'mon, Mr. President ! For cryin'
out loud, you've been to Montana.

173
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,680
That state's nothing but barbed-wire
fences and goat-fuckers.

174
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,080
I'm sorry.
We shouldn't have said that.

175
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,440
It's true,
but we shouldn't have said it.

176
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,760
Please come to South Dakota,
Mr. President.

177
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,840
South Dakota: if you close your eyes,
you can pretend it's North Dakota.

178
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,160
Moving on.

179
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,640
Our main story
is government surveillance.

180
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,320
Most people would rather
discuss literally any other topic,

181
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,160
including "is my smartphone
giving me cancer ?"

182
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,040
to which the answer
is probably,

183
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,560
or "do goldfish
suffer from depression ?",

184
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,240
to which the answer is,
yes, but very briefly.

185
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,080
It is vital that we have
a discussion about this now,

186
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,960
because an important date
is around the corner.

187
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,640
One big date to circle
on the calendar,

188
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,400
the reauthorization
of the Patriot Act

189
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,800
and all of the provisions therein.

190
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,000
June first, they've got
to reauthorize or curtail this program.

191
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,560
Some controversial provisions
within the Patriot Act

192
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,960
are set to expire
on June the first,

193
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,760
so circle that date on your calendars,
and while you're at it,

194
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,800
circle June second as well,
because that's Justin Long's birthday.

195
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,840
You all forgot last year
and he fucking noticed.

196
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:19,880
Over the last years, you've
heard a lot about strange programs,

197
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,640
such as X-Keyscore, Muscular,
PRISM, and Mystic,

198
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,040
which are, also the names of some
of Florida's least popular strip clubs.

199
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,600
Welcome to X-Keyscore !
Our dancers are fully un-redacted !

200
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,320
And Tuesday is wing night !

201
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,520
I would like to refresh
your memory over some of this.

202
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,520
Let's start by focusing on the most
controversial portion up for renewal:

203
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:50,040
section 215,  which sounds like the
name of an eastern European boy band:

204
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,080
"We are section 215. Prepare
to have your hearts throbbed."

205
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,040
There's the cute one, the bad boy,
the one who strangled a potato farmer

206
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,600
and the one
without an iron deficiency.

207
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,000
The contents of the real section 215
is even more sinister.

208
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,280
It's called section 215, nicknamed
the library records provision,

209
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,280
which allows the government
to require businesses

210
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,360
to hand over records of
"any tangible things including"

211
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,480
"books, records, papers,
documents and other items."

212
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,440
If that sounds broad, it's because
it was written that way.

213
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,680
Section 215 says the government
can ask for "any tangible things",

214
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,160
so long as it's "for an investigation
to protect against terrorism."

215
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,600
It's like letting a teenager borrow
the car on the strict condition

216
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,920
that they use it only
for car-related activities.

217
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,280
Mom and dad, I'm gonna use
this for a hand-job

218
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,720
in the Wendy's parking lot,
but that is car-related.

219
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,080
Section 215 is overseen
by a secret intelligence court, FISA.

220
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,120
They've interpreted it to mean
the government could collect and store

221
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,640
phone records for every American,
the vast majority of whom

222
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,400
have no connection to terrorism.

223
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,200
Unless Aunt Cheryl has been
mischaracterizing the activities

224
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,720
of her needlepoint club.

225
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,640
It's a sleeper cell, isn't it,
Aunt Cheryl ?

226
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,560
You'll hang for this !
You're a traitor and a terrible aunt !

227
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,920
Not in that order.

228
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,920
The government will point
out that under 215,

229
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,800
they hold phone records
and not the calls themselves.

230
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,720
What the intelligence community
is doing

231
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:43,600
is looking at phone numbers
and durations of calls.

232
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,720
They are not looking at people's
names nor at content.

233
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,480
Yes,
but that's not entirely reassuring.

234
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,720
You can extrapolate
from that information.

235
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,600
If they knew you called
your ex 12 times last night

236
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,560
between one and four a.m.,
for 15 minutes each time,

237
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,440
they can be fairly sure you left
some pathetic voicemails:

238
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,560
I don't care
who's monitoring this call, Vicki,

239
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,040
we should be together !

240
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,360
Pick up the phone, damn it !
I'm a human being not an animal !

241
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,800
Now the Patriot Act was
written just after 9/11.

242
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,160
It was extended and reauthorized
with barely a passing thought.

243
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,560
It became so routine that
when it was extended in 2011,

244
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:33,760
one newscast tacked it onto the end
of a report about a presidential trip.

245
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,040
Chip Reid, CBS News, traveling with
the president in Deauville, France.

246
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,440
Also in France by the way,
President Obama signed into law

247
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,360
a 4-year extension
of the Patriot Act.

248
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,520
"Also in France, by the way".
He threw that in

249
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,360
like a mother telling her daughter
that her childhood pet just died.

250
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,040
Nice talking to you. Also, by the way,
Mister Peppers is dead,

251
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,440
see you at Christmas !

252
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,960
All of that was before the public
was made aware

253
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,920
of what the government's
capabilities were.

254
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,600
That all ended in June of 2013.

255
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,240
Edward Snowden has taken
responsibility

256
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,360
for one of the biggest government
leaks in US history.

257
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,360
The government has the capacity
to track every American phone call

258
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,360
and to scoop up vast quantities
of data across the internet.

259
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,800
Revelations that the NSA
eavesdropped on world leaders.

260
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,280
If you've ever been to the Bahamas,
the NSA could have recorded

261
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,400
your phone calls
and stored them.

262
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,720
All that information was exposed
by Edward Snowden.

263
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,360
And it is still kind of incredible that
a 29-year-old contractor

264
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,800
was able to steal top-secret documents
from an organization

265
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,920
that literally has the word security
in its name.

266
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,240
That was not great for them.
The only place where it should be

267
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,960
that easy for employees in their
twenties to steal is a Lids store.

268
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,520
Dude, you sure
I should take this ?

269
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,520
Relax, it's a Miami Marlins cap.
We're not selling Faberge eggs here.

270
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,200
It is still unclear how many documents
Edward Snowden stole.

271
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,120
He has tried to reassure people
he put them in good hands.

272
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,320
I don't want to be the person
making the decisions

273
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,840
on what should be public
and what shouldn't,

274
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,920
which is why rather than publishing
these or putting them out openly,

275
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,200
I'm running them
through journalists.

276
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,760
Sounds great, but
it's not a fail-safe plan.

277
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,000
Proven when New York Times
published this slide,

278
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,400
some people were able to read
the information behind that black bar,

279
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,840
which concerned how the US was
monitoring Al Qaeda in Mosul,

280
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,920
a group now known as ISIS.

281
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,720
A national security secret was leaked
because no one at the Times knows

282
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,760
how to use Microsoft Paint.

283
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,880
You can think that Snowden
did the wrong thing

284
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,760
or did it in the wrong way.

285
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,400
We have this information now

286
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,480
and we no longer get the luxury
of pleading ignorance.

287
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,880
It's like you can't go to Sea World and
pretend Shamu's happy anymore,

288
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,280
when we now know at least half
the water in her tank is whale tears.

289
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,600
You can't un-know that information.
You have to bear that in mind.

290
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,880
It's now two years later,
and we've kind of forgotten

291
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,160
to have a debate over the content
of what Snowden leaked.

292
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,800
A recent Pew report found
that nearly half of Americans say

293
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,000
they're "not very concerned"
or "not at all concerned"

294
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,040
about government surveillance.

295
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,680
Which is fine,
if that's an informed opinion.

296
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,600
I'm not sure that it is.
We sent a camera crew to Times Square

297
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,400
to ask some random passers by
who Edward Snowden was.

298
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,160
These are the responses
that we got.

299
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,400
No idea
who Edward Snowden is.

300
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,120
I've heard the name,
I just can't picture...

301
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,200
... think right now
what it is.

302
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,000
Edward Snowdený no.
I do not.

303
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,080
Just for the record:
that wasn't cherry-picking.

304
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,640
That was reflective of everyone
we spoke to.

305
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,080
Some did remember his name.
They couldn't remember why.

306
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,240
He sold some information.

307
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,840
He revealed some information
that shouldn't have been revealed.

308
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,000
The information that he shared
was detrimental to our military secrets

309
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,040
and keeping our soldiers
in our country safe.

310
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,520
He can leak documents about
the US army's operations in Iraq.

311
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:39,280
Snowden revealed a bunch of secrets
or information into WikiLeaks.

312
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,200
Snowden leaked,
he's in charge of WikiLeaks.

313
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,960
Edward Snowden revealed a lot
of documents through WikiLeaks.

314
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,440
Edward Snowden
is not the WikiLeaks guy.

315
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,600
The WikiLeaks guy is Julian Assange.
You don't want to be confused with him.

316
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,000
He was far less careful than Snowden
in what he released and how.

317
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,800
He resembles a bag full of biscuit
dough wearing a Stevie Nicks wig.

318
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,720
That is critical.
Julian Assange is not a likeable man.

319
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,520
Even Benedict Cumberbatch
could not make him likeable.

320
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,760
He's uncumberbatchable.

321
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,960
That was supposed
to be physically impossible.

322
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,680
I don't blame people
for being confused.

323
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,760
We've been looking at this story
for the last two weeks

324
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,920
and it is hard
to get your head around.

325
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,080
Not just because there are
so many complicated programs,

326
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,840
but also because there
are no easy answers here.

327
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,080
We all want perfect privacy
and perfect safety,

328
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,760
but those two cannot coexist.

329
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,960
It's like how you can't have
a badass pet falcon

330
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,400
and an adorable pet vole
named Herbert.

331
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,120
You have to lose one of them,
which you don't want to do,

332
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,600
or you accept reasonable
restrictions on both of them.

333
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,920
The NSA will argue that just
because they can do something,

334
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,440
doesn't mean they do do it,
and that there are restrictions

335
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:14,200
such as the FISA court, which must
approve requests for surveillance.

336
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:20,160
But in 34 years, that court
approved over 35 000 applications

337
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,000
and only rejected twelve.

338
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:28,840
Like Robert Durst's second wife,
the FISA court is alarmingly accepting.

339
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,960
Robert, I'm not going
to ask too many questions,

340
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,840
I'm gonna give you the benefit of
a doubt you clearly don't deserve.

341
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,320
At least tell him
to blink and burp less.

342
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,840
The burping might be the most
troubling thing about that show.

343
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,560
Maybe it's time for us to talk about
where the limits should be.

344
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,480
The best place to start
would be section 215.

345
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,120
Not because
it's the easiest to understand,

346
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,960
but because there is widespread
agreement it needs to be reformed.

347
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,320
From the president to Ted Cruz to both
the ACLU and the NRA

348
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,400
to even the guy who wrote
the thing in the first place.

349
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,080
I was the principle
author of the Patriot Act.

350
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,360
I can say that without qualification.
Congress never did intend to allow

351
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,120
bulk collections
when it passed section 215

352
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,560
and no fair reading of the text
would allow for this program.

353
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,080
He was the author !
That's the legislative equivalent

354
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,920
of Lewis Carroll seeing the teacups
ride at Disneyland and saying:

355
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,520
"This has to be reined in."

356
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,640
"No fair reading
of my text would allow for this ride."

357
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,760
You've turned my perfectly nice tale
of psychedelic pedophilia

358
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,360
into a garish vomitorium,
this is not what I wanted.

359
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,200
Even the NSA has said that
the number of terror plots in the US

360
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,280
that the section 215 telephone records
programs has disrupted is one.

361
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,960
That one particular plot involved
a cab driver in San Diego

362
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,160
who gave 8 500 dollars
to a terror group.

363
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,800
That is the shittiest terrorist plot
I've ever seen

364
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,840
other than the plot of
"A Good Day to Die Hard."

365
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,840
But here's the big problem:
if we let section 215 get renewed

366
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,840
in its current form, without serious
public debate, we're in trouble.

367
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,240
Section 215
is the canary in the coalmine.

368
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,360
If we cannot fix that, we're
not going to fix any of them.

369
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,600
The public debate so far
has been pathetic.

370
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,000
A year ago,
a former congresswoman

371
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,600
was discussing the 215 program
on the news.

372
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,480
Watch what happened.

373
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,440
This vast collection of data
is not that useful

374
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,400
and infringes substantially
on personal privacy.

375
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:55,440
We should seriously consider
not continuing Section 215...

376
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,000
Congresswoman Harman,
let me interrupt you.

377
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,320
We've got some breaking news
out of Miami. Stand by.

378
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,440
In Miami, Justin Bieber has been
arrested on a number of charges.

379
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,600
The judge is reading the charges,

380
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,400
including resisting arrest
and driving under the influence.

381
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,680
He's appearing now before
the judge for his bond hearing.

382
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,800
Actually, bad news: we're going
to have to interrupt your interruption

383
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,680
for a new interruption,
featuring a YouTube video

384
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,640
of a tortoise having sex
with a plastic clog.

385
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,880
That is the current tone
of this vitally important debate.

386
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,960
And, again, I'm not saying
this is an easy conversation.

387
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,080
But we have to have it.
I know this is confusing.

388
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,800
The most obvious person to talk
to about this is Edward Snowden.

389
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,120
But he lives in Russia. If you
wanted to ask him about these issues,

390
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,320
you'd have to fly all the way there,
and it is not a pleasant flight.

391
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,680
And the reason
I know that is that last week,

392
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,520
I went to Russia to speak to Snowden
and this is what happened.

393
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,960
Yes, last week I spent
48 paranoid hours in Moscow,

394
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,960
the last place where you can find an
overweight Joseph Stalin impersonator

395
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,640
arguing with an unconvincing
fake Lenin.

396
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,800
After experiencing Russia's
famously warm hospitality,

397
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,560
I went to meet Snowden, who was
supposed to show up at noon.

398
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,400
At 5 minutes after the interview
was scheduled to begin,

399
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,360
I had a troubling thought.

400
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,520
I don't know.
You think he's coming ?

401
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,720
'Cause my argument is, why would
he, when you think about it ?

402
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,920
I got 2 000 rubles that says
he doesn't make it,

403
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,240
without understanding
how much that is.

404
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,160
All I'm saying is,
a 10-hour flight for an empty chair.

405
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,320
I'm gonna lose my shit.

406
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,160
It turns out there may be a problem
because our Russian producer

407
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,520
booked us in a room
overlooking the old KGB building

408
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,640
and the home of the current
Federal Security Bureau.

409
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,720
We've just been told
they know we're here.

410
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,240
So that happened.

411
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,400
Just if the Russian KGB
is listening,

412
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,760
ring the fire alarm,
if he's not coming.

413
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,160
Shit.

414
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,360
God.

415
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,120
- So sorry for the delay.
- That's fine.

416
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:19,280
Holy shit. He actually came.
Edward fucking Snowden...

417
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,360
... the most famous hero and/or
traitor in recent American history.

418
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,120
I started with a question
designed to test his loyalties.

419
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,200
How much
do you miss America ?

420
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:38,680
My country is something
that travels with me.

421
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,720
That's a way
too complicated answer.

422
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,920
The answer is, I miss it a lot,
it's the greatest country.

423
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,320
I do miss my country,
my home, my family.

424
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:53,920
- Do you miss hot pockets ?
- Yes. Very much.

425
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,320
The entire state of Florida ?

426
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,280
Let's just let that silence
hang in the air.

427
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,360
- Do you miss truck nuts ?
- I don't know what they are.

428
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,120
Lucky for you, Edward.

429
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,480
Not just truck nuts,
stars and stripes truck nuts.

430
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,640
That is 2 balls of liberty
in a freedom sack.

431
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,200
- You've really thought ahead.
- At least one of us did.

432
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:37,120
No, 'cause of the quandary,
the Kafkaesque nightmare you're in.

433
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,720
Okay, let's dive in.
Why did you do this ?

434
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,000
The NSA has the greatest surveillance
capabilities we have ever seen.

435
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,800
They will argue they don't use this

436
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,960
for nefarious purposes
against American citizens.

437
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,480
In some ways, that's true.

438
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,560
But the real problem is that
they're using these capabilities

439
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,720
to make us vulnerable
to them and then saying:

440
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,760
"I have a gun pointed at your head,
not gonna pull the trigger. Trust me."

441
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,240
What's the NSA
you want look like ?

442
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,480
Because you applied for a job
at the NSA,

443
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,720
so you clearly see an inherent
value in that shadowy organization.

444
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,560
I worked with mass surveillance
systems against Chinese hackers.

445
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,400
These things do have
some purpose.

446
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,600
And you want your spies
to be good at spying, to be fair.

447
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:42,080
Right. You don't want them
spying inside their own country.

448
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,720
Spies are great
when they're on our side,

449
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,120
but we can never forget they're
powerful and dangerous

450
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,520
and if they're off the leash,
they can end up coming after us.

451
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,920
We're talking about 2 different things,
domestic and foreign surveillance.

452
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,040
Domestic surveillance,
Americans give some of a shit about.

453
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,480
Foreign surveillance, they don't
give any remote shit about.

454
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,520
When we talk
about foreign surveillance,

455
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,720
are we applying it in ways
that are beneficial ?

456
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,640
No one cares.
They don't give a shit.

457
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,320
We spied on UNICEF,
the children's fund.

458
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,360
- Sure.
- We spied on lawyers negotiating...

459
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:27,120
What was UNICEF doing ?
That's the question there.

460
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,000
Are these programs valuable ?
Are we going to be safer

461
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,520
when we're spying on UNICEF
and lawyers who are talking about

462
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,000
the price of shrimp
and clove cigarettes ?

463
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,600
People will say:
"I definitely don't care."

464
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,160
Americans do not give a shit
about foreign surveillance.

465
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,600
What some people do care about
is whether Snowden considered

466
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,560
the consequences of leaking
so much information at once.

467
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,400
How many of those documents
have you actually read ?

468
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,320
I've evaluated all the documents
that are in the archive.

469
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,040
- You've read every single one ?
- I understand what I turned over.

470
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:13,200
A difference between understanding
and reading what's in the documents.

471
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,160
I recognize the concern.

472
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,000
When you're handing over
thousands of NSA documents,

473
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,320
the last thing you want to do
is read them.

474
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,480
It's fair to be concerned about,
did this person do enough ?

475
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:31,840
Especially when you're handling
material like we know you're handling.

476
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,200
I'm not handling anything anymore.
That's been passed to the journalists

477
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,840
and they're using extraordinary
security measures to make sure

478
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,440
this is reported
in the most responsible way.

479
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,360
But those are journalists with
a lower technical skill set than you.

480
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,320
That's true but they do understand,
how important it is to get this right.

481
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,600
New York Times took a slide,
didn't redact it properly

482
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,400
and in the end it was possible
for people to see that something

483
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,720
was being used
in Mosul on Al Qaeda.

484
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,880
- That is a problem.
- Well that's a fuck up.

485
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,960
It is and these things
do happen in reporting.

486
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,560
In journalism, we have to accept
some mistakes will be made.

487
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,840
This is a fundamental
concept of liberty.

488
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:22,200
Right, but you have to own that then.
You're giving documents

489
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,520
with information you know could be
harmful, which could get out there.

490
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,960
Yes. If people act in bad faith...

491
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,080
You're not talking about bad faith,
but incompetence.

492
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:41,240
We are, but you will never be
free from risk if you're free.

493
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,960
The only time you can be free
from risk is when you're in prison.

494
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,000
While the risks were significant,

495
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,440
Snowden has made it clear
he feels rewards have been worth it.

496
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,920
You said "I was motivated
by a belief that the citizens"

497
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,080
"deserve to understand
the system in which they live."

498
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,000
"My fear was that no one
would listen to my warning."

499
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,040
"Never have I been so glad
to have been so wrong."

500
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,800
How did that feel ?

501
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,920
I was terrified this was gonna be
a 3 day story,

502
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,080
everybody was gonna
forget about it.

503
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,200
When I saw that everybody
around the world said:

504
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,280
"this is a problem. We have
to do something about this."

505
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,480
- Felt like vindication.
- Even in America ?

506
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,200
Even in America. And I think
we're seeing something amazing,

507
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:34,000
which is if you ask the American people
to make tough decisions,

508
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,320
to confront tough issues,
to think about hard problems,

509
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,480
they'll surprise you.

510
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:47,480
Here's the problem. I did ask some
Americans and did it surprise me.

511
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,280
I have no idea
who Edward Snowden is.

512
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,440
- You've never heard of Snowden ?
- No.

513
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,840
I have no idea
who Edward Snowden is.

514
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:02,640
I've heard the name, I can't
think now exactly what it is.

515
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,400
Sold some information to people.

516
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,800
He revealed some information
that shouldn't have been revealed.

517
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,480
Snowden revealed
documents through WikiLeaks.

518
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:22,040
Snowden revealed a bunch of secrets
or information into WikiLeaks.

519
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,200
Edward Snowden leaked,
he's in charge of WikiLeaks.

520
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,800
- I'm in charge of WikiLeaks.
- Not ideal.

521
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,240
You might be able to go home

522
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,760
'cause no one knows who the fuck
you are or what the fuck you did.

523
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,200
We can't expect everybody
to be uniformly informed.

524
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,240
Did you do this to solve a problem ?

525
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,840
I did this to give the American
people a chance to decide

526
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,760
the kind of government
they want to have.

527
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,920
That is a conversation the
American people deserve to decide.

528
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,960
It is a critical conversation,

529
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,800
but is it a conversation
we have the capacity to have ?

530
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,760
It's so complicated,
we don't fundamentally understand it.

531
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,120
It is a challenging conversation.

532
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,640
It's difficult for most people
to even conceptualize.

533
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,520
The internet is massively complex
and so much of it is invisible.

534
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:25,160
Service providers, technicians,
engineers, the phone numbers...

535
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,560
Let me stop you, Edward,
'cause this is the whole problem.

536
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,600
I just glaze over, 'cause it's like
the IT guy comes into your office

537
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,880
and you go "shit".

538
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,200
Don't teach me anything,
I don't want to learn.

539
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,200
You smell like canned soup.

540
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,000
It's a real challenge to figure out
how do we communicate

541
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,080
things that require sort of years
of technical understanding

542
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,520
and compress that
into seconds of speech.

543
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,680
I'm sympathetic to the problem.

544
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:04,960
Everything you did only matters if we
have this conversation properly.

545
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,360
So let me help you out there.
You mentioned in an interview

546
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,440
that the NSA was passing around
naked photos of people.

547
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:18,560
This is something where it's not
actually seen as a big deal

548
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,440
in the culture of NSA because you
see naked pictures all of the time.

549
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,240
That terrifies people because
when we asked people about that,

550
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,240
this is the response you get.

551
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,040
The government should not be able
to look at dick pictures.

552
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,600
If the government was looking
at a picture of Gordon's penis,

553
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,360
I feel it would be
an invasion of my privacy.

554
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,040
If they were looking at pictures
of my penis that would upset me.

555
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,720
The US government should
never have a picture of my dick.

556
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,320
If my husband sent me a picture
of his penis and the government

557
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,720
could access it I would want
that program to be shut down.

558
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,680
I would want the dick pic
program changed.

559
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,760
I would also want
the dick pic program changed.

560
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,680
It would be terrific
if the program could change.

561
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,960
I would want it to be tweaked,
I would want it to have clear laws

562
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,120
that we knew about and that were
communicated to us to understand

563
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,400
what they were being used for
or why they were being kept.

564
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,240
You think
that program exists ?

565
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,280
I don't think
that program exists.

566
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,840
No.

567
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:31,640
If I had knowledge that the US
government had a picture of my dick,

568
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,560
I would be very pissed off.

569
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:42,840
The good news is there's no program
named the dick pic program.

570
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,280
The bad news is they are still
collecting everybody's information,

571
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,920
including your dick pics.

572
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,880
What's the over under on that last
guy having sent a dick pic recently ?

573
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,320
You don't need to guess.
I'll show you.

574
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:02,000
I did take a picture of my dick
and I sent it to a girl recently.

575
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,760
This is the most visible line
in the sand for people.

576
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,760
Can they see my dick ?

577
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,240
So with that in mind,
look inside that folder.

578
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,280
That is a picture of my dick.

579
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,920
So let's go through each NSA program
and explain to me its capabilities

580
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:33,200
in regards to that photograph
of my penis.

581
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,960
So, 702 surveillance,
can they see my dick ?

582
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,600
Yes.
The FISA Amendments Act of 2008

583
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:46,120
which section 702 falls under
allows the bulk collection

584
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,880
of communications
that are one end foreign.

585
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,320
Bulk collection, now we're
talking about my dick. You get it.

586
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,320
- It's not what I expected.
- You get it though, right ?

587
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,520
Right, because of...
Yeah, anyway.

588
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,200
So if you have your email
somewhere like Gmail,

589
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,440
hosted on a server overseas or
transferred overseas

590
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,120
or at anytime crosses outside
the borders of the US,

591
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,280
your junk ends up
in the database.

592
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,440
So it doesn't have to be sending
your dick to a German ?

593
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,200
No. Even if you send it to
somebody within the US,

594
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,960
your wholly domestic communication
between you and your wife

595
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,480
can go from New York to London and
back and get caught in the database.

596
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,280
Executive order 12333,
dick or no dick ?

597
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:35,400
Yes. E.O. 12333 is what the NSA
uses when the other authorities

598
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,800
they're not catching
as much as they'd like.

599
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,800
How are they going to see my dick ?
I'm only concerned about my penis.

600
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,800
When you send your junk
through Gmail for example,

601
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,480
that's stored
on Google's servers.

602
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,240
Google moves data from data
center to data center,

603
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,720
invisibly to you
without your knowledge.

604
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,040
Your data could be moved outside
the borders of the US.

605
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:09,560
Temporarily. When your junk
was passed by Gmail,

606
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,840
the NSA caught a copy
of that.

607
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,040
PRISM ?

608
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:18,320
PRISM is how they pull your junk out
of Google with Google's involvement.

609
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:23,280
All of the different PRISM partners,
Yahoo, Facebook, Google,

610
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,680
the government deputizes them
to be their surveillance sheriff.

611
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,840
- They're a dick sheriff ?
- Correct.

612
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,440
Upstream ?

613
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,960
Upstream is how they snatch your junk
as it transits the internet.

614
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,720
Okay, MYSTIC.

615
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,680
If you're describing your junk
on the phone ? Yes.

616
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,800
Do they have the content of that
junk call or just the duration ?

617
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,200
They have the content as well,
but only for a few countries.

618
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,920
If you are on vacation
in the Bahamas ? Yes.

619
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,800
Finally, and do you need
to remind yourself ?

620
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,960
No, I'm just not sure what
to do with this. It's a lot of...

621
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,880
- Just hold on to it.
- It's a lot of responsibility.

622
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,600
It is a lot of responsibility
that's the point.

623
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,080
- Should I ?
- No you should absolutely not.

624
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,000
It's unbelievable that you would
do that. Actually it's believable.

625
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,840
- 215 metadata ?
- No.

626
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,480
- Good.
- But...

627
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,840
Come on, Ed.

628
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,800
They can probably tell who you're
sharing your junk pictures with

629
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,640
because they're seeing
who you're texting with.

630
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:29,160
If you call a penis enlargement center
and that call lasted 90 minutes ?

631
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,560
They would have a record
of your phone number calling

632
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,720
that phone number,
which is a penis enlargement center,

633
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,240
they would say they don't know
it's a center

634
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,200
but of course
they can look it up.

635
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,360
If the American
people understood this,

636
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,720
they would be absolutely horrified.

637
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,680
I guess I never thought about
putting it in the context of your junk.

638
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,040
Would a good takeaway
from this be,

639
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,720
until such time as we've
sorted all of this out...

640
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,720
Don't take pictures of your dick ?
Just don't do it anymore.

641
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,040
- No, if we do that...
- Wait. You're saying, no ?

642
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,680
You should keep taking pictures ?

643
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,040
Yes, you shouldn't change
your behavior

644
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,600
because an agency
is doing the wrong thing.

645
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,200
If we sacrifice our values
because we're afraid,

646
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,600
we don't care
much about those values.

647
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,840
That is a pretty inspiring answer
to the question:

648
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,040
"Why did you just send me
a picture of you dick ?"

649
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,560
Because I love America,
that's why.

650
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,120
There you have it, America.

651
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,720
All of us should now be equipped
to have this vital debate.

652
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,480
Because by June first,
it is imperative we have a rational,

653
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,280
adult conversation about whether
our safety is worth living

654
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:51,600
in a country of barely regulated
government sanctioned dick sheriffs.

655
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,320
And with my work here done

656
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,440
there was just time to take care
of one more thing.

657
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,880
Congratulations on Citizenfour
winning the Oscar.

658
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,520
I know you couldn't be at
the ceremony for obvious reasons...

659
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,960
I thought we'd celebrate ourselves.
Cheers !

660
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,200
That's really something.
Thank you.

661
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:18,240
You're welcome. What's the over
under on me getting back home safely ?

662
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,560
If you weren't on the list before,
you are now.

663
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:30,840
Is that like a joke
or is that actually possible ?

664
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,840
No, it's a real thing.
You're associated now.

665
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:39,400
Okay, just to be clear NSA,
I never met this guy.

666
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,080
So take me off your fucking list,
I do not want to get stuck in Russia.

667
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,160
I want to go home.

668
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:57,280
Now just for the record,
we got in touch with the NSA,

669
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,160
the National Security Council
and the White House

670
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,440
and we asked them to comment
on the dick-pic capabilities

671
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,200
of each of the programs
Snowden just discussed.

672
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,920
Which were some very fun emails
to write to government agencies.

673
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,160
They did not wish to comment.
I see why, for every possible reason.

674
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,760
But that's it, that's our show.
Thank you for watching.

675
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:22,080
Thank you to Edward Snowden.
See you next week. Good night.

676
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,400
