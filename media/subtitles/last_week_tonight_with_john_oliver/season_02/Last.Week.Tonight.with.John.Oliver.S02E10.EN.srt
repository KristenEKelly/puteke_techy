00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,800
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,200
Season II, episode 10

3
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,720
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I am John Oliver.

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,880
Thank you for being with us.
A quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,680
We begin with Vladimir Putin,
the man most likely to be

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,840
staring at a poster of a wolf
while doing hammer curls.

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,360
Putin addressed his people
in what has become an annual tradition.

8
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,480
Vladimir Putin is holding his 13th
annual question and answer marathon.

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,200
He invites members of the general
public to ask questions live on TV.

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,880
Who would not feel comfortable asking
a question to that friendly face ?

11
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,560
Putin did Q&A for four solid hours,
pre-empting hit Russian TV shows

12
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,120
such as, "Bear vs. Tiger:
Who is Most Strong ?"

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,400
and their famous sitcom "How Dare You
Claim to Know My Suffering ?"

14
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,800
He took questions
about Ukraine and the economy,

15
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,080
but a free and open dialogue
was never really the point of this.

16
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,360
It's well choreographed.
Those questions are selected

17
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,000
to highlight Putin the statesman,
his wry sense of humor.

18
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,560
This was really a showcase for
Putin's world-famous sense of humor.

19
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,000
He got a chance to use it during
one of the stranger questions.

20
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,360
Would you like to clone yourself ?
We have so many officials...

21
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,280
No. Next one.

22
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,800
That's it. Just no. Classic Putin.

23
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,440
You get the sense that he would be
the worst improv partner ever.

24
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,040
Vlad, we're here at the bakery.
No !

25
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,640
We are at steel mill that proves
the might of Russian industry.

26
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,920
I am me and you are Oprah.
And scene, scene.

27
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,880
The best moment was when
a woman asked Putin

28
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,640
if he would tell her friend's husband
Boris to let her get a dog.

29
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,400
A total softball to set him up
for a humanizing moment.

30
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,760
All he needed to do was say yes
and not get all weird about it.

31
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,480
You and me
could ask Boris together,

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,040
just request him in a friendly
way to allow Yelena

33
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,560
but Yelena might say,
okay I don't need a dog.

34
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,480
I'll do as you say,
my dear husband.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,600
I am sure after that he'll present her
an elephant as a gift.

36
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,280
It's just the issue of the right time
and the right place.

37
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,800
Maybe a fur coat...

38
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,680
I'm not sure about a fur coat
but maybe a dog.

39
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,600
We'll just ask the person Boris,
please.

40
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,160
What the fuck was that ?

41
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,640
To answer whether someone
should get a pet dog,

42
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,200
he mentioned marital submission,
the possibility of a pet elephant,

43
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,360
suggested the skin of a dead animal
as a potential dog substitute,

44
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,680
before finally just
deferring to Boris anyway.

45
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,640
That is a fascinating window
into his thought process

46
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,360
and it also suggests Crimea might
be about to get a pet elephant.

47
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,280
Let's move on to Oklahoma,

48
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,200
where this week
was some distressingly familiar news.

49
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,360
A volunteer Tulsa County deputy
is now facing a man slaughter charge

50
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,520
in the fatal shooting of a black
suspect during an undercover operation.

51
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,320
Prosecutors say 73-year-old
Robert Bates was negligent

52
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,000
for shooting Eric Harris
with a handgun instead of a Taser.

53
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,200
There is a lot to unpack there.
How do you mistake a gun for a Taser ?

54
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:19,240
What is a 73-year-old volunteer doing
in an undercover operation ?

55
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,880
We got an answer to the second
question, and it was not good.

56
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,400
Many wonder if Bates' close
relationship with his sheriff

57
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,920
led to this assignment.

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,400
Robert Bates has donated several
vehicles including a Dodge Charger,

59
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,280
a Crown Victoria
and a Toyota Avalon.

60
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,480
Giving away cars should not qualify
you for law enforcement.

61
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,760
At best it qualifies you to host
"The Price is Right". At best.

62
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,000
This is clearly a tragic story.
It was not made any better

63
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,200
when Bates decided to apologize in
the most uncomfortable way possible.

64
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,760
First and foremost, let me apologize
to the family of Eric Harris.

65
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,720
This is the second worst thing
that's ever happened to me,

66
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,320
or first,
ever happened to me in my life.

67
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,560
I've had cancer years ago.
I didn't think I was gonna get there.

68
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,160
I was able to go to a hospital
where I had hours of surgery.

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,520
I rate this as number one on my list
of things in my life that I regret.

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,200
So it was either the worst
or second-worst thing,

71
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,320
after that time you got cancer,
but then got better.

72
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,000
The only thing you're a victim of
is a creepy six-hand massage.

73
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,520
Bates is not the only one at fault.
It's also on the Tulsa sheriff's office

74
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,360
for letting a 73-year-old man act
as backup on a firearms sting.

75
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,080
There are many things we should
allow 73-year-olds to do

76
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,720
without putting up a fight,
like use the phrase "the Hispanics",

77
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,800
or get into fights
over cribbage matches,

78
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,880
or sign their name at the end
of Facebook comments,

79
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,680
but when it comes to law enforcement,
to paraphrase Danny Glover,

80
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,080
a 73-year-old man
is literally too old for this shit.

81
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:27,040
And finally this week,
I'd like to talk about Earth Day.

82
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,720
Don't worry, you didn't miss it,
it's next Wednesday.

83
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,840
So you still have a chance to think
about the problems facing the planet

84
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,560
and brace yourself
for inane TV segments like this.

85
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,080
- What are we doing here ?
- An Earth Day birthday party.

86
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,360
You take your old cereal boxes
and you make... Like my little hat ?

87
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,960
It's adorable.

88
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,080
Making craft projects out of garbage
is not how you save the environment.

89
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,360
It's what you do on a first date
with Zooey Deschanel.

90
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,400
But let's give them credit:

91
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,080
they're trying to get people
to engage in environmental issues,

92
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,720
which is increasingly difficult,
we've become immune to shock.

93
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,600
Look at that classic image of a polar
bear balancing on a block of ice.

94
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,880
That used to horrify people,
but now, it's lost its power.

95
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,720
It's like looking at pornography
from the 1840's.

96
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,440
I don't care how much shin
that woman is showing,

97
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,720
I just feel nothing.

98
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,600
Things have got worse
for polar bears.

99
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,760
A study showed that environmental
toxins could potentially cause them

100
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,480
to be at risk of
increased risk of species extinction

101
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,200
as a result of weak penile
bones and risk of fractures.

102
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,840
In layman's terms, pollution could
cause polar bears to break their dicks.

103
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,480
I know what you're thinking:
"John, wait, John !"

104
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,680
Polar bears don't have dick bones.
It turns out, you're wrong.

105
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,640
Let me introduce you to the wonderful
world of polar bear lovemaking.

106
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,880
It's the male's thrusting penis
which causes her to release an egg.

107
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,840
But it could take up to 2 weeks.

108
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,600
To help her conceive,
he's got a trick up his sleeve,

109
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,200
a bone right in the middle
of his penis.

110
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,120
It's called a baculum and it doesn't
just help to stimulate ovulation.

111
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,560
It keeps him hard.

112
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,440
Yeah. Now you understand
why those Coca-Cola bears

113
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,640
have to hold bottles
in front of them.

114
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,880
They have raging erections
all the time. Always.

115
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:47,040
This story is upsetting.
But it's also an opportunity.

116
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,200
For at least half the population,

117
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,720
having your dick bone snap in half
is viscerally upsetting.

118
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,960
I would suggest that we retire
the "polar bear on a chunk of ice"

119
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,480
as the face of global pollution,
and replace it with this image

120
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,400
of a polar bear
clutching its shattered penis.

121
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,760
That will get people's attention.
And don't just take it from me.

122
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,560
Take it from the new face of Earth Day,
my friend and yours,

123
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,280
Marshmallow, the polar bear
with a broken penis.

124
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,520
Marshmallow, are you sad ?

125
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:24,520
Because your chemically-weakened
penis bone snapped in half ?

126
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,800
That's why you're sad ?
What specific action do you think

127
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,240
the international community should
commit to prevent this ?

128
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,200
You don't know ? Are you
struggling to think of a plan

129
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,320
because of how much
your penis hurts ?

130
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,280
So, c'mon, everyone !
This Earth Day,

131
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,920
I want you to think of Marshmallow's
devastated penis.

132
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,840
Because while it may not
be salvageable,

133
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,240
others still could be !

134
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,920
So clap your hands
if you want hard polar bear penises !

135
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,520
We can do this !
Happy Earth Day, everyone !

136
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,520
And now this ! You're okay.

137
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,040
The most patient man on television
endures the American public.

138
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,560
I don't know what's going on
in this world right now.

139
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,160
Obama's a Muslim
and that's all I gotta say.

140
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,480
Obama is not a Muslim
but thank you for your comment.

141
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,680
I watch all 3 of your channels 6 CSPAN,
CSPAN 1 and CSPAN 2.

142
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,120
CSPAN 3, I'm sorry.
And it's heavily Republican.

143
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
I thought this was a free country.

144
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,480
We've excluded God from everything
and look at what's happening to us.

145
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,560
We should probably send in
special forces, similar to Rambo.

146
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,880
I don't know enough
about the military.

147
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,760
Just scare them off, tell them or else
I'll blow your head off.

148
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,760
Having our government do nothing,
it's treason.

149
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,000
That's what brings us to idiocracy.

150
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,720
Okay.

151
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,480
Moving on: our main story
tonight concerns patents.

152
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,520
They're legally binding dibs.
And they're important.

153
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,920
If you invent something and
it's approved by Patent and Trademark,

154
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,400
the rights to that idea
then belong to you.

155
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,360
They're essential to business,

156
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,360
as you would know,
if you've ever seen "Shark Tank".

157
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,440
Why aren't you telling me about
something proprietary or a patent ?

158
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,400
I hope you do get your patent
and I wish you good luck.

159
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,120
Without having it,
you're gonna have a struggle.

160
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,880
Don't have a patent, a finished sample,
experience.

161
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,440
Unless you have a patent or proprietary
technology, you're in trouble.

162
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,480
I'm out.

163
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,320
Arriving at "Shark Tank" without
a patent is like turning up

164
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,440
to "America's Next Top Model"
without knowing how to smize.

165
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,880
You take that shit to catalog !
You're not editorial !

166
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,840
I don't know what that means
but the point is,

167
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,600
if you don't have a patent, you don't
have a prayer on "Shark Tank."

168
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,080
Unless you've got a once-in-a-lifetime
investment opportunity like this guy.

169
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,760
You go to my site. You describe a cat.
I draw it, I mail it. As easy as that.

170
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,480
I'd invest if I were you.
I want to draw a cat for you.

171
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,800
His business got funded.
Presumably because he holds the patent

172
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,760
on whatever the fuck
he's doing with his shoulders.

173
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The patent system
has been prone to abuse.

174
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,040
A man named Austin Meyer
made a popular flight simulator app.

175
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,520
One day,
received a frightening letter.

176
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,280
It said that a company called Uniloc
was filing suit against me.

177
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,720
The company is suing Meyer
for patent infringements.

178
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,240
Uniloc says it owns the idea
of a computer program

179
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,480
checking a central server
for authorization.

180
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,360
It is the technology upon which
all Android apps are based.

181
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,800
- All Android apps ?
- Every one I know of.

182
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,720
This company, Uniloc, is claiming
it's entitled to a piece of every app.

183
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,080
That means they could show up
at the headquarters of Tinder

184
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,000
and demand a cut of everything
Tinder has created.

185
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,560
Which I assume would be a pile
of STD's, sad orgasms

186
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,680
and shards of human self-esteem,
that's the business model.

187
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:48,960
This became so common, there's
even a name for companies that do this.

188
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,360
So-called patent trolls don't invent
or sell anything.

189
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,320
They buy patents and make their
money by threatening lawsuits.

190
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,680
Most of these companies
don't produce anything,

191
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,880
they just shake down
anyone who does.

192
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,640
So calling them "trolls"
is a little misleading.

193
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,480
At least trolls do something:

194
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,520
they control bridge access for
goats and ask people fun riddles.

195
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,600
Patent trolls just threaten to sue
the living shit out of people.

196
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,120
Those lawsuits add up.

197
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,000
Of the 4 700 patent lawsuits filed
in 2012,

198
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,600
3 000 were from these so-called
patent trolls.

199
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,400
The White House claims during
the last 2 years,

200
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,800
the number of lawsuits brought
by patent trolls has tripled.

201
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,160
This type of litigation cost investors

202
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,280
half a trillion dollars since 1990.

203
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,520
Half a trillion !
Let me put that in context:

204
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,080
to lose other people
that amount of money,

205
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,160
Johnny Depp would have had to star
in "The Lone Ranger"

206
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,240
over 100 times a year
for 25 years.

207
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,560
That's a horrifying amount !
Horrifying.

208
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,400
And patent trolls target everyone,
from Apple and Samsung,

209
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,600
to tiny ones.

210
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,680
You don't need to make something
to be targeted.

211
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,560
You just need to use something.

212
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,600
A business couldn't believe it when
someone threatened to sue them

213
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,600
for using
their own copy machine.

214
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,440
We provide employment services
for people with barriers to employment,

215
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,480
mostly people with disabilities.

216
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,360
FolNer LLC threatened to file unless
Hurley forked over $1 000

217
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,760
for each employee who uses the scan
to email function on this copier.

218
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,080
FolNer says it's entitled
to this licensing money

219
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,720
because it owns
the patents for that process.

220
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,880
When you are threatening to sue
a company which helps

221
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,240
people with disabilities find work
for using their own photocopier,

222
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,480
you're not just on the road to hell,

223
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,080
you have your own parking spot
right next to the fucking devil.

224
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,200
How exactly did we get
ourselves into this mess ?

225
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,200
In part, it has to do with the types
of patents that have been issued.

226
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,160
The patent office is supposed
to certify inventions

227
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,960
that are "new, useful,
and non-obvious".

228
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,120
All the adjectives Tom Cruise would
say he's seeking in an ideal mate.

229
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,520
But during periods
of big technological change,

230
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,200
they get overwhelmed
and certify patents they shouldn't.

231
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,040
This happened in the 19th century
with railroads,

232
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,760
and recently,
with the development of software.

233
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,280
The number of software
patents has skyrocketed.

234
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,240
The issue here, say experts,

235
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,800
is that while patents for machines
tend to be fairly specific,

236
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,320
software patents can be so broad
that they may give someone

237
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,280
the ability to later claim ownership
for inventions they never dreamed of.

238
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,840
And that is the seed
of our current problems.

239
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,320
If a troll can get
a vaguely-defined software patent,

240
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,040
they can demand payment for
anything that fits that description.

241
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,640
If they'd thought to patent
"computer thing that never works",

242
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,640
they'd be currently getting rich
off of "Facetime".

243
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,120
Very rich.

244
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,760
Patent trolls have this process
down to such a science.

245
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,240
They figured out a way
to almost never go to trial.

246
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:15,000
90 percent of cases are settled
for a very practical reason.

247
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,600
It's an extortion game
because it costs

248
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,000
between 2 and 5 million dollars
to defend a patent suit.

249
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,680
So the patent troll says,
we'll settle for 100 000.

250
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,480
Many decide to pay out settlements
because it's cheaper than the lawsuit.

251
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,120
So they work out the maximum
amount you'd be willing to pay,

252
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,320
rather than go to court
and negotiate for that.

253
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,360
They pick a number the same way
airlines pick a cabin temperature

254
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,960
perfectly calibrated
to make you miserable,

255
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,120
but not so much that you'd
actually do anything about it.

256
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,440
Sometimes it's hard to know
who's behind all of this.

257
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,240
They often have vague company
names like IP Nav, Empire IP

258
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,440
or Pragmatus.

259
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,320
Pragmatus sounds like the most
boring mythological Greek hero.

260
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,440
I am Pragmatus ! I shall not battle the
hydra, for it is much larger than me.

261
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,360
So I shall go home
by the farmers' market,

262
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,760
for the bruised vegetables
are cheaper at the end of the day.

263
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,520
Pragmatus bids you farewell.

264
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:28,480
Patent trolls found the friendliest
place to file their lawsuits.

265
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,120
Almost a quarter of last year's
US patent cases were filed

266
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,800
in this Eastern Texas federal
court district.

267
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,480
Marshall, Texas.
Population: 24 000.

268
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,560
A quarter of all patent cases
are filed in Marshall, Texas.

269
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,960
It's not because the people there
are inventing like a meth-head.

270
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,600
I combined a wheel with a nail.
It's a nail-wheel !

271
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,360
New invention ! Patent !

272
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,320
Here's four feet of PVC piping I can
use for a big straw ! Patent !

273
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,680
I'm a genius !
Gimme more meth !

274
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,480
Patent trolls have figured out that
east Texas judges and juries

275
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,400
are sympathetic to plaintiffs.

276
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,080
It has been so effective
that big companies are having to go

277
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,840
to absurd lengths to pander
to the people of Marshall.

278
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,160
Tech companies know the value
of a good PR campaign here,

279
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,080
where almost anyone
could be on your next jury.

280
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Samsung sued here multiple times,
has spent almost a million dollars

281
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,560
on community projects like
this ice skating rink.

282
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,120
Samsung was so frightened
of patent lawsuits,

283
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,960
they felt forced to build
an outdoor ice rink in Texas.

284
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,200
Do you know
how hard that is to maintain ?

285
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,120
It's like building
a bowling alley in space.

286
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:00,080
This situation is insane. There is
cross-party support in Washington

287
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,560
for fixing this problem,
a bipartisan bill was introduced

288
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,000
two years ago
called "The Innovation Act",

289
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,560
encouraging judges to make patent
trolls pay court costs if they lose

290
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,760
and forcing patent trolls to be more
transparent about their identities.

291
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,240
I'm not saying that bill was perfect,
but it would've helped.

292
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,640
It's like when parents of
teenagers lock the liquor cabinet.

293
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,200
I know this isn't going to stop you,
Rhapsody.

294
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,840
It will make it harder for you
to fuck up the neighborhood.

295
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,960
While the bill passed the House
by an overwhelming majority,

296
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,680
it never even made it
to a vote in the Senate.

297
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,960
Why would that be ?

298
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,160
What do you make
of this bill getting killed ?

299
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,800
I know this is news but trial lawyers'
influence in Washington is alive.

300
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,200
Lobbyists for groups including trial
lawyers managed to prevent the bill

301
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,600
from moving forward.

302
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,000
You cannot let trial lawyers decide

303
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,800
whether there should be
more baseless lawsuits.

304
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,040
That's the equivalent of trusting
raccoons to make laws

305
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,880
about garbage can placement.

306
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,920
They should be easy to reach
and left slightly open !

307
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,400
All in favor say...

308
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,320
That's a good impression
as far as you know.

309
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,040
There is a glimmer of hope here,
that bill is making the rounds again.

310
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,120
Even if it doesn't pass,
something has to.

311
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,040
We have to do something or the only
viable business left in America

312
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,400
is going to be one that relies
on no patents.

313
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,320
I can only think of only one
business that fits that description.

314
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,640
I'll draw you a cat, whatever the vibe.
I draw the cat that you describe.

315
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,480
I guess all I'm saying is, hit it.

316
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,880
Let's reform our patents quick
or we will all be in the shit.

317
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,800
And now, this.

318
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,520
The continuing adventures of the most
patient man on television.

319
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,800
- You can hear me ?
- I can, go ahead, Paul.

320
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,120
- This is Paul Beach speaking.
- You're on the air. Go ahead.

321
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,280
Blacks need to take a little bit
more responsibility for themselves.

322
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,880
This government has a habit
of putting labels on people:

323
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,360
jap, kraut, Indian, VC.

324
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,960
Brutish, brainless, bloated,
blackmailing, bribing,

325
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,600
bamboozling bureaucracy.

326
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:45,160
Zionist neocon Jews
are behind all of this.

327
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,400
The Jews that run the media.

328
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,040
The Jews are great people.
It's just only the big time ones

329
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,120
that control all the finances
in America.

330
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,680
- I'm not prejudiced.
- I'm not racist. I'm not sexist.

331
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,840
I'm not a hater.

332
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,320
We need to get rid of every Muslim
out of the country

333
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,120
because they
are sent here to kill us.

334
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,640
Okay, we'll leave it at that.

335
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,800
Finally tonight, let's turn to some
lighter news: the end of the world.

336
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,720
The news is constantly full
of potential causes,

337
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,520
whether it's nuclear Armageddon
or environmental destruction.

338
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,280
I told you ! That bear is
the new face of Earth Day !

339
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,880
As we learned earlier this year,
one news network has planned

340
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,960
what they'll show
during humanity's final moments.

341
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,640
If this is ever on CNN, it means
the world is coming to an end.

342
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,560
It's called Turner Doomsday Video.
Something Ted Turner produced

343
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,080
to air on Doomsday
when the world's ending.

344
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,920
The restriction says:

345
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,880
"hold for release till end
of the world confirmed."

346
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,640
That's great, CNN, so you're going
to wait till the end of the world

347
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,160
to confirm something.

348
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,600
I will admit, I'm intrigued by this.
I'm intrigued by the idea

349
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,200
so tell me, what is the last thing
CNN wants all of us to see ?

350
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,200
That's it ?
A band playing a slow dirge ?

351
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,840
When the world ends,
it would be comforting to look

352
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,360
at any marching band and think:
"at least they'll all die too."

353
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,560
If the music they were playing rings
a bell, might be a reason for that.

354
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,040
Armed Forces Marching Bands
play "Nearer My God to Thee",

355
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,920
the hymn that, as legend has it,
was played as the Titanic sank.

356
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,920
That was not the music that played
when the Titanic sank. This was.

357
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,640
The last thing those
drowning people heard

358
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,480
was some sort of French-Canadian
space mermaid.

359
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
That's a history fact.

360
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,000
If humanity's time is going to end,
this cannot be the last thing we see.

361
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,920
A doomsday video shouldn't be sad,
it should be celebratory.

362
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,800
We've produced a new video
for the end of the world,

363
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,200
for CNN and anyone else to use.

364
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,800
Enjoy !

365
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,760
Hello, I'm Martin Sheen

366
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,840
and I'm afraid if you're watching this,
the end times are upon us.

367
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:01,520
Whether because of war, disease
or a genetically modified dinosaur,

368
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,960
our world is now only moments
away from total annihilation.

369
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,960
So, let's take these last few moments
to celebrate the greatest things

370
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,600
about humanity's time on earth.

371
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,040
We had a good run, didn't we ?

372
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,160
We harnessed fire,
invented languages

373
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,280
and engineered transparent
underwater tunnels

374
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,160
because
we felt like looking at shark tummies.

375
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,760
We were the first species
to evolve to walk on two legs

376
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,280
and then invented a way not to.

377
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,640
Perhaps humanity's greatest
achievement of all

378
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,040
was our total domination of every
other species.

379
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,320
Nice try, lions.

380
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,280
Unless we are all dying because lions
evolved and conquered the human race.

381
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,680
In which case, well played, lions.

382
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,400
Humanity sometimes failed to live up
to our potential

383
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,400
as evidenced by our blooper reel.

384
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,280
It seems our time together
as a species is drawing short

385
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,840
and life on earth
is about to end.

386
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,400
Before we all embrace
whatever awaits us,

387
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,680
I have something
important to show you.

388
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,000
It's a model of an old West saloon

389
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,680
filled with cat bartenders
and cat cowboys.

390
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,360
Cats. In conclusion, don't be sad
over what we're losing.

391
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,160
Instead think fondly
of what we had.

392
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,920
So let's give thanks to peanut butter,
to waterslides, to the night sky,

393
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,320
to the Beatles
and the Pyramids.

394
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,560
To that YouTube video of
Kelsey Grammer falling off a stage.

395
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,920
The UN interpreter... Good lord.

396
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,480
We did things few thought possible.
We mastered the art of the yo-yo

397
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,240
and had a cereal
that was nothing but cookies.

398
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,920
We invented the automobile
and then invented an automobile

399
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,680
that could drive
over 20 other automobiles.

400
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,360
We made backpacks that looked
like animals

401
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,520
and had those same animals
wear them.

402
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,040
We set pointless world records,

403
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,880
we mastered relative time
and hammer time.

404
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,240
We developed string theory
and string cheese.

405
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,640
We went to the moon.

406
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,680
So now before we're all
vaporized or whatever awaits us,

407
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,520
it's fitting that the last thing
we all see

408
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,600
is this sick basketball shot.

409
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,320
We did it.
This is Martin Sheen, over and out.

410
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,800
That's our show !

411
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,240
Thank you so much to Martin Sheen
and those cats. Good night !

412
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,440
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

413
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,440
END OF EPISODE 10,
SEASON II
