00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,080
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,040
Season 2
Episode 14

3
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,960
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,920
Thank you so much
for being with us.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,880
I'm John Oliver. Just time
for a quick recap of the week.

6
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,280
And we start tonight
with the NSA,

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,280
the most obnoxious
record collectors

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,680
outside of hipsters who insist
that vinyl "sounds warmer."

9
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,280
Last month, you might remember,
we spoke to Edward Snowden

10
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,880
about Section 215
of the Patriot Act,

11
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,280
which authorizes
the Phone Records Program.

12
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,480
It's up for renewal
at the end of May.

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,240
And this week, there was some
surprising news.

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,320
The big debate over government
surveillance continuing to roil.

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,520
The House
passing a measure today

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,880
that would effectively stop the NSA's
mass collection of phone records.

17
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,920
Holy shit.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,880
A meaningful bill passing with broad
bipartisan support.

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,800
It's like discovering yourself
sexually for the first time.

20
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,280
"I don't know
what this sensation is,

21
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,480
"but I think I like it

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,080
and I want it
to happen again."

23
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,080
Yes. The House...

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,400
The House overwhelmingly passed
the USA Freedom Act.

25
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,880
It is by no means perfect,

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,160
but it does put
some new limits in place

27
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,960
to protect
Americans' privacy.

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,480
It now heads to the Senate

29
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,800
where it is opposed
by Mitch McConnell.

30
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,120
But he might be facing
an uphill battle

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,920
because members of both parties
support reforming 215,

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,880
as do the President,
the Director of National Intelligence,

33
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,480
and a federal appeals court
which recently ruled

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,800
the program had never
been authorized by the law,

35
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,600
which is alarming.

36
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,600
It's like finding out

37
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,760
the guy who just gave you
a prostate exam

38
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,160
wasn't a doctor.

39
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,160
"Hey, what's going on here ?

40
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,880
"That is Jim, the janitor
with a latex fetish.

41
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,440
"Get out of here, Jim.
Get out of here.

42
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,440
That's strike two, Jim."

43
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,440
But Mitch McConnell desperately
does not want to change anything,

44
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,520
and instead has offered
the lamest possible plan.

45
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,120
What I would
rather see, George,

46
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,880
is a couple-of-month extension
of the existing program.

47
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,880
A couple of months ?
That's pathetic.

48
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,120
Asking for more time
for no apparent reason

49
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,520
is exactly what you do when you know
you're about to be dumped.

50
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,880
His bill might as well
be called

51
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,080
the Hey, Babe, Can We Talk
About This When Things

52
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,560
Have Died Down At Work A Bit
Act of 2015.

53
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,160
So let's move on to FIFA,

54
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,840
the NFL of actual football.

55
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,520
They are an objectively
appalling organization,

56
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,600
and next week they have
a presidential election.

57
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,800
The most powerful man
in world football,

58
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,080
Sepp Blatter, has said
he will stand for a fifth term

59
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,760
as president of FIFA.

60
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,760
Now if you don't know
who Sepp Blatter is,

61
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,240
think of Roger Goodell.

62
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,440
And now think
of Roger Goodell's asshole.

63
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,760
That is Sepp Blatter.

64
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,920
Because this is a man
who in the past

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,880
has suggested increasing the popularity
of women's soccer

66
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,000
by having them wear
tighter shorts,

67
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,800
overseen an organization
that has been plagued

68
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,960
by numerous scandals,
and also did this.

69
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,880
The winner to organize

70
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,880
the 2022 FIFA World Cup

71
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,080
is Qatar !

72
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,880
Yes, on Sepp Blatter's watch,

73
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,360
the World Cup
was given to Qatar,

74
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,920
where temperatures
can reach 120 degrees.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,920
The only place less appropriate
to host a World Cup

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,920
would be the actual surface
of the sun.

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Although to be fair,
the sun does have

78
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,960
a much better human-rights record
than Qatar does.

79
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,600
And yet, despite all of this,
the crazy thing is,

80
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,160
Sepp Blatter is widely expected
to win reelection,

81
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,320
even though a hairless bear
would do less damage as president.

82
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,320
A hairless bear,
who incidentally,

83
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,840
looks a great deal
like Sepp Blatter.

84
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,200
That's uncanny resemblance.

85
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,400
In fact,
Blatter is so confident of victory,

86
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,400
he has refused to debate
or campaign for reelection.

87
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,240
And this is how he responded
when asked.

88
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,320
My manifesto is the work
I have done

89
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,440
in the last years
in FIFA.

90
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,680
I am now 40 years in FIFA,

91
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,080
and I am 17 years
the president of FIFA.

92
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,160
This is my manifesto.

93
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,440
Listen, Sepp Blatter saying
I stand by my work

94
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,680
is like a puppy standing by
the work it did

95
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,600
after being left alone
in the house for the first time.

96
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,360
"Hey, you've seen
what I can do. I stand by it.

97
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,560
This is my manifesto."

98
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,960
And finally this week,

99
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,360
we turn to Australia,

100
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,760
not just the country
where Russell Crowe lives,

101
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,840
but very much
the Russell Crowe of countries.

102
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,240
Australia is a land
of many exotic animals,

103
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,240
from this weird thing
that shouldn't exist

104
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,840
to this weird thing
that shouldn't exist.

105
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,960
Hey, furry things don't
have bills, you little creep.

106
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,120
Knock it off.

107
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,880
This week, Australia
had some international animal drama.

108
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
Hollywood star Johnny Depp
is in trouble

109
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,200
with the Australian government
after they found out

110
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,920
he snuck his two dogs
into the country on his private jet.

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,320
This is the house
on Australia's Gold Coast

112
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,320
currently being rented
by Hollywood star Johnny Depp.

113
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,920
And here inside
are two illegal aliens,

114
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,880
Pistol and Boo.

115
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,880
This story is amazing.

116
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,920
It appears
that actor Johnny Depp...

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,640
I'm sorry, that's just a fedora
atop a pile of greasy hair.

118
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,920
Apparently
actor Johnny Depp...

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,120
Sorry, that's just a trash bag
full of scarves.

120
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,440
Apparently, actor Johnny Depp
allegedly decided

121
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,360
to bring his two dogs,
Pistol and Boo, to Australia,

122
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,240
where he's currently filming the latest
Pirates of the Caribbean movie,

123
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,920
which I can only assume is entitled
Pirates of the Caribbean,

124
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,400
Did Anyone Actually
Ask For This ?

125
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,920
The problem is,

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,240
Australia has strict
customs and quarantine rules

127
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,880
to prevent the spread
of diseases.

128
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,880
You can't just smuggle in
your pets,

129
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,440
which is why Australia's
Minister for Agriculture

130
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,120
Barnaby Joyce
was so angry.

131
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,880
If we start letting movie stars,
even though they've been

132
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,320
"The Sexiest Man Alive" twice,
to come into our nation,

133
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,880
then why don't we just
break the laws for everybody ?

134
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,320
So it's time
that Pistol and Boo

135
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,320
buggered off back
to the United States.

136
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,600
Okay. Okay.

137
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,480
I've got to say,
that's pretty ballsy.

138
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,760
Elected officials
very rarely risk

139
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,080
openly telling puppies
to go fuck themselves.

140
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,480
And, look,
he's not wrong to be angry.

141
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,320
The problem is, he quickly started
to lose the moral high ground.

142
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,880
Now Mr. Depp

143
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,880
has to either take his dogs
back to California

144
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,000
or we're going
to have to euthanize them.

145
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,400
This is... He's now got
about 50 hours left

146
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,880
to remove the dogs.

147
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,600
He gave them
a death countdown.

148
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,880
And this became
such a global sensation,

149
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,280
The Guardian even had a clock
ticking down the seconds

150
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,080
on its website,
which is confusing,

151
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,080
because countdown clocks
are usually for good things.

152
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,280
"Three, two, one, yay !

153
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,880
"Wait, wait, wait.
What are we celebrating again ?

154
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,880
Oh, right,
Johnny Depp's dogs are dead."

155
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,880
The problem is,
for an agriculture minister,

156
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,880
Barnaby Joyce doesn't seem
to be great around animals,

157
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,200
because this
is an actual photo of him

158
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,200
staring menacingly
at an alpaca.

159
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,400
Look at him.
He hates that alpaca.

160
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,960
The amount of loathing
and contempt he feels

161
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,880
for that glassy-eyed
Muppet donkey is incalculable.

162
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,920
And the thing is,
even fellow Australians,

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,840
to be fair, felt that Joyce was acting
like a bit of a dick.

164
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,240
"What I'm saying is,
you sound like an absolute clown,

165
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,760
"telling the guy to bugger off back
to Hollywood, or we'll kill his dogs.

166
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,160
"You sound like an idiot.

167
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,760
"You're a government minister,

168
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,120
not some idiot off the street
mouthing off to a news camera.

169
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,000
"Have some decency."

170
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,400
"That's interesting coming from you,
mate, you're the number one..."

171
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,000
"Shut up, Barnaby, you...
You're an absolute joke, Barnaby.

172
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,040
"I'm going off because you sound
like an insensitive wanker."

173
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,560
I am not sure finer words

174
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,720
have ever been spoken
in the English language

175
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,560
than, "Shut up, Barnaby,
you insensitive wanker."

176
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,880
Someone stitch that
onto a throw pillow immediately.

177
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,360
Do it !

178
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,760
But thankfully, with the countdown
clock ticking down,

179
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,880
Pistol and Boo escaped.

180
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,240
Johnny Depp's two terriers
have met their death deadline,

181
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,120
flying out of the country
in a private jet last night.

182
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,920
Australia's minister
of agriculture

183
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,200
tweeted this morning,
"Dogs gone."

184
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,280
You hope
that "dogs gone" means

185
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,600
"Johnny Depp's dogs
have left the country."

186
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,040
But given everything
we've learned so far, it could mean,

187
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,880
"I did it. I killed all the dogs.

188
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,600
I, Barnaby Joyce,
killed all the dogs."

189
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,080
Look, Australia,

190
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,680
I hope that getting
those dogs out was worth it,

191
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,360
because I'm afraid that your minister
has just made this personal,

192
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,280
and America has no choice
but to respond.

193
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,160
Greetings, Australia.

194
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,040
Well, we did what you wanted.

195
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,960
We took
Johnny Depp's dogs back.

196
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,800
But guess what ?

197
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,880
Now we have
some demands of our own.

198
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,240
As of this moment,
you've got 50 hours

199
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,600
to get everything Australian
out of our country or else...

200
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,000
You can start by taking back
all your disgusting Vegemite,

201
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,680
which tastes like a kangaroo
took a salty shit in a jar.

202
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,880
And while you're at it,
come and get every shitty music album

203
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,080
you've ever sent over here,
especially Midnight Oil.

204
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,240
How do we sleep
while our beds are burning ?

205
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,840
Never mind that.

206
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,600
How do you dance
when your legs aren't moving,

207
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,960
you Aussie freak ?

208
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,880
Oh, but Australia,
we're just getting started.

209
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,440
We're also going to need you
to take back Rupert Murdoch

210
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,360
and Mel fucking Gibson.

211
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,960
And, yeah, we know,

212
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,520
Mel Gibson was technically born
in Peekskill, New York,

213
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,720
but you raised him,
so he's your fault.

214
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,520
Just put him in the cargo hold

215
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,880
with the other Australian celebrities
and garbage you've sent our way.

216
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,200
Oh, and as for
Hugh Jackman...

217
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,680
Steppin' out with my baby

218
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,760
Can't go wrong,
'cause I'm in right...

219
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,400
... we're keeping him.

220
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,200
He's delightful.
He can sing, dance,

221
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,200
you think
we're giving this back ?

222
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,000
You're fucking crazy.
Oh, and there's one more thing.

223
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,800
You see this koala joey
at the Los Angeles Zoo ?

224
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,800
You now have 49 hours
and 59 minutes

225
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,800
to get him out of here,
or we'll shoot him

226
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,400
in his adorable face.
Look at him.

227
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,480
He knows
what's about to happen.

228
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,080
Look into his eyes.
That's fear.

229
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,680
Pure koala fear.

230
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,880
Clock's ticking, Aussies.

231
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,320
So hurry up,

232
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,120
because time is running out.

233
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,080
Yipee-g'day, motherfuckers.

234
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,160
Moving on,

235
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,040
our main story tonight
is chickens,

236
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,640
basically turkeys
with eating disorders.

237
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,720
We love eating chicken
in this country,

238
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,040
so much so that we have to
produce a lot of it.

239
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,040
In the last 25 years,

240
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,040
the chicken industry
has doubled its production

241
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,960
and headcount from 80 million
chickens a week

242
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,000
to now about 160 million
chickens a week.

243
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,400
160 million chicks a week.

244
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,800
Those are
Warren Beatty numbers.

245
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,240
Those are Rob Lowe at the
St. Elmo's Fire premiere party numbers.

246
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,600
You know what ? Those are
clean-shaven Leonardo DiCaprio

247
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,600
on a yacht anchored outside
the Cannes Film Festival numbers.

248
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,200
That's a lot of chicks.

249
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,600
That's an unmanageable amount
of chicks.

250
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,080
We eat so much chicken,

251
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,880
it has become
our reference point

252
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,880
for what every other meat
tastes like.

253
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,040
This is pretty good.

254
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,240
I'm telling you, man.
It doesn't taste like lizard.

255
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
Tastes like chicken.

256
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,120
Raccoon is a delicacy in China.

257
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,920
I hear it tastes like chicken.

258
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,560
You know what alligator meat
tastes like ? Chicken.

259
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,880
What does it taste like ?
I really hate to say this.

260
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,320
It really tastes like chicken.

261
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,040
Armadillo tastes like chicken ?

262
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,640
Think about that.
That's amazing.

263
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,040
There is no parallel
for the other senses.

264
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,680
If I said to you, "Everything looks
like tables,"

265
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,880
or, "Everything feels
like Koosh balls,"

266
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,240
you'd think I was insane.

267
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,000
Now obviously, all of this
has been great news

268
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,000
for the poultry industry,
which is dominated

269
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,880
by four gigantic companies...

270
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,080
Pilgrim's, Tyson,
Perdue,

271
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,440
and Sanderson Farms.
And I know what you're thinking.

272
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,040
You're thinking, "Oh, this is
just going to be another story

273
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,240
about how horribly
chickens are treated."

274
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,200
And I know
we do hear about that a lot.

275
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,880
Chickens and turkeys
are arguably

276
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,840
the most abused animals
on the face of the planet.

277
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,720
You probably have no idea what goes
into making a bucket of KFC chicken.

278
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,320
Sadly, the main ingredient
is cruelty.

279
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,000
Okay, Pam, look,
let's be fair there.

280
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,080
The main ingredient
in KFC chicken

281
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,880
is not cruelty,
it's chicken.

282
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,920
The only thing where cruelty
is the main ingredient

283
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,560
is Child Stars.

284
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,880
It goes, cruelty, glitter, child,

285
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,160
and then statistically,
chicken.

286
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,160
And, yes,

287
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,880
chickens no doubt
can be treated terribly.

288
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,080
But that is not
what this story is about.

289
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,080
This is about chicken farmers.

290
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,920
And unfortunately,
this is going to be a lot less pleasant

291
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,960
than what you are looking at
right there.

292
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,240
Poultry companies would have you
believe chicken farmers have it made,

293
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,640
smiling in
their promotional videos,

294
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,200
always, no matter the company,
over the top of jangly guitar music.

295
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,880
It's a good feeling
to have a flock of birds

296
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,880
that are beautiful, healthy.

297
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,680
You know you've done
a good job.

298
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,280
The best product that you could produce
has just left your farm.

299
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,400
If someone
called me up tomorrow

300
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,560
and said, "Would you
be a poultry farmer all over again ?"

301
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,680
I would say, "Yes."

302
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,040
Sometimes I don't understand him
as well as I do the chickens.

303
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,040
Yeah.
Of course you don't.

304
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,240
Your husband is an adult human
with a vibrant interior life

305
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,880
awash in
infinite complexities,

306
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,880
and that
is just a fucking chicken.

307
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,640
So, yes,
it's easier to understand.

308
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,640
But despite those beautifully-produced
testimonials,

309
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,880
it turns out many farmers have
a very different experience.

310
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,320
I've had five heart attacks

311
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,560
since I've been
in the chicken business.

312
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,880
The struggle
has been very real.

313
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,880
And there's been
lots of nights

314
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,360
that we haven't slept.

315
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,000
It is kinda tough.

316
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,480
Not kinda tough.
It is tough.

317
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,520
And is has been tough
for a long time.

318
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,720
Multiple studies have shown
that many growers

319
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,800
whose sole source of income
was chicken farming

320
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,160
live below or near
the poverty line,

321
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,880
which sounds insane.
How can the people

322
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,160
who make the meat
we eat the most

323
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,680
barely be making a living ?

324
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,880
We eat chicken
when it's been popcorned,

325
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,200
when it's been fingered,

326
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,600
and when it's in Disney's
mouse-shaped nuggets,

327
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,880
which, incidentally,
is a little legally suspicious.

328
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,640
"Listen, there might
be mouse in these,

329
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,240
but we technically told you,
so you cannot sue."

330
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,360
This is all thanks

331
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,560
to a system
called "contract farming."

332
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,160
Contract farming
is basically chicken daycare.

333
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,080
Companies bring baby chicks
to an independent farm,

334
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,280
drop them off,
and pick them up

335
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,440
little more than a month later
when they're fully grown.

336
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,480
I'm assuming
that's how daycare works.

337
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,000
97% of chickens
are raised this way.

338
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,200
And when the chicken companies
describe it,

339
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,680
again over jangly
fucking guitars,

340
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,840
they make the system
sound great for farmers.

341
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,440
Tyson Foods actually owns
the feed in the feed bins,

342
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,240
and we actually own
the chickens in the house.

343
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,400
However, the properties,
the equipment,

344
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,200
the labor, everything around
the business on the farm

345
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,960
is actually owned
by the farmer.

346
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,600
You've got to hand it to them.

347
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,480
Jangly guitars simply make
anything sound more plausible.

348
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,560
Here, I'll show you.
Give me some music.

349
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,880
"Mickey Mouse Nuggets
take the finest chicken,

350
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,280
"no mouse, and cover it
with bread crumbs, no mouse.

351
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,200
"Our nuggets are the epitome
of mouse-less chicken.

352
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,800
One mouse."

353
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,880
But... see, it works.

354
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,400
But think about what that guy
actually just said.

355
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,800
You own the property
and the equipment,

356
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,160
we own the chickens.
That essentially means

357
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,360
you own everything
that costs money,

358
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,040
and we own everything
that makes money.

359
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,840
Because typically farmers
go into a great deal of debt

360
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,240
just to build chicken houses
and go into the business.

361
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,440
And the moment
you sign that contract,

362
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,240
the chicken companies
have a lot of leverage over you.

363
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,240
So all those horrible conditions
that chickens are kept in,

364
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,920
farmers might not care
for those either.

365
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,880
Bound by contract,
Craig is not even allowed

366
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,320
to give them sunshine
or fresh air.

367
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,960
If you get
that natural sunlight,

368
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,880
then the bird's more active,
and they don't want that.

369
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,640
They want them sitting down,
getting up, taking a drink,

370
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,520
a bite to eat, and sitting back down.
He gets fat then.

371
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,320
I absolutely would do away
with solid walls.

372
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,360
I would give them
back sunlight.

373
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,680
Letting sunshine and fresh air in
is number one, the birds love it.

374
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,640
And number two,
it's better for me.

375
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,880
Yeah, but of course chicken companies
won't let you do that.

376
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
They know that chickens
are like reality stars.

377
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,000
The happier they are,
the less money they're worth.

378
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,880
There is a reason
that E ! canceled

379
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,880
Keeping Up With
Alan And Arlene Alda,

380
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,160
Partners And Best Friends
For 50 Years.

381
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,440
And it's not because Alan
was too good a listener.

382
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,560
And the problem is,

383
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,400
as fast as farmers try
to pay down their debts,

384
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,880
companies can pile more on
by demanding

385
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,080
that they make
expensive upgrades.

386
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,480
The companies on a regular basis
come around and say,

387
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,360
"You have to do this
upgrade or that upgrade."

388
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,920
And if you don't, you're not going
to get chickens anymore.

389
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,920
"You've got to have this.
You've got to have that.

390
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,480
You've got to have this..."
You know.

391
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,880
It started out...
first, it was nipple drinkers.

392
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,680
And then it went
to tunnel houses.

393
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,080
And then it went to blackout curtains
on the south side.

394
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,880
And all this more stuff

395
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,960
ended up costing more
than our original buildings.

396
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,360
And that must be frustrating.

397
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,920
Farming chickens is like
hooking up with James Franco.

398
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
"Look, James, first you wanted us
to try nipple drinkers,

399
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,000
"which was weird,
but I put up with it.

400
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,880
"Then it was the tunnel house,
which was even worse.

401
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,920
"And now you want us
to try blackout curtains ?

402
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,920
"No, James, no !
I'm out. We're done, James.

403
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,720
We're done."

404
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,880
So if you think about it,

405
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,960
at this point, a farmer may
have borrowed over $1 million

406
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,800
for houses and improvements.

407
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
But they do this
because they're led to believe

408
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,880
that they'll have
a steady source of income.

409
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,440
Except that
they're actually paid

410
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,240
according to a tournament
or gladiator system.

411
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,240
And unfortunately, again,
it is significantly less adorable

412
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,920
than what you are looking at
right here,

413
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,920
because watch
one business journalist explain it.

414
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,120
The company takes,
you know, it could be as many

415
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,200
as 100 farmers in an area,

416
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,440
and then it ranks them
against one another.

417
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,800
Those in the top half
will get a bonus payment, extra money.

418
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,280
Those in the bottom half
will get a deduction,

419
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,280
they'll get
financially punished.

420
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,880
And what that means

421
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,200
is that you are competing
against your neighbors.

422
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,880
If they produce
fatter chickens with less feed,

423
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,800
your pay gets cut,
and not by a little.

424
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,200
You can be paid
nearly half as much

425
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,600
as other growers per pound

426
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,880
for reasons not entirely
within your control.

427
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,880
It's like an agricultural
Glengarry Glen Ross

428
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,880
or "Hengarry Hen Ross,"
if you will.

429
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,640
"ABC. A - always, B - be,
C - clucking !

430
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,840
Do it !"

431
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,840
And I do not apologize
for that joke.

432
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,640
I stand by it.

433
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,640
I stand by that... no, no, no.

434
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,960
You had your chance.
You didn't get onboard.

435
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,880
And, look,
losing a tournament

436
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,000
and being labeled
a bad grower

437
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,280
cannot just cost farmers
their home,

438
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,600
it can cost them
a lot more.

439
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,880
This past Monday morning
in North Carolina,

440
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,000
one of these bad growers
went out,

441
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,600
drove down a country road.

442
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,640
He was terminated
from his contract,

443
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,960
about to lose his home,

444
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,160
took a gun
and ended his life.

445
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,040
That's what we're talking
about here today.

446
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,800
This is personal.

447
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,880
It gets real
for poultry growers.

448
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,520
At this point, you may be angry
at the chicken industry.

449
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,720
But careful,
you need to leave a little room

450
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,880
'cause you're about to
get even angrier.

451
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,400
A chicken industry spokesman
was actually asked

452
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,400
about why so many farmers
live below the poverty line,

453
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,640
and this was his response.

454
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,680
Which poverty line
are you referring to ?

455
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,040
Is that a national
poverty line ?

456
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,760
Is that a state poverty line ?

457
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,040
Poverty line in Mississippi
and Alabama

458
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,880
is different than it is
in New York City.

459
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,400
What the fuck
are you talking about ?

460
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,800
It doesn't matter.

461
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,960
The poverty line
is like the age of consent.

462
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,920
If you find yourself
parsing exactly where it is,

463
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,240
you've probably already done something
very, very wrong.

464
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,600
And the thing is,

465
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,920
chicken farmers
can't even complain.

466
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,800
Because one of the reasons
that you've not heard about this story

467
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,840
is that to hear
farmers tell it,

468
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,920
companies take a hard line
with complainers.

469
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,200
Every time that I've spoken out
against the poultry companies

470
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,000
and the wrongdoings,
they retaliate

471
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,240
by cutting my pay,
cutting my chickens back,

472
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,640
cutting the quality
of my chickens that I get.

473
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,680
They're ranked one through 10.

474
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,360
Number one
is the best chicken they got,

475
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,640
number ten
is the poorest chicken coming off.

476
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,880
Sometimes based
on your mouth,

477
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,160
you'll get a lot of eight,
nine, and ten chickens.

478
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,880
Holy shit.

479
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,880
When controlling assholes
threaten their dependents

480
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,880
with numerically
inferior chicks,

481
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,760
that's not
a responsible business model,

482
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,760
that is Entourage.
That's what that is.

483
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,880
"Hey, if you ding
my Benz, brah,

484
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,880
"I'll have every girl in LA
avoid your dick

485
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,400
like it's
a fucking carbohydrate."

486
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,000
Can't wait for the movie.
I cannot wait for the movie.

487
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,400
It's gonna be sick.

488
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,200
It's gonna...
"The boys are back.

489
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,880
The boys are back.
The boys are back !"

490
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,480
And remember,

491
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,880
if you're given
inferior chicks,

492
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,320
you are going to suffer
in the tournament

493
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,120
and potentially
lose your farm.

494
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,400
Now the chicken companies
claim that they don't do that,

495
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,880
although I will note

496
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,480
that in researching
this story,

497
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,480
we've spoken
to a lot of farmers

498
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,880
who believe it to be real
and are terrified

499
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,360
of it happening to them.

500
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,440
A few years ago,
the Obama administration

501
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,440
tried to address
many of these problems

502
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,640
with new regulations.
They held town hall meetings,

503
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,040
and there was something
of a common theme.

504
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,920
Let me say
that numerous growers

505
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,720
are not attending
these workshops

506
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,720
because of being afraid of retaliation
on them by their integrator.

507
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,160
In the last 48 hours,

508
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,880
we've had growers
who have been threatened

509
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,520
not to attend this meeting
and not to speak out.

510
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,920
I represent
or help represent

511
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,640
650 chicken growers
in the state of Alabama.

512
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,840
And out of all the 650 of them,

513
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,920
there's two that was not afraid
to come up here.

514
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,840
I'm not saying I'm brave.

515
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,880
I'm saying I'm not...
I'm a proud American,

516
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,960
I'm a veteran,
and I need the right

517
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,000
to be able to talk
to y'all today.

518
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,040
That's...

519
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,880
... that is an impressive man.

520
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,880
Now if you worked
for the chicken industry,

521
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,880
you would have to
be an idiot

522
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,880
to stand up
in that room

523
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,680
and try
to defend your behavior.

524
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,880
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you an idiot.

525
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,080
Five years ago,
knowing what you know,

526
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,120
or at least I think
you must have known,

527
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,760
why would you
get into a business

528
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,600
that you feel,
at least from your comments,

529
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,160
is not a very good business ?

530
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,640
Wait.

531
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,920
"Why did you let us
fuck you over ?"

532
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,880
is not a defense
against fucking people over.

533
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,920
It just isn't.

534
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,240
And luckily, there was a farmer
in that very room

535
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,840
who was happy
to explain things to him.

536
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,160
My comment is directed
towards the gentleman

537
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,240
that said he wondered
why Valerie Ruddle

538
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,520
got into the business.

539
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,400
I can tell you the reason

540
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,880
why she got into it

541
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,680
is the company lied.

542
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,880
When you put numbers down
on a piece of paper

543
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,560
to get the bankers
to loan you the money,

544
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,960
and then
it don't follow through,

545
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,800
how do you
make bank payments ?

546
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,000
We've heard a lot
of information here today,

547
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,000
and I really didn't want
to get up here and speak.

548
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,760
But we really need
these rules.

549
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,920
And we need 'em quick.

550
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,880
"We need rules

551
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,320
and we need them quick."

552
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,160
You know
this guy is serious

553
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,560
because he's talking like someone
who just caught his roommate

554
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,760
masturbating
in the living room.

555
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,480
"House meeting !
House meeting !

556
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,080
"I know it's just
the two of us,

557
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,840
"but, Greg,
this needs to stop.

558
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,880
"House meeting now !

559
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,840
"Strike four, Greg !

560
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,760
Strike four on you,
Greg !"

561
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,880
Now the good news is,

562
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,880
protective rules
for poultry farmers

563
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,600
did actually get written.
The bad news is,

564
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,720
they are not currently
being enforced

565
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,960
because every year
since the rules were written,

566
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,160
a rider has been inserted into
the Agriculture Appropriations bill

567
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,480
that explicitly forbids
the USDA

568
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,320
from enforcing them.
And in recent years,

569
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,040
this effort
has been championed

570
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,840
by Representative
Steve Womack.

571
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,440
So why does he do this ?
Who knows ?

572
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,280
Maybe it's because
his home district

573
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,960
is the site of Tyson's
world headquarters.

574
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,760
Or the fact
that he's received

575
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,560
tens of thousands of dollars
in campaign contributions

576
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,960
from chicken companies.

577
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,760
Or maybe he's just sexually attracted
to chickens

578
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,880
and is jealous that farmers
get to spend so much time with them.

579
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,480
I don't know.
I'm speculating here.

580
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,600
The point is, he has fought efforts
to protect farmers.

581
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,840
Just last year,

582
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,520
Representative Marcy Kaptur

583
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,440
attempted to pass
an amendment

584
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,880
simply giving farmers
protection to speak out

585
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,880
without retaliation.
That was it.

586
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,400
And she made
a convincing case.

587
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,800
The Department of Agriculture
wants to enforce these regulations

588
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,200
so that farmers
have standing,

589
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,240
and that they don't have
their livelihoods taken away from them

590
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,560
simply because they're allowed to speak
about their conditions.

591
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,560
What is wrong with that ?

592
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,520
And what is wrong with that is that
the companies in this situation

593
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,560
have too much power.
Those doing the work in these houses

594
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,880
don't have enough power.

595
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,440
We need to give them equal standing
in the courts and in their ability

596
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,040
to come and see us and exercise
their rights of free speech.

597
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,480
Please support
this amendment.

598
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,400
Wow.

599
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,480
Wow, that is,
that is the kind of speech

600
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,880
that normally
has soaring music behind it

601
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,120
and precedes a come-from-behind victory
at the end of a movie.

602
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,600
But in real life,

603
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,360
this is what happened
immediately afterwards.

604
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,640
Please support this amendment.

605
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,560
Question is on
the Kaptur amendment.

606
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,720
- All in favor, say aye.
- Aye.

607
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,000
- All opposed will say no.
- No.

608
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,760
The "no"s seem to have it.

609
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,880
That is
the most depressing ending

610
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,880
since the Sex and the City movie.

611
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,200
"Oh, Big, Carrie ? Big ?

612
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,920
You're better
than that, Carrie.

613
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,200
If anything, you should have ended up
with Aidan.

614
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,800
Yes, yes.

615
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,600
Yes, Aidan was boring,
Carrie.

616
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,160
But guess what ?
So are you.

617
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,960
So are you, Carrie."

618
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,440
And look, I know this story
has been depressing,

619
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,440
and you might be wondering
what you can do.

620
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,520
I mean, you could
stop eating chicken.

621
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,080
But you're not
going to do that,

622
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,880
because chicken is delicious.
I'm getting hungry

623
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,880
just thinking about it now.
Here.

624
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,920
Delicious.
It tastes like armadillo.

625
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,200
You could say,

626
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,880
"Well, I'll vote against
Congressman Steve Womack,"

627
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,080
but you won't
because you don't live there.

628
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,080
And also,
for the last two elections,

629
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,880
he has had
no major opponent.

630
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,920
The only small satisfaction
I can give you

631
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,600
is letting Sean Connery
voice your feelings about Womack.

632
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,880
Womack !

633
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,800
Why am I not surprised,
you piece of shit.

634
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,880
Yeah, that helps a bit.

635
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,600
It helps a little bit.

636
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,880
It gives you a momentary
visceral satisfaction,

637
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,080
but it doesn't really
change anything.

638
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,840
But the truth is, there is actually
a glimmer of hope.

639
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,160
That same committee is set
to meet again next month,

640
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,720
and Marcy Kaptur
might again

641
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,880
try to pass a provision
protecting farmers from retaliation.

642
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,880
And if she does,
then let me use

643
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,880
the chicken companies' weapon
against them.

644
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,800
I'm talking, of course,
about jangly guitar music

645
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,840
to convince you that everything
I'm about to say is true.

646
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,480
Because listen to this.

647
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,640
There are 51 voting members
on the committee.

648
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,920
These are their names
and their states.

649
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,880
If your representative's name
is up there,

650
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,560
and they vote against
Marcy Kaptur's amendment,

651
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,920
it is because they,

652
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,880
and I cannot stress this enough,

653
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,200
are chicken fuckers.

654
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,960
They fuck chickens.
That's what they do.

655
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,040
Every day,
every which way.

656
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,520
And unless they want
that "chicken fucker" label

657
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
to follow them
for the rest of their lives,

658
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,880
they might want to think
extra carefully

659
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,880
about which way
they are going to vote.

660
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,200
Because "chicken fucker"
accusations

661
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,000
do not come off
a Wikipedia page easily.

662
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,880
Or if they do,

663
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,960
they tend to go
right back up.

664
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,560
Because chicken companies
may be able

665
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,920
to retaliate against farmers
for speaking out,

666
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,960
but they cannot prevent us,
as one,

667
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,560
from screaming "chicken fucker"
at the top of our lungs

668
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,040
if any of these people
vote against the farmers

669
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,440
in this tiny,
tiny amendment.

670
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,720
All potential
chicken fuckers here.

671
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,160
Don't be one of them.
That's all we're saying.

672
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,520
That's our show.
We are off next week.

673
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,640
But we'll be back
the week after that.

674
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,400
Good night !

675
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,240
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

676
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,840

End of episode 14
