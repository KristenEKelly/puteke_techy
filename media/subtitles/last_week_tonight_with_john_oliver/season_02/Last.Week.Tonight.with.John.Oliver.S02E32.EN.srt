LAST WEEK TONIGHT WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,000
Series II
Episode 32

3
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,760
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight" !

4
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,760
Thank you so much for joining us !

5
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,120
I'm John Oliver. Just time for a quick
recap of the week,

6
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,600
and we begin with Syria--

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,360
until 2011, a pretty nice name
for a baby girl.

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,200
The Syrian crisis
has been going on for years,

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,800
and this week saw the latest
attempt to intervene.

10
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,680
Secretary of State John Kerry
is trying to broker a cease-fire

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,320
between Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,120
and the rebels battling him.

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,840
Nearly 20 countries have
gathered in Vienna to do this.

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,760
Wow, nearly 20 countries

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,360
gathering in one alpine,
European country.

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,040
It's like the Winter Olympics,

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,920
but against all odds,
even more boring.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,680
Although I'll say,
for the record, one country

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,080
at the Syrian peace talks was
conspicuous by its absence.

20
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,040
There aren't any Syrians at the table,

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,400
here at these talks,
neither any representatives

22
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,640
of the regime, nor any representatives
of any opposition groups.

23
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,040
There were no Syrians there !
That's like holding an intervention,

24
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,600
but not inviting
the person who needs help.

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,840
Listen, I just thought
this would be a much more

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,440
pleasant evening
if Doug were not here.

27
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,800
He an asshole when he's drunk,
which he is all the time.

28
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,680
He has a massive problem.

29
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,040
And yet, it turns out
Syria's non-attendance

30
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,040
did not make things any less tense.

31
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,240
Apparently, the Iranian
and Saudi delegations

32
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,480
hate one another so much,
they were positioned such

33
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,760
that they never needed to make eye
contact, which is absurd.

34
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
The only things you should absolutely
have to position yourself to avoid

35
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,520
looking at are the sun,
an explicit photograph

36
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,080
of your grandparents making love,
and this actual photo of Carson Daly

37
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,080
dressed as Linus for Halloween.

38
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,040
He looks like Sloth from "The Goonies"
during a Medieval leech bloodletting.

39
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,720
Just...
Still, by the end of the talks,

40
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,920
John Kerry clearly felt they'd
made some valuable progress.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,080
I believe the diplomatic situation
is today more promising

42
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,240
than it has been in some time

43
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,920
because all of the stakeholders
came to this table.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,480
Wait, all the stakeholders ?
There were no Syrians there !

45
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,040
Could you not even find one ?
Paula Abdul is half Syrian.

46
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,680
How hard would it have been
to fly her out to Vienna

47
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,040
and put her in a chair ?

48
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,720
She might be good
at peace-summiting.

49
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,360
She made peace with MC Skat Kat,
and they were opposites !

50
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,120
They were complete opposites !

51
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,040
She's clearly got skills.
That's all I'm saying.

52
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,000
So, let's move on. Let's move on to
Ukraine, a nation that,

53
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,480
like the human appendix
and your Grandma Mimi,

54
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,040
you only really hear about
if something's gone horribly wrong.

55
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,480
Nothing funny has happened
in Ukraine for years now,

56
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,880
but they had local elections
across their country

57
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,600
this week, and they were
surprisingly entertaining.

58
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,800
The Star Wars
figure, Chewbacca,

59
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,400
showed up at a polling place
during elections in Ukraine.

60
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,360
He was arrested with a struggle
when he couldn't produce an ID.

61
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,000
In his defense, does he need ID ?

62
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,080
He's Chewbacca.
Where would he even keep it ?

63
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,000
Wookies don't have in-built pockets.
But it gets even better.

64
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,600
Not having ID was not
the only reason he was in trouble.

65
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,600
He was caught campaigning on behalf
of Darth Vader,

66
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,040
that's the main candidate of
the Internet Party of Ukraine.

67
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,560
And it's actually illegal to campaign
on Election Day in the country.

68
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,960
Yes...

69
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,720
Chewbacca was also accused
of illegally campaigning

70
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,520
on behalf of Darth Vader.
And if you are thinking...

71
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,760
Well, Chewbacca would never
campaign for Darth Vader.

72
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,040
In fact, the only time
Chewbacca even interacted

73
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,360
with him was in "Empire"
when Han and Chewy met up

74
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,960
with Lando Calrissian in Cloud City

75
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,720
and wandered into a trap
set by Vader and Boba Fett.

76
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,160
Well, first, let me just say,

77
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,600
I'm also glad
that high school is over.

78
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,040
I'm... It was rough, right ?

79
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,640
That was a rough time, right ?

80
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,440
But second... second, you're missing
the larger point here.

81
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,560
Darth Vader was actually
running for mayor in Ukraine,

82
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,000
and the arrested Chewbacca was,
frankly, not Vader's only hiccup

83
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,040
on Election Day, because not only
was he forced to wait in line,

84
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,120
he wasn't even able to vote !

85
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,520
Look, I'm sorry that Vader is annoyed,
but I think it's now obvious

86
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,400
that much of his intimidating presence

87
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,640
was in the original voice
because Darth Vader seems

88
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,280
much less powerful when he sounds like

89
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,720
an irritable Ukrainian man
working at a drive-thru.

90
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,040
And so, finally this week,
we turn to the United Kingdom,

91
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,480
where I am fondly known as "Who ?"

92
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,280
The UK's... That's so much
truer than you have any idea.

93
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,440
The... The UK's prime minister,
David Cameron, has had

94
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,040
a rough week, as he attempted to pass
a controversial tax credit reform--

95
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,040
controversial because of who it was
likely to hurt the most.

96
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,640
It's estimated around three million
low-income people will be affected

97
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,400
and many may lose up to Â£1300 a year.

98
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,040
Who will be hit ? Well, there's a very
clear answer.

99
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,240
Most of the pain will be felt
by working mothers.

100
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,680
That is obviously disgusting.

101
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,520
Not perhaps as disgusting

102
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,040
as that time David Cameron
reportedly stuck his dick

103
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,080
in a dead pig's mouth, but still,
still disgusting nevertheless.

104
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,000
The measure successfully
passed the House of Commons

105
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,160
but then hit an unexpected snag.

106
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,040
A major blow to the government

107
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,520
as its flagship welfare
reforms are defeated

108
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,040
in the House of Lords.
Peers say the tax credit cuts punish

109
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,160
the poorest workers unfairly.

110
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,040
Yes, the House of Lords
told David Cameron

111
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,600
he was being too hard on poor people.

112
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,360
A place that looks like this,
where lords and baronesses sit

113
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,080
on fancy red benches and a man wheels

114
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,560
a giant golden mace,
whose only practical purpose

115
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,040
appears to be smashing peasants,

116
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,680
a place with a member
whose actual name

117
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,040
is Lord Purvis of Tweed.

118
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,040
They, even they thought that
this smacked of class warfare.

119
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,560
Now, as the Conservative Party
realized the lords

120
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,040
might actually block their first
finance bill in over a century,

121
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,440
they started calling
in reinforcements.

122
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,440
Very, very packed benches
in the House of Lords today.

123
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,040
We can spot some conservative peers
like Andrew Lloyd Webber,

124
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,960
who we haven't seen in
for a very long time.

125
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,760
It's true.

126
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,480
Andrew Lloyd Webber,
seen here in his pajamas

127
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,040
despite having voted only 30 times

128
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,400
in the last 14 years,
flew in from New York

129
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,120
and voted in favor of cutting tax
credits for low-income families,

130
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,520
which must be one of the worst
decisions he has ever made,

131
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,800
right up there with using the name Rum
Tum Tugger for this character,

132
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,240
which sounds like what a cockney
alcoholic calls a hand job.

133
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,880
Now I should note,

134
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,720
I should note that
Webber denied having flown in

135
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,640
just for the vote, issuing a statement

136
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,640
saying he was there to attend
the opening night of 'Cats'

137
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,680
at the London Palladium
and to work with the cast,

138
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,000
which is clearly bullshit.

139
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,600
How do you work with this cast ?

140
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,320
They're adults dressed as cats.
What do you say ?

141
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,680
Okay, Jennyanydots,
when Bustopher Jones says,

142
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,560
'Toodlepip !' I really want
you to keep in mind

143
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,800
what Stanislavsky said
about affective memory.

144
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,600
And remember, try not to step
on each other's tails.

145
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,160
A-five, a-six,
a-five-six-seven-eight !

146
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,040
Act like cats. Act like cats
all the time.

147
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,960
I guess... I guess we should all
actually be thankful

148
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,040
that Andrew Lloyd Webber's vote wasn't
critical, not just for the sake

149
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,560
of low-income families in Britain,

150
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,520
but because it means we can
still be most angry at him

151
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,320
for giving the world a shaved,
shirtless, Donny Osmond

152
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,000
singing about Israeli children.

153
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,080
Children of Israel

154
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,520
Are never alone

155
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,160
That may be the worst
atrocity ever committed

156
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,880
against the children of Israel.

157
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,360
And now this.

158
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,960
And now, the inevitable sad
consequences

159
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,280
of morning show anchors
celebrating Halloween.

160
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,040
Halloween edition of "Daybreak."

161
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,560
We've all got just enough on
to really put us over the top.

162
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,040
Yeah. I'm Charlie Chaplin.

163
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,120
- Something along those lines.
- I've gotta get the gloves.

164
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,200
I've got some skeleton
gloves on, makin' it work.

165
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,920
I have another 365
to think about you in that.

166
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,600
in that Batman costume,
you hot little cookie.

167
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,920
- Thank you, thank you.
- I love it !

168
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,200
- Scary.
- I'll get you, my pretty.

169
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,040
Oh, my goodness ! Are you some kind
of headless person ?

170
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,400
- Who are you ?
- I'm a headless person.

171
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,680
You look so cute, Chasity !

172
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,920
- I'm super pumped about it.
- I know ! You're very excited !

173
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,400
I'm super pumped about
being dressed up today.

174
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,040
My equipment isn't working
as well, when you sit down

175
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,680
'cause I think it creates air pockets.

176
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,600
- Come on. Say hi, you guys.
- Okay, here we go.

177
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,840
- Look at this. Yay.
- Hi, guys. Guys, hi.

178
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,560
This looks like just a T-shirt.

179
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,040
Let's check in with Eazy-E.

180
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,840
Get a look at your roadways
this morning.

181
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,600
Good morning.
Some busy roadways out there,

182
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,520
and unfortunately,
we have this fatal collision

183
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
that's in the pickup stages
in Yolo County.

184
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,040
And now

185
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,040
Moving on, our main story
tonight, elections,

186
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,320
the only excuse
for a grown man to kiss

187
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,520
a stranger's baby
and not have the cops called.

188
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,560
As you may know, there is an important
election coming up.

189
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,120
We're just about a year away

190
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,720
from when American voters will
head to the polls and choose

191
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,320
the next president
of the United States.

192
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,800
Can Ben Carson actually win
the Republican nomination ?

193
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,000
Can Bernie Sanders
take Iowa and New Hampshire ?

194
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,520
The biggest question
right now is will

195
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
Vice President Joe Biden throw
his hat in the ring ?

196
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,480
Will Al Gore run for president ?

197
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,320
No, he won't.

198
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,400
And... Who gives a shit ?
It's still a year from now.

199
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,160
By the time it's done,
the 2016 election

200
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,080
will have lasted the entire
lifespan of a hamster

201
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,040
from birth all the way
to popsicle-stick grave.

202
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,840
We should not be talking
about the 2016 race

203
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,720
when America has
very important elections

204
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,760
taking place this Tuesday.

205
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,080
In just two days,
there are gubernatorial

206
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,640
and/or legislative elections taking
place in these four states.

207
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,280
And many other people will
be voting in local elections,

208
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,080
uh, or on important referenda,

209
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,720
like Washington State's
Initiative 1401,

210
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,920
which prohibit people from selling,
buying, trading, or distributing

211
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,760
parts of elephants,
rhinoceroses, tigers,

212
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,040
cheetahs, and pangolins.

213
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,640
And if you're wondering what a
pangolin is, let me show you.

214
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,960
The pangolin is
not very ferocious.

215
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,080
It doesn't even have teeth...

216
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,240
...and it's not very fast.

217
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,760
In fact, it has to wobble
on its hind legs and tail.

218
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,960
What is that ridiculous mess ?

219
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,160
It looks like the result
of a stegosaurus

220
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,640
making love to an artichoke.

221
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,520
And look,
if you're thinking right now,

222
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,200
Well, I don't live
in one of those four states

223
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,280
and I'm not a pangolin.
Why should I give a shit ?

224
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,040
Well, let me tell you, there are
American lives at stake here

225
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,040
because a number of these elections
could determine

226
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,040
whether hundreds of thousands of
people remain in, or even fall into,

227
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,040
what's known as the Medicaid Gap.

228
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,720
And I know that sounds
like a terrible clothing chain

229
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,920
where you can buy khaki hospital gowns

230
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,040
sewn by children in India,
but amazingly,

231
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,960
it's even worse than that.

232
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,320
Meet Cathie Owen, a Texas woman

233
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,680
who can't afford insurance,
has a family history

234
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,160
of colon cancer, and is desperately
saving up for a colonoscopy.

235
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,320
$8,000 stands between me and...

236
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,960
maybe another 20 years
of my life if I have colon cancer.

237
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:27,440
But I find myself now,
at 53, with grown kids,

238
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,960
in serious need of help.

239
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,720
Hard to ask for
but absolutely necessary.

240
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,040
That's just terrible.

241
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,680
$8,000 should not be the difference
between living or dying.

242
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,200
It should be the difference
between buying

243
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,080
this authenticated bass guitar
signed by Paul McCartney

244
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,400
and this baseball supposedly
signed by Kanye West.

245
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,280
And by the way,
why does that object exist ?

246
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,640
Is Kanye West interrupting
baseball games now ?

247
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,240
I'mma let you finish this pitch,

248
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,440
but my signature is the greatest
signature of all time ! Of all time !

249
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,040
And look, if your instinct is,

250
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,040
Wasn't Obamacare supposed to
solve this kind of problem ?

251
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,160
well, yes, you're right, it was.

252
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,040
To oversimplify things just a bit,
the idea was, under Obamacare,

253
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,720
people without insurance would
be split into two groups.

254
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,120
Those who made upwards
of 138% of the poverty line

255
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,600
would be eligible to buy
insurance with subsidies

256
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,000
up to a certain point.

257
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,040
And as for the poorest
Americans, Medicaid,

258
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,040
which had previously
generally applied to children,

259
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,440
their parents and the disabled,

260
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,240
would have been expanded
to include everyone else,

261
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,840
at which point, with everyone insured,
America was supposed to go outside,

262
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,840
brush the dead leaves
off the trampoline,

263
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,160
and celebrate with a backflip
and a broken tibia.

264
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,200
The Supreme Court even famously upheld
Obamacare in 2012.

265
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,120
What you may not remember
is that even that very day,

266
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,760
there were hints it may not have been
an unequivocal victory.

267
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,200
John Roberts sided
with the four Liberal justices,

268
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,520
voting five to four
to uphold nearly all

269
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,120
of President Obama's health care law.

270
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,360
And there's the problem,
because "nearly all"

271
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,040
is not a reassuring statement.

272
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,520
Health care is like
a pair of gym shorts.

273
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,520
Even if it covers "nearly all"
of what it's supposed to,

274
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,320
you're still left
with some problematic gaps,

275
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,680
and terrible things can happen.

276
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,680
Let me explain.

277
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,080
The Supreme Court struck down
the part of the law

278
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,560
which enabled the government
to force states

279
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,080
to expand Medicaid,
which meant states could

280
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,000
choose to reject the expansion.

281
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,160
Even though
that would be an odd decision,

282
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,640
under the law, the federal government

283
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,800
would pay 100% of the costs
for the first three years,

284
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,040
eventually decreasing to 90%.

285
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,360
And I can't think
of anything I would not buy

286
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,760
if I only had to pay 10% of the price.

287
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,760
"Fred Claus" on DVD ?

288
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,680
I mean, no thank you,
but yes, I'll take it !

289
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,880
Vince Vaughn is always good
for 49 cents worth of yucks.

290
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,040
Basically, for relatively little
of their own money, states could cover

291
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,480
all their poorest citizens.

292
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,040
It was an exceptionally
favorable deal,

293
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,720
but guess what
many states chose to do ?

294
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,680
Texas will not be participating
in Medicaid expansion.

295
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,040
They're working hard
to change the American Dream

296
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,160
into the European nightmare.

297
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,960
This system we call Obamacare

298
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,400
that we now see
is gonna be a train wreck,

299
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,720
and I do not want
the name of Mississippi

300
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,600
emblazoned across that train
when it leaves the tracks.

301
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,880
Would you consider
expanding a broken system ?

302
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,040
Of course not, of course not.
It's like a drug dealer.

303
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,720
You give 'em your first hit free,

304
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,600
and then they're hooked
for years and years.

305
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,920
Yeah... except in this instance,
that drug addict has cancer,

306
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,040
the drug being pushed is chemo,
and the corner boys have

307
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,520
seven years of fucking med school.

308
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,040
20 states have so far declined
to expand Medicaid,

309
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,040
leaving over three million people
in the Medicaid Gap.

310
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,000
People in the illogical
situation of not making

311
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,840
enough money to receive
government assistance.

312
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,360
Just listen to Lashombee Hoard,
a diabetic who at one point

313
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,920
was forced to reuse needles
to save money.

314
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,680
I don't make enough money
to get the insurance

315
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,200
through federal government,
and then I

316
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:13,600
I make too much to get Medicaid,
and I cannot afford the insurance

317
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,400
that's offered at my job, so...

318
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,360
I'm just... hanging in the air.

319
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,720
It's hard to explain
how disappointing that is.

320
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,040
Okay, the word "disappointing"
does not quite cover it.

321
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,200
"Disappointing" is your child dropping
out of college to be a street mime.

322
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,280
Gerald, your mother's
devastated !

323
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,280
Do not pretend you can't hear me
inside that glass box !

324
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,240
I know you can hear me, Gerald !

325
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,880
This kind of situation
is not disappointing.

326
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,360
It's fucking tragic.

327
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,040
The frequent argument
for states refusing

328
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,920
the expansion is they couldn't
bear the increased cost.

329
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,080
Although, it is worth noting
that to their credit,

330
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,640
even fiscally conservative
Republican governors

331
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,240
like Jan Brewer, Chris Christie,

332
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,360
Mike Pence, and John Kasich
did expand Medicaid

333
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,840
in their states, despite being
firm opponents of Obamacare.

334
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,400
I don't support Obamacare.

335
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,040
I wanna repeal it,
but I did expand Medicaid

336
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,040
because I was able
to bring Ohio money back home

337
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,160
to treat the mentally ill,
the drug addicted,

338
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,400
and to help the working poor
get health care.

339
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,920
Because you oppose Obamacare
doesn't mean when you have

340
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,480
an opportunity to bring these
$14 billion of Ohio money

341
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,040
back to Ohio, that's not Obamacare.
That's Medicaid.

342
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,000
You know what ?
Good for him. Good for him.

343
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,560
Although, it's a bit weird
when accepting billions

344
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,480
of dollars to give
health care to poor people

345
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,040
is somehow a brave and noble stand

346
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,720
when all Kasick technically
did was see a dump truck

347
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,040
full of money backing into his
driveway and just not say, "Stop."

348
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,160
All of which brings us back
to Tuesday's elections,

349
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,240
because in these three states,
they could determine the fate

350
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,600
of Medicaid expansion.

351
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,680
So, let's start with Mississippi.

352
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,120
Their incumbent governor,
Phil Bryant, opposes the expansion.

353
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,840
The good news is,
his opponent has promised,

354
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,520
if elected, he'll expand it.

355
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,640
The bad news is,
his opponent is this guy.

356
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,880
Political experts
in Mississippi were stumped

357
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,440
when the long-haul trucker, who ran no
campaign to speak of

358
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,040
and who was essentially
unknown outside his own home

359
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,240
was elected as the Democratic
nominee to be governor.

360
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,840
- Spent how much in this race ?
- Maybe $50, $60.

361
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,120
- $50, $60 on the whole campaign ?
- Right.

362
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,200
No signs in the yard,
no bumper stickers ?

363
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,960
No signs, no anything.

364
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,680
Gray's run for the nomination
was so low-key,

365
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,120
he forgot to mention it
to his own mother.

366
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,640
I called him and I said, "Robert,
you're running for governor ?"

367
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,080
And I was like, "No, he would've told
us," and she's like, "No, it's him."

368
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,960
Holy shit !

369
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,040
There is a difference
between running a low-key campaign

370
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,480
and not having name recognition
within your own family !

371
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,040
And if you're wondering how on earth

372
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,320
he got that nomination, well,
some people have a theory.

373
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,160
Some think it's simply because Gray's
name was the first on the ballot.

374
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,000
Others say it's because he has
a traditional man's name.

375
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,880
He is a male, and this is Mississippi.

376
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,040
"He is a male,
and this is Mississippi."

377
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,560
It's depressing when that's all you
have to say and everyone understands.

378
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,800
It was an attractive goat,
and this is West Virginia.

379
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,040
I get it. I get it.
I don't need any more details.

380
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,520
We're on the same page.

381
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,160
It pretty clear
at this point Robert Gray is

382
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,040
not going to be the next
governor of Mississippi,

383
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,800
so let's move on to Virginia,

384
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,000
where the obstacle to Medicaid
expansion is their state legislature.

385
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,040
For anything to happen,
Democrats would first

386
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,040
have to gain two Senate seats,

387
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,040
and one of the Senate's
leading opponents

388
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,040
of expansion is Dick Black,
whose name, yes,

389
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,360
sounds like a category heading
in an adult bookstore.

390
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,600
But believe me, he's considerably less
fun than his name suggests.

391
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:52,160
For instance, he once sent
a thank-you letter to Bashar al-Assad

392
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,000
commending him for
his extraordinary gallantry

393
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,040
in his war against terrorists,
a letter Assad posted

394
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,600
to his Facebook page
which I'd say was

395
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,680
the worst thing he'd ever
posted on social media

396
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,040
if it weren't for this
genuine Instagram photo

397
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,120
of his windshield on a rainy day,

398
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,720
which Assad actually tagged
"#Rain, #Morning, #photooftheday,

399
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,040
#bestoftheday, #instagood,
#syrianpresidency."

400
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:23,640
Assad abuses hashtags almost as much
as he abuses the Syrian people.

401
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,920
And by the way,
Bashar al-Assad is not alone

402
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,360
in getting surprising
envelopes from Dick Black.

403
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,800
Years ago, when he was
in the House of Delegates

404
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,440
and sponsoring
an anti-abortion measure,

405
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,040
he left envelopes on Senators' desks

406
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,160
with little,
plastic pink fetuses inside.

407
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,400
Well, that is revolting.
It almost makes you wish

408
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,280
that Dick Black,
who is running in Virginia,

409
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,480
was legendary accordionist Dick Black.

410
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,400
I'm sure he could find
a great campaign song

411
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,440
from his actual album,
"A Taste of Dick Black."

412
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,880
"A Taste of Dick Black."

413
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,320
Now, is that relevant to what we were
talking about ? Absolutely not.

414
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,040
But you cannot deny
it's a nice palate cleanser

415
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,280
after you just heard
the phrase "plastic fetuses."

416
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,640
But perhaps the most
striking election this year

417
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,400
is in Kentucky, where
they did expand Medicaid,

418
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,880
and by all accounts,
it has worked brilliantly.

419
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,120
Kentucky has seen
the nation's steepest drop

420
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,920
in the rate of uninsured residents.

421
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,040
Only an idiot would try to undo that,

422
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,840
which brings me to gubernatorial
candidate Matt Bevin.

423
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,320
He is being accused of
wanting to end the expansion

424
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,640
and kick people off Medicaid,
something he denies.

425
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,040
You're hearing things I'm supposedly
saying which I've never said.

426
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,200
I've never said I'm gonna
kick people off of Medicaid.

427
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,480
All right, okay, fine.
You never said that ?

428
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,640
Well, I presume that means
that this footage does not exist.

429
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,600
The fact that we have
one out of four people

430
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,240
in this state on Medicaid
is unsustainable. It's unaffordable.

431
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,040
So, if you were governor,
you would undo

432
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,200
his executive order
to expand Medicaid ?

433
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,240
Absolutely. No question about it.
I would reverse that immediately.

434
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,040
The only rational explanation
is that Matt Bevin has cloned himself,

435
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,120
and his clone, Batt Mevin,
is even stupider than he is.

436
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,080
And what makes his opposition

437
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,040
to government assistance
especially hard to take

438
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,680
is that he heads up
a family bell-making business,

439
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,720
whose Connecticut factory sadly burned
down a few years ago.

440
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,040
So, what did this staunch, small
government, free-market advocate do ?

441
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,320
Owner Matthew Bevin vows to rebuild,
and he may be getting some help.

442
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,080
Senator Blumenthal vows
to explore EPA grants for cleanup,

443
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,880
possible small business loans,
and potential resources

444
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,880
from FEMA and other federal agencies.

445
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,200
Your kind offer to basically form
Team Bell Town is critical.

446
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,840
Now, to be fair, Team Bell Town did
not receive federal assistance.

447
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,320
Bevin did, however, get a $100,000
state grant to reopen his factory.

448
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,040
So, if Matt Bevin ends up winning,
I presume he'll give you health care

449
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,160
as long as you cover yourself in bells
and set yourself on fire.

450
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,520
But the real irony here
is that Bevin did not have

451
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,400
insurance to cover the fire
because he claimed

452
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,640
No company would insure the buildings
for a price that made sense.

453
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,280
That's right, because
the cost of insurance

454
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,880
was too high, he needed to turn
to the government for help.

455
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,760
And quite frankly, Matt Bevin,
that should ring a fucking bell !

456
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,280
And yet as of right now,

457
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,640
his race is considered a toss up.

458
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,760
He could win just like
Dick Black could win,

459
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,360
and just like
Robert Gray definitely won't.

460
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,680
So, on Tuesday, even if you don't live
in a state holding an election,

461
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,760
spare a thought for the people who do,

462
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,040
because the results may
ultimately affect the health

463
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,560
of half a million people, and of
course, one ridiculous looking animal.

464
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,600
And now this.

465
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:50,840
And now, sweet Jesus, they've put the
weather forecasters in costumes too.

466
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,160
Now, there's no rain
in the forecast today.

467
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,040
We're gonna be dry.
But a little bit cold out there.

468
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,160
We have these temperatures
in the 30s in Kentucky.

469
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,000
Generally mild through the city
and surrounding areas.

470
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,680
Four in Airdrie,
six in Okotoks and in Concord,

471
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,080
Bragg Creek still a little bit cooler.

472
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,040
We also have a couple
showers that are moving

473
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,480
through Northeast Nevada,
cloud cover, some showers.

474
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,080
Could move up along the Idaho border.

475
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,040
Certainly an improvement
from a bit of light rain,

476
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,640
and even some freezing rain
that we saw come

477
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,240
across the region over the last
several days for some communities.

478
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,600
And here comes
the seven-day forecast.

479
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,320
And we got a high of 60 today,
56 for you tomorrow...

480
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,760
And lastly tonight,
we move on to China,

481
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,280
a 3.7 million square-mile
panda fuckpad.

482
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,320
China is one of the largest
countries on Earth,

483
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,760
and in recent years, they've seemingly
been trying to get even larger.

484
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,320
Satellite photos
of China gaining ground.

485
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,000
Island building to cement
its claim over disputed

486
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,080
territories in the South China Sea.

487
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,040
Whichever country plants
their flags on these islands

488
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,040
and reefs could control
considerable resources.

489
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,880
It's also one of the world's
busiest shipping lanes,

490
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,000
with over 10 million barrels
of oil moving through

491
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,000
the South China Sea each day.

492
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,040
It's true. China is
building man-made islands

493
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,240
to claim territory despite
several other countries

494
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,040
also claiming those islands.

495
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,920
Although, to be honest,
I'm pretty sure they are

496
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,720
all going to be unsuccessful,
and I'll tell you why.

497
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,440
Janice in Accounting
don't give a fuck.

498
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,840
The US emphatically
disputes China's tactics,

499
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,920
and earlier this week,
sailed a warship

500
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,720
just 12 nautical miles from one of the
islands, prompting this response.

501
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,040
The possible threat of war
against the United States

502
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,400
leveled by a top Chinese
military official...

503
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,920
According to Reuters,

504
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,880
Chinese Admiral Wu Shengli
in a video conference

505
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,920
with US Admiral John Richardson said

506
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,520
if the US continues
with those kinds of maneuvers,

507
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,560
there could be
a serious confrontation.

508
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,320
Quote, "or even a minor
incident that sparks war."

509
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,520
Holy shit.
We could be going to war with China.

510
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,080
Before you think
China shouldn't make

511
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,240
a mountain out of a molehill,
I will remind you,

512
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,040
they just made fucking islands
out of the ocean.

513
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,560
But before anyone panics,
I may have a possible solution here,

514
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,040
and it involves this man,
Grammy winning saxophonist Kenny G.

515
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,040
Let me explain.
Kenny G is a really big deal in China.

516
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,520
In fact, throughout the country,

517
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,200
his song, "Going Home,"
is piped into shopping malls,

518
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,560
schools and train stations as a signal
to people that it's time to leave.

519
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,280
Seriously. This has been happening
for years. Just take a look.

520
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,640
When I hear this song, it makes me
think of home.

521
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,240
I'm used to hear it.
I think it's great.

522
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:47,840
We usually start playing this song
at 16:30.

523
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,360
Do you know who the musician is?

524
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,640
I don't know.

525
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,880
Is he still alive?

526
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,680
What do you mean
is Kenny G still alive ?

527
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,360
Of course he is !
The G is an immortal being,

528
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,160
untethered from space
and time, floating endlessly

529
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,160
on an eternal wave of pure smoothness.

530
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,320
And frankly, is it any wonder

531
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,360
the Chinese people love
that song so much ?

532
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,600
Just listen to it.

533
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,680
Oh, that is smooth ! That's so smooth.

534
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,080
It's like wearing a mink coat
in a bathtub full of lube.

535
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,720
It's almost
impractically smooth.

536
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,760
Listen, Kenny G is clearly
our secret weapon.

537
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,640
He has an uncommon ability
to make the people of China

538
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,720
stop what they're doing
and go home to relax.

539
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,760
If we could only harness
that power of subliminal

540
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,040
suggestion for good, we could all live
in a slightly safer world.

541
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,040
So, in the light
of this week's events,

542
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,080
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome

543
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,880
the future winner
of the Nobel Peace Prize,

544
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,640
Mr. Kenny G !

545
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,320
China, I know you want these islands.
I know you want them real bad, China,

546
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,240
but I'm guessing you're
feeling a whole lot more

547
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,880
relaxed about the whole situation
right now, aren't you ?

548
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,080
And I'll tell you why you are,

549
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,840
'cause Kenny G is pouring liquid
velvet into your ears right now !

550
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,240
No one can start
an international incident

551
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,440
to this sound, can they, Kenny G ?
Can they, Kenny ?

552
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,920
No, of course they can't !
They can barely move !

553
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,840
This is like being shot with
a silk horse tranquilizer !

554
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,640
Anything else you'd like
to add, Kenny G ?

555
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,920
No ? I didn't think so,

556
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,600
'cause Kenny G lets
his saxophone do the talking.

557
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,080
And right now, it's telling everyone
to calm the fuck down !

558
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,720
That's our show !

559
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,240
Our thanks to Kenny G for bringing
peace to the South China Sea !

560
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,560
See you next week ! Good night !
Play it, Kenny !

561
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,240
Play it, Kenny !
That is so smooth !

562
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:35,720
That is so fucking smooth, Kenny !
Oh, yes !

563
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,680
It's like audio syrup !
Audio maple syrup !

564
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,000
I feel like I'm drowning
in full-fat milk !

565
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,000
