LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,360
Season 2
Episode 17

3
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,600
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,040
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

5
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,360
Just time for a quick recap
of the week.

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,560
And we begin
with Vladimir Putin,

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,160
the only man who misses the '80s
more than David Lee Roth.

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,360
For a year now,
the world has been waiting

9
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,880
for Putin to make his next move
regarding Ukraine.

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,440
And last week,
we got a dire warning.

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,440
Ukraine's president,
Poroshenko,

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,880
told his military last week
that it must be prepared

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,640
for a full-scale invasion
along the border with Russia.

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,440
He had earlier
said that summer

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,800
was the most likely time
for such an event.

16
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah, well, to be fair,
of course summer

17
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,000
is the most likely time.

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,880
Even the people
who live in Russia

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,400
don't want to visit Ukraine
in the winter.

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,880
But here is why
that won't happen.

21
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,920
Putin is notoriously terrible
at turning up on time.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,400
And if you need proof,
just look what else happened this week.

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,600
The summit between the Pope,
Pope Francis,

24
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,400
and Russian president
Vladimir Putin

25
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,800
off to a chilly start.

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,880
The Russian leader
was more than an hour late.

27
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,240
That is not cool.

28
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,080
It's not. It's not cool.

29
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,560
He kept the Pope waiting.

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,600
Just think about
how rude that is.

31
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,200
He forced the pope
to sit in there

32
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,400
for an hour, making awkward
small talk with God.

33
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,000
"What ? I don't know
where he is.

34
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,800
"Um, how have You been ?
Did You see LeBron's penis ?

35
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,800
"Did You see that ?
Of course,

36
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,000
"of course You did.
You probably made it."

37
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,600
But, look,
this was not a surprise.

38
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,160
Putin was once 14 minutes late
to meet the Queen.

39
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,240
He kept John Kerry waiting
for three hours.

40
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,040
And he has always
been this way.

41
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,040
His own ex-wife once said...

42
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,360
"I remember standing around
in the metro.

43
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,680
"The first 15 minutes of lateness
are OK, half hour also fine.

44
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,240
"But when an hour goes by
and he's still not there,

45
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,840
"you start crying."

46
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,200
Which sounds terrible.
Although, to be fair,

47
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,080
that's also how you could describe
an hour with Vladimir Putin.

48
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,680
But, either way,
it's ending in tears.

49
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,120
So,

50
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,680
what I'm trying to say is,
just relax, Ukraine.

51
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,480
'Cause if you were genuinely
expecting Putin to invade this summer,

52
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,320
just don't have your army
rush to the border.

53
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,720
Or if they do, tell them to bring
a fucking book with them.

54
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,880
But let's move on
to Azerbaijan,

55
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,920
a country
you think about so little,

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,680
you didn't even realize
that not only is that not Azerbaijan,

57
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,280
it's not even a land mass,
it's the Caspian Sea.

58
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,880
This is Azerbaijan.

59
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,880
I don't know when
I'm going to get tired of this game,

60
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,880
but it's definitely
not now.

61
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,800
Azerbaijan
has spent this week

62
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,040
attempting to get
the world's attention.

63
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,040
Well, the first-ever
European Games

64
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,040
have kicked off
with a lavish ceremony

65
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,240
in Azerbaijan's capital,
Baku.

66
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,440
6,000 athletes
from 50 countries

67
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,800
will compete
over the next two weeks.

68
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,680
Yes, the European Games
have begun.

69
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,920
And don't worry
if you've never heard of them.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,880
That's probably because they've never
taken place before.

71
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,960
But they're
definitely here now.

72
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,160
And they feature
20 heart-pounding events,

73
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,880
including men's
synchronized trampoline,

74
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,240
beach soccer,
and group aerobics,

75
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,880
the athletic pursuit
that answers the question,

76
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,880
"What if an orgy
was somehow platonic ?"

77
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,400
Azerbaijan has even
gone so far

78
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,880
as to create a pair
of ridiculous mascots,

79
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,720
Jeyran the gazelle
and a pomegranate named Nar,

80
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,120
who, let's be honest,
look like refugees

81
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,120
from an Azerbaijani
children's show

82
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,880
called Sexy Horse
and the Child Radish.

83
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,920
Now these games

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,600
have reportedly
cost Azerbaijan billions of dollars.

85
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,720
And they're largely seen
as a strategy

86
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,520
by President Ilham Aliyev

87
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,400
to boost
the country's profile.

88
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,880
And the good news for him

89
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,080
is people are now talking
about Azerbaijan.

90
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,920
The bad news
is what they're saying.

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,920
There's been a lot of criticism
of their human-rights records

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,160
and corruption, high-level corruption
allegations.

93
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,880
And that criticism
has really intensified

94
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,240
because of these games
putting Azerbaijan

95
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
very much in
the international spotlight.

96
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,000
And that was always
going to happen.

97
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,120
Azerbaijan demanding
the spotlight

98
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,520
is like GÃ©rard Depardieu
demanding to be filmed in high-def.

99
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,200
Why would you ask for that ?

100
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,000
Close scrutiny might not
be your best strategy here.

101
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,880
Unsurprisingly,
Azerbaijan has been trying

102
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,640
to prevent stories about how repressive
their regime is.

103
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,880
And they've been doing it in the most
repressive-regime way possible.

104
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,800
Dozens of foreign journalists
have been banned by the authorities.

105
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,200
The Guardian was banned.
We were banned.

106
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,600
Khadija Ismayilova,
an investigative reporter,

107
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,720
was arrested
after revealing corruption

108
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,200
among the president's family.

109
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,600
Look, Azerbaijan,
you cannot have it both ways.

110
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,960
You can't scream out to the world,
"Notice me ! Notice me !"

111
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,280
and then decide
to be a dick to journalists.

112
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,920
You're a country,
not Shia LaBeouf.

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,280
And finally this week,
we turn to Canada.

114
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,920
It's basically five hockey rinks
surrounded by bears.

115
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,880
The Canadian senate

116
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,960
has recently been reeling
from a political scandal.

117
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,880
The auditor general's report
on senate expenses has been released,

118
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,480
and it flags the accounts
of 30 senators.

119
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,280
Nearly $1 million in spending
has been flagged.

120
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,680
In some cases,
Canadians paid for senators

121
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,880
to go on golfing
and fishing trips,

122
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,920
even hockey tickets
and holidays.

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,120
Wow.
Hockey and fishing trips.

124
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,520
This scandal could not be
any more Canadian

125
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,880
if public money was used to get Drake
to drink maple syrup

126
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,000
on Niagara Falls.

127
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,080
Now this report
comes after roughly 18 months

128
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,680
of auditors examining
senators' expenses,

129
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,560
and they have uncovered
some questionable claims.

130
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,360
Former speaker Noel Kinsella

131
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,920
billed $5,600 to attend a funeral
with his wife.

132
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,760
Terry Mercer charged taxpayers
nearly $3,500

133
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,160
to attend
the 100th anniversary

134
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,160
of the Toronto Curling Club.

135
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,560
A man named Terry

136
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,000
going to a curling club
anniversary.

137
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,600
Kudos, Canada.

138
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,600
You made this scandal
more Canadian

139
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,600
after I explicitly said
that that could not be done.

140
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,000
Well played.
Well played, Canada.

141
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,320
And even though
those lawmakers

142
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,320
say they did nothing wrong,

143
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,720
$5,600 is still
a ludicrous amount

144
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,280
to spend
to attend a funeral,

145
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,640
unless you're going
to some kind of three-day

146
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,600
destination burial
in Barbados.

147
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,200
"Typical Sharon, making everyone
fly down here for this."

148
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,640
And yes, yes,
almost $1 million

149
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,240
of misappropriated
public money is not nothing.

150
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,080
But there was another number
regarding this story

151
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,840
which Canada might want
to take a close look at.

152
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,040
It cost $23.6 million

153
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,120
to conduct this audit,
which only found

154
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,080
less than $1 million
of questionable expenses.

155
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,880
A source tells Global News

156
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,920
auditors were brought
out of retirement

157
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,800
to complete
the 18-month investigation.

158
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,880
The cost of the audit
is so much

159
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,480
because of how thorough
auditors are being,

160
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
demanding receipts
for everything

161
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,880
from postage stamps
to breakfasts.

162
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,920
How the hell

163
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,720
do you spend
nearly $24 million

164
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,320
auditing stamps
and breakfasts ?

165
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,520
Canada, I think
you've forgotten what a scandal is.

166
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,880
And may I remind you
that Rob Ford,

167
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,120
your crack-smoking mayor,
is still currently sitting

168
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,320
on the Toronto city council.

169
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,240
But you know what ?
This whole audit was actually worth it

170
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,560
just to provoke
a single moment

171
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,240
with Senator Nancy Ruth.

172
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,720
Because watch her
angrily explain

173
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,920
why she expensed a breakfast
on a business trip

174
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,880
instead of eating the complementary
meal provided on the plane.

175
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,160
And they say
I should have not claimed

176
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,960
because I should have
eaten that breakfast ?

177
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,880
Well, those breakfasts
are pretty awful.

178
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,280
If you want
ice-cold Camembert

179
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,680
with broken crackers...

180
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,160
Now listen. Let this be
a lesson to all politicians.

181
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,200
It is hard to elicit
any kind of public sympathy

182
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,880
when you're uttering a sentence
that includes the word "Camembert."

183
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,040
Because even if
someone's yelling,

184
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,240
"Help !
I'm choking on Camembert,"

185
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,640
it still basically sounds
like they're showing off.

186
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,640
And now this.

187
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,120
And now, newscasters
trying not to swear.

188
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,920
One senior White House official
tells POLITICO Magazine,

189
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,920
"We know we're in for an expletive
storm if we lose the Senate."

190
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,360
Quote, "the most ludicrous
piece of pink expletive

191
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,840
they've seen all year."

192
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,920
And let me sanitize this,
"it really bleeps things up."

193
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,480
"If they don't step up by the end
of the year, bleep 'em."

194
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,440
"Bibi Netanyahu
is chicken bleep."

195
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,880
"You can put a cherry
on a pile of bleep,

196
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,520
but it don't make it
a sundae."

197
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,680
"You are a bleep.
You are a bleeping wet dog."

198
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,320
"I want to bleep
in your bleeping mouth.

199
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,200
I'm going to slap
your bleeping mouth."

200
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,360
"You're going to get
your bleep beat."

201
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,920
- What's the bleep ?
- I can't say that.

202
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,680
I tell you the head story,

203
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,280
you don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

204
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,000
Whoa, "bleep" !
What are you doing ?

205
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,480
AND
NOW

206
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,760
Moving on,
our main story tonight

207
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,480
concerns torture.

208
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,120
It's the thing that happens
to Mel Gibson in all his movies.

209
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,120
Help ! Help !

210
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,920
Help, please !

211
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,720
This little piggy
stayed home.

212
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,920
Wow, that is awful.

213
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,920
Although I will say,

214
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
the past decade
of Mel Gibson's life

215
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,280
has made those clips slightly
more enjoyable to watch.

216
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,520
Sadly, torture is not just something
that happens to Mel Gibson.

217
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,880
It's also been practiced
by the United States,

218
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,440
as President Obama
admitted last summer

219
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,360
in a bizarre manner.

220
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,960
In the immediate aftermath
of 9/11,

221
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,760
we did some things
that were wrong.

222
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,440
We did a whole lot
of things that were right.

223
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,280
But we tortured some folks.

224
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,320
That's a weird way
to phrase that.

225
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,720
You sound like you're quoting
a horrifying Andy Griffith episode.

226
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,440
"You see, Opie,
things got a little out of hand

227
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,520
"down at the jail house,
and Barney and I ?

228
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,880
"Well, we tortured
some folks.

229
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,120
"We tortured
those folks good, Ope."

230
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,320
The president's comments
were triggered

231
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,960
by the Senate Intelligence
Committee's massive 6,700-page report

232
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,880
on the CIA's detention
and interrogation program.

233
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,200
The full report
remains classified,

234
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,400
but a 500-page summary
was released in December.

235
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,200
And it's even
actually available on Amazon.

236
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,920
And you should get a copy,

237
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,880
especially if you're looking
for a truly terrible book-club pick.

238
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,320
Because this has got to be
right up there

239
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,240
with a lawnmower-repair manual

240
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,240
or Bill Cosby's memoir,
Time Flies.

241
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,440
You know when time
really flies ?

242
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,240
When you lose consciousness
for three hours

243
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,920
and wake up
in Bill Cosby's limo.

244
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,560
But that's not the point.
That's not the point.

245
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,200
The point is,
clearly most people

246
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,800
have not read this summary.

247
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,400
That's not
particularly shocking.

248
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,240
What is shocking
is that many of those

249
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,080
actually involved
in the programs,

250
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,280
even former director
of the CIA Porter Goss,

251
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,000
have not read it either.

252
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,760
I have not read a word
of the report.

253
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,000
I have not read
a word of any of this stuff.

254
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,280
How have you
not read it ?

255
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,560
You're fucking in it
81 times.

256
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,040
Spoiler alert,
sorry, spoiler alert.

257
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,760
You can do it, though.

258
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,560
Just knock out
a chapter a night.

259
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,680
And if you can't find the time
to sit down and read it,

260
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,800
don't worry, we've made
an audio-book version

261
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,600
with Academy Award-winning
actress Helen Mirren

262
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,120
reading the report for you.

263
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,360
And I'm not kidding
about that.

264
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,240
She did it for us.
Take a listen.

265
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,600
The CIA placed individuals with no
applicable experience or training

266
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,920
in senior detentions
an interrogation roles...

267
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,280
Yes, that's the actual
Helen Mirren

268
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,400
reading the report
that you should have already read

269
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,880
for you, Porter Goss,

270
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,600
so put it on in your car
and fucking listen to it.

271
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,880
And look,
I know no one,

272
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,960
no one wants to read this
or talk about what's in it.

273
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,400
But there are
a few things in here

274
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,400
that we all should
really grapple with.

275
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,400
Because as a recent poll
revealed,

276
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,320
a lot of us may have some dangerous
misconceptions about torture.

277
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,240
69% of Americans told us

278
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,120
they consider waterboarding
to be torture,

279
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,160
but nearly half, 49%,

280
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,880
said such tactics
are sometimes justified.

281
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,440
And more than half, 57%,

282
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,880
said these
interrogation techniques

283
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,880
often or sometimes provide
reliable information

284
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,320
that can help prevent
terror attacks.

285
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,200
57% of us are confident
that torture works.

286
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,680
That is a lot.
According to one poll,

287
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,000
only 46% of Americans
are confident

288
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,200
in the Big Bang Theory.

289
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,600
Which is crazy,
because that is literally

290
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,200
explained to us every week
in the opening credits

291
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,480
of The Big Bang Theory.

292
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,560
And sadly, there is no sitcom theme
that explains torture to us,

293
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,360
at least,
not since they canceled

294
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,360
Two Guys, A Girl,
and Black Site Prison.

295
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,920
And if you're thinking,

296
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,720
but why are we talking about this now ?
Didn't we pass a law

297
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,480
banning all those enhanced
interrogation techniques ?

298
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,200
Well, it turns out,
no, we didn't.

299
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,120
We checked, and the only restrictions
put in place

300
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,920
were by an executive order
President Obama signed in 2009

301
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,960
requiring interrogations to follow
the Army Field Manual.

302
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,800
And that's it.

303
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,320
And executive orders
can be instantly overturned

304
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,040
as soon as a president
leaves office.

305
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,320
Think about that.

306
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,200
That means
President Lindsey Graham

307
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,920
could undo that
on his first day in office.

308
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,120
To be honest, that just seemed like
a nice thing to do for him.

309
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,160
He can put that image in a frame
and he can look at it

310
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,400
while he's not being president
for the rest of his life.

311
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,200
So... But let's look
at the report together,

312
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,920
because it challenges
a lot of the assumptions in that poll.

313
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,240
First, we did a lot more
than just waterboarding.

314
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,480
We learn that one CIA officer
played Russian roulette

315
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,880
with a detainee.

316
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,880
Another threatened a detainee
with a gun and a power drill.

317
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,520
We learned
at least five detainees

318
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,120
were subjected to so-called
"rectal rehydration,"

319
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,000
or feeding through the rectum
with no medical necessity.

320
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,960
Yes, forced rectal rehydration.
And the details of that,

321
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,880
in a footnote of this report,
are so graphic,

322
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,160
not even Helen Mirren
can make them sound appealing.

323
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,280
Majid Khan's 'lunch tray'

324
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,400
consisting of hummus, pasta
with sauce nuts and raisins

325
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,640
was 'pureed' and rectally infused.

326
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,600
Just try
not to think about that

327
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,880
the next time you eat hummus.

328
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,800
In fact, I feel that I should
preemptively apologize

329
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,800
to the Sabra hummus brand,

330
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,080
because your sales
are about to drop quite noticeably.

331
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,080
And it doesn't stop there.

332
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,880
The report also cites
the tragic case of Gul Rahman,

333
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,160
a completely innocent man
picked up in a case

334
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,280
of mistaken identity who was shackled
to the wall of his cell

335
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,400
and later found dead,
likely from hypothermia.

336
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,880
Now at this point,
we could all probably do

337
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,200
with hearing Helen Mirren
reading something

338
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,920
a little more pleasant.
Maybe some Beatrix Potter.

339
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,360
Flopsy, Mopsy and Cotton tail,
who were good little bunnies,

340
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,480
went down the lane
to gather blackberries.

341
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,480
Oh, thank you, Helen.
That's so much nicer.

342
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,280
Please tell me more
about the bunnies.

343
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,600
But while Flopsy, Mopsy and Cotton-tail
were on their way to pick blackberries,

344
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,360
Peter was chained to a wall
in Farmer McGregor's basement.

345
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,960
He'd been badly beaten,

346
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:52,200
and a tray of carrots and raisins
was pureed and rectally infused.

347
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,000
Helen Mirren !

348
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,200
I'm going to say what everyone
has thought about you for years.

349
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,280
You're a monster !

350
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,440
And, look, you may think,
as 57% of you evidently do,

351
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,720
that at least
those tough techniques

352
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,320
provided us
with reliable intelligence.

353
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,200
Well, not so much.

354
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,160
The report's
most damning conclusion

355
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,560
is that the tactics
were ineffective,

356
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,760
despite the CIA's claim
that 20 detainees

357
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,320
subjected to them
shared crucial information,

358
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,920
some of which led
to Osama Bin Laden.

359
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,120
Our staff reviewed
every one

360
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,880
of the 20 cases.

361
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,880
And not a single case
holds up.

362
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,320
Yeah, torture
is one of those things

363
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,640
that is advertised as something
that works, but doesn't,

364
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,240
like a Ford truck,
or those weird bottles

365
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,000
of Horny Goat Weed available
at your local bodega.

366
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,600
But maybe the reason
that so many of us

367
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,840
innately believe
that torture works is because it does,

368
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,040
on TV, all the time.

369
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,840
Look at 24. Jack Bauer repeatedly
saved American lives

370
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,800
while behaving like this.

371
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,320
You're going to tell me
what I want to know,

372
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,120
or you're going to start
losing your fingers one by one.

373
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,240
Where is the nerve gas ?

374
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,960
You are going to tell me !
What is happening at 8:00 ?

375
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,880
You probably don't think that I could
force this towel down your throat.

376
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,880
But trust me, I can.

377
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,880
Emmy for best drama, 2006.

378
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,800
Beat The Sopranos.
Great show.

379
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,440
And look,

380
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,480
look, torture works on 24
and in movies

381
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,880
because it has to.

382
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,440
It's a dramatic device
to move the plot along.

383
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,520
But ask terror experts
and they'll tell you

384
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,520
it's one of those movie tropes

385
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,520
that's got no basis
in real life,

386
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,320
like a wedding
being interrupted,

387
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,640
or someone this handsome
feeling sad,

388
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,880
or this character
being part Asian.

389
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,320
It works because
they just say it does,

390
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,400
and we're supposed
to take it.

391
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,400
And yet,
even supposedly smart people

392
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,880
like Antonin Scalia,

393
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,680
an ill-tempered bullfrog
in a robe,

394
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,880
they cite 24 as evidence
that torture could be justified.

395
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,960
He said...

396
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,800
"Jack Bauer saved Los Angeles...

397
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,400
"He saved
hundreds of thousands of lives...

398
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,960
"Is any jury
going to convict Jack Bauer ?

399
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,520
"I don't think so."

400
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,280
And look, Justice Scalia,

401
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,280
just because Kiefer Sutherland
does something on camera

402
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,280
does not mean
it's a great idea,

403
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,880
unless, of course,
that thing is him

404
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,640
drunkenly running
into a Christmas tree.

405
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,920
That would explain everything.

406
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,200
Yes, yes.

407
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,000
On December 25th,

408
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,520
we should no longer
celebrate the birth of Christ.

409
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,840
We should celebrate that.

410
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,920
And, look, it's clearly
not all 24's fault.

411
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,240
Some people continue
to insist that our tactics saved lives,

412
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,120
citing two particular cases.

413
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,280
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed

414
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,440
and Abu Zubaydah

415
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,520
provided
the overwhelming majority

416
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,120
of reports on Al-Qaeda.

417
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,080
Both of them
were uncooperative at first.

418
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,960
The application of enhanced
interrogation techniques,

419
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,760
specifically waterboarding,

420
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,320
especially in the case
of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,

421
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,760
is what really persuaded him
he needed to cooperate.

422
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,760
Look, I know
what you're thinking,

423
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,320
that is a reasonable statement
from a famously reasonable man.

424
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,040
But let's just
look at those two examples.

425
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,840
First Abu Zubaydah.

426
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,720
The CIA have claimed
that subjecting him

427
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,480
to enhanced interrogation
disrupted two plots.

428
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,680
But it turns out,
he disclosed those plots

429
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,760
before he was waterboarded.

430
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,360
And the report
now tells us

431
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,880
that they were judged
to be "infeasible", those plots,

432
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,720
and in one case
"hilariously infeasible."

433
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,920
Because it concerned
two would-be terrorists

434
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,520
who had, and this is true,

435
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,880
proposed a plot based on
a satirical Internet article

436
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,120
entitled How to Make an H-bomb,

437
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,480
which instructed people
to enrich uranium

438
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,640
"by placing it in a bucket
attaching it to a six foot rope,

439
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,480
"and swinging it around your head
as fast as possible for 45 minutes."

440
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,440
And we all know,
that is not how to make an H-bomb,

441
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,120
that is the brewing process
for Bud Light Lime.

442
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,560
That's a fact.
That is just a scientific fact.

443
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,760
It's how they do it.

444
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,200
Now,

445
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,400
as for
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,

446
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,840
he did give us information

447
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,880
after he was waterboarded.
That's true.

448
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,360
But it's worth noting

449
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,880
the quality of that information.

450
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,520
He told investigators

451
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,360
that he had sent
Abu Issa al-Britani to Montana

452
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,680
to recruit
African-American Muslim converts.

453
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,680
The FBI scrambles,

454
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,120
launches a massive investigation
in Montana

455
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,920
trying to find these supposed
black Al-Qaeda operatives.

456
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,680
But the FBI found nothing.

457
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,000
KSM was lying.

458
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,920
Yeah. Of course he was lying.

459
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,880
What part of the phrase, "recruiting
African-American Muslims in Montana"

460
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,840
did not make you
call "bullshit" instantly ?

461
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,720
Even this week,
we've learned

462
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,880
that the most famous
black person from Montana

463
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,120
may actually be white.

464
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,800
And, look, none of this,

465
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,800
none of this is to say

466
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,240
that we don't
need information from detainees.

467
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,040
But if you want
to see how to get it without torture,

468
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,880
just watch a former FBI agent,
Jack Cloonan,

469
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,120
who worked
in the Bin Laden unit,

470
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,920
show you how it's done.

471
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,160
You want to be able
to build a rapport with somebody.

472
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,080
You are their salvation.

473
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,960
Because their life
as they know it is over.

474
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,680
"Is there something
I can do for your kids ?

475
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,480
"You concerned about them ?

476
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,480
"You want them educated ?
I'll get them educated.

477
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,880
"What do you want ?

478
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,880
"Tell me what you want.

479
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,200
"Script for me
your exit strategy.

480
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,720
"How do you extricate yourself
from this terrible situation,

481
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,320
"by the way,
that you put yourself in ?

482
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,920
"Now you can't go back home.

483
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,880
"Can you ?
No, so let's make peace with that.

484
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,040
"Let me help you
find the strategy

485
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,880
"to give you a life."

486
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,880
Holy shit.

487
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,920
I would tell that man
any of my secrets.

488
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,240
"The fun name I have for my glasses
is Fixy McPeepers.

489
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,920
"I once tried to bleach my anus
with Crest White Strips.

490
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,920
"Every day at 2 p.m.
I cheer myself up

491
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,160
"by silently eating four marshmallows
from a bag at my desk,

492
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,280
"and I call it
a marshmallow party.

493
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,880
"Please stop looking at me !

494
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,880
"I'll tell you anything !"

495
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,640
So look,
there is no proof

496
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,440
that torture does any good,
but there is real proof

497
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,160
that it does serious harm
to America's image overseas.

498
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,000
References to American torture
show up everywhere,

499
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,840
from terrorist
recruiting tools

500
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,120
to statements
from North Korea,

501
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,880
who've called our techniques
"brutal medieval."

502
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,920
And the most insulting thing
about that

503
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,880
is that knowing them,
they probably meant it as a compliment.

504
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,600
And the problem is,
the rules we have on the books

505
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,560
to stop us from returning
to the dark days of torture

506
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,480
are in one easily-reversible
executive order.

507
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,360
Now as it happens,
John McCain and Diane Feinstein

508
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,880
have proposed an amendment
due up for a vote next week

509
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,720
which puts
the most basic parts

510
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,880
of the president's
executive order into actual law.

511
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,200
And we should pass that,
because if we don't,

512
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,880
there is no guarantee
that the next president

513
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,760
will uphold the ban.

514
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,680
In fact, we asked
all 14 declared candidates

515
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,880
whether they would consider
overturning the president's order,

516
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,080
and only four of them
told us definitively

517
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,280
that they would
definitely keep it in place.

518
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,320
As for the rest,
they either ignored us

519
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,120
or avoided
answering directly,

520
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,840
which is very frustrating

521
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,600
because we need
that information badly from them.

522
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,960
And the problem is,
we can't torture them to get it

523
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,360
because as this report
more than proves,

524
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,600
that doesn't fucking work !

525
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,200
And look, look,

526
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,400
here's the thing.

527
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,480
If enhanced interrogation
were not torture, which it is,

528
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,960
and even if torture did work,
which it doesn't,

529
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,160
America should not
be a country that tortures people.

530
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,880
Because it is brutal,
it is medieval,

531
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,520
and it is beneath us.

532
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,000
And when the rest of the world
thinks about America,

533
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,000
they should not
think of this.

534
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,160
Because that's not
what this country's about.

535
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,400
They should be thinking
about this.

536
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,480
That would
explain everything.

537
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,640
Yes.

538
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,360
There is nothing
more American

539
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,760
than a drunk man
jumping into a Christmas tree.

540
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,920
And now this.

541
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,880
And now, newscasters
not trying not to swear.

542
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,400
These are good,
decent, steady men

543
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,200
that don't go around
flipping people off

544
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,200
or screaming "fuck you"
at the top of their lungs.

545
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,080
I suggest that...

546
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,600
He taught me
how to count change.

547
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,960
He taught me how
to make sausage.

548
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,840
He taught me how
to fuckin' wake up...

549
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,400
This chick is so batshit,
I mean, excuse me !

550
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,280
Bat... you know what.
Excuse me.

551
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,240
You know, you do that one more time,
you're fuckin'...

552
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,240
You shouldn't be...
oh, shit !

553
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,080
Why'd he stop ?

554
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,920
- We shouldn't be talking about it.
- Exactly.

555
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,400
- It's a stupid fuck, a stupid debate.
- Wow, did you...

556
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,880
We're only acting here
and putting on shit. We have nothing...

557
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,720
Welcome back to Hardball.

558
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,320
AND
NOW

559
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,600
And finally tonight,

560
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,000
just a quick update
on Jack Warner,

561
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,320
the former
FIFA vice president

562
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,920
currently under investigation
for allegedly taking

563
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,720
a $10 million bribe.

564
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,880
Last week, we responded
to his televised message to Trinidad,

565
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,440
The Gloves Are Off,

566
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,720
by buying airtime
on the same network

567
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,400
to deliver our response...
The Mittens of Disapproval Are On.

568
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,920
It actually aired
in Trinidad and Tobago

569
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,600
on Tuesday night.

570
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,640
And it left Jack Warner
with two choices,

571
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,560
one, completely ignore it

572
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,960
and focus on preparing
his legal defense,

573
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,040
or two, do this.

574
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,360
I don't need any advice
from any comedian fool

575
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,800
who doesn't know anything
about this country

576
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,120
to tell me what files to release
or what not to release

577
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,040
That is none of his bussiness
and I take no instructions from him.

578
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,320
Wait, wait !

579
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,880
Wait.

580
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,920
"Comedian fool" ?

581
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,920
That's not an insult,
that's literally my business card.

582
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,880
I've got to say,
if you really want to insult me,

583
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,440
you've got plenty
to work with here.

584
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,040
Why not say I look like the reflection
of Harry Potter in a doorknob ?

585
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,880
Come on,
I'm doing your job for you.

586
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,720
And second,
I have to ask,

587
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,120
what was that music
behind you ?

588
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,880
We didn't add that,
it was in the original.

589
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,880
And believe me,
it continued to build.

590
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,840
I don't take instructions
from an American

591
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,640
at this point in time.

592
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,320
The point
I want to make to you however

593
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,840
is however much
we may disagree as a people

594
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,600
however much
we may fight among ourselves

595
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,080
we do it among ourselves
within our borders.

596
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,800
But against outsiders,
we have to stand united.

597
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,880
Oh, he is really good
at making videos.

598
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,120
Because that music
makes anything sound better.

599
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,320
We looked it up,
and it's a song called Ash.

600
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,520
And if you're wondering
how we found it,

601
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,120
it turns out, this is true,

602
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,960
if you type the phrase, "epic
and dramatic music" into Google,

603
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,160
it's the first result
that pops up.

604
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,160
It's the first one !

605
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,560
I will tell you one thing

606
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,200
that Jack Warner
is definitely not guilty of,

607
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,920
and that is overthinking
his music choices.

608
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,320
And listen, listen, Trinidad,

609
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,440
I am sorry
you got dragged into this.

610
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,440
You're an amazing country.

611
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,400
Tobago, not so much.
But the point is,

612
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,000
the point is, I am sorry
you got caught in the crossfire here,

613
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,960
because this should be
between me and Jack Warner.

614
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,600
So I'd like to give him
another message, if you don't mind.

615
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,360
Mr. Warner,
we meet again, old friend.

616
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,760
It is I, the comedian fool.

617
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,840
Jack, we're a lot alike
you and I.

618
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,880
We both know this particular music
makes anything we say

619
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,760
sound a lot more impressive
than it actually is.

620
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,880
And we both have our flaws.

621
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,400
People have said
I'm not a good listener, for example.

622
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,720
Just as I've said
that you diverted $750,000

623
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,640
in Haiti-relief funds
into a bank account you controlled.

624
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,520
And sure, we may both
dispute those charges,

625
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,920
but my point is,
neither of us is perfect.

626
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,280
And so to you,
I say this, Jack,

627
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,880
if you really want to continue
to trade shit-talking videos

628
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,920
with increasingly high
production elements,

629
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,560
then consider your challenge
accepted, my friend.

630
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,600
Because you have
magnificent music under yours.

631
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,240
Well played.

632
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,240
Well, I see your music choice
and I raise you fire !

633
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,000
Your move, Jack !
Your move !

634
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,600
Either respond to me
by this time next week

635
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,720
with a more spectacular
video than this,

636
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,640
or I will accept
your graceless defeat.

637
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,880
That's our show !

638
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,120
Our thanks to Helen Mirren !

639
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,880
Good night !

640
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,960
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

641
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,560
Season 2
End of episode 17
