00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,440
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,480
SEASON II, EPISODE 11

3
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,160
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,080
Thank you for being with us.
Time for a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,880
We're going to begin with Armenia.

6
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,400
They marked the 100th anniversary of
the beginning of Armenian genocide,

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,400
when as many
as 1.5 million people died.

8
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,000
You probably heard
about this story already,

9
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,560
because it's been all over the news
for an unexpected reason.

10
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,080
Kardashians are in the country
to tape their reality show

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,880
and pay tribute
to victims of Armenian genocide.

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,560
Kim and Kanye
did spend time commemorating

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,520
the 100th anniversary
of the Armenian genocide.

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,160
What is important in Armenia
this month ? What's the significance ?

15
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,960
It's the genocide thing
that's happening...

16
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,080
- How do you know that ?
- Because of the Kardashians.

17
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,040
God !

18
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,480
The only reason I know
about chemical warfare in Syria

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,520
is because
of "Vanderpump Rules."

20
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,440
And that's only
because I happened to Google,

21
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,320
"is there anything worse
than Vanderpump Rules ?"

22
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,440
and it was the only
thing that came up.

23
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,360
The Armenian genocide
is a controversial subject,

24
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,400
especially in Turkey,
where the government believes

25
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,440
the actions of Ottoman Turks
do not merit the term "genocide."

26
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,080
However, not only do historians
and at least 25 countries

27
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,440
believe it to be a genocide,
but so does an unlikely coalition.

28
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,960
Turkey has condemned
the Russian president Vladimir Putin

29
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,680
for calling the Armenian
massacre "genocide."

30
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,560
The Pope called it a genocide.
George Clooney called it a genocide.

31
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,320
Putin, the Pope, and Clooney !

32
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,080
Okay, for a start:
kill, marry and fuck, respectively.

33
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,120
That's the easiest round
of that game I've ever played.

34
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,960
That was very easy.

35
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,800
Secondly: if all those people say
it is a genocide, who says it isn't ?

36
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,480
The White House
has called it a mass atrocity

37
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,840
but President Obama has stopped short
of using "genocide."

38
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,200
If you're wondering
why he stopped slightly short,

39
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,960
it's because Turkey
is an absolutely vital ally.

40
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,360
To avoid upsetting them, the president
consulted his diplomatic thesaurus.

41
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,000
Genocide ? Can't say that.
Snafu ? That's too glib.

42
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,720
Big big murder party ?
That's warmer...

43
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,800
Armenia's terrible, horrible, no good.
Very bad day ? Let's go with that !

44
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,960
Still, President Obama being afraid
of the g-word is a little surprising,

45
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,840
especially because Senator Obama
was pretty comfortable with it.

46
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,000
For those of you who aren't aware,
there was a genocide

47
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,400
that did take place
against the Armenian people.

48
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,760
It is one of the situations
where we have seen a constant denial

49
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,560
on part of the Turkish government
and others that this occurred.

50
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,200
"And apparently, one of those other
deniers is myself from the future.

51
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,000
I know that because
he came back and told me.

52
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,600
I told him what he was saying
made no sense,

53
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,600
he just said 'Benghazi' and left.
I don't know what any of it meant."

54
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,240
The president has tried to come up
with a semantic workaround.

55
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,080
He put out a statement reading,

56
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,960
"I have consistently stated my own
view of what occurred in 1915,

57
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,800
and my view has not changed."

58
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,160
And he's released the same statement,
almost word for word,

59
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,920
on every anniversary
of the Armenian geno-trocity.

60
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,240
Like every year he's playing a game
where the secret word is "genocide."

61
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,400
It's like the most depressing episode
of Pee-Wee's Playhouse ever.

62
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,800
Let's move on to New Zealand.

63
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,960
The country whose major form
of transportation is bungee jumping.

64
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,840
Their Prime Minister, John Key,
has had a spectacular week.

65
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,240
A very unusual story
breaking here.

66
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,440
It involves the prime minister,
a ponytail and some pinot noir.

67
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,800
That is the single greatest news tease
I've ever heard.

68
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,440
Just take a moment right now
at home and imagine a story

69
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,040
in which those three things
come together, and I guarantee you,

70
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,480
what you've just come up is a lot less
weird than what happened.

71
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,800
John Key has apologized
to an Auckland waitress

72
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:47,560
who says he behaved like a bully
by repeatedly pulling her ponytail.

73
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,240
She says "he'd come up behind me
when I was ordering at the terminal,

74
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,880
tug on my hair and then pretend
that his wife Bronagh had done it."

75
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,360
He commented one time,
that's a very tantalizing ponytail."

76
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,880
If you're a full-grown adult male,
there's a very short list of things

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,040
that you can describe as "tantalizing"
without creeping out everyone:

78
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,480
there is steak...

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,400
And that is absolutely it.
That's the only thing.

80
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,760
The crazy thing here is, it turns out
this had been going on for a while.

81
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,880
The woman
says it began in November.

82
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,160
She told him to stop in March
but he continued to do it.

83
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,040
She tried to avoid him,
even telling his security

84
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,200
she "was sick of having
my hair pulled

85
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,720
and one day
I'll punch him in the face."

86
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,080
Why do I get the feeling
his security guards' reaction was,

87
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,000
"Please do. That would be awesome.
We're not allowed to but we want to."

88
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,560
But wait
until you hear his explanation

89
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,440
for a grown man pulling
a waitress's hair.

90
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,000
There's always lots of horsing
around and sort of practical jokes

91
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,560
and look that's
all there really is to it.

92
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,600
I realize she had taken offense,

93
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,960
it was all in the context
of a bit of banter that was going on.

94
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,200
And so I obviously
immediately apologized for that.

95
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,920
I gave her some wine.
She thanked me for that. No drama.

96
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,480
"No drama." You can't just pull
someone's hair for months

97
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,560
then make it all good
with a bottle of wine.

98
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,120
You're the prime minister
of New Zealand,

99
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,200
not a real housewife
of New Jersey.

100
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,520
But amazingly,
this story gets one step weirder.

101
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,000
Because then, people went back
and found other clips of him

102
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,120
randomly touching strangers' hair,

103
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,400
including this one,
of him pulling a child's ponytail.

104
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,600
That's good. That's very sweet.

105
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,720
- Do you know who this man is ?
- Yeah.

106
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,520
- Who is he ?
- The prime minister.

107
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,960
The ponytail pulling
prime minister right there.

108
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,120
What are you doing ?

109
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,680
John Key can't pass any dangling hair
without pawing at it.

110
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,080
He's more cat than prime minister
at this point.

111
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,760
This undermines his authority
during any diplomatic negotiations.

112
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,960
"We'd very much like you
to end the sanctions."

113
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,000
"We're not going to do that:

114
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,040
you're a creepy individual
who pulls women's hair."

115
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,000
"That's a fair point. Make sense.
I'll show myself out. No drama."

116
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,280
And finally,
a quick update on Dr. Oz.

117
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,200
We covered his propensity for
recommending dubious supplements.

118
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,360
Over the past 5 seasons
of his syndicated show,

119
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,320
Dr. Mehmet Oz has touted
a series of exotic diet aids.

120
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,520
I want you to write it down.
Garcinia Cambogia.

121
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,200
Raspberry Ketone.

122
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,320
It's called Yacon Syrup.

123
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,120
Sea Buckthorn.

124
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,920
Blueberry elbows. Acorn semen.
Pricklebush tickletush.

125
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,680
Write all those things down.

126
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,080
Dr. Oz has had a rough year, from
being grilled by a senate committee,

127
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,760
to having a major medical journal
claim that

128
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,960
"evidence supported less than half
of the recommendations on his show,"

129
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,880
to having one of his guests,
celebrity nutritionist Lindsey Duncan,

130
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,600
pay $9 million to settle a lawsuit
with the FTC for misleading claims.

131
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,520
It was hardly surprising because
the only job title more meaningless

132
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,760
than "celebrity nutritionist"
is "sloth wrangler."

133
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,000
They're very slow. You don't need
professional experience to wrangle that.

134
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,080
That's basically an inanimate object.
That's not a job.

135
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,840
You're picking up a stationary thing
and putting it somewhere else.

136
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:40,480
But the point is Dr. Oz
found himself under attack again.

137
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,200
Dr. Oz is being accused of promoting
quack treatments by top physicians

138
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,280
who want to get him fired
from his job at Columbia University.

139
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,040
Yes, 9 out of 10 doctors agree
that that tenth doctor has got to go.

140
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,840
On Thursday, Dr. Oz responded.

141
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,920
You've seen the headlines.
You've heard the controversy.

142
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,440
Now, Dr. Oz fires back.
Coming up next....

143
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,080
Dr. Oz breaks his silence.

144
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,280
Holy shit. They make it sound like
he's about to enter the thunderdome.

145
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,920
"Two doctors enter. One doctor
leaves. Because he was paged."

146
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,200
Dr. Oz spent much of the episode

147
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,600
attacking the doctors
who'd called for his resignation,

148
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,520
arguing that industry ties
were behind their criticism.

149
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,840
But none of that answers
the substance of the accusations

150
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,800
that he's a quack who serves viewers
horseshit dressed up as medicine.

151
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,400
And his response to that
has been pathetic.

152
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,400
It's called the Dr. Oz Show.
We very purposely on the logo

153
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,440
have Oz as the middle and doctor's
up in the little bar for a reason.

154
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,280
I want folks to realize I'm a doctor
and I'm coming into their lives

155
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,200
to be supportive of them,
but it's not a medical show.

156
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,480
It's not a medical show
because the word "doctor" is small ?

157
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,080
If the size of a word in a logo
designated its truth-value,

158
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,440
then this would be
the logo for pizza hut.

159
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,160
Because some bread,
tomatoes and cheese

160
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,320
got blackout drunk and fucked
each other in a dumpster

161
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,880
doesn't mean you get to call
the resulting abomination pizza.

162
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:27,240
Of all of Dr. Oz's flimsy pushbacks,
this was perhaps the weakest.

163
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,360
No matter our disagreements,
freedom of speech

164
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,600
is the most fundamental right
we have as Americans

165
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,000
and these 10 doctors
are trying to silence that right.

166
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,760
No. You are scientifically wrong
about that.

167
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,760
As you are about so many things.

168
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,200
First Amendment protects Americans
from government censorship.

169
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,440
It does not guarantee you
the right to simultaneously

170
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,040
hold a faculty position at a
prestigious, private university

171
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,040
and make misleading claims
on a TV show.

172
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,760
It absolutely protects your right
to say whatever you like on it.

173
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,400
Just as it protects my right to say
what I think about you on mine.

174
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,960
Which is this:
you are the worst person in scrubs

175
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,080
who has ever been on television,
and I'm including Katherine Heigl.

176
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,640
Do have any idea how difficult it is
to be worse than Katherine Heigl ?

177
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,000
You are also the admittedly
handsome ringmaster

178
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,720
of a middling, mid-afternoon
televised snake-oil dispensary,

179
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,720
and it says something that,
even when you do a show

180
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,280
with seven fake models
of human feces,

181
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,320
the biggest piece of shit on the stage
has his name in the title.

182
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,920
Isn't freedom of speech great ?
And now, this !

183
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,440
And now - political figures
interviewing themselves.

184
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,520
Is there money coming in the political
process from wealthy liberals ? Yes.

185
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,640
Is this ideal ? No.

186
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,400
Do I want to support the president ?
Yes I do.

187
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,080
Do I think the climate is changing ?
I think so.

188
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,040
Is there a clear, comprehensive plan ?
Yes.

189
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,640
Do I think it's being thought of ?
I hope so.

190
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,920
Do I think it should've been done ?
Yes.

191
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,360
Could we have done better Friday ?
Yes. And will we ? Yes we will.

192
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,240
I responded appropriately ?

193
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,880
- They're gonna do that ?
- We can do more ?

194
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,000
- Does it make us safer ?
- What would I do ?

195
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,960
- What have I learned ?
- What could I do better ?

196
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,720
What do I think of Congress ?
I don't know.

197
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,040
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns fashion.

198
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,960
Personality you can buy.

199
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,200
It's what makes some people
look fun and fabulous,

200
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,240
and what makes
most men in their 20s

201
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,680
wear variations of a plaid
button-up shirt every single day.

202
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,120
"I've decided
I'm not even gonna try.

203
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,480
I'm gonna wear versions of this
until I'm dead. That's it."

204
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,880
We buy a lot of clothes
in this country.

205
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,120
In 2013, Americans purchased,
on average, 64 items per person.

206
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,680
And we're able to do that
because clothing is incredibly cheap.

207
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,080
As you'd know if you've ever turned
on your TV in the morning.

208
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,600
The price of this dress shocked
a lot of people in our office. $39.99.

209
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,920
Blows me away !

210
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,120
- Kohl's, LC by Lauren Conrad, $35.
- That's amazing !

211
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,640
This is the dress
by Norma Kamali.

212
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,040
- It is $24 at Walmart.
- Get out !

213
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,080
Get out. Seriously, get out.
Security, get her out of here.

214
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:28,000
There is no way that dress is $24.
Go fuck yourself. You lied to me.

215
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,680
And look: for the consumer,
low prices are fantastic.

216
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,440
And nowadays, those clothes
will even look good.

217
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,720
Trendy clothing is cheaper than ever,
cheap clothing is trendier than ever.

218
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,320
This is largely thanks to the rise
of "fast fashion" retailers

219
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:49,000
that produce stylish, low-cost clothing
like H&M, Zara, and Forever 21,

220
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,040
that enables Midwestern tweens
to dress like 40-something alcoholics

221
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,200
attending the funeral
of a Tel Aviv nightclub owner.

222
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,040
It's a powerful look.

223
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,720
A big part of these brands' appeal
is that there's something new to buy.

224
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,080
Just look at H&M's
rate of turnover.

225
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,600
Stores are replenished daily.
From the streets to the runway,

226
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,840
the latest trends are scoured
and can go from a sketch

227
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,000
to the rack in as little as 3 weeks.

228
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,760
We have new garments coming
into the stores almost every day.

229
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,000
So if you go to an H&M store today
and come back 2 days later,

230
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,880
you will find something new.

231
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,400
"Yes, one day maybe you will find
a shirt and it says 'rise and swag.'

232
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,120
Maybe next day you find shirt
with 'pardon my swag.'

233
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,600
And maybe next day after that

234
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,400
you find cocaine-dusted copy
of 'Nylon' magazine in fitting room.

235
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,360
Something new at H&M always.
Always."

236
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,560
H&M's prices are so competitive
that, a few years back,

237
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,280
they put out a dress
that cost just $4.95.

238
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,560
That means you could take a $5 bill,
scotch tape it over your genitals,

239
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,960
and you'd be wearing a more
expensive piece of clothing.

240
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,640
I went online,
and a jar of cricket food costs $5.

241
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,360
A bunch of weird orange cubes
you feed to a bug

242
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,960
are worth five cents more
than this dress.

243
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,160
That dress is 7 cents more than a DVD
of "the Ghosts of Girlfriends Past."

244
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,120
"Inexpensive DVD," raves Variety.

245
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,000
And yet, somehow, fast fashion
companies are massively profitable.

246
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,160
The chairman of H&M is the 28th
richest person in the world

247
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,560
and the co-founder of Zara
is the 4th richest person in the world.

248
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,680
That means people who own
oil fields are worth less

249
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,560
than a guy who makes
distressed jean shorts.

250
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,680
Buying clothes is cheaper
and easier than ever.

251
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,920
And not just
at fast fashion companies

252
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,240
traditional retailers have
lowered their prices as well.

253
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,000
The only way brands make money
is through volume.

254
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,240
And that's why even basics like jeans

255
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,840
now go through fashion cycles
with the lifespan of mayflies.

256
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,840
The big trend is skinny jeans.

257
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,760
Forget about the skinny jean.
Now it's all about the flare jean.

258
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,000
Boyfriend jeans:
big thing for spring.

259
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,080
Jonah is wearing the it jean of the
season and that is the baggy jean.

260
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,440
She's marrying these two trends
that have been so controversial,

261
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,480
the culotte and denim.
We've got a denim culottes.

262
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,080
Denim culottes !
Finally an answer to the question:

263
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,200
what if an 18th century cabin boy
was also Canadian ?

264
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,720
But as great as all these stylish,
cheap clothes are,

265
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,680
it's hard not to look
at those prices and wonder:

266
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,640
how does any clothing company
make money ?

267
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,200
Although, let's be honest:
you know the answer to that.

268
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,360
Half of our clothing used to be made
in the US as recently as 1990.

269
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,320
And today, 2 percent
of the clothes we wear are made here.

270
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,040
We produce clothes
almost entirely overseas,

271
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,560
where it's much cheaper.

272
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,640
And if 98 percent of your products
could be made abroad,

273
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,280
you should really start changing
your name to reflect that fact.

274
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,200
So American Eagle should really
become Bangladeshi Swamp-Hen,

275
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,880
and Banana Republic
should really become...

276
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,240
Actually, that one is fine.

277
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,760
They got ahead of themselves
there for once.

278
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,640
I know you think you've heard
this story before. Because you have.

279
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,240
If you remember, in the 1990s,
sweatshops were a key point of outrage.

280
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,880
Companies like Gap and Nike
were protested,

281
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,200
and then most famously,
there was this.

282
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,920
Kathie Lee Gifford

283
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,640
said she was shocked to learn
that a clothing line bearing her name

284
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,440
was manufactured in sweatshops
and by underage workers.

285
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,560
Yes, Kathie Lee's clothing line
was caught using child labor,

286
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,160
which was surprising, given
how kindly she had always treated

287
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,920
the small, elderly boy
who co-hosted her show.

288
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,080
And the outcry
over sweatshops wasn't just loud:

289
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,000
it got some results. Kathie Lee
even testified in front of Congress.

290
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,280
We are now morally compelled
to ask, each of us,

291
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,120
what can we do to protect labor rights
in factories around the world

292
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,680
and right here in America ?

293
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,800
And given that it was my neglect
that compelled us

294
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,000
to ask
this important moral question.

295
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,280
I say to you: you are welcome.
Let's start day-drinking !

296
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,280
What's wrong with you people ?
It's after 9 a.m. !

297
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,120
Cheers. Good morning.

298
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,840
But amazingly,
and I know this is hard to hear,

299
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,160
Kathie Lee
did not solve everything.

300
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,880
There has been a pattern
of troubling behavior

301
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,520
in the garment industry
for the past 20 years.

302
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,200
Look at Gap,
the nation's number one supplier

303
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,640
of polo shirts
for frat guys to vomit on.

304
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,320
In the '90s, they were
criticized for labor abuses

305
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,040
at a factory making their clothes
in El Salvador.

306
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,160
In response, they agreed to start
"an independent monitoring program."

307
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,200
They had that fun ad where idiots
in ill-fitting khakis swing-danced,

308
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,680
so we kind of forgot all about it.

309
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,840
Until five years later,

310
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,960
when the BBC visited a factory
making Gap clothing in Cambodia.

311
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,280
We'd been told there were children
here making clothes for the Gap.

312
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:20,040
This is Sun Thyda. She's 12 years old.
She told the factory she's 18.

313
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,320
This is Chan Sita. She's 14.
She too lied to get the job.

314
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,440
Monitors never questioned them.

315
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,920
That is no excuse.

316
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,120
If a child gained entry to a bar using
a Pinkberry punch card as a fake ID,

317
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,760
it is the fucking bar's fault.

318
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,600
"It says your middle name
is 'one free topping.'

319
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,720
Cool middle name.
Have fun in there."

320
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,560
In response,
Gap revoked approval of that factory,

321
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,560
and enhanced their age
verification requirements,

322
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,760
which sounded pretty good.
Besides, it was the year 2000,

323
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,360
and they had that ad campaign
where pastel morons did the mambo,

324
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,400
so we kind of forgot
all about it again.

325
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,160
Until seven years after that,

326
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,400
when a British newspaper
visited a workshop in India.

327
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,760
According to a published report,
these children aged 10 to 13

328
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,480
were working as virtual slaves,
stitching shirts for Gap Kids.

329
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,320
Having children make clothes for Gap
is bad enough.

330
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,400
Having them make clothes for Gap Kids
is somehow worse.

331
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,560
"Make a beautiful shirt
that's exactly your size.

332
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,000
It'll be worn once and thrown away.
Now make a thousand more for me."

333
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,800
In response, Gap said it didn't know
its clothes were in that workshop,

334
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,640
and demanded its supplier make

335
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,280
"significant improvements
to its oversight of subcontractors",

336
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,960
and everyone felt better,
especially because it was 2007,

337
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,160
and Gap had just had
that mind- blowingly cool

338
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,920
"holiday in your hood"
campaign with Common.

339
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,480
I know we're talking
about child labor,

340
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,200
but that may be the saddest
that I've felt so far.

341
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,600
Then, in 2010, a fire broke out
at a factory in Bangladesh

342
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,480
that produced Gap clothing,
killing 29 workers.

343
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,080
After that Gap launched
a building and fire safety plan.

344
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,000
Which was great,
because it meant nothing alarming

345
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,360
concerning Gap's presence
in Bangladesh

346
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,240
was ever going to happen again.

347
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,200
Until 2013,
when Al Jazeera found this.

348
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,000
No fire extinguisher. No fire exit.
It's a shack in someone's back yard.

349
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,320
- How old are you ?
- 14.

350
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,800
- How long you've been working here ?
- 2 years.

351
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,520
We attach, all of us together.
Today Sir said, "Finish them today."

352
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,360
It says "Old Navy."

353
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,640
Old Navy is owned by Gap Inc.

354
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,640
I guess at this point,
it seems sweatshops aren't one

355
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,960
of those 90's problems we got rid of,
like Donnie Wahlberg.

356
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,480
They're more
like one of those 90's problems

357
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,760
we're still very much dealing with,
like Mark Wahlberg.

358
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,880
Gap says those Old Navy jeans
were rejected products,

359
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,560
sold without their knowledge,
and never ended up in their stores.

360
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,000
All brands in the industry
have problems.

361
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,360
Gap is by no means the worst.
And if you ask Gap, as we did,

362
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,320
they'll point out they've made
real improvements,

363
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,760
and tried as hard as they can
to fix all this.

364
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,440
But that means a company
trying as hard as it can

365
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,080
has been not infrequently
connected to labor violations

366
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,480
in multiple countries
over two decades.

367
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,000
When you weigh all this up, it seems
the only situation in which Gap

368
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,360
could claim to be
unambiguously helpful to people

369
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,480
is when someone shits their pants
directly outside one of their stores.

370
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,120
"I never thought I'd say this,
but thank god Gap is here to help !

371
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,240
You people are angels."

372
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,880
And one of the biggest problems
with holding many brands accountable

373
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,040
is that deniability seems to have been
stitched into the supply chain.

374
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,520
Look at Walmart.

375
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,240
They insist they hold their suppliers
to high safety standards.

376
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,080
But CBS visited a factory in Bangladesh
making clothes for Walmart

377
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,400
and found otherwise.

378
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,840
The boss at Monde Apparels,
Masudul Haq Chowdhury

379
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,440
showed us an evacuation map marking
the location of 13 fire extinguishers.

380
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,080
But nearly all of them were missing.

381
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,440
If they're not there,
then that's not a map.

382
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,120
It's an aspirational poster
for fire safety.

383
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,520
But if that factory does not conform
to Walmart safety standards,

384
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,520
how were their clothes there ?

385
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,600
The managers told us the factory
hasn't been approved by Walmart

386
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,120
for production but they had an order
for a million Walmart boxer shorts,

387
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,160
subcontracted to them
by another factory.

388
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,560
Walmart sent it to an approved factory,
and that factory

389
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,400
sent it to an unapproved factory
without Walmart's knowledge.

390
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,160
It's a crazy,
one-in-a-million random accident

391
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,600
that's only happened multiple times
over the past few years.

392
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,840
Walmart say their clothing
suppliers in Bangladesh

393
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,800
were doing business with the factory
without their knowledge.

394
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,680
One of its suppliers subcontracted
part of the order to Tazreen

395
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,440
without their permission.

396
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,760
The order was placed with the troubled
factory without its knowledge.

397
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,360
It had no idea production
ever happened there

398
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,800
and this is not the first time Walmart
has been caught unaware.

399
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,920
No, it's not. And they are losing
the right to act surprised.

400
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,080
They're like the characters
in the "Hangover" movies.

401
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,600
It's not an accident
the third time, boys.

402
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,080
It's a pattern of reckless behavior
which has to be addressed.

403
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,320
One of you is going to wind up dead,
the one who's never on the poster.

404
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,840
Since the '90s, we've sporadically
cared about this.

405
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,080
Including two years ago this week,
after the Rana Plaza building collapse.

406
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,360
5 days after that deadly building
collapse in Bangladesh,

407
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,360
rescuers continue to pull survivors
from the rubble.

408
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,040
New pictures overnight
show dramatic rescues,

409
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,600
some using their bare hands
to free those who are still trapped.

410
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,280
At least 360 people have been killed,
hundreds more still missing.

411
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,600
That building collapse ended up
killing more than 1,100 people.

412
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,760
Everyone was justifiably horrified.
That report aired on the Today Show,

413
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,040
so you know
that everyone there heard it.

414
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,720
We then found that brands like
Joe Fresh and the Children's Place

415
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,920
had been made in Rana Plaza,
and we were horrified again.

416
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,720
We get so blinded by low prices
that just a few months later,

417
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,520
the Today Show was doing this.

418
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,960
This adorable sequined bag
is from the Children's Place.

419
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,520
I found it for under $10.

420
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,200
You don't want to spend a ton of money,
you're gonna spill something on it.

421
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,640
I found this one which is a silk-poly
blend from Joe Fresh.

422
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,400
Still feels really soft. 19 bucks.

423
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,960
19 bucks ! Get out !
Get the fuck out of the studio !

424
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,080
Think about what you're doing.

425
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,880
Because one of the ladies cooing
over that $19 Joe Fresh blouse

426
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,560
is Kathie Lee Gifford.

427
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,360
And if she can forget the human
cost of shockingly cheap clothing,

428
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,640
then that is - not in that case
actually that surprising.

429
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,040
Her brain is basically pickled
in Chardonnay at this point.

430
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,080
But it doesn't give you much
hope for everyone else.

431
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,240
This is going to keep happening
as long as we let it.

432
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,600
So we need to show clothing
brands not just that we care,

433
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,160
but why they should.

434
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,360
We have a little surprise for the
leaders of some of these companies.

435
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,920
I'm talking
about the heads of H&M,

436
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,080
of Walmart, of Gap, of Joe Fresh,
and of the Children's Place.

437
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,600
I have bought you all of you lunch.

438
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,640
Which will be turning up
to your office tomorrow.

439
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,720
I do not know exactly
how this food was made.

440
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,800
I told someone,
who may have told someone else

441
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,160
to get the most food they could,
for the cheapest price.

442
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,240
And they did that.
I do have strict policies in place.

443
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,200
I told them not to spit on that food,
or to rub their balls on that food.

444
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,600
I've trusted them to abide by that.

445
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,400
I want you to look
at the suspiciously cheap food

446
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,040
that lands on your desk tomorrow,
and I want you to fucking eat it.

447
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,880
If you're thinking, "I can't do that,
I don't know where it came from,

448
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,280
what if someone
rubbed their balls on it ?"

449
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,920
Then I don't know
what to tell you, other than,

450
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,600
"Do you understand the importance
of supply chain management ?"

451
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,880
But why am I telling you about
your lunch when I can show you ?

452
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,600
Introducing the spring collection
of your lunch tomorrow.

453
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,000
First, please welcome Dave.

454
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,360
Dave is wearing an Old Navy
shirt and shorts.

455
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,200
His total outfit costs just $23.78.

456
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,400
He's carrying the frighteningly
cheap sushi platter

457
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,120
that will be arriving
at your office tomorrow.

458
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,560
Thank you Dave.
Let's move on: to Walmart !

459
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,200
Christian is modeling both a summer
maxi dress, available for under $15,

460
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,640
and a tray of flautas
that we got for just $1.75 each !

461
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,680
Which is so close to being free,
it's literally nauseating !

462
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,840
Moving on to Joe Fresh !

463
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,520
And Austin is pairing
a sweatshirt and casual pant

464
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,440
that cost under $40.

465
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,840
How is it so cheap ? It's a mystery !

466
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,760
Much like the contents
of that gigantic pile

467
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,840
of cheap dumplings
that you will be eating tomorrow.

468
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,200
Thank you Austin.

469
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,520
Let's move
on to our H&M collection.

470
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,920
We've paired Haley's
sub-20-dollar jeans and blouse

471
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,160
with shrimp
and salmon pastry for five,

472
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,240
which will genuinely be arriving
at your Stockholm offices tomorrow.

473
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,400
I'm guessing that you will smell it
before it gets into the room.

474
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,080
And finally, thank you,
please welcome:

475
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,720
the Children's Place !

476
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,680
And say hello to Elliot.

477
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,040
She's wearing
an adorable white summer dress,

478
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,760
which costs less than $15 !

479
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,400
And what's that she's pulling ?
That would be your lunch !

480
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,240
A selection of dirt-cheap
rotisserie chickens !

481
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,880
I have no idea where they came from,
or what might've happened to them.

482
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,800
But Elliot sure wants you to eat them,
isn't that right, Elliot ?

483
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:22,800
Exactly. So eat them ! Eat them.
Eat this wagon of mystery chickens !

484
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,160
That's our show !
Thank you to all our models.

485
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,080
We'll see you next week !
