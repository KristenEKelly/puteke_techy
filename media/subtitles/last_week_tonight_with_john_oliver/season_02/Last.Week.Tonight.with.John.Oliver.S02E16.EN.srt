00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,360
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,040
Season 2
Episode 16

3
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,400
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,840
I'm John Oliver,
thank you so much

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,800
for being with us
this evening.

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,960
Just time for a quick recap
of the week,

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,320
and obviously we begin
with FIFA,

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,080
the sports organization
that is much easier to pronounce

9
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,360
than "Niffle", "Mulb",

10
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,160
or "Unba".

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,880
Last week, we covered
FIFA's recent scandals,

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,080
and how shocking it was that their
Swiss lizard of a president,

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,720
Sepp Blatter,
was still in office.

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,840
Well, on Tuesday there
was some amazing news.

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,920
Top of the hour as Sepp Blatter
shocks the globe.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,880
You don't often say that with accuracy,
but that happened today,

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,960
resigning as the president
of FIFA.

18
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,840
Oh, my God !

19
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,920
He's leaving !
He's actually leaving !

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,200
I feel like a
Greenpeace volunteer

21
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,760
who successfully got
someone's attention.

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,840
I didn't think
this would happen,

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,120
and now I don't know
what to do.

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,720
Now, if you watched us
last week, you'll know

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,320
that I may have some personal Bud Light
Lime related consequences due to this.

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,680
We will deal with that
later in the show.

27
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,200
But for now,
let's just focus on the story,

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,520
because the timing of
Blatter's announcement

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,920
was notable for two reasons.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,120
First, it was only four days
after being reelected president.

31
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,200
That's like being elected pope
and immediately announcing,

32
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,880
"Judaism makes some
good points.

33
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,160
I think I may have
got this wrong."

34
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,760
And secondly, Blatter stepped down
just days before the U.S. release

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,120
of United Passions, a suspiciously
glowing movie history of FIFA.

36
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,600
This is the movie version
of Sepp Blatter,

37
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,360
played by Tim Roth
and largely bankrolled

38
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,640
by the football
organization itself.

39
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,560
This movie theater is the only one
in New York showing United Passions.

40
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,760
We're just a few minutes
from the very first showing,

41
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,600
and, well, they're not exactly
fighting off the crowds.

42
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,880
Am I the only person
going to see this film ?

43
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
So far.

44
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,560
Okay.

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,680
So I say this.

46
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,920
To the one person
in New York who has been looking

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,520
for a large private room in which
to masturbate to images of Tim Roth,

48
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,080
it would appear you
are finally in luck.

49
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,920
Thank you for your patience.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,240
The reviews so far
have been phenomenal.

51
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,080
The Guardian said that
"as cinema, it is excrement."

52
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,320
And The New York Times called it
"one of the most unwatchable films

53
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,640
in recent memory."
And remember,

54
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,760
this is the same week
the Entourage movie came out.

55
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,640
Hashtag, the boys are back.

56
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,520
But perhaps most worrying
of all for FIFA

57
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,920
was that their former
vice president Jack Warner,

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,760
who stands accused of facilitating
at least $10 million in bribes,

59
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,200
has indicated he might
take everyone else down with him.

60
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,920
In a rambling seven-minute
video he released Wednesday

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,520
entitled "Jack Warner:
The Gloves Are Off,"

62
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,240
he vowed to reveal
rampant wrongdoing

63
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,200
at the highest levels
of world soccer.

64
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,920
I have, as promised, comparative,
comprehensive series of documents

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,240
including checks and statements

66
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,760
and I placed them
in different and respected hands.

67
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,920
I don't know what
I love more about that,

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,960
that he released a video
that was basically a veiled threat,

69
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,200
or that it played
on Trinidadian television.

70
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,120
Because apparently,
you can just buy time on TV there

71
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,960
to say whatever you like.

72
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,960
So here's the thing,
that's what we've done.

73
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,920
We have...

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We have more to say to Jack Warner
than we have room for here.

75
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,120
So we bought five minutes of airtime
on Trinidad's TV 6

76
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,720
at 9:01 p.m. on Tuesday.

77
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,280
We will be preempting the first
five minutes of, and this is true,

78
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,880
Mike & Molly,

79
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,880
and we'll be doing it
with "John Oliver:

80
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,880
The Mittens
Of Disapproval Are On."

81
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,920
So fly to Trinidad on Tuesday
if you want to see that.

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,920
But for now, the rest of us,

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,240
let's move on
to cyber security,

84
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,880
the only reason most of us
know our mother's maiden name.

85
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,240
It's an increasingly
important part of America's defense,

86
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,800
and on Thursday
we saw why.

87
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,240
This morning the U.S.
government is struggling

88
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,880
to assess the damage,

89
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,760
officials revealing possibly
the biggest cyber attack

90
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,800
on the U.S. government ever breached
their critical computer networks.

91
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,120
Okay, CNN, a hack into government
computers is perfectly scary enough

92
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,720
without adding leftover
graphics from The Matrix.

93
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,680
The problem is already huge
without the specter

94
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,880
of a merciless kung fu quasi-Jesus
in a duster jacket.

95
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,120
The hackers broke into systems
containing information

96
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,320
for more than four million
current and former federal employees,

97
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,480
potentially hitting
every federal agency

98
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,200
from the Department
of Justice all the way

99
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,960
to even the National
Marine Fisheries Service.

100
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,080
Which means there could be an
undercover Fisheries officer right now

101
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,840
whose information
is in the hands of hackers.

102
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,560
Sergeant Gillis,
swim away !

103
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,800
Your cover's blown !
Get out of there !

104
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,720
So I have to know,
who is responsible for this ?

105
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,440
According to officials,
evidence points to hackers

106
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,160
working for
the Chinese military.

107
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,040
The motive here may be
to obtain personal information

108
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,480
that can be used
for blackmail purposes

109
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,920
to turn some of those
U.S. employees

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,440
into spies, perhaps even,
for the Chinese, at least informants.

111
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,560
That's crazy.
Listen, China.

112
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,120
If you want to blackmail Americans,
you're going about this wrong.

113
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,160
Don't bother hacking into government
computers to grab our personnel files.

114
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,880
Just get our browser histories
and we'll turn traitor instantly.

115
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,920
Because you can have
our Social Security numbers,

116
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,400
but there is no one on Earth
who would not betray their country

117
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,000
to keep people from finding out that
their last five Google searches were

118
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,160
"What country are dragons in ?",

119
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,320
"Ray Romano nip slip,"

120
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,240
"Sexiest cats,"

121
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,720
"Tinder one year
no matches troubleshoot,"

122
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,240
and "Uncontrollable
farting cancer ?"

123
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,320
You want leverage, China,
that's where you'll find it.

124
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,560
And finally,
finally this week, Turkey.

125
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,920
Turkey, the country that's always
much bigger than you think it is.

126
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,360
Much like Tim Robbins. Did you know
he's six-five ? He's very big.

127
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,360
Turkey's election was today,

128
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,000
and the ruling party
lost their majority.

129
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,920
The election turned on too many issues
to get into now,

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
but there was one
which I have to mention,

131
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,640
because last week
opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu

132
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,280
accused Turkey's president
Recep Erdogan

133
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,840
of wasting taxpayer money
on something truly ridiculous.

134
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,440
Opposition leader
Kemal Kilicdaroglu

135
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,160
accused the president
of using taxpayers' money

136
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,600
to decorate his bathroom,

137
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,200
most notably
with a golden lavatory.

138
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,160
Yes. He claimed Erdogan
has a golden toilet.

139
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,400
And that hurts, 'cause on the list of
offensive symbols of wealth,

140
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,880
that is somewhere between

141
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,920
having a servant carry you
everywhere piggyback style

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,800
and owning poor people
touching gloves.

143
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,280
It's a heavy accusation,

144
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,440
which is why Erdogan
hit back hard.

145
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,320
The president issued a challenge
to the opposition leader.

146
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,120
I invite him

147
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,280
to please come
and take a tour.

148
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,200
I wonder if he'll be able to find

149
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,000
such a golden toilet seat
in any of these washrooms.

150
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,800
If he finds it,
I will resign from the presidency.

151
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,960
If he can't find them,
he will resign from his party.

152
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,480
Yes, you heard that right.

153
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,280
He was offering a good,
old-fashioned,

154
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,160
loser leaves town
Turkish toilet hunt.

155
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,400
And those
are some high stakes.

156
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,280
Because normally, the worst thing that
happens when you can't find a toilet

157
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,800
is you tie a sweatshirt
around your waist

158
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,200
and you quietly leave
the house party.

159
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,640
Now, sadly, the challenge was refused,
which is a tragedy.

160
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,280
Because what Erdogan was proposing
was a literal game of thrones.

161
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,480
"All this power will be yours, if you
can find the fabled golden toilet.

162
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,280
However, if you cannot, you shall
be banished from the kingdom.

163
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,280
For in the game of thrones,
you poop or you die."

164
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,760
And now, this.

165
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,840
And now,

166
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,480
Last Week Tonight salutes
all the horses

167
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,320
who didn't win the triple crown
this week !

168
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,840
Here's to you...
Wickets and Biscuits

169
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,080
Nimble Tim,

170
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,960
Bumblebee's Climax,

171
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,280
Oedipal Steve,

172
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,560
White Guilt,

173
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,160
Why Did Daddy Leave ?,

174
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,760
Tomorrow's Glue,

175
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,120
Recliners ! Recliners ! Recliners !,

176
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,720
DR. JUDDY LEVINSON, D.D.S.

177
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,400
Shakira's Tapeworm,

178
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,720
and Hank Bonesack,
Private Investigator.

179
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,280
Congratulations on being horses !
To us, you're all winners !

180
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,760
AND
NOW

181
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,520
Our main story tonight
is bail.

182
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,520
We're so used to it, it has become
a fixture of American life.

183
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Down here at the shore,
one minute you got three girls

184
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,200
in a Jacuzzi, next minute
somebody's in jail

185
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,560
and you have to
bail them out.

186
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,320
That's what happens
down at the shore.

187
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,920
The other thing that happens
down at the shore ? Chlamydia.

188
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,320
Just a medically astounding
rate of chlamydia.

189
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,720
At its heart, America's bail system
sounds pretty simple.

190
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,520
If you're charged with a crime,
the court might ask for an amount

191
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,360
of money as bond and then return it
to you once you show up for trial.

192
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,320
And if you have that money,
it's no big deal.

193
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,960
But if you don't,
you can be in big trouble.

194
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,560
Just look at one example,
a man called Miguel.

195
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,320
He was arrested for driving
with a suspended license,

196
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,280
the court set bail at a thousand
dollars, and he had a choice,

197
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,280
pay it or await a trial
in Rikers Island.

198
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,320
And I'll let Miguel and his wife take
the story from there.

199
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,560
I wouldn't wish Rikers
on my worst enemy, 'cause it's rough.

200
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,240
It was hard because I had to borrow,
I had to try to borrow money

201
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,200
from this person,
and this person,

202
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,920
and this person
to try to get him out.

203
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,680
He told the judge, "I can't afford
a thousand dollar bail."

204
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,880
So he really didn't
have a choice but to plead guilty.

205
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,320
Now whether he was guilty or not,
the fact is a nonviolent offender

206
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,000
spent time in Rikers because
he didn't have a thousand dollars.

207
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,200
And this is
a systemic problem.

208
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,840
Increasingly,
bail has become a way

209
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,280
to lock up the poor
regardless of guilt.

210
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,120
Because Miguel
was a family man

211
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,760
who posed no danger to society
whatsoever and he was stuck in Rikers,

212
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,160
whereas millionaire
Robert Durst,

213
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,440
who'd been accused
of murder in Texas,

214
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,840
had a completely different
experience of the bail system.

215
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,560
I'd been told
by the detective that,

216
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,840
"You've been charged with murder,
bail has been set at $250,000."

217
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,840
But was your intention when you put up
the $250,000 to run away ?

218
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,000
Oh, good-bye $250,000.
Good-bye jail. I'm out !

219
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,400
"I'm out !"

220
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,720
That, of course, is an excerpt from
Robert Durst's children's book

221
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,040
"Goodbye Jail."

222
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,280
"Good-bye, money.
Good-bye, bail.

223
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,240
I killed them all,
but good-bye jail.

224
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,680
Of course. Of course."

225
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,520
The problem is the frequency and cost
of bail have risen dramatically,

226
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,640
and it is disproportionately
hurting the poor.

227
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,520
In fact, in 2013, an analysis
of New Jersey's jail population

228
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,320
found that nearly 40 percent
were being held solely because

229
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,320
they couldn't meet the terms
of their bail, which is crazy.

230
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,680
Jail is supposed to be
for dangerous criminals.

231
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,000
If 40 percent of a group don't meet
the basic criteria to be there,

232
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,360
that should change your perception
of what that group is.

233
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,520
If 40 percent of the Girl Scouts
were grown men,

234
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,640
you'd feel weird about
buying cookies from them.

235
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,680
So what happens
if you can't make bail ?

236
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,920
Much like a game of "Fuck, Marry, Kill"
with Crosby, Stills, and Nash,

237
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,480
there are a few
terrible scenarios.

238
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,280
Option one,
you sit in jail.

239
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,280
And again, if you're poor,
as this defense attorney explains,

240
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,480
that has immediate
consequences.

241
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,360
Our clients work at jobs where if
you're absent, you're fired.

242
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,320
Our clients live in shelters
or in transitional housing,

243
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,320
places where if you're not there
for the night, your place is gone.

244
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,320
So there are a lot of different ways
in which incarceration,

245
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,280
even for a short period of time,
can really destroy someone's life.

246
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,080
Exactly. Jail can do
for your actual life

247
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,320
what being in a marching band
can do for your social life.

248
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:46,280
Even if you're just in
for a little while, it can destroy you.

249
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,240
Destroy you.

250
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,440
But that means,
it's no wonder

251
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,280
that many defendants who can't afford
bail favor option number two,

252
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,120
simply pleading guilty
even if you're not,

253
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,280
as a former public defender
explains.

254
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,720
You sit in jail because
you can't afford

255
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,520
to pay your way to freedom.

256
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,280
And you're often confronted with a deal
that goes like this,

257
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,960
plead guilty, get out,

258
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,320
maintain your innocence
and go to trial, stay in.

259
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,800
And poor people are regularly choosing
to admit guilt

260
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,360
just to get out of there,
which isn't good.

261
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,360
The only time that's appropriate is in
a Catholic confessional.

262
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,720
"What do you mean
is there anything else ?

263
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,320
I don't know, I masturbated
into a kiwi fruit.

264
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,080
Is that what you want to hear ?
Just let me leave !

265
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,840
I have stuff to do."

266
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,280
And the problem is, if you do plead
guilty to a crime you didn't commit,

267
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,920
that has its own downsides,
because, unfortunately,

268
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,320
on a job application
next to the question

269
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,480
"Have you ever been convicted
of a crime ? Check yes or no..."

270
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,600
most don't then leave
four pages of blank space to explain

271
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,680
the social and economic inequalities
inherent in the legal system.

272
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,000
That brings us to your final option,
commercial bail bondsmen.

273
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,640
You know, the people who make
amazing ads like these.

274
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,440
Grumpy's Bail Bonds
has busted out

275
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,160
all over middle Tennessee.

276
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,080
I ain't going out like that

277
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,440
I'm a call for bail bonds
'cause they got my back

278
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,680
They got me out in no time,
now I'm back on track

279
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,120
Jesus Christ Bail Bonds !

280
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,360
May God release you on
a payment plan by calling me.

281
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,240
I'm Bishop Barry
of Jesus Christ Bail Bonds.

282
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,520
410-292-3029.

283
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,000
- If you're locked up and afraid...
- Bail out !

284
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,280
- Bail out !
- Bail out !

285
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
- Bail out !
- Bail out !

286
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,400
Bail out !
Jesus Christ Bail Bonds !

287
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,280
Yes. Jesus Christ
Bail Bonds !

288
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,880
Amazing.
But I will say,

289
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,920
it is a little weird
given that Jesus,

290
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
pretty memorably, I think,
was not bailed out.

291
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,000
I mean,
he did eventually escape custody,

292
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,000
but it was a real
workaround of the system.

293
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,440
Now here is how
that system works, though.

294
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,880
Bail bondsmen promise
the court to pay your bail

295
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,240
if you fail to show up
for a trial.

296
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,320
In exchange, you pay them
10 to 15 percent of the bail amount,

297
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,920
which they then keep
regardless of how your trial goes.

298
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,880
So if your bail
is $5,000 and you're found innocent,

299
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,600
then you've basically
just paid a $750 fee to a bondsman

300
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,480
for doing absolutely
nothing wrong.

301
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,240
And paying $750
for absolutely nothing

302
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,480
should be reserved
for one thing and one thing only

303
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,560
six-month gym memberships.
That's it.

304
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,360
You're not gonna use it, Gerald.

305
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,200
You're gonna use the treadmill twice,
and that's it.

306
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,440
This is learning to speak Korean
all over again, Gerald.

307
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,840
And if you don't show up
for your trial,

308
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,280
bail bondsmen routinely
hire bounty hunters to track you down,

309
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,960
and they have a frightening
amount of power.

310
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,320
In all but four states,
the companies are legally

311
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,120
allowed to take almost any measure
necessary to capture a client,

312
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,360
including crossing state lines
and breaking into homes.

313
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,280
It's a dangerous business
for everyone involved,

314
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,800
with few rules
and little oversight.

315
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,560
Oh, they're not kidding.
In 18 states,

316
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,280
anyone can become
a bounty hunter

317
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,440
regardless of education,
training,

318
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,360
or prior criminal history.

319
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,280
Becoming a bounty hunter
is basically a lot

320
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,680
like becoming
a social media expert.

321
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,120
All it takes is
wanting it bad enough

322
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,320
and not caring about whether strangers
hate you or not.

323
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,160
But then the news
that any idiot can be a bounty hunter

324
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,360
shouldn't really be
that surprising to you

325
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,760
if you've ever turned on A&E
and stumbled across this.

326
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,280
I am a lawman
on a mission from God.

327
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,200
When I say "freeze !",

328
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,360
they know what I'm saying.

329
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,320
- How's it going, man ?
- Freeze !

330
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,320
Get down !

331
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,840
The only way this guy
will get away from us

332
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,080
is if he kills himself
right now

333
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,720
and jumps into
a pool of sharks.

334
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,280
Okay. Okay.

335
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,040
I have to be a stickler
over chronology, Dog,

336
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,720
but how do you kill yourself and then
jump into a pool of sharks ?

337
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,680
That's the kind
of attention to detail, Dog,

338
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,040
that makes me worry about you
operating as an unregulated vigilante.

339
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,680
Now that show
was so popular,

340
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,080
it inspired pretty much
every other bail business

341
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,280
to pitch themselves
as a reality show.

342
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,320
Just click around online
and you will find sizzle reels

343
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,440
for a veritable
smorgasbord of similar shows.

344
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,240
Walk and you talk
and you're acting like a criminal

345
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,640
Running through the woods
like a four-legged animal

346
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,640
The bottom line is, while
you're on bond, we're on your ass.

347
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,280
Dear idiot,
we're coming to get you.

348
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,280
Bounty hunting
is a natural high.

349
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,280
You gotta think like them,
be like them,

350
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,280
and react quicker than them.

351
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,600
Put your hands up !

352
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,720
You want tough ?

353
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,280
You want action ?

354
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,880
Meet Big Benny.

355
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,560
They call him Teddy Bear.

356
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,600
Denise

357
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,000
The Huntress

358
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,280
It doesn't stop there.

359
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,880
There's also Richard,
the Screwdriver.

360
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,600
Richard L.,
the Other Richard.

361
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,080
Allison,
the Greco Roman Wrestler.

362
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,320
Caroline, the one who took up archery
after watching The Hunger Games.

363
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,360
And don't forget Jennifer,
the arthritic alpaca in a bowler hat.

364
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,280
Actually, you know what ?

365
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,320
I now regret
making fun of that.

366
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,480
Now that
I'm seeing the cast, I get the appeal.

367
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,440
I want to see
those characters grow.

368
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Clearly, these shows
are in a competitive marketplace.

369
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,240
And the problem is,
when people try to stick out,

370
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,280
ideas like this happen.

371
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,280
So what do we
do differently ?

372
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,840
We don't just bounty hunt,
we bounty race.

373
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,920
Each week,

374
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,040
two new teams
of bounty hunters...

375
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,760
go head to head.

376
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,320
Welcome to the most dangerous
competition on television.

377
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,600
Bail Chasers.

378
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,880
Okay. First of all,

379
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,880
first of all, the most dangerous
competition on television

380
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,680
is The Bachelorette.

381
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,000
Those women have loved
and they've lost.

382
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,200
Love is a reward, but it's also a risk,
goddamn it ! It's a risk !

383
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,120
She's putting herself
on the line !

384
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,640
She's there
for the right reasons !

385
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,800
She sees her husband
in that room !

386
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,840
And second, it says something
about how comfortable we all are

387
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,960
with how our bail system
works that a TV show

388
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,960
where people with guns
hunt humans for sport

389
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,280
seems legitimate
because we just think,

390
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,720
"Well, they're just
doing their actual job."

391
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,520
And when you give
bounty hunters this kind of power,

392
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,360
bad things happen.

393
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,200
Veteran Gene Travis says
he was sitting with his wife

394
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,360
on his Bethpage front porch.
Next thing he knows,

395
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,840
his barn is being searched, and Travis
has a stun gun pointed at his back.

396
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,080
The intruders, Mark Brummett
and his wife Angela,

397
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,160
bounty hunters who police
say had the wrong home.

398
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,200
Clay was shot
by one of the bondsman.

399
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,280
He was then transported
to EIRMC, where he died.

400
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,560
Was a bounty hunter
justified in tasing

401
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,800
a Midwest City homeowner
last Saturday ?

402
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,160
Was another justified
in shooting his dog ?

403
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,240
Police say the video tape
they took says no.

404
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,400
Yeah, the video says no,

405
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,560
basic human decency says no,

406
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,000
even a Magic 8 Ball
having seen that would say,

407
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,440
"Holy shit ! I can't believe
you're even asking me. No !"

408
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,280
Look, our current
bail system makes no sense

409
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,400
and it does a lot of harm.

410
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,080
And the frustrating thing
is we've known this for a long time.

411
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,920
Just watch this TV
news special from 1964.

412
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,280
Yes, the jails
are bursting at the seams,

413
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,000
a problem of great concern

414
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,440
to New York City Commissioner
of Correction Anna Cross.

415
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,320
Remaining in jail
because you can't get bail

416
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,280
is really being punished
before you're even found guilty.

417
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,000
As far as I was concerned,
that was not just.

418
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,480
That was destroying
our concept of justice.

419
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,200
That's right.
This problem has been obvious

420
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,800
since it was considered okay
to wear a wastebasket on your head.

421
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,400
But look,
here's the good news.

422
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,720
There is a better way,
and it's already in use

423
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,120
in our federal courts
and in Washington, D.C.

424
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,400
Judges in Washington
are allowed to set money bail

425
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,600
only if the defendant
can afford it.

426
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,440
The results have been far fewer people
spending time behind bars.

427
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,720
We are the only city
in America

428
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,720
where tonight
at our jail

429
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,920
there is not a single man
or woman

430
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,200
who is sitting
because they don't have the money

431
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,440
to meet their money bond.

432
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,200
And it's a testament

433
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,000
to the state
of our justice system

434
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,440
that that qualifies
as bragging,

435
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,680
because that should
be the norm.

436
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,920
He's like a bus driver
showing up at school saying,

437
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,840
"23 kids picked up,
23 kids dropped off.

438
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,760
I pitched a perfect game."

439
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,200
Pretrial services
works like this.

440
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,280
After you're arrested,
specialists assess

441
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,720
if you're dangerous
or a flight risk.

442
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,440
If a judge decides that you're not,
you can go home,

443
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,320
and they may monitor you with things
like drug tests or ankle monitors.

444
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,960
They even call you
to remind you of your court date.

445
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,280
It's a system built
on interviews,

446
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,440
pre-arranged appearances,
and trust.

447
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,600
Much like Scientology
marriages, only in this case,

448
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,120
much more effective.

449
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,920
And pretrial service programs
have succeeded around the country

450
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,760
in places ranging
from Oregon to Florida.

451
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,280
And it is a truly
frightening state of affairs

452
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,200
when Florida is a model
for progressive change.

453
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,600
It shouldn't be a judicial example
for anything.

454
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,960
Did you know,
by the way, that under Florida law

455
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,720
if you possess over five grams of meth,
you can marry it.

456
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,520
That's a fact.
That's a legal fact.

457
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,760
That's an actual photo

458
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,600
that ran in a newspaper's
wedding section in Florida.

459
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,680
And yet,

460
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,320
even counties in Florida recognize
our money bail system is broken.

461
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,320
And not only is pretrial services
better, it's cheaper.

462
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,280
A recent assessment of one system
showed it costing only a tenth

463
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,600
as much as keeping
someone locked up.

464
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,320
Which makes sense, because
calling someone to check in

465
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,280
costs virtually nothing.

466
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,320
This message brought
to you by your mother.

467
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,320
Your mother, she brought you
into this world,

468
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,720
and would like to hear
your fucking voice once in a while !

469
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,240
So...

470
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,480
So if pretrial services
are fairer, better, and cheaper,

471
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,920
why aren't we all
using it ?

472
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,280
Well, maybe because
thanks to reality shows,

473
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,040
we think that this
is what justice looks like.

474
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,560
We're gonna hunt
this scum down.

475
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,240
Down ! Now !

476
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,760
Bad dog.

477
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,040
So maybe we just need
a new kind of reality show

478
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,400
to get us used
to the alternative.

479
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,840
You want tough ?

480
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,080
You want action ?

481
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,560
Move !

482
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,400
Meet Steve Carp.

483
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,280
He's one of the most respected pretrial
services caseworkers

484
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,000
in the United States.

485
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,480
So let's see. Okay, looks like
you were ticketed

486
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,200
with public urination.
No priors.

487
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,760
Seems like
a one-off sort of thing.

488
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,240
Can we count on you to be back here
in six weeks for your trial ?

489
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,280
Of course.

490
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,520
Great.
We're done here.

491
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,680
Nothing else to talk about ?

492
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,280
No.

493
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,880
This is a routine thing.

494
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,080
Statistically,
he's virtually guaranteed to turn up.

495
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,560
We're done here.

496
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
We're done here.

497
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,160
They call him, Steve
"The Hand Grenade,"

498
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,080
and he works with a crack team
of legal enforcers.

499
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,360
Meet Deborah.

500
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,480
PRETRIAL SERVICES - "THE PIT"

501
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,840
Hello. This is Deborah
from Pretrial Services.

502
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,440
I'm just calling
to remind you about

503
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,920
your upcoming court date
this Thursday.

504
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,720
Well, you're welcome.

505
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,320
They call her "The Viper."

506
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,480
I feel like a cat.
You know...

507
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,840
All right, back to work.

508
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,680
PRETRIAL SERVICES - "THE VAULT"

509
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,800
And then there's Brett.

510
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,480
So all these
are risk assessments.

511
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,800
This is all computerized,
but, you know,

512
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,840
I keep a hard copy
just in case.

513
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,160
That's why they call him
"The Annihilator."

514
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,480
And finally, Gerald,

515
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,280
the guy in charge
of urine tests.

516
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,200
Clear. If there's something
in there that's illegal,

517
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,880
I'm gonna sniff it out.
'Cause that's what I do.

518
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,360
I'm a piss sniffer.

519
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,760
We got one.

520
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,480
They call him "The Nose."

521
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,200
You really gonna make
a TV show out of this ?

522
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,400
Who's gonna watch it ?

523
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,680
You will, because this fall,

524
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,320
we'll be bringing you
all the thrills and excitement

525
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,520
of pretrial supervision as this
elite team brings people to justice.

526
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,680
Well, we don't bring them to justice.
It's more like we make arrangements

527
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,520
for them to bring
themselves to justice.

528
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,320
Ignore that. This show is full
of high-stakes drama...

529
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,720
You better pray I don't get you
for secret Santa this year !

530
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,520
You don't wanna
fuck with Deborah.

531
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,880
And inter-office romance.

532
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,280
Gerald is a bloodhound.

533
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,960
Oh, yeah ! She wants me.

534
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,280
And if wasn't for all them
cats, I would hit that.

535
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,880
I would knock the bottom
out of her.

536
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,480
But most importantly...

537
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:14,160
We take you
closer to the action !

538
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,400
Filling out forms
and filing them in triplicate

539
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,160
We won't lock you up
if your crime's not significant

540
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,560
If you get a ticket
for public urination

541
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,840
We won't lock you up
so you lose your occupation

542
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,320
We kick it indoors,
screaming dead or alive

543
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,120
This is an office job,
we all go home at five

544
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,040
The system works well,
so there's no need for nervousness

545
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,240
It's all in the game
at Pretrial Services

546
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,160
Pretrial Services.

547
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,200
Coming this fall to A&E.

548
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,960
It's cost-effective,
motherfucker.

549
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,640
And finally tonight,
FIFA again.

550
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,560
Listen, I cannot
avoid this any longer.

551
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,800
We have some
unfinished business.

552
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,040
On Sunday night,

553
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,920
while reporting on
the FIFA scandal,

554
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,400
John Oliver
made this promise.

555
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,800
Budweiser,
if you pull your support,

556
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,320
and help get rid of Blatter,

557
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,840
I will put my mouth
where my mouth is

558
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,520
and I will personally
drink one of your disgusting items.

559
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,200
I'm serious.
It can be a Bud Light.

560
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,280
I will even drink
a Bud Light Lime.

561
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,160
I did promise that.

562
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,680
And, you know what ?
It didn't end there.

563
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,360
I also promised to wear
these ridiculous Adidas shoes

564
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,760
and take a bite from everything
on the McDonald's Dollar Menu.

565
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,120
I didn't think
this would happen.

566
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,520
Now, to be fair,
to be fair,

567
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,640
it is not clear that the sponsors had
anything to do with Blatter leaving,

568
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,160
and Blatter's departure
still leaves FIFA with a huge amount

569
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,800
of restructuring to do.
But, that said,

570
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,320
a promise is a promise,
and I'm a man of my word.

571
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,840
So first,
check these puppies out.

572
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,280
Who needs arch support
when you look

573
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,800
like Louis XIV
going to a rap battle ?

574
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,320
And as for McDonald's,
well... I'm doin' it.

575
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,400
So let's see.
A bite of all of this disgusting mess.

576
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,320
It's like there's
a party in my mouth,

577
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,600
and my stomach
has called the cops to shut it down.

578
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,720
Look, I can't
delay it any longer.

579
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,920
We all know
what the main event is.

580
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,320
I promised I'd drink a Bud Light Lime
and say it was delicious.

581
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,360
However, for the record,
I didn't promise anything

582
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,280
about what I would say
before I drank it.

583
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,280
Which is...
that Bud Light Lime tastes

584
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,160
like Jolly Green Giant's
ejaculate.

585
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,520
It tastes like the Great Gazoo
urinating in a public pool...

586
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,200
or a lime Jolly Rancher fished out
of Mickey Rourke's mouth.

587
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,280
But, look,
if I'm gonna do this,

588
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,920
I'm not gonna do it small.
I'm gonna do it properly.

589
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So please come with me.
It's a cool party !

590
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,720
Where cool people are having
a good time. Thank you very much.

591
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,200
So here we go.
Bud Light Lime may taste

592
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,280
like your tongue
is angry with you,

593
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,680
but after seeing Sepp Blatter
leaving, to me it tastes...

594
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,600
Delicious !

595
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,880
That's our show.
A reminder,

596
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,200
we're on Trinidad
at 9:01 p.m. Tuesday.

597
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,280
See you next week.
Good night !

598
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,400
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

599
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,920
