00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,960
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,280
Season II,
Episode 27

3
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,160
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight" !

4
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,400
Thank you so much
for joining us.

5
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,520
I'm John Oliver. Just time
for a quick recap of the week

6
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,440
and we begin in Michigan,

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,440
the giant hand holding Detroit back
from trying to fight Canada.

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,040
This week, Michigan had
some political drama.

9
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,080
After a 14-hour session
at the state House,

10
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,760
Representatives Todd Courser and
Cindy Gamrat are no longer in office.

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,080
Representative Courser
announced his resignation.

12
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,880
This was at 3:12 this morning,
during that marathon session.

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,880
And then,
just about an hour later,

14
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,960
the House voted to expel
Representative Gamrat.

15
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,480
Kicked out of the state House
at 4:00 in the morning.

16
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,000
That is the legislative equivalent

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,440
of throwing all their shit out
on the lawn.

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,560
And let me explain
to you why they did that.

19
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,920
It's because these two staunch,
family-values Republicans

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,920
were fucking each other,

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,240
and according
to those in their office,

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,840
they were not being
that discreet about it.

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,240
There had been rumors about an
affair between the two of them

24
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,720
swirling around Lansing
for quite some time.

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,240
The staffers said that they spent
a lot of time in their back offices,

26
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,440
which are shut off
from the rest of the office.

27
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,920
She would bring him a pillow
and tuck him in, and a blanket.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,400
They would take long walks
together during the day.

29
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,680
They would have these long, personal,
romantic hugs during the day.

30
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,440
Two things there.
First, no hug is romantic.

31
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,960
A hug is a brief high-five

32
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,200
between two sets of ideally
disinterested genitals.

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,720
And second, did you just say
she would tuck him in ?

34
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,960
Because that's gross.
Don't creep everyone out

35
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,280
with your weird Christian-rock
version of infidelity.

36
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,080
Just fuck like
normal terrible people.

37
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,120
So far, this is just
a run-of-the-mill sex scandal,

38
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,000
but this story starts to get
amazing when you learn

39
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,880
how Representative Courser attempted
to throw people off the scent.

40
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,040
State Rep Ted Courser admitted
to circulating an anonymous email

41
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,080
claiming he had been caught
with a male prostitute.

42
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,160
He did this apparently
in order to muddy the water

43
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,760
in case his affair with a fellow
state rep was exposed.

44
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,280
It's true. He sent an anonymous email
accusing himself

45
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,880
of a fake liaison
with a male prostitute

46
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,320
so no one would believe
the real liaisons he was having

47
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,880
with his own colleague.

48
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,240
That is the worst plan
I've ever heard,

49
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,080
and I'm including
trickle-down economics,

50
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,680
the pull-out method and the plot
of "The Parent Trap".

51
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,680
It gets better.
In his fake email,

52
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,400
Courser accuses himself of,
and I quote,

53
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,520
"male on male paid for sex behind
a prominent Lansing nightclub".

54
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,000
Which is already magnificent.

55
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,840
Only the best Lansing nightclub
for his fake gay hookup.

56
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,880
He then attacks himself

57
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,160
for being a bisexual,
porn-addicted sex deviant.

58
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,800
But it gets still better,

59
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,720
because the only reason we know
Courser wrote the email

60
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,240
is that one of his aides secretly
recorded him explaining his plan.

61
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,600
So, please enjoy
Todd Courser reading a draft

62
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,960
of his lurid email
to a bemused staffer.

63
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,280
His cock is hanging out all over
Lansing since the election.

64
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,680
Are you serious ? What are you
talking about ? That's ridiculous.

65
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,040
I have to say,
Todd Courser may have lost his job,

66
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,920
but he might have a bright future
as a Midwestern erotica author.

67
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,760
"His cock was hanging out
all over Lansing."

68
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,480
"His balls were as heavy
as the prize-winning pumpkins"

69
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,360
"at the Michigan State Fair."

70
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,320
"She was as wet as the waterwheel
at the Franklin Cider Mill, Michigan."

71
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,040
Unbelievably, as a local
news station suggested,

72
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,480
this may not even be the first time
that Courser has orchestrated

73
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,680
a poisonous attack on himself
for political gain.

74
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,080
There are now
new allegations that Courser

75
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,640
put out an attack ad that read
"Is Todd Courser a child molester ?".

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,480
He allegedly did this to gain sympathy
votes before the primary elections.

77
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,720
What ?

78
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,120
If that's true, it's not Todd
Courser that I'm worried about,

79
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,840
it's the Michigan voters
who saw that ad and thought,

80
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,440
"A man who's been falsely accused
of child molestation can't be all bad."

81
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,280
"He's got my vote."

82
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,200
So, let's move on to Guatemala,
a country you think about so little,

83
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,920
we're just going to leave up a map
of Central America

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,160
and make you look up
which one it is. Crack a book.

85
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,400
I'm not here to spoon-feed you
"What's Guatemala".

86
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,920
Last Sunday, Guatemala had an
election under unusual circumstances.

87
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,160
Polls have opened in Guatemala
to elect a new president

88
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,920
after months of political turmoil.

89
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,480
It follows weeks of protests

90
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,480
and the resignation
of President Otto PÃ©rez Molina,

91
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,840
who was subsequently jailed
on corruption charges.

92
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,000
Their president
stepped down in shame

93
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,480
despite the fact he only had
four days left in office.

94
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,040
And usually, to leave office
so unceremoniously,

95
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,800
your cock has to be hanging out
all over Lansing, Michigan.

96
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,840
Now, in this week's election,

97
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,800
no candidate got enough votes
to win outright,

98
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,800
but the leading vote-getter
was a bit of a surprise.

99
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,080
Ballot counting went on overnight

100
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,520
and showed a wealthy businessman
and a former first lady both trailing

101
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,840
former TV comic Jimmy Morales,

102
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,280
who has never held
political office.

103
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,040
What you're seeing there is his days
of playing the character of a countryman

104
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,480
who almost became president.
It was a role he played.

105
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,720
Hey, I have absolutely
no problem with that.

106
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,600
Playing a role is as good
as real-world experience.

107
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,160
That is why, if our planet is
ever threatened,

108
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,480
we should send
Bruce Willis into space.

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,960
In fact, even if our planet
isn't threatened,

110
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,960
we should send
Bruce Willis into space.

111
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,440
That's the plan.

112
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,920
Now, there is going to be
a run-off election

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,280
in Guatemala in October,

114
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,920
but the people there seem less
than optimistic about their future.

115
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,720
I'm voting, but I don't agree with any
of the proposals from the candidates.

116
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,120
We only want the new president
to not be as bad as the last one.

117
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,240
Those are some low standards.

118
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,600
In fact, one of Jimmy Morales'
actual campaign slogans

119
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,960
was "neither corrupt nor a thief".

120
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,400
And it seems Guatemalans'
standard for presidents have now fallen

121
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,480
to the level of what Americans ask
of a Craigslist roommate.

122
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,880
"Look, just don't
steal my shit,"

123
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,040
"and I will pretend not to notice
that you watch me sleeping."

124
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,880
And finally tonight, the UK,
the only two letters that promise

125
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,760
more iciness and bad food
than these two.

126
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,400
Now, this week, the United Kingdom
experienced a moment of history.

127
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,320
Well, a lifetime achievement today
for Queen Elizabeth.

128
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,600
She is now Britain's
longest-serving monarch.

129
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,240
That's right. Elizabeth II has
the title of longest-serving queen.

130
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,120
Although the title
of fiercest queen still goes

131
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,480
to New York's own Kelsey Glamour.
You go, Kelsey !

132
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,360
You own that stage !

133
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,160
The queen marked her special day
by opening a train line in Scotland,

134
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,480
which one correspondent
used a little too well as a metaphor

135
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,320
for what she has actually achieved.

136
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,960
While the train used to inaugurate
the new line was a rolling anachronism,

137
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,120
she, somehow,
at 89 years old, is not.

138
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,520
But this day wasn't
about a train.

139
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,560
It was about a queen who
just keeps chugging along.

140
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,640
You cannot compare
Queen Elizabeth to a train.

141
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,560
For one thing,
people need trains.

142
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,800
Trains still serve a practical purpose
in the modern era.

143
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,960
You're being mean to trains.

144
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,440
That was the second most inadvertently
dismissive thing that reporter said.

145
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,240
In 63 years
and 216 days on the job,

146
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,720
you learn a thing or two
about how to do it.

147
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,000
If the requirement
is to be seen,

148
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,440
wear bright clothes
and a big hat

149
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,440
and try to look like
you're enjoying yourself.

150
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,280
She's standing
right behind you !

151
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,400
I know it's hard to tell,

152
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,720
because she's pointless, but still !

153
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,120
I will say, for the record, she has
not done too well over the years

154
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,680
in the whole "try to look like
you're enjoying yourself" department.

155
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,600
Her resting expression
is total contempt.

156
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,640
But you cannot deny,

157
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,960
she has worn the shit
out of a lot of hats,

158
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,320
from this one which resembles
the bar mitzvah cake

159
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,840
of Scarsdale's
youngest Prince fan,

160
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,240
to this one, which is what a Las Vegas
clown would wear

161
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,800
to space church,

162
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,360
to this one, apparently constructed
from the receipts

163
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,480
of all the stupid hats
she's ever bought

164
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,600
fashioned into
an even stupider hat.

165
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,120
Essentially, what I'm saying is,
congratulations, Your Majesty.

166
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,520
You have spent
63 years doing a job

167
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,120
that could've effectively been done
by a Styrofoam mold of a human head.

168
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,240
And now this.

169
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,360
Some more descriptions of the Queen's
ridiculous hats.

170
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,480
A baby Smurf's
uncircumcised penis,

171
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,680
what mold thinks about
when it masturbates,

172
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,400
the exact thing a 19th-century
French prostitute would wear

173
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,320
to Tim Burton's funeral,

174
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,000
a hairball vomited up
by Britain's least-healthy cat,

175
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,160
a dollop of sour cream
attending the Academy Awards,

176
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,800
a penis that's literally died
of embarrassment

177
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,200
and fettuccine Alfredo.

178
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,080
Moving on.
Our main story tonight...

179
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,360
Our main story tonight
concerns public defenders,

180
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,000
the only people who appear in court
more frequently

181
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,480
than former child stars.

182
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,160
Even if you have never come into
contact with a public defender,

183
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,360
you will know them from their cameo
in the Miranda warning speech.

184
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,680
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to an attorney.

185
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,440
You have the right to an attorney.

186
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,840
- You have the right to an attorney.
- What is this shit ?

187
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,600
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can't afford an attorney,

188
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,080
we will provide you with the dumbest
fucking lawyer on Earth !

189
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,080
I have the right
to an attorney, too !

190
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,800
And if I can't afford one,

191
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,560
one must be provided
for me by the court !

192
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,760
Yes, apparently,
even Garfield knows

193
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,080
he has the right
to a public defender.

194
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,600
And he's going to need one, too,
because he just murdered a lasagna.

195
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,280
And a person.

196
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,560
The right to a lawyer is a pillar
of American jurisprudence,

197
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,440
but it's a right that
we've only had since 1963,

198
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,480
when the Supreme Court ruled

199
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,400
that "any person who is
too poor to hire a lawyer"

200
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,440
"cannot be assured a fair trial
unless a lawyer is provided for him."

201
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,920
It's an idea so obvious,

202
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,400
you can't believe there was ever
a time that we didn't have it,

203
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,960
like corn-on-the-cob holders that
are shaped like corn on the cobs.

204
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,800
They're essential to
the fabric of American life.

205
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,680
But our public defender system
is massively overburdened.

206
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,760
Depending on the jurisdiction,

207
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,440
anywhere from 60-90% of criminal
defendants need

208
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,160
a publicly-funded attorney,

209
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,120
and the system is creaking
under that weight.

210
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,800
There are about 20 public defenders
handling up to 250 cases.

211
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,920
In New Orleans, for example,

212
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,400
each public defender handles
roughly 350 cases a year.

213
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,960
Public defenders in Fresno County
often work

214
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,520
on a thousand cases a year
when state guidelines say

215
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,480
they shouldn't be doing
more than 150.

216
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,320
A thousand cases in a year.

217
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,800
That's nearly
three cases per day.

218
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,040
Those are Gerard Depardieu
wine consumption numbers.

219
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,680
At breakfast.
And with caseloads that heavy,

220
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,040
public defenders cannot possibly
prepare an effective defense.

221
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,240
A study in New Orleans found

222
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,520
that the city had some part-time
defenders who could only spend

223
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,880
an average of seven minutes
per case,

224
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,760
and that is not long enough
to prepare anything.

225
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,160
If I only had seven minutes
to prepare this show,

226
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,080
I definitely would not be talking about
public defenders right now.

227
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,320
I'd be desperately
trying to fill time

228
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,360
by listing the Muppets
in order of fuckability.

229
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,160
And I'll do it now.
Fozzie first, obviously.

230
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,560
Most attractive thing
is a sense of humor.

231
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,520
Then you've got to go Rowlf.

232
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,640
Then you know what ?
I'm going Swedish Chef,

233
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,280
and I'm finishing up
with Sam the Eagle,

234
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,040
'cause you know he's
into some freaky business.

235
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,720
Freaky. And look, this is just
the beginning of the problem.

236
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,040
Some places don't even have
a public defender's office

237
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,760
and some counties just contract cases
out in bulk to the lowest bidder.

238
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,200
At its worst, this can result
in a system

239
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,000
known as "meet'em and plead'em",

240
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,000
where the vast majority of defendants
plead out and don't go to trial.

241
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,480
90-95% of all criminal cases,
state and federal,

242
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,600
are resolved by plea bargaining.

243
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,480
Now, just think about that.

244
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,960
About 95% of criminal cases
never make it to trial.

245
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,480
If "Law & Order"
reflected reality,

246
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,040
their episodes
would be pretty short.

247
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,560
It'd basically be:
"How does your client plead ?"

248
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,440
"Guilty, Your Honor."
And then this.

249
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,920
And as a viewer, you would justifiably
feel cheated by that.

250
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,880
And look, it is easy
not to care about this

251
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,560
and assume that if someone is being
represented by a public defender,

252
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,600
they're probably guilty,
but many are not.

253
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,240
And some only plead because they
feel they have no alternative.

254
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,040
Look at Erma Faye Stewart.

255
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,200
She was arrested in a drug sweep
but claimed she was innocent.

256
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,280
She faced a 10-year sentence
and was stuck in jail

257
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,800
because she couldn't afford bail.

258
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,560
She said her court-appointed lawyer
urged her to take a plea deal

259
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,440
and she reluctantly agreed.

260
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:44,080
I asked him: "Listen now, I can plead
for a five-year probation."

261
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,800
"Just let me go home to my kids."

262
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,520
She admitted to a crime
she denies committing

263
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,880
just to spend time with her children.
That is horrifying.

264
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,080
Especially because I would
be willing to commit a crime

265
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,320
just to not have to
spend time with any children.

266
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,240
They are loud cesspools of bacteria
with nothing interesting to say.

267
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,800
You want to grow up
and be a princess ?

268
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,160
I'll tell you what happens
to princesses, Ashley.

269
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,600
Google "Diana plus truth".
Do it. Do it. Google it.

270
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,560
Google it, Ashley.
Open your eyes !

271
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,880
Being a princess
ain't fun, Ashley !

272
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,480
Now, after Erma pled guilty,
the prosecution's case collapsed,

273
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,000
and the other defendants
had their charges dropped.

274
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,000
But Erma could not
take her plea back.

275
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,400
So, she had to spend
five years on probation

276
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,320
during which she was ineligible
for some form of public assistance

277
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,760
and wound up homeless.

278
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,640
That is the problem with a system that
can allot as little as seven minutes

279
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,440
to helping people make decisions
that can be life changing.

280
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,280
Our public defender system
is dangerously under-resourced.

281
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,360
One report found out that 40%
of all county-based public defenders

282
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,440
have no investigators on staff.

283
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,480
That's 40% of lawyers forced to sit
at their desks googling,

284
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,400
"Where to get exonerating evidence ?"
and hitting "I'm feeling lucky".

285
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,720
And the offices those desks are in
could potentially lack

286
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,320
basic standards of workplace
health and safety.

287
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,200
Tough to do your job when you're
knee-deep in roaches.

288
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,800
But that is the case for employees
at Augusta's public defender's office.

289
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,920
It's so bad that the office
had to close early today.

290
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,040
And this infestation
is nothing new.

291
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,360
No, it's been going on
for four years.

292
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,880
That office is getting
to a point where roaches

293
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,520
are outnumbering the lawyers.

294
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,560
If the roaches don't have law degrees
from the University of Roachester

295
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,600
and can't help take on some clients,
that's going to be a problem.

296
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,800
As for New Orleans,
their public defender's office

297
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,440
has actually put up
a crowd-funding page

298
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,920
to help make up
their budget shortfall,

299
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,160
and it's currently only
raised 19% of its goal.

300
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,960
And look,
nobody should be in jail

301
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,960
because a Kickstarter
didn't meet its goal.

302
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:09,440
Some people should be in jail because
a Kickstarter did meet its goal,

303
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,960
like this one for an actual giant
inflatable Lionel Richie head.

304
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,640
You two gentlemen should be locked up
all night long.

305
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,840
All night, all night,
all night long.

306
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:27,040
Al night, all night,
hey, jamba, jamba.

307
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,320
But despite all these
enormous challenges,

308
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,920
there are still some amazing lawyers,
like Travis Williams.

309
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,320
He frames every acquittal
and puts it on his wall,

310
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,320
but guess where
he puts his losses.

311
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,320
I'm gonna get the last name
of every case I've lost

312
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,440
tattooed on my back.
Right now it's only five.

313
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,280
Hopefully, I won't
fill my back up.

314
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,280
That's the goal. But since the wins
go on the wall,

315
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,080
I decided the losses go on my back,
'cause I won't forget them.

316
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,520
He tattoos the names of the cases
he's lost on his back.

317
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,200
That is a truly heroic lawyer.

318
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,640
He's like Atticus Finch,

319
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,440
only real and not, as it
turns out, a horrible racist.

320
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,120
Screw you, Finchy !
Go fuck a mockingbird !

321
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,360
The point is, many public defenders
do heroic work

322
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,240
despite facing overwhelming
institutional obstacles,

323
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,640
including this incredible incident
involving a Florida judge.

324
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,480
Stop pissing me off.
Just sit down.

325
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,840
I don't need your help.

326
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,760
I'm the public defender.
I have the right to be here.

327
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,560
I said sit down !

328
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,800
If you want to fight,
let's go out back.

329
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,480
Let's go now.

330
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,560
You want to fuck with me ?
Do you ?

331
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,000
Now, that is clearly a disgrace,

332
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,200
although I will say,
fights like that would make jury duty

333
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,960
a lot more interesting.

334
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,040
We've reached a verdict.

335
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,240
We find the proceedings
to be fucking awesome !

336
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,320
Incidentally, that judge
returned to the courtroom

337
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,000
and called seven cases without
the public defender being present,

338
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,920
and he's still on the bench.

339
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
A bad judge can come and go,

340
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,880
as the head of programming
at NBC will tell you,

341
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,680
but access to a lawyer is supposed
to be a constitutional right,

342
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,840
and it is increasingly
under threat.

343
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,520
For instance, in four states,

344
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,680
you can make so little that
you qualify for food stamps

345
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,080
but still not be poor enough
to get state-funded representation.

346
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,080
And in at least 43 states,

347
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,520
you can be billed
for a public defender,

348
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,360
meaning in these states,
we have a system where, conceivably,

349
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,080
if you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you,

350
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,800
provided that you pay that attorney.
Which is absurd !

351
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,360
You can't tell people something's free
and then charge them for it.

352
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,240
This is the American judicial system,
not Candy Crush.

353
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,720
And for what this can look like
on a human level,

354
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,880
meet Larry Thompson.

355
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,080
In 2010, he was arrested in Florida
for driving with a revoked license,

356
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,480
which was a felony charge

357
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,080
because he'd had multiple
driving violations before.

358
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,160
Larry was sent to jail where
he applied for a public defender,

359
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,200
which in Florida, incredibly, requires
a 50 dollar application fee.

360
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,960
He couldn't afford
to pay that or his bail,

361
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,360
so he was stuck
in jail for 59 days,

362
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,280
at which point he gave up
and pled no contest to get out,

363
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,200
and was released
on time served.

364
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,240
But, in Florida, if you use a public
defender and are found guilty,

365
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,200
even by plea, you then owe
attorney's fees and costs

366
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,400
regardless of your ability to pay.

367
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,400
Larry now owed not just the 50 dollar
public defender application fee,

368
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,160
but also an extra 100 dollar fee
for having used the public defender

369
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,240
and even another fee of 100 dollars
to pay the prosecution's costs,

370
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,760
which is like a bully
taking your lunch money

371
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,520
and then charging you an additional
lunch-money reallocation fee.

372
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,280
On top of those and other fees
for the crime he pled no contest to,

373
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,680
the court then added
partial-payment fees each month

374
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,160
for the next several months,
bringing Larry's tab to 675 dollars.

375
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,160
And that all brings us
to about a month ago,

376
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,320
when Larry was actually arrested
for contempt of court

377
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,200
as a result of not
paying those fees,

378
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,160
an arrest, incidentally,
for which they charged him

379
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,120
a 210 dollars administrative fee.

380
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,440
They may as well have just
slapped on an irony fee,

381
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,520
'cause it turns out
having no money in Florida

382
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,640
can be really
fucking expensive.

383
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,480
And one more thing.
When they arrested Larry,

384
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,080
he was receiving hospice care
for a terminal pulmonary condition

385
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,360
and was so ill, the jail was forced
to send him to the hospital

386
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,240
where he was watched
by two guards

387
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,840
and chained by his ankles
to his hospital bed.

388
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,000
Luckily, he was
eventually released

389
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,360
and his debt was paid by donors,

390
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,800
but he still, understandably,
could not quite believe

391
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,920
what had just happened to him.

392
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,040
I never knew they would actually
arrest a person in my condition

393
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,280
for not being able to pay money,
because I have to pay rent.

394
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,000
So, I can't see them keep
arresting me over and over

395
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,000
and taking me back to jail
and charging me 250 more dollars

396
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,360
that I have to agree to
or else I'm sitting in jail,

397
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,320
when I can't get oxygen
in jail like I need it.

398
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,320
So, they are actually
issuing me a disservice.

399
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,800
None of this makes any sense.
It doesn't even make fiscal sense,

400
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,240
because the state of Florida
did collect the 885 dollars

401
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,600
that Larry owed them,

402
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,880
but they spent thousands of dollars
needlessly imprisoning him,

403
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,440
and, surely, Florida could've
used that money

404
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,640
for something they badly need,
like rehab programs

405
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,120
for meth-addicted
swamp raccoons.

406
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,560
I'm assuming, accurately.

407
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,600
But the point is,

408
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,720
50 years after the Supreme Court
gave everyone

409
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,280
the fundamental right to an attorney,
even if you can't afford one,

410
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,040
the most vulnerable people are
potentially being charged for access

411
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,120
to a hideously broken system.

412
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,120
And we either need to fix that

413
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,520
or at the very least update
the Miranda warning in our cop shows

414
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,040
to reflect reality.

415
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,840
Freeze !

416
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,480
You have the right
to remain silent.

417
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,400
Anything you say can and will be used
against you.

418
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,000
- If you cannot afford an attorney...
- One will be provided for you.

419
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,360
- I get it !
- We're not done !

420
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,600
I'm not done.

421
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,040
I'm not finished.

422
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,320
That attorney may have
300 other cases

423
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,120
that he or she is working on.

424
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,560
- That's not a joke.
- Literally, 300 other cases.

425
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,960
They could have only seven minutes
to prepare your defense.

426
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,000
Do you know how short
seven minutes is ?

427
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,640
Billy Joel's "Scenes
from an Italian Restaurant"

428
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,760
is 37 seconds longer
than that.

429
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,040
"Bottle of red..."

430
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,480
That attorney may be exhausted,
unable to think straight.

431
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,360
And grossly underpaid.

432
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,960
Or working in an office
full of cockroaches.

433
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,680
You know what really blows ?

434
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,760
That attorney may pressure you
to take a guilty plea.

435
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,560
Statistically, there's a 90-plus percent
chance that you will take that plea.

436
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,640
That attorney may get challenged
to a fight by a judge.

437
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,480
- That happened.
- Guess where.

438
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,760
- I don't know.
- Guess !

439
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,520
- Florida ?
- How could it not be Florida ?

440
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,240
One more thing. That attorney that
was provided for you may not be free.

441
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,360
If you lose,
you may have to pay 'em.

442
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,560
- You might have to pay the prosecutor.
- Is that constitutional ?

443
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,200
It's constitutional as fuck !

444
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,880
You piece of shit !

445
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,480
Assuming we can pay for that lawyer.
How's the Kickstarter campaign doing ?

446
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,800
- Not even close.
- Not good at all.

447
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,160
Do you understand your rights ?

448
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,840
- No.
- What ?

449
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,040
No.

450
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,960
Basically... you're fucked.

451
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,080
And now this.

452
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,160
An important message from
our Lady of Perpetual Exemption.

453
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,560
Greetings, brothers
and sisters. Praise be unto you.

454
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,120
It is I,
Mega Reverend John Oliver,

455
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,800
and I am joined by my bewitching wife,
Wanda Jo.

456
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,840
Praise be.

457
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,720
Praise be, Wanda.
Now, just a few weeks ago,

458
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,600
Wanda Jo and I spoke to you
from these very chairs

459
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,000
and we asked you
to sow a seed of faith

460
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,840
and donate to our church.

461
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,400
And like God
and the story of Noah,

462
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,680
you took one look at what we wrought
and you done made it rain.

463
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,560
Indeed. Behold the bounty
that you have sown upon us.

464
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,720
You sent in,
and this is true,

465
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,080
tens of thousands of dollars,

466
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,360
mostly in single dollar bills,
which was a little annoying.

467
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,440
- This ain't a strip club.
- Exactly. Exactly.

468
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,160
We ain't running a change machine
in a laundromat !

469
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,960
However, I am sorry
to report to you that tonight,

470
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,520
we are closing down
the church.

471
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,800
No, no, no.
Not because we have to.

472
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,200
We have still
not broken any laws

473
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,360
by promising you untold riches
in return for sending us money.

474
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,240
It's a miracle !

475
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,440
We are also not closing down

476
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,800
because you kept sending us
actual seeds,

477
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,880
even though we explicitly
told you not to.

478
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,320
We ain't interested
in your seeds !

479
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,160
That's right.
Nor are we closing down

480
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,240
because someone
sent us 12 bobbleheads

481
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,960
of Minnesota Timberwolves'
flameout Jonny Flynn,

482
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,360
which, let's be honest,
is at least 11 too many.

483
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,600
The T-wolves had Ricky Rubio.
Why get another point guard for ?

484
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,200
That's a solid
basketball point, Wanda.

485
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,680
And for the record, it also has
absolutely nothing to do

486
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,560
with the fact that
someone sent a T-shirt

487
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,760
reading "John Oliver Is
a Rat Faced Bastard".

488
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,920
Which, I'll be honest, is starting
to hurt my feelings a bit.

489
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,920
- It ain't a rat face.
- Thank you, Wanda.

490
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,080
It's more like a vole face.
Or a parrot,

491
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,160
or a marginally
handsome weasel.

492
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,360
Thank you, you're very kind.

493
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,520
We're not even shutting down
because someone sent

494
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,160
this four-foot carved
wooden penis

495
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,520
with a sign attached to it,
reading:

496
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,040
"Rub this for
the seed you seek !"

497
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,760
No. That's not even why.

498
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,800
The reason we are shutting
this church down

499
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,320
is we received
a different kind of seed.

500
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,120
We received not one,
not two, not three,

501
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,960
but four packages containing
jars and/or vials of semen.

502
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,480
And some looked fake,
but others did not.

503
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,720
We live our lives
by one hard and fast rule.

504
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,880
When someone sends you
jizz through the mail,

505
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,160
it's time to stop doing
whatever you're doing.

506
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,680
So, we are shutting this shit down.
Shut it down, boys.

507
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,240
Shut this shit down.
And I'll tell you why.

508
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,280
Because setting up churches
is all fun and games

509
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,160
until someone gets sperm
in an envelope.

510
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,480
We don't want your
homemade Go-Gurt !

511
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,800
We do not want
your Penis Grigio !

512
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,720
No, no, leave this.
I'm keeping this one.

513
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,960
This is why you cannot
have nice things.

514
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,440
So we are shuttering up
Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption

515
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,200
and we will be giving all the money
to Doctors Without Borders.

516
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,360
And why are we doing this, Wanda ?

517
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,280
Leave it alone. It's mine.

518
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,080
We're doing this 'cause
we ain't interested in your seed !

519
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,280
Exactly. All of this is over !

520
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,240
Do not send us
anything anymore.

521
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,920
If you want to send money to a fake
church, send it to Scientology.

522
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,720
Now, that's our show.
We'll be back in two weeks' time.

523
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,240
Good night !

524
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,120
No, no ! You're not
taking this. No !

525
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,960
It's constitutional as fuck,
you piece of shit !

526
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,000
It's constitutional as fuck,
you piece of shit !

527
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,320
It is constitutional
as fuck !

528
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,000
It's constitutional as fuck !

529
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,800
It's constitutional as fuck,
you piece of shit !

530
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,920
It's constitutional as fuck,
you piece of shit !

531
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,640
