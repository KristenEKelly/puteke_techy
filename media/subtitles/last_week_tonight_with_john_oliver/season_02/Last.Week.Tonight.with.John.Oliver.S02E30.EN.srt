LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,240
Series II
Episode 30

3
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,240
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight" !

4
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,960
Thank you so much for joining us.
I'm John Oliver.

5
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,000
Just time for a quick recap
of the week,

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,880
and we begin
with Justin Bieber's penis.

7
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,560
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
I would never do that to you.

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,040
We begin with Syria. Much better.

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,200
Last week, we talked about Russia's
decision to get involved in Syria

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,360
and the potential mess
that would follow.

11
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,680
Well, this week,
it nearly got a lot messier.

12
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,680
Russian warships firing
cruise missiles

13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,720
at what it says
are ISIS targets in Syria.

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,240
CNN has learned at least four

15
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,800
of the more than two dozen Russian
cruise missiles

16
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,080
launched from ships in the Caspian Sea
crashed in Iran.

17
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,200
Holy shit !

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,200
It seems Russia might have
accidentally bombed Iran.

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,600
And there is simply no edible
arrangement big enough

20
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,120
to smooth that
international incident over.

21
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,520
It can't be done.

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,160
Now Russia...
Russia denies this story,

23
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,120
but whether it's true or not, they're,
frankly, not the only ones

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,640
whose Syrian strategy is
not working out as planned,

25
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,120
because America had an embarrassing
revelation of its own this week.

26
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,360
The US is making a stunning change

27
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,240
to one of its central efforts
to stop ISIS in Syria.

28
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,040
It's suspending its
half-billion dollar program

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,200
to train up to 5,000
rebel fighters each year.

30
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,440
The program fell
far short of its goals.

31
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,040
Wait. "Short of its goals."

32
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,320
That is an understatement on par with
"Tim Burton likes Johnny Depp."

33
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,120
Yeah. Yeah, he likes him.
He likes him just fine.

34
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,640
The Pentagon's plan had been to
train more than 15,000 fighters,

35
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,360
but as of this July, it had only
trained and deployed 54 recruits,

36
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,960
many of whom have since been captured
or abandoned the fight.

37
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,480
And last month, we learned
how many are actually left.

38
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,960
Can you tell us what the total number
of trained fighters remains ?

39
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,800
It's a small number, and the ones that
are in the fight, is

40
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,440
is... we're talking four or five.

41
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,800
Four or five ? That's not good.

42
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,000
That is not only not enough
guys to destroy ISIS,

43
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,600
that's probably not enough to destroy
a six-foot party sub.

44
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,200
And it is, generally, not a great sign
for your rebel forces

45
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,200
if they can all go out to dinner

46
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,080
and the restaurant won't
automatically add gratuity.

47
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,280
That's a pretty good rule.

48
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,280
So, let's move on now to FIFA,

49
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,200
the reason that my mouth tastes like a
lime crawled in and shat itself.

50
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,320
FIFA's leader, Sepp Blatter, has been
under pressure for months now.

51
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,080
First the US indicted
many of FIFA's top officials,

52
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,000
then the Swiss opened a criminal
investigation against Blatter,

53
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,760
and this week, FIFA's ethics committee
finally stepped in.

54
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,320
FIFA president Sepp Blatter
has been suspended for 90 days

55
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,760
as part of an corruption investigation
of football's governing body.

56
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,520
Wait, I'm sorry. You only
suspended him 90 days ?

57
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,720
That is ludicrously short.

58
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,720
If he put a Greek yogurt in the break
room fridge the day he was suspended,

59
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,400
it could conceivably still be
edible when he gets back.

60
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,200
Although, to be fair, it will probably
be gone, and I'll tell you why.

61
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,000
Janice in accounting
don't give a fuck !

62
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,400
But even this minor suspension
was too much for Sepp Blatter,

63
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,200
who was actually called
for an investigation

64
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,200
into the FIFA ethics committee
investigation.

65
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,200
Which is basically standing up in the
middle of an intervention and going,

66
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,640
"You know what ? Fuck all of you !
You've got a drinking problem !

67
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,200
You've got drinking problems ! How do
you like them apples ?"

68
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,920
The problem is, Blatter's suspension
leaves a vacuum at the top of FIFA.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,760
And you'd expect someone like
Secretary General Jerome Valcke

70
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,400
or Vice President Michel Platini
to keep things steady while he's gone.

71
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,480
However, there is
a bit of a problem with that.

72
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,600
Also suspended from
all football activity are

73
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,200
Secretary General Jerome Valcke and
Vice President Michel Platini

74
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,240
who faces questions over a 2
million-dollar payment from Blatter.

75
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,920
It turns out they were both suspended
because of course they were !

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,160
They worked under Sepp Blatter,

77
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,040
and he is the PepÃ© Le Pew of soccer.

78
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,520
Boundaryless, aggressively European,

79
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,200
and if you're anywhere near him, his
stink will get all over you.

80
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,800
FIFA also cannot turn to former vice
presidents Chung Mong-Joon

81
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,200
or Jack Warner because they've been
barred for six years and life.

82
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,920
So the current acting president of
FIFA is Isa Hayatou,

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,200
head of the African
FIFA Confederation.

84
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,840
And if you're thinking, "Good.
This is the guy to clean up FIFA,"

85
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,240
there's just one extra thing
you should probably know.

86
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,160
Senior Vice President Isa Hayatou now
fills in for Blatter,

87
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,080
although he's previously faced
allegations

88
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,000
of taking a bribe
from the Qatar World Cup bid.

89
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,200
Of course he's fought allegations of
his own ! Of course he did.

90
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,680
And at this point,
I think it's becoming clear,

91
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,480
if FIFA wants to find Blatter's
successor within its own ranks,

92
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,920
it'll be like finding a Porta-Potty
at a music festival:

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,200
None of them are likely to be clean,

94
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,680
so the best you're hoping for is
to find one

95
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,520
that's the least covered in shit.

96
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,480
And finally tonight
finally tonight, we move on...

97
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,240
We move on to Toyota,

98
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,240
makers of the '92 Camry where you got
your first backseat hand job.

99
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,120
Toyota is famous for making
dependable vehicles,

100
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
but this week, we learned
something surprising

101
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,640
about who exactly
has been depending on them.

102
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,200
The United States wants
Toyota to explain

103
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,600
how ISIS is getting their hands on so
many Toyota trucks and SUVs.

104
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,080
Their propaganda videos
show convoys made up

105
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,040
mostly of Toyota HiLux pickups
and Land Cruisers.

106
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,720
And now ABC News has learned

107
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,200
that a US Treasury
counter-terrorism unit

108
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,160
is asking Toyota to help them
determine how so many of its trucks,

109
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,160
both newer and older models, have
ended up in the hands of ISIS.

110
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,120
Yes, it seems that Toyotas are being
used as instruments of death,

111
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,880
which is, it's a bold move, because,
traditionally, "death on wheels"

112
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,200
has very much been GM's brand.

113
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,000
Now... That's kind of their area.

114
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,680
Now, as you would expect,

115
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,160
Toyota is claiming to be baffled as
to how this has occurred.

116
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,800
Toyota says it doesn't know how ISIS
is getting its hands on these trucks.

117
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,440
That's right, David. In a statement to
ABC News, Toyota says it is not aware

118
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,200
of any of its dealerships
violating the company policy

119
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,920
not to sell to terrorist groups.

120
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,600
Hold... Hold on, hold on.

121
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,160
You actually felt the need to make

122
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,960
not selling to terrorists
official company policy ?

123
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,800
Is that in the handbook under "Things
that should go without saying" ?

124
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,600
So, don't sell to terrorists,

125
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,720
don't accept magic beans as payment,

126
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,600
and don't sell to a cat who walks in
with a ruby in its mouth.

127
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,600
Brian ?
Brian, what are you trying to do,

128
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,640
selling a Yaris to that cat
with a ruby in its mouth ?

129
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,120
You can't do that, Brian.

130
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,080
I don't care if it's a cash offer.

131
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,320
The amazing thing is
this is not a new story.

132
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,440
Terrorist groups love Toyota vehicles.

133
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,200
Back in 2001,
"The New York Times" reported

134
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,200
that Osama bin Laden likes
Toyota Land Cruisers,

135
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,200
and "Newsweek" once ran a story called

136
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,400
"Why Rebel Groups
Love the Toyota HiLux."

137
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,520
And in the light
of this news this week,

138
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,040
you would think Toyota would at least

139
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,200
change the name of one of their cars.

140
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,920
Incidentally, Toyota does sell
a make of car called the Isis.

141
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,800
Come on, Toyota !

142
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,920
You're giving ISIS
built-in vanity plates !

143
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,880
It seems Toyota might have
a genuine problem here,

144
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,720
because by the looks of it, ISIS seems
to really like their cars.

145
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,320
Other brands like Mitsubishi,
Hyundai, and Isuzu

146
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,800
have also been spotted
in these ISIS videos,

147
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,440
but nothing even remotely close

148
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,920
to the amount of Toyota vehicles.

149
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,280
In fact, a former
US ambassador to the UN

150
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,080
told ABC News that regrettably,

151
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,080
Toyota has almost become
part of the ISIS brand.

152
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,680
Wow. At this rate, we are
just a few months away

153
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,200
from ISIS-owned Toyota dealerships,

154
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,120
complete with fully armed
wind sock guy.

155
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Come on down to ISIS Toyota !

156
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,560
Our salesmen are terrorists
you can negotiate with.

157
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,760
And now, this.

158
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,800
And now, John McCain's favorite joke.

159
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,200
It's been a week since the election.
How ya doin' ?

160
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,200
Well, I've been sleeping like a baby.

161
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,200
Sleep two hours, wake up and cry.

162
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,080
Sleep two hours, wake up and cry.

163
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,200
I slept like a baby.

164
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,320
Sleep two hours, wake up and cry.

165
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,240
Sleep two hours, wake up and cry...

166
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,160
After we lost the election,
I slept like a baby.

167
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,600
Sleep two hours, wake up and cry.
Sleep two hours, wake up and cry.

168
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,800
Sleep two hours, wake up and cry.

169
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,360
Sleep two hours, wake up and cry.

170
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,400
After I lost, I slept like a baby.

171
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,200
Sleep two hours,
wake up and cry.

172
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,680
Sleep two hours, wake up and cry.

173
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,000
And one from before
he even lost.

174
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,680
Slept like a baby.

175
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,800
Sleep two hours, wake up and cry.

176
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,120
Moving on.

177
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,000
Our main story tonight
is about North Dakota,

178
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,320
or as you may know it, South Dacanada.

179
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,440
You probably don't
think about

180
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,480
North Dakota very much,
and believe me, they know that.

181
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,480
In fact, one of their visitor centers
even assumes that they are going to be

182
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,160
the last state you'll visit.

183
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,480
North Dakota is probably

184
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,800
best known for the 1996
Coen brothers' movie, "Fargo,"

185
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,960
and the visitors center can
tell you all about it,

186
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,160
with pictures and the film's famous
wood chipper on display.

187
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,280
Visitors who save
the state for their 50th

188
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,840
get a "Best for Last" T-shirt
and a certificate.

189
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,200
Okay, okay.
Just a couple of things there.

190
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,120
First, you do know what that wood
chipper was used for, right ?

191
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,200
That was used
to grind up Steve Buscemi.

192
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,680
And secondly, "Best for Last"
is a heart-breaking slogan.

193
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,680
You're just one step away
from having it be

194
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,560
"North Dakota. Look: We know."

195
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,520
But the fact North Dakota is so upbeat

196
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,280
about its own lack of popularity is
quintessentially Midwestern.

197
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,000
People from North Dakota
are so kind and so wholesome,

198
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,400
a few years back,
they actually had billboards

199
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,240
by the roadsides reading
"Be kind" and "Be Polite,"

200
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,200
and that says something
wonderful about them,

201
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,280
just as it says
something awful about me

202
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,720
as a citizen of New York City

203
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,920
that my first reaction
to seeing a billboard

204
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,200
reading "Be Polite" is fuck you !

205
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,040
Don't tell me what to do !
Go fuck yourself !

206
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,200
Be polite. Be polite.

207
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,720
Fuck you !
Be polite.

208
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,040
The point is, North Dakota had
gotten used to being ignored,

209
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,560
but a few years ago, this happened.

210
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,040
North Dakota with the big
shale oil boom...

211
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,960
North Dakota's oil production climbed
to 810,000 barrels a day.

212
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,520
This is the California Gold Rush,

213
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,760
but in North Dakota,
in the 21st century.

214
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,560
Yes. Like Channing Tatum,
North Dakota suddenly

215
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,200
turned out to be
a lot more interesting

216
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,600
once it was covered in oil.

217
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,040
So over the last decade, the state's
Bakken Shale formation

218
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,800
has produced an oil boom so large,

219
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,880
it has helped cut the amount
of oil we import in half.

220
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Now, think about that.
North Dakota has done

221
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,800
almost as much to reduce
our dependence on foreign oil

222
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,200
as you did when you biked
to work that one time.

223
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,280
And at its peak,
this oil boom produced

224
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,160
thousands of jobs and millions of
dollars in wealth.

225
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,920
It was such a dramatic shift,
ABC has a new drama

226
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,320
set in the Bakken.

227
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,720
In the world of oil,
one name reigns supreme.

228
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,760
Here, you're either
with Briggs or you're out.

229
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,440
You think I'm just gonna toss
you the keys to the kingdom

230
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,040
and watch you drive it
over the cliffs ?

231
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,720
Sometimes you have to play dirty
to get filthy rich.

232
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,320
Blood and Oil.
Sundays, this fall.

233
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,600
Yes. On Sunday.

234
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,560
In the ultimate miracle,

235
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,200
the oil boom brought Don Johnson back.

236
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,760
And a Don Johnson television show
is as rare as a solar eclipse.

237
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,240
And like a solar eclipse, you really
shouldn't look directly at it.

238
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,680
But Don Johnson
is not the only reason

239
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,480
that this show is a little out-dated.

240
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,200
The price of oil has dropped
in the last year,

241
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,600
and companies have slowed down
expansion of new wells.

242
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,200
But when the price rises again,
the boom is expected to return.

243
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,080
So, maybe let's use this pause
to take stock of what the hell

244
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,560
just happened to North Dakota,
because for all the good

245
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,200
the oil industry has done
for the state,

246
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,200
it has not been without cost.

247
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,160
For a start, it's taken a massive toll
on their environment.

248
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,160
Last, year, "The New York Times"
found that since 2006,

249
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,600
18 million gallons
of oils and chemicals

250
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,120
had spilled, leaked,
or misted into the air.

251
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,880
That is a quantity
of lubricants and toxins

252
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,000
seldom found outside
of a John Mayer pool party,

253
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,640
and equally difficult to clean.

254
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,680
And that's saying something.

255
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,320
And spills of oil in saltwater can
have disastrous consequences.

256
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,240
Just listen to a couple of farmers

257
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,240
who have had their land
impacted by this.

258
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,680
When things go bad
and when saltwater happens,

259
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,440
you can't see it initially.

260
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,400
So, years down the road,
it shows up and it's devastating.

261
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,920
Something should have been a lot,
done a lot quicker.

262
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,840
Darwin Peterson farms
the land around here

263
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,200
and says this land now
is out of production

264
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,400
as long as he can foresee.

265
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,280
It pretty well,
you know, just annihilated.

266
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,280
Look, there are times when it's
acceptable to destroy farmland,

267
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,560
like when you're a child from Krypton
looking for a place to crashland,

268
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,760
or you're a bunch of racist baseball
ghosts looking for a place to play.

269
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,280
But this is not one of those times.

270
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,000
But the danger to land
is only just the beginning,

271
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,920
as a reporter for "Reveal" found
when she investigated

272
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,320
worker deaths
in the entire Bakken region.

273
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:38,720
Since 2006, at least 74 workers
have died in the Bakken oil fields.

274
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,120
That means that on average,
someone dies every six weeks

275
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,600
in the Bakken oil fields.

276
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,760
A death every six weeks is what you do

277
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,640
to keep your soap opera on the air.

278
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,320
In real life,
that is fucking horrifying.

279
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,240
Now, you might hope
employers would do everything

280
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,200
in their power
to minimize those risks,

281
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,400
but that does not always
seem to be the case.

282
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,080
Just listen to this one worker
whose job involves lowering

283
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,600
explosives into the earth
and detonating them

284
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,960
describe his schedule.

285
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,440
I work a 20 and ten.

286
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,200
20 days on, 10 days off.

287
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,560
The longest I've ever
been out on a job site

288
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,000
is 69 hours straight.

289
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,840
69 hours straight.

290
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,200
So that sounds like
it could be dangerous.

291
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,040
Yeah, definitely.
It's a ticking time bomb, really.

292
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,800
He worked 69 hours straight
handling explosives.

293
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,160
You shouldn't be allowed to work that
long handling frozen yogurt.

294
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,360
That is not what I ordered, Ricky !

295
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,200
That's a handful of sprinkles
with your watch in it !

296
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:45,200
Go home and rest !
I want to speak to a manager !

297
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,000
But the problem is
there are few incentives

298
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,920
for companies
to actively care about this.

299
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,160
We do have federal
regulators like OSHA,

300
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,880
but unfortunately, not only
have they themselves conceded

301
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,960
that their general regulations used
for oil and gas are inadequate,

302
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,040
but the odds of them ever turning up

303
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,080
to inspect a work site in North Dakota
are pretty slim.

304
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,600
OSHA only has nine full-time
compliance officers for North Dakota,

305
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,400
and according to some estimates,

306
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,920
it would take decades
for OSHA to inspect

307
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,240
every workplace in the state.

308
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,160
Only nine compliance officers.
That is terrible.

309
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,000
And it's actually even worse

310
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,200
because that clip is out of date
and they currently only have eight.

311
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,720
And incidentally,
those eight have to cover

312
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,160
both North and South Dakota.

313
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,080
And look, there are plenty of things

314
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,880
that having eight of
would be fine in the Dakotas.

315
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,600
Water parks ? Sure, eight is plenty.

316
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,200
Restaurants that serve lutefisk ?

317
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,840
Eight is seven more than enough.

318
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,200
But when you're talking about safety
inspectors for oil wells,

319
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,000
you're gonna at least
want to be in double digits.

320
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,200
And given all of this,
perhaps it shouldn't be

321
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,080
surprising when tragedy strikes,

322
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,200
as it did four years ago
at a well owned by a company

323
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,240
called Oasis Petroleum.

324
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,760
Some tragic news
from Western North Dakota.

325
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,280
One man is killed
and three are injured

326
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,640
in an oil well explosion.

327
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,200
A Wisconsin man died at the scene.

328
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,960
Three other men were transported
to the Williston Hospital

329
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,880
to be treated for severe burns.

330
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,360
Now, that is the sort
of local news story

331
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,480
that you watch,
feel briefly sad about,

332
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,920
and then forget as soon as they get
to their final story

333
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,200
about a squirrel
who can play ping-pong.

334
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,200
But remember,
that was a fatal accident,

335
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,120
and one of the workers who died was a
21-year-old named Brendan Wegner.

336
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,720
And for those who
worked alongside him,

337
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,640
their lives were never the same.

338
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,200
Jebadiah Stanfill was working
on a nearby rig and rushed over.

339
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,360
And I go out there and...

340
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,240
ask him where everybody's at
and how many are there and...

341
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,560
he just says, "Derrick man's dead.
The derrick man's dead."

342
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,760
That's when I looked up and...

343
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,880
I saw what I would later find out is
Brendan burning in the derrick.

344
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,800
One other worker died,

345
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,880
another lost his legs
and later committed suicide.

346
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,640
It was the deadliest accident in the
Bakken in the last decade.

347
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,640
Now, I know you're sad at this point,

348
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,480
but brace yourselves because
you are about to get angry.

349
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,520
Because after the accident,
OSHA visited the work site

350
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,200
and found that it was missing several
important safety features,

351
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,920
including flame-retardant
clothing and a safety slide.

352
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,720
Now, you might think
as owners of that well,

353
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,680
Oasis would come under
a lot of scrutiny from OSHA,

354
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,720
but you would be wrong about that.

355
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,040
How come Oasis wasn't held accountable
for this accident ?

356
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,360
Oasis doesn't have exposed employees
on the jobsite.

357
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,200
Rather, they hired a subcontractor.

358
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,640
Now it might sound
like a bunch of legalese,

359
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,840
but it's very important.

360
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,360
It doesn't sound
like a bunch of legalese.

361
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,800
It sounds like a bunch
of complete bullshit.

362
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,200
But it's actually true.

363
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,720
Oasis technically had
no employees there that day,

364
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,120
and let me explain how that happened.

365
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,880
Rather than hiring employees,

366
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,200
companies like Oasis
hire subcontractors.

367
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,080
In this case, a company
called Carlson Well Service,

368
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,560
who employ the workers instead.

369
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,200
And if you're thinking, "Well, surely
Oasis must have had

370
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,840
someone there
to supervise the work site,"

371
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,200
yes, they did, but he wasn't
an Oasis employee either.

372
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,120
He was an independent contractor,

373
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,400
a so-called "company man"
working for another firm,

374
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,800
hired by Oasis called
Mitchell's Oil Field Service.

375
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,200
So because Oasis had
their "company man"

376
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,000
who didn't work for the company

377
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,080
overseeing the work site,
and their subcontractor

378
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,520
overseeing its own workers,
that meant that technically,

379
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,120
no one working on Oasis's well

380
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,600
worked for Oasis that day,
and that is a magic trick so shitty,

381
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,600
it's amazing Criss Angel
didn't come out and shout,

382
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,760
"Mindfreak !" at the end of it.

383
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,760
Mindfreak !
I've gotcha, everyone !

384
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,600
I mind-fracked ya !

385
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,920
And to be clear, Oasis was not found
at fault for this accident.

386
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,200
How could they be ?

387
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,400
In their deal with Carlson,
they made sure to say that

388
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,360
Carlson had the authority
to control and direct

389
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,040
the performance and safety
of the work and then

390
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,080
wrote "Company is interested only in
the results obtained."

391
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,960
And look, bad things tend to happen

392
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,200
when you're interested
only in the results obtained.

393
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,080
That is a policy
that leads to a woman trying

394
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,200
to lose 15 pounds
for her wedding day saying,

395
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,360
"Fuck it ! The juice cleanse
isn't working !

396
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,120
"Get me some heroin !
"I'm fitting in that Vera Wang !

397
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,480
I don't care anymore !"

398
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,960
Now, I should point out,
Oasis wanted us to say

399
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,880
they did absolutely nothing wrong,

400
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,440
and also that they have
added new safety measures

401
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,360
since the accident, essentially saying

402
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,000
their system was always fine, and
that's why they have now fixed it.

403
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,120
And, look, subcontracting
and workplace accidents

404
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,360
are not unique to North Dakota.

405
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,320
What is unique to North Dakota

406
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,520
is the level of regulatory
friendliness to oil companies,

407
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,600
something that their immensely
charismatic governor

408
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,520
likes to describe like this.

409
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,200
We have created a friendly business
climate in North Dakota,

410
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,400
where taxes and insurance
rates are low.

411
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,040
The regulatory environment
is very reasonable.

412
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,880
North Dakotans are
friendly toward business

413
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,880
and will work hard to help
their employers be successful.

414
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,800
He's making North Dakota sound like a
magical, pro-business utopia,

415
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,760
like Willy Wonka's chocolate factory,

416
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,960
which, come to think of it,
had about the same

417
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,800
safety record as
North Dakota's oil fields.

418
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,160
Now we'll think back.

419
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,200
It was about the same body count.

420
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,440
And he is not kidding.

421
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,560
The thing is,
the governor is not kidding

422
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,040
about the friendly business climate,

423
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,880
because Governor Dalrymple
himself heads up

424
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,640
the three-person industrial commission

425
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,960
that oversees the majority of spills.

426
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,120
And to give you a sense
of the type of oversight

427
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,240
they provide, last year,
"The New York Times" found

428
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,000
that one of the biggest
oil producers in the area,

429
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,360
Continental Resources,
which had spilled

430
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,840
1.6 million gallons since 2006,

431
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,640
had been fined only $222,000,

432
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,680
which would be bad enough
if those fines had not

433
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,840
then been reduced down
to just $20,000 because

434
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,200
and this is amazing

435
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,640
the commission typically
settles for about ten percent

436
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,200
of the assessed penalties.

437
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,760
Oil companies in North Dakota
pay for their mistakes

438
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,760
the same way that four-year-olds pay
for their toys,

439
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,920
very rarely, and when they do,
it's mostly just a symbolic gesture.

440
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,600
Just give the man
the dollar, Jason.

441
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,640
Give him the dollar.
I know it really costs $10.

442
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,200
I just want him to feel
like he's doing something.

443
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,200
Now, another member
of that commission,

444
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,680
Lynn Helms, claims this system
actually works well

445
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,720
due to the conditions
that they attach.

446
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,560
They agree to cut a check
for that amount, unappealable,

447
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,800
if a repeat violation occurs during
that one-to-five-year time period.

448
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,480
It's like probation, and it really
changes behavior.

449
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,800
Helms says looking back
on five years of data,

450
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,520
no companies have
had a repeat violation.

451
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,760
Really ?

452
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,640
No companies have
had a repeat violation ?

453
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,200
That is one hell of a claim.
Let's take a look at that, shall we ?

454
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,400
Because their deals typically
stipulate that the company must have

455
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,480
"no same or substantially similar
violations within a year."

456
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,520
So, let's look at Petro-Hunt.

457
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,640
The got a 90% discount
on a $25,000 fine last year

458
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,600
after an incident
in which they spilled

459
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,600
over 3,000 gallons of oil.

460
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,200
And yet, five months later,
and this is true,

461
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,520
which is less than a year,
this happened.

462
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,920
The state health department
has responded to an oil spill

463
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,160
near the town of Keene
in McKenzie County.

464
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,200
Petro-Hunt says about 600 barrels
of oil leaked from a well

465
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,400
and it was not contained on site.

466
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,040
600 barrels of oil.

467
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,400
That is over 25,000 gallons.

468
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,560
How is that not
substantially similar ?

469
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,640
It's basically the exact
same thing, only worse.

470
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,920
It's the "Hangover II" of oil spills !
It's wrong !

471
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,640
And North Dakota's
"friendly regulations"

472
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,200
even extend to campaign finance.

473
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,080
The oil industry is actually
the top political contributor

474
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,120
in the state,
which isn't that surprising.

475
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,200
What is surprising is that,
as one state legislator

476
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,080
pointed out, in North Dakota,

477
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,200
you don't even have
to spend campaign funds

478
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,520
on your campaigns.

479
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,200
When I first ran,
visiting with candidates,

480
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,240
I always asked,
"If you had any money left

481
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,360
in the campaign account at the end,
what do you do with it ?"

482
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,440
One of the most fascinating
answers I received was,

483
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,200
"Well, you put it in your checking
account. It's yours.

484
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,360
That's income."

485
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,840
Now, I know... I know his flannel bow
tie is extremely distracting,

486
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,240
but what he's saying is horrifying.

487
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,240
In North Dakota, you could
theoretically find yourself saying,

488
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,120
"Well, I gave my state rep money
for TV ads and yard signs,"

489
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,200
"but instead, he blew it all
on a full-length mink coat"

490
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,960
"and the glasses Buddy Holly
was wearing when he died."

491
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,600
That's not what it was for.

492
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,040
You look good, but it's
not what it was for.

493
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,200
But you do look good.

494
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,200
And I am not saying legislators in
North Dakota do that,

495
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,800
but that's a system you might want

496
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,640
a state ethics commission
to look into,

497
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,200
except for the fact that and this
really should not surprise you,

498
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,640
North Dakota does not have
an ethics commission,

499
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,200
which is pretty much guaranteeing that
FIFA just found the location

500
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,320
for its new
international headquarters.

501
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,680
They're coming, North Dakota !

502
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,200
They're coming !

503
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,920
And finally, North Dakota also allows

504
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,600
the oil industry to use
something called

505
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,400
indemnification to
avoid civil liability.

506
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,280
And to show you how that works,

507
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,160
let's go back to Oasis Petroleum

508
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,160
and that deadly explosion
we mentioned earlier.

509
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,360
As you know, Oasis didn't have to pay
any fine for that accident.

510
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,880
However, they did wind up agreeing

511
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,760
to pay Brendan Wegner's family
an undisclosed settlement.

512
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,400
Except not entirely,
because they also had

513
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,840
an indemnification clause
in their contract with Carlson

514
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,040
stating that in cases
like the accident

515
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,120
that killed Brendan, Carlson would
hold Oasis harmless against all claims

516
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,200
without limit and without regard
to the cause or the negligence

517
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,520
or fault of any party.

518
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,720
So theoretically, even if
Oasis were negligent,

519
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,720
and found completely at fault,
Carlson's insurance company

520
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,520
could find itself paying
a chunk of Oasis's settlement,

521
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,400
which in this case, it did.

522
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,920
And sure, technically
the family gets paid

523
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,040
either way, but who pays matters.

524
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,880
Payments are deterrents,
and think of it like this.

525
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,840
If every time you parked
in front of a fire hydrant,

526
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,280
someone else got a ticket,
you'd probably be a lot

527
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,200
less inclined to drive
around the block looking

528
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,320
for open parking spaces.

529
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,200
And I understand that
North Dakota wants

530
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,480
to be business friendly
and that plenty of businesses

531
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,480
use indemnification clauses,
but the danger involved

532
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,000
in the oil industry
makes it a little different,

533
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,280
which is why some
of the states ban or limit

534
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,760
indemnification clauses
in the oil industry.

535
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,720
Even Texas limits them. Texas !

536
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,200
Texas !

537
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,880
And Texas is so loosely regulated,
their speed limit is "let 'er rip,"

538
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,560
and their age of consent
is just a drawing of a wink.

539
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,800
Listen, listen. Please.

540
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,200
North Dakota, please listen.

541
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,720
I get it.
You're friendly, and that's fantastic.

542
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,120
You had billboards saying "Be Polite"

543
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,200
and that's wonderful,
but this has gone too far.

544
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,520
Oil companies need to be held
accountable when bad things happen.

545
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,880
A fine is no good
if it's a drop in the bucket,

546
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,200
especially because knowing
these companies now,

547
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,600
they'll probably miss that bucket
and then somehow find a way to make

548
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,840
someone else pay to clean up
the fucking mess.

549
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,880
So please, I would like to suggest to
you a new approach.

550
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,960
Hey, North Dakota,

551
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,720
we know you're a friendly place,

552
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,600
full of nice people doing nice things.

553
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,120
You like to shake hands,
smile, and for some reason,

554
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,200
build a giant turtle out of wheel rims
by the highway.

555
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,200
That's a fucking awesome
turtle, North Dakota !

556
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,320
Nice job !

557
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,640
But lately, we've become concerned

558
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,080
that oil companies have been
taking advantage of you.

559
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,320
And sure, they brought
lots of jobs and money

560
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,320
to your state, and that's nice,

561
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,440
but jobs and money
shouldn't come at the expense

562
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,200
of your land or your life.

563
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,880
Right now in some ways, you're less
regulated than Texas !

564
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,480
Fucking Texas !

565
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,280
You're less regulated
than whatever this is !

566
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,160
So listen, just for once, it might be
time to stop being polite...

567
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,040
and start getting mad.

568
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,880
Even madder, North Dakota.
No ! Much madder than that !

569
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,040
Holy shit !
Not you, possum.

570
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,280
But the rest of you...
Yes, that's better ! Get pissed !

571
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,640
Remember, people are dying
and land is getting ruined,

572
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,560
so come on, North Dakota !

573
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,920
Let the ferocious animals
lurking beneath

574
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
your frozen exteriors out
for once in your goddamn lives !

575
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,080
Do it !

576
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,080
And we're asking you in the most North
Dakotan way we know how

577
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,560
with an actual billboard
on one of your actual highways

578
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,200
saying "Be Angry,"

579
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,800
followed, of course,
by the word "Please."

580
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,200
So please be angry, North Dakota.

581
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,800
Be angry. Please !

582
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,960
That is up there.

583
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,520
That's our show.
Thank you so much for watching.

584
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,960
See you next week. Good night !

585
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,200
