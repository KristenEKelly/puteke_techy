00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,440
LAST WEEK TONIGHT WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,280
Welcome, welcome, welcome,
to Last Week Tonight.

3
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,240
Thank you so much for joining us.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,240
Just time for a quick recap
of the week.

5
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,200
And we begin with Iran.

6
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,960
Not just the setting for 2013
best picture winner Argo.

7
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,320
Also a country.

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,320
Now as of this morning

9
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,520
it seems Iran may be tantalizingly
close to a historic nuclear deal.

10
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,680
This could be a country
on the brink of a change.

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,640
A high-ranking Iranian official
telling us just a short time ago,

12
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,440
she is quite optimistic that a deal
will come in the next 24 hours.

13
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, let's hope that is true.

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,800
Because these discussions
have been going for a year and a half.

15
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,760
They're almost tantric negotiations,

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,760
except in this case
we're all really hoping

17
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,200
that there is not a massive explosion
at the end of it.

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,320
If this deal is successful,

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,840
we will have come a long way
from earlier this week,

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,800
when it seemed tensions
between John Kerry

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,920
and Iran negotiator
Mohammad Javad Zarif

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,000
might sink the whole thing.

23
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,280
Kerry and Zarif were yelling
at each other so loudly,

24
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,920
that they could be heard
outside of the room.

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,440
Now, that sounds bad,
yes, that sounds bad.

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,000
Although it is actually preferable

27
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,320
to hearing the sound
of the two of them making up.

28
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,760
Just low moans
and the sound of what I hope

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,320
is someone scooping out
a cantaloupe.

30
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,840
The thing is it wasn't just Kerry,
the EU's Federica Mogherini

31
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,920
supposedly also got involved
in a heated dispute with Zarif,

32
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,000
resulting in him shouting:
"never threaten an Iranian."

33
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,240
Although she had
a very good explanation.

34
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,600
You wouldn't expect an Iranian and
an Italian negotiating in a cold way,

35
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,200
that is I would say,
part of our culture.

36
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,720
Of course it is.

37
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,360
We all know the three most famous
stereotypes of Italian culture

38
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,720
are that they have close family
relationships,

39
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,560
they turn international negotiations
into shouting matches,

40
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,920
and they enjoy cooking pasta for dogs.
You know. Italians.

41
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,520
So let's move on,
let's move to Greece.

42
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,960
The most recent Greek tragedy,

43
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,880
and also the subject
of the other major negotiation

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,880
taking place in Europe this week.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,080
Greece desperately
needs another bailout,

46
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,560
and it they can't reach
a deal with the Euro zone,

47
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,360
they may be forced
to abandon the Euro altogether.

48
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,120
Or to put it another way.

49
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,880
The so-called Grexit,
a Greek exit from the Euro zone.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,280
To Grexit or not to Grexit.

51
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,320
I love saying the word Grexit though.
That just drives me crazy.

52
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah, Greece might Grexit.

53
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,080
Which is a pretty glib way to describe
something potentially catastrophic

54
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,280
that could devastate millions of lives.

55
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,000
A cutesy name doesn't make
a crisis less awful.

56
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,120
When a doctor tells you
you have anal warts,

57
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,320
it doesn't help if he
describes them as "booty bumps".

58
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,240
The main obstacle to a deal
seems to be trust at this point.

59
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,800
And the tone of some of the EU leaders
has frankly not helped.

60
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,840
Watch the former Belgian leader
address the Greek prime minister

61
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,680
just earlier this week.

62
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,160
You are talking about reforms,

63
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,240
but we never see
concrete proposals of reforms.

64
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,800
You have to downsize the public sector.

65
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,400
I know, it's difficult maybe
for a leftist, but it has to be done.

66
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,680
That might be the most insulting thing

67
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,160
I've ever seen an outsider
do to the Greek people.

68
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,280
And I am including this
scene from "Mamma Mia".

69
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,160
Please, someone call the UN.

70
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,160
We have a musical genocide
on our hands.

71
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,480
And look, neither side
is blameless in this dispute.

72
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,000
Greece is in this mess

73
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,160
because it spent money like a rapper
whose accountant is Nicholas Cage.

74
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,880
And as for the EU, their so-called fix
helped melt down the Greek economy.

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,800
They're like a doctor
trying to cure a patient

76
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,880
through a steady regime
of Jager shots and yelling.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,760
So as of right now it is unclear
whether a deal is likely.

78
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,040
But if it happens, Greece can take
some consolation from the fact

79
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,880
that their new finance minister,
Euclid Tsakalotos,

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,880
would presumably
be signing the agreement.

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,800
And in perhaps the only
act of rebellion left open to them,

82
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,640
this is his actual signature.

83
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,480
And I'm pretty sure
that's the only reason he got the job.

84
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,920
"Look, it's pretty clear we're not
gonna get anything we want"

85
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,400
"from these negotiations."

86
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,560
"Whose signature
most looks the most like a dick ?"

87
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,120
And finally tonight...

88
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,920
the Confederate battle flag.

89
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,120
Also known as the Lynyrd Skynyrd
comforter.

90
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,440
On Friday, South Carolina
got everyone's attention.

91
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,440
We begin with the breaking news.
For the first time in 54 years,

92
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,960
the Confederate battle flag no longer
flies on the statehouse grounds

93
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,520
in the state of South Carolina.

94
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,280
SOUTH CAROLINA'S
CONFEDERATE FLAG NOW IN A MUSEUM

95
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,480
SOUTH CAROLONA TAKES DOWN
THE CONFEDERATE FLAG

96
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,960
That's great ! Although, yes.
Yes, that objective is great.

97
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,560
Although maybe go a little easy
on the USA chants.

98
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,640
Because it's a good moment.

99
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,920
But I don't know
if it's a proud moment.

100
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,640
It should be the same feeling

101
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,520
as a 54-year old
finally losing his virginity.

102
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,080
"Yes, I did it !"

103
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,440
Although that probably should've
happened a lot sooner.

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,920
And also, before anyone
gets carried away,

105
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,840
there are still plenty
of racist symbols on display

106
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,480
in government-run institutions,
from the state flag of Mississippi,

107
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,320
to Vestavia Hills, Alabama,

108
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,960
where they're currently considering
changing one high school's mascot.

109
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,400
The Rebel Man logo is a caricature
of an old South plantation owner.

110
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,760
At Vestavia High sporting events,
a student dresses up as Rebel Man,

111
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,840
the Civil War soldier,
and fires up the crowd.

112
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,400
There's nothing racist about it.

113
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,240
A Confederate flag
with its direct ties to racism,

114
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,040
taking that down is drawing a line.

115
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,480
But when you're starting
to bicker over a caricature,

116
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,680
you're not drawing lines anymore,
you're splitting hairs.

117
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Okay, here's the problem with that,
and not to split hairs,

118
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,760
but your logo
is a plantation owner.

119
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,760
And saying that
the image of a plantation owner

120
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,720
is not used in a racist way

121
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,120
is a bit like arguing
the Hitachi magic wand

122
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,760
is only used as a back massager.

123
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,800
Oh, sure, maybe you only
use it that way.

124
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,920
But al lot of other people
use it very differently.

125
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,320
Listen, I'm gonna... I want to try to
give them the benefit of the doubt here

126
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,840
and assume that the only thing holding
them back from replacing their mascot

127
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,880
is the need for a new costume.

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,080
And that would make sense.
Costumes are expensive.

129
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,840
But here's where
we may be able to help you.

130
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,720
We've made a lot of mascots
on this show.

131
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,280
You may remember,
we made a space sex gecko,

132
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,720
a polar bear with a broken penis,

133
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,600
an illuminati pyramid.

134
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,360
And any number
of other ridiculous costumes.

135
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,280
They're really good costumes.

136
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,720
And tragically, most of them
are in storage right now.

137
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,880
Our office looks like a wealthy furry's
basement, and you need to help us.

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,760
So listen, Vestavia Hills,

139
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,400
if you get rid of your objectively
racist logo and mascot,

140
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,800
you can have any of these you want.

141
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,240
In fact, this offer is open

142
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,960
to all high schools with pointless
offensive mascots or team names.

143
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm talking to you, the Freeburg
Community High School Midget.

144
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,720
What the fuck were you
thinking with that ?

145
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
And for the record,

146
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,920
this offer is also absolutely open to
the Washington Redskins, as well.

147
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,520
Get in touch, but do it quick !

148
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,080
Supplies are limited, and act fast.

149
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,760
You do not want to get stuck with
creepy baby with hulk hands in a tutu.

150
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,200
And now, this.

151
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,280
And now...

152
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,960
Whoopi Goldberg defends
ten surprising things.

153
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,440
Bill Cosby.

154
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,720
He's not been proven a rapist.

155
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,560
Roman Polanski.

156
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,360
I don't believe it was a rape, rape.

157
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,800
Ray Rice

158
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,080
If you hit somebody, you cannot be sure
you are not going to get hit back.

159
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,360
Chris Brown

160
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,480
Nobody knows what happened,
so all you haters out there,

161
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,000
just find something else to hate
till you get all the facts.

162
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
Torture

163
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,880
There are other countries
that have done

164
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,680
it and it's reaped
quite good benefits for them.

165
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,440
Jesse James cheating on
Sandra Bullock.

166
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,080
This is really wrong to say...

167
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,520
No, it's not, it's nobody's fault.

168
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,320
Her decision to appear in the 2014
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" film.

169
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,680
- They love pizza. I love pizza.
- Me too.

170
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,080
Moon landing conspiracy theories.

171
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,560
There are a couple questions
that I do have from time to time.

172
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,240
Who shot the footage ?

173
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,520
Mel Gibson.

174
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,640
I know Mel
and I know he's not a racist.

175
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,160
- Really ?
- Yeah, I do.

176
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,200
And finally, her own career goals.

177
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,160
I want to become
an ambassador to a country.

178
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,200
And... yeah, you wouldn't mind me
being an ambassador, would you ?

179
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,360
And now...

180
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,360
Moving on...

181
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,680
Our main story tonight
concerns sports.

182
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,920
The thing you weren't quite good
enough at for your dad to love you.

183
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,360
I absolutely love sports.

184
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,160
In fact the only times
I've cried as a grown man

185
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,120
have been while watching
actors playing coaches

186
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,680
deliver inspirational speeches
set to stirring music.

187
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,600
This game is not over.

188
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,360
This battle is not over.

189
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,480
Listen up ! This is our time now.
Second half is our time.

190
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,680
Because we know
when we add up all those inches

191
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,240
that's gonna make the fucking
difference between winning and losing.

192
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,400
Clear eyes, full hearts.

193
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,160
Hey let's go play some football !
Let's go, baby !

194
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,760
Yes !

195
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll do anything that man says.

196
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,840
We are all lucky that Kyle Chandler
is not a Scientologist

197
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,800
or I would be broke and married
to Mimi Rogers right now.

198
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,320
That's a fact. That's a true fact.

199
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,320
But look, tonight we're not gonna talk
about the players on the field,

200
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,360
we're gonna talk about
the fields themselves.

201
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,120
Stadiums. America has a lot of them

202
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,600
and they are increasingly fantastic.

203
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,760
At the home of the Dallas Cowboys
here's what you also get:

204
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,520
real art
by world-renowned artists.

205
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,240
The party suite is all about
watching the game or concert in style.

206
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,240
You can do bottle service, you can
set up come in before the game.

207
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,360
You know, you get the snakeskin,
they add the gold "H"

208
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,160
so everybody knows
where you're sitting.

209
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,480
There are 14 party cabanas and
two pools watched by lifeguards

210
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,760
that looked out on the field.
Just look toward the end zone.

211
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,920
Yep, those swimming pools
are inside the stadium.

212
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,280
That's right. You can now watch
a game from a swimming pool

213
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,840
suspended above the field,
where the real contest for the fans

214
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,760
is finding out whether or not
HPV can swim.

215
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,800
Hey, my money's on HPV.
That's a clutch, STD. That's clutch.

216
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,360
Most new stadiums nowadays

217
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,920
look like they were designed
by a coked-up Willy Wonka.

218
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,600
And if you don't believe me,

219
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,440
just look at what the Miami Marlins
have in their new ballpark.

220
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,520
That's a fish tank around the
whole park. That is awesome.

221
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,240
Yes. The Marlins have actual
aquariums behind home plate.

222
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,080
Which is indeed awesome,
because you get to watch baseball

223
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,880
while at the same time watching fish
develop panic disorders.

224
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,240
And look: all those new features
are clearly incredible.

225
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,720
The problem is they're also expensive.

226
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,080
And the vast majority of stadiums
are built using public money.

227
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,360
One analysis
found that between 2000 and 2010

228
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,680
we spent 12 billion dollars
building new facilities

229
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,400
for professional teams.
Which begs the question: why ?

230
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,800
Sports teams are successful
businesses with wealthy owners

231
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,440
and yet they still get our help.

232
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,840
Two years ago, Detroit got approval

233
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,360
to spend more than $ 280 million
in taxpayer money

234
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,680
on a new arena project
for the Red Wings,

235
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,400
just six days after the city
filed for bankruptcy,

236
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,280
even though the Red Wings owner
is Mike Ilitch,

237
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,520
the founder of the
Little Caesars Pizza chain

238
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,120
who's worth an estimated $ 5,1 billion.
That's a little hard to swallow.

239
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,320
I mean sure not as hard to swallow

240
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,880
as a little Caesars crazy bread
with an assortment of "Caesar dips",

241
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,520
but still pretty hard.

242
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,720
And we don't just help teams
build stadiums,

243
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,640
we let them keep virtually all the
revenue those stadiums then produce.

244
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,040
Just listen to the president
of the Miami Marlins

245
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,440
describe their
not at all unusual deal.

246
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,480
You get the income
from naming rights ?

247
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Yes.

248
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,200
- You get the income from concessions ?
- Yes.

249
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,720
- You get the luxury box income ?
- Yes.

250
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,080
You get the income
from non-baseball events ?

251
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,360
That's the whole object of this,
is to get more revenue.

252
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,440
That's... that's pretty direct.

253
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,480
Hey, you think I've got into this
'cause I like sports ?

254
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,320
What are you, a child ? Who let
a child host a television show ?

255
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,920
This is all about the money, son.
The money !

256
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,240
He mentioned naming rights
in there and it is true.

257
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,120
For most teams,
if you sell the name of your building,

258
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,240
you get to keep the money.
Even when it's a stupid is this.

259
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,840
The New Orleans Pelicans are
going to be playing their home games

260
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,400
at the Smoothie King Center.

261
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,760
Yeah, the Smoothie King Center.

262
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,360
And you have to feel
a bit for the Pelican players.

263
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,720
It can't be easy
to protect your home court

264
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,520
when it's named after a slop of yogurt
and kale ejaculated from a blender.

265
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,880
But owners monetizing every part
of a stadium is so ingrained,

266
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,760
it's even now a feature
in the Madden NFL video game.

267
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,200
We're adding the ability to run
your team as an NFL owner.

268
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,680
Being an owner isn't just about talking
though, it's about taking action.

269
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,680
Set prices on concessions
merchandising tickets.

270
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,200
Upgrade your stadium,

271
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,200
improve everything, from
the parking lot to the locker room.

272
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,200
It's incredible. The owner experience
is apparently so realistic

273
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,000
that if you unlock a secret level

274
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,960
you can even deal with the aftermath
of making a racist comment.

275
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,800
That's... incredible attention
to detail for gamers.

276
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,440
Teams are so successful
at pushing for upgraded stadiums

277
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,280
that since the early 90s we've had
a replacement rate of over 90 %.

278
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,800
We replace stadiums even faster
than we replace Spidermen.

279
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,840
And come on !
Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield

280
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,080
were perfectly good
state of the art Spidermen.

281
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,600
Almost every single team
gets some kind of public money.

282
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,080
Some, like the Yankees,
might build the stadium themselves

283
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,160
but on land that they're given
rent and property tax free,

284
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,080
costing New York City
hundreds of millions in lost revenues.

285
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,360
But many others
get their stadiums funded

286
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,840
through tax-exempt
municipal bonds,

287
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,680
which, yes, sound like
the last words an accountant says

288
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,080
before his blind date falls asleep
at the dinner table.

289
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,080
But they're actually
incredibly important,

290
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,240
so let me quickly try to explain.

291
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,080
Municipal bonds are a way
for the city to take out a loan

292
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,720
which they then later repay
with interest,

293
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,760
although usually
through new or existing taxes.

294
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,560
They're supposed to be
for things like roads or schools,

295
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,920
public goods the private industry
would not pay for.

296
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,680
But they've been routinely
misused to finance stadiums for decades

297
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,080
and often cities do it
because teams claim

298
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,480
they can't afford to build
stadiums themselves.

299
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,720
The Marlins got nearly
500 million dollars

300
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,800
toward their fish traumatizing
theme park by pleading poverty

301
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,280
although when Miami-Dade County
tried to verify that,

302
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,200
something strange happened.

303
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,720
Among the questions they asked
was "can we see your books".

304
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,320
- You said no.
- Right.

305
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,320
Why didn't you just open the books ?
Why isn't that easier ?

306
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,000
Because in Major League Baseball
history, books are just kept private.

307
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,480
That's just how it is.

308
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,760
Sure. But if the argument

309
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,760
"in Major League Baseball history
that's just how it is" always won,

310
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,080
we'd still have an all-white league
of players gambling on games

311
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,640
smoking cigarette to the plate
and dying of syphilis.

312
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,640
But then leaked documents
later revealed

313
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,520
that despite denying
they made a profit

314
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,400
the Marlins had generated nearly $50
million over the previous two years.

315
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,280
And listen:
pretending you're poor is wrong.

316
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,000
It wasn't okay when Mary-Kate Olsen
went through her hobo phase.

317
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,240
And it's not okay now.

318
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,440
And we haven't even mentioned
the ultimate bargaining chip

319
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,200
that teams like to use:
threatening to leave.

320
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,160
Right now, the Oakland Raiders,
the St. Louis Rams

321
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,360
and the San Diego Chargers are all
threatening to move to Los Angeles

322
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,800
unless they get new stadiums.

323
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,920
In fact, over the past two decades

324
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,600
nearly half the NFL has been subject
to speculation about a move to L.A.

325
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,880
It's such a cliché,

326
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,960
that in the current Madden video game
if you want a new stadium,

327
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,000
a good way to do that
is to relocate the team.

328
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,280
And the game even tells you
the "easiest choice financially"

329
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,880
is guess where ? Los Angeles.

330
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,840
And if you're a Chargers fan
that must be pretty infuriating.

331
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,040
Oh, come on ! Even my make-believe
escapist entertainment

332
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,640
he's trying to move
my fucking team to L.A. !

333
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,320
In fact, Charges fans are currently
so terrified their team might leave,

334
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,920
not only are they campaigning to
spend public money on a stadium

335
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,960
they're doing it in one
of the worst rap songs of all time.

336
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,360
Die Hard fans
almost went on a rampage.

337
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,000
I tell no lies,
I hope you understand why.

338
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,320
Got the best of the best fans.
Other teams are hating on them.

339
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,200
They deserve a brand new stadium.

340
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,720
San Diego, the finest city.

341
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,200
San Diego, the second-largest city.

342
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,760
Save our Bolts, save our committee.

343
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,280
San Diego making money
so put it back in your city.

344
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,240
Wait, wait ! Go back !

345
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,040
Did he say "second largest city" ?

346
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,880
That is a strange boast
for a rap song.

347
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,760
"Yo I got the second hottest car
'cause I'm the second most paid,"

348
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,680
"when I go to the club
I get the second most laid !"

349
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,200
Second most. Second most.

350
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:28,440
"I'm out there. I'm number two, yo !
Number two !"

351
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:34,360
And teams are shameless
in manipulating city's fears.

352
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,280
In 1997, the Minnesota Twins
even ran an ad

353
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,680
showing a player visiting a child in
hospital with cancer and the tagline:

354
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,000
"If the twins leave Minnesota,
an eight year old from Willmar"

355
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,640
"undergoing chemotherapy will
never get a visit from Marty Cordova."

356
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,160
Which is less like
the Make-a-Wish Foundation

357
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,240
and more like
the make-a-threat foundation.

358
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,200
But teams don't just use threats
to get what they want.

359
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,160
They also promised that new stadiums
can work economic magic.

360
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,960
The Milwaukee Bucks, who are
also currently threatening to leave

361
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,360
if they don't get a new arena
are running this ad now.

362
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,800
The ripple effect starts here.

363
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,560
This is Wisconsin's home.

364
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,640
From the court to concerts,

365
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,640
transforming the community

366
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,360
with new development, jobs,
growth and opportunity.

367
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,080
The ripple effect of a new era
begins today.

368
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,160
It spreads across the riverfront,
up through Bronzeville

369
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,280
and across
the great state of Wisconsin.

370
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,200
Settle down, Milwaukee Bucks.

371
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,240
For a start, don't think Wisconsin will
be transformed by one new arena.

372
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,400
And also if you really are looking
to make a tangible change,

373
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,400
how about coming up with a better
slogan than "fear the deer".

374
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,560
Deers aren't scary.

375
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,000
They're timid forest ponies
with sticks on their heads.

376
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,560
I fear no deer.

377
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,080
The truth is stadiums very rarely
revitalize their surrounding areas

378
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,800
or create large numbers
of permanent jobs.

379
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,800
Just listen to one bar owner
near that new Marlins ballpark.

380
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,160
He says since
the stadium opened in 2012,

381
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,160
not only of his profits not risen,

382
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,000
on game days, his regulars
stay away afraid of the traffic.

383
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,320
Here as a business owner,
we don't see any changes.

384
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,360
You could even
say it's hurting us.

385
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,160
Of course it is.
Because no one has ever said:

386
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,000
"Hey, let's go hang out
in the area around the stadium !"

387
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,840
"And I'll tell you why,
I've got a new shirt"

388
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,720
"and I really want someone to vomit
Miller Light and nachos all over it !"

389
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,360
In fact, a major review
of almost 20 years of studies

390
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,360
showed economists could find
"no substantial evidence"

391
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,160
"that stadiums had increased jobs,
incomes or tax revenues."

392
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,000
Or to put that another way,

393
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,160
This one economist said to me,
I love this line, he said,

394
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,840
"Rather than spend
a billion dollars on a stadium"

395
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,880
"you're actually better off
flying a plane over a city"

396
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,280
"and dumping a billion dollars
on the populace"

397
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,640
"and just letting them pick
up the money and spend it."

398
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,520
Sure, look. Yeah.
That's not, to be fair...

399
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,160
That it's not a great idea
for the economy

400
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,880
but is a fantastic idea
for a new reality show.

401
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,560
"Tune in this Sunday for Ryan
Seacrest's billion dollar-dump."

402
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,120
"Only on NBC."

403
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,960
And it gets one step worse

404
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,640
because when you use public
money to pay for an expensive stadium,

405
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,120
you might find yourself unable
to afford something you badly need.

406
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,440
Hamilton County in Ohio was
estimated to spend 50 million last year

407
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,840
on debts and other costs
for the Bengals and the Reds stadiums

408
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,640
even though since building them
they've had to sell a public hospital,

409
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,000
cut 1,700 jobs and delay payments
for schools, because of budget gaps.

410
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,920
And it might not even end there,

411
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,240
because there's a clause
in the contract that states

412
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,800
if 14 other NFL
stadiums have something,

413
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,960
then taxpayers
must buy the Bengals that thing.

414
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,920
And here is how comprehensive
that clause is.

415
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,280
Taxpayers are also on the hook for
all kinds of future bells and whistles.

416
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,520
Some that haven't even been
invented yet.

417
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,600
At some point taxpayers
have also agreed to pay

418
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,360
for a holograph replay machine,
someday.

419
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,720
It's true, the Bengals have a deal

420
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,600
whereby if someone invents holographic
instant replay in the future

421
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,720
the county has to buy it for them.

422
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,080
And that's the kind of clause owners
put into a deal

423
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,840
in order to take it out
during negotiations.

424
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,680
Which begs the question
what else was in there ?

425
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,280
"Look, we want a helipad,
a submarine dock"

426
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,960
"and a monkey named Professor Bananas"

427
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,680
"to hang out in the locker room
during halftime"

428
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,920
"or we're moving the team to L.A."

429
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,240
But teams get these deals because
they know politicians will capitulate

430
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,680
and give them whatever they want.

431
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,360
Rremember Milwaukee ?
Well, just Monday, just this Monday,

432
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,960
their mayor argued for a new
stadium deal he admits is not perfect,

433
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,920
with this appeal to civic pride.

434
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,440
I was in China ten years ago.
I was on the Great Wall of China

435
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,120
and I had a Milwaukee t-shirt on,
and I'm on the Great Wall of China

436
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,720
this guy Chinese guy came up to me said
"Milwaukee Bucks".

437
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,600
That's important to me,
it's important to all of us.

438
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,840
Okay, okay...

439
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,600
The only possible way
that story is true

440
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,800
is if that Chinese man happened to be

441
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,800
former Milwaukee Bucks player
Yi Jianlian.

442
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,280
"Hey, remember me ?
Milwaukee Bucks."

443
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,520
"Two seasons ! I averaged 8,6 a game.
Milwaukee Bucks !"

444
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,440
And you can almost sympathize,

445
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,440
because when politicians do try to
stand up to teams, it can cost them.

446
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,160
Last month the city council
of Glendale Arizona

447
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,480
voted to try and get out
of an awful deal with the Coyotes

448
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,280
whose hockey arena was costing
them more than $8 million per year.

449
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,760
The mayor held a public hearing,
and it did not go well.

450
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,200
I support this team.

451
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,480
It's you that doesn't support
any sport in this city

452
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,400
not football and certainly not hockey.

453
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:55,120
What you're doing is childish, it's
pathetic and it's just disrespectful.

454
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,720
While I can see her passion is real,

455
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,680
you don't get to call someone childish
when you are the one arguing

456
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,240
for spending millions of public
dollars you don't have

457
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,960
to keep a giant slab of ice in Arizona.

458
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,240
Just days after that,
Coyotes fans raised money,

459
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,200
so that she could tase
the mayor for charity.

460
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,200
Taser, taser, taser.

461
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,000
Go, go, let me out !

462
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,840
Okay, first of all...

463
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,000
Do you have to say "taser"
three times

464
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,720
before tasing someone ?
You're not tasing Beetlejuice.

465
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,200
And second: no one should
want to stadium so badly

466
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,560
they're willing to electrocute
an old man for it.

467
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,560
And look, I know sports can make people
behave irationally.

468
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,040
For instance, somewhere,

469
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,440
there is a man with this actual tattoo
of Tim Tebow as a centaur.

470
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,320
That makes no sense.

471
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,400
But we have to come to our senses
and stop signing these deals.

472
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,400
And if you thinking, "well, John
there's no way it's just too hard."

473
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,480
Let me persuade you to fight back
in the only way that I know works:

474
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,040
an inspirational halftime speech
set to music.

475
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,040
So you know what, let's do it.

476
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,200
Please, American sports fans,

477
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,000
I'm going to need you to join me
in the locker room.

478
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,440
It turns out we need
to have ourselves a talk.

479
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,800
An emotional inspiring talk.

480
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,880
So gather round.

481
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,800
And at home
you might want to take a knee.

482
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,560
I know things look bad out there.

483
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,000
These owners have been humiliating
us for decades.

484
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,480
And sure, we could just give up.

485
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,680
We could roll over and let them
do it to us for another 20 years.

486
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,920
We could do that.

487
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,080
Or... right here Tonight !

488
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,560
We could decide to fight back !

489
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,600
And I'm not saying we shouldn't have

490
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,040
giant aquariums in ballparks,
full of terrified fish.

491
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,600
Of course we should.
This is America.

492
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,920
If we don't have them,
no one else will.

493
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,240
But we should not be using
public money to pay for them.

494
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,320
And yeah, teams might threaten
to leave you.

495
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,520
That might happen.

496
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,920
But I happen to believe
that your cities

497
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,800
are more than just the teams
who happen to play there.

498
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,720
St. Louis, stand up !
Stand up, St. Louis and look at me !

499
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,760
You're more than just the Rams !

500
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,480
You're a proud Midwestern metropolis.

501
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,200
You're home of the St. Louis Arch !

502
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,400
San Diego !

503
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,320
You're the second largest city
in California !

504
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,960
That's not nothing !
That's a solid number two.

505
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,520
And you Cincinnati.

506
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,760
You're the home
of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame !

507
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,080
That's Cleveland.

508
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,440
Well, you're the hometown
of astronaut Jim Lovell

509
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,720
and Emmy award-winning
actress Carol Kane !

510
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,360
- That's Cleveland as well.
- Shit, I'm sorry.

511
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,160
You might have
to hang on to the Bengals.

512
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,560
But for the rest of you...

513
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,040
I want you to look deep down inside
your heart I want you to dig in there,

514
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,120
and I want you to find something.

515
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,120
And it's gonna seem tiny, but it's the
most powerful thing in the world.

516
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,920
And it's the word "no".
"No."

517
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,200
So when a billionaire asks you

518
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,240
to buy him a hologram machine
that doesn't exist yet,

519
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,400
what are you gonna say ?

520
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,800
- "No !"
- That's right !

521
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,720
And when they ask you for public money
without opening their books

522
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,240
what are you gonna say to him ?

523
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,360
- No !
- That's right !

524
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,480
And when they ask you
if they can keep all the money

525
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,000
for calling their arenas
"Smoothie King Center"

526
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,840
what are you gonna
say to them ?

527
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
- No !
- Fuck, no ! That's right.

528
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,480
Because that's a stupid name
for anything, even a smoothie store.

529
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:49,800
So listen to me,
'cause I want you all to get out there,

530
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,240
and the next time a team comes around
asking for a new stadium,

531
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,240
I want you to make them pay !

532
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,560
- What are you gonna do ?
- Make them pay !

533
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,960
- What are you gonna do ?
- Make them pay !

534
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,560
- What are you gonna do ?
- Make them pay !

535
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,680
- Clear eyes, full hearts !
- Can't lose !

536
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,480
Let's go do this !

537
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,400

542
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,160
Make them pay !

543
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,000
Make them pay !
