LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,880
Season II,
Episode 25

3
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,640
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight" !
Thank you so much for joining us.

4
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,480
I'm John Oliver. Just time
for a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,280
And we begin in Cuba,

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,480
home to the world's least fun
Castro District.

7
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,840
On Friday,
Cuba made history.

8
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,840
Today, the flag of the United States
was raised over the US Embassy

9
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,920
in Havana.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,520
With Secretary of State
John Kerry looking on,

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,880
three US Marines hoisted the flag
up a pole at the embassy

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,480
for the first time in 54 years.

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,680
Finally. The universal symbol
of freedom and liberty is flying

14
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,080
in Cuba someplace other
than Guantanamo Bay.

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,640
But it wasn't just
a symbolic flag raising.

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,120
The reopening of the Embassy
gave Secretary of State John Kerry

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,480
a chance to dust off his freshman year
"Qué tal ?" textbook.

18
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,960
I say on behalf of my country,

19
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,400
Los Estados Unitos acogen
con beneplacito

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:36,520
este nuevo comienzo de su relation
con el pueblo y el govierno de Cuba.

21
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,600
No bueno.

22
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,480
You sound like a Rosetta Stone,
and not the software.

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,800
You sound like an actual rock
trying to speak Spanish.

24
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,040
The negotiations to get us to this point
are way too complicated

25
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,200
to get into right now.

26
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,880
Suffice to say, they involved
Senator Patrick Leahy,

27
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,960
the pope
and the nation of Canada.

28
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,160
But perhaps the most amazing detail
was that, at one point,

29
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,040
the negotiations actually hinged
on this.

30
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,760
A wild story involving
the artificial insemination

31
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,720
of the wife of one
of the Cuban prisoners

32
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,360
being held in the United States
with Leahys bringing...

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,000
...the semen from the prisoner
in the United States to Havana

34
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,680
so she could become pregnant.

35
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,320
It's true. Apparently as part
of the effort to close the deal,

36
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,120
last year Senator Patrick Leahy
helped facilitate

37
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,480
the artificial insemination
of a Cuban prisoner's wife

38
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,480
by ensuring safe passage
for his sperm.

39
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,080
And let this be a lesson
to anyone who thinks

40
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,440
international diplomacy
is glamorous,

41
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,400
because it is not just cocktail parties
and high-level meetings.

42
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,840
Once in a while, your job may include

43
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,400
making sure an international flight
takes off with a carry-on bag

44
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,520
containing, presumably, less than
three ounces of warm Cuban jizz.

45
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,120
That's an adult's job.
That is diplomacy.

46
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,680
Let's move on now
to American history,

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,880
the thing that Disney's "Pocahontas"
improved on.

48
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,280
This week gave closure to a rumor

49
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,320
that has been intriguing
US historians for years.

50
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,760
And it is confirmed.

51
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,240
President Warren G. Harding
did have a daughter out of wedlock.

52
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,440
"The New York Times" reports
DNA testing now proved

53
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,240
the 29th president fathered
a child by a mistress,

54
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,880
Nan Britton,
before he was elected.

55
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,400
Yes, it's official.
Warren G. Harding had a love child,

56
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,520
pretty impressive for a man
who looks like

57
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,240
someone put two napping caterpillars
on an angry bald eagle's forehead

58
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,960
and then dressed it
in Tucker Carlson's clothes.

59
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,880
But the revelation came
as vindication

60
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,240
for the family of his mistress,
Nan Britton.

61
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,000
I could fill you in
on the details of this story,

62
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,080
but I would much rather let the team
at "Good Day Columbus" do it.

63
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,880
You know who was a hottie in his day
who might have been on one of these ?

64
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,680
Turns out...

65
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,760
Warren G. Harding
had a love child.

66
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,960
Marion's own Warren G. Harding,
president of these United States.

67
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,760
Quite the scandal in the '20s.

68
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,960
The family has long since denied.

69
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,160
The two families have been kind
of circling each other,

70
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,680
going: "This is for real."

71
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,360
"No, it's not for real.
You're making it up."

72
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,200
I want to learn about every world event
from those two people.

73
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,360
So ISIS was all like:
"We want to take over Syria."

74
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,240
And Syria was like:
"Nuh-uh."

75
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,600
And ISIS was like: "Uh-huh."

76
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,840
Anyway, casualties number
in the thousands.

77
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,680
But I for one am glad that Harding's
love child has been confirmed,

78
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,680
because there were parts of this story
that were simply too good not be true.

79
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,400
After Warren Harding
died in 1923,

80
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,160
Nan Britton wrote a book claiming
she'd been his mistress,

81
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,880
they'd made love
in a White House closet,

82
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,680
and he'd fathered
her daughter, Elizabeth.

83
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,120
With all due respect
to his mistress,

84
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,040
you did not make love
in a White House closet.

85
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,440
You banged in Warren's Fuck Bunker.

86
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,920
That is what happened because
that is what he called it.

87
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,960
But the much bigger point here is
Harding's presidential legacy

88
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,440
must clearly be updated.

89
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,880
He probably hoped to be remembered
for the Fordney-McCumber Tariff Act.

90
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,720
But from now on, the only thing
we should teach children in school

91
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,680
is that Warren G. Harding
not only had a love child,

92
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,080
he had a hush-hush closet bang
with a fangirl named Nan.

93
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,960
We must educate
our children in history.

94
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,720
And finally this week,
New Zealand,

95
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,480
Australia's Australia.

96
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,840
You may recall that last year
New Zealand announced

97
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,000
it was redesigning its flag
for a very simple reason.

98
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,520
Australia's flag
is in the background.

99
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,040
You can see the
Union Jack in the left corner,

100
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,160
against a blue background
with white stars.

101
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,240
New Zealand's flag
is in the foreground.

102
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,160
The only distinguishing feature,
the stars are red, not white,

103
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,600
with fewer points.

104
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,920
New Zealand's flag is different
from the Australian flag

105
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,240
the same way that "Ice Ice Baby"
is different from "Under Pressure".

106
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,040
They're basically the same,
but one is clearly worse.

107
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,040
Now, this is not
a unique problem.

108
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,360
Lots of countries have similar flags.
Romania and Chad,

109
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,320
or Monaco and Indonesia.

110
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,400
But New Zealand has opened
a flag design contest to the public

111
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,800
and received 10 000 entries,

112
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,160
which this week they narrowed
to a short list of just 40.

113
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,320
And people do not seem
particularly inspired.

114
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,200
Bit of a joke, to be honest.

115
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,160
It's turned into a wee bit of a joke.

116
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,480
Most people don't care about it
anymore.

117
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,440
Maybe 5% of the people
are taking it seriously.

118
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,760
The rest of us are more concerned
about much more serious issues.

119
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,000
Which one would you pick ?

120
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,200
- Probably that one.
- Why is that ?

121
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,280
I guess 'cause it's really similar
to the one we've got already.

122
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,160
That is negative. You are going about
this with the enthusiasm

123
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,640
of a distant uncle buying a present
for a two-year-old nephew.

124
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,520
Look, I just need something
that has three colors

125
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,200
and takes up physical space.
I don't know what it likes !

126
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,240
And I think I know why this has not
captured the public imagination.

127
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,480
The 40 flags on the short list
are pretty boring, which is ridiculous

128
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,000
because the government put all
the rejected flag designs online

129
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,800
and some of them are incredible.

130
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,800
For instance, how did
this one not make the cut ?

131
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,240
The title, it's actual title,
is New Zealand's True Nature.

132
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,120
It looks like a very confused
child's depiction

133
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,120
of where they think
babies come from.

134
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,600
That would be an incredible flag.

135
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,600
Many of the other great designs
feature the kiwi bird,

136
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,120
which ordinarily I would not advise
because it looks less like a bird

137
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,920
and more like a dumb, fat mouse
who got his face stuck on a straw.

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,760
It is hard not to get behind
this actual flag design

139
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,880
of a kiwi blasting lasers
from its eyes.

140
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,320
You would remember that flag !

141
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,960
If you ever saw that flag,
it would be impossible

142
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,440
not to immediately
pledge allegiance to it.

143
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,480
But I have to say the greatest
flag design of all,

144
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,640
and I cannot believe this
did not make the short list,

145
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,000
was this one titled Eggsplosion.

146
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,040
And the artist's explanation
for his design is:

147
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,200
"Because New Zealanders like eggs
and explosions are cool."

148
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,600
Please, New Zealand,
I'm begging you,

149
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,360
when it comes time to vote
for your new flag,

150
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,600
write "Eggsplosion" down,
'cause that's the greatest thing !

151
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,840
And now, this.

152
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,720
Six more actual flag designs
submitted

153
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,560
to the New Zealand Government with
descriptions of what they look like.

154
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,080
Bird in police floodlight
failing field sobriety test.

155
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,520
Flag that's just one boot short
of a swastika.

156
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,080
Unauthorized Hasidic
Mr. Potato Head.

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,440
Kiwi going through heroin withdrawal.

158
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,520
A cat having the world's
most boring cat dream.

159
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,320
And kiwi dressed as The Fonz
for some reason.

160
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,760
Moving on.

161
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,920
Our main story tonight
concerns churches,

162
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,760
America's favorite place for redemption
and sixth favorite place for chicken.

163
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,320
Churches are a cornerstone
of American life.

164
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,160
There are roughly
350 000 congregations

165
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,080
in the United States,
and many of them do great work,

166
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,640
feeding the hungry,
clothing the poor.

167
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,920
But this is not
a story about them.

168
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This is about the churches who exploit
people's faith for monetary gain.

169
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,760
You probably think of 1980s
televangelists like this guy.

170
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,120
I'm just getting
into a prophetic vein.

171
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,200
Someone with a digestive tract
problem, quickly call.

172
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,960
We've seen midgets grow.

173
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,880
We've seen limbs that stopped growing
because the growth cells have stopped.

174
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,400
I don't make this stuff up !

175
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,160
Please. You can't say
"I don't make this stuff up"

176
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,760
just five seconds
after you said the words...

177
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,520
That man is Robert Tilton and though
he, like many televangelists,

178
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,200
was caught up in an exposé decades
ago, he never really went away.

179
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,240
Healing going to those knees.
Arthritis, go in the name of Jesus !

180
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,040
Tumors, go in the name of Jesus !

181
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,880
That one calling with lupus.
Lupus, you foul devil.

182
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,400
You bow to the name of Jesus.

183
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,640
Lupus, you bow to the name
of Jesus.

184
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,040
You go in Jesus's name !

185
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,080
Lupus, you complicated and not
especially easy to describe malady,

186
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,520
you go, lupus !

187
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,680
You vex us
with your foul lupus-ness. You go !

188
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,240
Though you may not be aware of it,

189
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,000
televangelism is still
thriving in this country

190
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,640
and Robert Tilton is just
a very small part of it.

191
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,920
There are several large media networks
devoted to televangelism,

192
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,520
including Trinity,
Inspiration Ministries and Daystar.

193
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,960
And the preachers that appear on them
can have incredible lifestyles.

194
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,040
Just earlier this year,
a man named Creflo Dollar

195
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,720
got people's attention
with a bold request.

196
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,480
Pastor Creflo Dollar of the World
Changers Church International

197
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,840
facing harsh criticism
after starting a fundraising campaign

198
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,680
to buy this 65 million dollar
luxury private jet.

199
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,560
If I want to believe God
for a 65 million dollar plane,

200
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,280
you cannot stop me.

201
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,200
You cannot stop me from dreaming !

202
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,960
"You cannot stop
me from dreaming"

203
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,960
is not how you ask
for 65 million dollars.

204
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,720
It's what you scream at your father
when he says

205
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,600
you'll never be a Broadway dancer.
"I can do it, Dad !"

206
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,000
"I've got the music in me !"
But here's the thing.

207
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,200
Creflo Dollar wanting a private jet
is not remotely unusual.

208
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,760
There is a pattern of preachers wanting
high-end airplanes.

209
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,520
And when they get them, they're not
always particularly humble about it.

210
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,720
I had enough money to buy
a beautiful Cessna Citation Jet, cash.

211
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,600
I sense there's so much
jealousy in this room tonight

212
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,680
that I can feel over this.

213
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,800
A few weeks later,
I bought another one

214
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,040
worth three times
what that one was. Cash.

215
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,240
Act happy over my blessing, folks.

216
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,600
"I bought a jet, cash.
I bought a bigger jet, cash."

217
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,720
"Fuck the haters.
Act happy for me."

218
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,360
That's not a sermon.

219
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,800
It's the first draft
of a Rick Ross single.

220
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,760
Now, preachers claim
these planes are vital tools.

221
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,600
Look at Kenneth Copeland,
who along with his wife Gloria

222
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,640
are among the most successful
TV evangelists.

223
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,880
A few years back,
he asked his followers

224
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,720
to help buy a 20 million dollar jet,
promising it would only be used

225
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,680
for church business,
but a local news crew did some digging

226
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,880
and what they found will
probably not surprise you.

227
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,360
It was a News 8
investigation last February

228
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,400
which first raised questions about
Copeland's apparently personal use

229
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,240
of his new church jet.

230
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,560
This is a preaching machine.

231
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,840
Most notably for a ski trip
to Colorado

232
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,160
and visits to an exotic game ranch
in South Texas.

233
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,840
Here's Copeland
and his son John proudly poising

234
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,600
with a pair of axis deer,

235
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,880
indigenous to India and Sri Lanka.

236
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,960
Holy shit !

237
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,960
This guy's like a psychotic,
reverse Noah.

238
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,480
Two by two, male and female
came to Kenneth Copeland

239
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,040
and he doth shot them
right between the fucking eyes.

240
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,760
Now, Copeland's ministry
will tell you

241
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,000
that he reimburses the church,

242
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,000
but that still means he has private jet
reimbursement money.

243
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,000
Despite that personal wealth,

244
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,120
people still
send Kenneth Copeland,

245
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,680
Creflo Dollar, and that asshole
with two planes lots and lots of money,

246
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,440
and that's partly because they preach
the Prosperity Gospel,

247
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,400
which argues that wealth
is a sign of God's favor

248
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,800
and donations will result
in wealth coming back to you.

249
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,880
That idea sometimes
takes the form of seed faith,

250
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,880
the notion that donations are seeds
that you will one day get to harvest.

251
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,400
Let me show you.

252
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,640
The size of your seed

253
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,600
will determine the size
of your harvest.

254
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,240
I don't understand why,
but something happens

255
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,440
at a level where people step
into faith and give 1 000 dollars

256
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,640
that don't happen at other levels.

257
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,480
You're going to
have a breakthrough

258
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,080
through this 273 dollar seed.

259
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,600
All you've got is 1 000 dollars.

260
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,760
Listen, that's not enough
money anyway to buy the house.

261
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,600
You're trying to get
out of the apartment.

262
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,320
That's not enough
money anyway.

263
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,560
You put that seed in the ground
and watch God work it out.

264
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,280
The argument is sow
your money in the ground

265
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,560
and you will reap returns
multiple times over.

266
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,280
Except as an investment,

267
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,480
you'd be better off burying your money
in the actual ground

268
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,080
because there is a chance your dog
may dig it up and give it back to you.

269
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,160
Good boy.

270
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,720
But it can get
even more predatory,

271
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,000
'cause if say
you don't have 1 000 dollars,

272
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,560
or perhaps have
significant credit card debts,

273
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,920
seed faith can still
work for you.

274
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,640
I have a feeling that somebody

275
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,080
that wants a credit card debt
wiped out,

276
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,560
that if you'll use
your faith as you sow,

277
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,840
as you sow the 1 000 dollars
on a credit card,

278
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,920
as you use your faith,

279
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,440
God's gonna wipe out your
credit card indebtedness.

280
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,160
That is the equivalent
of saying the key to you losing weight

281
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,160
lies at the bottom of this giant bag
of peanut butter M&M's.

282
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,120
Go find it.
It's definitely down there.

283
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:48,880
All of this would be amusing
if the targets of these messages

284
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,080
were not often vulnerable people
like Bonnie Parker.

285
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,880
She did not seek
medical treatment for cancer,

286
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,480
instead choosing to sow money into
Kenneth Copeland's church.

287
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,120
And I'll let her daughter
pick it up from there.

288
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,840
I started finding notebooks
not long after she passed away.

289
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,560
She believed, and I know she believed,
cause this is in the notebooks,

290
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,280
that if she sowed enough seed,
which was money...

291
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,800
The greater amount
of seed that you sow,

292
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,520
according to them, the better chance
you have of getting healed.

293
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,960
At this point, I think it's clear
that seed faith

294
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,880
is the most disgusting
seed based concept

295
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,200
since whatever the fuck
chia seed pudding is.

296
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,840
Bonnie Parker gave thousands of dollars
to the Copelands' church

297
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,720
because she believed it was
her best chance of beating cancer.

298
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,160
And you might think:
"Well, that's crazy !"

299
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,680
It's not an unreasonable interpretation
of the Copelands' preachings.

300
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,120
Gloria Copeland sells
numerous products

301
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,200
on "healing through faith"
and has been skeptical in the past

302
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,040
about going to the doctor.

303
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,320
We know wthat's wrong with you.
You've got cancer.

304
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,160
The bad news is,
we don't know what to do about it,

305
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,480
except give you some poison
that'll make you sicker.

306
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,400
Now, which do you want to do ?

307
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,360
Do you want to do that
or do you want to sit here,

308
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,600
hear the word of God

309
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,920
and let faith come into your heart
and be healed ? Hallelujah.

310
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,560
It's pretty clear that woman cannot hear
the word of God,

311
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,360
because if she could,
I'm pretty sure he'd be shouting

312
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,600
"fuck you, Gloria"
right in her ear.

313
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:29,520
And yet, not only is everything
you've seen so far legal,

314
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,280
but the money people donate
in response to it is tax-free.

315
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,240
If you're registered as a religious
non-profit, or especially a church,

316
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,080
you are given broad exemptions
over taxation and regulation.

317
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,960
The IRS in fact produced
a scintillating video

318
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,280
instructing its agents
how to treat churches.

319
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,960
It contains a phrase that you wouldn't
normally associate with the agency.

320
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,640
Welcome to Churches and Religious
Organizations Dos and Don'ts.

321
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,160
For reasons as old
as the United States,

322
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,640
the tax laws and regulations
that govern churches

323
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,080
and religious organizations
are purposely broad

324
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,440
and sometimes a little vague.

325
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,400
A little vague ?

326
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,160
They are under-selling that

327
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,600
because the films of Christopher Nolan
are a little vague.

328
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,640
A text from your mom reading

329
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,080
"please call, not an emergency,
but please call, very important"

330
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,680
is a little vague !

331
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,240
The IRS regulations
are close to meaningless.

332
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,640
According to their tax codes, the term
"church" is not specifically defined

333
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,440
and they make no attempt to evaluate

334
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,880
whether the content
of a doctrine is religious,

335
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,320
provided the beliefs are truly held
and are not illegal.

336
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,080
But truly held beliefs that are not
illegal is almost every belief.

337
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,440
Bros before hos,
that could be a religion.

338
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,960
Red Vines are better than Twizzlers,
that could be a religion.

339
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,200
If you believe the best movie ever made
is "Lady in the Water",

340
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,040
then your name
is M. Night Shyamalan.

341
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,880
But congratulations, Mr. Shyamalan,
that belief could be a religion.

342
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,920
And being designated a church
confers all sorts of benefits

343
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,840
like the parsonage allowance,

344
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,320
which allows the Copelands
to live in a 6.3 million dollar house

345
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,040
tax-exempt. This is their house.

346
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,040
That is a parsonage,
which only makes sense

347
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,760
if by parsonage they mean

348
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,120
"house that looks like it cost the net
worth of Jim Parsons".

349
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,000
We asked the IRS how many churches
they've audited in recent years,

350
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,720
and they did one in 2014
and just two in 2013.

351
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,720
The odds of a church
getting audited are basically the same

352
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,880
as Gloria Copeland curing your
fucking cancer.

353
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,520
And when you can operate...
Here's the thing.

354
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,480
When you can operate
with so little oversight,

355
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,000
it is amazing
what you are able to do.

356
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,480
Look at Robert Tilton.

357
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,360
If you ever send him a donation,
you cannot imagine what happens.

358
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,160
And luckily,
you don't have to imagine,

359
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,240
because, and we should
probably come clean here,

360
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,280
we have been involved
in a correspondence

361
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,080
with Robert Tilton's church
for the last seven months

362
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,280
to try and find out
what he tells people.

363
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,560
So settle in,
because this gets incredible.

364
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,040
Back in January,
I sent him 20 dollars

365
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,320
and asked to be added
to his mailing list.

366
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
Within two weeks,
he sent me a letter

367
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,520
thanking me for my donation
and claiming

368
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,880
"I believe God has supernaturally
brought us together".

369
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,880
"Supernatural" is a bit of a stretch.

370
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,000
I saw him on TV
and I sent him money.

371
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,160
He wasn't my dead lover who came
back to help me with some pottery.

372
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,960
Soon afterwards, he sent
me a second letter

373
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,400
and inside there was a 1 dollar bill,
which was exciting

374
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,680
until I saw the inscription
instructing me to send it back to him

375
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,600
with your best Prove God
tithes or offering.

376
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,400
That's right,
I had to send the dollar back

377
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,200
with an additional recommended
offering of 37 dollars, which I did.

378
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,760
So at this point,
we're just two letters in

379
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,600
and already it's like
having a pen pal who's in deep

380
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,080
with some loan sharks.

381
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,000
This correspondence continued
back and forth like this until March,

382
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,080
when he sent me three small packets
of colored oil,

383
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,080
that I was instructed to pour
on letters and send back to him

384
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,840
by a specific date
along with more money.

385
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,000
So I did that.

386
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,880
And in April, I got a letter
in a manila envelope

387
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,840
with the message
"chech enclosed".

388
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,240
I thought: "Fantastic !"

389
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,800
"I've seeded and I've seeded
and I've seeded."

390
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,360
"Here comes my harvest."

391
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,760
Then I opened it.
It was a check for 5 dollars

392
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,480
from me made out
to Pastor Tilton's church.

393
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,920
This went on
for seven more letters,

394
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,080
and then he sent me
a piece of fabric

395
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,760
in the shape of some mountains.

396
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,200
I assumed I'd somehow reached
the mountain level.

397
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,160
And surprise, surprise, he asked me
to send those mountains back to him

398
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,960
with some more money.

399
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,080
So I did and then
he sent me another letter

400
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,240
with another single
dollar bill inside.

401
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,440
He told me to put that dollar bill
in my Bible for one night

402
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,160
and then send it back the next day
with 49 more dollars

403
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,400
so that he can have it blessed
with oil

404
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,320
and send me a 1 dollar bill back
that has been blessed.

405
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,920
He added: "I must warn you not to rob
God with your tithes and offerings."

406
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,160
"Do not let this one dollar bill
stay in your house."

407
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,040
I kept that 1 dollar bill
because fuck him.

408
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,880
That's why.
So that one I kept.

409
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,760
But that did not stop him.

410
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,800
The letters kept on coming.

411
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,760
I received another oil packet,
more prayer cloths,

412
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,880
and even, and this is true,
an outline of his foot,

413
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,960
which I was asked
to trace my foot on

414
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,520
and mail back to him
with more money !

415
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,640
So as of tonight
I've sent him 319 dollars

416
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,320
and received 26 letters.
That's almost one a week.

417
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,400
And again, this is all hilarious
until you imagine

418
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,720
these letters being sent to someone
who cannot afford what he's asking for.

419
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,720
So at this point,
I was getting pretty angry

420
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,120
and looking for a sign
of what to do.

421
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,360
So I watched a little more
Robert Tilton

422
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,640
and the most
amazing thing happened.

423
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,640
There's a person watching me

424
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,560
and you've been very frustrated
with your purpose in life.

425
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,280
That might be me, Bob !

426
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,000
'Cause I'm extremely
frustrated right now

427
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,560
as it seems my purpose
in the last seven months

428
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,800
has been to send you money
through the fucking mail !

429
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,440
So I will ask,

430
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,000
what's that message
that you have for me ?

431
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,680
That's so strong.
Just then, I had a word of knowledge

432
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,360
for someone that's really
been seeking God

433
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,640
for a particular purpose
or a decision in your life.

434
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,120
And that is when I realized the message
Robert Tilton was sending me

435
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,080
was that I should set up
my own church to test

436
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,480
the legal and financial limits of what
religious entities are able to do.

437
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,400
And so that is what we have done.

438
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,640
We filed paperwork last week
establishing a church called

439
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:15,080
Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption,
and it was disturbingly easy.

440
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,120
To make sure
we did this correctly,

441
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,520
we had this actual tax lawyer
walk us through the process.

442
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,480
Now, while the IRS does not
have a definition of a church,

443
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,480
they do have a 14-point test
as a guideline for churches.

444
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,640
But not only do you not
have to meet all 14 points,

445
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,600
we'd already met some
of them by accident.

446
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,040
For instance, you need
an "established place of worship",

447
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,120
but we meet every Sunday
in this studio in New York.

448
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,160
And apparently,
that genuinely counts.

449
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,560
Our lawyer also advised us

450
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,240
our church needed to be
a distinct legal entity,

451
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,760
so we registered our church
as a non-profit corporation

452
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,480
in Texas,
a state I do not live in,

453
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,720
have never lived in,

454
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,520
but which is somehow completely fine
for us to incorporate a church in.

455
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,120
Now, the IRS's guidelines suggest
you need a creed and form of worship,

456
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,640
but our lawyer suggested we could
fulfill the worship requirement

457
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,520
by merely leading everyone
"in some specific ritual,"

458
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,360
"such as having congregants
meditate"

459
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,760
"on the nature of fraudulent
churches".

460
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,720
So let us do exactly that
and bow our heads

461
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,120
in silent contemplation.

462
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,400
And lo,
another box was ticked.

463
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,080
Amen.

464
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,240
And finally,
according to our attorney,

465
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,600
"the best case for church
membership will be made"

466
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,040
"by the individuals who are present
in the live studio audience,"

467
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,040
"who will profess belief
in the church's creed".

468
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,360
So what do you say,
live studio audience ?

469
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,400
Do you profess your belief ?

470
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,640
I said, do you profess your belief
tonight, brothers and sisters ?

471
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,960
Then there is only one thing
left for us to do !

472
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,240
Let's go to church.

473
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,480
Brothers and sisters,

474
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,400
welcome to Our Lady
of Perpetual Exemption.

475
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,280
I am your mega-reverend...
Thank you, brothers and sisters.

476
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,640
I'm your mega-reverend
and CEO, John Oliver.

477
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,400
I am so blessed tonight
to be joined by my radiant wife,

478
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,720
Wanda Jo Oliver.
Please welcome her.

479
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,360
Wanda Jo, praise be.

480
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,080
Praise be, Wanda Jo.

481
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,600
And praise be to all
of you watching us tonight

482
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:39,480
or joining us online at
www.ourladyofperpetualexemption.com.

483
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,320
But most of all,
praise be to the IRS,

484
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,320
that most permissive
of government agencies.

485
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,280
Wanda Jo, I have heard
the word of prophecy.

486
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,840
Hallelujah !
What did it say, my John ?

487
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,720
I'll tell ya, my Wanda.

488
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,400
It says the viewers at home
must plant a seed !

489
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,320
A seed ! An almighty seed !

490
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,600
Preferably in the form of cash,
although we do take checks.

491
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,560
It can be 5 dollars,
10 dollars, 77 dollars.

492
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,960
We need you to sow
your biggest seed !

493
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,560
That's money !
Don't send us seed.

494
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,160
That's right.
Please do not send us actual seeds.

495
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,160
Because we ain't
interested in your seeds !

496
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,520
Please send us your actual money

497
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,680
to the address
at the bottom of your screen.

498
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,160
If you do this, and this is real,
great things will happen to you.

499
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,800
That's apparently something
I'm allowed to say.

500
