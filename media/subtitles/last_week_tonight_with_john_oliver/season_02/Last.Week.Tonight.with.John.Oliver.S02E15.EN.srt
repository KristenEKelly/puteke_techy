00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,000
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,200
Season 2
Episode 15

3
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,000
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,920
I'm John Oliver,
thank you so much for being with us.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,560
Just time for a quick recap
of the week.

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,320
And we begin in Cuba.

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,560
Or as JFK used
to pronounce it, "Booty Island."

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,760
The U.S. has had a tempestuous
relationship with Cuba over the years.

9
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,320
And this week brought
a major development.

10
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,880
The breaking news, the United States
now has formally dropped Cuba

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,520
from its list of
state-sponsors of terrorism.

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,600
It's frankly about time,

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,720
because arguably
the largest act of terrorism

14
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,600
that Cuba has inspired
in the last 30 years

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,920
was "Dirty Dancing:
Havana Nights."

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,840
Until Friday, Cuba had been
one of just four countries on the list,

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,200
along with Iran, Sudan
and Syria.

18
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,320
And it did always feel
like Cuba was the odd one out there.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,040
It's like someone saying,
"I've got a deal with my husband.

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,920
"I can sleep with four other people.
So my list is Ryan Gosling,

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,360
"Chris Pratt, Idris Elba,
and beloved sitcom actor Jon Cryer."

22
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,440
Really ? I'd love to hear
your rationale behind that last one.

23
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,440
Because it's worth noting
even the State Department

24
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,800
did not seem to know
why Cuba was on the list.

25
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,640
Their most recent entry
said that there was "no indication

26
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,040
"Cuba provided weapons
or training to terrorist groups."

27
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,120
So it was more that Cuba
liked the idea of terrorism.

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,280
They were into terrorism the same way
a kid in a Salt Lake City mall

29
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,400
is into the Crips.

30
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,680
Sure you are, Brandon.

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,880
Sure you are.

32
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,040
But now Cuba's been taken
off the list,

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,240
which clearly presents
a number of opportunities.

34
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,920
Under the plan, economic
sanctions would also be lifted

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,360
encouraging business
and tourism in Cuba.

36
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,000
And it is tourism
which might change Cuba's mind

37
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,600
over whether this week's news
was good or not.

38
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,400
'Cause I give them about three months
of being overrun with American tourists

39
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,160
asking where they can find
the most authentic mojito

40
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,920
before they say,

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,480
"You know what ? It turns out
we are pretty terror-ish after all.

42
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,560
"You guys might wanna put us
back on that list, please."

43
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,880
Let's move on to Nebraska.

44
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,600
A state you think about
so little,

45
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,520
you didn't even realize
that's not Nebraska, this is Nebraska.

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,160
Come on, it's your country.
That's not okay.

47
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,480
Nebraska had some big
and surprising news this week.

48
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,880
Nebraska is now the first
conservative state

49
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,560
in more than 40 years
to abolish the death penalty.

50
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,520
That's right. You will
no longer be sentenced

51
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,040
to death by lethal injection
in Nebraska.

52
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,640
Unless you count drinking their
subsidized corn syrup through a straw.

53
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,360
Which is slow acting,
but it will get you in the end.

54
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,640
Nebraska has become the 19th state
to outlaw the death penalty.

55
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,200
But it wasn't easy. Their governor, and
enormous human thumb, Pete Ricketts,

56
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,840
was staunchly opposed
to the whole idea.

57
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,600
"My words cannot express
how appalled I am

58
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,400
"that we have lost
a critical tool

59
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,880
"to protect law enforcement
and Nebraska families."

60
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,080
Words cannot express ?
Why don't you try.

61
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,880
It's a written public statement,
you giant shaved owl.

62
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,320
And incidentally, they picked
the perfect photo there.

63
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,920
Just look how happy he is
at the idea of lethal injections.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,200
Interestingly,
one of the reasons lawmakers

65
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,840
voted to repeal
the death penalty

66
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,760
was purely practical,
as it's become increasingly difficult

67
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,680
to obtain the necessary drugs
for executions.

68
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,920
And watch how Ricketts tried
to overcome that objection.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,080
Yesterday, Nebraska governor
Pete Ricketts

70
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,160
announced the state

71
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,440
has successfully purchased drugs
to administer the death penalty.

72
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,520
So he's essentially saying, "Hey, guys,
great news. I found the murder drugs

73
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
"that I've been looking for."

74
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,920
How is that good news, you unpeeled
hard-boiled egg with teeth ?

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,880
But it turned out, anyway,
his plan was a little flawed.

76
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,320
First, the drugs he found
were located in India

77
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,160
and cost nearly $55,000
in taxpayer money.

78
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,920
And that's expensive. We are talking
Adderall in the Yale library

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,320
during finals week expensive.

80
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,880
And secondly, there was this.

81
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,440
The FDA tells us, quote,

82
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,560
"With very limited
exceptions, which do not apply here,

83
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,120
"it is unlawful
to import this drug

84
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,880
"and FDA would refuse
its admission into the United States."

85
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,280
And that is pathetic.

86
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,240
Because saying that you've got
access to high-quality drugs from India

87
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,520
and then not being able to
deliver is embarrassing enough

88
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,440
when you're a high school junior trying
to get into your prom date's pants.

89
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,920
It is downright humiliating when you
are the adult governor of a state

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,200
trying to desperately kill people,
you dollar store Lex Luthor.

91
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,480
And lastly this week,

92
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,720
let's move on to Ireland.

93
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,160
A country with a slightly higher Irish
population than the Dropkick Murphys.

94
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,720
While we were off last week,
Ireland had a historic vote.

95
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,560
This is the moment same sex
supporters in Ireland

96
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,480
knew they'd made history.

97
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,880
Irish voters said a resounding "yes"
to gay marriage

98
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,920
by a margin of two to one.

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,200
That is the most...
That's right.

100
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,720
That is the most resounding
Irish endorsement of homosexuality

101
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,160
since Lucky Charms added
the rainbow marshmallow.

102
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,840
The vote was helped by heartwarming
ads from the "yes vote" camp,

103
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,600
such as the "bring your family
with you" commercial.

104
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,000
Dad ? Will you come with me ?

105
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,880
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

106
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,880
Mom. Come on.

107
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,960
It's time.

108
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,920
That ad is a moving testament to love
crossing generational boundaries.

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,680
Although, it would also make
a chilling scene

110
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,800
from a movie about Irish millennials

111
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,240
euthanizing their parents.

112
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,800
"Mom, it's time.

113
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,840
"Now go ahead and walk into the ocean
like the prophecy demands.

114
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,000
"It's time, Ma.
It's time."

115
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,160
The Irish vote
was widely celebrated

116
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,680
with one depressingly
predictable voice of dissent.

117
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,720
A sharp rejection today of Ireland's
historic same sex marriage vote

118
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,520
from the Catholic Church.

119
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,480
The Vatican's secretary of state
called the result a, quote,

120
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,440
"defeat for humanity."

121
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,920
Okay, settle down a little,
Catholic Church.

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Remember, you're an organization whose
victories for humanity include

123
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,280
the Crusades, forced adoptions,
and running

124
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,880
a wildly successful international
pedophile exchange program.

125
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,360
So let's save the "defeat
for humanity" accusation

126
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,440
for things that truly
deserve it, like this:

127
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,840
We're turning bacon
upside down.

128
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,080
Introducing
Perfect Bacon Bowl.

129
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,560
And try this:
a Bacon Bowl ice cream sundae.

130
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,600
Salty sweet,
and fun to eat.

131
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,280
That is a defeat for humanity.

132
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,480
Because we are destroying civilization
one manipulated pork form at a time.

133
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,920
But the Vatican's blinkered stance made
a little more sense in the context

134
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,880
of a seemingly unrelated piece
of information that came out this week.

135
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,600
One person who definitely
is not watching our broadcast tonight,

136
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,960
Pope Francis. In fact, he told
an Argentinian newspaper

137
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,000
that he hasn't watched
television in 25 years.

138
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,880
He says he simply decided
it wasn't for him.

139
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,920
Oh, I'm sorry, Pope.
This isn't for you ?

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,240
This is, actually,
that's a good instinct.

141
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,080
This show is definitely
not for you.

142
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,640
It's why in the little warning card
at the top of every episode

143
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,920
it says "UP:
unsuitable for popes."

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,120
But it is a shame because it might
have helped if the Pope

145
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,280
had been watching TV
over the last 25 years.

146
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,320
TV shows have done a lot to acclimate
people to same sex relationships.

147
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,880
There was "Will and Grace,"
there was "Ellen,"

148
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,920
"Queer as Folk,"
"SpongeBob SquarePants."

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,560
Oh, please. They hang out
in a pineapple under the sea.

150
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,520
Read between the lines.

151
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,880
I'm just saying, Pope,
if you'd watched TV,

152
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,840
not only would you
have learned a lot,

153
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,000
but there are shows that
you might have really liked.

154
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,320
If nothing else, I think you'd
have loved "Breaking Bad."

155
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,520
That's a show you
could really relate to.

156
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,360
It's a story about a man
gradually losing touch with reality,

157
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,640
overseeing a vast criminal enterprise,
and yet so powerful

158
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,200
that no one's brave enough to tell him
he's wearing a very silly hat.

159
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,040
And now, this.

160
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,160
And now, newscasters
finding the fact

161
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,080
they don't know words
hilarious.

162
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,760
For the second straight year,

163
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,720
the Scripps National Spelling
Bee has co-champions.

164
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,520
Spelling words none of us
have ever heard of.

165
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,440
I can't even say the final word.
Scherenschnitte.

166
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,840
"Scherenschnite."
Bless you.

167
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Scheren... schnitty.
Scherenschnitty.

168
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,400
I've got some schnerenschnit
over here for lunch.

169
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,440
Nunatak. N-U-N-A-T-A-K.
Nunatak.

170
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,360
Nunatak ! Noonatak. Noonatak.
Noonattack.

171
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,200
- That was a nun attack.
- What's the word ?

172
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,920
I can tell you that much.

173
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Nunnintek. I apologize if I'm not
pronouncing them right

174
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,880
'cause I couldn't even
begin to tell you what it...

175
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,960
Well, I know what it means.

176
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,200
It means a hill or a mountain
surrounded by glacial ice.

177
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,920
But I know that because
my producers told me.

178
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,520
But did you know it
right away ?

179
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,720
Yeah, obviously.

180
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,800
Thug
Life

181
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,720
It's the motherfucking
D-O-double G

182
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,880
Snoop Dogg !

183
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,560
Moving on, our main story
tonight is FIFA.

184
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,560
The organization that sounds
the most like the name of a purse dog.

185
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,840
"It's not 'Fifi,'
it's 'Fifa.'"

186
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,360
You may remember last year

187
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,280
we examined what an appalling
organization FIFA is,

188
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,840
treating countries that host
the World Cup like cash machines,

189
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,320
practically imposing
their own rule of law,

190
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,560
generating billions
of dollars, and yet,

191
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,880
somehow remaining
a nonprofit.

192
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,880
Despite being almost the dictionary
definition of corruption,

193
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,920
they've escaped any
significant prosecution for decades.

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,920
But that all ended
on Wednesday.

195
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,920
High-ranking officials
from FIFA,

196
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,720
the sport's governing body, arrested
in an overnight raid in Switzerland,

197
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,840
the result of
a sweeping FBI investigation.

198
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,880
I don't know what I'm more
surprised by,

199
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,880
that FIFA officials
were actually arrested

200
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,680
or that America was behind it.

201
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,280
It took the country that cares
the least about football

202
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,680
to bring down the people
who have been ruining it.

203
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,120
That's like finding out that Kesha
arrested a group of bankers

204
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,040
involved in commodities fraud.

205
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,880
Wow, Kesha. I actually did not think
this was an interest of yours.

206
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,280
But you've been
undeniably effective.

207
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,480
Tenacious prosecution, K.

208
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,200
It's not just the fact of the arrests
that was spectacular,

209
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,920
it's how they were
carried out.

210
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,840
We saw several of those FIFA officials
led from the hotel,

211
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,000
I think it was the hotel staff
trying to protect their appearance,

212
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,440
if not their dignity,
with white hotel sheets.

213
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,960
That is perfect.

214
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,040
Because hotel sheets are very
much like FIFA officials.

215
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,880
They really should be clean, but
they're actually unspeakably filthy,

216
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,920
and deep down
everybody knows that.

217
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,160
Essentially, the U.S. government
has accused FIFA officials

218
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,920
of soliciting $150 million
in bribes and kickbacks,

219
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,240
in forms ranging

220
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,880
from cash in a briefcase
to an expensive painting,

221
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,320
which, to be fair,
is unexpectedly classy corruption

222
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,600
for sports executives.

223
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,800
'Cause if you wanted
to bribe Roger Goodell,

224
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,920
all you'd need is a cardboard box
filled with old "Playboys."

225
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,680
Apparently,
the big breakthrough came

226
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,120
when the IRS caught
Chuck Blazer,

227
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,320
a corrupt American
FIFA official and actual bad Santa.

228
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,600
For many years, Blazer
didn't even file a tax return,

229
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,000
which was a little suspicious
considering the lifestyle he lived.

230
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,560
His criminal activity
financed an opulent lifestyle,

231
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,880
that included a luxury apartment
in New York's Trump Tower

232
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,880
for the use of his cats.

233
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,360
Wow !

234
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,040
None of us know what
aloof really means

235
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,800
until we meet a cat that has
its own apartment in Trump Tower.

236
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,720
He probably doesn't
even lick himself.

237
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,800
He just uses the
on-site dry cleaning.

238
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,880
Now, Blazer became
an FBI informant,

239
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,160
and with his help the U.S. government
managed to produce

240
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,440
a 164-page indictment which I genuinely
recommend that you read

241
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,600
because it's amazing.

242
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,600
Let me give you just a taste.
For instance,

243
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,680
it alleges that former FIFA
vice president Jack Warner

244
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,440
tried to help buy votes with envelopes
containing $40,000 in cash.

245
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,480
And when someone objected,
he said,

246
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,680
"If you're pious,
open a church, friends.

247
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,880
"Our business
is our business."

248
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,880
Which is not just awful,
it's factually incorrect.

249
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,280
Because opening a church

250
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,920
is a fantastic way to
make a shit ton of money.

251
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,760
That's just a fact.
And...

252
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,880
If you need any more proof
that Jack Warner

253
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,800
could not give less of a fuck,
listen to this.

254
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,920
After he was arrested, he left jail
in an ambulance claiming exhaustion.

255
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,760
Exhaustion that he then recovered from
miraculously quickly.

256
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,800
Hours after he was released
from jail,

257
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,040
the former FIFA exec turned politician
was defiant

258
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,360
as he addressed a rally.

259
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,560
Every little thing
is gonna be all right

260
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,920
That is cocky.

261
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,320
Denying any involvement

262
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,560
while singing "Every little
thing's gonna be all right."

263
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,280
As songs go,
that's a little on the nose.

264
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,760
I guess we're just lucky
that he didn't go

265
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,920
with "Got Your Money"
by Ol' Dirty Bastard.

266
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,320
Which, come to think of it,

267
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,000
are three words that describe
Jack Warner perfectly.

268
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,880
But the cherry on top
of all of this

269
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,360
was a video Jack Warner
released just today,

270
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,880
where he suggested that this
arrest was all a conspiracy,

271
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,640
brining hard proof
in the form of a newspaper article

272
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,200
stating that FIFA was trying
to placate the U.S.

273
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,880
by giving them
an extra World Cup this year.

274
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,320
FIFA has frantically announced

275
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,600
2015, 2015, this year,

276
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,520
this year, Olympic final

277
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,280
in the World Cup
beginning May 27.

278
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,320
If the FIFA is so bad,

279
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,480
why is it the USA wants
to keep the FIFA World Cup ?

280
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,360
And let's be fair, he's right.

281
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,160
FIFA giving the U.S. an extra World Cup
is comically ridiculous.

282
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,400
It's the sort of thing you'd usually
see in an "Onion" article.

283
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,840
Which it turns out was exactly
what he was holding up there.

284
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,360
And it says something

285
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,400
about how corrupt FIFA is
that one of their ex-vice presidents

286
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,760
could look at that story
and think, "Yeah.

287
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,040
"That sounds like something
they might do. Yeah. Yeah."

288
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,320
But maybe the most remarkable
thing about all of the charges

289
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,880
is that they didn't
touch Sepp Blatter,

290
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,560
who's been President of FIFA
for the last 17 years.

291
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,560
Now, on his watch, the World Cup
has left a trail of devastation.

292
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,280
Just last year, Brazil spent
billions of dollars

293
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,120
on massive new stadiums
to host the World Cup.

294
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,280
Stadiums which have met
a predictable fate.

295
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,840
These days there's very
little football being played

296
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,560
at the world's second most
expensive stadium.

297
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,680
In fact, it mostly sits empty.

298
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,880
After hosting less than
a handful of matches

299
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,640
during last year's World Cup,
it's never been filled again.

300
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,600
Today, it serves mainly
as a parking lot for these buses.

301
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,920
You have to give them credit.

302
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,480
FIFA literally
went into Brazil,

303
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,720
paved paradise
and put up a parking lot.

304
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,880
But that is just
a drop in the ocean

305
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,160
of what has happened
on Blatter's watch.

306
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,600
Just look at what's
gonna happen next Saturday,

307
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,600
when the Women's
World Cup starts.

308
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,920
Blatter has previously suggested

309
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,480
raising the popularity
of women's soccer

310
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,880
by saying, "They could,
for example, have tighter shorts.

311
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,920
"Female players are pretty."

312
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,080
And it is rare to find
a non-fired boss

313
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,880
who will openly say,
"I would like to make it easier

314
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,800
"for me to masturbate
to my employees."

315
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,920
And as you'll see next week,
that is pretty much the full extent

316
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,680
of Blatter's care
for female players' legs.

317
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,880
Every game will be played,
for the first time in history,

318
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,880
on artificial turf.

319
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,480
Many U.S. team members
are livid.

320
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,360
It is a gender equality issue.

321
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,920
No chance would the men
ever play a World Cup on turf.

322
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,440
Leroux recently posted
pictures of skin burns

323
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,560
she says were caused
by turf.

324
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,640
Holy shit !

325
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,720
The last time an athlete's
legs were beaten up that badly

326
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,360
in advance of
a major competition,

327
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,280
it was because Tonya Harding
was unwilling to settle for silver.

328
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,920
But no decision
Blatter has overseen

329
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
is more questionable than the 2022
World Cup being awarded to Qatar.

330
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,320
Because not only will the conditions
be terrible to play in,

331
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,080
but the number of migrant
workers that have died in Qatar

332
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,040
since the Cup was announced
has been staggering.

333
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,120
Now, the numbers are difficult
to pin down.

334
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,040
But a report by the International Trade
Union Confederation,

335
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,040
for example, has estimated
1,200 deaths so far,

336
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,720
with up to 4,000 additional
worker deaths by 2022.

337
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,720
Now, even if all those are not
directly related to the World Cup,

338
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,040
those are still
natural disaster numbers.

339
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,920
Weather services should start
issuing FIFA warnings.

340
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,560
"A stadium is being planned
in your area. Evacuate immediately."

341
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,480
And you would think all this might cost
Sepp Blatter his job.

342
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,880
And on Friday, he was actually
up for reelection as FIFA's president,

343
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,280
and offered a pretty terrible
defense for himself.

344
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,520
I know many people hold me

345
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,600
ultimately responsible
for the actions

346
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,440
and reputation
of the global football community.

347
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,560
We, or I,

348
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,320
cannot monitor everyone
all of the time.

349
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,720
That is weak.

350
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,880
You are basically
Charles Manson saying,

351
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,200
"Listen, I've got
a big family.

352
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,920
"I don't know what Squeaky
gets up to half the time."

353
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,760
And by this point, having learned
what you know about FIFA,

354
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,680
you have no right to be surprised
by the results of Friday's election.

355
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,040
With all eyes on FIFA, the most
powerful man in football, Sepp Blatter,

356
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,800
has won a fifth term
as president of that organization.

357
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,800
Come on ! He presided
over the worst fiasco in their history.

358
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,560
It's like a Sony executive
greenlighting a sequel

359
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,000
in the middle of
watching "Aloha."

360
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:58,280
"This is absolutely terrible, and I
need to make sure there's more of it.

361
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,560
"We'll call it 'Aloha 2:

362
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,920
"This Time We Mean
The Other Meaning.'"

363
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,880
Blatter's reelection

364
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,080
was absolutely
a foregone conclusion.

365
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,040
Everyone knew this was coming.

366
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,440
And I can explain why.

367
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,560
All 209 members in FIFA
get a single vote for president.

368
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,400
And a lot of those smaller members
have a financial interest

369
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,800
in keeping things
exactly as they are.

370
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,080
All share equally the profits
from the World Cup,

371
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,560
regardless of size
or soccer prowess.

372
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,960
Liechtenstein gets
as much money as Germany.

373
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,760
Andorra gets as much money
as Spain.

374
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,600
And Montserrat gets
as much money as United States.

375
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:42,160
That's right. The U.S.
gets the same share as Montserrat,

376
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,400
which A, isn't even a country,

377
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,080
and B, has a population
of less than 6,000.

378
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,120
So America, a country with
a population of 320 million,

379
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,960
gets just as much as an island
with a head count

380
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,920
matching that of a slightly
overbooked Caribbean cruise.

381
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,920
And that's why under FIFA's system,
leadership never changes.

382
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,200
Their elections are
such a joke

383
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,920
that four years ago
Blatter ran unopposed.

384
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,560
This was the actual
ballot paper from that year.

385
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,480
And they should at least have added
a second box so that your options were

386
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,320
"vote Blatter"
or "go fuck yourself."

387
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,440
And the problem is all
the arrests in the world

388
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,880
are gonna change nothing
as long as Blatter is still there.

389
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,880
Because to truly kill a snake
you must cut off its head.

390
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,760
Or in this case,
its asshole.

391
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,360
But if America keeps
driving this investigation...

392
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,240
This is important.

393
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,000
If America keeps driving
this investigation,

394
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,120
and actually finds something
to indict him,

395
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,920
I don't think you understand how much
that would mean to everyone on earth.

396
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,160
The whole world's opinion
of America would change overnight.

397
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,600
Let me put this in terms
you might understand.

398
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,040
If the Dutch somehow found a reason
to extradite and lock up Donald Trump,

399
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,160
you would think, "Holy shit !
The Dutch are awesome !

400
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,880
"The Dutch are...
What a country !"

401
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,600
That is what is on the table
for you, America.

402
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,480
And if you won't do it,
the last hope to get rid of him

403
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,880
is in the hands
of the only group

404
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,320
even more powerful
than world governments.

405
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,920
Right now, he's being backed
because the money's still flowing in.

406
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,680
The second Nike says goodbye,
or the second Visa says goodbye,

407
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,320
or Adidas or Coca-Cola
or Budweiser,

408
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,600
I guarantee you, FIFA will not,
the heads of FIFA

409
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,520
will not have the support
they currently enjoy.

410
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,760
Exactly.
Barring an indictment,

411
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,560
the only people with the power
to get rid of Sepp Blatter

412
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,880
are FIFA's sponsors.
These companies.

413
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,760
And I would like to make
a plea to them tonight.

414
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,520
Please, make Sepp Blatter
go away.

415
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,040
I will do anything. Adidas,
I'll wear one of your ugly shoes.

416
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,760
One of these shoes

417
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,880
that make me look like
the Greek god of aspiring DJs.

418
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,440
McDonald's, I will take a bite

419
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,400
out of every item
on your dollar menu.

420
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,480
Which tastes like normal food
that was cursed by a vindictive wizard.

421
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,200
And I will even make
the ultimate sacrifice.

422
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,520
Budweiser,
if you pull your support

423
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,120
and help get rid of Blatter,

424
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,760
I will put my mouth
where my mouth is

425
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,360
and I will personally drink
one of your disgusting items.

426
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,880
I'm serious.
It can be a Bud Light.

427
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,800
I will even drink
a Bud Light Lime.

428
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,080
Despite the fact
that all the lime in the world

429
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,800
cannot disguise the fact
that this tastes like a puddle

430
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,680
beneath a Long John Silver's
Dumpster.

431
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,520
But I will do it.
I will drink one,

432
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,800
maintaining eye contact
with the camera,

433
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,440
and I will say
it was delicious.

434
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,160
Because if you get rid
of the Swiss demon

435
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,000
who has ruined
the sport I love,

436
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,960
this stuff will taste
like fucking champagne.

437
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,400
And now, this...

438
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,880
And now,

439
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,160
Bernie Sanders
asks interviewers questions.

440
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,720
Do you know what youth
unemployment is today ?

441
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,840
No.

442
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,560
- What the average contribution was ?
- What was it ?

443
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,240
- What the unemployment rate there is ?
- Extremely high.

444
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,440
Do you know how much it costs to go
to college in Denmark ? Do you know ?

445
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,560
What their agenda is ?
What they believe in ?

446
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,840
Do you know how the VA
was processing claims ?

447
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,480
Do you know how many factories
we have lost in the last ten years ?

448
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,040
Do you know what's going on
in Nicaragua ? In Panama ?

449
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,880
Do you know what
the bottom 60 percent own ?

450
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,080
Do you know what
the bad news is ?

451
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,680
Do you know what you
have to do ? Do you know what ?

452
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,000
You know what ?
Well, you know what ?

453
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,200
You know what ? I got a pain
in my stomach and I'm worried.

454
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,080
AND NOW

455
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,160
And finally tonight, Hitler.

456
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,160
Or as I prefer to call him,
Mr. Eva Braun.

457
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,720
Hashtag "feminism,"
hashtag "Hitler."

458
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,000
Hitler died 70 years ago
last month.

459
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,560
Which is apparently
long enough

460
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,720
for some countries to get away
with TV shows like this.

461
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,080
A new Czech Republic TV show

462
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,880
has pushed
the reality TV genre

463
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,000
even closer to the edge
of good taste,

464
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,040
with a new Nazi-themed show
called "Holiday in the Protectorate."

465
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,920
The premise is simple:
three generations of one family

466
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,760
are placed in a situation,
of a mock Nazi-occupied Europe.

467
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,040
If they make it through
two months, they get 50 grand.

468
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,920
That begs
so many questions.

469
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,080
Not the least of which is
what happens if they don't win ?

470
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,880
What does losing entail
on that show ? Because in 1939,

471
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,440
the stakes
were pretty fucking high.

472
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,880
Now, you might think that that is
the most casual use of Nazi history

473
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,480
you can possibly imagine.
But there's actually been something

474
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,560
that we've been wanting
to show to you for a while.

475
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,800
A couple of months ago, we were
researching a story and stumbled across

476
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,880
a propaganda video produced
by the Thai government

477
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,840
designed to teach the core
values of Thai society.

478
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:48,400
Just keep an eye out
for what one child is painting.

479
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,400
Yes. That is a child applauding
their friend's Hitler painting.

480
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,880
Which is obviously offensive.
You don't applaud art when you like it.

481
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,560
You nod thoughtfully
and drink your weight

482
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,920
in complimentary
gallery Chardonnay.

483
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,480
Now, we naturally assumed
this was just a one-off aberration.

484
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,080
But it turns out Thailand

485
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,600
has something of a bizarre fixation
with Hitler imagery.

486
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,360
Thailand's biggest university

487
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,960
apologizing today for a
controversial mural.

488
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,920
Take a look at the artwork.

489
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,760
It's depicting Adolf Hitler
in a group of superheroes.

490
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,240
A Christian school in Thailand
now apologizing

491
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,880
for allowing students to march
in a Nazi-themed parade.

492
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,120
The Hitler chicken restaurant

493
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,560
is using the image
of the Nazi leader

494
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,840
on an emblem similar to KFC.

495
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,640
KFC calls it
extremely distasteful.

496
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,360
That's right. KFC, the makers
of the chicken scraps

497
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,000
and potato mélange
you drink from a cup,

498
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,160
called something
extremely distasteful,

499
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,480
and were not
being hypocritical.

500
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,000
Now, to be fair,
in Thai schools,

501
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,320
"world history
is not given much attention,

502
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,880
"with little or no mention
of the Holocaust."

503
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,480
Although to be even fairer,
come on !

504
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,560
How is it appropriate
to use Hitler on a billboard

505
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,200
to advertise a wax museum,
or to advertise a herbal laxative tea

506
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,600
with Hitler proclaiming,
"Release the demon."

507
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,360
That doesn't even make sense,
Thailand.

508
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,880
If you had Hitler screaming
at you to take a shit,

509
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,400
I'm pretty sure you wouldn't
need a fucking laxative.

510
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,880
And we haven't even got into
the clothing available in Thailand yet.

511
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,880
You can buy t-shirts featuring
panda Hitlers,

512
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,400
and Teletubby Hitlers.

513
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,920
Who is that last one for ?

514
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,720
There are two types of people who would
wear Hitler Teletubby clothing.

515
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,000
The type that want
a Teletubby shirt so badly

516
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,680
they'll take one with Hitler on it,

517
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,000
and the type who want
a Hitler shirt so badly

518
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,880
they'll take one
with a Teletubby on it.

519
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,320
And I'm not sure
who the worse person is there.

520
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,920
But the greatest example

521
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,920
of just how comfortable
Thailand is with Hitler imagery

522
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,240
is the fact that a Thai band
called "Slur" once produced this video.

523
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,760
That is misjudged just
from a marketing standpoint.

524
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,880
How are teenage girls supposed
to pick a favorite boy band member

525
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,880
if all of them
are the bad boy ?

526
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,600
Look, look, Thailand,
you need to understand

527
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,880
the only acceptable
depictions of Hitler

528
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,640
are either in a history textbook

529
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,280
or accidentally
on a dog's face.

530
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,160
That's the only time.

531
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,240
Who's a bad boy ? You are.

532
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,640
You're a very bad boy.

533
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,600
But to embrace the actual Hitler
is a real problem.

534
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,360
He was terrible.
Google Hitler right now, Thailand,

535
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,760
and see what comes up.
Seriously, do it now. We will all wait.

536
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,560
PLEASE STAND BY
WHILE THAILAND GOOGLES HITLER

537
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,520
Yes. Exactly, Thailand.
He was really bad.

538
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,480
Look, this has to stop.

539
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
'Cause if you need

540
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,360
a charismatic personality with
a funny mustache to worship,

541
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,720
there are other options.
In fact, there's a perfect option.

542
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,920
And I'm talking about beloved
comedian and TV personality Rip Taylor.

543
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,200
He's got everything
you're looking for, Thailand.

544
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,880
Funny mustache, check.
Colorful outfits, big check.

545
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,880
What about a flair
for pageantry ?

546
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,120
Rip Taylor,
ladies and gentlemen.

547
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,400
I don't understand
what the hell they're doing !

548
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,800
I mean, it looks more like
a riptide to me !

549
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,880
Sure, it's no Nuremberg Rally,
but come on.

550
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,680
It's pretty close.

551
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,360
And the beauty is Rip Taylor
is more than willing

552
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,880
to be the new face of whatever you want
in Thailand.

553
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,760
Don't take my word for it.
Tell them, Rip.

554
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,720
Thailand, I would love
to be your substitute Hitler !

555
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,880
I would love to be your
substitute Hitler !

556
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,320
Put Rip Taylor
on whatever you want.

557
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,840
Murals and walls and t-shirts
and chicken restaurants

558
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,880
and dress up your boy bands
as me ! Seriously !

559
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,560
Come on, do it.
Don't just sit there, do it !

560
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,600
See ? He'll do it !
And guess what ?

561
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:11,040
Rip Taylor has
never killed six million Jews.

562
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,120
Tell them, Rip.

563
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,880
Rip's never killed
a single Jew !

564
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,040
Not a single one ! Seriously !

565
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,240
No Jews. Never. Never.
It's not my nature.

566
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,880
Exactly ! And to be honest,
that's a relief,

567
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,280
'cause I did not check that
before asking him.

568
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,640
But the point is it's true,
so come on, Thailand.

569
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,400
'Cause if anything,
your laxative teas

570
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,840
are about to get
even better commercials.

571
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,000
That's our show,
our huge thanks to Rip Taylor.

572
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,080
Please join us next week !

573
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,760
Good night !

574
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,080
Wanna know the difference
between this show and my toupée ?

575
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:45,120
My toupée is more likely
to stay on.

576
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,920
Good night, America ! Hope you learned
about politics ! I did !

577
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,560
