00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,320
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
with John Oliver

2
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,240
EPISODE 23

3
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,840
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to Last Week Tonight !

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,640
I'm John Oliver. Thank you so much
for joining us.

5
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,000
Just time for a quick recap
of this week,

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,080
and we begin in Afghanistan.

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,320
It's the just the tip
of international conflicts.

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,120
We jumped in too fast,

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,840
went in further
than we originally intended,

10
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,320
and now we're pulling out
way more slowly

11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,160
than we said we would.

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,840
Peace talks were supposed
to take place this week

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,040
between the Taliban
and the Afghan government,

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,520
but, on Wednesday,
there was a big development.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,400
Breaking news out of Afghanistan, right
now. The government there says

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,560
that Taliban leader
Mullah Mohammed Omar is dead.

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,640
Okay. Well, that's...

18
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,680
that's probably going
to affect those talks then.

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,040
The Taliban has lost its key figure,
and that's going to be difficult.

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,200
It's not unlike when "Two
and a Half Men" lost Charlie Sheen.

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,600
Yes, yes,
the guy was a nightmare,

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,760
but he was undeniably the figurehead
of the whole terrible enterprise.

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,000
Now, the US knew surprisingly little
about Mullah Omar.

24
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,720
In fact, this was the government's
wanted poster,

25
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,880
featuring vivid descriptions like
Hair: Black,

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,240
Nationality: Afghan,
and Height: Tall,

27
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,520
which is pretty nonspecific.

28
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,680
If you're a basketball player,
tall is seven feet.

29
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,720
but if you're writing
your own profile on OkCupid,

30
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,480
it can mean 5 foot 6.

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,160
There's...
There's a discrepancy there.

32
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,560
It had actually been a while since
we had seen Mullah Omar,

33
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,000
although, as we found out
later this week,

34
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,000
there was actually a pretty
good explanation for that.

35
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,000
Afghan officials said today,
Mullah Omar died of hepatitis in 2013,

36
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,920
but his death was kept secret by the
Taliban for more than two years.

37
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,640
Yeah, it turns out
he's been dead for two years,

38
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,720
and the Taliban simply
hadn't mentioned it.

39
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,400
I don't know why.Maybe they were trying
to break it to their members gently.

40
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,440
Oh, Mullah Omar ?
He's fine.

41
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,360
He's living
on a farm upstate

42
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,920
where he can run and play with
all the other Taliban leaders

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,200
that you haven't seen
for a while.

44
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,040
He's so happy.
You'll see him soon.

45
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,600
This actually put the Taliban, though,
in something of an awkward position,

46
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,040
because they were still
releasing statements from him

47
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,040
as recently
as two weeks ago.

48
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,000
They've essentially been full-on
Weekend at Bernie's-ing him

49
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,680
for the last two years.

50
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,760
In fact, so much so,

51
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,760
that, in April, they even
published his biography,

52
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,920
saying, among other things,
that he...

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,880
"does not own a home and has
no foreign bank accounts"

54
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,680
and "Mullah Omar is tranquil
and does not lose his temper"...

55
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,440
...which, I guess,
was technically true.

56
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,280
Although, it would also have been fair
to say he's on a disciplined diet

57
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,280
and has been spending
a lot of time in his garden.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,400
But the point is,

59
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,000
by the end of the week,

60
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,640
the game was clearly up and the
Taliban announced a new leader,

61
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,640
although details seemed
a little light.

62
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,400
The new leader is Mullah
Akhtar Mohammad Mansour.

63
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,760
He has been the Taliban's
second in command

64
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,920
and deputy leader since 2010.
He was formerly the militant group's

65
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,040
minister of civil aviation
and transportation.

66
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,760
Wait, wait.

67
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,760
They went with the former
transportation minister ?

68
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,400
That would be like
if President Obama's successor

69
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,720
were our current transportation
secretary, Evelyn Sargent.

70
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,120
By the way, that's a stock photo
of a woman we found online,

71
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,680
and Evelyn Sargent is
a made-up name.

72
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,440
The point is, you don't know who
the secretary of transportation is.

73
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,520
Nobody does, because they're
not supposed to be in line

74
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,600
for the top job
in any organization !

75
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,840
Also, I have to say that's
not a lot of information to go on.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,440
Even the photo
of him is blurry.

77
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,360
So, frankly,
I dread to think

78
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,480
what the new government profile
on him is going to look like.

79
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,360
Hair: Black. Height: Yes.
Face: Probably.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,280
Ears: Between 0 and 2.

81
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,360
So, let's move on to some good
news out of Chechnya...

82
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,280
a sentence uttered
almost as infrequently

83
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,320
as, Man, I hope I get seated
next to a baby.

84
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,560
Chechnya delivered
a very unusual victory

85
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,840
in the war on terror
this week.

86
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,680
Three young Chechen women
have apparently had

87
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,840
more success battling ISIL
than some fighting forces.

88
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,680
They swindled ISIL fighters
out of thousands of dollars.

89
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,560
The trio made the fighters think
they would be their brides.

90
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,040
The plot went like this:

91
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,560
The girls would meet
ISIL recruiters online,

92
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,000
but tell them they had no money
to travel from Chechnya to Syria.

93
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,640
That's when ISIL would offer
to send them the funds.

94
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,920
Holy shit,
they catfished ISIS !

95
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,400
They catfished ISIS !

96
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,000
And it just goes to show...
forget the CIA...

97
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,320
there are no more intimidating
PSYOPS masterminds

98
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,000
in the world of warfare
than scheming teenage girls.

99
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,680
They will take you down !
They are mean !

100
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,680
The girls actually took in over 3000$,
before they got caught,

101
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,920
and the details are fantastic.

102
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,480
He tried to pull me in,
asking if I wanted

103
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,560
to come to Syria
and that I'd like it.

104
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,160
I said I had no money,
and he said he'd help.

105
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,400
The girls received the money,
but never traveled to Syria.

106
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,600
Instead, they blocked
the ISIL fighter

107
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,040
they were communicating with
and moved on to the next target.

108
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,720
Oh ! They just blocked him.

109
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,600
That is cold.

110
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,280
They didn't even send
one last message saying,

111
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,480
"Really busy, can't get into a thing
right now, but you are great.

112
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,760
It was fun talking to you !!"

113
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,760
They humiliated him so badly,

114
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,640
I can't believe I'm actually feeling
sorry for someone in ISIS.

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,680
So, afterwards, what's gonna happen
to these three Chechen girls ?

116
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,400
Are we talking a parade in their honor,
statues with pixelated faces ?

117
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,360
What's it gonna be ?

118
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,640
It's unclear, though,
whether they will receive

119
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,600
any punishment for the scam.

120
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,200
Punishment ?

121
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,000
You can't punish these girls.

122
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,200
Scamming ISIS is the best thing
anyone did on Earth this week.

123
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,280
It's basically
the exact opposite

124
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,040
of shooting a lion
with a bow and arrow.

125
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,040
These three girls are
the anti-dentist !

126
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,280
They must be celebrated !
We must honor them !

127
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,080
So, finally...
finally, this week,

128
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,040
the United Kingdom...
America's before photo.

129
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,880
Britain...
Britain found itself

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,200
in a Parliamentary
scandal this week

131
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,280
after The Sun newspaper
released a bombshell video.

132
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,880
The British lawmaker
has quit Parliament

133
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,560
in the wake of a drug
and prostitution scandal.

134
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,960
Lord Sewel is facing
a criminal investigation

135
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
after a video came out
this weekend

136
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,760
purportedly showing him
taking drugs with prostitutes.

137
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,600
That's him, snorting
what looks like cocaine

138
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,840
with a couple of prostitutes.

139
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,160
Lounging in the prostitute's bra,
the 69-year-old married father

140
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,440
brags about having more
than a dozen marital affairs.

141
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,840
Okay, okay, okay,

142
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,320
there's obviously
a lot to unpack there...

143
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,960
the cocaine,
the prostitutes,

144
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,960
the orange bra,
which somehow seems to be

145
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,960
a perfect fit for
a 69-year-old married father.

146
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,240
I'm not saying what he did was right.
I'm saying he knows his own body,

147
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,800
good for him.

148
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,680
Now... Now, Lord Sewel...

149
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,240
seen here dressed as Jeffrey Dahmer,
dressed as Santa Claus...

150
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,240
was forced to resign

151
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,560
as deputy speaker
of the House of Lords

152
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,400
after The Sun's video was released.
And it wasn't just what he was doing

153
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,320
in the video that was controversial.
It's what he was saying.

154
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,840
We could but do with
some nice little young Asian lady

155
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,600
I would have thouht tonight,
but never mind.

156
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,880
They sort of look innocent
but you know they are whores.

157
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,160
Okay, okay, okay.

158
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,680
Ignoring the obvious racism
and sexism for a moment,

159
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,640
I'll say this
for Lord Sewel...

160
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,440
We could have done with a nice
Asian lady, but never mind,

161
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,640
is an incredibly polite way

162
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,440
of registering a complaint
at a coke-fueled orgy.

163
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,080
The guy has manners,

164
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,560
but, as we learned
elsewhere in the footage,

165
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,840
Lord Sewel is nothing
if not spectacularly polite.

166
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,920
So you want to get some coke ?
Well, I mean...

167
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,560
- If people would enjoy a little.
- Yeah.

168
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,240
No one enjoys
cocaine a little.

169
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,000
Cocaine is like ISIS
or Insane Clown Posse.

170
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,600
It's not for everyone,
but the people who like it

171
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,320
like it to
a life-destroying extent.

172
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,680
Call your parents, Sean. They don't
know what's happening to you.

173
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,800
And look, look, we don't
have time, I'm afraid,

174
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,200
to get into every aspect
of this video,

175
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,840
such as the fact that Sewel snorted
cocaine through a 5 pound note,

176
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,000
meaning the cocaine had
to traverse the queen's face

177
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,640
en route to his nose,

178
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,440
or that he reportedly...

179
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,160
insisted on turning a framed photo
of his wife face-down on a table

180
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,040
...before snorting cocaine
off the prostitute's...

181
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,960
and I'm quoting
the tabloids here... "boobs".

182
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,280
And it's a good thing he did,

183
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,840
otherwise, he would've
heard his wife's nagging voice

184
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,240
in his head the whole time. "You're
spilling cocaine everywhere, dear.

185
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,480
There's an extra bit
you missed on the boob.

186
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,240
Waste not, want not."

187
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,800
Now, until he resigned,

188
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,760
there was one more
glorious tidbit.

189
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,640
The Telegraph reports
that he could become

190
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,640
the first peer to be expelled
from the House

191
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,680
under new rules that
he helped put in place.

192
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,200
He wrote the rules !

193
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,040
The only way this could be
any more ironic

194
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,000
is if he wrote them on the back
of a picture of his wife,

195
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,040
which he then rolled up to snort
cocaine off a prostitute's boob.

196
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,200
It's just so great !

197
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,320
Now, let me give you some quick
context on the House of Lords itself,

198
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,680
because it's perhaps
even stupider than this story.

199
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,400
It consists of nearly
800 members,

200
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,080
almost all of whom got lifetime
appointments from prime ministers,

201
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,000
who meet to review laws
passed by the House of Commons

202
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,480
in a room so gaudy,
it looks like the tomb

203
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,920
Liberace's dog was buried in.

204
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,960
These are, by definition,
a privileged group,

205
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,240
as you can tell
from their ridiculous titles,

206
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,280
such as...
and these are all real...

207
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,960
the Lord Ponsonby
of Shulbrede

208
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,240
and Baron Soulsby
of Swaffham Prior.

209
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,120
And yet, they can
claim a daily allowance

210
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,920
for attendance and travel
from the taxpayer,

211
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,400
something that sticks
in your throat a bit.

212
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,640
In fact,
one of Lord Sewel's guests

213
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,240
actually asked him
about this in the video.

214
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,480
200 a day ?

215
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,240
200 a day to buy lunch ?

216
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,520
It is not lunch, lovie darling.
It is paying for this.

217
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,520
This guy is incredible !

218
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,480
Oh, don't worry,
lovie darling.

219
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,600
I'm not wasting
that money on lunch.

220
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,600
I'm wasting it on cocaine,
and, as I said before,

221
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,200
insufficiently Asian whores.

222
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,600
And look... the point...
this is just the latest

223
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,640
in a long line of scandals
involving the House of Lords,

224
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,040
and yet significant reform still
doesn't seem to be on the cards,

225
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,720
which is crazy.

226
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,400
Britain spends a lot of money
on the House of Lords

227
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,240
and gets
virtually nothing back.

228
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,720
And frankly, maybe they should take
a lesson from America here,

229
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,680
because when this country
subsidizes the lifestyle

230
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,360
of a horny,
casually racist asshole,

231
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,840
at least we all get four
"Lethal Weapon" movies out of it.

232
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,480
And now this.

233
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,880
And now...

234
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,600
Ten actual titles of current members
of the British House of Lords

235
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,520
paired with photos of pets who look
like they would have that name

236
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,080
The Lord Wrigglesworth,

237
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,920
The Lord Phillips
of Worth Matravers,

238
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,040
The Baroness Young
of Old Scone,

239
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,040
The Lord Hennessy
of Nympsfield,

240
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,160
The Baroness Farrington
of Ribbleton,

241
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,520
The Lord Marlesford,

242
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,080
The Baroness Kinnock
of Holyhead,

243
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,920
The Lord Griffiths
of Fforestfach,

244
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,720
The Baroness Liddell
of Coatdyke,

245
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,760
and The Lord Baker
of Dorking.

246
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,520
Moving on.
Moving on.

247
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,800
Our main story tonight
concerns America...

248
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,880
land of the free, home of the brave,
inventor of Chinese food.

249
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,880
Now, as you know, America
is made up of 50 states.

250
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,600
As a child, you may have been forced
to learn to sing them in order.

251
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,600
Alabama and Alaska

252
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,480
Arizona, Arkansas

253
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,280
California, Colorado

254
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,000
Connecticut and more

255
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,960
Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Maine

256
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,200
Maryland, Massachusetts,
and good old Michigan

257
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,120
Texas, and there's Utah,
Vermont, I'm almost through

258
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,360
Virginia, and there's Washington
And West Virginia, too

259
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,520
Could Wisconsin be
the last one or is it ?

260
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,800
No, Wyoming is the last one
in the states that rhyme

261
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,600
That is impressive, especially
because that is a difficult song.

262
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,880
The British version is a little
simpler. It goes like this.

263
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,280
England, Scotland,
Northern Ireland

264
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,680
Wales, and now
this song is done

265
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,320
And that's it. That's it.

266
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,920
To be fair, I will say

267
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,200
the song used
to be a lot longer.

268
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,520
But... But, of course,

269
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,920
50 states does not quite tell
the whole American story.

270
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,160
You might remember,
earlier this year,

271
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,360
we talked about US territories
like Puerto Rico and Guam,

272
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,400
but there is one other
US population

273
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,520
which suffers a lack
of representation in DC,

274
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,400
and that's DC itself.

275
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,760
If you've ever visited,
you've probably noticed

276
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,000
their license plates say Taxation
without representation.

277
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,160
And that's for
a pretty good reason.

278
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,040
Washington, DC, isn't like
your typical city in America.

279
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,600
Congress has the final say
over its budget and laws,

280
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,240
and DC does not have full
representation on the Hill.

281
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,760
The Chinese pandas
at the National Zoo

282
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,800
have as much right to
representation in the US Congress

283
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,680
as any resident
in the District of Columbia.

284
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,000
Okay, okay, but to be fair,
that is probably for the best.

285
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,640
We don't need
those pandas participating

286
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,440
in representative democracy.

287
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,560
We need them fucking,

288
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
and we need them
to fuck a lot,

289
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,040
so don't get squeamish
about this.

290
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,800
They're endangered.

291
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,560
The voting rights of Mei Xiang
and Tian Tian can wait.

292
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,440
Right now,
it's fuck o'clock,

293
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,560
you weird, biochromatic
raccoons on steroids.

294
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,600
Take a trip
to pound town, pronto.

295
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,320
But look,
you can understand

296
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,760
why many people
in DC are angry.

297
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,360
'Cause think about it. They pay
federal taxes, and fight in wars,

298
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,160
and yet, have no member of Congress
who is able to vote on their behalf,

299
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,920
even though their population is
larger than Vermont and Wyoming,

300
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,440
and their Gross Domestic Product
is higher than that of 16 states.

301
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,760
And if you're thinking,
Well, isn't this just how

302
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,560
countries treat their capitol cities ?
It actually isn't.

303
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,120
We're the only democracy
in the world that does this.

304
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,680
In fact, when the Dalai Lama
came to visit...

305
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,720
he wondered why a "small pocket"
of people living

306
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,000
in the world's champion
of democracy lacked full voting rights

307
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,440
...calling it...
"Quite strange, quite strange".

308
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,600
And it is not good
when a guy from Tibet says,

309
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,000
Wow. This situation
is really undemocratic.

310
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,840
Someone should do
something about it.

311
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,760
Does Richard Gere know about this ?
Someone should tell him.

312
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,040
Now, to be fair, DC does have
a member of Congress,

313
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,880
Eleanor Holmes Norton,

314
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,720
but there are some
strict limits on her powers.

315
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,240
I vote in committee,

316
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,200
but I cannot do that

317
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,880
which every American
would believe

318
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,680
is emblematic
of citizenship.

319
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,120
And that is vote
on the House floor...

320
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,880
vote on whether your taxes
go up or go down.

321
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,120
Vote on whether
you go to war or not.

322
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,520
Can't do that.

323
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,760
So, she basically
has pretend power,

324
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,280
like a child watching
Dora the Explorer.

325
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,760
Oh, yeah. Dora took her map
out of her backpack

326
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,680
because you told her to.

327
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,600
Just keep believing that,
you tiny idiot.

328
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,720
Just grow up.

329
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,680
And for more than two decades,

330
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
she's introduced
bill after bill

331
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,880
to grant DC either statehood
or a vote in Congress.

332
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,520
And, by the way, you do not want to
interrupt her while she's arguing for it

333
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,480
Someone tried
eight years ago,

334
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,880
and it did not work out
too well for them.

335
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,720
- Will the gentlewoman yield ?
- I will not yield, sir !

336
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,320
The District of Columbia
has spent 260 years yielding

337
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,200
to people who would
deny them the vote !

338
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,320
I yield you no ground !

339
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,560
Not during my time !

340
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,200
You have had your say,

341
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,920
and your say has been

342
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,960
that you think that the people
who live in your capitol

343
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,880
are not entitled to a vote
in their house !

344
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,600
Shame on you !

345
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,480
Yeah !

346
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,520
That is fantastic.

347
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,040
It's like Mr. Smith
Goes to Washington,

348
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,240
except she was already in Washington
and doesn't have the power

349
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,600
to do anything.

350
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,520
At this point,
it might be helpful

351
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,000
to just take a moment and explain
how DC got into this mess.

352
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,240
Back in the late 1700s, there was
no permanent US capitol,

353
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,280
it was just
wherever Congress met,

354
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,760
meaning it was
in eight different cities.

355
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,760
But after Congress was mobbed
by veterans demanding back pay

356
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,840
in the Pennsylvania
Mutiny of 1793,

357
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,520
they decided they needed an enclave
under their own control.

358
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,360
So, they added a clause
to the Constitution,

359
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,840
which said that Congress
shall have the power

360
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,280
to exercise exclusive legislation
in all cases whatsoever

361
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,120
over a federal district,

362
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,480
which is pretty
significant power.

363
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,080
As far as documents
demanding control go,

364
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,760
it's right up there
with the one Christian Grey

365
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,680
asked Anastasia Steele to sign
in "50 Shades of Grey",

366
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,760
before he... I don't know...
pinched her butt or whatever.

367
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,240
I haven't seen it
for obvious reasons.

368
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,480
Jamie Dornan was and remains
hashtag NotMyChristian.

369
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,600
But... But DC...

370
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,520
DC went under
federal control in 1801,

371
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,520
and it wasn't until the 1960s

372
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,760
that DC's then three-quarters
of a million citizens...

373
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,600
mostly African-American...

374
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,520
were given even the most basic
electoral rights.

375
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,880
Until 1964, residents could not even
vote in presidential elections.

376
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,360
It took a constitutional
amendment to bestow that right.

377
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,720
A few years later, Congress
granted limited home rule,

378
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,280
allowing DC voters to elect
a mayor and city council,

379
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,000
but required all legislation,
including the city's budget,

380
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,520
be subject
to congressional approval.

381
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,800
And with that level
of restriction,

382
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,000
the mayor of DC gets
to run the city

383
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,600
the way a student council president
gets to run her high school.

384
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,960
Oh, sure, Kelsey,
pick the theme for prom,

385
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,800
but we'll control the budget,
and 'Eyes Wide Shut'

386
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
is not an acceptable theme.

387
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,720
We are not having
a repeat of last year.

388
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,960
It was a mess, and it was
surprisingly boring.

389
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,400
Now, to be fair...

390
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,560
to be fair here, Congress very rarely
rejects DC's decisions outright,

391
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,160
which sounds good.

392
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,480
Unfortunately, instead
they attach so-called riders

393
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,640
to DC's appropriations bills,

394
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,800
stripping out funding for
things that they don't like.

395
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,200
And given that DC is a fairly liberal
and diverse city

396
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,680
and Congress is frequently
neither of those things,

397
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,360
over the years, Congress has
repeatedly stepped in

398
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,800
whenever DC is about to do something
that they might disapprove of.

399
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,960
For example,
just last November,

400
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,720
70% of Washingtonians
voted to legalize

401
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,480
possession of marijuana,

402
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,520
and DC's residents were
pretty excited about that.

403
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,880
This strain is a strain
called Mrs. Buttersworth.

404
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,680
- It is illegal, what you're doing now.
- Very much.

405
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,960
It won't be illegal
tomorrow, correct ?

406
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,200
That is correct.

407
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,040
What is that like, to come out
of the shadows, as it were ?

408
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,200
It's literally...
for me, literally...

409
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,840
coming out of the closet.

410
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,840
I can literally take my tent
out of this closet.

411
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,280
At... At long last,

412
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,120
my tent can come
out of its closet

413
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,840
and the hydroponic plant
inside it, can proudly say,

414
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,600
I'm here. My side effects
include drowsiness,

415
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,640
the desire to make claws out of
Bugles on your fingertips and fear.

416
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,880
Get used to it !
Get used to it !

417
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,480
'Cause I'm here
and I look good !

418
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,760
But then,
Republicans in Congress

419
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,680
stepped in and passed
a rider forbidding DC

420
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,200
from using their funds
to enact that law.

421
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,680
And if you're wondering how that
squares with the conservative ethos

422
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,080
of limited government
and states' rights,

423
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,960
well, here is how one of those
congressmen justified it.

424
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,760
Well, Washington, DC,
is not a state,

425
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,560
and Washington, DC,
has a lot to offer, but...

426
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,520
you know,

427
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,000
free reign on marijuana use ?

428
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,240
I just don't buy that.

429
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,280
I just don't think that that's
the way they should operate.

430
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,320
So, states' rights, yes, but
Washington, DC, is not a state.

431
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,200
You know you have
a weak argument

432
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,400
when you're clinging
to the precise wording you used.

433
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,160
Hey, I said I wouldn't fuck
any other women.

434
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,560
This is
my squash mate, Gary.

435
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,480
Having sex
with women, no,

436
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,640
but Gary is
not a woman.

437
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,120
You stay here, Gary.
Let her leave.

438
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,800
Now, DC managed
to find a loophole

439
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,520
that let them enact
that marijuana law anyway,

440
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,120
but other laws have
not been so lucky.

441
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,240
For nearly a decade, Congress
successfully blocked DC

442
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,840
from using its own tax dollars
to fund a needle exchange program

443
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,640
to battle the HIV epidemic.

444
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,880
And one of the men
responsible for that,

445
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,800
Georgia Representative
Bob Barr, explained why.

446
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,040
I would also remind
our colleagues

447
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,760
of a very basic principle.

448
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,400
If you give people the means
to do something

449
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,480
and encourage them to do it,

450
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,480
well, for heaven's sake,
no surprise, they will do it.

451
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,760
Okay, that is just ridiculous.

452
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,360
Because providing clean
needles to drug users

453
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,760
is not the same as putting out
a bowl of chips at a party.

454
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,440
No one sees a needle exchange
and thinks,

455
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,120
Well, I had no intention
of ever taking heroin,

456
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,880
but seeing as you've offered,
you know what ? Don't mind if I do.

457
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,080
How kind.
I don't want to be rude.

458
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,560
But it's a little hard

459
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,760
to hear him object to DC
funding needle exchanges

460
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,960
when you hear a little fact later
mentioned by one of his colleagues.

461
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,080
I trust that Mr. Barr
is aware

462
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,000
that Georgia has
a needle exchange program ?

463
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,080
Yes, Georgia had a needle
exchange program, too.

464
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,840
And what did Representative Barr
think that theirs was for ?

465
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,440
Injecting peach cobbler
intravenously ?

466
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,560
Oh, I couldn't eat
another bite,

467
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,320
but I sure as shit
ain't done yet.

468
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,320
Fill me up !

469
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,080
Let me ride
the peach, y'all.

470
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,240
Let me ride the peach !

471
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,600
And here's the thing. There were
consequences to that rider.

472
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,400
In the nine years that DC
was denied its needle exchanges,

473
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,200
more than 1500
injection-drug users

474
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,680
were diagnosed
with HIV in the District.

475
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,040
And interestingly, since DC finally
funded their needle exchanges in 2008,

476
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,840
HIV diagnosis linked
to injecting drugs

477
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:13,320
went down by 87%,
because of course they did.

478
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,760
Needle exchanges are always
preferable to the alternative.

479
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,600
Try and think of needles
as bridesmaid dresses.

480
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,640
Anyone who tells you
you can reuse them

481
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,840
does not have
your best interests at heart.

482
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,520
Just eat the 200$
and throw it away, Cheryl.

483
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,680
She screwed you.
She screwed all of the girls.

484
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,680
It seems that Congress
just forces riders on DC

485
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,080
whenever they disapprove of how
they're spending their own money.

486
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,880
They are treating more than 600.000
people right now like children.

487
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,280
And, in case you think
I'm exaggerating,

488
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,520
listen to Florida
Congressman John Mica

489
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,000
explain why DC should not get
full control over their budget.

490
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,160
Well, when my kids were
young teenagers,

491
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,040
they always wanted
budget autonomy, too.

492
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,320
You believe District Leaders are
children ? They're not ready ?

493
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,760
No, but they have matured.

494
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,240
We just don't want regression.

495
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,480
No, no, I'm not... No, no, no,
I'm not saying they're children.

496
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,680
But they can't be trusted with money
until they learn some responsibility,

497
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,040
and until then, we should
give them an allowance.

498
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,840
You know, now that I'm hearing it out
loud, I am calling them children.

499
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,120
That is absolutely what I'm doing.

500
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,440
But the award for the most
depressingly cynical thing

501
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,520
that has ever
been said about DC

502
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,840
actually goes
to our current president,

503
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,560
who, in 2011, avoided
a government shutdown

504
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,680
by striking a deal
with John Boehner

505
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,520
that included prohibiting DC
from spending its own money

506
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,520
on abortions
for low-income women,

507
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,160
saying, and I quote...

508
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:46,520
"John, I will give you D.C.
abortion. I am not happy about it..."

509
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,920
And the only time trading away
DC abortion would be acceptable

510
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,880
is if DC Abortion is
a rare 1950s comic book,

511
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,840
and you're getting Marvel's
The Amazing Mammogram in return.

512
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,200
That is it.

513
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,360
Otherwise,
that's not great.

514
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,040
Look, the people of DC clearly
deserve a greater voice

515
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,400
in their own affairs and they've
actually come tantalizingly close

516
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,200
to getting a voting
representative in Congress.

517
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,880
In 2009, a bill to give DC a vote was
introduced in the Senate,

518
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,720
and the Senate did the most
dickish thing imaginable...

519
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,840
passing it
but with a little addition.

520
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,120
Well, you know, they passed
a major hurdle today,

521
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,800
getting this DC voting rights
bill through the Senate

522
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,920
but not without a highly controversial
amendment attached to it.

523
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,600
This amendment would repeal
all of DC's gun-control laws.

524
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,600
Oh, she's not kidding.

525
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,520
That amendment
would've repealed

526
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,800
their ban
on semi-automatic weapons,

527
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,600
removed criminal penalties
for unregistered firearms,

528
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,360
and even altered their ability

529
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,800
to enact future
gun-control legislation.

530
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,320
It was the kind of amendment
NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre

531
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,880
dreams about as he sleeps
in his bullet-filled bathtub,

532
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,880
I presume.

533
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,640
As a result of that amendment,
the bill was dropped,

534
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,000
and DC has not been close
to getting a vote since.

535
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,040
And the problem is,
even if they eventually get one,

536
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,200
Congress could still add riders
to mess with DC's laws,

537
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,640
and that's why many
Washingtonians want full statehood.

538
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,440
But that's probably a long shot,
because last year,

539
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,840
Congress held its first hearing
on DC's statehood in 21 years,

540
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,400
and the turnout
was not encouraging.

541
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,640
The sad thing was,
only two members...

542
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,840
two senators of that committee
actually showed up

543
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,520
to listen to testimony today.

544
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,040
That's pathetic !

545
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,120
That's pathetic.
Yeah, it was.

546
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,560
Only two turned up.

547
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,200
That's not just a pathetic attendance
for a hearing on Capitol Hill.

548
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,960
That would be pathetic for
a one-year-old's birthday party.

549
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,760
Really, Mikey ?
Just your mom and dad ?

550
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,000
You haven't made
any other friends in an entire year ?

551
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,240
Put yourself
out there, Mikey !

552
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,920
The world is
waiting for you, Mikey.

553
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,360
And look, whether the fix
is a vote or statehood,

554
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,040
something has to happen.

555
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,120
The problem is inertia is
a really powerful force.

556
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,600
And opponents might say,
Well, we can't grant DC statehood.

557
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,600
We'd have to change
the Constitution,

558
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,040
but we could do that.

559
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,560
The whole point of amendments
is to fix things

560
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,560
that no longer make any sense.
It's happened 27 times and counting.

561
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,400
Others will say, Well, hold on,
we'd have to change the flag.

562
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,040
but we could do that.

563
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,720
I mean, sure, it would
look slightly different,

564
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,880
but we've been using a 51-star flag
for this whole segment

565
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,120
and none of you
have fucking noticed.

566
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,160
So, you know,
it wouldn't be...

567
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,840
it wouldn't be
a crazy thing.

568
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,200
And yes, yes,
it would probably screw up

569
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,400
the songs that
we learned as children,

570
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,080
but we could change those, too.
In fact, until DC's situation is fixed,

571
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,840
we've taken the liberty of adding
an amendment to that song.

572
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,200
Would you like to hear it,
boys and girls ?

573
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,600
Would you like to hear it ?
Come on ! Let's go ! Let's go !

574
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,520
- Hey, kids.
- Hi.

575
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,240
- How you doing ?
- Good !

576
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,200
Do you want to sing
a song about the 50 states

577
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,640
and the inequities inherent in
living in our nation's capitol ?

578
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,960
Yeah !

579
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,560
- Heck, let's do it, shall we ?
- Okay.

580
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,240
Alabama and Alaska,
Arizona, Arkansas,

581
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,240
Calofornia, Colorado,
Connecticut and more

582
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,120
There are 50 states in total
And we sing their names with glee

583
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,360
But that's one place that
gets shafted

584
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,000
And it's Washington DC.

585
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,400
That's great, kids.

586
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,840
Now, be more specific
about the problem.

587
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,200
All the rest of us can chose
a path

588
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,560
That we think it's best
But any choice that D.C. makes

589
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,120
Is easily supressed
'Cause some asshole with a rider

590
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,840
Who might live in Tennessee
Can destroy a needle program

591
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,720
For preventig HIV.

592
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,040
It's true ! It's horrifying,
but it's true.

593
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,080
What's a solution,
do you think ?

594
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,280
Let them have gun laws,
Let them have weed !

595
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,560
Why not ?

596
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,200
Let them decide
The things they need.

597
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,880
And if you're totally convinced
That there should be just 50 states

598
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,880
Well, then let's all kick out Florida
Cause no one thinks they're great.

599
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:12,680
Oh, yes, let's all kick out Florida
Cause no one thinks they're great.

600
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,520
Cause no one thinks they're great.

601
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,360
That's our show ! Thank you
so much for watching !

602
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,320
Thanks to all the kids ! We'll see
you next week ! Good night !

603
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,480
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
with John Oliver

604
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,320
END OF EPISODE 23
