00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,160
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,040
Season II,
Episode 24

3
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,920
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight" !

4
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,680
I'm John Oliver. It's time
for a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,840
We begin with US politics.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,200
And for much of the week,
everyone was waiting for this.

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,480
Tonight, the first debate with
the top 10 candidates in the polls:

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,920
five governors, three senators,
a neurosurgeon

9
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,760
and a real estate developer.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,920
That is either an overpacked stage

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,280
or the worst season ever
of "Dancing with the Stars".

12
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,920
And I am very much including
the season

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,040
when David Hasselhoff ejaculated
a cha-cha-cha.

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,800
But let's not kid ourselves here.

15
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,720
This debate was only ever going to be
about one person.

16
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,800
And from the very first question,

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,280
he was the focus
of everyone's attention.

18
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,400
Is there anyone on stage...
If so, raise your hand.

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,000
...who is unwilling tonight
to pledge your support

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,040
to the eventual nominee
of the Republican party

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,720
and pledge to not run an independent
campaign against that person ?

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,720
Mr. Trump.

23
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,240
Why is that audience acting surprised ?

24
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,400
That couldn't have been more
of a setup for Trump

25
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,440
if the prompt had been: "Raise
your hand if your dad left you"

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,840
"millions of dollars
instead of hugging you."

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,760
The entire debate was basically
a two-hour circus sideshow

28
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,320
with an old piece of luggage covered
in Cheez Whiz at its center.

29
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,920
And the whole thing
will be quickly forgotten.

30
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,840
The main headlines the next day
were nothing to do

31
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,840
with the battle between
the candidates,

32
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,880
but between Donald Trump
and moderator Megyn Kelly,

33
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,000
which culminated in this.

34
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,280
She starts asking me
all sorts of ridiculous questions.

35
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,440
You could see there was blood
coming out of her eyes,

36
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,720
blood coming out of her wherever.

37
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,120
Her "wherever" ?

38
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,320
You can only imagine how talented
a lover Donald Trump must be.

39
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,960
"I'm just gonna put my thingamajig
in your wherever"

40
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,400
"and I'm gonna waggle it around."

41
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,920
If you want to hear more
on the Trump-Kelly showdown,

42
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,760
you can basically watch
any news network right now,

43
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,920
'cause it's all they're
talking about.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,520
But we are going to move on,
and I'll tell you why.

45
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,880
This whole debacle
was meaningless.

46
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,640
The 2016 election
will not depend on this,

47
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,200
because it's 457 days away.

48
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,680
There will be actual babies born
on election day 2016

49
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,200
whose parents
haven't even met yet.

50
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,080
So, everyone pace yourselves
and let's move on to India.

51
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,480
The last time a British person
said that,

52
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,560
we didn't leave for about 200 years.

53
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,480
India had some dramatic
technological news this week.

54
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,360
This man is outraged
after the government in India banned

55
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,160
hundreds of adult websites.

56
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,240
It's my life.
What I do inside my room,

57
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,760
the government can't influence it
whatsoever.

58
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,400
The order came over the weekend from
the telecommunications department.

59
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,120
It's true. The Indian government
banned 857 URLs,

60
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,120
most of them porn sites,
including, and these are real:

61
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,600
jizzhut.com, ass-butt.com
and momhandjob.com.

62
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,280
If you're a fan
of one of those sites,

63
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,920
it was probably an emotionally
turbulent day for you.

64
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,760
Although, if you're a fan
of momhandjob.com,

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,600
I'm guessing every day is
an emotionally turbulent day.

66
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,960
Now, according
to the Indian government,

67
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,120
the aim was partly "to prevent
pornography from becoming"

68
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,320
"a social nuisance".

69
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,000
But the decision set off
a fiery public debate.

70
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,280
How am I, in the confines
of my home,

71
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,840
without hurting a third person
or influencing a third person,

72
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,880
causing disruption to public order ?

73
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,680
You might get corrupted
and then become a sex maniac.

74
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,520
A sex maniac ?
That's weirdly prudish,

75
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,400
because India is not famously
repressed about sex.

76
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,560
Remember, this is the nation
that brought us the "Kama Sutra",

77
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,640
a sort of mix between sex,
yoga and a skiing accident.

78
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,760
The ban was actually
lifted just two days later,

79
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,920
but the Indian government should not
feel bad about giving in,

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,640
because if their aim was to tamp down
their citizens' libidos,

81
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,760
there is no better way
than by allowing full access

82
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,560
to the web sites they banned,
such as, and these are real:

83
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,680
randyhags.com,
oldwomanface.com,

84
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,440
all-free-nude-old-granny-mature
women-xxx-porn-pics.com

85
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,560
and the penis-haunting
maturewitch.com.

86
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,800
India...

87
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,400
If you want your population
to look at less pornography,

88
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,560
don't just unblock these sites,
make them mandatory,

89
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,160
because, believe me,
after looking at them,

90
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,480
I never want to have sex again.

91
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,320
And finally we turn to Whole Foods,

92
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,640
gentrification in edible form.

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,440
Now, this week,
Whole Foods found itself

94
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,320
in something of an all-natural,
handpicked, locally grown pickle.

95
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,800
Those are stalks of asparagus
soaking in a jar of water

96
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,320
for sale at a Whole Foods store
in Los Angeles for 6 dollars.

97
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,680
Okay, first, nobody should be buying
premade asparagus water

98
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,000
when you make it yourself
every time you eat asparagus.

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,440
And second, 6 dollars ?

100
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,240
Water is free and a pound of asparagus
from Whole Foods costs 5 dollars.

101
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,720
Their customers
were not happy about this,

102
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,120
but the store insisted
it was just an honest mistake.

103
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,760
Whole Foods now says the drink
was supposed to be water infused

104
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,440
with the essence of vegetables,
like asparagus,

105
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,840
but was made incorrectly
and it's been removed.

106
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,040
Yeah, that doesn't sound
any less terrible.

107
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,160
"We won't just sell you asparagus
stalks in a jar of water."

108
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,680
"We take the asparagus out first
and then sell you the jar of water."

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,600
"That way, we can call the leftover
wet asparagus"

110
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,000
"'artisanally moistened' and sell it
for three times the price."

111
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,280
It's an apology that rings
somewhat hollow,

112
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,960
coming from a chain that is fighting
the accusation

113
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,080
it routinely overcharges
its New York City customers

114
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,200
and whose products are often
as bizarre as they are expensive,

115
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,080
from egg white chips

116
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,160
to a jar of speciality honey
that costs 79,99 dollars.

117
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,600
You know who
I feel sorry for there ?

118
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,480
Any bear caught rampaging
through the store.

119
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,040
"What do you mean,
I owe 480 dollars ?"

120
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,720
"I had six jars ! What the fuck
are you talking about ?"

121
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,840
If Whole Foods really wants
to make this up to their customers,

122
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,120
they're gonna need
something like this.

123
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,440
Hi ! We at Whole Foods Market
would like to apologize

124
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,080
for our regrettable
6 dollar asparagus water.

125
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,960
We take our food seriously,
so we'd like to remind you

126
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,280
of the other high-quality,
non-ridiculous products

127
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,640
available at Whole Foods,

128
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,040
products like two baby carrots
tied together with artisanal twine.

129
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,960
Nobody's ever done that to carrots
before, so it's 35,99 dollars.

130
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,120
Or try a refreshing
probiotic avocado ice.

131
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,520
It's a block of ice with
an avocado balanced on top of it.

132
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,480
25,99 dollars.

133
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,640
Or how about trying
a bucket of water

134
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,200
collected from the back
of a cow that got rained on.

135
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,120
That's less than 60 dollars.

136
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,080
Or you know what ? Fuck it.
It's more than 60 dollars.

137
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,960
If you come in today, you can sample
our new in-season arrivals,

138
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,360
like a single pomegranate
that listened to NPR this morning,

139
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,280
an old satchel full
of loose yogurt and yams

140
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,000
or a bunch of granola that's been
blown back and forth between two fans.

141
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,520
Because you'll buy
anything that seems healthy

142
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,800
or meets some nebulous
definition of "good",

143
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,240
how about a tilapia
wearing yoga pants ?

144
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,360
Or a parsnip
that donated to Kony 2012 ?

145
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,200
Or some gay grapes ?

146
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,640
So, forget that stupid
asparagus water,

147
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,280
and please come down
to Whole Foods.

148
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,720
Whole Foods, an elaborate
practical joke

149
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,600
that got really out of hand.

150
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,360
Moving on.
Our main story tonight

151
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,520
concerns sex education,

152
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,520
the conversation that animals
in zoos refuse to let you not have.

153
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,360
With some kids going
back to school next week,

154
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,400
it's guaranteed that, at some point
over the next school year,

155
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,520
you'll hear stories like this.

156
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,160
Local parents are outraged tonight

157
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,920
over the pictures that their children
saw in sex ed class.

158
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,840
Some parents say
that the material,

159
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,560
which includes descriptions
of sex acts and infections,

160
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,520
is simply too graphic
for middle-schoolers.

161
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,520
A father is upset
after his 13-year-old showed him

162
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,840
a poster hanging
on a classroom door,

163
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,720
a poster listing sex acts.

164
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,720
Parental anger over sex ed

165
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,120
is as much a staple of the school year
as square pizza

166
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,240
and one kid coming back
from vacation with a mustache

167
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,720
he's way too proud of.

168
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,360
That's a ghost mustache, Lewis.

169
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,320
It looks like a real mustache
died on your face.

170
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,640
So we tried this week to find out

171
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,440
what sex ed looks like
in America right now.

172
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,200
But that turns out to be a surprisingly
difficult question to answer.

173
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,640
In the past,
depending on how old you are,

174
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,400
sex education may have been little
more than watching films like this.

175
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,720
Every so often,
I get a strong sex urge

176
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,960
and the only way I can take care of it
is to masturbate.

177
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,320
I'm pleased
that you can tell me about this.

178
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,880
Perhaps it's because we know
each other for so long.

179
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,000
My name is Johnny Stanton.

180
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,440
For me, it all started when I went
bowling with Judy today.

181
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,880
I should've known something was
different as soon as she got a strike.

182
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,680
She's usually
such a rotten bowler.

183
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,880
So, what's so different about you ?

184
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,240
- I got my first period today.
- So, what's the big deal ?

185
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,400
It means that blood is flowing out
of my uterus.

186
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,120
What ? Okay...

187
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,280
First, that is some
incredible misinformation.

188
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,240
Menstrual blood is not some sort
of uterine HGH

189
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,320
that makes you
amazing at bowling.

190
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,360
And second,
and this is true,

191
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,720
the young man in that video
is Jonathan Banks,

192
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,720
Mike from "Breaking Bad".

193
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,040
And if that video
does not provide

194
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,640
the basis for the prequel
to "Better Call Saul",

195
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,880
I'm going to be extremely disappointed.

196
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,000
Teaching sex ed in schools
is really important for obvious reasons.

197
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,720
No parent wants to talk
to his kids about sex

198
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,120
and no kid wants to talk
about sex with his parents.

199
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,080
That is why, when you're watching
a sex scene in a movie,

200
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,920
everyone becomes motionless

201
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,200
and silently begs
for the merciful release of death.

202
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,160
And kids have good questions
that need good answers.

203
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,920
The Times recently ran an article
with a slideshow of questions

204
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,760
kids wrote on cards
to a sex educator, including:

205
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,760
"Why is the boy's penis
shaped like an arrow ?",

206
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,840
"Is it okay to be gay ?",

207
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,520
"How long do I have to wait
to have sex ? I'm excited."

208
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,360
To which, the answers are:

209
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,720
"It's engorged with blood",
"yes",

210
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,760
and "can you at least wait
until the end of class ?".

211
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,040
But perhaps the most poignant
question was:

212
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,960
"Will this go well for me ?"

213
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,120
Because, after looking into
sex ed programs this week,

214
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,040
the answer depends quite a bit
on where you live.

215
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,320
There is no required standard
for sex ed in this country.

216
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,400
In fact, only 22 states mandate
that kids receive it,

217
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,840
and only 13 require that
the information presented

218
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,880
be medically accurate,
which is crazy.

219
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,240
You wouldn't accept a history class
not being historically accurate.

220
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,960
Prince started the American
Revolution in 1984

221
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,840
and his Purple Reign lasts until
the present day. Class dismissed.

222
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,000
We essentially have
a weird patchwork system

223
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,960
that varies wildly, and not
just from state to state,

224
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,280
but from district to district,
and even from school to school.

225
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,480
In fact, one Ohio newscast
tried to find out

226
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,760
what kids in their area were learning
and hit a brick wall.

227
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,320
The state has no sex ed guidelines,

228
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,000
so each district decides
what's best for whatever kid.

229
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,160
Many school districts
don't want to talk about it at all.

230
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,480
UC students polled
every school district

231
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,600
in four southwest
Ohio counties.

232
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,760
The majority wouldn't tell us what they
teach and when they teach it,

233
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,240
even though all of this is supposed
to be public information.

234
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,320
And that's really not good.

235
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,640
Two teenagers shouldn't have
completely different levels of sex ed

236
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,040
just because they're
in different school districts.

237
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,840
Tonight's football game is
between Lakewood High

238
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,440
and Middletown High.

239
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,080
Not only are they bitter rivals,

240
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,320
one of those teams has
no idea what a diaphragm is !

241
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,080
Let's play ball !

242
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,360
But while it is hard to find out
what kids are learning,

243
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,120
in some cases, it is possible
to find out what they are not learning.

244
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,200
For instance, in Mississippi,
while you can talk about contraceptives,

245
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,040
the law prohibits condom
demonstrations in class.

246
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,320
That means no condom
on a banana,

247
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,520
no condom on a cucumber,
no condom on a zucchini.

248
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,120
And that's terrible, partly because
it's fun putting condoms on produce.

249
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,840
But mainly because Mississippi
ranked number two in the country

250
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,560
in teen pregnancy rates.

251
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,320
Now, thankfully,
this situation has inspired

252
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,120
some creative alternatives.

253
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,240
Watch this former teacher describe
how to use a condom

254
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,520
without directly
using a condom.

255
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,200
I start with a sock.

256
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,440
I'm gonna pinch out the air
out of the tip of the sock

257
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,040
cause I wanna make sure
that there's room for my toes

258
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,160
when I'm engaging
in shoe activity.

259
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,880
Then I take the sock
and put it on top of my foot.

260
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,200
You wanna take your sock

261
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,040
and you wanna roll it
all the way down your foot.

262
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,680
And then you can put it
inside your shoe.

263
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,840
That is very clever.

264
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,120
Although, it's not perfect.

265
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,600
If you can't get a sock
out of the packaging,

266
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,520
you don't lose your foot for a minute

267
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,440
and need to think of Rihanna
to get it back.

268
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,800
It's back.

269
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,040
But Mississippi's restrictions
are just the beginning here.

270
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,160
In eight states, there are laws
considerably limiting

271
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,200
what teachers can say about
homosexuality to their students,

272
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,600
meaning the answer
to that kid's question,

273
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,520
"is it okay to be gay ?",
could be a shrug or a lot worse.

274
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,440
And Utah's law prohibits
any instruction

275
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,560
in the intricacies of intercourse

276
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,360
for reasons that one
state legislator explained.

277
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,960
Those are the things we do not want
to be taught in our schools.

278
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,560
Those are things that should
be taught in your home.

279
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,400
Wait. "Taught in your home" ?

280
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,520
Here is an exchange
that has never happened.

281
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,360
"How are you so good at sex ?"

282
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,040
"I was home-schooled."

283
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,560
And in certain districts
around the country,

284
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,680
the only sex ed you might
receive is abstinence-only,

285
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,520
which you may think of
as a relic of the past,

286
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,720
but it is still very much around.

287
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,120
Congress increased federal funding
for abstinence-only education

288
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,320
from about 50 to 75 million dollars
per year.

289
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,520
And at least part of that money
gets matched by the states,

290
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,120
which means that students
are still being exposed

291
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,680
to abstinence-centered programs,
but with names like WAIT,

292
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,080
which stands
for "Why Am I Tempted ?",

293
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,440
Go APE, or "Abstinence
Protects Everyone",

294
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,840
and "No Screwin' Around,"
which I presume stands for

295
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,840
"No One Should Copulate
Regularly Except Wedded Individuals."

296
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,680
"Now, A Reach-around Occasionally
Ultimately Not Disastrous."

297
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,840
Here is a taste of a video
from that last program.

298
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,880
If you have sex,

299
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,720
outside of one permanent
monogamous...

300
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,440
And monogamy does not mean
one at a time.

301
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,720
It means one partner
who has only been with you.

302
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,760
You have sex outside of that context,
and you will pay.

303
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,160
Boys, if there's a girl
throwing herself at you,

304
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,320
if she's the one
pressuring you for sex,

305
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,960
if this is a girl that's dressing
in a slutty manner,

306
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,840
I got a little word
of advice for you.

307
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,840
Run from this girl. Run !

308
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,160
I did not say walk away slowly.
I said run from her !

309
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,960
Don't even bother running, boys,
just cut your dicks off.

310
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,440
Girls are snake charmers
and it's time to murder your snakes.

311
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,240
Do it !

312
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,480
Abstinence is a healthy choice
that many teens will make,

313
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,800
either by choice, or, as I can attest,
by circumstance.

314
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,240
But that's not the point.

315
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,360
It should not be
the only thing you teach,

316
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,200
and not just because many studies
question its efficacy.

317
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,920
The fact is,
according to the CDC,

318
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,520
most Americans have more than one
sexual partner in their lifetime,

319
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,280
and the average age at which people
begin having sex is around 17.

320
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,640
So, just saying "don't do it"
is not practical.

321
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,160
And even when
they do teach sex ed,

322
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,360
schools can teach it
with a strong bias.

323
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,600
We found a company
which offers schools

324
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,600
two versions of the same video
on contraception.

325
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,960
Version "B" is labeled
as being nonjudgmental.

326
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
Take a look.

327
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,400
Look, no one ever said
being a teenager is easy.

328
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,960
You have to face a lot
of important decisions.

329
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,360
But no decision is
probably more important

330
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,280
than the one you'll make about
becoming sexually active.

331
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,800
Some of you may already
be sexually active.

332
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,000
But still, a lot of you
are not having sex yet.

333
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,920
You could be waiting for marriage,
the right person

334
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,120
or maybe you're just not ready
to take on

335
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,840
this very serious responsibility
right now.

336
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,400
Cool.

337
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,160
Folks, those 30-year-old actors

338
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,640
dressed like teenagers from the '90s
make some very good points.

339
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,680
However, version "A",
which is non-nonjudgmental,

340
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,480
goes in a slightly different direction.
See if you can spot it.

341
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,160
No one ever said
being a teenager is easy.

342
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,560
You have to face a lot
of important decisions.

343
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,600
But no decision is more important

344
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,360
than the one you'll make about
becoming sexually active.

345
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,560
As a teenager, you're expected
to wait until you're married

346
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,400
before you become sexually active.

347
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,040
Until then, abstinence
is the only option that's acceptable

348
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,480
to your family, your school
and your community.

349
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Hold on.

350
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,920
Why did they even keep the first part
about it being a decision at all ?

351
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,280
They should've said
"no decision is more nonexistent"

352
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,760
"than the one you don't
get to make about sex."

353
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,000
"Also, God is
watching you masturbate"

354
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,400
"and the fluids coming out of your
genitals are actually His tears."

355
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,760
"You're making Him sad."

356
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,520
But the very fact two videos
with the same title

357
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,120
but very different messages exist
shows just how hard it can be

358
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,000
to find out what's going on
with sex ed where you live.

359
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,960
And this is not even accounting
for guest speakers

360
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,680
that schools can bring in
to augment their program.

361
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,840
Remember this woman ?

362
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,080
That's Pam Stenzel.
Her web site claims

363
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,840
she speaks to half a million
young people each year,

364
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,680
presumably like this.

365
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,320
Here's the line over
which you can't step.

366
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:49,360
Absolutely no genital contact
of any kind.

367
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,600
That's hand to genital,

368
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,240
mouth to genital,
genital to genital.

369
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,080
Oral sex, which is
mouth to genital, is sex !

370
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,480
And if you have ever
stepped over this line,

371
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,160
you've risked disease,
and you need to get tested

372
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,360
and don't you dare tell anyone
you're a virgin !

373
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,040
Why are you trying to yell
the horniness out of teenagers ?

374
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,840
Programs like hers are
so relentlessly anti-sex,

375
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,640
you could easily come away
thinking the adult world

376
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,240
is just an endless barrage
of unwanted dicks,

377
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,800
which, incidentally,
was the original slogan for Tinder.

378
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,320
But the problem is...

379
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,320
The problem is,
Stenzel is not alone.

380
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,560
Shelly Donahue currently speaks
at schools around the country.

381
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,280
She shows the dangers
of more than one sexual partner

382
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,400
by describing women
as a piece of tape

383
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,800
and then sticking the tape
to the arms of multiple boys

384
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,360
until this happens.

385
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,720
How many partners do we have
before we get married on average ?

386
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,000
Six, yeah.

387
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,160
Can you imagine what's going
to start to happen to the tape ?

388
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,440
It's going to lose
its bonding power.

389
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,360
Her point is, the tape is used so much,
it becomes damaged,

390
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,720
which doesn't even consider
the possibility

391
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,160
that the tape might be perfectly happy

392
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,680
or that maybe some guys like tape
that already knows how to stick

393
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,080
when they meet them.

394
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,560
But this idea that sex is something
which devalues those who've had it,

395
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,720
particularly women,
crops up again and again.

396
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,640
Non-virgins can be likened
to a used toothbrush

397
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,680
or a chewed-up
piece of gum.

398
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,920
And then, there is this video

399
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,080
in which a non-virgin on her wedding
night is compared to a dirty shoe.

400
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,480
Michelle, what are these ?

401
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,440
My sneakers.

402
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,280
Michelle, what is this ?

403
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,600
It looks like the entire football team
has been in these things.

404
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,520
I made 'em all wear socks.

405
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,320
Socks ? But, you know,
socks don't protect my heart.

406
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,480
You can still get
foot fungus with socks.

407
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,560
I wish I could go back in time

408
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,800
and make a commitment
to be abstinent until marriage.

409
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,880
That is heartbreaking,

410
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
and not just because
he's shaming his wife,

411
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,480
but because "Michelle,
socks don't protect my heart"

412
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,280
might be the funniest line
ever delivered on this show

413
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,240
and we didn't write it.

414
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,360
And that kind of message
can be hugely damaging

415
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,160
to anyone who hears it,

416
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,880
especially survivors
of sexual assault,

417
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,520
like Elizabeth Smart,

418
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,000
who was kidnapped and assaulted
at the age of 14.

419
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,400
And you may recognize
one of the metaphors

420
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,880
she remembers
one of her teachers using.

421
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,680
She said: "Imagine you're
a stick of gum."

422
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,440
"When you engage in sex,
that's like getting chewed."

423
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,040
"If you do that lots of times, you're
gonna become an old piece of gum,"

424
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,680
"and who's going to want you
after that ?"

425
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,240
That's terrible

426
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,720
and nobody should ever say that.

427
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,640
I thought, "Oh, my gosh,
I'm that chewed-up piece of gum !"

428
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,160
Learning nothing would've been
better than learning that.

429
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,360
It's not a great reflection
on her teacher

430
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,160
that kids who were sick that day got
a better education than she did.

431
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,280
And the sad thing is, sex ed, when
done well, can do so much good.

432
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,240
But when it's done badly,
it can do real harm.

433
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,040
Take consent. A recent survey found
college students were confused

434
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,680
about certain aspects of it.

435
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,080
When asked whether another
person undressing, getting a condom

436
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,960
or nodding established consent

437
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,240
for more sexual activity,
at least 40% said yes

438
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,520
and at least 40% said no.

439
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,880
And that ambiguity is a problem,
because sex is like boxing.

440
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,240
If both people didn't fully agree
to participate,

441
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,640
one of them is
committing a crime.

442
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,520
And abstinence-heavy
messages do not help this.

443
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,560
They spend so much time
on the importance of saying no,

444
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,560
they can leave out what informed
consent looks like,

445
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,440
or, even worse, suggest that it's all
one party's responsibility,

446
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,960
like in this video from a program
called "Sex Smart"

447
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,360
about fending off
unwanted advances.

448
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,800
Maybe we should have sex
to prove our love for each other.

449
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,720
Do you think we're ready ?

450
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
Yeah, I'm ready.

451
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,960
That didn't work.

452
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,600
No.

453
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,280
Does that mean no or yes ?

454
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,680
One more try. This time,
say it like you mean it.

455
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,520
No way.

456
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,600
Finally !

457
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,400
Maybe we should
just get to the concert.

458
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,480
Wait. They were already late
for a concert,

459
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,800
but he felt there was
still time to have sex ?

460
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,960
That is a teenage boy with a very
accurate sense of his abilities.

461
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,280
But much more
to the point here,

462
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,000
it's good that that girl knew
she has the power to say no.

463
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,080
But nowhere
do they point out

464
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,360
that guy should have been
a lot better at hearing it.

465
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,640
And it is weird to gloss over
something so appalling.

466
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,400
It's like that moment in "Grease"
when Kenickie sang

467
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,200
"Tell me more, tell me more.
Did she put up a fight ?"

468
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,400
That's the point they should've
stopped the song and gone:

469
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,840
"What the fuck
did you just say ?"

470
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,360
"What is wrong with you, Kenickie ?"

471
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,240
"You're a monster !"

472
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,960
"And you look 40 !"

473
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,280
When kids graduate high school
without a full understanding of consent,

474
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,480
you are abetting
an already troubling culture

475
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,320
where a bunch of frat guys
can march around Yale

476
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,320
feeling completely comfortable
yelling out this.

477
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:37,480
No means yes,
yes means anal !

478
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,600
Yale's acceptance
rate is 6.3%,

479
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,440
so who the fuck are
they turning down ?

480
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,520
I would hate to hear their chants.

481
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,960
That is not an isolated incident.

482
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,520
Last year, fraternities
at both Texas Tech and LSU

483
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,480
were caught using
the same slogan.

484
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,960
It's something you hear
on college campuses

485
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,240
as often as "I'm thinking
of switching majors"

486
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,920
or "why is James Franco here ?".

487
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,200
And here is the thing.

488
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,600
There is no way we'd allow
any other academic program

489
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,920
to consistently fail to prepare
students for life after school.

490
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,600
And human sexuality,
unlike calculus,

491
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,120
is something you actually
need to know about

492
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,800
for the rest of your life.

493
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,880
And maybe you live somewhere
that has good sex ed,

494
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,040
in which case,
congratulations.

495
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,000
But if you don't,
this video is for you.

496
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,160
Abstinence and/or Sex First:
Teen Birth Control Decisions

497
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,080
Look, no one ever said
being a teenager is easy.

498
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,120
You face a lot
of important decisions.

499
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,560
But no decision is
probably more important...

500
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,880
Than the one you'll make about
becoming sexually active.

501
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,480
And if you do, there's a few things
you should definitely know.

502
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
ANATOMY

503
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,840
This is a penis.

504
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,120
This is a vagina.

505
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,040
This is a mouth.

506
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,280
- This is a hand.
- And this is a butt.

507
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,640
You can mix as many of these
as you feel comfortable with.

508
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,080
Hand and mouth would
be weird, but you could.

509
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,240
This is the clitoris.

510
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,120
And these are the testicles.

511
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,800
They make sperm.
That's pretty much it.

512
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,760
ABSTINENCE

513
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,560
If you want to be abstinent, fine.

514
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,520
If you don't want to be abstinent,
that's also fine.

515
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,200
Abstinence is like
being a vegetarian.

516
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,000
People should
respect your choice.

517
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,920
Some people might
make fun of you.

518
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,280
Those people are assholes.

519
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,040
Contraception and STDS

520
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,160
The best safeguard
against STDs is protection.

521
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,840
Unless you already
have an STD,

522
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,760
in which case you're gonna need
medicine or some shit.

523
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840
Fun fact !

524
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,960
The ancient Egyptians put crocodile
dung mixed with honey

525
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,440
inside a vagina
to prevent pregnancy.

526
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,800
They're all dead now.

527
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,960
Here's how you put
a condom on a banana.

528
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,400
Well, this is a lot less curvy
than I'm used to.

529
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,280
This is an IUD.

530
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,880
An IUD goes inside a woman's body
and prevents pregnancy.

531
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,160
They can stay inside you
for up to 10 years.

532
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,920
Which is a lot, considering
most guys in high school

533
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,120
can only stay inside you
for a minute or two, tops. Am I right ?

534
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,080
Here's a bunch of other forms
of birth control. Google them !

535
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,680
Consent

536
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,960
This is actually simple.

537
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,480
If someone doesn't want
to have sex with you,

538
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,760
don't have sex with them.

539
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,960
If you think you might be able to
persuade someone to have sex,

540
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,480
even though they don't want to,
don't.

541
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,280
If you're not sure if someone wants
to have sex with you, ask.

542
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,160
Even if you're
kind of sure, still ask.

543
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,120
If someone is pretty drunk, they might
not be able to give consent.

544
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,480
And remember,
you can always say no.

545
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,360
Even halfway through,
you can say no.

546
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,520
If someone wants you to do a sex
thing you're not ok with,

547
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
you can refuse.

548
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,720
Say: "I don't care if it's
your birthday."

549
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,040
"I don't want you to put
your finger in my butt !"

550
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,160
Real quick,
a couple of final things.

551
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,600
"Most people will get HPV"
is both technically true...

552
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,000
And what you tend to hear right
before someone gives you HPV.

553
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,320
If you call it a "hooha",
you are not ready for sex.

554
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,880
Lube is your friend, believe me.

555
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,560
If you get a chance
to have sex with this man,

556
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,200
go for it.

557
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,400
The best safeword
is "hootenanny".

558
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,360
A woman who's had sex
is not like a dirty shoe.

559
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,640
A woman who's had sex is
a like a shoe with laces.

560
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,600
Completely fucking normal.

561
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,400
And finally,
and this is important,

562
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,920
if anyone ever tells you
that getting your period

563
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,840
makes you better at bowling,
they're a fucking idiot.

564
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,560
GOOD LUCK !

565
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,200
That's our show.
Thank you for watching.

566
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,760
We'll see you next week !

567
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,680
The best safeword
is "apples".

568
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,160
"Spinach quiche."

569
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,640
"Beef carpaccio."

570
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,120
"Supercalifragilistic-
expiali-no-cious."

571
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,000
