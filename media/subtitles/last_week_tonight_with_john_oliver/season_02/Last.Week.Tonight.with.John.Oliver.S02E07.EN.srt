00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,480
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,120
SEASON II, EPISODE 7

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,920
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,080
Time for a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,040
And we begin in Israel.
Drama-wise, the opposite of Canada.

6
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,480
Israel had their election this week,
and despite being behind in the polls,

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,360
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
Likud party won resoundingly

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,280
which some credit to Netanyahu's last
minute swing to the even farther right.

9
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,640
The Prime Minister Netanyahu

10
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,880
said there's not going to be
a Palestine or a two-state solution.

11
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,640
So no two-state solution then.
But let's not jump to conclusions.

12
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,200
Maybe he only said that because he's
planning on a three-state solution:

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,360
Israel, Palestine,
and bonus Palestine.

14
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,920
We don't know for sure.
Let's accept that in part

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,960
due to that promise
Netanyahu looks like he's here to stay.

16
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,200
The problem he has is how
is he going to convince the US

17
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,920
that he's a credible partner
for negotiation,

18
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:39,280
given that he said he would not allow
a two-state solution !

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,040
I don't want a one-state solution.
I want a sustainable,

20
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,680
peaceful two-state solution
but circumstances have to change.

21
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,160
That's pretty impressive.

22
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,680
Because that is a Michael Jackson
level of walking backwards.

23
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,400
He demonstrated
the verbal gymnastics

24
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,200
of a guy caught
being too honest on his first date.

25
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,880
"I don't want kids.
You want kids ? I love kids,

26
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,720
and in the right circumstances,
I could see myself having them.

27
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,600
I never said I don't want kids."

28
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,480
This is why what Netanyahu
just said is so amazing:

29
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,320
he was trying to escape
something that he'd said

30
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,800
that had left him
almost no wiggle room.

31
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,120
Asked if that meant
there would be no Palestinian state

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,440
if he were to continue
as Prime Minister,

33
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,480
Netanyahu responded, correct.

34
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,760
How do you get out of that ?
It's impossible. I've gotta say:

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,120
if he somehow escapes this, he should
go on the road as Netanyahoudini.

36
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,680
Words cannot hold him.
Let's move on to Starbucks,

37
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,960
the acoustic Alanis Morrisette album
with a coffeehouse wrapped around it.

38
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,520
CEO Howard Schultz unveiled
a bold new initiative to his employees.

39
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,960
What if we were to write race together
on every Starbucks cup ?

40
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,080
And that facilitated a conversation
between you and our customers ?

41
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,080
If a customer asks you what this is,
try and engage in a discussion

42
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,960
that we have problems in this country
with regard to race, racial inequality.

43
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,600
I think it's pretty clear: no one
has said no to this guy in 25 years.

44
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,760
A conversation about race
is clearly important,

45
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,560
but there's a time and a place.

46
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,760
It is not the length of time it takes
to whip up a tiramisu Frappuccino.

47
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,200
Let's give Howard Schultz credit:
he did start a conversation

48
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,160
across the racial divide, with
a white billionaire pitching an idea,

49
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,320
and African-American customers
telling him how stupid it was.

50
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,320
Not sure what Starbucks was thinking.
I don't have time to explain

51
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,840
400 years of oppression to you
and still make my train.

52
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,160
I'm not sure that systemic change is
gonna happen by talking to the barista.

53
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,400
He's right. Best-case scenario,

54
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,400
you get a heartfelt conversation
about race going,

55
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,040
only to have it justifiably
interrupted by someone screaming,

56
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,160
"Can we solve racism later ?
I'm late for fucking work."

57
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,680
And the problems didn't stop there,
because Starbucks wound up

58
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,960
having some conversations about race
that it probably hadn't anticipated.

59
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,920
Many people put up a link
to the company's website

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,360
actually featuring pictures of mostly
white, mostly male leadership.

61
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,160
The race together campaign
is taking a lot of flack online

62
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,000
with many people bashing
the company on Twitter

63
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,560
including some questioning
why Starbucks promotional photos

64
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,280
only included white hands.

65
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,640
How's that conversation on race going,
Starbucks ? Lot of fun, right ?

66
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,960
What if this could be every morning ?

67
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,520
But it was what happened
as a result of that backlash

68
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,920
that shows you how unprepared
Starbucks was for this conversation.

69
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,680
Starbucks' own
VP of Communications

70
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,200
temporarily deleting his Twitter
account under an avalanche of criticism

71
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,360
saying he felt personally
attacked in a cascade of negativity.

72
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,120
End of conversation, I guess everyone.
Good talk, good talk, people.

73
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,800
Nice try ! Now you can go back to doing
what you do best: burning coffee

74
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,800
and glaring at us for using your
bathrooms without buying anything.

75
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,320
Just stay in your lane.
And finally, tonight: New Hampshire.

76
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,880
Where live free or die
is a legitimately difficult choice.

77
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,400
It is always held a special place
in American politics,

78
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,280
and earlier this month,
some local fourth graders

79
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,600
visited the state capitol
to learn how government worked.

80
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,960
A group of fourth graders
including nine-year-old Maia Roka

81
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,840
crafted a bill to make the red-tailed
hawk the official state raptor.

82
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,200
Mr. Cutting's fourth grade class

83
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,160
arrived to watch their house bill
come up for a vote,

84
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,200
greeted by enthusiastic applause.

85
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,680
That's fantastic.
What a great opportunity for the kids

86
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,760
to engage in the political process
and be inspired.

87
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,680
I can presume that their state raptor
bill sailed right through.

88
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,240
We have a state bird but now
do we need a state raptor ?

89
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,920
Isn't that a bird ?
Isn't that an animal ?

90
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,880
So are we gonna have
flightless birds, water fowl,

91
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,680
pet birds, garden birds,
wild birds...

92
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,280
How many bills do we need ?

93
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,640
If we keep bringing more of these bills
and bills and bills forward,

94
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,800
I feel we shouldn't have in front of us
we'll be picking a state hot dog next.

95
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,240
What is wrong with you ?
A, this doesn't matter.

96
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,160
B, the children are in the room.
And C, this doesn't matter.

97
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,480
Just vote yes and make them happy.
And sadly, the story didn't end there.

98
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,840
State representative Warren Groen
also decided it was appropriate

99
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,840
to use the red-tailed hawk to make
a completely unnecessary point.

100
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,680
It's known for it's strong and sharp
talons with which it grasps its prey.

101
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,680
But it grasp them with its talons
and then uses its razor-sharp beak

102
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,880
to rip its victim to shreds and to
basically tear it apart limb by limb.

103
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,240
The shame
about making this a state bird is,

104
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,720
it would serve as a much better mascot
for Planned Parenthood.

105
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,520
What the fuck are you talking about ?
For a start,

106
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,080
everyone knows Planned Parenthood
already has a mascot !

107
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,560
It's plan bee,
the Planned Parenthood bee !

108
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,720
"Did you hear the buzz
on spermicidal lubricant ?

109
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,600
No. Thank you plan bee.
You're the best."

110
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,000
This wasn't a few cranks.

111
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,040
The legislature defeated
the children's bill, 133 to 160.

112
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,680
And then celebrated by looking up
at the kids and saying,

113
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,880
"Nice try, idiots. Santa's not real
and Dora the Explorer can't hear you."

114
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,200
This must have been devastating
for the kids.

115
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,800
But if their stupid state government
will not honor the red-tailed hawk,

116
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,320
then we will.

117
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,280
And that is why I am proud
to announce the red-tailed hawk

118
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,720
is the new official raptor
of Last Week Tonight.

119
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,920
Here it is ! A real live predatory hawk
in a television studio !

120
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,520
To show how wrong
New Hampshire legislators were

121
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,760
to deny those fourth graders
from Lincoln Akerman school

122
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,880
their red tailed hawk request,
we've prepared this.

123
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,440
Red tailed hawks.

124
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,240
The official raptors
of Last Week Tonight.

125
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,200
Why ? Because they effing rock !
They'll take out a rattlesnake !

126
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,400
Chill on a basketball hoop.
Then they'll feed their babies.

127
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,520
But wait, that's not all.

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,240
They'll grab a pheasant
while doing a mid-air 360 !

129
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,640
- Let's watch that again.
- Rewind.

130
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,280
Awesome !
But don't just take it from us.

131
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,920
Here's some red tailed hawk facts
from a guy in the nineties.

132
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,680
Red tail hawks,

133
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,720
probably the most common
bird of prey in the US.

134
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,400
This guy's incredible.
Give me more hawk facts man.

135
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,320
Their grasping strength

136
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,960
is about 200 pounds
per square inch of pressure.

137
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,080
Badass ! One more hawk fact.

138
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,280
The stooping speed for the red tail
is about 100 to 120 miles an hour.

139
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,480
That's enough hawk facts.

140
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,520
All this is why the red tailed hawk
is Last Week Tonight's official raptor.

141
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,920
Raptor scream !

142
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,720
Congratulations, fourth graders !
Red hawks are awesome !

143
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,520
And now, this !

144
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,840
People on TV honoring St. Patrick's Day
in the most offensive way possible.

145
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,920
Top of the morning to ya there !

146
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,440
- Top of the morning to ya.
- Top of the morning to ya, kiddies.

147
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,200
Top of the morning to ya.

148
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,960
Happy St. Patrick's Day.

149
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,720
Happy St. Patrick's Day,
everybody !

150
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,120
- Wee bit of a parade.
- Wee bit.

151
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,480
They have
their beautiful outfits ready.

152
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,440
I can't do an Irish accent.
Hello lassie !

153
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,480
What are you talking about Brad ?

154
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,440
- You sound Jamaican.
- I sound Jamaican ?

155
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:59,560
Moving on: our main story tonight
concerns municipal violations.

156
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,680
They're the small,
everyday ways of breaking the law,

157
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,920
like speeding, or trespassing,
or failing to vaccinate your ferret.

158
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,000
That is against the law
so sorry, ferret Jenny McCarthy.

159
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,280
You're just gonna have
to get it done.

160
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,720
We have all committed
municipal violations.

161
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,240
But if you've never
gotten a ticket for one,

162
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,400
all I can say is congratulations
on not getting caught.

163
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,200
Now for most people,
tickets are just annoying.

164
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,480
We grin and bear them or,
as in this case of this young woman,

165
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,640
throw a passive-aggressive tantrum.

166
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,120
- Citations for...
- My headlights weren't on.

167
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,360
Yes, you're right. Citations
for not having your headlights on.

168
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:48,240
- Let me explain it, okay ?
- I need to pay it, I'm late.

169
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,720
You know that woman
behaves that way in every situation.

170
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,200
"I totally get it. It's a funeral.

171
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,320
Mindy was a person,
now she's gonna be eaten by worms.

172
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,800
Just put her in the ground
so I can get to soul cycle. I'm late !"

173
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,840
She's probably not thought
about that ticket until now.

174
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,080
She's getting a lot of text messages
from friends saying,

175
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,560
"Amber ! You're totally on HBO
right now shouting at a cop !"

176
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,400
But if you don't have enough money
to pay a fine immediately,

177
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,320
tickets can wreck your life.

178
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,080
Let me introduce you
to Harriet Cleveland.

179
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,240
She had some low-level traffic tickets.
Couldn't pay them straight away.

180
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:39,160
She accumulated other fees and tickets,
which she was unable to pay off.

181
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,760
And then, one morning,
this happened !

182
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,160
I had my grandbaby with me,
I was sitting up giving him breakfast,

183
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,560
and I heard a knock on the door
and I seen the police officer.

184
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,840
In the back of my mind,
it wasn't for me

185
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,080
because I didn't figure
they'd come get you for tickets.

186
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,520
I was escorted to jail.

187
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,960
If you're thinking:
how is it possible

188
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,960
for a grandmother
to go to jail for traffic tickets ?

189
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,880
That is what this story is about.

190
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,680
Because most tickets
come with a fine.

191
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,640
If you've lived paycheck to paycheck,
you know that can be difficult.

192
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,720
In DeKalb County, Alabama,
a speeding ticket is $255.50.

193
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,400
If you earn minimum wage there,
$7.25 an hour,

194
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,560
it would take you more than
35 hours of work to pay that off.

195
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,920
Which seems harsh.
Because the only justifiable way

196
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,240
you should lose an entire week
of your life due to speeding

197
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,960
is if you hit 88 miles an hour
and go back in time.

198
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,320
And sometimes, governments
will take a reasonable base fine

199
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,960
and turn it into that something
people may not be able to afford,

200
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,800
as they've done in California.

201
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,560
The actual fine
for running a stop sign is $35

202
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,040
but by the time the state tacks
on 10 different surcharges and fees,

203
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,440
the amount you owes jumps to $238.

204
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,120
To put that in perspective,
I went on e-bay this morning,

205
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,440
and $238 is the current asking
price for this glorious unicorn

206
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,040
with wheels on its hooves.

207
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,920
if you live in California
and run a stop sign,

208
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,160
you can either pay your ticket
or own a unicorn.

209
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,560
Courts know that not everyone
can pay fines straight away.

210
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,840
Which is why
some allow a payment plan.

211
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,320
Unfortunately, that can turn out
to be even more expensive.

212
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,520
In Illinois, the state adds on 30%
if you fall behind in your payments.

213
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,240
In New Orleans it costs you a 100 bucks
just to sign up for a payment plan.

214
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,960
Yes. Your payment plan
begins with a payment plan payment.

215
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,520
It's like your probation officer
is MC Escher.

216
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,080
"Go pay the clerk at the top of that
endless staircase. You'll be fine."

217
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,320
And this situation is widespread.

218
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,000
At least 44 states charge people
a fee to be on probation.

219
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,520
And many municipalities
use these charges

220
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,640
as a way to fund local services
without raising taxes.

221
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,800
I that rings a bell, it may be
because of Ferguson, Missouri.

222
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,960
When the department of justice report
uncovered institutional racism,

223
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,960
it found one of the ways was
in the use of fines as a cash machine.

224
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,000
The report says officers competed to
see who could write the most tickets.

225
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,320
It concludes police officer's promotions
depended on citation revenue.

226
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,600
There's the story of a police commander
who one day bragged to his superiors

227
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,040
about seeing a steady stream of people,
10 to 15 deep,

228
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,160
waiting in line for hours
to pay traffic fines.

229
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,280
He wrote, the court clerk girls
have been swamped.

230
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,040
And the city manager responded,
great work.

231
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,160
Setting aside the fact that he used
the phrase, court clerk girls,

232
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,200
that situation is ridiculous.

233
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,680
The only people
who should be that excited

234
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,040
about people waiting in line
to hand over way too much money

235
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,600
are Apple executives.

236
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,360
If you couldn't pay immediately
in Ferguson, they could bleed you dry.

237
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,280
Listen to just one example.

238
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,800
In 2007, one woman

239
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,800
received two parking tickets
that together totaled $152.

240
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,560
To date, she has paid $550 in fines
and fees to the city of Ferguson.

241
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,120
Yet today, she still inexplicably
owes Ferguson $541.

242
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,920
That's more than $1,000
for $150 in tickets.

243
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,120
Even people stocking hotel minibars
are thinking it seems a little high.

244
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,240
Just settle down.

245
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,120
Using fines to fund government
was not happening just in Ferguson,

246
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,000
as a recent study
of the surrounding area showed.

247
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,840
According to court records,
8 towns rely on court fines and fees

248
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,040
for more than 30 percent
of their revenue.

249
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,760
Calverton Park
is at the 66 percent level.

250
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,440
66 percent ! When that much
of your budget comes from fines,

251
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,600
you're actually rooting
for people to break the law.

252
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,120
"We're gonna have to close the library
unless someone urinates up that wall

253
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,200
and the rest of us
start driving like maniacs.

254
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,320
So put the pedal to the metal.
Let's do it for the kids !"

255
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,240
In these situations,
the poor get hurt the worst.

256
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,920
In many states,
failure to pay a fine on time

257
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,240
can even result in having
your driving license suspended.

258
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,560
In fact,
this is such a common practice,

259
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,920
in Orange County, Florida,
they made an event out of it.

260
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,040
The Grinch himself
showed up in Orange County

261
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,840
with a bag full of licenses
belonging to drivers

262
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,880
who've been more naughty
than nice.

263
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,840
If you're gonna drive in a manner
that affects somebody else's safety,

264
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,200
that we're gonna impact your life.

265
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,080
You do know the Grinch
is the bad guy in that story, right ?

266
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,720
It's not about a brave green
crime-fighter who saves Whoville

267
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,120
from a guy driving his sleigh
ten miles over the speed limit.

268
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,680
Grinch's argument that this was about
affecting people's lives and safety

269
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,160
was somewhat undercut
a little later in the same report.

270
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,720
Many of these licenses
were suspended

271
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,560
because the drivers
didn't pay a traffic ticket.

272
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,840
Those licenses weren't all taken
from reckless drivers.

273
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,360
The odds are, they were mostly
taken from insolvent drivers.

274
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,200
In 2012 in Florida, a staggering 88%
of all license suspensions

275
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,440
were due to "failure to comply
with summons or fines."

276
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:32,160
It also leaves only 12% for Florida's
other most common violations:

277
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,160
accidentally taking your golf cart
on the freeway,

278
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,880
feeding meth to an alligator,
feeding an alligator to a meth dealer,

279
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,680
and being an alligator meth dealer.

280
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,200
Florida. The problem is,

281
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,240
if you do lose your license,
it can affect everything.

282
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,680
Most Americans drive to work. If you
can't do that, you've got a problem.

283
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,040
In New Jersey, a survey of low-income
drivers who'd had license suspended

284
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,280
found that 64 percent
had lost their jobs as a result.

285
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,760
Which doesn't help anyone.
You need them to pay their fine,

286
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,560
but you're taking away
their means of paying it.

287
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,200
That's the most self-defeating idea
since gay conversion camp.

288
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,040
"Don't worry, boys, we'll fix you.
It's swimming in the morning,

289
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,800
wrestling in the afternoon,
and in the evening,

290
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,200
general horseplay in the woods.
You'll be fine, chaps."

291
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,360
Let's recap: if you get a ticket
and you can't pay it,

292
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,600
you may get additional fines, lose
your license, and eventually your job.

293
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,960
If you're thinking, "is any way this
situation can be made even worse ?"

294
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,520
Relax: there is.

295
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,080
Now private companies have managed
somehow to insert themselves.

296
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,160
Private probation companies
across the US

297
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,520
supervise people who are on probation
for minor offenses,

298
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,200
collect all of their outstanding debts
and fines and court costs,

299
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,560
and they won't charge the courts
a penny.

300
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,520
Instead, probationers pay them fees
in exchange for their services.

301
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,120
Yes, Judicial Correction Services
and Sentinel Offender Services

302
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,240
offer to supervise probationers
and collect fees at no cost.

303
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,080
They even market themselves
with ads like this one, for JCS,

304
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,200
trumpeting the millions of dollars
they collected for municipalities.

305
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,280
The problem is,
that money is a lot like Wendy's chili:

306
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,480
it's fantastic to have, as long as you
don't think about where it came from.

307
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,480
Because it can come
from people like Hali Woods.

308
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,920
August of last year,
I got a no seat-belt ticket.

309
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,080
How much was that ticket for ?

310
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,880
The ticket was $25 and court
costs was $16 which was $41.

311
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,600
I didn't have the money to pay
so they put me on JCS probation.

312
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,040
Hali was handed over to JCS probation
because she couldn't pay a $41 ticket.

313
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,280
They put her on a payment plan
with a monthly fee of $35.

314
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,400
The problem for Hali was,
any money she sent in

315
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,440
was applied to her JCS fees first
and not her $41 ticket.

316
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,320
Which put her
in a hamster wheel of hell.

317
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,880
This one right here shows
I paid another $10.

318
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,960
It shows that the fees went down
but the fine is still $41.

319
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,680
I've told the judge that I have
the money to pay for the ticket,

320
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,880
I couldn't afford the rest of the fees,
he said that that wasn't his problem,

321
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,920
that I could just put
that $41 towards the probation.

322
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,640
And then I got another
one that shows I paid $41 even

323
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,560
and the fine has not been touched not
one time in all the money I've paid.

324
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,600
So if you have money, the state's
slogan is "click it or ticket,"

325
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,520
but it should really be "buckle
yourself or go fuckle yourself."

326
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,480
In case you are somehow
not angry enough by now,

327
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,560
remember how the system
works if you do have money !

328
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,320
- My headlights weren't on.
- Let me explain it, okay ?

329
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,880
I totally get it. It's a ticket,
I need to pay it, I'm late.

330
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,640
You didn't think it was possible
to dislike her any more, did you ?

331
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,560
"Amber, you're back on TV,
this is sick."

332
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,400
It's not that these private probation
companies can take your money.

333
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,240
Their recommendations to the court
can ultimately send you to jail.

334
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,520
Take the case of Tom Barrett. He's
a veteran who stole a $2 can of beer,

335
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,760
which he knows
he should not have done.

336
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,160
When he couldn't pay his fine, he was
referred to Sentinel Offender Services.

337
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,400
In addition to all their other fees,
they gave a court-ordered leg monitor,

338
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,800
for which they charged him
$360 a month, $12 a day.

339
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,080
To keep up on his payments,
he had to start selling his own plasma.

340
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,440
And where do you think
this story ended ?

341
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,600
I ended up having to walk everywhere
because I couldn't afford bus fare.

342
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,000
I went hungry
because I couldn't afford food.

343
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,960
It was $12 a day and there was
no way I could make $12

344
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,840
so I was always falling behind.

345
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,920
I ended up getting locked up 3 times
over stealing this can of beer.

346
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,240
Locked up three times
over stealing one can of beer.

347
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,280
That is not justice, that's the plot
of a southern Les Miserables.

348
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,760
"I dreamed a dream
I stole a Coors

349
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,840
and then some assholes
put me in jaaaail..."

350
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,400
The crazy thing is,
the most insane part of this is,

351
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,560
the main reason municipalities
sign contracts with these companies

352
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,800
is to save money.

353
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,680
This whole system doesn't even
make sense on a financial basis.

354
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,080
As Tom Barrett's lawyer explains,
locking him up was expensive.

355
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,600
I know the jailing costs $50 a day
and I think he was probably in jail

356
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,560
for at least 60 days or 70 days
so probably over $3,500.

357
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,680
Think about that: a $2 can of beer
caused a $270 fine,

358
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,320
which the city spent
over $3,000 to try and enforce.

359
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,840
It's like they say: "you gotta
spend money to make money

360
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,840
to be able to afford
to jail people to lose money."

361
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,920
This brings us right back to where
we began, with Harriet Cleveland,

362
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,920
because her story touches on pretty
much everything we've seen so far.

363
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,800
How did Harriet wind up in jail ?
She struggled to pay traffic tickets,

364
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,640
had her license suspended, had
to keep driving or she'd lose her job,

365
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,000
was then caught driving
without a license, ticketed again,

366
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,320
and then had her fines handed
over to the good people at JCS.

367
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,840
I'll let her pick up
the story up from there.

368
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,760
I lost a whole lot of money paying
to them that didn't go onto my fine.

369
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,680
I lost my car trying to pay them.

370
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,600
I did a title loan on my car
and lost that.

371
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,120
And trying to pay my utility bills,
they getting shut off here and there.

372
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,040
I wanted to pay my fine
but I couldn't afford it.

373
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,920
It hurt real hard
and I didn't even have that

374
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,680
but I had to take something until
it got to the point I just got tired.

375
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:16,960
I paid them $2,000 one time,
and that was in February.

376
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,200
In March I didn't have them
anything else to give them.

377
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:27,760
Southern Poverty Law Center managed
to get her out of jail after 10 days,

378
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,840
arguing that she'd been sent to what
was effectively a debtor's prison,

379
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:36,120
something that was supposed to have
been outlawed in America in the 1830s.

380
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,240
Whether through private probation
or just the states,

381
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,360
many people are caught in the same
cycle as all the people that we've seen.

382
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,280
No one is saying that people who break
the law should not be punished.

383
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,440
This isn't about being soft
on crime.

384
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,760
Listen to Tom Barrett's self-proclaimed
conservative Republican lawyer !

385
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,520
If someone violates the rules
of society they need to be punished.

386
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,000
The punishment needs to have some,
if it's gonna be based on a fine,

387
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,960
it has to be based
on the person's ability to pay.

388
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,280
If they don't have the ability to pay,
they can have community service.

389
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,280
Not only should municipalities not
be balancing their books

390
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,480
on the backs of some
of their most vulnerable citizens,

391
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,040
but we cannot have a system
where committing a minor violation

392
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,920
can end up putting you in, and I'm
going to use a legal term of art here,

393
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,280
the fuck barrel.

394
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,600
We can't have that. It might be time
that we all stood up and said so.

395
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,440
- I'm a hostess.
- I'm a barista.

396
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,320
- I'm a cashier.
- I'm a utility inspector.

397
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,960
- I am a hair stylist.
- I'm a janitor and cook.

398
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,800
We're all Americans
and we have the right

399
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,520
to life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness.

400
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,160
But sometimes in that pursuit,
we also need the right

401
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,440
to fuck up once in a while, without
it completely destroying our lives.

402
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,720
- I've jaywalked before.
- I have gotten a speeding ticket.

403
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,480
I've publicly urinated
maybe once or twice.

404
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,120
Public drunkenness.

405
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,440
Of course your boy
been drunk in public !

406
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,280
- Got ticket for spitting on the floor.
- I got a ticket for petty loitering.

407
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,120
I got arrested for smoking weed
at a concert

408
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,160
and then I met GZA and he gave me
a VIP pass back into the concert.

409
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,720
- So thank you GZA.
- Yes, thank you GZA.

410
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,480
When we've truly made a mistake,
we're all willing to pay a price.

411
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,760
But that price should be
reasonable and private companies

412
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,440
should not be profiting
from someone's inability to pay.

413
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,120
One time,
I put a popsicle in my friend's ass.

414
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,320
That doesn't apply to the subject
about here but thanks for sharing ?

415
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,160
The point is,
this is everyone's problem.

416
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,320
Young, old, black, white,
it's not about race.

417
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,280
- It's definitely about race.
- Race definitely plays into it.

418
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,640
I highly doubt
that loitering thing I got,

419
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,840
would've happened to me if I was,
forget about me being white,

420
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,880
if I was like
a couple of shades lighter.

421
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:10,000
It's absolutely about race as well
but it's also about basic fairness.

422
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,600
And it has to stop.

423
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,960
People cannot end up in a fuck barrel
for the little stuff we all do.

424
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,280
So it's time for us all
to come together and say as one...

425
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,600
Shut down the fuck barrel.

426
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,640
Shut down the fuck barrel.

427
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,720
- I said, shut down the fuck barrel.
- Please !

428
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,600
Yes, shut down the fuck barrel.
Shut it down.

429
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,040
That's our show. Thank you so much !
We'll see you in two weeks !

430
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,040
END OF EPISODE 7,
SEASON II
