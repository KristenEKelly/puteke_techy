00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,000
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
with John Oliver

2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,640
EPISODE 22

3
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,720
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,400
I'm John Oliver. Thank you
so much for joining us.

5
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,560
Just time for a quick
recap of the week,

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,800
and we begin with diplomacy...
war for pussies.

7
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,440
Last week, Iran
and the US reached

8
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,640
a historic
nuclear agreement.

9
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,680
And this week,
the Obama administration

10
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,040
began its effort to sell
that deal back home.

11
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,480
And judging by Thursday's
congressional hearing,

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,400
they may have
an uphill battle.

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,680
Convince me that what we're going
through isn't just a big charade.

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,840
With all due respect,
you guys have been bamboozled.

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,720
Not unlike a hotel guest
that leaves

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,200
only with a hotel bathrobe
on his back,

17
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,640
I believe
you've been fleeced.

18
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,480
What ?

19
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,560
That last one doesn't
even make sense.

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,840
If... If you've ever
stayed in a hotel,

21
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,920
you know if you get out of there
with a free bathrobe,

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,120
I don't care what
you gave up to get it,

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,760
that's a good deal.

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,400
That's... They are soft.
Those things are soft.

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,560
It's like being inside
a monogrammed sheep.

26
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,920
This... This is
the beginning of 60 days

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,600
of congressional review. And strap in,
because it could be

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,400
a rough two months ahead.

29
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,400
One group opposing the deal
is reportedly spending

30
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,520
as much as 40$ million
campaigning against it,

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,440
including ads like this one.

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,920
Restrictions end
after ten years.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,720
Then Iran could build
a nuclear weapon in two months.

34
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,920
Congress should
reject a bad deal.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,160
We need a better deal.

36
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,760
Oh, a better deal.

37
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,840
Of cour... Why didn't
John Kerry think of that ?

38
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,040
In fact, why stop there ?

39
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,880
Why not get an even better deal
while you're at it ?

40
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,080
Or even ask for the best deal,
plus 100 $ and a free hotel bathrobe.

41
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,840
That's how diplomacy works, right ? You
just ask for it and they give it to you.

42
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,960
That's my understanding.

43
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,960
So, it seems pretty clear
the Obama administration

44
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,840
has its work cut out for it.

45
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,880
So, what are they doing to compete
with that 40$ million war chest ?

46
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,920
They've actually launched
this Twitter handle

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,920
called "@TheIranDeal."

48
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,160
The whole goal here
really is "Come at me.

49
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,320
"If you want any questions
about this deal,

50
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,400
If you're a naysayer,
make sure to tweet us,

51
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,720
because we will
get the facts straight."

52
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,120
That's right.

53
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,880
The administration is fighting back
with a Twitter account.

54
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,200
And to be fair, it was going pretty well
for a day or so,

55
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,240
until @TheIranDeal got into a feud
with Taylor Swift and Nicki Minaj.

56
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,560
Taylor was like,

57
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,320
"@TheIranDeal allows Iran to keep
one-third of its 19.000 centrifuges."

58
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,560
And Nicki was like,

59
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,440
"How do we know @TheIranDeal
will ensure Iran keeps uranium

60
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,240
or refinements
at five percent ?"

61
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,920
Then @TheIranDeal was like,

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,040
"WTF. Ladies, I've done nothing
but love and support you."

63
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,520
And then it was on.

64
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,600
It was on !

65
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,600
The point is, Twitter is not
the place for this shit,

66
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,080
and it's gonna be
a long 60 days.

67
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,160
So, let's move on to FIFA,

68
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,720
um, an international
crime syndicate

69
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,680
that occasionally
organizes soccer matches.

70
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,760
As we have amply
covered on this show,

71
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,320
FIFA and its head, Sepp Blatter,
have been engulfed

72
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,040
in allegations of corruption.

73
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,800
Blatter has been trying
to clean up his image of late,

74
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,560
and this week, he was in Russia,
preparing for the 2018 World Cup,

75
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,320
where he uttered words
no human has ever said before.

76
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,960
First of all, I have to say,
thank you, President Putin.

77
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,600
You make us happy
and comfortable.

78
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,160
Thank you so much.

79
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,640
That's never happened !

80
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,680
Also, I'm honestly surprised

81
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,600
that they were able
to touch each other

82
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,920
without instantly creating
a vortex of concentrated evil

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,720
that sucked all of humanity

84
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,600
into a gaping maw
of eternal darkness.

85
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,480
And... And I have to say,
shaking hands with Putin

86
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,760
when you may be
facing corruption...

87
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,480
uh, corruption charges,

88
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,480
bespeaks a much larger problem
for FIFA's top brass,

89
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,120
because sometimes, it seems,

90
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,080
they honestly may not know
how bad their actions look.

91
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,840
Take former FIFA
vice president Jeffrey Webb,

92
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,440
who just last week faced charges
of accepting bribes

93
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,600
worth millions of dollars.
He plead not guilty

94
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,720
and was released
on 10$ million bail.

95
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,040
But wait, just wait until you see
how he came up with it.

96
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,200
He provided a Ferrari,
ten properties,

97
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,480
and five Rolex watches
to secure his release on bail.

98
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,520
A Ferrari and five Rolexes.

99
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
That does not look great when
you're fighting corruption charges.

100
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,160
His bail was apparently set
at one midlife crises.

101
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,920
But there is nothing
that is likely to be worrying FIFA more

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,640
at the moment than the potential loss
of the thing most precious to them.

103
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,840
FIFA admits it is having
trouble getting new sponsors,

104
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,480
and the ones it already has,
well, they want a meeting.

105
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,200
The CEO of Visa called FIFA's
response

106
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,320
to the scandal
"wholly inadequate."

107
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,840
A few hours ago,
Budweiser's parent company,

108
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,720
InBev, joined that call.

109
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,440
Also, McDonald's,
another huge sponsor,

110
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,280
said it is not satisfied,
and will not be

111
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,320
without the transparency
of an independent commission.

112
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,720
Wow !

113
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,040
You know your organization
is in trouble

114
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,080
when McDonald's says
it is not satisfied.

115
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,480
This... This is coming
from the maker

116
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
of grayish brown
meat circles,

117
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,000
tiny condensed
chicken mistakes,

118
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,760
and, once a year,
the Shamrock Shake,

119
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,800
a.k.a.
a leprechaun's diarrhea.

120
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,000
And lastly... Moving on.

121
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,720
Lastly this week,
let's look at Canada,

122
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,880
the country
with a thriving economy

123
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,160
based on making
jean jackets for geese

124
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,600
and... and of course, their booming
sexy Ryan manufacturing industry.

125
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,160
This past week,
saw bad news for one company

126
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,840
that you maybe didn't
even realize was Canadian.

127
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,400
A website that encourages people
to cheat on their partners

128
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,840
is reeling
from a huge data breach.

129
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,680
AshleyMadison.com executives
confirmed this morning

130
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,040
that their website
has been hacked.

131
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,080
And the group
claiming responsibility

132
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,440
is threatening to release
the personal information

133
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,960
of the website's
millions of users.

134
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,840
Ashley Madison's slogan
is "Life is short. Have an affair."

135
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,640
"Life is short.
Have an affair."

136
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,120
That is the most morally
dubious slogan

137
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,560
since Toyota's short-lived "Feeling
bored ? Hit someone with your car."

138
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,720
Now the fact... the fact
that AshleyMadison.com

139
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,880
has been hacked is a crime,
but it is hard to feel too bad

140
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,840
for a company that has
willingly run this ad...

141
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,200
I'm looking for someone
other than my wife

142
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,840
Other than my wife

143
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,520
Ashley Madison is right

144
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,480
I'm looking for someone
other than my wife

145
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,920
Other than my wife

146
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,600
Ashley Madison is right

147
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,400
I'm looking for someone
other than my wife

148
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,880
Other than my wife

149
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,520
Ashley Madison is right

150
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,520
That is the catchiest song

151
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,680
about being a complete monster
I've ever heard,

152
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,000
and... and I'm including
"Monster Mash" in that.

153
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,200
Also, also, I must say,
it seems like the theme there

154
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,600
is essentially
go to Ashley Madison,

155
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,560
and you will meet
nothing but other dudes.

156
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,720
That... That seems
to be the implication.

157
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,520
Now, interestingly,
this story may be bad news

158
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,240
for one city in particular...
Canada's capital, Ottawa,

159
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,080
a town known by locals as
the city that fun forgot,

160
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,120
and which once genuinely
adopted the slogan

161
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,520
"Technically beautiful."

162
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,880
It turns out that Ottawans may
be surprisingly invested in this story.

163
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,160
According to the site, almost 190.000
people in Ottawa are subscribers.

164
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,880
190.000 ?!
If that was somehow true,

165
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,720
that is one in five
people in Ottawa.

166
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,040
That's half the married
population there.

167
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,520
So, if you live in Ottawa,
look to your left,

168
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,760
look to your right...
both of those people

169
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,440
are on AshleyMadison.com,
and so are you !

170
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,360
That's a fact !

171
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,880
Look, look, the important
thing is here...

172
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,200
Let... Let me speak to Ottawa.

173
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,440
Ottawa, you cannot let this skeezy
website destroy your marriages.

174
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,560
Don't take this lying down

175
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,800
beneath some mulleted stranger
wearing a wedding band.

176
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,680
The city counselor of Ottawa
needs to fight back,

177
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,520
and perhaps, we can help.

178
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,840
Attention, people of Ottawa,
we need to talk.

179
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,280
Lumberjacks,
turn off your chainsaws.

180
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,280
Hockey players, stop skating
for a second, boys.

181
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,880
Moose, you just keep on moosin'.
This doesn't concern you.

182
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,880
This is for
the married people of Ottawa.

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,560
Sitting at home, thinking
about having an affair ?

184
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,680
Don't.

185
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,120
There's a simple cure
for the marriage blues.

186
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,160
I'm talking about
the beautiful city of Ottawa...

187
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,000
the Canadian capital
of romance.

188
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,760
Go take a sexy walk together
by the Parliament buildings,

189
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,640
surprise your spouse
by knowing the clock tower

190
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,400
contains 53 bells, eh ?

191
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,520
And also, by performing cunnilingus
without being asked.

192
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,080
Just go down.

193
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,760
Maybe take a stroll together
down the Rideau Canal ?

194
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,080
Did you know that in winter it becomes
the world's largest skating pond ?

195
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,880
If that don't get you hard
or wet, nothing will, eh ?

196
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,640
Or maybe take your spouse to
the annual balloon festival.

197
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,000
You can point out the one
that looks like a tortoise,

198
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,520
and then fingerbang each other
in the car park.

199
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,480
Come on, eh ?
Look how beautiful this city is.

200
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,440
I mean, okay,
this is footage of Paris,

201
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,800
but you can think about it
while you're living here...

202
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,600
in Ottawa.

203
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,520
Okay, look, we get it.

204
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,240
Ottawa is a depressing,
frigid shit-hole,

205
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,680
and always has been.

206
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,320
But having an affair
is downright un-Canadian.

207
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,160
And you think Mounties have affairs ?
Not in those hats.

208
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,320
So, in conclusion,
don't have sex

209
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,160
with someone else's
husband named Gordon.

210
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,640
Have sex with your own
husband called Gordon,

211
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,800
because Ottawa is not
about getting

212
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,400
your sweet, sweet,
extramarital fuck on.

213
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,440
Ottawa is about watching your life
float by like so much dirty river ice.

214
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,240
Ottawa... a perfectly decent
place to fuck your own spouse.

215
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,720
Moving on.
Let's move on.

216
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,000
Now, the last few weeks
have been extremely busy

217
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,640
from the Iran Deal,
to Greece's economic meltdown,

218
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,600
to Donald Trump saying...

219
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,720
Who gives a shit
about what he says ?

220
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,360
It doesn't matter. But...
But in all the excitement,

221
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,520
you may have missed
one piece of news

222
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,160
that got lost in the shuffle.

223
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,240
President Obama tonight
granting clemency

224
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,480
to 46 non-violent
drug offenders...

225
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,320
the most in one day
since the 1960s.

226
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,680
Now, that's fantastic...
giving nearly four-dozen prisoners,

227
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,280
who had made mistakes,
a second chance at life.

228
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,560
It's basically
the criminal justice version

229
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,840
of "Top Chef's
Last Chance Kitchen,"

230
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,440
but with a chance
to walk free as the reward

231
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,840
rather than the opportunity
to, once again,

232
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,520
disappoint Padma
with your risotto.

233
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,560
This brings President Obama's
total commutations to 89,

234
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,640
and that's just
counting the humans.

235
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,280
Today, I have the awesome
responsibility of granting

236
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,960
a presidential pardon
to a pair of turkeys.

237
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,040
You are hereby pardoned...

238
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,320
uh, from the Thanksgiving
dinner table.

239
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,280
Uh, may you have
a wonderful, uh...

240
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,680
and joyful life
at Mount Vernon.

241
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,720
Just look
at that turkey's face.

242
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,000
Even he thinks the Annual
Turkey Pardoning is pathetic.

243
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,200
Look at him.
"Ugh, just kill me.

244
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,360
This is the worst thing
that happened to me today,

245
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,800
and you just
deep-fried my cousin."

246
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,400
Presidential clemency
has always been controversial,

247
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,480
from George W. Bush commuting
Scooter Libby's sentence,

248
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,360
to Bill Clinton pardoning
financier Mark Rich,

249
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,160
to... and this is true...
Abraham Lincoln pardoning

250
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,760
a man convicted
of attempted bestiality

251
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,720
because the man was
intoxicated at the time.

252
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,000
The man in question,
John Wilkes Booth.

253
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,400
It's true.

254
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,520
Actually not true. But if it had been,
that would have been amazing, right ?

255
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,400
It would've been...
it would've been amazing.

256
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,960
And you can read
more stuff like that in my book,

257
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,880
"Stranger than Truth:
John Oliver's Favorite History Lies."

258
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,160
But the point is,
the president commuting

259
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,560
these people's sentences
is a big deal

260
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,040
because they'd all been
subjected to mandatory

261
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,880
minimum sentencing laws,
which is our topic tonight.

262
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,320
Mandatory minimums require judges
to punish certain crimes

263
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,520
with a minimum
number of years in prison

264
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,360
regardless of context,
which is a little strange

265
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,400
because context is important.

266
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,080
For instance,
like shouting the phrase

267
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,800
"I'm coming !" is fine
when catching a bus,

268
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,680
but not okay when
you're already on the bus.

269
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,320
So, circumstances
make a huge difference.

270
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,480
That's what I'm trying to say.

271
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,880
Now, our current
mandatory minimums

272
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,560
were mostly passed during
the tough-on-crime era

273
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,720
of the 1980s and 90's,
and they're partially

274
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,960
responsible for the explosion
of our prison population.

275
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,000
Since 1980, the prison population
has more than quadrupled.

276
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,680
To put that into perspective,

277
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,840
that means one out of
every 100 adults is locked up.

278
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,840
That's true. We have two million
people incarcerated.

279
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,160
If we keep going
in this direction,

280
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,240
we'll soon have enough to populate an
entire new country with prisoners,

281
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,680
and trust me when I say
that is not a good idea.

282
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,080
Literally, the only good thing
to come out of that experiment

283
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,640
was Hugh Jackman,
and that took 180 years.

284
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,000
It was worth it,
but it was a long time.

285
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,480
But it was worth it.
It was worth it.

286
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,480
But that's... two centuries.
But it was...

287
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,680
It was worth it, but...

288
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,400
Mandatory minimums
have had a real human cost.

289
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,720
Meet one prisoner currently
serving time in Oklahoma.

290
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,800
My name is Kevin Ott.

291
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,480
My number's 203093.

292
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,520
I'm in here for
trafficking methamphetamine.

293
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,200
I start my 14th year
in just a couple of months,

294
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,320
and I will be here
until I die. Yeah.

295
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,880
I have life without parole for
three ounces of methamphetamine.

296
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,480
He got a life sentence
for three ounces of meth.

297
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,960
That is insane.

298
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,960
They're treating him like
he's Season Five Walter White

299
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,200
when he's barely
Episode One Jesse Pinkman.

300
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,640
Now, most of the mandatory
minimum drug laws on the books

301
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,200
were written in the 80's
and 90's when America was

302
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,280
in the grips of a full-fledged
antidrug hysteria.

303
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,360
It was a time when you could turn on
your TV and see this...

304
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,000
This is crack.

305
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,440
Rock cocaine.

306
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,200
It isn't glamorous
or cool or kids' stuff.

307
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,600
Little kids doing drugs...
it turns my stomach.

308
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,920
It's... it's me !

309
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,880
This is my future ?

310
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,200
It is if you don't
get off those drugs !

311
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,080
You use, you lose !

312
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,400
Listen to us !
We care about you, Mikey !

313
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,480
There's nothing cool
about a fool on drugs !

314
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,360
That... That last one,
you have to hand it to it,

315
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,400
had a clear message to kids.
"Listen, if you do drugs,

316
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,160
all your favorite cartoon characters
will show up and talk to you.

317
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,080
Is that what you want ?
Is that what you want ?"

318
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,800
So, suffice the perceived
drug menace, Ronald Reagan,

319
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,520
passed tough mandatory
minimum drug penalties.

320
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,680
And his successor
pushed for even harsher laws,

321
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,080
justifying them
in an Oval Office speech

322
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,440
featuring this
spectacular moment.

323
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,640
This is crack cocaine,
seized a few days ago

324
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,560
by drug enforcement agents
in a park

325
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,080
just across the street
from the White House.

326
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,760
It could easily have been
heroin or PCP.

327
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,440
It's as innocent-looking
as candy.

328
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,720
"And now, with the help
of this bag's contents,

329
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,640
I shall ascend into the cosmos
on the wings of a dragon

330
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,800
"to a place where joy is everlasting
and fear is but a memory.

331
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,520
Let's do this thing !

332
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,880
Let's do this thing, y'all !

333
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,200
Whoo ! Where's Kermit ?"

334
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,240
And, look...
Fun sidenote here.

335
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,080
If you are wondering why
someone was dealing drugs

336
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,560
in front of the White House,
it later emerged

337
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,600
the administration asked
the DEA to relocate

338
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,720
a previously arranged
drug sting

339
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,800
to make that line
in the president's speech true.

340
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,480
The DEA obligingly agreed
to move the buy

341
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,680
a little closer
to the White House.

342
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,920
The only hang-up was
that apparently

343
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,280
the teenage drug dealer
didn't know exactly

344
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,200
where the White House was.

345
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,360
Now, yeah, it's sad that a teenager
got caught up in that sting,

346
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,240
but that is an unbeatable
prison yard story.

347
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,760
"Oh, that's an amazing breaking-
and-entering anecdote you have.

348
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,160
Did I tell you about the time I sold
crack to the president of the U.S ?"

349
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,640
And this was by no means
just a Republican issue.

350
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,160
Democrats in Congress,
state legislatures,

351
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,760
and even Bill Clinton
also pushed for these laws,

352
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,000
and by early 1994,
31 states and DC

353
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,040
had mandatory minimum
sentences for drug offenses.

354
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,920
They united people
from either side of the aisle

355
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,760
faster than playing
the "chicken dance" at a wedding.

356
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,920
And that... that is guaranteed
to work every time.

357
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,360
"This is one
your Aunty knows !"

358
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,880
But... But nowadays, that bipartisan
tide has very much turned.

359
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,240
Everyone from the president
to Ted Cruz has spoken out

360
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,200
against mandatory minimums,
and earlier this year,

361
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,520
a bipartisan group
of legislators introduced

362
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,400
a bill to curve them
with this striking statement.

363
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,520
Let me just start off with a challenge
to the press, everyone at attendance.

364
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,160
Try to find a more diverse
political group gathered

365
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,120
in one place in the history
of the United States Congress.

366
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,800
"In fact, I challenge you
to find any group as diverse

367
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,560
as the eight men
standing before you.

368
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,320
I cannot think of anyone
who is not represented here.

369
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,680
I challenge you.
You are challenged."

370
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,280
In fact, even people who helped
write those laws at the time,

371
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,600
have turned on them.
Take Kevin Ring.

372
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,880
He was a congressional staffer
who helped push

373
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,720
mandatory minimums
in the 90's

374
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,480
because he believed that they were
an effective deterrent.

375
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,600
He later went
to prison for fraud,

376
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,920
and meeting his fellow inmates
somewhat changed his mind.

377
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,840
Most of these guys
made stupid mistakes

378
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,040
without any idea
of what the punishment was.

379
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,800
They just didn't think
they were going to get caught.

380
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,480
Um, so you can... you can make
the severity off the charts.

381
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,680
You can... you can do
life sentence for jaywalking.

382
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,120
It's not gonna stop it.

383
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,520
Of course it isn't.

384
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,880
Ridiculously long sentences are not
a great deterrent to crime.

385
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,240
Prison sentences
are a lot like penises.

386
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,680
If they're used correctly,
even a short one

387
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,600
can do the trick...

388
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,680
...is a rumor I have heard.

389
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,640
And the truth is...

390
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,920
The truth is,
mandatory minimums...

391
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,240
mandatory minimums
didn't just not work,

392
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,040
they ruined lives.

393
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,000
Take the case
of Weldon Angelos,

394
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,200
a non-violent,
first-time offender.

395
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,760
When he was 24, he sold small amounts
of marijuana to an informant

396
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,320
while he happened to have
a gun in his possession.

397
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,040
And as a result, he received
a 55-year mandatory minimum

398
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,280
sentence with no parole.
He won't get out until he's 79

399
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,400
for selling something
that's currently legal

400
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,520
for recreational use
in four states,

401
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,280
and whose main side effect

402
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,520
is making episodes
of "Frasier" slightly funnier.

403
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,320
And... And he was not the only one
affected by his sentence.

404
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,560
His two boys
were five and seven.

405
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,200
They were just destroyed.

406
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,680
I mean, you could see
the sadness in them all the time.

407
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,720
I think it's cruel and...

408
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,800
like, I'm not saying
he doesn't deserve anything,

409
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,120
but he did serve his time, and...
I think he's in there long enough.

410
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,920
Like, the minimum should've
been, like, five years, maybe.

411
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,200
55 years is way too much.

412
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,960
Yeah, it is.
It is way too much.

413
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,160
And you know
who else thinks that ?

414
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,080
The judge who sentenced him.

415
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,920
If he had been
an aircraft hijacker,

416
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,200
he would've gotten
24 years in prison.

417
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,400
If he had been a terrorist, he would've
gotten 20 years in prison.

418
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,480
If he was a child rapist, he would've
gotten 11 years in prison.

419
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,040
And now I'm supposed to
give him a 55-year sentence ?

420
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,480
That's just not right.

421
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,920
So wait, if my math is right here,
this low-level pot dealer

422
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,440
received the exact
same sentence

423
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,240
as would an airplane-hijacking,
child-raping terrorist...

424
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,000
a person so evil,

425
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,240
I legitimately don't know
if one has ever existed.

426
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,680
And he's not alone.

427
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,000
Many judges... Many judges
oppose mandatory minimums

428
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,920
because they essentially
hand over sentencing power

429
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,440
to prosecutors who can
then use the threat

430
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,440
of long mandatory minimums
to convince defendants

431
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,720
to take a plea bargain or to cooperate
by providing information.

432
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,720
And we have all seen this
in action on cop shows.

433
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,280
That heroin we found
in your apartment,

434
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,320
that kind of weight...
gotta take that to federal court.

435
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,160
Mandatory minimum sentence
you're looking at is ten years.

436
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,760
See, we're giving you a choice here,
Jimmy. You do the ten years

437
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,760
or you help us on these homicides
we're looking at.

438
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,800
"Yeah, and you know what ? Don't help
us out too quickly either, Jimmy.

439
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,840
We've got 23 minutes left in this
episode, so you're gonna want

440
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,480
to reveal that relevant information
in a nice, piecemeal fashion."

441
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,680
And, look, drugs
have hurt people, for sure,

442
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,120
but the mandatory minimum
sentencing laws designed to stop them

443
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,280
have done way more harm
than good,

444
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,800
particularly to
certain populations.

445
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,360
In 2010, nearly three-quarters
of federal drug offenders

446
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,840
sentenced under mandatory
minimums were black or Hispanic.

447
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,560
They affect minorities the way that
hockey injuries affect white people...

448
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,720
not entirely,
but disproportionately.

449
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,880
Now... Now luckily,
at the federal level,

450
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,240
we've reduced
some mandatory minimums

451
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,280
and added safety-valve
provisions to give judges

452
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,040
discretion in certain cases.

453
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,480
And on the local level,
at least 29 states

454
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,160
have rolled back
their mandatory minimum laws.

455
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,000
But for the most part, those reforms
have not been made retroactive,

456
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,400
meaning thousands of people
are currently stuck in prison

457
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,320
for crimes that would
carry far shorter sentences

458
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,120
if they had committed them
just a few years later.

459
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,080
And that's... that's terrible.

460
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,400
Just think about
how annoyed you get

461
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,560
when people who get seated
after you at a restaurant

462
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,800
get served
and leave before you.

463
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,120
Only, in this case,
the food is prison food,

464
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,440
the restaurant is prison,
and dinner takes 55 fucking years.

465
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,120
And the thing is,
if we go back...

466
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,040
if we go back
and fix these mistakes

467
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,360
while we still can, the effect
can be transformative.

468
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,760
Look at Jason Hernandez,
who was sentenced to life in prison

469
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,880
for dealing drugs,
including crack.

470
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,960
Watch him read his commutation
from the president.

471
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,520
"Be it known that I,
Barack Obama,

472
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,560
President of
the United States of America,

473
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,200
in consideration of the...

474
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,680
of the premises
there is other good...

475
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,600
and sufficient reasons
be there are to move it...

476
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,960
do hereby grant the sent...

477
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,960
the sent application..."

478
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,120
Let me tell you
just how moving that is.

479
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,520
I'm moved by it
and I'm British.

480
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,960
And we are so repressed
that crying in public

481
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,600
is punishable by exile
from the country.

482
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,880
I'm only here
because I saw the trailer

483
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,240
for "The Notebook"
in the theater.

484
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,320
He wrote her every day
for a year !

485
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,680
Every day for a year !

486
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,320
Their first love
was their greatest love !

487
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,600
There are so many people who
deserve to have their cases addressed.

488
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,160
Here is just one more.

489
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,160
Sharanda Jones, a first-time
non-violent offender.

490
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,240
She was sentenced to life for her very
minor part in a crack cocaine ring.

491
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,000
She had an eight-year-old daughter
when she went to prison,

492
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,880
and has had to watch her grow up
from inside there.

493
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,800
My dream is to just
show up at her school.

494
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,600
I mean, I know
they gave me life,

495
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,880
but I can't imagine
not being at her graduation.

496
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,760
Her high school graduation... I just
can't imagine me not being there.

497
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,120
Here's the thing...
that was eight years ago,

498
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,080
and she missed
that graduation.

499
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,840
And Sharanda was not
on the president's list

500
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,800
of commutations last week,
nor incidentally, was Weldon Angelos.

501
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,880
As for Kevin Ott, he couldn't be on the
list because he's in a state facility,

502
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,000
so, his pardon would need to come
from the governor of Oklahoma.

503
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,400
And look, there should be
a lot more pardons and commutations.

504
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,840
But if we really want to address
this problem permanently,

505
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,120
we need states
and the federal government

506
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,560
not just to repeal mandatory
minimums going forward,

507
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,440
but to also pass laws
so that existing prisoners

508
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,320
can apply for retroactively
reduced sentences.

509
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,320
Because almost everyone
has agreed that mandatory

510
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,480
minimum laws were a mistake,

511
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,280
and we cannot have a system

512
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,160
where people are continuing
to pay for that mistake

513
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,920
and where, perhaps,
their best chance of getting out

514
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,680
of a prison that they should
no longer be in,

515
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,080
is somehow finding
a turkey costume

516
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,560
and hanging around the fucking
White House at Thanksgiving.

517
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,320
And now, this.

518
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,080
And now...

519
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,560
Unnecessary full disclosure

520
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,360
I'm an oil nerd, by the way.
Full disclosure.

521
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,000
Full disclosure, I am
a huge "Ghostbusters" fan.

522
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,760
Full disclosure, I'm one of those
"born in Massachusetts" guys.

523
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,760
Full disclosure,
I was Hercules.

524
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,160
Full disclosure,
I had to basically wrestle

525
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,120
the hot pants
off my 14-year-old yesterday.

526
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,240
Full disclosure, I live in Brooklyn
and feel youthful most days.

527
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,480
Full disclosure,
I am a Harvard college grad.

528
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,720
Hey, full disclosure
on "Jeopardy," by the way,

529
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,440
you won "Jeopardy" once.

530
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,120
Full disclosure off the top,
I gained six pounds in England.

531
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,560
And finally tonight,
a quick update on Ukraine,

532
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,120
or as Vladamir Putin
might call it, Phase One.

533
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,880
Earlier this week, it seems
Ukraine might be declaring war

534
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,720
on a surprising target.

535
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,600
Gerard Depardieu has become
a persona non grata

536
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,800
in Ukraine, where France
has reported Monday evening

537
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,360
that the actor appears
on the country's recent blacklist

538
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,400
for allegedly posing a threat
to national security.

539
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,640
Yes, reports indicated
Ukraine had blacklisted

540
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,760
Gerard Depardieu,
seen here sweating

541
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,240
an unfeasible amount
of presumably grain alcohol.

542
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,520
Now, subsequently,
it emerged he had not

543
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,440
yet been banned,
but the pro-Ukranian activists

544
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,920
had suggested his name
be added to a blacklist

545
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,360
of foreign cultural figures
who speak out in support

546
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,400
of violating the territorial
integrity of Ukraine.

547
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,680
If you are wondering

548
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,640
what he could possibly have said
to annoy them that much,

549
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,000
well, at a Latvian
film festival last year,

550
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,000
he reportedly said,
and I quote,

551
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,520
"I love Russia and Ukraine,
which is part of Russia."

552
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,160
Which... Which...
let's be fair,

553
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,360
those are pretty
provocative words

554
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,840
from the 104th biggest star
of 102 Dalmatians.

555
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,000
But... let me just
take a moment to issue

556
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,880
a word of caution
to Ukraine,

557
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,280
because some reports
speculated you might ban

558
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,680
the use
of Gerard Depardieu's image,

559
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,560
and that would, frankly, be
a huge mistake, and I'll tell you why.

560
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,760
Photos of him are genuinely

561
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,480
some of the funniest things
on the Planet Earth.

562
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,280
Let me quickly
prove this to you.

563
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,320
Here is one of him driving a scooter
through the countryside.

564
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,040
Just look at that face !
Look how happy he is !

565
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,480
Do not deny
yourself that, Ukraine !

566
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,760
Here's another one of Depardieu
with his nose stuck in a glass of wine.

567
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,760
That is visual Prozac !

568
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,560
And... And this photo
should frankly be painted

569
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,600
on the fucking ceiling
of the Sistine Chapel.

570
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,920
Not only is he spraying
himself with Silly String,

571
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,560
he's staring
down the spray can

572
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,160
like he's somehow confused
by its role in all this.

573
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,760
"I must confess to you,
Monsieur Spray Can,

574
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,320
"I do not know from where
this mysterious

575
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,600
white substance... Oh ! Voila !
It happened again, my dear friend."

576
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,520
Look, Ukraine,
you've had a rough year,

577
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,280
so why deny yourselves
images like this one ?

578
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,800
Of Gerard Depardieu
walking down the street

579
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,640
with two pairs of glasses on his head ?
Why do that to yourself ?

580
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,360
Or a picture of him making
whatever this expression is ?

581
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,120
Is that fear ?
Is it excitement ?

582
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,760
Like any great work of art,
you can see so many things in it.

583
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,760
We did a photo search
for this segment.

584
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,840
We could not find
a bad photo of this man.

585
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,600
We couldn't find a good one either, but
we definitely couldn't find a bad photo.

586
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,400
So, to remind you of what
you might be giving up, Ukraine,

587
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,320
over the credits
of our show tonight,

588
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,240
please enjoy this selection
of Depardieu images

589
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,240
set to the sound
of cartoonishly French music.

590
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,760
That's our show.
Thank you so much for watching.

591
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,800
Thanks to Gerard Depardieu
for living his truth. Good night !

592
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,560
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
with John Oliver

593
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,960
END OF EPISODE 22
