00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,000
LAST WEEK TONIGHT WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,120
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

3
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,040
Thank you for joining us.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,640
Just time for a quick recap
of the week.

5
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,360
And we begin
here in New York with Pride,

6
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,320
the day that makes every color
that's not on the rainbow flag

7
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,800
feel like a worthless sack of shit.

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,960
Now, this year, there was even more
to celebrate than usual.

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,200
Back to the big news of the day...

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,360
the US Supreme Court ruling
five to four

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,240
to legalize same-sex marriage
in the entire country.

12
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,560
That obviously includes the 14 states
where it was against the law.

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,080
Yes ! Finally.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,120
Finally, all across America,
anyone can get married...

15
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,520
anyone except, of course,
for guys who own snakes.

16
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,720
They still can't, but that's on them.

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,800
That's an actual
lifestyle choice, Gary.

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,320
And look, we don't have time
to get into all the responses.

19
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,120
Basically, if you thought
someone would be happy

20
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,480
or angry at the decision,
they probably were.

21
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,120
But the award for greatest moment
in global Pride celebrations

22
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,440
actually had nothing
to do with gay marriage

23
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,880
and everything to do
with the idiocy of CNN.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,960
Because if you
were watching them yesterday,

25
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,960
you may have seen this.

26
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,480
And this just in to CNN:

27
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,720
An unnerving sight today at
a London gay pride celebration...

28
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,120
an ISIS flag among
a sea of rainbow colors.

29
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,280
I seem to be the only person
who has spotted this.

30
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,200
And nobody seems
to be raising any questions

31
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,800
or pointing it out.

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,440
Yeah, I'll... tell you why
they weren't raising any questions.

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,120
That's not the ISIS flag.

34
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,480
That's a flag with dildos
and butt plugs all over it.

35
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,480
And yet... and yet,

36
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,840
for more than seven
spectacular minutes,

37
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,320
CNN had it onscreen,

38
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,520
even calling one
of their terrorism experts

39
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,120
to try to figure out why ISIS

40
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,680
might be marching with
the gay community through London.

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,880
Which did seem surprising.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,120
Now it turns out...
it's a full day later now...

43
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,080
and they've still not addressed
that mistake on air,

44
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,040
probably because it would be
just too embarrassing

45
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,440
to have a professional journalist say,

46
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,520
"I'm sorry. Despite working at CNN,"

47
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,040
"it seems I don't know what
a dildo looks like. I don't know."

48
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,320
So let's... let's move on.

49
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,320
Let's move on to the Supreme Court,

50
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,360
America's nine
most fascinating legal scholars,

51
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,680
or nine most boring wizards.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Marriage equality wasn't actually
their only major ruling this week.

53
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,520
Today, in a landmark
six-to-three decision,

54
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,920
the Supreme Court voted
to uphold nationwide subsidies

55
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,440
to help poor and middle-class Americans
purchase health insurance

56
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,040
under the Affordable Care Act.

57
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,520
It's amazing. Somehow...
Somehow, against all the odds,

58
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,760
Obamacare is still alive.

59
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,280
It's the... it's the legislative
equivalent of Keith Richards.

60
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,920
It really could have died
in so many ways by now,

61
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,000
but I'm definitely glad
it's still around.

62
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,240
There was genuine concern

63
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,920
that this case could have dismantled
Obamacare completely,

64
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,840
and if it had, it would have been
for the dumbest possible reason.

65
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,160
The challenge was based
on these four words...

66
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,520
quote, "established by the state."

67
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,800
Opponents said the phrase made federal
subsidies illegal in certain states.

68
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,800
Yes, "established by the State"

69
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,320
could have been
the four most damaging words

70
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,200
since "Godzilla just joined ISIS"
or "piranhas now have legs"

71
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,920
or "Mom's on Facebook now."

72
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,200
Luckily... luckily, the Supreme Court
realized that in context

73
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,440
"the State" meant "the government,"
and not "one of the 50 states."

74
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,440
But Chief Justice Roberts did point out
that the law could have been clearer.

75
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,440
Roberts acknowledged the law

76
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,960
"contains more than a few
examples of inartful drafting."

77
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,560
But he said the opponents' approach
would lead to a "calamitous result."

78
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,800
And that's true... "inartful drafting"

79
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,320
put 6.4 million people's health
coverage at risk, which is insane,

80
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,520
because language
is inartfully drafted all the time.

81
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,240
For example, let me show
you an actual banner

82
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,160
supporting England's
Women's World Cup team this year...

83
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,160
"Come On Our Girls !"

84
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,160
That sentence really could have
used a comma.

85
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,200
Just throw a comma in there.

86
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,840
But... but like the Supreme Court,

87
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,000
you fundamentally understand
the intention behind it.

88
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,760
Nobody is arguing that we should
literally do what it says.

89
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,120
Now, this landmark decision

90
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,640
inevitably drew
a dissent from Antonin Scalia,

91
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,800
a pizzeria chef statue
that came to life

92
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,280
but never acquired
human emotions or empathy.

93
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,480
And Scalia was emphatic
in his response to Roberts.

94
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,840
His opinion sparked a blistering
dissent by Justice Antonin Scalia,

95
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,280
who took the unusual step
of summarizing it from the bench,

96
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,720
calling the court's reasoning "absurd,"
"interpretive jiggery-pokery,"

97
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,440
and "pure applesauce."

98
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,040
I'm sorry. "Jiggery-pokery" ?

99
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,560
"Pure applesauce" ?

100
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,200
Are you a justice
or a Victorian dowager

101
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,800
writing an angry letter to "Prim &
Proper Ladies' Monthly" magazine ?

102
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:45,000
Listen, Scalia, let me answer you in
terms that I think you'll understand.

103
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,880
Because, yes, the court's
ruling was a bit frippity-frappity.

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,360
But I say this... if it takes a touch
of goofery and baba ghanoush

105
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,000
to help people... to help keep the
people of this great nation healthy,

106
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,480
well, then, by hiblet or by giblet,
bring on the hoople and zizzle-zazzle,

107
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,480
because that's the kind of country I
want to live in. I said good day, sir !

108
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,360
Blueberries !
Blueberries and custard, sir !

109
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,400
Blueberries and custard.

110
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,160
And lastly...
lastly this week, Ukraine,

111
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,120
currently Russia's
fastest-growing import.

112
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,840
You... may remember ex-Ukrainian
president Viktor Yanukovych

113
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,600
fled the country last year
after a popular uprising.

114
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,800
He was accused of embezzlement
and corruption,

115
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,080
perhaps best symbolized
by his lavish wooden house,

116
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,080
which, I think we can all agree,

117
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,440
is what termites think about
when they masturbate.

118
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,080
It... This thing contained
excesses both small and large,

119
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,480
from a golden loaf of bread

120
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,680
to this private zoo
featuring ostriches.

121
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,000
Well, this week, Yanukovych reemerged
for an interview to explain

122
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,480
the existence
of his private ostrich zoo.

123
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,520
That I supported the ostriches ?
What's wrong with that ?

124
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,680
You supported the ostriches.

125
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,400
Yes, they just lived there.

126
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,520
What... what do you mean,
"they just lived there" ?

127
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,840
Ostriches are not native to Ukraine.
They can't have just been there.

128
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,640
They're ostriches, not Kate Bosworth.

129
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,120
Where... where did she come from ?

130
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,320
Was she in something at some point ?

131
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,880
Was she in anything at any point ?

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,560
I... I think she might
have always been here.

133
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,720
And to... to that reporter's credit,
he did not let that answer slide.

134
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,520
Excuse me,
but it's a little hard to believe

135
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,520
that the president of the country
lives in a place

136
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,880
where there just happened
to be ostriches wandering around.

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,520
No, they weren't just wandering around.
It was a totally separate territory.

138
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,080
No, it was one territory.
I went there myself.

139
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,720
Okay, it was one territory.

140
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,640
But I have 1.7 hectares
attached to my home.

141
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,000
I did not have time to be there.
I was working.

142
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,920
Even though I do love animals.

143
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,240
Okay, no. No !

144
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,400
Because even if you love animals,
no one loves ostriches.

145
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,960
No one even likes them.
Look at this thing.

146
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,880
It looks like a shaved ballerina
wearing a merkin.

147
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,960
It looks like a cat toy
fucked a giraffe.

148
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,000
And look, no offense, ostriches,
but this is not the face of an animal.

149
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,960
It's a very old cactus
that happens to have a vagina.

150
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,760
That's a fact. That's an animal fact.

151
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,760
Now, interestingly,

152
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,280
since Yanukovych abandoned
the property, it's opened to visitors,

153
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,360
which has brought
some problems of its own

154
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,320
for a male ostrich named Igoliak,
as this Ukrainian TV report shows.

155
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,000
The zoo technician says the visitors
annoy the ostrich Igoliak very much,

156
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,240
and even his fertility
has fallen because of them.

157
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,760
He could possibly manage to breed,

158
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,800
but it seems he is too stressed
and can't do it.

159
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,040
Yes, apparently,

160
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,800
because Yanukovych did not socialize
his bird monsters properly,

161
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,360
they're now too nervous
to fuck in public,

162
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,200
which, frankly, is yet another tragedy
for the people of Ukraine.

163
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,320
Because we researched it, and
ostrich sex is absolutely hilarious.

164
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,520
Look at this... first, the male ostrich
sits on the female like she's a futon,

165
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,240
then flaps around arrhythmically,
waving from side to side,

166
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,840
while the poor female, who, frankly,
could not be less into this,

167
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,280
just sits there
and waits until he's done,

168
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,080
at which point the male ostrich
triumphantly flounces off

169
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,920
to go and tell his friends
all about it.

170
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,920
And what better metaphor...
could there possibly be

171
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,880
for Yanukovych and Ukraine ?

172
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,040
He just plopped down, had his way with
the country, and then flounced off,

173
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,480
leaving it wondering
what the fuck just happened.

174
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,720
And now this.

175
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,160
And now,

176
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,600
a few more seconds of hot ostrich sex.

177
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,640
Moving on, moving on.

178
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,480
This... this has clearly been
a big week for the LGBT community.

179
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,440
But it's also been a big year
for the "T" part of that equation,

180
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,520
from Caitlyn Jenner's
"Vanity Fair" cover

181
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,560
to TV shows like "Transparent,"

182
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,480
to another small milestone
just this Friday.

183
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,160
Actress Laverne Cox
marked another milestone

184
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,840
with a drop of a curtain
at Madame Tussauds San Francisco.

185
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,280
Now that is a big step forward

186
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,400
for transgender Americans,
and it's frankly about time.

187
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,480
Because bear in mind,
it came after the same milestone

188
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,840
for spider Americans and Wookies.

189
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,240
But for all the strides transgender
people have made lately,

190
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,240
let's not get too complacent
about how far we've come,

191
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,200
because they still face
a host of obstacles.

192
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,840
Even when the news media
are trying to be supportive,

193
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,000
they can make dumb mistakes.

194
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,400
Your private parts are
different now, aren't they ?

195
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,040
I don't want to talk about it because
it's still... it's really personal.

196
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,240
Don't you feel funny
with the wrong genitalia ?

197
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,640
Not as a joke... you stand up
in the women's bathroom.

198
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,200
- You've got breast implants ?

199
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,040
I, you know, I...

200
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,640
They're tasteful,
whatever's going on there.

201
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,880
So if I saw you undressed,

202
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,160
you would look like a woman
to me, totally. Yes ?

203
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,960
What are you doing ?

204
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,040
It is no more okay to ask transgender
people about their sex organs

205
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,040
than it would be to ask Jimmy Carter
whether or not he's circumcised,

206
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,280
which, by the way, he is.

207
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,360
Smooth like a boiled carrot.

208
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,760
And... and sometimes...
don't think about that...

209
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,160
and sometimes the media's confusion
is even more basic than that,

210
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,440
as in the case of this Arizona
weatherman just two weeks ago.

211
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,520
And a transgender woman
says she was kicked out of a Tempe bar.

212
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,480
Let's bring it back
to that earlier headline.

213
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,520
Now what is a transgender woman ?

214
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,520
- Yes ?
- What does that even mean now ?

215
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,120
- Okay.
- Do we need a break ?

216
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,280
She used to be a guy.

217
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,960
But now is a woman.

218
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,480
- This is... this is... Okay.
- So weird.

219
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,040
Aren't you just saying a woman then ?
I can't even keep up anymore !

220
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,960
Holy shit.

221
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,440
I really hope that's also how
he reports the weather.

222
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,360
"Wait... wait ! It used to be rainy
and now it's sunny ?"

223
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,600
"So... so now it's just sunny ?
I can't even keep up anymore !"

224
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,480
"I can't... This doesn't
make my head work."

225
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,520
Look. Look, though,

226
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,720
let's give him
the benefit of the doubt.

227
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,160
Maybe for him and for many people,
this is new information.

228
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,840
Maybe he's thinking about
transgender issues for the first time

229
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,680
and he needs a minute
to try and understand it.

230
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,560
So let's take that minute
to fill in that bamboozled weatherman

231
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,280
and everyone else
on some basic details.

232
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,520
Transgender people
have a gender identity

233
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,720
that differs from the one
they were assigned at birth,

234
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,360
and that gender identity is not
the same as sexual orientation.

235
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,480
Gender identity is who you are.
Sexual orientation is who you love.

236
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,280
Some transgender people
do undergo hormone therapy

237
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,720
or sex reassignment surgery as
part of their transition, some do not.

238
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,000
And interestingly, their decision
on this matter is, medically speaking,

239
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,120
none of your fucking business.

240
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,640
And if you're still wondering,
"Well, hold on, hold on."

241
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,840
"What... what do I call a transgender
person ? It's so confusing."

242
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,560
Actually it's pretty simple. Call
them whatever they want to be called.

243
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,880
You can do it. We do it all the time.

244
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,400
Think of it this way.
David Evans woke up one day and said,

245
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,680
"Everyone call me The Edge."
And we all went, "Fine, The Edge.

246
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,720
Are we talking the noun or the verb ?"

247
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,600
And that's... it's not just that.
It's not just that.

248
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,120
Over the past 20 years, we've agreed
to call this man Puff Daddy,

249
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,760
P. Diddy, just Diddy,
and now Puff Daddy again,

250
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,960
and most people don't even like him.

251
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,600
And... and here's the thing.
Here's the important thing.

252
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,600
It's genuinely crucial
that we get this right.

253
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,280
Cause there are more transgender people
in the US than you might realize.

254
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,440
One study estimates that nearly 700,000
American adults are transgender.

255
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,840
That's more than
the population of Boston,

256
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,320
and you probably
know someone from Boston.

257
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,000
I'll give you a clue... it was the guy
who wore a Bruins jersey

258
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,840
to your sister's wedding.

259
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,480
And while... while a handful
of transgender people

260
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,120
have been winning awards or appearing
on magazine covers,

261
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,280
the community at large has been facing
some staggering challenges.

262
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,080
A 2011 survey by the National Center
for Transgender Equality

263
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,440
found 41% of transgender people
had attempted suicide.

264
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,800
They're nearly four times more likely

265
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,720
to make less than $10,000 a year
compared to the general population.

266
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,680
78% of those surveyed reported
harassment

267
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,200
during K-through-12 schooling,

268
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,040
35% reported physical assault,
and 12% were sexually assaulted.

269
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,560
That is terrible.

270
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,480
Those statistics are so depressing,

271
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,520
it's enough to make you angry
at the very concept of numbers.

272
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,560
"Fuck you, symbols meant
to represent a specific value !"

273
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,280
"You're the absolute worst !
The worst !"

274
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,920
Look, look,
we've clearly got work to do.

275
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,200
Because when you're transgender,

276
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,520
pretty much any interaction
with bureaucracy

277
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,040
can be humiliatingly difficult.

278
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,520
Just take what happened
to two transgender women

279
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,200
when they went to the DMV
in West Virginia.

280
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,160
Both women were asked
to remove all their jewelry,

281
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,840
makeup and wigs before the
DMV would photograph them.

282
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,680
They're saying that I need
to fulfill certain...

283
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,520
a certain look that they
are designating means "male."

284
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,720
And that I'm, you know, hiding
who I am, which I'm absolutely not.

285
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,160
Both women say they were
also referred to as "it."

286
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,840
Words can't explain
the humiliation I felt that day.

287
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,200
That was the worst thing
in 52 years of my life

288
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,040
I have ever felt.

289
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,280
Listen, I'm not saying anyone
has a good DMV experience,

290
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,680
but that is the worst
I have ever heard.

291
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,400
And for the record,

292
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,240
you get to pick virtually everything
else on your driver's license.

293
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,880
They ask you your weight.
They don't weigh you like a prize hog.

294
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,880
Plus, the whole idea
of a driver's license photo

295
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,560
is to present how you look
from day to day.

296
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,040
That's why DMV employees
tell you not to smile,

297
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,920
because they can't imagine
anyone whose normal existence

298
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,760
involves happiness in any form.

299
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:35,120
And even in... even in organizations
that have seemed willing to change,

300
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,720
that change has come
frustratingly slowly.

301
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,840
Take the military.

302
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,000
Both the secretary of defense
and President Obama have indicated

303
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,680
they are open to transgender troops
being able to serve.

304
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,080
And yet, they're still
banned from enlisting

305
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,840
because of weirdly archaic restrictions

306
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,680
on things like "defects of the
genitalia such as change of sex"

307
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,200
and "psychosexual conditions
including but not limited

308
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,640
to transsexualism and transvestism."

309
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,760
Our current recruitment poster
is essentially,

310
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,240
"I want you, maybe, after we talk about
your genitals for a bit."

311
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,880
"I know that's weird,
but for the moment,"

312
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,560
"this is apparently
how we do things."

313
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,840
And yet, even despite
those restrictions on enlistment,

314
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:21,040
by one estimate, there are currently
15,000 transgender service members.

315
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,360
And while you can be
discharged for being transgender,

316
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,760
those rules are enforced inconsistently

317
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,840
depending on your branch
of service and commanding officer.

318
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,920
Meaning experiences can vary wildly.

319
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,120
For some, like Logan Ireland,
it can be great.

320
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,280
What I like about this deployment
is I can be my authentic self.

321
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,840
I'm just another guy.

322
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,960
Whereas back home,
I'm still seen as female,

323
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,800
and I go by female regs and standards.

324
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,120
Here in Afghanistan, a war zone,

325
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,920
it's like a vacation to me,
because I can be myself

326
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,640
in such an austere environment.

327
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,800
It is not a great sign
for how we treat transgender people

328
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,600
that Afghanistan is
"a place where you can be yourself."

329
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,840
That is the least likely
tourism slogan for Afghanistan.

330
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,760
"Well, I'd put it right behind
Water Park Capital of the World

331
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,240
and Birthplace of the Twerk."

332
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,160
But compare that

333
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,840
with the experience
of Captain Jacob Eleazer

334
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,560
of the Army National Guard,

335
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,680
who faced discharge
for being transgender

336
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,840
despite his own commander's support

337
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,360
and the fact he was being
awarded a medal.

338
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,840
The thing that stuck with me the most

339
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,120
is as they were pinning that Army
commendation medal on me,

340
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,120
my regimental commander said,

341
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,960
"Thank you for everything that you've
done for our regiment, Jacob."

342
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,680
And used... used my real name.

343
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,840
And I... I can't express

344
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,920
just the emotion of that juxtaposition.

345
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,840
It's like you're kicking me out, but...

346
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,720
you're acknowledging me for myself and
giving me an award at the same time.

347
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,560
That's utterly ridiculous.

348
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,840
They gave him an award
and then tried to kick him out.

349
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,400
It's pretty much what Hollywood
did to Cuba Gooding, Jr.,

350
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,520
and that wasn't okay either.

351
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,080
But... but this is the big problem.

352
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,320
Because even when people say the right
things about the transgender community,

353
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,840
too often, practical change
fails to follow.

354
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,400
And perhaps the perfect embodiment
of this concerns bathrooms.

355
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,720
We all use them.

356
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,840
As the good book tells us,
"Everyone Poops."

357
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,840
Or, as it's known in England,
"Everyone Poops But the Queen."

358
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,720
She has people do it for her.

359
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,440
Across the country,
there have been efforts by lawmakers

360
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,840
to fight nondiscrimination ordinances

361
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,960
with so-called bathroom bills,
like this one in Arizona.

362
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,840
It's a new show-me-your-papers
bill for Arizona.

363
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,520
The sex on your birth certificate
would have to match

364
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,560
the sex of the bathroom
or locker room that you use.

365
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,640
The target ? Transgender men
and women here in Arizona.

366
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,880
Six months in jail, $2,500 fine,
for just going in to pee.

367
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,880
$2,500 fine for peeing
in the wrong place.

368
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,840
Look, unless you happen to urinate
a 1989 Chateau Petrus,

369
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,000
you're not even going
to break even on that deal.

370
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,480
In the most recent session,
at least 13 bathroom bills

371
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,480
have been introduced
in state legislatures,

372
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,320
and the reasoning behind them
can be pretty insulting.

373
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,720
Just listen to presidential candidate
Mike Huckabee.

374
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,000
We are now in city after city
watching ordinances that say

375
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,160
that your seven-year-old daughter,
if she goes into the restroom,

376
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,840
cannot be offended,
and you can't be offended,

377
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,880
if she is greeted there
by a 42-year-old man

378
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,960
who feels more like a woman
than he does a man.

379
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,840
I wish someone had told me
when I was in high school

380
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,360
that I could have felt like a woman

381
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,880
when it came time
to take showers in PE.

382
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,840
I'm pretty sure I would have
found my feminine side

383
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,840
and said, "Coach, I think I'd rather
shower with the girls today."

384
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,640
You're laughing because it
sounds so ridiculous, doesn't it ?

385
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,600
There's something inherently wrong

386
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,320
with forcing little children
to be a part of this social experiment.

387
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,680
No. But there is something
inherently wrong

388
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,440
with forcing us to listen
to your fucked-up daydreams

389
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,680
about all the sex crimes you would have
committed as a teenager

390
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,920
had you just been able
to find a legal loophole.

391
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,880
That's weird.

392
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,240
And that... that kind of baseless
fear-mongering is everywhere.

393
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,000
It even turned up in a campaign ad

394
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,280
when Gainesville, Florida, was
trying to pass one of these bills.

395
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,360
On January 28, 2008,
your City Commission made this legal.

396
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,400
Okay, let's... let's break
that bullshit down.

397
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,200
Because first,
assaulting children is still illegal.

398
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,840
Secondly, someone abusing
a nondiscrimination ordinance

399
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,680
to assault someone in
a bathroom is almost unheard of.

400
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,040
It's a borderline imaginary crime,

401
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,520
like dragon rustling
or space bestiality.

402
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,720
Sure, it's terrible,
but it doesn't really happen.

403
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,400
Also, forcing transgender
people into certain bathrooms

404
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,440
can actually be much more disruptive,

405
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,960
as activist Michael Hughes,
a transgender man,

406
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,840
showed with this photo of himself

407
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,960
looking understandably awkward
in a ladies' room.

408
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,920
Because there are many places
that Michael would fit in.

409
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,960
A tattoo parlor in Reno,

410
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,040
playing steel guitar
in a Johnny Cash tribute band,

411
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,800
or on the label
of his own barbeque sauce.

412
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,280
But a women's bathroom ?
Not so much.

413
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,840
Besides, it is so much easier
for everyone

414
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,320
when people are allowed to use the
bathroom matching their gender identity

415
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,320
rather than one that might match
the genitalia they were born with.

416
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,200
That is why the little pictures
on bathroom doors

417
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,640
are stereotypical
representations of men and women,

418
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,160
and not biologically accurate
depictions of penises and vaginas.

419
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,960
Because that would be
troubling for children.

420
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,320
"Mommy ! Mommy ?

421
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,280
"Do I go with the one
with the pouty slug"

422
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,000
"or the angry goat skull ?"

423
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,680
"I'm scared."

424
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,480
And yet, legislators have even tried
to enforce these bills

425
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,200
in high schools,
with damaging consequences.

426
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,160
Take the case of Henry Brousseau,
a transgender high school student

427
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,680
who spoke in opposition to a proposed
bathroom bill in Kentucky.

428
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,520
Even though I've been living
as a male for some time,

429
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,040
I've been... been accepted by
my friends and family as male,

430
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,920
I was being forced to use
the girls' bathroom

431
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,040
at my school until very recently.

432
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,720
Because the school administration
did not support my gender identity

433
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,760
by letting me use the restrooms
concordant with my gender identity,

434
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,680
the kids at my school bullied me.

435
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,480
The kids thought that
because the administration

436
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,480
didn't support my gender
identity, they didn't have to either.

437
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,320
And that is the whole point.

438
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,040
Official rules can end up
legitimizing prejudice.

439
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,800
And besides, teenagers really
don't need extra ideas

440
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,960
for how to make
each other's lives miserable.

441
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,480
That's what they do.

442
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,640
"Sit on your own, Becca."

443
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,480
"Side ponytails are
so five nevers ago."

444
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,080
And look, as Henry finished his speech,

445
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,520
it actually seemed like he'd really
connected with the legislators.

446
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,440
If you don't know
a transgender kid already,

447
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,040
you do know... you do now.
You know me, Henry.

448
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,480
Please let me know how I can be
of any further assistance,

449
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,120
and thank you so much
for your time today.

450
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,520
And please vote no on Senate Bill 76.

451
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,960
I educated myself a lot today
and I appreciate the testimony.

452
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,520
You should be proud of yourself

453
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,200
for being able to stand
in front of this committee

454
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,880
and be so articulate in your comments.

455
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,280
Henry, I love you, man.

456
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,840
I appreciate you.
I appreciate your courage.

457
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:01,800
I can't really imagine that anyone else
in this room has the kind of courage

458
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,160
that it took for you to come
and testify today.

459
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,520
Okay, okay. But "I love you, man"
is a little much.

460
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,440
I love Henry, too, but he's not
the best man at your wedding.

461
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,400
He's a teenage boy trying
to take a shit in the men's room.

462
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,920
And... and it's worth noting,

463
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,520
once they were done
patting Henry on the back

464
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,160
and then patting themselves
for patting Henry,

465
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,760
all three of those lawmakers
voted to advance the bill

466
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,400
to force him into bathrooms
where he's bullied.

467
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,240
Now, thankfully,
that particular bill never became law.

468
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,040
But that dynamic of praising
a transgender person's courage

469
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,040
and then not actually supporting them
speaks to the fact

470
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,600
that we are weirdly comfortable
celebrating transgender people

471
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,760
while simultaneously
dehumanizing them at the DMV,

472
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,680
pinning awards to them
as we drum them out of the military,

473
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,440
and constantly quizzing them
about their genitals.

474
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,960
And look, this is a civil rights issue.

475
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,160
And if you are not willing
to support transgender people

476
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,640
for their sake,
at least do it for your own.

477
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,920
Because we've been through this before.
We know how this thing ends.

478
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,320
If you take the anti-civil rights side

479
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,280
and deny people access
to something they're entitled to,

480
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,000
history is not going to be kind to you.

481
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:21,320
There is no biopic where Liam Neeson
kicks the shit out of a suffragist.

482
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,800
There's... there's...
there's not a stamp

483
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,960
featuring George Wallace
at the schoolhouse door.

484
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,960
And you are not going to get a monument

485
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,840
that says at the base of it,
"He told people where to shit."

486
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,720
And now this.

487
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,240
And now, this is not
CNBC's first rodeo.

488
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,720
You've done this for a while.
Not your first Disney on Ice rodeo.

489
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,880
It's not his first rodeo.

490
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,720
The company that...
for whom this is not their first rodeo.

491
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,160
- This is not your first rodeo.
- Not our first rodeo.

492
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,440
This isn't your first rodeo.

493
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,760
This isn't your first rodeo.

494
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,800
I was reading your resume here.
This is not your first rodeo.

495
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,720
I would use the
"not the first rodeo" thing.

496
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,000
This is not Peltz's first rodeo.

497
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,480
It wasn't his first rodeo.

498
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,520
Not Howard Schultz's first rodeo.

499
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,520
Not my first radio... rodeo.

500
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,400
You ever been to a rodeo ?

501
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,360
I'm gonna say that I have,
because I use the expression

502
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,560
that this isn't my first rodeo.

503
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,000
And now...

504
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,840
And finally tonight,
we look at time.

505
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,800
Time... it's the actual thing
that separates men from the boys.

506
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,840
And this week... this week,

507
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,400
there is going to be
an unusual timekeeping event.

508
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,040
A leap second is coming.
Every few years,

509
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,120
an extra second is added
to account for a mismatch

510
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,440
between clocks
and the Earth's rotation.

511
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,160
That's right. This Tuesday night,
there is going to be a leap second.

512
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,600
Just before midnight,
Coordinated Universal Time,

513
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,920
the clock will go from 11:59:59
to 11:59:60,

514
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,120
which sounds less like an actual time

515
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,040
and more like how a puffer fish
describes his ideal woman.

516
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,280
"She's a perfect 11:59:60."

517
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,840
"Real narrow, round,
and then even rounder."

518
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,040
And look, I know an extra second
does not seem like that big a deal.

519
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,000
But you can get a lot done in a second.

520
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,840
You can spoil the twist endings
of classic movies.

521
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,920
I'll show you. Dude's dead.

522
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,840
Soze is Spacey.

523
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,840
Kitchen remodel still in progress,
but very much on track.

524
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,040
The point... the point is...
the point is...

525
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,840
we want you to enjoy
your extra second on Tuesday.

526
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,600
So we have purchased
SpendYourLeapSecondHere.com

527
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,600
and uploaded some of the greatest
one-second videos

528
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,560
you could possibly imagine.
Let me give you a quick taste.

529
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,600
Here is an upside-down sloth
making a weird sound.

530
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,160
That's a great second.
You just spent that second very well.

531
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,320
I'll give you another.
Here is Mariah Carey's dog

532
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,520
getting into a fight
with Mariah Carey's cat

533
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,120
during the taping of Mariah
Carey's "Cribs" episode.

534
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,560
They...

535
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,960
That's... Come on.

536
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,520
That's arguably a more important
second than the Big Bang was.

537
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,640
So please, on Tuesday,
go to SpendYourLeapSecondHere.com

538
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,920
or, indeed, to JohnOliverSecsTapes.com,

539
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,360
which, yes, we bought
before we said it out loud,

540
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,960
and you can enjoy
such magnificent micro moments

541
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,320
as Bobby Cannavale acting the shit
out of the words, "leap second."

542
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,840
Leap second !

543
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,000
Bravo. Bravo, Bobby.

544
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,560
And look, if you're thinking,
well, hold on,

545
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,520
if we all go to that website at the
same time on Tuesday, won't it crash ?

546
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,840
That seems unlikely. Nothing like that
has every famously happened before.

547
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,480
So go to JohnOliverSecsTapes.com
and waste your extra second with us.

548
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,400
That's our show. We're off next week.

549
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,200
We'll be back after that.
Thank you so much ! Good night !

550
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,240
Leap... second ?

551
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,200
Leap second.

552
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,200
Leap second !

553
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,200
