LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,000
Series II
Episode 31

3
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,440
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight" !

4
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,840
I'm John Oliver. Thank you so much
for joining us.

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,960
Just time
for a quick recap of the week,

6
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,760
and it has been a little bleak,

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,040
from Hungary
closing borders to refugees

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,160
to increased tensions between
Israelis and Palestinians,

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,040
but there was one ray
of pure, joyful light

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,360
from New Zealand this week,
hobbits' Australia.

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,000
Their prime minister, John Key,

12
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,600
appeared on a radio show
and was asked to take part

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,960
in one of their regular segments,
where a guest has to honestly answer

14
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,920
10 yes-or-no questions.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,040
Are you ready to play
"Thank You for Your Honesty" ?

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,640
- Do I get a choice ?
- No.

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,680
- No ? Okay, fine.
- Deep breath and you'll be fine.

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,160
Okay, let me stop you there,
'cause that's already amazing.

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,080
The prime minister just
let himself be overruled

20
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,760
by two morning radio DJs !

21
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,400
Are they like the supreme court
in New Zealand or something ?

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,040
And if you're thinking they might have
gone easy on him,

23
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,400
they did not.

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,040
Was the Virgin Mary
really a virgin ?

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,280
No.

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,480
I promise, John Key, this is an
important one.

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,720
- Do you trim your downstairs ?
- No.

28
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,280
Have you ever done wees
in the shower ?

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,360
Yes.

30
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,920
- Have you ever stolen anything ?
- Yes.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,320
- Have you ever sent a dick pic ?
- No.

32
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,640
Holy shit !

33
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,960
I don't know what
I love the most there:

34
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,120
The fact he felt qualified to weigh in
on the Virgin Mary,

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,480
the fact he confessed
to theft and shower urination,

36
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,680
or his admission that he does not trim
his pubic hair.

37
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,000
This is the single greatest political
interview of all time.

38
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,040
I actually think
the only time he might've lied

39
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,200
is regarding the dick pic question,

40
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,600
because of course he has sent one,
and I'll tell you why.

41
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,760
When you are Prime Minister John Key,
every pic is a dick pic.

42
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,240
That's a fact. That's just a fact.
So, let's move on.

43
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,760
Let's move on now to Mexico,

44
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,600
the only place you can get a truly
authentic volcano quesarito.

45
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,880
Mexico's president,
Enrique Peña Nieto,

46
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,000
has been struggling
in the polls recently.

47
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,560
Poverty remains deep-rooted,

48
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,920
and massacres involving security
forces and corruption scandals

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,920
has made Peña Nieto the most unpopular
president in 20 years.

50
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,200
Wow. Mexico's
most unpopular president.

51
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,280
That's actually impressive,
because until recently,

52
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,120
the most unpopular president in Mexico

53
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,960
was still American president
James K. Polk,

54
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,280
also known in Mexico as "that guy who
took Texas from us."

55
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,640
Mexicans are justifiably upset
at the moment,

56
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,560
which is why a video that
the Nieto government placed

57
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,000
on their YouTube page
on Monday was such a bad idea.

58
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,120
In a vignette set
in working-class Mexico,

59
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,360
a carpenter tells off
a workmate moaning

60
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,840
about the government's
controversial reforms.

61
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,920
He ends his lecture
with what the PR department

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,960
must have thought was a killer line.

63
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,240
"Enough already of your complaining,"
he says in slang.

64
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,200
"Enough of your complaining" ?

65
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,000
You get used to hearing politicians
say, "We've heard your voice,"

66
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,720
but they don't usually
follow that up with,

67
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,160
"And it's annoying,
so shut the fuck up."

68
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,040
Unsurprisingly, the Mexican public
was not impressed.

69
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,840
How are we not going to complain

70
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,560
when there is so much wrong
with the country ?

71
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,840
If they solved the problems,
we wouldn't be complaining.

72
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,480
Twitter has jumped on the theme

73
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,760
with a long list of complaints
they do have

74
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,000
in a country where corruption
and impunity dominate.

75
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,320
Within hours, the video was gone.

76
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,480
Yeah, yeah,
gone from their YouTube page,

77
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,800
but not gone from the Internet.

78
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,360
You'd think people would
know by now

79
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,040
you can't delete
anything from the Internet.

80
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,440
The only way to guarantee no one
will see something online

81
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,360
is to put it on Newsweek.com.

82
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,280
That's the only way to guarantee it.

83
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,720
And while the video may
have been taken down,

84
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,520
the hashtag it inspired,
Yachole, Spanish for "Enough,"

85
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,840
is going strong, with people
tweeting things like,

86
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,000
"Enough with the excessive
political theft,"

87
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,720
"forced disappearances,
and corruption,"

88
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,720
and "Enough with your corrupt and
mediocre cabinet, Peña Nieto,"

89
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,160
and my absolute favorite,
a GIF that says,

90
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,640
"Enough with your..." and then
just an exploding poop emoji.

91
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,320
And that is perfect,

92
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,920
because when a government decides to
tell its citizens to stop complaining,

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,960
they should know that shit is
going to blow up in your face.

94
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,280
And finally, this week, Denmark,
also known as Wrong Norway,

95
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,680
Different Sweden, and That's Actually
Not Finland.

96
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,160
You may remember,
last year the Copenhagen Zoo

97
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,520
caused something
of an international scandal.

98
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,040
A Denmark zoo is
facing serious backlash

99
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,880
after it killed a two-year-old giraffe

100
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,960
and fed its remains
to lions on Sunday.

101
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,680
Okay, now obviously, feeding a giraffe
to lions is shocking,

102
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,760
although I will say I'm not
a huge fan of giraffes.

103
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,680
They look like a camel fucked a
cheetah and took neck Viagra.

104
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,520
And yet,
despite the global outcry,

105
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,440
just a few weeks later,
the zoo was at it again.

106
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,560
That same Danish Zoo
that killed a healthy giraffe

107
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,160
has now killed two adult lions
and two lion cubs.

108
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,160
Yes, they fed the giraffe to lions,

109
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,800
and then killed some
of the lions that ate it.

110
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,800
Who did they then feed the lions to ?

111
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,400
Pretty soon the Copenhagen Zoo is
going to be one really fat meerkat

112
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,880
sitting atop a giant pile of bones.

113
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,000
And after all this, you would think

114
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,600
Denmark would tone down
the dead animal stuff a bit,

115
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,320
but now, a different Danish zoo has
taken things to a whole new level.

116
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,880
A zoo in Denmark has an extreme
demonstration planned for next week.

117
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,240
Odense Zoo has
recently announced its plans

118
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,200
to dissect a lion in front of a crowd,
which will likely include children.

119
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,320
In fact, the event coincides
with the fall school break.

120
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,880
It is true. On Thursday,

121
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,520
a Danish zoo dissected a lion
in front of children.

122
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,720
And in case you're wondering
how much they enjoyed that,

123
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,040
let me show you an actual photo
from the event.

124
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,080
That is how much they enjoyed it,
because of course that's how much !

125
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,200
It's like you told them
there's no Santa,

126
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,000
or that there is, but he's dead
and this is his spleen.

127
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,360
And incredibly, some in Denmark still
insisted this was an excellent idea.

128
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,480
I think it's very important
for kids to know

129
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,920
how the animals look like inside.

130
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,040
Yes. Yes, you must learn what a lion
looks like when cut into bits.

131
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,320
You must learn what
causes depression in bears.

132
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,600
You must learn what mosquitoes think
when their parents die.

133
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,040
That's what they think.

134
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,280
That's what they think.

135
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,040
And by the way,
just in case you're assuming

136
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,200
this particular lion
died a natural death,

137
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,200
you do not know Denmark.

138
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,040
The zoo in central Denmark
says the female lion

139
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,720
was euthanized nine months ago because
they had too many lions.

140
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,240
The lion has been kept
in a freezer ever since.

141
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,280
I'll say this: If you're
going to leave something

142
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,360
in your workplace freezer
for nine months,

143
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,680
you'd better be sure to label it,

144
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,520
and even then it won't be safe,
and I'll tell you why.

145
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,960
Janice in accounting
don't give a fuck.

146
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,080
She don't give a fuck.

147
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,080
Listen, if Danish zoos are not
going to stop this behavior,

148
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,840
they may as well start
using it as a selling point.

149
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,800
On behalf of the people of Denmark,

150
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,120
we'd like to invite you to visit one
of our famous Danish zoos.

151
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,480
Come to Copenhagen
and see amazing animals,

152
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,040
like our four sea lions.

153
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,360
Three sea lions.

154
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,920
Say hello to our camel Laurits
and our elephant Birgitte.

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,920
On Thursday, we strangle her.

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,160
Wave to the cute red panda
before it's fed to otters.

157
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,120
And come see otters before they're fed
to one of our three sharks.

158
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,960
Two sharks.

159
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,920
Children will love getting
to know our animals

160
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,920
and then seeing what's inside them.

161
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,360
And the memories of what they've seen
will never leave them.

162
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,360
Denmark's zoos, we are nature's
grim handmaiden,

163
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,840
shuffling off
the mortal coil of beasts

164
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,640
as we dance in doom's firelight.

165
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,120
Moving on. Moving on.

166
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,840
Our main story
tonight is Canada,

167
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,760
the country you think
about so little...

168
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,680
That's it. End of sentence.

169
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,600
But that's a shame, because Canada is
an important country.

170
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,040
They're our largest trading partner,

171
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,040
and the US-Canadian border
is the longest in the world,

172
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,960
stretching from the coastal town of
Who-Gives-A-Shit, Alaska,

173
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,200
to the small fishing village
of Great... Whatever, Maine.

174
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,040
And this makes it a little sad
that you probably don't know

175
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,440
Canada is having
a major election soon,

176
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,920
and by soon, I mean tomorrow

177
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,320
which is in around 50 minutes.

178
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,120
So, by the time we're done,
you'll have waited

179
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,440
until literally almost the last moment

180
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,000
to learn the first thing
about the Canadian election,

181
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,120
an election, by the way,
of historic proportions.

182
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,520
Today, a 78-day campaign begins.

183
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,960
By any standards, gruelling,

184
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,000
and the longest on record
since the 19th century.

185
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,040
Okay, okay, thinking 78 days
is a long campaign

186
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,440
is absolutely adorable.

187
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,280
It's like a woman who has only ever
seen one penis saying,

188
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,720
"That's the longest one ever."

189
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,920
"There couldn't possibly be
one longer than that."

190
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,400
But I have to say, they've packed a
lot into those 78 days,

191
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,040
particularly in the local races,

192
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,440
where one conservative
candidate, Jerry Bance,

193
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,440
the owner of an appliance
repair business

194
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,480
withdrew for a truly
breath-taking reason.

195
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,040
Well, Mr. Bance had the misfortune

196
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,200
of being caught up in
a "Marketplace" investigation

197
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,280
into the ethics of appliance repair
businesses who do house calls.

198
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,720
Jerry Bance responded
to a service call

199
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,560
at a house that was equipped
with hidden cameras

200
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,440
as part of the
"Marketplace" investigation,

201
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,840
and those cameras caught him urinating
in a homeowner's coffee mug,

202
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,560
dumping the urine into a kitchen sink,
giving it a quick rinse,

203
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,320
and then putting it back
into the sink.

204
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,800
That is absolutely disgusting,

205
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,240
although it is surprising Canada was
so shocked about urine in a mug,

206
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,240
considering that's exactly
what Labatt Blue tastes like.

207
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,520
But amazingly...

208
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,960
That's not even the most surprising
scandal in Canada's local races.

209
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,360
An NDP candidate in Hamilton, Ontario,

210
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,040
is apologizing for making a joke
about a Nazi death camp.

211
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,040
In a 2008 Facebook posting,
Alex Johnstone said a picture

212
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,400
of an electrified fence post
at Auschwitz looked phallic.

213
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,040
According to "The Hamilton Spectator,"

214
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,040
Johnstone says she did not know
what Auschwitz was until now.

215
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,640
Wow ! That is parading two
different kinds of ignorance,

216
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,080
not knowing what Auschwitz is
and if she thinks that's phallic,

217
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,280
not knowing what a penis looks like.

218
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,120
And this kind of makes you wonder

219
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,840
who is running
the schools up in Canada.

220
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,280
Johnstone,
a social worker by training,

221
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,000
is the vice chair of the Hamilton
Wentworth District School Board

222
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,520
and a school trustee.

223
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,040
Yes, she helped run a school board.

224
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,120
That would explain why their history
curriculum includes the textbook,

225
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,160
"Poland, 1939-45: Things That Looked
Like Dicks, Mainly."

226
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,920
And I know what you're thinking:

227
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,800
Who cares about Canada's
least-qualified school board member

228
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,360
and Mug Dick, the handyman ?

229
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,640
These are just local elections.

230
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,600
But the thing is, Canadians don't
elect their prime minister directly.

231
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,040
That's decided by how many MPs
each party gets.

232
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,360
So, these local races are vital to who
becomes Canada's next leader,

233
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,960
and the polls are split
between the three major parties:

234
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
the New Democratic Party, or NDP,

235
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,640
the Liberal Party,
and the Conservatives.

236
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,240
It's a good, old-fashioned
Canadian three-way,

237
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,880
which is also the sex act in
which three people apologize

238
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,160
to each other so hard,
they all climax.

239
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,680
The socialist NDP began the election
ahead in the polls,

240
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,040
but they've since lost momentum,

241
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,240
partly because
their leader, Tom Mulcair,

242
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,760
widely thought to be
an excellent legislator

243
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,040
has not been the most
comfortable campaigner.

244
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,960
Here is Mulcair
trying out some slogans.

245
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,920
Health care, childcare,

246
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,600
Pharmacare, Mulcair.

247
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,080
This is what change looks like.

248
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,200
You are not
what change looks like.

249
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,280
I understand you're talking
about your policies,

250
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,360
but still, change,
visually, does not look

251
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,400
like Paul Giamatti's uncle
reading a rhyming dictionary.

252
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,040
Now, as for the Liberal Party, they
are currently in the lead,

253
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,760
campaigning on a platform of tax
breaks for the middle class

254
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,600
and a plan to run a three-year deficit
to boost the economy

255
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,040
and ease the strain
of austerity measures.

256
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,000
Their leader is Justin Trudeau,

257
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,400
son of former
Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau,

258
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,920
a legendary political
figure in Canada.

259
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,640
Although there is some
concern that Justin Trudeau

260
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,400
may not be quite as smart
as his father,

261
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,720
as a journalist who has
covered him concedes.

262
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,040
His father was considered sort of
intellectually brilliant smart.

263
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,080
Does he have that kind of smarts ?

264
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,760
No. And he will tell you that himself.

265
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,360
But he...

266
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,320
I think other people
have used this word, too,

267
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,320
he has an emotional intelligence that
Pierre Trudeau didn't have.

268
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,120
"Emotional intelligence."

269
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,240
That is the kind of made-up quality
you might find on a report card

270
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,120
from a Montessori school.

271
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,360
Well done, Zayden ! You got a squirrel
on Emotional Intelligence.

272
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,760
But on Actual Intelligence,
you got a frowning walrus

273
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,160
which is an "F."
That's an "F," Zayden.

274
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,320
Let's make that walrus smile.

275
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,600
Now, while growing up
in the public eye

276
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,560
has given Justin Trudeau
name recognition,

277
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,280
it also has had its drawbacks.

278
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,560
For instance, if you do
a Google image search on him,

279
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,040
you can find every poor fashion choice
that he's ever made,

280
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,400
from a '90s boy band member
one week before entering rehab,

281
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,720
to an L.L. Bean sweater model
who just underwent a lobotomy

282
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,680
to Johnny Depp's evil twin.

283
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,040
And it's not just photos.

284
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,040
There's also embarrassing
videos out there,

285
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,800
like this one in which
he explains his party trick

286
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,280
of pretending to fall down
a flight of stairs.

287
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,880
Let me show you
how it normally works.

288
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,600
I put a person here, and I'm passing,
so it's like, "Hey."

289
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,920
"How are you ?"

290
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,080
What ? Look, look, look, look.

291
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,040
No one is saying that that is behavior
worthy of a head of state,

292
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,360
but you cannot deny that
it is somewhat satisfying

293
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,040
to watch a soul-patched man
named Justin

294
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,640
with a French accent
just fall down some stairs.

295
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,800
There's something there
that's good about it.

296
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,040
And Trudeau's opponents have used his
lightweight reputation against him,

297
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,680
by running ads like these.

298
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,840
Is Justin ready ?

299
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,320
Justin thinks budgets
balance themselves,

300
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
But Justin hasn't
thought that through.

301
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,320
Justin doesn't understand
the consequences.

302
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,240
Justin. He's just not ready.

303
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,240
Now, repeatedly calling him Justin is
actually very clever,

304
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,920
because the more you say that name,
the less ready for office he sounds.

305
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,760
The name Justin
doesn't convey leadership

306
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,160
so much as it conveys an unwillingness
to sit still

307
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,960
at the pediatrician's office

308
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,480
or ownership of
a System of a Down tattoo

309
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,040
halfway through a painful
laser-removal process.

310
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,240
Those are the two types of Justin that
exist, and just those two.

311
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,640
But despite these concerns,
polls show that Justin

312
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,520
is currently leading incumbent Prime
Minister Stephen Harper,

313
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,960
a man who, thanks to Canada's
lack of term limits,

314
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,840
has already been in office
for almost 10 years.

315
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,040
And while Trudeau has been painted
as a charismatic pretty boy,

316
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,360
no one has ever said either of those
things about Stephen Harper.

317
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,160
Just watch him
try to appear relatable.

318
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,560
Something you might not know about me
is that I love movies and TV shows.

319
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,440
One of my all-time favorites
is "Breaking Bad."

320
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,160
It's available on online streaming
services if you've never seen it.

321
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,360
"I love movies and TV shows"

322
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,240
isn't a statement
that wins over voters.

323
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,000
It's what an alien
in disguise as a human

324
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,840
tells you while trying
to fit in at a dinner party.

325
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,280
But don't be deceived
by his bland exterior.

326
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,680
Where there is banality,
there is evil.

327
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,360
For instance, Harper's government has
passed numerous laws

328
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,400
weakening Canada's
environmental protections,

329
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,040
they've scaled back
health care for some refugees,

330
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,400
which a federal court called
"cruel and unusual,"

331
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,760
and Harper has taken an extremely
strong position on marijuana.

332
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,240
There's just overwhelming and growing
scientific and medical evidence

333
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,360
about the bad long-term
effects of marijuana.

334
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,480
We've spent a couple of generations

335
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,000
trying to reduce the usage
of tobacco in Canada

336
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,600
with a lot of success.

337
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,720
Tobacco is a product
that does a lot of damage.

338
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,760
Marijuana is infinitely worse.

339
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,480
Are you high ?

340
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,480
Marijuana is not worse than tobacco.

341
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,440
The only context in which
that's true is aesthetics.

342
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,360
Look at Paul Newman. Okay.

343
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,760
Now look at whatever the fuck this is.

344
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,280
Marijuana is infinitely worse

345
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,680
in that context
and that context alone.

346
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,120
But Harper's ugliest tendency is
perhaps his pandering to Islamophobes.

347
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,360
Earlier this year, his government
passed a law called

348
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,160
the Zero Tolerance
for Barbaric Cultural Pactices Act.

349
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,040
tiffening penalties for things like
honor killing and polygamy,

350
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,160
despite the fact both those things
were already illegal in Canada.

351
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,400
A few weeks ago, they suggested a
barbaric cultural practices hotline

352
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,440
despite the fact 911
continues to exist in Canada.

353
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,040
And this is on top of the fact that
they once banned women

354
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,320
from wearing the niqab while taking
the oath of citizenship,

355
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,040
a decision that Harper justified

356
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,520
during a French-language
debate like this.

357
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,640
I would never tell my daughter

358
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,280
that a woman should cover her face

359
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,560
because she's a woman.
I would never say that.

360
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,240
Okay. For a start,
if Stephen Harper's daughter

361
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,040
is covering her face, it's probably
because she understandably

362
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,320
does not want to be seen in public
with Stephen Fucking Harper.

363
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,040
But this isn't a debate
about his parenting,

364
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,680
it's a debate about forbidding one
particular religious practice,

365
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,040
and to hear from one of the women
affected by the ban,

366
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,560
she did not appreciate it.

367
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,440
How do you explain to Canadians
why it's so important

368
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,520
to keep your veil on
while taking the oath ?

369
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,920
Because the Canadi...
I actually chose this country for

370
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,880
the reason is, it provides me
with the freedom

371
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,000
to practice my religion as well.

372
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,040
And Canada's federal courts
actually agreed with her,

373
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,640
'cause she sued
Harper's government and won,

374
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,600
presumably arguing
that if Harper was happy

375
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,880
to let Canadians interact with their
government dressed like this,

376
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,840
she should be allowed to wear
whatever the fuck she wants.

377
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,480
And if all of that...

378
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,000
If all of that were not enough

379
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,080
to make you hate Stephen Harper,

380
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,280
there's also the fact
that he has a band

381
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,360
a terrible, terrible band.

382
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,840
That is Stephen Harper
murdering "Sweet Caroline"

383
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,920
with his actual band that he chose to
call the Van Cats,

384
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,040
an apparent play on"vingt-quatre,"
to represent 24 Sussex,

385
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,800
the name of the prime minster's
residence. So, to recap there,

386
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,000
Harper's band's name
is not just a shitty pun,

387
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,480
it's a shitty French pun on the fact
that he is prime minister of Canada.

388
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,040
That is the least rock and roll
thing imaginable

389
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,760
until you see
this photo of Stephen Harper

390
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,320
with the lead singer of Nickelback.

391
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,880
And look, I know it's hard for
Americans to care about this,

392
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,240
but think of it this way.

393
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,240
Picture your next-door neighbor.

394
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,040
You may not be great friends
with her, but you'd be sad

395
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,040
if she started dating
a complete and utter dickhead.

396
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,280
Well, Canada is America's
next-door neighbor

397
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,280
and Stephen Harper is
her dickhead boyfriend.

398
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,360
You know, the one
she won't split up with

399
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,320
despite the fact
he tells her what to wear

400
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,760
and makes her listen
to his shitty, shitty band.

401
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,000
And I would love to tell
the people of Canada right now

402
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,920
to vote Stephen Harper out of office.

403
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Unfortunately, and this is amazing,

404
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,040
it's against Canadian law,

405
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,960
specifically, Section 331
of the Canada Elections Act

406
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,280
which states, "No person who does
not reside in Canada"

407
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,040
"shall induce electors to vote
or refrain from voting"

408
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,280
"for a particular candidate."

409
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,760
And apparently, anyone found guilty
of doing that

410
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,960
could be fined up to $5,000,

411
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,920
given a six-month jail term, or both.

412
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,520
That is a ridiculous law,

413
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,040
and I guess what
you're saying, Canada, is...

414
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,640
"You want to dance ?"

415
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,000
Is that what you're saying ?

416
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,440
'Cause if you want to dance, Canada,

417
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,400
bring your best moves,
'cause it's nearly midnight

418
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,040
and Johnny's got his dancing shoes on.

419
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,000
You think I'm scared of six months
in Canadian prison ?

420
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,880
What's that ? Six months
of living in Ottawa ?

421
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,000
Yes ! That's right !

422
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,400
Keep yourself warm
with that Ottawa burn.

423
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,120
And as for your $5,000 fine,

424
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,120
I simply can't imagine
a better way to spend

425
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,240
5,000 Canadian dollars.

426
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,400
But if telling you not to vote for
Stephen Harper is will cost me $5,000,

427
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,160
I'm going to get my money's worth,

428
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,040
and I'm gonna do it in the most
Canadian way possible.

429
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,040
So please come with me.

430
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,920
Because I'm going to tell you

431
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,680
not to vote for Stephen Harper
alongside this beaver

432
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,400
playing "Sweet Caroline"
on the keyboard

433
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,400
and this moose receiving a colonoscopy

434
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,040
under Canada's fantastic single-payer
health care system,

435
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,720
and finally with the help of one
of Canada's finest sons,

436
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,040
Mike Meyers dressed as a Mountie
riding a snowplough !

437
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,480
Yes ! It doesn't get more Canadian !

438
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,240
It just doesn't get
more Canadian than this !

439
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,800
I think I have
your full attention, Canada !

440
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,120
Oh yes !

441
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,480
Oh yes.

442
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,600
Yes. Yes.

443
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,280
Hi, Mike. Hi. Hi, John, how are you ?

444
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,080
Thank you so much
for doing this.

445
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,280
Is there anything you'd
like to say at this point ?

446
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,040
- Yes, there's lots I'd like to say.
- Okay.

447
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,560
I love Canada,
but the fact that it has a law

448
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,680
banning outsiders from telling
Canadians how to vote

449
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,120
is one of the least
Canadian things possible.

450
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Sure.

451
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,840
Oh, and don't vote
for Stephen Harper.

452
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,960
Exactly. Exactly.

453
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,200
Don't do it, and I'll tell you why.

454
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,320
Stephen Harper doesn't care
about black people !

455
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,160
Oh God ! Not again !

456
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,080
Sorry. Sorry.
What I meant to say was,

457
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,080
Stephen Harper doesn't
care about Muslim people !

458
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,560
Totally fair. Yeah. Yeah.
There you go. There you go.

459
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,040
- I think he made that pretty clear.
- I think it was painful.

460
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,600
So please do not vote
for Stephen Harper !

461
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,240
- Yeah, don't do it !
- Shall we ?

462
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,120
- Shall we, Mike ? Let's.
- Yeah, look at this.

463
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,160
- Here's your $5,000 Canada !
- 5,000 dineros, yeah.

464
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,160
Here's your 5,000 !

465
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,240
Take it ! Take it all !

466
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,640
And now... this.

467
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,920
A student passes put
listening to Stephen harper speak.

468
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,560
In terms of your question,

469
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,920
I travel all around
the country, all over,

470
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,960
meeting people
and making announcements.

471
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:10,080
Don't worry, he was fine.
As was this student, 3 years earlier.

472
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,040
Obviously don't agree on everything,
but he understands that

473
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,160
I think everybody understands
that Canada's a sovereign country.

474
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,520
And now

475
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,320
And finally tonight,
quotations, the karaoke of ideas.

476
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,920
Quotations make us sound smart.

477
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,400
That's why politicians love
throwing them around.

478
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,560
In fact, just recently, Ben Carson
decided to quote a founding father.

479
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:41,120
Thomas Jefferson himself said,
you know, gun control works great

480
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,840
for the people who are
law-abiding citizens,

481
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,800
and it does nothing
for the criminals,

482
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,280
and all it does is put
the people at risk.

483
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,720
I'm pretty sure
Jefferson did not say that,

484
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,040
in part because the term "gun control"

485
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,000
wasn't even used in its modern sense
until the 1960s.

486
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,440
Now, to be fair, the gist of the quote

487
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,640
does appear
in Jefferson's handwriting,

488
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,960
but it was apparently
a paraphrased quote

489
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,320
from Italian philosopher
Cesare Beccaria

490
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,040
that Jefferson had copied
into his journal.

491
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,960
And you cannot give people credit

492
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,440
for saying things
they copied into notebooks.

493
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,840
Otherwise, my teenage self
would've been able

494
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,880
to claim credit
for the Pythagorean theorem

495
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,240
and most Smashing Pumpkins lyrics.

496
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,040
But Carson is just one offender.
In this election cycle alone,

497
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,720
BuzzFeed found that Mike Huckabee,
Scott Walker, and Rand Paul

498
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,040
had all misquoted
great American figures,

499
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,880
which may seem
like unpresidential behavior

500
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,000
were it not for the fact that a
surprising number of presidents

501
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,760
have done the exact same thing.

502
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,040
I came upon this quote
by Abraham Lincoln.

503
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,760
"I am not bound to win"

504
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,240
"but I'm bound to be true."

505
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,800
The principles so eloquently stated
by Abraham Lincoln,

506
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,720
quote, "You cannot strengthen the weak
by weakening the strong."

507
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,720
Mr. Lincoln once said
that you can fool

508
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,960
all of the people some of the time,

509
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,480
and you can fool some
of the people all of the time,

510
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,000
but you cannot fool all of the people
all the time.

511
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,080
Lincoln never said
any of those things !

512
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,760
None of them !

513
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,120
Nor did he say, as this tank top sold
on Etsy would have you believe,

514
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,360
"Four score and seven beers ago."

515
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,040
Not that either !

516
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,960
The Internet is only making

517
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,480
this epidemic of misattributing
quotes worse.

518
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,120
Representative Jody Hice
spent his 2014 campaign

519
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,040
covering his Facebook page
and Twitter feed

520
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,040
with completely inaccurate quotes
from the Founding Fathers,

521
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,680
like this one, which reads,
"Most bad government"

522
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,800
"has grown out
of too much government,"

523
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,040
which there is no record
of Jefferson ever saying.

524
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,200
In fact, it sounds much more like
something Ayn Rand would've said

525
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,360
but, you know, using around
80,000 more words.

526
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,720
But that is the problem with memes.

527
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,320
If you have the right font,
and the right photo,

528
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,720
any quote can seem real, and I'll tell
you how I know that.

529
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,960
Because for years now,

530
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,800
you may have seen
multiple photos of me

531
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,520
comparing gun control
to airport security.

532
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,880
It's an interesting thought.
Here's the thing.

533
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,040
I never said that !

534
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,640
Even though I've now seen it
so many times

535
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,920
I'm starting to genuinely
wonder if I did !

536
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,480
Because with just a few minutes
of photoshopping,

537
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,240
You can make it seem plausible
that anyone said anything.

538
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,520
For instance, did you know
Alexander Hamilton

539
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,600
once said, "I'm not here to make
friends. I'm here to win" ?

540
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,040
Or that Marie Curie said,

541
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,480
"After the show,
it's the after-party."

542
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,840
"After the party,
it's the hotel lobby."

543
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,080
I mean, they didn't say
either of those things,

544
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,840
but admit it there is
some small part of you

545
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,080
that now thinks they might've done.

546
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,680
It seems we have got a decision
to make at this point.

547
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,120
Either we care about
the accuracy of quotes

548
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,040
and make sure that
they're correctly sourced,

549
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,800
or we don't care at all, which is why
we have created a website called

550
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,120
defintelyrealquotes.com

551
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,600
which will generate random misquotes

552
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,640
from historical figures,
such as Thomas Jefferson saying...

553
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,160
"Yeah, I pronounce it pzsketti. Why?
Is there another way?"

554
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,040
Because if quotes no longer
have to be real,

555
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,400
they should at least be fun.

556
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,000
So, please, go online to
definitelyrealquotes.com

557
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,040
hit the "Deliver me
some wisdom" button

558
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,440
and share the misattributed quotes
with the rest of the world.

559
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,040
And, in the words of Adolf Hitler...

560
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,880
So thank you so much for watching !

561
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,040
A huge thanks to Mike Myers !

562
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,120
Good night !

563
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,240
Good night !

564
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,600
