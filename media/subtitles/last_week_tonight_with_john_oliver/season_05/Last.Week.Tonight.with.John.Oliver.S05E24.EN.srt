00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,840
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,520
SEASON V
EPISODE 24

3
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,160
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,520
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,160
I know we usually start
with a recap of the week,

6
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,720
but tonight, this show is going to be
one long recap, of one very long week.

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,960
And one event in particular.

8
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,600
Meaning that, sadly, there is gonna be
no time to talk about Trump

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,160
insisting that the UN was laughing
"with" him and not "at" him,

10
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,880
which it absolutely wasn't.

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,240
Nor is there gonna be time to delve
into what was the most fun story.

12
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,560
The Philadelphia Flyers have
a new mascot and fans are saying:

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,320
"What the ?"
That's 7 foot tall Gritty.

14
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,240
Gritty unveiled in front of kids,
probably scarred for life.

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,520
Yeah, those kids should be scarred.
Gritty is fucking horrific.

16
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,880
Every photo of him is appalling.
Look at this. That is a nightmare.

17
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,920
How about this one ?
That is simply psychotic.

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,040
Gritty looks like the end result

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,320
of the orange McDonald's Fry Guy
hooking up with Grimace.

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,440
We've been over this:
if you're a McDonald's mascot,

21
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,640
you do not have sex
with another McDonald's mascot.

22
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,880
Your genetics are too similar and
their kids always turn out weird.

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,000
It's not like Gritty has any business
being a hockey mascot.

24
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,520
He hasn't figured out how
to navigate on the ice yet.

25
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,440
He fell multiple times
in his debut last night.

26
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,440
The Pittsburgh Penguins tweeting:
"Lol ok."

27
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,520
To which Gritty responded:
"sleep with one eye open, bird."

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,760
Holy shit, Gritty.
Calm down.

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,520
They're engaging
in interteam banter

30
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,960
and you've gone straight to
"I will murder you in your sleep."

31
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,560
There is nothing that I would love
to do more than talk about Gritty,

32
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,280
from the fact that he's already done
a Kim Kardashian-style photo shoot,

33
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,800
to the fact that someone has got
a tattoo of him on their body.

34
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,920
Interestingly, that someone ?
Jimmy Carter.

35
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,120
The fun we had must now stop,
instead we need to talk

36
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,440
about Brett Kavanaugh, Supreme Court
nominee and walking crushed beer can.

37
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,440
Christine Blasey Ford, who accused
Kavanaugh of assaulting her in 1982,

38
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,560
came before the Senate Judiciary
Committee, with a powerful testimony.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,040
I am here today not because
I want to be. I am terrified.

40
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,520
I believe it is my civic duty
to tell you what happened to me

41
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,320
while Brett Kavanaugh
and I were in high school.

42
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,960
And she did just that,
describing in detail her recollection

43
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,800
of how a drunk Kavanaugh
pinned her down,

44
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,440
and put his hand over her mouth
when she tried to scream.

45
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,320
She insisted that this could not be
a case of mistaken identity,

46
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,400
she was certain that it was him
and after her opening statement,

47
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,800
she then took questions,
which sometimes took an odd turn.

48
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,520
The prosecutor to whom the Republicans
had outsourced their responsibilities,

49
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,240
seized on a polygraph test
that Ford had passed.

50
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,720
Did you pay
for the polygraph yourself ?

51
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,560
I don't think so.

52
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,240
Ok. Do you know who
did pay for the polygraph ?

53
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,440
Not yet, no.

54
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,400
I believe you said it hasn't been
paid for yet. Is that correct ?

55
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,760
Let me put an end to this mistery.
Her lawyers paid for her polygraph.

56
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,880
As is routine.

57
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,360
Wait !
Slow your roll there.

58
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,800
"As is routine." Don't you try
and brush her question aside !

59
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,520
She cracked this case open ! She found
the missing piece to the puzzle !

60
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,760
A puzzle that reads
"who fucking cares ?"

61
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,640
Ford's testimony
was brave and compelling

62
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,600
and affected many on the committee,
including Senator Orrin Hatch,

63
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,920
who chose to express his
admiration in a far from ideal way.

64
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,400
Have you found
Dr. Ford credible ?

65
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,240
It's too early to say.
I don't think she's uncredible.

66
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,960
I think she's an attractive,
good witness. But it's way early...

67
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,120
What do you mean by "attractive" ?

68
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,320
In other words,
she's pleasing.

69
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,880
No ! "Pleasing ?" You should
not use the word "pleasing"

70
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,320
to describe a sexual assault survivor
recounting a worst moment of her life.

71
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,200
You shouldn't use it
to describe anything.

72
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,640
Maybe watching milk
mix into your coffee ?

73
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,400
Not even then. The moment you say:
"watching this milk is pleasing,"

74
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,760
you're waiting for everyone to leave
so you can fuck your coffee.

75
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,880
By lunchtime on Thursday,

76
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,400
it seemed that Kavanaugh's
nomination could be finished.

77
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,560
Even Fox News
was implying as much.

78
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:34,320
This was extremely emotional,
raw and credible.

79
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,720
Nobody could listen to her
deliver those words

80
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,560
and talk about the assault
and the impact it had on her life

81
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,920
and your heart go out to her.

82
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,480
This is a disaster
for the Republicans.

83
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,800
Fox News, calling Ford's testimony
a disaster for the Republicans

84
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,680
and not like one
of those Puerto Rico disasters,

85
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,360
this time, one they
might actually care about.

86
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:07,080
Then came Kavanaugh's testimony.
It is worth looking at it in detail.

87
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,920
In every regard, it could not
have been more different from Ford's.

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,800
While she was remarkably composed
in discussing traumatic details,

89
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,840
Kavanaugh came straight out of the
gate weird in his opening statement,

90
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,240
not just denying her allegations,
but almost breaking down

91
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,040
while attempting to paint a folksy
image of his time in high school.

92
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,960
I worked out
with other guys at Tobin's house...

93
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,120
He was the great quarterback
on our football team

94
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,000
and his dad ran workouts.

95
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,160
He's crying at the memory of lifting
weights at his friend Tobin's house.

96
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,680
Men might be too emotional
for the Supreme Court.

97
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:03,080
Also, he'd be really pretty
if he just smiled more.

98
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,880
Wasn't just memories of a high school
quarterback making him tear up.

99
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,480
I have always had a lot
of close female friends.

100
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,720
I remember talking almost every
night it seemed,

101
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,680
to my friends Amy,
or Julie

102
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,800
or Kristin, or Karen, or Suzanne,
or Moira, or Megan, or Nikki.

103
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,480
The list goes on.

104
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,880
That's not testimony
though is it ?

105
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,280
That is a plaintive, spoken
word cover of "Mambo #5."

106
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,320
I remember my friends Angela,
Pamela, Sandra, and Rita.

107
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,600
And as I continue, you know
they're getting sweeter.

108
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,640
But when Kavanaugh
was not choking back tears,

109
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,960
he was starting
to get noticeably angry,

110
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,960
arguing that he was the victim
of a giant conspiracy.

111
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,840
This allegation was unleashed
and publicly deployed

112
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,440
over Dr. Ford's wishes.

113
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,800
And then, as no doubt was expected,
if not planned,

114
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,480
came a long series of false
last-minute smears

115
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,960
designed to scare me and
drive me out of the process

116
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,120
before any hearing occurred.

117
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,200
Crazy stuff.

118
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,960
Gangs, illegitimate children,
fights on boats in Rhode Island.

119
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,080
Come on ! Do I seem
like exactly the type of person

120
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,000
who would get into a fight
on a boat in Rhode Island ?

121
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,320
Seriously ! When you picture
a fight on a boat in Rhode Island,

122
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,400
do you picture two of me yelling at
each other at this pitch and volume ?

123
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,920
That if you wanted my haircut,
you would tell your barber

124
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,960
to give you the "fight on a boat
in Rhode Island" ?

125
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,080
I would like to see you say that
to my face on a boat in Rhode Island

126
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,480
and that's all I have
to shout about that !

127
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,520
Fuck you !
I'll see you on the water !

128
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:24,920
What you've seen was him reading
from a prepared statement.

129
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,680
It got even stranger
once he started taking questions.

130
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,000
Did you consume alcohol
during your high school years ?

131
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,400
Yes, we drank beer. My friends
and I. The boys and girls.

132
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,800
Yes, we drank beer. I liked beer.
Still like beer.

133
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,560
The drinking age, as I noted, was 18
so the seniors were legal.

134
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,200
Senior year in high school,
people were legal to drink.

135
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:56,000
We drank beer and I said sometimes,
probably had too many beers

136
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,760
and sometimes other people
had too many beers.

137
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,440
We drank beer.
We liked beer.

138
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,080
Yeah, I get that. I do.
I get that loud and clear, Brett.

139
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,520
But the question isn't really
"do you like beer ?" Is it ?

140
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,800
It's "how much do you like it ?"
Just like how the question

141
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,920
in Jeffrey Dahmer's trial wasn't
"do you like people ?"

142
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,280
It was: "do you like people
to a really problematic extent ?"

143
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,600
When pressed, Kavanaugh became
either dismissive or outright hostile

144
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,000
and you got a real sense
of who this man actually is.

145
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,080
What do you consider
to be too many beers ?

146
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,200
I don't know.
Whatever the chart says.

147
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:44,520
I like beer. Do you like beer,
senator ? What do you like to drink ?

148
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,280
There's never been a case
where you drank so much

149
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,720
that you didn't remember
what happened the night before ?

150
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,520
It's you're asking about, yeah,
blackout. I don't know. Have you ?

151
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:03,360
Could you answer ? That's
not happened ? Is that your answer ?

152
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,640
Yeah and I'm curious if you have.

153
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,200
Aside from being disrespectful.

154
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,360
"Have you ?" is just not the answer
of an innocent person.

155
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,400
If you ask someone if they blew a dog
and they go: "I dunno, have you ?"

156
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:25,280
He blew a fucking dog. And in all
likelihood, not just one either.

157
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,920
That surly tone was emblematic
of Kavanaugh's demeanor.

158
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,600
Not the tone of one who hopes
to serve on the Supreme Court.

159
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,560
But the tone of someone
who feels entitled to be on it

160
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,640
and can't believe you're being
such a dick about this.

161
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,680
That does make some sense.
He has had every imaginable advantage.

162
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,360
His elite high school has
its own nine hole golf course.

163
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,480
Am I saying that someone who went
to a school with its own golf course

164
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,560
should not be
on the Supreme Court ?

165
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:03,160
Yeah, I think I am. I didn't
plan to when I started that sentence,

166
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,680
but here we are
and I'm gonna stand by it.

167
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,120
Kavanaugh didn't just rely on
belligerence to refute Ford's charges.

168
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,760
He brought evidence.
Specifically, a calendar from 1982,

169
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,440
about which he was, and this
will shock you, weirdly emotional.

170
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,680
Why did I keep calendars ?

171
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,760
My dad started to keeping
detailed calendars of his life in 1978.

172
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,440
He did so as both
a calendar and a diary.

173
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,520
Christmas time, we'd sit around
and he'd regale us with old stories,

174
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,640
old milestones, old weddings,
old events from his calendars.

175
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,120
I know that it may seem cruel

176
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,560
to make fun of a man crying
over his late father's calendars.

177
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,520
What if I were to tell you his father
is alive, and was sitting behind him ?

178
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,720
That's him there. That is why
I am now comfortable saying

179
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,440
that "every Christmas, we'd gather
round and dad would regale us"

180
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,480
"with old events from his calendar"
is the single weirdest fucking thing

181
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,200
I've ever heard anybody say.

182
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:23,120
Kavanaugh said that his dad
started keeping calendars in 1978,

183
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,960
when Kavanaugh was thirteen.

184
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,920
Meaning he would have been 14
at the time his dad had even a calendar

185
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,760
to read to his children from.

186
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,880
An adult man reading last year's
calendar to his fourteen-year-old son

187
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,160
is the saddest Christmas
I can imagine,

188
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,760
other than being one of the innocent
people who gets murdered in "Die Hard".

189
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,920
That is the only other example.

190
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,280
Kavanaugh's calendar may not
have helped him.

191
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:57,560
He told he "never attended a gathering
like the one Dr. Ford describes".

192
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,080
His calendar shows at least
one similar event

193
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,160
with at least two of the people
Ford named in her letter.

194
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,360
Kavanaugh misrepresenting the truth
became a really troubling pattern.

195
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,320
He repeatedly made this strong
claim to poke holes in Ford's story.

196
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,920
I reemphasize: all four witnesses
who were allegedly at the event

197
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,280
have said it didn't happen, including
Dr. Ford's longtime friend, Ms. Keyser.

198
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,560
Except this 53-year-old frat
pledge is misstating the facts.

199
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,320
Three of those merely said they
didn't recall the party as described

200
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,520
and Ford's friend, Ms. Keyser,
did specifically say:

201
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,800
"she believes Ford's allegation."

202
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,480
The fourth person there is
Kavanaugh himself.

203
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,160
Kavanaugh
mischaracterized evidence.

204
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,120
And that is one thing a judge
should know not to do.

205
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,800
It's basically that an don't tuck
your robes into your blue jeans

206
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,000
because it's objectively a bad look.

207
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,920
For all of Kavanaugh's talk of
his wholesome teenage years,

208
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,640
spent respecting women
for their friendships

209
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,120
and doing sick reps
in Tobin's dad's house,

210
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,040
his high school yearbook
tells a different story.

211
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,080
He and his bros friends brag
about being "Renate Alumni",

212
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,000
referring to a girl they knew.

213
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,440
Kavanaugh claims that was asexual and
"clumsily intended to show affection"

214
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,560
"and that she was one of us."

215
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,800
Which is hard to believe,
given that A:

216
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,840
Renate only just
found out about it

217
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,760
and said "'the insinuation is horrible,
hurtful and simply untrue."

218
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,040
And B: if it was just affection for
a friend, where's the alumni society

219
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,080
for Amy, or Julie,
or Kristin, or Karen, or Moira ?

220
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,440
Especially Moira.
Moira most of all.

221
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,840
Kavanaugh had similarly implausible
explanations for other terms,

222
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,560
specifically those commonly associated
with drinking or sex.

223
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,080
Have you... I don't know
if it's "boufed" or "boofed",

224
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,680
how do you pronounce that ?

225
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,960
That refers to flatulence.
We were 16.

226
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,800
Let's look at "Beach Week Ralph Club
Biggest Contributor",

227
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,120
what does the word "ralph"
mean in that ?

228
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,960
That probably
refers to throwing up.

229
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,320
I'm known to have
a weak stomach.

230
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,760
- Devil's triangle ?
- Drinking game.

231
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,160
Bullshit.

232
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,400
The term "devil's triangle"
is commonly known to refer

233
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,040
to a threesome involving
two men and one woman.

234
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,440
I am not buying that,
unless all your drinking games

235
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,200
were named
after widely recognized sex acts.

236
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,840
Doggy style ? Drinking game.
You pour vodka in a bowl

237
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,600
and you lap it up while
wearing only a dog collar.

238
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,680
Fisting ?
Drinking game.

239
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,800
Gripping a shiraz in each fist and
toasting the progress of feminism.

240
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,960
69ing ?
Absolutely drinking game.

241
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,240
That's listening to Bryan Adams
hit song "Summer of '69"

242
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,800
while drinking
a beer on the porch.

243
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:58,080
Even C-SPAN callers were not buying
this drinking game defense.

244
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,720
Go ahead, Carl.

245
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,320
I just wanted to echo a few things
that another caller said,

246
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,040
which is that a devil's triangle
is certainly not a drinking game.

247
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,480
It's an encounter
with two men and a woman.

248
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,800
We'll go next to Mary
in Bronxville.

249
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,320
I'd like to imagine
that that guy calls in every day

250
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,520
to describe what
a devil's triangle is

251
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,800
and that was the only chance of getting
all the way through his explanation.

252
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,680
It seems petty to give this attention
to a high schooler's yearbook,

253
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,960
remember that to some extent,
many were watching this hearing

254
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,760
to try and ascertain
who was more trustworthy.

255
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,800
Was it the terrified psychology
professor who blew up her entire life

256
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,160
to relive her trauma
on a national stage ?

257
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,920
Or was it Judge Animal House,

258
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,880
making up drinking games
before members of the Senate ?

259
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,200
And yet, for some senators,
Kavanaugh's poor performance

260
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,600
was immaterial, as they
had already made up their mind.

261
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,760
Orrin Hatch, taking a break
from being "pleased",

262
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,680
made the broad case that
it was ridiculous to even ask questions

263
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,880
about an event that took place
such a long time ago.

264
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,320
This is a national disgrace,
the way you're being treated.

265
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,040
There's been no misconduct
by him in the time he's been a judge.

266
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,760
What we have are uncorroborated,

267
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,480
unsubstantiated claims
from his teenage years !

268
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,320
Now, that is clearly a shitty,
disingenuous argument,

269
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,680
I will give Hatch credit for
invoking "teenage years"

270
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,880
with the voice of a 13 year-old
whose balls are dropping.

271
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,840
Lindsey Graham turned his
performative disgust up to ten.

272
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,800
This is the most unethical sham
since I've been in politics.

273
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,880
If you really wanted
to know the truth,

274
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,960
you wouldn't have done
what you've done to this guy.

275
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,080
You're looking
for a fair process ?

276
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,040
You came to the wrong town
at the wrong time, my friend.

277
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,320
First of all: Lindsey Graham sounds

278
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,920
like the least intimidating sheriff
in the entire Wild West.

279
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,640
You turn back around and get back
on your horse, Mr. Man,

280
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,640
'cause you're looking at the soft,
tender little babyface of justice.

281
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,400
You came to the wrong town
at the wrong time, my friend.

282
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,240
Babyface ! Justice !
Get on your horse ! Ride !

283
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,000
Second: Lindsey Graham
is not actually wrong.

284
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,800
He looks like a doll not allowed
to be within 50 feet of a playground,

285
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,440
but he is not technically wrong,
this process was deeply flawed,

286
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,960
because he and the Republican
majority designed it that way.

287
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,240
If they wanted to avoid
a "he said, she said" situation,

288
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,720
they could have, but instead,
they only called two people,

289
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,680
so we only heard what he said
and what she said.

290
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,080
A fairer process would have
involved gathering evidence

291
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,240
and hearing from others,
like Kavanaugh's classmates,

292
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,400
his high school friend Mark Judge,
who Ford says was in the room.

293
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,760
That is not how Republicans
chose to set up the hearing.

294
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,600
For Kavanaugh's emotional
appeals about wanting his name cleared,

295
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,240
he was asked about whether
he supported an FBI investigation

296
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,240
and he dodged the question.

297
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,240
Judge Kavanaugh, will you
support an FBI investigation ?

298
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,040
I will do whatever
the committee wants to...

299
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,560
Personally, do you think that's
the best thing for us to do ?

300
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,360
- You won't answer ?
- Look, Senator...

301
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:46,520
I have said I wanted a hearing and
I said I was welcome anything.

302
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,200
You'll "welcome anything ?"
Say you will support an investigation !

303
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,240
You've been accused of a crime
that you insist you did not commit.

304
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,960
I would be desperately trying to prove
my innocence in every possible way:

305
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,280
investigations, polygraph tests, sworn
affidavits from not only Mark Judge

306
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,920
but also all my other boys
from G-Town Prep:

307
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,360
I'm talking about Tobin,
Timmy, Squee, PJ, Cumrug, Tooks,

308
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,480
Merc, C-Dubs, Dirty Pete, Fat Andy,
Spliffdog The Horndog, Bonerwitz,

309
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,360
Bonerwitz's brother, J-Money,
and Shit Dick.

310
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:27,560
Character witnesses.
At this point, let's pull back and look

311
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,840
at the picture of Kavanaugh's
character that we now have.

312
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,880
Even if you don't think
he's guilty of sexual assault

313
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,040
or even if you think it's impossible
to say whether he is

314
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,760
because it happened in
his "teenage years"...

315
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,280
Even then there should be plenty
to cause you real concern.

316
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,320
A key part of the job that he is up for
is judgment and temperament.

317
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,600
We saw Kavanaugh talk over the top
of senators, dodge questions

318
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,560
and conflate "doesn't recall
something happening"

319
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,600
with "denies something happened"

320
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,720
which is an important
distinction for a judge.

321
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,480
Not to mention, he repeatedly
wept at the concept of calendars.

322
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,640
There was one more important
moment disqualifying in and of itself.

323
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,600
A Supreme Court Justice should make
decisions independent of politics.

324
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,560
Kavanaugh himself has stated:

325
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,800
"the court must never be viewed
as a partisan institution."

326
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,800
And yet, in his opening statement,

327
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,640
a document he had time
to draft and consider,

328
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,880
his tone was
positively Trumpian.

329
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,960
This two-week effort has been
an orchestrated political hit

330
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:45,000
fueled with apparent pent-up anger
about Trump and the 2016 election,

331
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,640
fear that has been unfairly stoked
about my judicial record,

332
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,600
revenge on behalf of the Clintons
and millions of dollars in money

333
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,400
from outside
left-wing opposition groups.

334
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,360
That is absolutely horrifying.
And it is worth taking a moment to note

335
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,760
the norm
that has just been shattered.

336
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,320
We're all basically callused
to people talking that way now,

337
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,840
but we are supposed to have
at least nine people left in America

338
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,360
who do not talk that way.

339
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,600
Kavanaugh just all but came out
and said he's gonna approach his tenure

340
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,360
as one giant case of
"Me v. The Fucking Libtard Cucks".

341
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,320
This brings me to the most basic
question that remains: why ?

342
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,120
Why this particular asshole ?

343
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,600
Why is he the hill that conservatives
are willing to die on ?

344
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,120
I know that for some of Kavanaugh's
most ardent supporters,

345
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,600
this is a purely ideological issue.

346
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,520
Senators may not say it out loud,
but this "woman for Kavanaugh" did.

347
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,160
I'm hoping he gets in personally
because I want abortion to stop.

348
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,760
Even if it turns out he's guilty,
I'm still gonna support him

349
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,320
this could be
a chance to overturn abortion.

350
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,240
It's fine, to appoint someone
who has committed sexual assault

351
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,600
to the Supreme Court, as long
as they will curtail abortion rights.

352
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,160
It's a stance that prioritizes
human lives,

353
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,840
as long as you think life begins
at conception,

354
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,000
stops before a sexual assault
and then starts right back up again

355
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,880
as soon as that assault is over.

356
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,640
I personally do not agree
with that.

357
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,480
But even if ending legal abortion
is your ultimate goal,

358
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,440
there are many conservative judges
who could deliver that to you

359
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,840
without all of Kavanaugh's issues.

360
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,000
Purely as a judge, there is nothing
unique about Kavanaugh. Nothing.

361
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,480
He's not uniquely qualified.
Trump reportedly picked him

362
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,480
from a list of 25 names provided by
groups like the Federalist Society,

363
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,280
whose executive vice president
pointed out he had no preference.

364
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,920
- A leading contender for you ?
- No. There's not.

365
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,240
- The list is really good.
- They're not in order ?

366
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,760
You can throw a dart at that list
and in my view you'd be fine.

367
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,120
He answered that question
about Supreme Court justices

368
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,560
like he was asked which pickle
in a jar is his favorite pickle.

369
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,400
I dunno, man.
They're all pickles.

370
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,680
It's a pickle jar, so if it's in
this jar, it's a fucking pickle.

371
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,520
The Republican leadership is continuing
to push Kavanaugh hard.

372
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,480
Lindsey Graham seemed to view
Kavanaugh with even more relish.

373
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,680
I've never felt better about him
being on the bench than I do now.

374
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,600
Really ? You feel better now
than before Kavanaugh testified ?

375
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,440
Do you really mean that, or are you
afraid that if you don't say it,

376
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,080
Kavanaugh will challenge you
to a fight on a boat in Rhode Island ?

377
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,240
Because I do get that.
He seems like the type.

378
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:57,600
After all of this,
I cannot see a single good reason

379
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,720
for pushing Kavanaugh
over a replacement candidate.

380
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:06,400
Any judge they choose is certainly
going to restrict abortion rights.

381
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,040
You don't need to choose an unhinged
partisan with multiple accusations

382
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,440
of sexual misconduct
hanging over him.

383
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,760
It feels like they're doing this just
to deliver a "fuck you" to Democrats

384
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,400
and even more directly,
a "fuck you" to women.

385
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,400
When this week began,
the biggest fear for many

386
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,160
was that the committee would not
believe Christine Blasey Ford.

387
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,080
But by the time the week ended,
something darker might have happened,

388
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,200
'cause it seemed their response was:
"We believe you. We just don't care."

389
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:43,560
She knew this was a possibility.
She said so during her testimony.

390
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,800
Once he was selected
and it seemed like he was popular

391
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:52,040
and it was a sure vote,
I was calculating daily

392
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:56,120
the risk benefit for me
of coming forward

393
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,960
and wondering whether I would
be jumping in front of a train

394
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,680
that was headed to where
it was headed anyway

395
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,160
and that I would just be
personally annihilated.

396
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,000
She knew publicly reliving the most
traumatic event of her life

397
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,160
could have no effect
and yet she spoke up anyway.

398
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,200
It is incredible the lengths
that some people will go to

399
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,040
for a free polygraph test.

400
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,480
Here's the thing...

401
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,000
I am not saying
that this is a done deal just yet.

402
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,520
They were desperately pushing
Kavanaugh through on Friday,

403
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,360
only for pressure to force
the reopening of the FBI investigation.

404
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,520
Which may well end up being so limited
as to be essentially pointless.

405
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,920
Only continued pressure
has even the slightest chance

406
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,240
of stopping Kavanaugh's confirmation.

407
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,960
And if he does, as seems
increasingly likely,

408
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:00,480
we should never forget how that
happened, or what he represents.

409
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,440
We will not forget it on this show.
You may know that, for years,

410
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:08,880
we've had an all-dog Supreme Court,
from Samuel Alito

411
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,640
to Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

412
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,520
Right, good dog !
Don't die.

413
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,320
Good dog. Sit and don't die !

414
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,880
Since 2017, it's been
a mostly dog Supreme Court,

415
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,040
because Neil Gorsuch
is represented on it by a lobster.

416
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,320
That's because his seat was
stolen from Merrick Garland.

417
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,320
Therefore, like a lobster,
he does not belong there.

418
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,240
But Kavanaugh,
if he is seated,

419
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,960
deserves something that
constantly reminds people who he is:

420
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,880
something hostile, unsettling,
temperamentally unpleasant

421
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,080
and that screams: "who
the fuck allowed this to happen ?"

422
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,880
I pray that we will not have to
use this, but if we do,

423
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,160
I see no more fitting embodiment
of Kavanaugh than this.

424
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,280
Yes, that's right.
Just as the actual Supreme Court

425
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,200
should not have
to deal with Kavanaugh,

426
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,720
our animal Supreme Court should
not have to deal with

427
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,920
this mutated carpet swatch that
appears to be tweaking on bath salts.

428
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,080
I hope it does not come to this.
There is a chance we can stop it.

429
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,600
Call your senators tomorrow
and tell them you do not want

430
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,080
to be looking at this
for the next 30 years.

431
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,920
Get off the bench !
You're not even confirmed yet !

432
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,560
No, I don't want a beer,
you big weirdo !

433
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,120
Get off that bench,
you entitled monster !

434
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,480
That is our show !
Thank you for watching.

435
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:45,280
We will see you next week,
good night ! You're terrible !

436
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,960
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

437
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,760
END OF EPISODE 24,
SEASON V
