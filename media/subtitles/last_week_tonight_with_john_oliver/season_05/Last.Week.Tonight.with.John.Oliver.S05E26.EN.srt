00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,960
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,480
SEASON V
EPISODE 26

3
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,320
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,360
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,080
After the ralph-inducing devil's
triangle that was last week,

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,960
it would have been nice if things
had been better this week.

7
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,000
But they weren't.
The UN released a climate report

8
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,720
that said we may only have
two good decades left,

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,720
that study was co-signed by one
of the strongest hurricanes in the US,

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,120
then whatever this was happened,
and then there was this.

11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,480
Neil Armstrong...
He's the man that planted the flag.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,360
Think of that,
on the face of the moon.

13
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,320
He planted that flag, that American
flag, right on the face of the moon.

14
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,480
There was no kneeling. There was
no nothing, there was no games.

15
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,640
There was no games.

16
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,080
How are you tying the NFL
protests to Neil Armstrong ?

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,920
There was no kneeling, but also:
no one was playing the National Anthem,

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,960
no football game scheduled
in the Sea of Tranquility.

19
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,720
No black astronauts had recently
been shot by moon cops

20
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,200
so none of the essential ingredients
had come together at that point.

21
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,200
Trump was at that rally because
he was trying to whip up enthusiasm

22
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,560
ahead of the midterms, which are
now less than a month away.

23
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,200
The ads are starting to roll out,
and some are pro-Trump,

24
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,040
like this one, from Florida
gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis.

25
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,960
My husband Ron DeSantis is endorsed
by President Trump,

26
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,000
but he's also an amazing dad.

27
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,040
Ron loves playing with the kids.

28
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,320
Build the wall.

29
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,200
He's teaching Madison to talk.

30
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,280
Make America great again.

31
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,880
He reads stories.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,360
Then Mr. Trump said:
"you're fired". I love that part.

33
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,720
That's borderline child abuse
and second:

34
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,040
he produced an ad essentially saying

35
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,800
"President's slogans are fairy tales
for naive infant children"

36
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,040
and somehow
intended it in a good way.

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,760
That ad is a rare
example of positive messaging.

38
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,760
There is a concern that this year's
campaigning is getting too nasty.

39
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,000
Holder faced criticism after suggesting
Democrats change their motto

40
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,000
from "when they go low,
we go high"

41
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,040
to "when they go low,
we kick 'em."

42
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,360
A massive pivot on political
messaging and also happens to be

43
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,640
my strategy
for dealing with squirrels.

44
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,280
When they go low,
I kick 'em.

45
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,000
When they go high,
I swat 'em.

46
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,560
And if they swarm, I do a
move I like to call "helicopter fists".

47
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,360
Trump,
the Grand Wizard of civil discourse,

48
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,680
called Holder's comments "disgusting"
which is ridiculous coming from him.

49
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,080
It's hypocritical
from the Republican Party in general.

50
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,160
The day after Trump said that,

51
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,240
their candidate for Pennsylvania
governor said this.

52
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,040
Governor Wolf, between now
and November 6th,

53
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,640
you better put a catcher's mask
on your face

54
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,200
because I'm gonna stomp
all over your face with golf spikes

55
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,120
because I'm gonna win this
for Pennsylvania

56
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,880
and we're throwing you out of office
because I'm tired of your negative ads.

57
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,240
Jesus Christ !

58
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,800
How can you be "anti-negative ads"
when your entire ad feels like

59
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,040
a man getting
into a fight in a garage ?

60
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,760
Put on a catcher's mitt, because
I'm gonna stomp on your face,

61
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,160
pin you down with a leaf rake,
jam your feet into a snow blower

62
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,840
and run you all over with
my wife's 2015 Volvo SW,

63
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,960
you worthless piece of shit,
let's raise the tone here, asshole !

64
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,920
I'm not a fan of attack ads.
They are never pretty.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,240
Every once in a while, someone comes
and elevates the form.

66
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,000
And my favorite ad
was one in Texas,

67
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,440
which strikes
at the essential essence of Ted Cruz.

68
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,920
Somebody left something
on my door the other day,

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,080
it said:
"Ted Cruz is Tough as Texas".

70
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,840
If somebody called my wife a dog,

71
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,840
and said my daddy
was in on the Kennedy assassination,

72
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,920
I wouldn't be kissing their ass.

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,920
You drag their ass out by the woodshed
and kick their ass, Ted.

74
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,480
Come on... Ted.

75
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,280
Come on, it's just his name,
and yet somehow, that final "Ted"

76
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,280
might be the meanest thing
ever said about Ted Cruz.

77
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,760
That ad could've had the same impact
if it were just three seconds long.

78
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,960
Come on... Ted.

79
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,920
See ? That gets
the point across perfectly.

80
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,560
That man is an assassin
whose weapon is his voice,

81
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,200
and I am confident there is
nothing he could not destroy,

82
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,440
simply by saying its name
with full Texas contempt.

83
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,080
The reason I am so confident
about that is,

84
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,800
we tracked that man down
and put it to the test.

85
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,720
The Man From The Ted Cruz Ad Says
8 More Names With Total Contempt.

86
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,080
Ed Sheeran.
Diane Keaton.

87
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,120
Banksy. Madonna.

88
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,680
Labradoodle. Cher.

89
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,760
Lobster Fest.

90
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,320
John Oliver.

91
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,040
John Oliver ? Come on, John !

92
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,960
Moving on.

93
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,760
So, our main story tonight
concerns Saudi Arabia.

94
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,240
Birthplace of the prophet
Muhammad. The prophet Muhammad.

95
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,160
Our graphics department must have
decided against that one.

96
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,200
Saudi Arabia has been
in the news this week,

97
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,600
for an appalling reason, it has to do
with Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi,

98
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,520
U.S. resident and columnist
for "Washington Post",

99
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,200
not seen since
he stepped into Saudi consulate

100
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,640
in Turkey to pick up
paperwork 12 days ago.

101
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,960
Jamal Khashoggi, captured
on closed-circuit cameras

102
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,240
stepping into what authorities
believe was a death trap.

103
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,200
Turkish authorities identified
15 Saudi men as persons of interest.

104
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,440
Hours before
Khashoggi went missing,

105
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,880
several of them were caught on
camera arriving in Istanbul.

106
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,440
A Turkish official tells
"The New York Times"

107
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,640
Saudi agents had "dismembered
his body with a bone saw."

108
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,680
It's horrific.
And the Saudis deny it happened.

109
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,640
Although let us all agree on this:

110
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,200
a bone saw, in any context,
is an immediate red flag.

111
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,360
Thanks for inviting me
over for Thanksgiving, Craig.

112
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,240
The turkey's delicious,
the stuffing is perfect,

113
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,920
that's a very large bone saw,
and I remembered I have to leave now.

114
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,880
Saudi officials scrambled to explain
all the suspicious activity,

115
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,760
with the Saudi-owned
channel Al Arabiya claiming

116
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,600
that the 15 people who turned up
in Istanbul were just tourists.

117
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,080
Which is clearly bullshit,
given that flight logs showed

118
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,480
that most of the men arrived on
a private charter plane at 3:13

119
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,640
and that all of them departed
the same day they arrived.

120
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,640
Which is a pretty weird vacation !

121
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,320
I want to see Istanbul, but only for
a few hours, mostly at night,

122
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,080
and I need
to bring my bone saw.

123
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,440
The "we were just tourists" excuse
isn't even a new one.

124
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,400
In the wake of Russia's
poisoning of Sergei Skripal,

125
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,440
the suspects
tried the same thing.

126
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,240
What were you doing there ?

127
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,400
Our friends had been suggesting
that we visit this wonderful town.

128
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,520
Salisbury, a wonderful town ?

129
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,880
Yes.

130
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,960
There's the famous Salisbury cathedral,
famous in the whole world.

131
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,200
It's famous for its 123-meter spire.
It's famous for its clock,

132
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,040
the one of the first ever created
in the world that's still working.

133
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,920
I love how
the reporter became suspicious

134
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,760
when they called Salisbury
"a wonderful town".

135
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,680
It's like if you heard someone
call celery "a delicious treat".

136
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't know what else
you're not telling the truth about,

137
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
but now I know
you're a fucking liar.

138
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,440
Second: "it's famous
for its 123-meter spire ?"

139
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,560
They sound like they're reading
off the Wikipedia page for Salisbury.

140
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,640
Why do I love Salisbury ?
Simple.

141
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,360
The population is 40 302 and their
Member of Parliament is John Glenn,

142
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,720
a conservative whose eight-year tenure
has been viewed as a failure,

143
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,240
open brackets, citation needed,
close brackets.

144
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,720
For all the Saudi denials, things are
not looking good right now,

145
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,160
as the Turkish government reportedly
have proof of the assassination.

146
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,040
This story is incredibly grim.

147
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,840
While this may be the first that
you have heard of Jamal Khashoggi,

148
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,000
he has long been a significant
figure in Saudi Arabia,

149
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,240
a thoughtful, and by no means radical
critic of the Saudi royal family.

150
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,000
The only reason to kill a journalist
in your own consulate

151
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,200
with 15 people and a bone saw
you flew in that day,

152
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,400
is 'cause you wanted to send a message
and you were sure you could get away.

153
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,800
Which raises the question:
why would they be so sure ?

154
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,600
And part of that answer
may have to do with us.

155
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,240
Let's take a look at America's
relationship with Saudi Arabia.

156
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,000
We have a long
and morally compromised history.

157
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,040
For decades, we have had a relationship
based on strategic interests,

158
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,520
not shared values:
they have oil, we need it.

159
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,640
They opposed Iran, and so did we.
And for those and other reasons,

160
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,800
U.S. presidents have been willing
to pander to Saudi Arabia.

161
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,640
In doing so, we've conveniently turned
a blind eye to a lot of things,

162
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,880
from human rights abuses to
the Saudi leadership's role

163
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,160
in funding religious extremism, even
while partnering with us to fight it.

164
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,280
It's always been
a very complicated relationship,

165
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,480
but in the last years, it's gotten
closer, thanks to two new leaders.

166
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,280
Trump and Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman.

167
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,560
And let's take the prince first.
Though his father is still alive,

168
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,760
since last year, the prince
has been running the country

169
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:51,720
and has branded himself as MBS,
the young, new face of Saudi Arabia.

170
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,960
He made the cover of "Time Magazine"

171
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,000
and "60 Minutes" profiled him as
a progressive voice for the country.

172
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,480
His reforms inside Saudi Arabia
have been revolutionary.

173
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,560
He is emancipating women,
introducing music and cinema

174
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,640
and cracking down on corruption.

175
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,120
There is some truth to that.

176
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,720
He's attempted to reduce the
influence of hard-line clerics,

177
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,520
he has agreed to let women drive

178
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,480
and he's allowed movie theaters
after a 35-year ban.

179
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,120
One of the very first movies
they showed there

180
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,600
was "The Emoji Movie".

181
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,320
Which is actually how it was
always supposed to be seen:

182
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,120
by a group of people who had never
seen a good movie to compare it to.

183
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,440
All of that has been combined
with a major plan

184
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,800
to re-orient the Saudi economy
away from oil and toward technology

185
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,360
called "Vision 2030".

186
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,080
MBS has gone on a world tour,

187
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,440
to reassure investors that
Saudi Arabia is stable and progressive

188
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,600
and that businesses should
feel comfortable with them.

189
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,320
He's taken meetings with Tim Cook,
Bill Gates and Richard Branson

190
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,280
and he's even had Starbucks
with Michael Bloomberg.

191
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,680
While the Starbucks baristas
nailed "Mohammed bin Salman",

192
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,320
Bloomberg still ended up with
a cup reading "Mikey Boom-Burp".

193
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:12,600
As part of his PR push, MBS started
an annual business conference,

194
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:17,520
the Future Investment Initiative,
or "Davos in the Desert".

195
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,920
The first was held
at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh,

196
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,680
featuring leaders
of many big-name companies,

197
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,520
and the usual futuristic
tech bullshit like this.

198
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,440
We have smart investors here

199
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,520
and they are very selective
about what they invest in.

200
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,440
I'm special. I can use my expressive
face to communicate with people.

201
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,200
But why is it important for you
to have an expressive face ?

202
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,120
Most of the time I feel positive.

203
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,880
God !
That is a creepy smile.

204
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,400
That's the exact same smile
that I've seen the Queen give

205
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,800
when she has to interact
with a commoner.

206
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,120
I believe you won some contest to
come to my house and look at things.

207
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,640
What a positive day
for one of us !

208
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,960
Don't touch anything !

209
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,200
But MBS's PR push isn't just
toward attracting businesses.

210
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,080
It's also toward changing the
world's perception of Saudi Arabia.

211
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,080
He struck a ten-year deal
with one of the most popular

212
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,480
and most American franchises,
World Wrestling Entertainment or WWE.

213
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,680
They held their first of many
events there back in April

214
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,280
and audiences around the world were
treated to wall-to-wall propaganda,

215
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,280
including a video showing women
happily driving, men dancing

216
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,680
and tourist destination
beauty shots,

217
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,640
as well as compliments
throughout the broadcast.

218
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,320
For the first time,

219
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,400
WWE bringing an event of this
magnitude to Saudi Arabia.

220
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,680
This vibrant, progressive city,
our host tonight.

221
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,320
It's all part
of the Saudi Vision 2030.

222
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,120
King Abdullah's sports city
stadium just got on its feet.

223
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,800
That area has been reserved
for the Saudi royal family.

224
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,760
I want to send a genuine thank you
to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

225
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:10,880
WWE is as overtly pro-Saudi Arabia
as it is latently homo-erotic.

226
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,320
Which is to say: intensely.

227
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,680
MBS is far from the political reformer
that he's been presented as.

228
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,240
Scratch any positive
story about him

229
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,960
and you will find a much
grimmer truth.

230
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,240
While the country did get headlines
for ending its ban on women driving,

231
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,400
weeks before, authorities arrested
about a dozen female activists

232
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,800
who'd campaigned
for the right to drive.

233
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,600
Even that investment conference
had a dark coda.

234
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,960
One week later, at the same hotel,
this happened.

235
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,120
New footage from inside
the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh,

236
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,680
shows the transformation from
a favorite haunt of the well-heeled

237
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,640
into arguably
the world's most luxurious prison.

238
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,280
MBS used that Ritz-Carlton
to lock up hundreds of businessmen

239
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,440
and members of the royal family in
a so-called anti-corruption campaign.

240
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,040
17 detainees were reportedly
hospitalized for physical abuse,

241
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,840
and one Saudi military officer
died in custody.

242
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,360
Which is insane and horrifying,
because the only hotel

243
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,920
where you expect to be
murdered is a Days Inn.

244
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,480
Hence their slogan: "Days Inn:
expect to be murdered here."

245
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,920
Bin Salman has been aggressive
with his neighbors,

246
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,840
launching a blockade of Qatar
that continues today,

247
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,400
as does an absolutely brutal war
in Yemen that has resulted

248
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,680
in over 16 000 casualties
and killed over 1 200 children.

249
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,240
The Saudi campaign of airstrikes
has been catastrophic,

250
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,920
as this man attested while standing
near what used to be his home.

251
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,560
Saudi Arabia bombs without care.

252
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,040
How many of your family
were killed ?

253
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,160
27 lives. 27 people.
From one family.

254
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,480
Any reason why your family and this
house might have been struck ?

255
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,240
I am not a leader or anything.
I work as a barber.

256
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,720
That's terrible.
At the very least,

257
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,360
there is no justification
for violence against a barber.

258
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:13,640
And that is coming from me.
If anyone has a justification,

259
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,720
it would be yours truly,
because of what they did to me.

260
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,920
As all of this has happened,
our current president continued

261
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,720
to accommodate
and ignore bin Salman's excesses.

262
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:36,680
After that clampdown on corruption at
the Ritz-Carlton, many sounded alarm.

263
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,560
Trump went the other way.

264
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,320
Trump endorsed bin Salman's new
corruption crackdown, tweeting:

265
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,680
"I have great confidence in King Salman
and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia,"

266
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,560
"they know
what they are doing."

267
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,400
Right. Just because they know
what they're doing

268
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,080
doesn't mean
that what they're doing is good.

269
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,800
Michael Jordan knew what he was doing
when he wore this mustache.

270
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,640
He was seeing how far this whole
Michael Jordan thing could take him

271
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,960
and the answer was apparently:
through Hitler and beyond.

272
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,080
That fits with the larger pattern
of Donald Trump and Saudi Arabia,

273
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,560
'cause since taking office,
he has catered to them at every turn.

274
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,760
He made Saudi Arabia the first foreign
country he visited as president

275
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,040
and he seemed to have
a great time there.

276
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,120
Dancing with a sword and famously
groping a weird glowing orb.

277
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,680
After which I assume Michael Cohen
offered the orb $130 000

278
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,240
and told it to keep quiet.

279
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,520
It shouldn't be that surprising

280
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,040
that Trump embraced
the Saudi royal family.

281
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,280
They have the two qualities
he admires most in the world:

282
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,800
having a lot of money
and giving it to him.

283
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,800
He basically said as much
on the campaign trail.

284
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,960
Saudi Arabia. And I get along
great with all of them.

285
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,080
They buy apartments from me.
They spend fifty million.

286
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,800
I like them very much.

287
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:05,800
Buying an apartment from Trump is
a surefire way to get him to like you,

288
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,840
along with wearing one
of his hats,

289
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,600
being under 25 years old
with a size 32-double-D

290
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,240
and not being Eric.

291
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,680
He's a simple man
with simple tastes.

292
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,920
Trump's businessman view
of the Saudis as just

293
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,760
"people with money,
don't ask too many questions"

294
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,160
has carried over
now that he's president.

295
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,680
When bin Salman
came to the White House,

296
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,880
Trump boasted about the amount
of arms that they were buying from us,

297
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,600
essentially using MBS
as a human easel.

298
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,120
Some of the things that have been
approved and are under construction

299
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,440
and will be delivered
to Saudi Arabia very soon

300
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,440
and that's for their protection,
but if you look, in terms of dollars,

301
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,320
$3 billion, $533 million,

302
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,960
$525 million,
that's peanuts for you.

303
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,520
$880 million, $645 million,

304
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,400
$6 billion, that's for frigates.

305
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:15,080
Has any human in the history
more obviously just learned a word

306
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,720
than he just learned
the word "frigates" ?

307
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,920
Look at bin Salman's face, as it hits
him just how much Trump likes money.

308
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,920
It's like the face of a babysitter

309
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,720
who realized you can pacify a kid
with Twizzlers.

310
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,720
I thought this was gonna be difficult,
but if all you want is Twizzlers,

311
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,080
I've got loads of them, take all
you want and shut the fuck up.

312
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,160
I am by no means saying
that Trump is the first U.S. president

313
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,880
to make distasteful
arms deals with the Saudis.

314
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,640
We've been doing it for decades.
Obama still sold them weapons,

315
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,440
even as Saudi Arabia
got involved in Yemen.

316
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,520
Trump has continued doing so,

317
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,320
even as signs mount
of Saudi recklessness.

318
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,880
They dropped an American-made bomb
on a school bus full of children,

319
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,800
but a month later, Trump's Defense
Secretary said that Saudi Arabia

320
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,000
was doing everything it could
to prevent civilian casualties.

321
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,280
Trump has gone out of his way
to accommodate the Saudis.

322
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,240
He doesn't even have
an ambassador to the kingdom.

323
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,000
Our relationship with them is being
handled personally by Jared.

324
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,800
Ivanka Trump's real doll.

325
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:31,480
The Saudis seem understandably
very happy with that situation.

326
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,360
Kushner took an unannounced
trip to Saudi Arabia in 2017

327
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,160
to meet with the young prince.

328
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,840
MBS boasted Kushner was "in his
pocket", which bin Salman denied.

329
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,640
Of course he's in their pocket.
He's fucking Jared.

330
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,560
That face was born
to be maneuvered.

331
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,280
His Secret Service nickname is
"wallet, keys and a bit of lint".

332
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,400
While the fact that the U.S. has
enabled Saudi Arabia is nothing new,

333
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:05,400
the extent to which Trump
is prioritizing money is dangerous.

334
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,400
Is it any wonder that they
have been emboldened here ?

335
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,960
After MBS's roundup of his rivals,
Trump tweeted his support.

336
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,640
After his blockade of Qatar,
Trump took credit for it

337
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,120
and that kind
of shit has consequences.

338
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,440
Trump has chosen extreme
friendliness with MBS,

339
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,640
a leader who,  in the words
of one Saudi critic, has created

340
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,400
a "climate of fear and intimidation"
going on: "we Saudis deserve better".

341
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,320
That critic was Jamal Khashoggi.
The journalist who is widely thought

342
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,960
to have been murdered
in the Saudi consulate.

343
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,200
While Trump said Saudi Arabia
faces "severe punishment"

344
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,320
if it's proven they were behind this,

345
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,120
does anyone believe that is something
he's honestly committed to ?

346
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,080
A more revealing response
came in the Oval Office,

347
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,960
after the news of Khashoggi's
disappearance broke.

348
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,080
Watch him render the costbenefit
analysis he was applying.

349
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,600
Again, this took place in Turkey

350
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,400
and, to the best of our knowledge,
Khashoggi is not a US citizen.

351
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,280
Is that right, or, is that right ?
He's a permanent resident, okay.

352
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,840
We don't like it, John,
we don't like it even a little bit,

353
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,360
but as to whether or not we should
stop a hundred and ten billion dollars

354
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:23,160
from being spent in this country,
knowing they have five alternatives,

355
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,080
that would not be
acceptable to me.

356
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,880
He is openly demonstrating
to the entire world

357
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,960
and to Saudi Arabia specifically,

358
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,800
that arms deal... much more important
than butchered journalist.

359
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,080
Giving Saudi Arabia green lights
for two solid years had consequences

360
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,080
and a lot of people now have
big decisions to make.

361
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,040
The second "Davos in the Desert"
begins nine days from now

362
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,640
and all of these companies
have pulled out,

363
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,800
although as of now, Steve Mnuchin
is still planning to attend.

364
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,520
The desert is comfortably hot enough
without that smokeshow.

365
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,880
Am I right ? Smokeshow, right ?
He can get it.

366
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,960
That's a "fuck me" face.
Am I right on that ?

367
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,520
As for the WWE, while they say
they are "monitoring the situation",

368
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,080
their gigantic Crown Jewel event
is scheduled for November.

369
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,040
John Cena could be back there,
doing this, which in this context

370
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,680
would mean "you don't see these
human rights abuses right here."

371
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,000
As for the president,
every U.S. leader has chosen

372
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,880
to make compromises
when it comes to Saudi Arabia.

373
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,360
Trump may well be the first
who doesn't see it as a compromise.

374
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,720
Because he and MBS are similar
in some of the worst possible ways.

375
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,880
They love money. They're
a product of inherited wealth.

376
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,560
Love self-promotion,
yet disdain the press.

377
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,360
They share a design
aesthetic that amounts to

378
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,160
"Elvis tries to remember what
Versailles looks like, but can't."

379
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,800
Trump's intense bromance
with MBS is bad news.

380
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,840
When you set no boundaries
on an oppressive regime,

381
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,920
they are always going to ask: "how
much can we get away with here ?"

382
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:11,120
As we saw this week, the answer
to that may be: pretty much anything.

383
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,040
And now this.

384
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,600
Footage Of Happy
People Doing Happy Things,

385
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,000
To Distract You From
Horrifying Drug Side Effects.

386
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,400
Serious side effects,
including pancreatitis.

387
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,680
Common side effects are nausea,
diarrhea, vomiting.

388
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,720
Chest-pain, shortness of breath,
diarrhea, severe stomach pain.

389
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,400
Tiredness, loss of appetite,
and bleeding or bruising easily.

390
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,040
Aggression, hostility,
depressed mood.

391
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,320
Dizziness, cough,
ankle swelling.

392
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,560
Other side effects:
gas, stomach pain.

393
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,640
Sleepwalking or allergic
and skin reactions.

394
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,440
May cause skin to turn
yellow or orange.

395
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,880
Large or painful breasts,
blood clots in the legs.

396
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Blood clots that can lead
to death.

397
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,040
Extreme fatigue, constipation,
swollen ankles, loss of appetite,

398
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,680
confusion, hallucinations.

399
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,600
Infections, tiredness, nausea,
sore mouth, diarrhea,

400
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,640
vomiting, rash
and loss of appetite.

401
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,520
Alice calls it her new normal.

402
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:20,400
And finally tonight, Instagram.
The place you go to have

403
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,040
your most transformative life
experiences rated by strangers.

404
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,040
Only 96 likes ?
Better luck next baby.

405
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,880
Just last month,
Instagram had some dramatic news.

406
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,400
The co-founders of Instagram are
resigning from the popular platform.

407
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,040
Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger
said they plan to leave Instagram

408
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,720
to: "explore our curiosity
and creativity again."

409
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,440
This is a shockeroo
in this industry.

410
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,320
Absolutely. Big move.

411
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,040
Gayle, if I can quickly correct you,
the only "shockeroo" in Silicon Valley

412
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,280
is Elon Musk's
patented sex machine.

413
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,640
This was just a regular old surprise.
Sleep well everyone, nighty night.

414
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:05,880
While it is too soon to say what
this might mean for Instagram,

415
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,840
I do hope that it won't stop them
from fulfilling their primary function

416
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,440
which is providing an outlet for people
to express themselves.

417
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,640
Go to my Instagram,
I'd love to hear from you.

418
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,440
You can go straight to my Instagram
page @AriMelber on Instagram.

419
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,600
Tweet me or
go to my Instagram page.

420
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,520
Catch my story on Instagram.

421
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,160
Don't forget,
judge underscore Jeanine.

422
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,440
An adult asking you
to follow them on social media

423
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,120
gives off the same vibe as a clown
asking you to join him in a sewer.

424
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,800
I don't know what you're doing there,
but I don't want to join you.

425
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,800
If you do choose to follow
news anchors on Instagram,

426
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,520
a whole world of sad
wonder awaits you.

427
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,240
Anderson Cooper and Brooke Baldwin
post pictures of their dogs.

428
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,240
Like posting pictures of your kids,
except other people enjoy it too.

429
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,080
John Dickerson also
posts photos with his dog,

430
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,880
in which he winds up looking
like a serial killer.

431
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,960
Others go in a weirder direction.
CNN's Don Lemon

432
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:13,680
has made a habit of posting not one,
but three videos of fireplaces,

433
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,200
which is a complete waste
of his and everyone's time.

434
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,320
Mika Brzezinski, whose Instagram
shows you that she has a pet pig,

435
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,440
something she likes to
show off, to horrifying effect.

436
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,800
She might get mad at me, but I'll
give you one last look at her tummy.

437
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,800
She's a big girl !
She's got a big tummy !

438
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,440
Put the pig down !
Put that fucking pig down !

439
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:55,240
I never thought I would say this
in a non-Joe Scarborough context,

440
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,800
but Mika Brzezinski,
step away from the pig !

441
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,640
I understand the mistake.
You go to pick up your pig

442
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:08,240
and the pig reacts by screaming
like a banshee with a stubbed toe.

443
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,880
The key is, you learn
your lesson from it

444
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,680
and you never,
ever do it again.

445
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,800
I'm gonna make a gif.

446
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,840
What are you doing, Mika ?
That's not how gif's work.

447
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,400
"A", they're silent,

448
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,520
and "B", they tend not to be
heavy on the pig torture.

449
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,840
There is the host of ABC's World
News Tonight, David Muir,

450
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,640
whose Instagram is littered with him
doing his best "blue steel".

451
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,240
Here he is, staring
down a hurricane.

452
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,320
Here he is, posing on a plane,
here he is, flexing on a plane,

453
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,760
and waiting outside a restaurant
looking like Ross from "Friends",

454
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,680
if instead of falling in love with
Rachel he fell in love with himself.

455
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,240
But the single greatest
cable news Instagrammer,

456
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,440
and I do not
mean that as a compliment,

457
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,480
has to be CNN's Chris Cuomo,
who is constantly posting videos

458
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,040
with fun peeks
behind the scenes of his show.

459
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,520
Like with this makeup, the truth
can be concealed and covered up.

460
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,000
That's with the spin
about these Russia developments.

461
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,120
We're gonna focus on what
really matters: u-n-i-t-y.

462
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,240
I wrote it this way because I wanted it
to be hard for you to catch it.

463
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,040
News time !

464
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,640
Cool.

465
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,200
We should all just stay tuned
while Chris Cuomo fights the news.

466
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,520
You may be wondering: who is
holding the camera there ?

467
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,400
if it's anything like his other
workplace videos,

468
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,520
the answer is his poor producer,
Rose.

469
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,520
We're getting ready
to start the show, Rose.

470
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,120
Rose, here's what
we should talk about today.

471
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,280
Rose, you forgot to tell people
we're going to be on TV tonight.

472
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:28,440
They searched the offices
of the president's lawyer.

473
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,000
This is a storm, Rose.
See the lightning ?

474
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,800
It's a factory, Rose.
That's an Easter egg, Rose.

475
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,360
Look at all the snow, Rose.
The snow has stopped.

476
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,760
Thank you for coming along,
not you, Rose, that's your job.

477
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,040
We all got to the first base of
sexual harassment with Chris Cuomo.

478
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:59,520
The oddest feature of Chris Cuomo's
Instagram is videos of him working out.

479
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,880
There are many videos of him
lifting, sweating and grunting.

480
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,720
Far be it from me to judge
Chris Cuomo,

481
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,240
his triceps are wider
than my entire body.

482
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,680
But something about his
thirst-pit of an Instagram

483
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:17,200
feels a little desperate for approval
no more so than with his efforts

484
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,240
to get his catchphrase to happen.

485
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,760
Just getting
a little preshow pump.

486
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,560
- What does that say ?
- Cuomo Primetime.

487
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,240
Hashtag let's get after it.

488
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,640
What do you say ?
Let's get after it !

489
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,040
Let's get after it !

490
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,080
What do you say ?
Let's get after it !

491
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,960
Instead of doing that, let's
get after that catchphrase.

492
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,480
Let's hunt it down, catch it
and kill it forever.

493
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,480
For all my criticism,
this has actually inspired me.

494
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:54,360
I'm kind of on TV.
I should be using Instagram.

495
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,880
Instead of a Cuomo style account,
which makes you feel shitty

496
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,640
about your physical fitness and
your lack of a sidekick named Rose,

497
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,320
I'm gonna capture the hearts
and minds of people

498
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,480
who do not want to get after it,
because they're tired.

499
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,760
This is why I'm kicking off the
"Let's Not Get After It" challenge.

500
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,440
You take a picture of your body
functioning totally ageappropriately,

501
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,080
and you post it using the hashtag
#let's not get after it.

502
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,200
I already put a few on our show's
Instagram page to get the ball rolling.

503
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,920
Here's a video of me winded after
climbing a medium number of stairs.

504
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,200
#LetsNotGetAfterIt" #BreatheMode",
#IShouldntHaveHustledSoMuch.

505
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,840
Here's another one of me
struggling to open a jar

506
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,560
before handing it to someone stronger,
who then opens it easily.

507
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,760
I'm giving that
the hashtag #LetsNotGetAfterIt"

508
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,360
#ALittleHelpFromMyFriends"
#OkayButILoosenedItThough.

509
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,040
Here's one final video I posted:
that's me not lifting a pig,

510
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,800
because the pig doesn't like it.

511
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,240
#LetsNotGetAfterIt"
#ThatsHowYouDontLiftAPig.

512
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,960
I am challenging you,
the viewers, to take to Instagram

513
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,920
and get after it only as much as
is comfortable and appropriate for you.

514
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,080
That is our show, thanks for watching,
we'll see you next week, good night !

515
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,600
I'm not gonna pick you up.

516
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,280
I sense you don't want to be picked up
so I shall not pick you up.

517
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,000
We can just sit here,
man and pig. Yeah ?

518
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,400
You want to go over there ?
You can go over there.

519
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,080
I won't pick you up and bring you
back over here

520
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,760
'cause I sense you want to be
somewhere different from where I am.

521
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,360
I often feel that way.

522
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,960
Here's what I'm not gonna do.
That. 'Cause you didn't want it.

523
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,160
