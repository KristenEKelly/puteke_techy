00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,310
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,480
SEASON V
EPISODE 30

3
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,440
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,360
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,320
A quick recap of the week.
And we begin with President Trump,

6
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,450
the most racist president since we
decided presidents shouldn't be racist.

7
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,510
Trump had a week of responding
to things in a non-ideal manner,

8
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,440
from calling Saudi Arabia
a "spectacular ally"

9
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,470
after the CIA implicated Mohammed
bin Salman in a journalist's killing,

10
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,530
to touring the devastation
following the California wildfires.

11
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,310
Seeing this devastation change
your opinion on climate change?

12
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,440
No. I have a strong opinion.

13
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,410
I want great climate
and we're going to have that.

14
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,240
"I want great climate."

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,410
Trump inserts whatever noun
someone just said

16
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,420
into his stock bullshit answers.

17
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,220
What's your opinion
on SpongeBob SquarePants?

18
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,420
I want great SpongeBob,
we're gonna have that.

19
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,340
It's gonna be the spongiest Bob,
and we love it.

20
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,420
The pants that are square?
We love them.

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,280
Trump was affected by what happened
in Paradise, California,

22
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,390
whose residential areas
were nearly 90 percent destroyed.

23
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:42,270
What he saw there,
in Paradise, California,

24
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,280
is something he will never forget.

25
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,320
You don't see what's going on
until you come here.

26
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,300
What we saw at Pleasure,
what a name, right now.

27
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,380
But what we just saw.
We just left Pleasure...

28
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,370
- Paradise.
- Or Paradise.

29
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,310
You have to remember the name.
You were just there!

30
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,700
The most amazing part of that
is not just the predictable mistake.

31
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,790
It's the face of the Governor
of California as it unfolds.

32
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,800
What we saw at Pleasure...
What a name, right now.

33
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,600
- We just left Pleasure...
- Paradise.

34
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,600
You can see it hitting him,
thinking:

35
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,720
"let it go, he only said it once,
no way he'll say it again".

36
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,650
Then realizing: "fuck it,
we're gonna have to do something."

37
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,770
"Fuck it, we're gonna have
to do something"

38
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,760
should be the title of every
history of the Trump era.

39
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,590
Trump's weirdest unforced error was
during a Medal of Freedom ceremony,

40
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,730
where, in honoring
the late Antonin Scalia,

41
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,820
he abandoned the prepared text,
see if you can spot where.

42
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,600
Joining us for this ceremony
is his wife Maureen,

43
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,650
who's become a great friend of
my family, myself,

44
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:01,770
and their nine children: Ann, Gene,
John, Catherine, Mary Clare,

45
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,390
Paul, Matthew,
Christopher and Meg.

46
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,510
You were very busy.

47
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,430
I always knew I liked him.

48
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,500
What are you doing,
you strange man?

49
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,370
You're saying:
"I liked your dead husband,"

50
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,340
"I like people who fuck
a lot, because I fuck a lot."

51
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,450
I made a speech about your dead
husband about me fucking a lot.

52
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,540
Sorry for your loss,
come get your medal.

53
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,390
Instead of getting bogged
down again in Trump,

54
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,410
let's instead talk about Brexit.

55
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,580
A name way too cute for something
so destructively stupid.

56
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,370
It's like hearing your friend
decided to shove a snake

57
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,550
up what he insists
on calling his "snasshole".

58
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,480
You don't get a portmanteau!

59
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,500
You did something very stupid
and I want my snake back!

60
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,400
Two years ago,
Britain voted to leave the EU.

61
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,400
Theresa May presented a draft deal
for how that's going to happen.

62
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,410
It needs to pass through Parliament
and for a sense of how likely that is,

63
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,770
listen to the response
she got in the chamber.

64
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,620
It is a draft treaty that means
that we will leave the EU

65
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,860
in a smooth and orderly way
on the 29th of March, 2019.

66
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,840
Holy shit, they laughed in her face
at the concept of this going well.

67
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,750
I know that must've been
a humiliating moment for her,

68
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,860
but I still have to ask:

69
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,740
what was it like
getting a laugh in England?

70
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,710
Was it nice?
I bet it was nice.

71
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,730
I never managed it myself, but
in my dreams, it's always nice.

72
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,660
But the reason they're laughing
is that whatever Brexit is going to be,

73
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,840
it's going to be a shit show.

74
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,820
Picture a dozen toddlers
trying to split a check

75
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,860
or an orgy
in Italy organized by cats.

76
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,730
It's gonna
be that level of clusterfuck.

77
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,750
What's happening is complicated,
but let me explain:

78
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,790
politicians who wanted to remain in
EU hate this deal for obvious reasons.

79
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,790
Politicians who wanted
to leave also hate this deal,

80
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,340
it's not what they promised people,
which was that the EU would let Britain

81
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,500
leave with all the benefits of
membership and no consequences.

82
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,480
Pro-Brexit politicians are now
basically parents

83
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,530
who promised
their daughter a unicorn.

84
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,530
May is presenting them a horse with
an ice cream cone glued to its head

85
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,470
and they're saying:
"No! That's unacceptable!"

86
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,360
"Get our daughter a real unicorn
or she'll think we lied to her!"

87
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,390
But you did lie,
you fucking idiots,

88
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,360
so you'd better put a bow
on that ice-cream horse

89
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,480
or get ready
for a very hard conversation.

90
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,330
May's deal looked
doomed from the start,

91
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,330
as it had barely been announced
before this happened.

92
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,500
Prime Minister
Theresa May appears to be

93
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,380
growing politically weaker as seven
members of her own government quit.

94
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,480
Even Dominic Raab,

95
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,300
the person leading the Brexit
negations with Brussels, resigned.

96
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:58,440
The person who negotiated the deal
resigned because of how bad it is.

97
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,490
It's like if you woke up after major
surgery, and the surgeon told you

98
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,320
he quit being a doctor because
of how your operation went.

99
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,530
What the fuck happened?
What did you do?

100
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:14,530
The wheels are coming off.
And considering the pro-Brexit campaign

101
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,510
was criticized for a misleading use
of statistics,

102
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,580
it doesn't help matters that one
minister, Rory Stewart,

103
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,390
tried to sell the deal during
a radio interview like this.

104
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,610
The reason why 80 percent of
the British public support this deal

105
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,520
is because what it does...

106
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,510
80 percent of the British public
support this deal?

107
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,410
The draft deal? How on earth
do we know that yet?

108
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,490
- Let me back on that.
- Where did that 80 percent come from?

109
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,610
I'm producing a number to try
to illustrate what I believe.

110
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:49,590
Wait. You don't get to make up
numbers to show your feelings!

111
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,400
If you are gonna do that,
make up some fun ones.

112
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,390
Florty gerkillion percent of
the British public supports this deal,

113
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,590
that's threlve out of every
four-leventy-teen people in Britain.

114
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,380
When pollsters gave people
the options of May's deal,

115
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,420
no deal, or no Brexit at all, more
than half chose "no Brexit".

116
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,610
What happens is not clear.
Don't just take that from me.

117
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,630
Take it from someone
whose job it is to know this.

118
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,730
Where are we in all
of this Brexit process?

119
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,620
People like me are paid to have insight
and foresight and hindsight

120
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,590
about these things, and to be able
to project where we're going to go.

121
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,560
To be quite honest,
I haven't got the foggiest idea

122
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,650
what is gonna happen
in the coming weeks.

123
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,700
Is the prime minister gonna get
a deal with the EU? Dunno.

124
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,660
Is she gonna be able to get it
through the Commons? Don't know.

125
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,600
Yeah. I feel you, buddy.
Your glasses and your accent say:

126
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,700
"I have valuable information
to impart" but your words say:

127
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,740
"the world may have finally
slipped into a chaos so dark"

128
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,690
"that the only thing I can say
now is, dunno."

129
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,670
We are truly brothers,
outmatched British dweeb.

130
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,660
It's been quite a year.
So basically, no one has the foggiest.

131
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,610
The people of the UK aren't even
gonna be able to see this segment,

132
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,620
because we showed that House
of Commons clip earlier,

133
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,970
and, as we've discussed
before, in the UK,

134
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,960
it's illegal to use parliamentary
footage for the purposes of comedy,

135
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,950
even when the footage is of Parliament
literally laughing at someone.

136
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,020
Last time this happened, we replaced
the segment for UK viewers

137
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,050
with five minutes of Gilbert Gottfried
reading three-star Yelp reviews

138
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,980
of restaurants in Boise, Idaho,
as punishment.

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,910
The law in the UK hasn't changed,
so for viewers there,

140
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,880
it's gonna be Gilbert o'clock,
motherfuckers!

141
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:42,000
Rather than seeing this, people
in the UK are gonna have to watch

142
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:47,090
Gilbert reading extracts from
Theresa May's 585-page draft deal.

143
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,890
Here is just a little taste.

144
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:56,090
The provisions of union law
governing wholesale electricity markets

145
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,100
listed in Annex 7 to this protocol
shall apply,

146
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,940
under the conditions
set out therein.

147
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,080
It's not gonna be pleasant.
And the UK can't complain,

148
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,100
they brought this on themselves.

149
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,900
Who knows what is going
to happen with Brexit?

150
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,880
Some in the government claim
they'll renegotiate,

151
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,840
despite the fact the EU
says that is not happening.

152
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,940
Over half of the public now seem
to think Brexit's a bad idea,

153
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,900
but Theresa May ruled out
a second referendum.

154
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,840
The only thing I can say for sure
at this point

155
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,020
is that the chances of Brexit being
a complete shit-show next year

156
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,920
are approximately
4 trillion percent.

157
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,930
That's not based
on any studies or polls.

158
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,850
I'm just producing a number
to try to illustrate what I believe.

159
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,970
And now, this.

160
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:49,950
Some Clips That Have, To Put It
Mildly, Not Aged Well.

161
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,020
This is Piers Morgan Tonight.

162
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,850
I'm Harvey Weinstein,
filling in for Piers Morgan.

163
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,020
And I'm Matt Lauer
and I'm too old to have sex.

164
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,980
I love Matt Lauer, but my husband
Craig is my Matt Lauer.

165
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,950
Tell us who your dream teacher is,
tweet it, #dreamteacher.

166
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,890
I would go with Bill Cosby.

167
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,830
Bill Cosby is here, telling stories
from his latest book.

168
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,980
I am Mario Batali.

169
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,960
I more or less do whatever the hell
I want, whenever I want to.

170
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,020
A man with a plan!

171
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,080
I'm here at Soldier Creek Elementary
with Jared the "Subway Guy".

172
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,020
You've been an inspiration
to many people and to these kiddos.

173
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,960
Kevin Spacey, hello. When you do
the workshops with young people,

174
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,980
what are you trying
to convey to them?

175
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,920
I'm looking
for the shy kid.

176
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,900
I'm pleased to have Kevin Spacey
back at this table.

177
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,030
Charlie Rose called me and
said: "I want you to do the show".

178
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:49,920
If you say no to Charlie in New York,
your social life ends.

179
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,100
There's also this issue
of sexual harassment,

180
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:59,100
which is in lots of conversation,
lots of women coming forward.

181
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,940
A lot of talk about what
it means and where it's going.

182
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,910
Moving on. This is actually
our last show of the season.

183
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,180
For our main story,
we thought we'd pull back

184
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,070
and look at one of the biggest
questions that defined this year:

185
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,290
How good was "A Star Is Born?"

186
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:28,250
- I did see "A Star is Born".
- Yes! A great movie.

187
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,230
- And it was amazing?
- Amazing.

188
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,250
- It's still on my heart.
- Yeah, it lingers.

189
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,070
Bradley Cooper
had a hold of my soul.

190
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:42,090
It's beyond great.

191
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,260
Maybe it's time to
let the old ways die.

192
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:50,060
Bradley Cooper, my gosh! Tears!
Amazing! Go see the movie.

193
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,210
That guy loves it, and he's the center
for the Dallas Cowboys!

194
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,140
No one doesn't like
"A Star is Born"!

195
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,260
It's the one movie that even
Neil deGrasse Tyson can't ruin!

196
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,060
John, I had a small issue
with the film.

197
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,170
If you want to know how
a star is "actually" born,

198
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,160
you start with a gas cloud.

199
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,110
Shut up!

200
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,110
You shut up, Neil deGrasse Tyson!

201
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,230
Let this be the one thing about stars
you don't fucking ruin!

202
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,920
We're not talking about
"A Star Is Born" tonight.

203
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,960
We're gonna talk about the exact
opposite of that movie:

204
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,860
the troubling rise of authoritarian
leaders around the world.

205
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,820
There has been a lot of them.
The ones you instinctively think about,

206
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,770
like Putin and Xi Jinping, who've
been consolidating their power.

207
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,750
The re-election of strongmen
like Hungary's Orban

208
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,750
and Turkey's Erdogan,
and then there's what happened

209
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,950
last month in the world's
fifth largest country.

210
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,980
Brazil has a new president,

211
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,940
the latest nation
to elect a far-right leader.

212
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,840
Extreme right Bolsonaro has exalted
the country's military dictatorship,

213
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,830
advocated torture and threatened
to destroy, jail,

214
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,920
or drive his opponents
into exile, he's calling for unity.

215
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,850
That's nice,
he's calling for unity, is he?

216
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,840
He expressed an affection for torture
and dictatorship before that

217
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,830
and political platforms
are like Tinder profiles,

218
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,980
once you advocate torture, it doesn't
matter what else you say,

219
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,760
it's all people are gonna remember
and for good reason.

220
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,870
While no two authoritarian
leaders are the same,

221
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,020
the global trend toward them
is alarming.

222
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:27,000
In many cases,
people are actively choosing them.

223
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:32,970
One-third of the world's population
lives in a backsliding democracy.

224
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:38,050
You may have been watching the news
and found yourself saying:

225
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,870
"what is happening to the world
and why?"

226
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,870
Let's look at three common traits
authoritarian leaders tend to have,

227
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,980
to try and figure out what can
make them so appealing to people

228
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,900
and to what extent this country is
heading in the same direction.

229
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,990
The first trait
is projecting strength.

230
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,010
Authoritarians tend to love
grand displays of force,

231
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,930
like the military parades
featuring weaponry

232
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,850
that you see in China,
North Korea, Venezuela and Russia,

233
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,900
where they'll even sometimes throw
in a musical number.

234
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,830
Word of warning, Russia:

235
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,030
that's what musicals are like
when you don't allow gay people.

236
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:29,040
Experts will tell you that spectacles
like those serve a purpose,

237
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,080
as many authoritarians project
strength out of concern

238
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,890
that they may be seen
as illegitimate.

239
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,910
In the same way that a man
who is insecure about his penis

240
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:41,870
buys a motorcycle, takes up
bodybuilding, or invents the "Tesla".

241
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:46,980
How weird is your penis, Elon?
How weird is it?

242
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,030
Projecting military strength
often isn't enough.

243
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,100
Many tend to conflate their
country's national identity

244
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,060
with their personal identity,
so they need to appear strong, too.

245
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,040
The most obvious example
of this is Vladimir Putin,

246
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,930
who's taken so many glamour shots,
there are calendars of him.

247
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,860
The latest ones feature him
cuddling leopards,

248
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,950
taking a shirtless ice bath
and sunbathing, which... cool.

249
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,960
But he's not alone. There's also
Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov's

250
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,000
ridiculous workout videos, which
I cannot recommend highly enough.

251
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,620
It's like watching
a Keebler elf get ripped.

252
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:29,490
My favorite example
of this is also the saddest.

253
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:32,530
Watch as the authoritarian
President of Turkmenistan

254
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,550
forces his cabinet to watch him
take a gold bar and do...

255
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,650
... whatever this is.

256
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,490
When you go to work tomorrow
and you're forced to laugh

257
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,510
at your supervisor's dumb jokes,
just spare a thought

258
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:04,620
for the people who had to give
a standing ovation to their boss

259
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,620
for lifting a golden curtain rod.

260
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,540
Authoritarians are obsessed
with projecting strength.

261
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,590
They often tell their citizens that
strength is necessary to protect them.

262
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,620
From what? That brings us
to their second major trait,

263
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,650
a tendency to demonize enemies.

264
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,430
Authoritarians often go out
of their way to identify

265
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,570
a group of evildoers from whom they,
and they alone, can save the country.

266
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:33,580
Duterte rose to power by claiming
he was the antidote to drug crime.

267
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,480
Since 2016, Human Rights Watch
estimates that his drug war

268
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,700
has killed more than 12000 people,
many of them extrajudicially.

269
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,690
That shouldn't be surprising,

270
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,460
given that this was an actual message
his campaign issued at Christmas.

271
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,670
I'm still only human so allow me
to make a greeting.

272
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,550
Merry Christmas
to you drug addicts,

273
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,580
thieves,
corrupt politicians and criminals

274
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,550
and all else who make life hard
for the Filipinos.

275
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:05,480
So, if you don't cease and
still continue your brutality,

276
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,680
this will be
your final Merry Christmas.

277
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:16,490
That is a hard turn
in a Christmas message.

278
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,560
It does remind me: with
Thanksgiving coming up this week,

279
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,690
I'd like to wish a Happy Thanksgiving
to everyone watching.

280
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,520
Especially if you're a turkey.
We're gonna slit your throat,

281
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,380
stuff your dumb bird corpse with
bread, chopped vegetables,

282
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,460
garlic and rosemary, and bake you
in an oven for four hours.

283
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,420
It's what you fucking deserve.

284
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,400
This will be your final
Happy Thanksgiving.

285
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:49,600
Sorry. Where was I?
Authoritarians need enemies

286
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:54,550
because one of their greatest appeals
is making a complicated world simple.

287
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,620
If you're under attack
or you've been made to feel that way,

288
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:02,400
it is nice to have an individual say:
"fuck rules, the system, I got this."

289
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,510
That's an impulse
we're all vulnerable to.

290
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:08,420
Take me: I believe in the separation
of powers and the rule of law.

291
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,560
If America were to descend into
a civil war, and someone said:

292
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,450
"What if we just let Tom Hanks
figure it out?"

293
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,620
A not insignificant part of me
would go: "Yeah. That seems nice."

294
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,400
In fact, all praise Daddy Hanks. Long
live the Gump. Death to his enemies.

295
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,440
When people are frightened, they can
be more susceptible to authoritarians.

296
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,640
That is why, if a real threat
doesn't present itself,

297
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,690
strongmen will sometimes
make one up,

298
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:37,640
often targeting a group persecuted,
like immigrants or minorities.

299
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,780
Viktor Orban's rightward turn
in Hungary has been accompanied

300
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,620
by stoking fear of Muslims
and refugees.

301
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,670
When Putin was facing a dip
in popularity a few years ago,

302
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,820
he went after gay people,

303
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,840
suggesting that homosexuality was
a weapon of the EU to weaken Russia.

304
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,760
Sounds ridiculous,
but judging by this man,

305
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,730
the message may have got across.

306
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,800
Russia is not Europe. We have our
own conservative traditional values.

307
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,730
In Europe
these boundaries are being crossed.

308
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,780
They're legalizing pedophilia,
zoophilia. They have zoo brothels.

309
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:13,640
Wait, do they?
Are you sure?

310
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:17,690
I'm pretty confident that there is
no such thing as a zoo brothel.

311
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,740
A zoo brothel is, if anything,
just a regular zoo

312
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,780
where you slip the zookeeper 20 bucks
to leave you alone in penguinarium.

313
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,750
Don't think about that if you don't
like it, just don't absorb it.

314
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,290
Just don't absorb
the idea in your mind.

315
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,300
You would hope that
an independent press,

316
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,210
or an opposition party, might
push back on that sort of bullshit,

317
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:44,190
which brings us to our final key
trait, dismantling institutions.

318
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,320
As they gain power, authoritarians
will try to weaken any check on them.

319
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,370
Journalists in authoritarian
regimes are threatened,

320
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,270
imprisoned, killed,
or, in Putin's Russia,

321
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,360
have tragic accident that hopefully
others may learn from

322
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,350
and authoritarians will also attack
foundational checks and balances,

323
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,300
like courts and legislatures.

324
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,340
The structures of government in
Turkey, China, Hungary and Venezuela

325
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,260
have all been modified to consolidate
power under their leaders.

326
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:15,220
As Poland becomes
increasingly authoritarian,

327
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,200
their de facto leader no longer has to
worry about the country's highest judge

328
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,190
because his party cleverly managed
to force them out

329
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,370
simply by lowering
their retirement age.

330
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,140
When some judges showed up
to work anyway in protest,

331
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,280
an official had
this patronizing response.

332
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,760
They can enter the building,
they can be there,

333
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,840
they can be there as guests,

334
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:42,800
but they cannot work as judges
because they are retired.

335
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,920
I really don't blame those judges
for being furious,

336
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,940
because there are only two
ways to really piss off a judge!

337
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,760
One: force them into retirement.
Or two: ask how many brews

338
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,810
they'd usually pound when
working out with PJ and Squee.

339
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,780
They don't like that at all.

340
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,900
Projecting strength, demonizing
enemies and dismantling institutions

341
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,780
are some key
things authoritarians do.

342
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,700
If you're wondering: "who would
ever want a leader who does that?"

343
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,810
The answer is: lots of people.
Many people support Duterte

344
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,770
not despite his authoritarian
tendencies, but because of them.

345
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,910
Filipinos have become too
disorderly and comfortable.

346
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,840
We need a president that can implement
measures and discipline us.

347
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:40,350
It's so obvious that the media
is biased, they only show the killings.

348
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,330
Why don't they show other stuff
he's doing,

349
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,410
like the infrastructure
he's building?

350
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:51,330
Wait! What? It is incredible
to hear someone claim,

351
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,430
brushing off killings and complaining
that more attention

352
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,440
should be paid to infrastructure.

353
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,370
She must be the only person
who could hear a story

354
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:02,310
about a death squad
throwing someone off a bridge

355
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,500
and say: "Wait, tell me
more about that bridge."

356
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,390
"Sturdy enough
for a whole squad? Very impressive!"

357
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,410
As we have gone through these traits,
you may have found yourself thinking:

358
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,400
"Some of these are ringing a bell."

359
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:21,380
We do now have to bring the story
back around to this guy.

360
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,410
Our president. Because he
exhibits many of the things

361
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,380
that you've seen so far tonight.

362
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,490
He loves appearing strong.
He wanted a military parade.

363
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:33,350
When it comes to demonizing
enemies, he's gleefully gone

364
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,850
after immigrants
and other marginalized groups,

365
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,760
as well as picking aggressively
optional battles with Canada,

366
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,800
the NFL, Mark Cuban,
the FBI, Robert De Niro,

367
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,680
the 2017 Emmy Awards, Puerto Rico,
the Postal Service,

368
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,770
an upscale farm-to-table
restaurant in Virginia, the NSA,

369
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,760
LaVar Ball, the city of Chicago,
Mayor of London, the CEO of Merck,

370
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,850
Nordstrom
and Chrissy fucking Teigen.

371
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,710
And that is only counting
the Twitter feuds.

372
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,820
Trump has expressed admiration for
many of the authoritarians you've seen,

373
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,780
including praising Duterte for
the "unbelievable job" he was doing

374
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,850
cleaning up crime
in the Philippines.

375
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,790
Trump retweeted a parody account
that attributed to him the quote:

376
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,780
"It is better to live one day as a lion
than 100 years as a sheep",

377
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,800
which isn't something that Trump
said, it's a slogan Mussolini used.

378
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,640
That's right, it was
synonymous with pasta Hitler.

379
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:30,630
When that was pointed out
to Trump, this was his response.

380
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,730
- Did you know it was Mussolini?
- It's okay to know.

381
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,230
Mussolini was Mussolini.
It's a very good quote.

382
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:43,100
It's a very interesting quote.
I know who said it.

383
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:48,160
What difference does it make whether
it's Mussolini or somebody else?

384
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,290
You want to be
associated with a fascist?

385
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,110
No,
with interesting quotes.

386
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:04,200
Okay. So, first, let's agree:
there is a roughly 50 percent chance

387
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:08,060
that Trump thinks that Mussolini
is just an Italian moose.

388
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,220
It's a coin flip. And second:

389
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,200
if being associated with
"interesting quotes" is the goal,

390
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:19,070
there are better ones, attributed to
people who committed fewer crimes.

391
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,140
How about this one:

392
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,060
"Another thing I like to do is give
my vagina a little vitamin D."

393
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,280
Trump didn't say that,
Shailene Woodley did,

394
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,260
but it's an interesting quote and
one we should associate Trump with.

395
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:35,210
That was from before
he was elected president.

396
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:39,740
His entire tone on the campaign trail
was of an unapologetic strongman.

397
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:43,680
I'm gonna bomb
the shit out of them. It's true.

398
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,690
I don't care.

399
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,820
I'd like to punch him in the face.

400
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:54,740
We're keeping that open and we're
gonna load it up with bad dudes.

401
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,860
Torture works, folks.

402
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,840
I have these guys: "torture doesn't
work." Believe me it works, ok.

403
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,800
So "bomb, punch,
imprison, torture."

404
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:08,800
We just need to see Trump lift a gold
bar and do a topless calendar shoot

405
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,730
and we've basically got
authoritarian bingo.

406
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:17,730
People liked that. It may be the thing
about Trump they liked the most.

407
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:21,660
Watch how he described
how Putin deals with journalists.

408
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:24,700
And then they said:
"he's killed reporters."

409
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,850
I don't like that.
I'm totally against it.

410
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,770
By the way, I hate some of these
people, but I'd never kill them.

411
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:34,840
I hate them. No, I think, no,
I'll be honest...

412
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:40,850
I would never kill them.
I would never do that.

413
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,750
Let's think!
No, I wouldn't.

414
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,660
I would never kill them.
But I do hate 'em.

415
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,890
Some of them are such lying,
disgusting people. It's true.

416
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:01,810
That is legitimately scary.
I know that Trump is kidding,

417
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,830
but I'm not sure that everyone
in that audience is

418
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,860
and they are flirting with
something very dangerous.

419
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,680
Trump will do anything if it gets
a big enough cheer.

420
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,900
The difference between him joking
about something and doing it,

421
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:18,710
is only about 30 decibels
on the applause-o-meter.

422
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:23,860
The real worry here isn't just
that Trump sounds like an authoritarian

423
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:27,740
it's that many people
like the way that sounds.

424
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:30,890
We need somebody tough.
Trump shows toughness.

425
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,820
We got somebody with balls.

426
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,890
He's a man that says what he says
and he doesn't back down.

427
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:40,640
I'll feel safer in our
country with him as a president.

428
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,640
If Jesus Christ gets down off the cross
and told me Trump is with Russia,

429
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,780
I would tell him, hold on, I need
to check with the president.

430
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,620
I don't know what's more depressing:

431
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,680
the thought of that man believing
Trump over Jesus

432
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,710
or the thought
of Jesus coming back

433
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:00,700
as someone who won't shut up
about Trump and Russia.

434
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,730
We get it. We all agree with
you, but you know, we get it.

435
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,670
No, I didn't see Maddow, Jesus.
Was she on fire?

436
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:15,610
It's pretty clear that Trump
shares many characteristics

437
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,800
with authoritarian leaders.

438
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,770
We're not currently
an authoritarian state.

439
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:24,600
So why is that? While Trump
has done terrible things as president,

440
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:27,660
our institutions,
generally speaking, so far,

441
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:32,780
have been strong enough to hold up
against his authoritarian instincts.

442
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,650
He's not managed to shut
down the Mueller investigation, yet.

443
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,780
He wants to end birthright citizenship,
but that's not what a president can do.

444
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,540
His efforts to ban a CNN reporter
from the White House were halted

445
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,600
by a judge that he himself had
appointed and that's good,

446
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,540
but there's no doubt
Trump is testing the system.

447
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,500
Appointing this well dressed
fire hydrant as his attorney general

448
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,590
is a worrying sign.

449
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,570
As are his attempts
to delegitimize elections

450
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,520
by declaring results
he doesn't like fraudulent.

451
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:04,380
So people do need
to remain vigilant.

452
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,580
That is the key thing here:

453
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,400
while we may talk about
"institutions being strong",

454
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:13,480
what that means is that people
are working hard to protect them

455
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,610
and to use them to contain
his president's worst impulses.

456
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,610
He's lost in court,
because people have sued him.

457
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,490
He's kept the Russia
investigation going,

458
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:26,400
his advisors know there would be
a public outcry if he stopped it.

459
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,540
Congress
is able to check him going forward,

460
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,420
because people
turned up at the midterms.

461
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:36,530
It is going to be even more
important to keep doing those things.

462
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:40,450
The world is dabbling with
something very dangerous.

463
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,440
America needs to be careful.

464
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:46,790
I know democracy can be,
often by design, frustrating.

465
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,750
Checks and balances
can be irritating and slow

466
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,670
and might not deliver
the outcome you wanted.

467
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,680
But removing them opens
the door to something worse.

468
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,620
That is true whether you live
in Russia, Turkey, Hungary,

469
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:03,710
the Philippines, Brazil,
or, yes, the United States.

470
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,730
I know that America is a different
country, with a different history

471
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,670
and, thankfully, more
resilient institutions.

472
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,740
But that is no cause for complacency
because the truth is,

473
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:17,620
the honest answer to "could
authoritarianism happen here?"

474
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,840
is, and possibly always will be:
No, I think, no...

475
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:28,620
Probably no. And now this.

476
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:34,860
Sportscasters Who Are Too Enthusiastic
About Sports They're Casting.

477
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:39,670
You know what?
No. Not "And Now" That.

478
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:42,730
Every week I read
these stupid title cards,

479
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,150
but I'm capable
of so much more.

480
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,300
I studied Shakespeare.
I do impressions.

481
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:54,200
Are you talkin' to me?
(That's De Niro).

482
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,080
Not bad, right?

483
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:00,070
That's all you get.
I'm out of here.

484
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:05,110
The Cold,
Inky Blackness Of Space.

485
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:10,220
How do you like that, assholes?

486
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:17,270
Moving on. So as this is
our final episode of the year,

487
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,070
we wanted to thank you
for watching.

488
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:22,270
We had a lot of fun, despite,
you know, the world.

489
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:28,170
We started a crisis pregnancy center,
had Wilmer Valderrama in a bird suit,

490
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,070
we wrote a book
about Mike Pence's rabbit,

491
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,150
and you bought it a lot,
raising a huge amount of money

492
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:38,210
for The Trevor Project
and AIDS United...

493
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:41,190
We did an episode
on Xi Jinping

494
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,230
that got HBO's website
temporarily blocked in China.

495
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:48,910
We talked to Anita Hill about her
experiences in a prescient interview

496
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,750
and we put Gritty
on our dog Supreme Court.

497
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:56,920
A quick update about my personal
favorite moment from this year.

498
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,930
We like to buy stupid things.
For instance, last year,

499
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,980
we bought five wax presidents: Carter,
Nixon, Harding, Clinton and Harrison

500
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,770
and we made a movie about the life
of Warren G. Harding with Laura Linney.

501
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:15,900
We promised you we would try and
use the rest of the presidents,

502
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,830
but we never
got around to it.

503
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,810
This year, we bought
something even dumber.

504
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,830
When Russell Crowe
held his divorce auction,

505
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,880
we bought a bunch of his memorabilia,

506
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:29,770
including his jockstrap from
the 2005 film "Cinderella Man",

507
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:32,950
which we then donated to one
of the last Blockbusters in Alaska.

508
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:36,920
And to his immense credit,
Russell Crowe used the money

509
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:41,950
to fund the John Oliver Koala
Chlamydia Ward at the Australia Zoo.

510
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,770
That is a burn so harsh

511
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,100
that only koalas with chlamydia
can sympathize.

512
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:53,050
It was a truly life-affirming sequence
of events,

513
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,030
although I'm sorry to say that
I do have a sad update

514
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,970
on the "Alaskan Blockbuster"
part of that story.

515
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,940
Alaska's last Blockbuster Video
stores are calling it quits.

516
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:06,980
John Oliver tried to draw attention
to these stores, to save them.

517
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,900
He gave them a leather jockstrap
that Russell Crowe wore.

518
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,000
- That would call attention to...
- Incredibly, that did not help.

519
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,080
First, fuck you, just a little bit.

520
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,010
It is sad. I didn't expect
the jockstrap to save Blockbuster.

521
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,870
As amazing as Russell Crowe's
leather scrotum holster is,

522
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,940
I didn't think it had the power
to make Netflix disappear.

523
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,980
If you wonder what happened
to Crowe's merchandise,

524
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,950
I have good news
and bad news.

525
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,920
The good news is, there's one
remaining Blockbuster in America.

526
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,930
It's in Oregon, and all the items
were sent there.

527
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,220
The bad news is
one of them went missing.

528
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:53,290
And tragically,
it was the jockstrap.

529
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:57,370
There were actually numerous
stories about its disappearance.

530
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:02,360
I am sorry to tell you that we have
no idea where Crowe's jockstrap is.

531
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:08,220
We simply don't. Except for
the fact that we actually do.

532
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:14,270
Not only do we know where that
jockstrap is, we asked ourselves:

533
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:18,170
"what would be the single
dumbest possible way to pay tribute"

534
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,340
"to the most stupid
thing happened this year?"

535
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,170
And the answer, we hope
you will agree, was this.

536
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:31,220
All right, listen up.
We've robbed banks, museums,

537
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:35,290
casinos, but this,
this is the big one.

538
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:41,250
The greatest heist of all time.
We're gonna steal

539
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:47,320
Russell Crowe's jockstrap from
the 2005 film "Cinderella Man".

540
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,100
The Wax and The Furious

541
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,090
This won't be easy. That's why
I've hired the best of the best:

542
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,860
Tricky Dick, the best damn
explosives man in New York City,

543
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,010
Jimmy C-Note, Mr. Fix-It himself,
there's no ride he can't chop,

544
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:37,990
Willy Pneumonia,
a sick man with a sick rap sheet.

545
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,930
Billy Wheels,
the man with the master...

546
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,910
I'm not really sure what he does.

547
00:34:54,860 --> 00:35:00,000
And of course our ringleader,
the OG himself, G-Dawg.

548
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,100
Like I said, this won't be easy.

549
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,890
This could get messy.

550
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,930
They're gonna throw everything
they got at us.

551
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,050
You ready to do this?

552
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,860
Buckle up, motherfuckers.

553
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,010
These guys are everywhere!
Cover me!

554
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,680
Where did that come from?

555
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,580
That's how it's done!

556
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,600
Warning, security breach.

557
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,460
You think this is over?

558
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,630
We have the strap.

559
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,560
Don't you let that jockstrap
get away, G-Dawg.

560
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,560
Stay on him!

561
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,600
Who the hell
do these guys work for?

562
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,550
Hello, my pretty.
I've missed you.

563
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,600
Welcome home.

564
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,580
That's our show.

565
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,670
Our thanks to Armie Hammer,
Russell Crowe and the boyz.

566
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:55,350
Thanks for watching this year.
We'll be back in February. Good night!

567
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:58,310
Are you not entertained?

568
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,450
My pretty.

569
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,500
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

570
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,510
END OF EPISODE 30,
SEASON V
