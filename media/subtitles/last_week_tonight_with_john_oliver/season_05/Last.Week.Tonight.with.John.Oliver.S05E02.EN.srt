00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,110
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,150
SEASON V
EPISODE 2

3
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,020
Welcome to Last Week Tonight!

4
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,030
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us!

5
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,100
Before we start this evening,
a quick update regarding this show.

6
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,060
You may remember that last year,
we did an episode on coal.

7
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,120
In which we talked about this man,
Bob Murray.

8
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,100
We said a lot of things about him,

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,030
culminating in a seven-foot
squirrel telling him to eat shit.

10
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,130
And he sued us for defamation.
It's true.

11
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,210
That case has been going on
ever since,

12
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,050
but we learned that the judge
has said he's going to dismiss it.

13
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,990
Now. It's not final yet.

14
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,900
I've been advised not to say
much more for now. So I won't.

15
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,980
Because as I think we know now,
now is not the time for victory laps.

16
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,960
It's not a time for gloating.
It's not a time for saying, "We won".

17
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:28,070
Rubbing it in the face of the person
who lost, over and over again.

18
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,940
That time will come.
It will come and I promise

19
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,050
that we will discuss this whole case
as soon as we are able to.

20
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:40,050
Until then, my furry friend, away!
Away!

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,870
He'll be back
I promise he will be back.

22
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,840
So for now tonight, let's move on
to a quick recap of the week,

23
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,840
which was dominated
by the debate over gun control,

24
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,970
in the wake
of last week's school shooting.

25
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,900
But the president has said

26
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,020
that he is determined to stop this
from ever happening again,

27
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,880
and he even gave us a glimpse
of his new plan.

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,050
While Trump says he's listening
to new ideas about school safety,

29
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,210
he emphasized arming teachers
and other school personnel,

30
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,010
an idea backed
by the National Rifle Association.

31
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,130
We need to let people know:
you come into our schools,

32
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,060
you're gonna be dead
and it's going to be fast.

33
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,080
Okay, so first thing there:

34
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,200
"You're going to be dead
and it's going to be fast"

35
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,020
is already the slogan for Carl's Jr.,
so you can't use that.

36
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,060
Trump's support for this terrible idea
seemed to develop over the week.

37
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:41,010
He focus-grouped it during a session
featuring survivors of the shooting

38
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,150
a session for which his own notes
included a reminder to say,

39
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,180
"I hear you",
which is what you might write down

40
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,080
if you were a robot
pretending to be a person

41
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,060
pretending to be a robot
pretending to be a person.

42
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,080
Not surprisingly, arming some teachers
did not go down too well in that room.

43
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,060
Watch what happened
when he asked for a show of hands.

44
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,230
Does anybody like that idea?
Here? Does anybody like it?

45
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,970
Right? Yes?
For Meadow, your beautiful Meadow.

46
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,030
We talked about that.

47
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,060
And do people
feel strongly against it?

48
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,000
Anybody? Strongly against it?

49
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,130
All right.
We can understand both sides.

50
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,080
That is Donald Trump
in a nutshell:

51
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,040
proposing a terrible idea
in a tone-deaf way,

52
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,150
then refusing to acknowledge
he just lost a popular vote.

53
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,110
There are clearly multiple issues
with the idea of arming teachers

54
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,140
from the fact
that it is not their job,

55
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,140
to the fact that there was
an armed deputy in Parkland

56
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,990
and that didn't deter
or stop the shooter

57
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,050
but even the logistics
of this plan are pretty daunting.

58
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,970
There are over three million
public school teachers nationwide

59
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,160
and four hundred thousand
in private schools.

60
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,050
Arming twenty percent of them
as Mr. Trump suggested Thursday,

61
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,160
would mean more than 700000
people with guns in schools.

62
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,010
Yeah, so it's no wonder
the NRA likes this solution.

63
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,990
It involves buying
hundreds of thousands of guns.

64
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,300
And that's their solution
to everything.

65
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,290
They'd deal with climate change
by pointing a Glock at the ocean

66
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,360
and daring that motherfucker
to rise.

67
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,440
And it's worth noting
that one of the many key groups

68
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,410
expressing doubts
about this idea is teachers.

69
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,400
This does not pass
any common sense test whatsoever.

70
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,320
National Education Association said
more guns in school is not a solution.

71
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,350
The problem
is that very dangerous people

72
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,380
have very easy access
to very dangerous weapons.

73
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:44,200
She's right, and she's using
the patient, exasperated tone

74
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,220
of a teacher explaining something
to the dumbest student in her class

75
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,320
which, in a way, she is.

76
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,310
"Donald, your answer
doesn't make sense."

77
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,200
"Also, we don't actually want
'less' guns in schools."

78
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,370
"We want 'fewer' guns
in schools."

79
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,270
"Donald. Donald. Focus Donald.
1-2-3, all eyes on me."

80
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,350
Let's move on to India.
An economic and cultural powerhouse,

81
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,350
the reason that your annoying friend
won't shut up about Bikram yoga.

82
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,310
"We get it Paisley.
You can fuck upside down now."

83
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,370
India hosted
a number of foreign dignitaries.

84
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,240
Canadian Prime Minister
Justin Trudeau,

85
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,270
whose visit
got off to a rocky start.

86
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,380
Prime Minister Modi's
glaring silence

87
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,220
on the visit of Justin Trudeau
hasn't gone unnoticed.

88
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,410
No welcome tweet, no airport hug,
and no joint visit to Gujurat.

89
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,210
Is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
getting the Modi snub?

90
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,340
It seems like
Modi's treating Trudeau

91
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,340
like a guy who finishes
third on "The Bachelorette",

92
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,270
which is actually
what Justin Trudeau looks like.

93
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:55,430
He'd get to hometowns, sure.
But after fantasy suite it's done-zo.

94
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,250
That snub may have its roots

95
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,280
in Trudeau's perceived soft approach
to Sikh extremist groups in Canada.

96
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,200
He didn't help the situation

97
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,230
by going in heavy
on the national-dress pandering,

98
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,340
with Indian outfit after Indian outfit
that seemed a bit much.

99
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,520
It's not like,
when Modi visits Ottowa,

100
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,400
he turns up
in full Canadian formal dress,

101
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,440
by which I mean
a gravy-stained Toronto Raptors jersey

102
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,360
and Roots sweatpants.

103
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,320
And it's not just me
who found it over the top.

104
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,390
Listen to this
Indian fashion designer.

105
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,430
I just thought it was a little
too Indian for Indians also,

106
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:35,510
a little tacky when it came
to the sartorial choices.

107
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,420
I'm glad it's a Canadian designer
and it's not an Indian designer

108
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,530
who's just made
this fashion blunder.

109
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,400
He looked like a backup dancer
for a cheap Bollywood movie.

110
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,450
"A cheap Bollywood movie."

111
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,360
That is a solid zing
from Indian Tim Gunn.

112
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:56,350
Trudeau's visit turned
out to be the most unwatchable

113
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,550
white person's trip through India
since "The Darjeeling Limited".

114
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,550
But Trudeau was actually lucky,

115
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,490
because his trip was overshadowed
by a visit from Donald Trump Jr.,

116
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:09,500
named man of the year by "Daddy
Issues" magazine 40 years running.

117
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:14,140
What brought America's
greatest-living Donald Trump to India?

118
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,170
Was it a profound sense
of wanderlust?

119
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,210
Or did, perhaps, a trash pile
of shitty condos need unloading?

120
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,190
I won't keep you in suspense!

121
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,060
Donald Trump, Jr. Arriving today,

122
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,060
using the Trump brand
to sell new luxury apartments.

123
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,280
Newspaper ads in the country touting,
'Trump has arrived. Have you?'

124
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,190
"Trump has arrived" is unquestionably
what Don Jr. says when he orgasms.

125
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,130
He saves the "have you?"
for special occasions.

126
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,130
And also,
that is a pretty misleading ad.

127
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:53,200
People assume you mean the President
of the United States, not Don, Jr.

128
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,210
It's like if Ed Sullivan went,
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Beatles!"

129
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,190
And then the studio
was just overrun with beetles.

130
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,240
That's not
what people signed up for.

131
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,270
Even those present
were disappointed,

132
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,200
with one real-estate developer
telling "The Washington Post",

133
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,280
"ideally we'd have
preferred Ivanka."

134
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,120
Which yes, is understandable.

135
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,140
But you're coming off
a little ungrateful, India.

136
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,000
Just be thankful you didn't get Eric.
Ok? It could have been worse.

137
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,180
Don, Jr.'s trip started off
a little bumpy as well.

138
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,070
He sat down with CNBC India,
for a softball interview

139
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,110
in which he somehow managed to give
the only wrong answer to the question,

140
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,000
"Can you say one thing
you like about India?"

141
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,140
There is something about the spirit

142
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,240
of the Indian people that's unique here
to other parts of the emerging world.

143
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,190
You go through a town...
I don't mean to be glib about it,

144
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,010
but you can see
the poorest of the poor,

145
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,010
and there's still
a smile on a face.

146
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,110
It's a different spirit that you
don't see in other parts of the world.

147
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,020
Condescending tone aside,

148
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,030
even if "the poorest of the poor"
were smiling at Don, Jr.,

149
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:10,030
no way that they weren't thinking,
"we would have preferred Ivanka".

150
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,140
The problem with this trip was
the ethical questions that it posed,

151
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,730
in part because those
who bought in to the condos

152
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,720
got offered
"conversation and dinner" with Don, Jr.

153
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,770
Is fine for a private citizen,
but it becomes problematic

154
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,770
if he's perceived
as representing the government.

155
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,690
And while he insisted that he was
just a private businessman,

156
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,720
one speech was originally titled,

157
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,700
"Reshaping Indo-Pacific Ties:
The New Era Of Cooperation",

158
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,640
which sure as shit sounds
like foreign policy.

159
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,690
They must have realized the problem,

160
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:45,780
because the title was later changed to
"Fireside Chat with Donald Trump Jr.,

161
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,560
"Executive Vice President,
the Trump Organization."

162
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,650
In between, it was billed as "Big Boy
Business With I'm Donald Trump Too."

163
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,800
Still, I will say
this in Donald Jr.'s defense:

164
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,780
it may be difficult for him to sell
access to his father's inner circle.

165
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,660
As he revealed during the fireside chat
he doesn't seem to be anywhere near it.

166
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,790
What are conversations at home like?

167
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,650
I see him so little
that we don't talk politics.

168
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,780
When I think,
'Why don't I call him just to say hi,'

169
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,580
I think about the stuff that
he's dealing with on a daily basis.

170
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,540
When something goes on,
in a country far, far away,

171
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,560
and I'm
man I don't want to bother him.

172
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,590
I feel it's almost trite to call him
and just to say hello.

173
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,640
Does that make any sense?
It probably doesn't.

174
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,660
No you're right.
It doesn't. At all.

175
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,510
Because calling your dad just to
say hello could never seem trite.

176
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:41,670
Because that's not what the word
"trite" means in any shape or form.

177
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:47,450
He can call his dad, or not call him,
it doesn't really make a difference.

178
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,640
If we've learned one thing
about Donald Trump,

179
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,550
is that you can be sitting
right in front of him,

180
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,640
and he can even tell you
that he hears you,

181
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,640
but that does not mean he's listening
to a fucking word you're saying.

182
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,470
And now this!

183
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:04,440
And now:
the quiet pain of Rachael Ray.

184
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,470
My first memory
is of grilling

185
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,670
my own thumb to my mom's griddle
in the restaurant.

186
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,650
Not a pleasant memory
but my first.

187
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,570
Good thing
I can't feel my fingers.

188
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,550
I can't feel most of my digits.

189
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,080
I can't feel any of my fingers
since the late '80s.

190
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,930
I can't feel my fingers.
I can't feel most of my fingers.

191
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,880
I can't feel my fingers.
This finger is so dead

192
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,950
at parties I bet people how long
I can leave it in a flame.

193
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,920
No sensation left really.

194
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,030
A little bit of salt in the sauce
and over the shoulder for luck.

195
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:55,060
Moving on. Our main story tonight,
our main story tonight concerns Italy.

196
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,120
The country that gave us spaghetti,
the Colosseum,

197
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,940
and the guy who played Turtle.

198
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,900
So it's a rich tapestry.

199
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,110
Italy is holding an election

200
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,120
to select a new parliament,
and a new prime minister.

201
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:13,000
You're thinking: "I don't know who
Italy's 'current' prime minister is."

202
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,890
"I assumed it was
just a Vespa in a tank top."

203
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:20,110
Don't be too hard on yourself.
There has been a lot of them.

204
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,820
This will be Italy's 65th government
in just over 70 years.

205
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,830
So it's probably hard for Italians
to remember who their leader is.

206
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,820
For the record, it's this man. Also,
for the record, it's "not" that man.

207
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,900
I typed "Italian man" into a stock
image site and here's what came up.

208
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,950
But this election is coming
at a pivotal time for Italy,

209
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,010
and the run-up to it
has been toxic.

210
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,850
Italy is seeing
a rise in political violence

211
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,990
ahead of its elections
on March 4th.

212
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,900
Riot equipped police fired water canons
and tear gas as they clashed

213
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,820
with far left protesters marching
against a nearby neofascist rally.

214
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,880
Over the past month there have been

215
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,860
political motivated stabbings
and beatings in some Italian cities.

216
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,920
Italy is in turmoil
and is dabbling with fascism.

217
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,950
And that should worry everyone,

218
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,000
because the last time they did that,
they wound up with Mussolini,

219
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,010
the, to put it nicely,
Turner to Hitler's "Hooch".

220
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,030
Sadly, the conditions
are ripe for fascism to flourish there.

221
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,830
Italy is Europe's
third-largest economy,

222
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:29,790
yet its public debt
is 130% of GDP

223
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,960
for context,
that's second only to Greece.

224
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,810
The bank of Greece is currently
a goat dancing around an open fire.

225
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,960
Unemployment is high. Politicians have
been stoking antiimmigrant sentiments.

226
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,770
Over 600000 migrants have landed
on Italian shores in the last 4 years.

227
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,880
And on top of all of this,

228
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,880
Italy is facing the same problem
that has plagued American elections.

229
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:56,740
Patrizio Nissirio is a senior editor
at Ansa, Italy's leading news agency.

230
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,720
He says fake news
is exploding across Europe.

231
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,720
It's such a danger
that figures like Pope Francis

232
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,960
warned the press not to spread,
what he made a very strong parallel

233
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,940
between feces
and this kind of news.

234
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,930
That's true!
The Pope reportedly said

235
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,750
fake news is like getting
sexually aroused by feces.

236
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,760
It truly is a magical time
to be alive.

237
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,110
So it seems yet again,

238
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,010
a large European country
is teetering on the edge of chaos.

239
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,960
It is worth looking
at the Italian election,

240
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,920
because everything
about it is fascinating.

241
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,920
And let's begin with the key figures.
Former Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi.

242
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,950
He is a centrist,
and he had to resign

243
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,100
after making a bold attempt
to reform Italy's political system.

244
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,930
A referendum
that did not go well for him.

245
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,090
I lost
and I say it loud and clear,

246
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,880
even if I have a lump in my throat,
I wasn't able to win.

247
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,920
Long live Italy
and good luck to all of us.

248
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,900
This is ominous.

249
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,940
That's like a pilot
coming on over the loudspeaker:

250
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,960
"Looks like ol' Captain Doug
came up short this time."

251
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,910
"Anyway, sit back, relax,
and good luck to all of us."

252
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,910
I would say that that
was Renzi's most humiliating defeat,

253
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,970
but that honor has to go to
his appearance in the nineties

254
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,450
on Italy's "Wheel of Fortune".

255
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,270
- I'd like to give the answer.
- I'd like to see that. Antarctica.

256
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,460
Mountains of ice
and a sea of ships.

257
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,250
Of ships?!

258
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,290
A sea of ships?
What does that have to do with it?

259
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,300
Certainly ships
do go to Antarctica.

260
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,390
It is not good when
the host is joining in:

261
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,270
"I know my only job on this show
is to move things along,"

262
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,250
"but the people have spoken!"

263
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,430
Boo! Boo to you.

264
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:07,460
Renzi wants a comeback,
but he'll face an uphill battle,

265
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,360
Italy's experiencing a wave
of antiestablishment sentiment.

266
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,400
Understandable. The country
has problems with corruption

267
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:18,240
and their government
is gridlocked.

268
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,470
One of the most interesting parties
attempting to harness this anger

269
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,300
is called Five Star.

270
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,290
It started eight years ago
in a very unusual way.

271
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,480
He comes onto stage
like a rockstar. Beppe Grillo,

272
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,220
comedian turned fire-breathing curse
flinging critic of the status quo.

273
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,210
Grillo founded his so called
Five Star Movement

274
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,430
first railing on his blog, and
recently in piazzas across the country,

275
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,330
against sky-high taxes,
Italy's legendary red tape,

276
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:54,270
corrupt politicians, greedy
businessmen and lazy bureaucrats.

277
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:58,410
Five Star was started by a comedian,
who organized demonstrations

278
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,310
called "Vaffanculo Day," which
translates to "fuck off day".

279
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:10,210
A great idea for a holiday.
Hallmark should take that concept

280
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,220
'cause I think of a lot of people
I would like to send a card to.

281
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,260
Grillo has since stepped away
from the party

282
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,310
and Five Star's candidate
is 31-year-old Luigi Di Maio.

283
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:28,230
31 is a little young to be the leader
of a major European nation.

284
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,390
Di Maio is one year
"younger" than Frankie Muniz

285
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,190
and I do not want him
running Italy.

286
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,200
I don't even want him running
his own Twitter account

287
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,030
'cause two days ago,
he tweeted "I have a toothache."

288
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:46,100
C'mon, Frankie!
Sell your brand! Do better, boy!

289
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:52,070
When you see Di Maio in action,
he lives up to your worst assumptions

290
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,190
of what a 31-year-old candidate
for prime minister could be.

291
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,190
This country is weighed down,

292
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,980
parties are a weight
with their conflicts of interest.

293
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,980
We have to fly high, bring this
country and make it fly high.

294
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,080
This is why today
we will actually fly!

295
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:27,000
Cool. Although, to be honest
that's not "really" flying, is it?

296
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,180
He should have said:

297
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,000
"The country is weighed down
with conflicts of interest,"

298
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,000
"so we have to make Italy
hover 20 feet off the ground"

299
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,270
"while spinning in circles
and gripping an attendant's hand."

300
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,220
While there is a lot to like
about some of Five Star's policies,

301
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,310
there is also a lot
to be concerned about.

302
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,150
While they are "against"
a lot of things,

303
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,250
it is much less clear
what they're "for".

304
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:54,310
They've taking a hard-line
stance regarding immigration

305
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:58,190
with Di Maio criticizing
rescue efforts in the Mediterranean

306
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,290
as "sea-taxi services"
that must end.

307
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,140
Some party members
have engaged in vaccine skepticism

308
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,220
and Di Maio proposed rolling back
mandatory vaccinations for children.

309
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:13,270
Dangerous, considering Italy
saw nearly 5000 cases of measles,

310
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,350
including four deaths last year.

311
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,170
That should not be happening
in this day and age.

312
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,160
It's like hearing four people were
trampled to death

313
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,360
in line at a Blockbuster video.

314
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,210
How did that happen?

315
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,320
We're supposed to have
collectively moved past that by now!

316
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:36,190
There is the League, a far-right
party led by Matteo Salvini,

317
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:40,590
who, like Renzi, also appeared
on an Italian game show,

318
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,530
not just as a 12-year-old child,
but also later again when he was 20,

319
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:49,620
answering trivia questions
and racing with boxes on his feet.

320
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,450
I hope you enjoyed those clips,
that is as likable as Salvini gets.

321
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,580
He has grown up into a truly
poisonous politician.

322
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,620
He compared the female speaker
of the house to an inflatable sex doll.

323
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,470
He's taken a hard line on immigration,
saying out of control immigration leads

324
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,590
to drug dealing, rape,
theft and violence,

325
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,550
and he has trafficked
in some alarming rhetoric.

326
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:16,550
There's a need for
a mass cleaning, even in Italy.

327
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,500
From one street to the next,
from one neighborhood to the next,

328
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,430
town square to town square,
with strong methods, if necessary.

329
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,570
A mass cleaning
with strong methods!

330
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,480
He sounds like a fascist
Mary Poppins.

331
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,430
So basically: Mary Poppins.

332
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:40,570
The frightening thing is not all
voters are concerned by Salvini.

333
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,300
One told the New York Times:
"I like him, he puts Italians first."

334
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,320
"And I guess he's a fascist, too.
What can you do?"

335
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,090
To which the obvious answer is:
"Don't vote for him!",

336
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,090
that's literally
the "only" thing you should do.

337
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:59,220
If you think: "I think I know someone
who might hit it off with this guy",

338
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:04,130
don't worry,
of course they've met.

339
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,260
You thought maybe Trump
would not pop up in this story?

340
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,190
Think again. He is truly
the Forrest Gump of human misery.

341
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,090
This is true.

342
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,130
Salvini met with Trump
during the 2016 campaign

343
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:25,080
and Trump told Salvini he hoped
he would become prime minister soon.

344
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:31,110
I hope that does not happen, Salvini's
tone attracted nasty followers.

345
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,110
Look at what happened
this month.

346
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,110
The far-right supporter
in Italy is accused

347
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:40,140
of opening fire on African migrants
and wounding six of them.

348
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,160
He drove in front of a war monument
and made a fascist salute

349
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,530
wearing what looked
like an Italian flag.

350
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,490
That man reportedly
called Salvini his "captain"

351
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:54,490
and was one of the League's candidates
for a local election last year.

352
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,440
Which is awful.
Although it should be noted that,

353
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,520
in that election,
he received no votes.

354
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:03,460
Not only did his family
and friends not vote for him,

355
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,400
he didn't even vote for himself!

356
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,590
Even if you are a racist,
murderous piece of shit,

357
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:14,580
if you run for anything,
you should at least get "one" vote

358
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,550
or you're just a fucking idiot.

359
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:21,490
In the midst of economic uncertainty,
fake news and race-baiting,

360
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,420
what Italy needs is someone to step up
and lead them out of trouble.

361
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,450
A bold new voice.
A fresh leader of tomorrow.

362
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,490
Show us, Italy, who shall
be your knight in shining armor?

363
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,620
Forza Italia! Forza liberta!

364
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,590
Many thought he was
politically finished. Done.

365
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:47,430
But Silvio Berlusconi,
Italy's four-time prime minister,

366
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,670
is making a comeback.

367
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:54,690
It's true, he's back! Berlusconi...
Sorry, that's HPV.

368
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:59,720
Berlusconi... That's a condom
filled with marinara sauce.

369
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:07,650
Berlusconi has returned and recent
polls had his coalition in the lead.

370
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,610
So if Italy is considering
taking Berlusconi back,

371
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,720
it is worth the rest of us
brushing up on him.

372
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,640
He is one of history's most
ludicrous humans.

373
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,690
His ego is legendary.
He once claimed:

374
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,740
"my greatness is without question."

375
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,700
"My human substance, my history,
other people dream to have."

376
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:30,730
Berlusconi built a quasi cult
of personality around himself,

377
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,670
perhaps best exemplified
by this campaign song from 2008.

378
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,620
There's a big dream
that lives in us all.

379
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:43,620
We are the people of freedom.

380
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,630
President, we are with you.

381
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:50,640
Thank God Silvio exists!

382
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:55,650
That has to literally be
Silvio Berlusconi's fantasy:

383
00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:01,570
a world where he's the only man left
and every woman sings about him.

384
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,540
What people know about Berlusconi
can be summed up in two words:

385
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,520
the word "bunga", twice.

386
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:13,550
He hosted sex parties which
featured scores of orgies

387
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:17,720
and "female guests dressed up as
nuns, nurses and even Barack Obama."

388
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,550
Both deeply weird and
somehow deeply progressive.

389
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:26,630
Berlusconi likes to explore mixed race,
quasihomosexual experience.

390
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:32,540
Good on you, pig monster!
He owns a stake in TV channels,

391
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:36,660
some of which have broadcast shows
criticized for their coarse content,

392
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,630
including literally treating
women like pieces of meat.

393
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,590
He also owned a football
team called AC Milan,

394
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,730
but couldn't even talk to their
players without getting weird.

395
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,450
When are you going to
introduce me to your wife?

396
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:54,470
Just to see her. I'm old.
I can't do it anymore,

397
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,470
but because everyone says
she is the prettiest one.

398
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,370
What a terrific boss!
Hello, there employee!

399
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,400
Where's your spouse
I'd like to fuck?

400
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:07,370
Don't worry, I'm too old to fuck her
now. Otherwise I would, though.

401
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:11,370
We're having fun, aren't we,
paid subordinate? We have fun.

402
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,560
The fact that Berlusconi is an
irrepressible horndog is funny,

403
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:21,450
but those parties featured
a 17-year-old girl

404
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,410
who Berlusconi paid for sex.

405
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:26,570
When the scandal broke,
his response was less than charming.

406
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,600
I have always worked
with no interruption

407
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,580
and if it sometimes happens to me
to see the face of a beautiful girl,

408
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,590
better to
like girls than to be gay.

409
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,360
That's a terrible thing to say

410
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,360
and it's not connected to the terrible
thing you're being accused of.

411
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,440
He's basically
Bernie Madoff saying:

412
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,460
"Better to be a complete crook
than to be Puerto Rican."

413
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,500
Fuck you, Bernie!
How did you just make this worse?

414
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:01,460
On the world stage, Berlusconi's
diplomacy left a lot to be desired.

415
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,370
He joked more than once that
Obama was "tanned"

416
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,440
and made a comment about Merkel
that was so controversial,

417
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:11,540
he was confronted about it
in an awkward interview.

418
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,520
You have a problem
with Angela Merkel?

419
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,480
Is it true you called her
an unfuckable lard-arse?

420
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,390
I would never come...
I have never, in... Excuse me.

421
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:37,520
I have never, in twenty years of
politics, insulted anybody. Ever.

422
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:43,360
Please Silvio, your words say
no, but your face, silence,

423
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,460
and history of human interactions
say "si."

424
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:52,580
Someone who looks like "this" should
never say a thing about anyone else.

425
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,480
He looks like what would happen
if a smoked brisket fucked Andy Garcia.

426
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,260
Berlusconi's closest friend
on the world stage is Vladimir Putin.

427
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:08,450
Berlusconi once gave Putin this
bedspread with a picture of them on it.

428
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,360
Which isn't just creepy,
it's pointless.

429
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,470
Putin doesn't sleep
in a bed at night.

430
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,270
He just sits in a chair and stares
at a potato until it bakes.

431
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:25,250
If you think having a bedspread made
of you and your friend is childish,

432
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:29,260
that's because Berlusconi is nothing
if he is not a gigantic child.

433
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:33,320
He even had a remote-controlled
volcano built in his house,

434
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,480
featuring everything from fire
to artificial earth tremors.

435
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:41,460
This thing was realistic, Berlusconi's
neighbors were so alarmed

436
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,480
by the belching flames,
they called the fire brigade.

437
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,320
I would love to show you
a photo of it,

438
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,360
but we can't
find one anywhere.

439
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:57,320
It's not like there aren't hundreds
of ludicrous photos with Berlusconi.

440
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,780
Here is one of him receiving
a rifle from Gaddafi.

441
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,630
Here is one of him and Putin
wearing matching furry hats.

442
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,590
And here is one of him dressed
like Pitbull at a slumber party.

443
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,590
A photo of a belching
inhome volcano

444
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:14,590
wouldn't even be in his
top three weirdest photos.

445
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:18,650
But what is even more amazing
about Berlusconi's comeback is,

446
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,790
Italy was done with him.

447
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,590
He left office after he was
convicted of tax fraud,

448
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,770
and his conviction in 2013
included banning him

449
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,800
from serving in public
office for six years.

450
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:35,620
I know what you may be thinking:
2013 plus six is 2019.

451
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,780
We did crunch
the numbers on that all week,

452
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,580
and it turns out,
it is a year from now.

453
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:45,600
Berlusconi is still banned.
He's been going on a charm offensive,

454
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:49,680
with videos online of him either
snuggling with a baby lamb,

455
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:54,710
or getting to second base with
an inappropriately young sheep.

456
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,780
He's positioning himself
as a kingmaker in this election

457
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,580
and may well end up having a key
role in picking the next leader.

458
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:06,610
And that is not good.
His alliance includes Matteo Salvini,

459
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:11,680
the game-show fascist, who could
well get a high-powered position.

460
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:16,460
So really,
you have to feel for Italy here,

461
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,610
the outcomes do not look good,
there are a lot of bad options,

462
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:23,520
from an awful prime minister
to no outright winner,

463
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,580
plunging Italy into political limbo.

464
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,650
There's actually one more wild card:
under Italian law,

465
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:35,450
the governing coalition
could still pick a non politician

466
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,650
who's had nothing to do
with this campaign so far.

467
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,580
It could be some random jackass
that Italy has never heard of.

468
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,620
If you don't see
where I'm going with this

469
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,600
you've clearly never seen
this fucking show before.

470
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:52,530
We asked half a dozen
Italian legal experts

471
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,460
and while they told me I couldn't
run for prime minister of Italy,

472
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,520
they admitted there is no explicit
provision in the constitution

473
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:03,880
that says: "non-citizens
can't run for prime minister."

474
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,880
As far as I'm concerned,

475
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:10,940
we have ourselves
an "Air Bud" scenario.

476
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,890
The rules of basketball did not
explicitly state that he couldn't play.

477
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,780
Next thing you know,
the dog's dunking.

478
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:23,800
I am that dog, Italy.
So ally-oop, motherfuckers.

479
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:30,970
I'd make just as good a leader
as many of your political figures.

480
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,940
A party started by a comedian?
Technically, I'm one of those.

481
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,820
You like politicians
who appear on TV with animals?

482
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,970
Please. It's like Jumanji up in here.
Someone bring me my lambo!

483
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,930
Bring me my lambo.
Hello there, buddy.

484
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,930
Look at that, see!
You adorable little creature!

485
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,800
Do you like this, Italy?
Of course you do!

486
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,970
Yes, exactly. There's plenty
more where this came from.

487
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,770
I've got 40 lambs backstage.
Thank you so much.

488
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,980
Arrivederci. Italy!
You seem to like candidates

489
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:10,010
who've appeared as contestants
on Italian game shows.

490
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,800
Sadly,
I have not actually done that.

491
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:15,990
Since you are swimming
in fake news over there,

492
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:19,930
I see no reason not to lie
and tell you that I have.

493
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,840
Here is me
on an old Italian game show.

494
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:35,040
I would like to solve the puzzle.
FASTA FRIMAVERA!

495
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:43,810
"Fasta Frimavera?"
No! Pasta Primavera!

496
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,970
- You stupid English idiot!
- What an idiot!

497
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:50,850
Yes, yes, really...Boo!

498
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,940
Boo this idiot with glasses!

499
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,910
Stupid!

500
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,890
Why did I go to the trouble
of faking a game show in which I lost?

501
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,860
I think deep down,
it's just who I am.

502
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:21,910
I know that Berlusconi has
a remote control volcano

503
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,800
that he won't let you see.

504
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:29,810
Well, Italia,
I'll let you see mine.

505
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,860
Yes.

506
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,010
Yes.

507
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:43,910
Yes Italy. Tremble before
the awesome power of Mount Olivo!

508
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,940
My candidacy for prime minister may be
a complete and total farce.

509
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:52,920
But be honest: incredibly,
I am far from your worst option!

510
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:56,030
That's our show!
See you next week! Good night!

511
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,030
LAST WEEK TONIGHT

512
