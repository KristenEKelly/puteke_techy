00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,920
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,760
SEASON V
EPISODE 17

3
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,760
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,400
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,520
A quick recap of the week,
a week which saw the president,

6
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,880
a man who claims he speaks
for the forgotten working class,

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,920
managed to get an applause line
in a speech from this.

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,280
We got more money, brains,
better houses, apartments,

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,160
we got nicer boats,
we're smarter than they are.

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,120
And they say the elite.
We're the elite. You're the elite.

11
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,640
"We have nicer boats
than they do."

12
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,320
Aside from the fact he's delivering
that speech in Fargo, North Dakota,

13
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,680
which is landlocked, that is
a weird message for a populist.

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,720
It's like running as a socialist
under the slogan:

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,800
"the workers are parasites !
Sponsored by Pringles."

16
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,280
The biggest and most historic news
this week came on Wednesday.

17
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,600
Tonight the biggest change for
the Supreme Court in half a century.

18
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,120
Swing Justice, Anthony Kennedy,
announcing his retirement

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,880
giving Trump another seat to fill
and conservatives a shot

20
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,280
at dominating the highest court
for years.

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,720
This is huge news and for anyone
who believes that the Constitution

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,560
protects things like reproductive
and LGBT rights: this is bad.

23
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,720
We know it's bad because
Donald Trump Jr. was happy,

24
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,000
tweeting: "OMG ! Just when you thought
this week couldn't get more lit..."

25
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,360
"I give you Anthony Kennedy's
retirement from hashtag SCOTUS."

26
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,560
I'm going to have to disagree
with Mr. Junior on this.

27
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,480
I don't think this was lit at all.
It's obvs cray a-f,

28
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,680
no one is denying that, fam.

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,640
This week's news was neither lit nor
on fleek. Nor was it three fire emojis.

30
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,600
Now, granted, I am still
a little shook, j-s-y-k.

31
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,880
I believe Kennedy's
retirement is super werpt.

32
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,200
I'm happy to announce that
all the slang words I just used

33
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,200
are now officially dead forever.

34
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,600
That includes "werpt"
a term that doesn't even exist,

35
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,480
but which I have preemptively
ruined just in case.

36
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,160
Teens: don't let white men in
their 40s hear the cool words you use.

37
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,560
We will bury them.

38
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,880
The big question here is:
who is going to replace Kennedy ?

39
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,400
Administration made their plans
clear, Mike Pence tweeting:

40
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,440
"thank you to Justice Anthony Kennedy
for your long career of service,"

41
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,400
"Trump will nominate a strong
conservative in tradition of Scalia".

42
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,760
You don't generally stand up
at someone's retirement party

43
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,640
and say: "thank you for everything
you did for this company, Robert,"

44
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,440
"we will replace you with someone
like that other guy who work here"

45
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,840
"that we always liked
much more than you."

46
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,520
Trump has a list of nominees assembled
with Conservative Federalist Society,

47
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,680
whose vice president seems
confident in their choices.

48
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,880
- A leading contender for you ?
- No, there's not.

49
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,440
- Really not ?
- No, the list is really good.

50
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,280
They're not in order ?
You're just saying anyone.

51
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,040
You can throw a dart at that list
and you'd be fine.

52
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,160
That will be this president's
entire decision-making process.

53
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,840
There's also a non-zero chance
he could hit Pence and call it a day.

54
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,280
It is understandable that Democrats
are trying to game out arguments

55
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,960
that would let them
delay Trump's nomination.

56
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,200
They've appealed to Mitch McConnell's
sense of fairness and consistency,

57
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,640
by pointing out that he refused
to confirm Merrick Garland.

58
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,600
McConnell couldn't give a flying
fuck about fairness or consistency.

59
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,760
Some Democrats have now been
forced to move on to plan B.

60
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,720
The President of the US is a subject
of an ongoing criminal investigation,

61
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,000
an investigation that could end up
before the Supreme Court.

62
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:22,600
I do not believe that this committee
should or can in good conscience

63
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,600
consider a nominee put forward
until that investigation is concluded.

64
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,720
A fundamental problem: Republicans
have 51 seats in the Senate

65
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,240
and they need 51 votes
to confirm the new Justice.

66
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,080
Unless Democrats can convince their
party to oppose the nomination

67
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,920
and persuade a number of Republicans
to their side, they're out of luck.

68
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,040
Time
for Democrats' favorite game:

69
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,120
Hope ! Susan ! Collins ! Flips !
And ! Be ! Disappointed !

70
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,200
When ! She ! Doesn't !

71
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,760
It's America's most depressing
game show.

72
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,320
The consequences here will
certainly be extremely grim.

73
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,560
Watch CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin
seemingly visit every show on CNN

74
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,400
to do whatever
the opposite of sugarcoating is.

75
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,840
Roe v. Wade is doomed, it is gone
because Donald Trump won the election.

76
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,920
Abortion will be illegal in
a significant part of the US soon.

77
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,840
All this fantasy talk about:
Roe v. Wade is going to be overturned.

78
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,640
It's gonna be overturned !

79
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:33,800
Roe v. Wade is going to disappear.
It arrived in 1973 and it will die.

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,960
I heard you say earlier that
within eighteen months,

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,280
that abortion could be illegal
in as many as 20 states.

82
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,440
No, I said abortion will be illegal
in as many as twenty states.

83
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,640
Roe v. Wade is dead today.

84
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,600
I would not want to hear Toobin tell
his daughter their dog passed away.

85
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,640
Sweetheart, Baxter
was taken to a farm upstate.

86
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,440
And then shot in the face.
He's dead now. He's dead.

87
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,320
He's got no face anymore.

88
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,960
There is actually
some good news.

89
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,760
There is a constitutional loophole
that allows Democrats to...

90
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,080
I'm obviously lying. There is no good
news here. Everything is terrible now.

91
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,360
Barring some massive screw up
from Trump,

92
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,520
the only thing anyone
can do now is vote.

93
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,360
There are actually two key elections
you should try and vote in:

94
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,040
one in 2016 and one in 2014,
that is what got us into this mess.

95
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,600
Find a medium-sized
cardboard box right now.

96
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,560
Take a pen and write "time machine"
on the side of it.

97
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,320
Not because it'll take you backwards
in time, it's a cardboard box.

98
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,160
I want you to scream into it.

99
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,160
Empty all the anger and frustration
into that box.

100
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,840
Tape it up, go out, vote, knock
on doors and take that box with you.

101
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,280
If you come across someone who
is thinking of sitting out,

102
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,320
because neither of the candidates
quite do it for them,

103
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,120
open that box
into their fucking face

104
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,120
and let yourself from this week
scream some sense into them.

105
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,720
And now, this.

106
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,360
For Canada Day, the most
Canadian thing imaginable:

107
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,480
polite interactions
between professional curlers

108
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,920
at the 2018
Tim Horton's National Championship.

109
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,160
- Do you like this better or this ?
- I think the back one.

110
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,880
Bumper. We played this shot
a few ends ago ?

111
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,520
Yeah, I did.

112
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,240
I've only got four-fifths.

113
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,560
- What ?
- I don't have all the rock.

114
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,360
- You don't have all of it ?
- Nope.

115
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,560
Decent chance
we're gonna lose that, but...

116
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,800
What's that ?

117
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,640
Said decent chance
we're gonna lose that, but...

118
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,240
Do you wanna just play it soft
and down to it and bump it ?

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,840
Well or we could play like hack ?

120
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,480
I'm good with hack.

121
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:14,640
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns science.

122
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,080
Math disguised as dinosaurs and
outer-space to seem interesting.

123
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,800
This story concerns gene editing.
A topic you may have heard about,

124
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,320
it's now a plot point
in action movies like "Rampage".

125
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,720
What's happening to my friend ?

126
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,080
Are you familiar
with "genetic editing" ?

127
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,320
Changes will be
incredibly unpredictable.

128
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,400
Is he the only one ?

129
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,080
Didn't know
about the thirty-foot wolf ?

130
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,800
Incoming !

131
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,360
Wait just a second there.
Let me get this straight:

132
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,080
this is a movie about aerial military
equipment being harnessed

133
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,760
to fight a 30-foot wolf and
it is not called "Wolf Blitzer" ?

134
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,360
That is a huge missed opportunity.
That's movie malpractice there.

135
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,520
Gene editing isn't only showing up

136
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,280
in movies starring
Rock "The Dwayne" Johnson.

137
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,880
It's brought up on TV, with varying
degrees of excitement or alarm.

138
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,560
A stunning and controversial
breakthrough: gene editing.

139
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,480
This is a milestone that could
one day erase hereditary conditions.

140
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,480
Some fear the technology could be
used to create "designer babies".

141
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,800
This technology has the potential
to change our DNA

142
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,400
and the DNA of all organisms
alive and extinct.

143
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,320
Could that lead to eugenics ? Could
that lead to new divides in humanity ?

144
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,400
I don't know,
that stuff's scary.

145
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,960
Exactly, it seems gene editing
is either going to cure all disease

146
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,040
or kill every last one of us.

147
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,800
Anytime there is a bold new technology,
people do tend to go nuts.

148
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,080
After the invention of the refrigerator
there were a rash of headlines like:

149
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,600
"Can Meat Be Too Cold ?"

150
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,760
and "What About Milkman, America's
Friendly Neighborhood Weirdo ?"

151
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,200
We thought we'd talk
about gene editing:

152
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,440
what its potential could be
and what the chances are

153
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,440
that we're all gonna be killed
by a thirty-foot wolf.

154
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,520
Let's start with the fact
that gene editing isn't new,

155
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,880
there have been technologies
like these around for years.

156
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,720
What is new and what is driving
a lot of recent coverage is "CRISPR",

157
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,120
which stands for "Crunchy Rectums
In Sassy Pink Ray-Bans."

158
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,000
Except it doesn't, it stands for this.
But you won't remember that

159
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,600
so let's go back
to the crunchy rectum thing.

160
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,000
CRISPR is complicated. One of the key
scientists who unlocked its potential,

161
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,400
Jennifer Doudna, has a simple
way of explaining how it works.

162
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,240
I like to use the analogy
of word processing.

163
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,520
You think of the DNA code
like the text of a document,

164
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,120
this is the scissors,
it allows you to cut out text,

165
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,160
the cell takes over
after the DNA is broken

166
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,680
and makes a precise change
at the site of the repair.

167
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,840
Right that is very basically it:
like cut-and-paste in Microsoft Word:

168
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,320
if there's something that you want
to fix on DNA, with CRISPR,

169
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,000
you could theoretically find it,
cut it out, and paste in a fix,

170
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,360
at which point
Clippy shows up and says:

171
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,400
"You're trying to play God and alter
the basic building blocks of life !"

172
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,800
"Need some help?"

173
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,000
CRISPR's potential is huge, there
are hopes that it might be applied

174
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,200
to more than 10 000 conditions,
from sickle-cell anemia

175
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,800
to cystic fibrosis to some cases
of early-onset Alzheimer's.

176
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,320
Gene editing is wildly difficult.
Diseases have multiple genes.

177
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:48,080
Human trials have been rare, although
there have been promising results.

178
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,280
Just months ago baby Layla was dying
of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

179
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,440
Doctors agreed to try out an
experimental immune-cell therapy,

180
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,920
which had never been used
outside the lab.

181
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,360
The result astounded her parents.

182
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,840
I took the gamble and this
is her today standing, laughing.

183
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,120
It's a miracle.

184
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,280
That's fantastic and he's right,
it is a miracle.

185
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,920
Except when you think about it,
it's science.

186
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,680
Is better and
more convenient than a miracle.

187
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,760
You don't have to spend the next 2 000
years worshipping the scientists.

188
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,640
You can just be like: "thanks".

189
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,760
While that is a truly amazing story,
for the most part,

190
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,840
applications have been confined
to experiments on plants and animals.

191
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,680
Results have been
striking, if often weird.

192
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,880
Researchers at this lab used CRISPR
to isolate and manipulate

193
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,640
the beagle's muscle,
or myostatin gene,

194
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,960
making these the most
muscular beagles in the world.

195
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,120
Okay, all right...

196
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,760
You might think it's strange that
scientists made jacked, sexy beagles.

197
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,320
Did you consider that the scientists
were lady beagles ?

198
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,840
Change your preconceptions
about what a scientist can be.

199
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,800
Hashtag beagle feminism.
Hashtag sciencebitches.

200
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,840
It's not just beefcake beagles.

201
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,400
Scientists are researching ways
to fight human diseases using mice.

202
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,480
While scientists know how painstakingly
slow this kind of research is,

203
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,680
it is tempting for the rest of us
to start racing ahead,

204
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,520
speculating about
where this is all going.

205
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,160
Could CRISPR give us unicorns ?

206
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:32,440
We're getting creative now.
There are examples of animals

207
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,320
that have single horns in the middle
so like the rhinoceros has one,

208
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,400
but there are ancient rhinoceroses
that have it in the middle of the head,

209
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,000
so you could get a single horn
on a horse

210
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,720
by looking at horns in other species.

211
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,320
- It's in the realm of possibility ?
- Yes.

212
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,800
Judging by all the hedging
he just did in that answer,

213
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,400
even if we do create a unicorn,
it's not gonna be this majestic creature

214
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,360
who wants you to follow it
into a magic waterfall.

215
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,400
It'll be more like this:
a monster that would beg:

216
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,520
"please kill me, end this.
End this madness now."

217
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,840
For a good sense of the mismatch
between expectation and capabilities,

218
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,640
look at a project that that scientist
is working on right now:

219
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,720
bringing back
the woolly mammoth.

220
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,480
It has been hyped in
headlines all over the world.

221
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,920
They are nowhere close
to creating a living animal yet,

222
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,400
computer simulations
are underwhelming.

223
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,640
In the lab they've edited about
35 functioning woolly mammoth genes

224
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,920
into the Asian elephant genome.

225
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,080
This is a good start for making
a semi-woolly mammoth.

226
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,520
Yeah, that's not
a woolly mammoth though.

227
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,840
That's just a "wrong elephant".

228
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,800
It's not so much "Jurassic Park" as
an off-brand three-dollar petting zoo

229
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,440
called "pet the whatever".

230
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,400
You may have noticed you're not
just seeing professional scientists.

231
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,720
That's because the underlying
technology of CRISPR is so cheap,

232
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,640
almost anyone can use it.

233
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,840
Gene-editing stories almost
always feature a detour

234
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,200
to meet biohackers
like Josiah Zayner.

235
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,160
Here in the Bay Area, we're visiting
a biohacker in his garage.

236
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,000
He's selling DIY CRISPR kits
for a couple of hundred dollars.

237
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,720
You can buy this cutting-edge kit
that allows you to use this technology.

238
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:31,280
You don't need a PhD and
you could do experiments

239
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,760
with CRISPR like that
I think is really cool.

240
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,320
That sounds revolutionary,
but selling strangers things

241
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,800
covered in unfamiliar DNA out
of your garage already has a name

242
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,840
and it's "every single garage
sale in human history."

243
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,120
I would like to buy your lamp,
I'm going to take it home and wash it.

244
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,240
He is selling chemistry sets.
And to the extent

245
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,840
that they get people excited about
science, that's a good thing.

246
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,200
You can see why scientists
get frustrated when biohackers

247
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,920
hog all the media attention,

248
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,920
especially because he makes
wild statements, like:

249
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,920
I want to live in a world where people
get drunk and instead of tattoos,

250
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,120
they're like, "I'm drunk, I'm
going to CRISPR myself."

251
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,800
Which is a terrible idea.

252
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,320
You shouldn't even get drunk
and tattoo yourself,

253
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,280
however cool "Robert Duvall's face
covering your midriff" seems.

254
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,920
I'm just saying
I have some regrets.

255
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,320
Last October, Zayner publicly
injected himself

256
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,120
with DNA modified using CRISPR, to try
and give himself bigger muscles.

257
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,760
Which did not work.
But in that same video,

258
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,840
he argued that using CRISPR should
ideally be like downloading an app.

259
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,320
You don't have to know
what the app does, how it works.

260
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,560
That's how it should be with genetic
engineering and synthetic biology.

261
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:00,280
Why can't people use this technology
without knowing how it works ?

262
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,040
I can answer that one for you:

263
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,720
because it could be dangerous,
and someone could get hurt.

264
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,920
I refuse to take scientific insights

265
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,280
from someone shooting vertical footage
on an iPhone.

266
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,440
That is unforgivable,
that is disqualifying immediately.

267
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,320
Though Zayner now says
he regrets that experiment,

268
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,800
that kind of behavior is a real
worry for serious scientists,

269
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,760
not just that a biohacker
will hurt themselves,

270
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,320
but that doctors or scientists
might rush a human application

271
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,360
before it's ready, things go wrong
and the whole field is set back years.

272
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,880
That happened to the field
of gene therapy,

273
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,720
when Jesse Gelsinger died
during a poorly-designed trial.

274
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,640
That's not the only thing
scientists worry about,

275
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,320
the benefits and the drawbacks
of gene editing

276
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,640
can extend well beyond one person.

277
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,760
To understand why,
be familiar with a key distinction.

278
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,720
Somatic cells are most
of the cells in the body:

279
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,120
blood, brain, skin cells, where the DNA
doesn't get passed down to offspring.

280
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,480
Germline edits involve sperm,
eggs or embryos,

281
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,680
changing the DNA
of future generations.

282
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,800
Exactly,
somatic cells die with you,

283
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,080
germline cells get passed down
through generations.

284
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,360
Much of what you've seen,
like Baby Layla or Zayner's experiment,

285
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,040
involved somatic cells.

286
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,920
While germline cells are how
my great grandfather passed this nose

287
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,640
down to me, when he fucked this bird,
Great-Grandma Feathers.

288
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,200
She loved bells.

289
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,560
Germline editing could potentially
do incredible things.

290
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,360
Take malaria: nearly half a million
people each year die from it

291
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,160
and it's spread by mosquitos.

292
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,040
Gene editing could help stop that,
through a "gene drive".

293
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,640
Scientists insert an artificial gene
into the DNA of mosquito embryos

294
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,440
that will make an increasing
proportion of female offspring sterile.

295
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,760
The gene drive is embedded
in the DNA

296
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,280
to ensure
the changes are inherited,

297
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,880
unlike natural evolution
where chance is involved.

298
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,280
That's brilliant. And much simpler
than my idea to fight malaria,

299
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,400
by fitting millions of mosquitoes
with tiny condoms.

300
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,080
The moment you cross into germline
editing, the ramifications increase,

301
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,680
messing with any ecosystem
can have unintended consequences.

302
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,720
This has always been true,
even before gene editing

303
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,440
and my favorite example
comes from Australia,

304
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,000
where about 100 cane toads
were introduced in the 1930s

305
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,760
to control the cane beetle.

306
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,600
They didn't do that.
What they did do was multiply

307
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,880
to hundreds of millions of cane toads
and wreaked absolute havoc.

308
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,840
Australians hate these things.
There was even a documentary made,

309
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,120
featuring a guy who made it his life's
work to run over as many as he could.

310
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,640
I line them up with
the driver's side front wheel.

311
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,080
I seem to be able to get most
I line up on the right-hand side.

312
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,800
I really go out of my way to run
over cane toads basically

313
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,920
because I have a very profound love
of the wildlife that occurs naturally.

314
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,160
If it was possible to remove them and
totally eradicate them from Australia

315
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,960
and I was capable of doing it,
I would spend a lot of time doing that.

316
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,600
He is in for an unpleasant surprise
when he gets to the pearly gates

317
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,400
and finds out that God
is an Australian cane toad.

318
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,040
So, you'd like to get
into heaven ?

319
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,000
Why don't we go ahead
and take a look at the tapes.

320
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,040
Ecosystems are delicate, which is why
you need to be extremely careful.

321
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,880
A good example of someone taking
that sort of care with gene editing

322
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,280
can be seen in a project on Nantucket
Island, as a way to fight Lyme disease.

323
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,440
Lyme disease is passed
from ticks to humans,

324
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,480
but before that can happen,
it goes from mice to ticks.

325
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,480
The way that works is like this:
a mouse goes through a tough breakup.

326
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,960
A relationship the mouse
didn't want to end

327
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,440
and leaves it questioning
its self-worth.

328
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,040
He goes on rebound dates
that only deepen the disillusionment.

329
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,040
"Could anyone love me ?".
Turns to alcohol to numb the pain.

330
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,160
While drunk, it comes across
a Tinder profile of a tick.

331
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,480
At first the mouse is disgusted,
but then it's intrigued.

332
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,560
"God," it thinks,
"am I really going to fuck a tick ?"

333
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,080
The mouse goes on the date thinking:
"it's just a date, we're just talking."

334
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,680
As soon as the tick says:

335
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,000
"maybe we should go some place
quiet where we can talk..."

336
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,880
They're banging in the shower.

337
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,840
The mouse feels strangely satisfied.
It feels desirable again.

338
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,520
As for the tick, it can't wait to brag
that it just fucked a mouse !

339
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,800
They both forget the encounter
until eight months later,

340
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,920
when the tick gets a call:
bad news, you got Lyme disease !

341
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,080
And that is how Lyme disease
spreads from mice to ticks.

342
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,080
Sometimes. Other times,
the tick bites the mouse.

343
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,600
To prevent the spread of Lyme disease,
a biologist named Kevin Esvelt

344
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,720
is considering introducing
genetically-edited mice

345
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,960
that cannot pass
the disease to ticks.

346
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,720
And he would do this with caution,
testing it on an uninhabited island,

347
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,080
where the experiment
will be contained.

348
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,120
It would only go forward on Nantucket
if he got the buy-in of the locals.

349
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,000
Even with all those safeguards,
he's aware of the uncertainty.

350
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,880
Although Kevin Esvelt is confident
his engineered mice

351
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
will only reduce Lyme disease and
not bring harm to ecosystems,

352
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,600
he also knows that absolute certainty
and genetic engineering

353
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,040
do not go together.

354
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,120
I worry I might be missing
something profound

355
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,640
about the consequences
of what we're developing.

356
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,600
Good ! I'm glad you do.

357
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,240
That is the caution that you want
from someone in his position.

358
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,920
He doesn't want
to end up in a limerick that goes:

359
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,840
There once was a man from Nantucket,
Who gathered some mice in a bucket.

360
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,760
He altered those mice engineered,
And now all of the seagulls are dead.

361
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,440
There aren't just practical
considerations to germline editing,

362
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,960
there are huge moral questions, too,
when it comes to humans.

363
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,880
It raises the possibility
that gene editing could one day be used

364
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,520
not just to fight disease,
but for so-called "enhancement",

365
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,560
which sails you into some
pretty dicey territory.

366
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,680
Even Jennifer Doudna,
one of the pioneers of CRISPR,

367
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,240
sees the danger of this.

368
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,440
Here she is, telling the story
of a dream that she once had

369
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,280
that was pretty on-the-nose.

370
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,840
I walked into a room and
a colleague of mine said to me:

371
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,800
"I'd like you to explain
the CRISPR technology to a friend."

372
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,440
And he brought me into a room

373
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:44,360
and a person was sitting
with their back to me.

374
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:50,000
As they turned around I realized
with horror that it was Hitler.

375
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,080
It was Hitler with sort of a pig nose
and it almost looked like

376
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,400
a chimeric pig-human
sort of creature.

377
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,800
She had a dream about pig Hitler
wanting to learn more about CRISPR.

378
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,240
Ethical reservations aside,
she might also want to examine

379
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,720
why her subconscious
thinks her colleague

380
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,880
is "casually friends with Hitler".

381
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,560
The more control people have over
the ability to design their children,

382
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,120
the bigger the moral
questions that raises,

383
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,040
up to and including who decides
what constitutes a genetic problem

384
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,640
that needs to be "fixed".

385
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,680
Is deafness a disease ?

386
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,800
Many in the deaf community
would say it is not.

387
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,280
Is dwarfism a disease ?
Many would say not.

388
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,080
The idea that we're all sick,
that I "suffer" from dwarfism...

389
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,440
I live with dwarfism. I've lived
with dwarfism for 39 years.

390
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,520
I am proud to be a second generation
raising a third generation of people

391
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,960
living with dwarfism,
I suffer from how society treats me.

392
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,440
Exactly. And there are many groups
who could justifiably worry

393
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,400
that the thing that makes
them unique or different,

394
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,040
could come to be seen
as flaws to be corrected.

395
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,560
Eugenics is a word
that rightly terrifies people.

396
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,760
It's why it was such a mistake
for Eugene Levy to make that

397
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,720
the title of his autobiography.

398
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,960
It's a shame. It was a lovely book. He
had great Catherine O'Hara anecdotes.

399
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,120
But that title really dusted you off.

400
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,680
Here is the thing: germline-edited,

401
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,960
designer CRISPR babies
are still a distant hypothetical.

402
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,720
No human has been born that has
had its germline edited yet.

403
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,560
Many countries have bans
or restrictions on that.

404
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,200
One place with very few restrictions
is China, which in general,

405
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,880
seems eager to push
the limits of gene editing.

406
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,040
One of the scientists
working at that jacked beagle lab

407
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,760
seems to brush off
certain ethical issues.

408
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,920
CRISPR puts so much power
into our hands.

409
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,360
It allows us to shape our world
in ways never before imagined.

410
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,080
There are many people in the U.S.
who think:

411
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,400
that's not for us to do, that's
for a higher power, that's for God.

412
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,560
So the idea that we could be
playing the role of God

413
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,440
makes a lot of people nervous.

414
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,480
- Clearly not here though !
- Yeah, not here.

415
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,680
That guy seems blasé
about gene-editing technology.

416
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,200
Surprising,
in a country whose president,

417
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,680
as you may remember,
is a honey-eating talking bear.

418
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,880
The resemblance is striking.
I don't know which is which.

419
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:33,080
My point here in showing you
all of this isn't to frighten you,

420
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,040
there is a lot to be legitimately
excited about here.

421
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,160
Gene editing has potential to alleviate
a great deal of human suffering.

422
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,640
But reaching that potential
will require careful research,

423
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,320
the science involved is much
more complicated

424
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,520
than we've had time to get into,
mainly because we needed

425
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,960
to make space for that long story
about a tick fucking a mouse

426
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,960
and I stand by that decision.

427
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,440
While that research is progressing,
we need to figure out how to balance

428
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,240
the risks and potential rewards
of gene editing.

429
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,280
Everything that's being done
tends to get mixed together.

430
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,440
Meticulous, professional scientists
with freewheeling biohackers,

431
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,240
practical applications
with wild theories,

432
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,560
best-case scenarios with catastrophic
prophecies of thirty-foot wolves.

433
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,280
But we are going to need to sort
out where lines should be drawn.

434
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,800
While gene editing could do incredible
things for our health,

435
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,920
let's try and avoid a future where
we end up swerving all over the road,

436
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,760
trying to run over all of the pig
Hitlers we accidentally created.

437
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,520
And now, this.

438
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,440
Guys, what the fuck's going on
with animals in Florida ?

439
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,600
One of those where else
but in Florida stories.

440
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,440
Passengers from Boston were
welcomed by an alligator on the tarmac.

441
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,600
Wild boars are getting bold.

442
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,440
- A cobra's on the loose.
- Wild monkeys are on the loose.

443
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,520
Pet monkey attack
at a Home Depot.

444
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,120
An alligator found itself inside
a local furniture store.

445
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,280
The three-foot gator inside a Wawa.

446
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,560
Three sightings of the large
lizards in just the last year.

447
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,800
I've never ran
into an iguana that big.

448
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,240
Bear biting incident.

449
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,840
- Bobcat strolled into a home.
- A bobcat caught a shark.

450
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,160
Wild horse
attacked a large alligator.

451
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,200
- Python versus alligator.
- Two alligators go head to head.

452
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,480
Police still have a lot of questions
about a swan attack.

453
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,480
A dog and a swan
got into a battle.

454
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,680
It's good to watch the beauty
of these swans, from afar.

455
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,960
That's our show. We're off for the next
few weeks. Back July 29th. Good night !

456
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,920
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

457
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,720
END OF EPISODE 17,
SEASON V
