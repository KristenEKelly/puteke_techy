LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,520
SEASON V
EPISODE 5

3
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,880
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,960
Thank you for joining us.
A quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,160
Trump White House. Rated #1 place
to work by "Subpoena Magazine !"

6
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,720
Almost everyone in the White House
was about to get fired

7
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,040
and it started with
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

8
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,120
Reports said he found out from
a Trump tweet, which is embarrassing.

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,520
But the White House claimed
he'd actually gotten a headsup,

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,080
in an even
more humiliating manner.

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,080
Rex Tillerson was on the toilet when
he learned he was getting canned.

12
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,360
It's true: apparently,
Tillerson had a stomach bug

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,880
when John Kelly informed him.

14
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,080
Rex, deep down, when
you took this job,

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,000
you knew
it would end like this.

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,840
Maybe not "specifically" like this,
but in terms of dignity, frustration

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,240
and a general sense of nausea:
this was where it was heading.

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,160
Instead of getting sucked
down a White House rabbit hole,

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,360
let's instead focus on Russia.

20
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,440
Where the movie
"The Revenant"

21
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,920
was marketed as
"lucky man has fun time."

22
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,880
Russia has been the center
of allegations

23
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,800
regarding former agent, Sergei Skripal
who, along with his daughter,

24
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,440
was found poisoned
on a park bench in Britain.

25
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,840
It seemed there was a
consensus on who was responsible.

26
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,600
The US joined European leaders
in blaming Russia for poisoning

27
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,920
a former spy, Sergei Skripal.

28
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,480
In a joint statement, the U.S.,
Britain, France and Germany

29
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,840
all said that there is
"no plausible alternative explanation"

30
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,520
for the nerve agent attack.

31
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,960
Every country agrees that Russia
did this. Which is incredible.

32
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,160
We can't get the world to agree on
a single shape for electrical outlets.

33
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,760
What is that one by the way ?

34
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,640
Looks like I'm plugging my laptop
into the killer from "Scream".

35
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,320
The Russian government hasn't gone
out of its way to not look suspicious.

36
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,400
The Kremlin-controlled media have
been making fun of Britain.

37
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,160
"If you're a professional traitor,"
he says,

38
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,560
"my advice, don't move to England."

39
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,880
Something's not right there,
the climate, perhaps.

40
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,560
But too many bad things go on
there, people are hanged, poisoned,

41
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,840
helicopter crashes,
or they fall out of windows.

42
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,640
It's not every day that you hear
a news anchor sound like a mob boss.

43
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,720
Breaking news: it would be
real shame if wise guy

44
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,360
who thinks he can make fool of us
has terrible thing happen to him.

45
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,840
Maybe he fall out of poisoned
window into helicopter blade.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,120
Or maybe he keep
his fucking mouth shut here.

47
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,840
Here's Linda with the weather.

48
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,360
Now, for his part, Putin was
interviewed by Russian state TV

49
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,160
and he used one phrase
that was a little jarring.

50
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,640
Those who serve us with poison

51
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,920
will eventually swallow it
and poison themselves.

52
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,080
"Those who serve us poison
will poison themselves."

53
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,480
Who would have thought
that Putin's approach to his enemies

54
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,640
would be the same as the employee
meal policy at Denny's ?

55
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,320
You told the "moon over my hammy"
sandwich was delicious ?

56
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,440
You prove it. You eat it
in front of everyone right now.

57
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,320
Russia's been gearing
up for its presidential election,

58
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,160
which took place this morning.

59
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,120
We can now reveal that
the winner was Hillary Clinton !

60
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,080
How fab ! No, I'm kidding !

61
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,280
I'm kidding !

62
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,320
People don't like her. At all.
Not even a little bit.

63
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,840
The winner was the poison guy.

64
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,680
And Putin's win
isn't really much of a surprise,

65
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,400
given that three potential candidates
didn't make it onto the ballot.

66
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,840
Alexei Navalny was barred
from running,

67
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,120
thanks to politically
motivated embezzlement charges,

68
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Garry Kasparov fled,
he fears political persecution

69
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,520
and Boris Nemtsov was shot
in the back in 2015.

70
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,040
They were fucked, harried,
and killed. Respectively.

71
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,720
Putin actually bothered to do
campaigning in the past few months.

72
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,000
He even went to Crimea,
peninsula he illegally seized

73
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,520
and turned on the charm.

74
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,360
He gave the home crowd a rare
glimpse of his warm and fuzzy side.

75
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,400
"I", he told them,
"would like to hug you all."

76
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,280
Going on to say: "to death.
I would like to hug you all to death."

77
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,400
"I am Putin." And I am willing to bet
that a hug from him feels

78
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,200
like hugging a frozen
telephone pole with eyes.

79
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,920
The girl group Fabrika
released a song called "Vova Vova",

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,440
referring to Putin's nickname.

81
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,560
They put out a music video,
gyrating to pictures

82
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,800
of a shirtless Putin
and pretending to marry him.

83
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,280
Vova, our boss, beloved Vova.

84
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,760
Vova, handsome
guy, our beloved Vova.

85
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,040
Vova, the boss, beloved Vova.

86
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,440
Vova. Only him.

87
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,880
"Klassna." Who can blame them
for the fantasy of marrying Putin ?

88
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,760
What young woman wouldn't want
to settle down with a 65-year-old

89
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,480
whose ex-wife once said of him:
"Unfortunately, he is a vampire."

90
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,680
It's a fairy tale !
Of all the pro-Putin propaganda,

91
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,480
my favorite involved a group
called "Infrastructure of Charity".

92
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,000
They sponsored a contest
in which children

93
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,400
draw pictures of Putin
and the results were sensational.

94
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,720
Let me just show you. Putin wearing
a wolf skin and feathers,

95
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,360
playing in a hockey game
with zero fans in attendance,

96
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,360
Putin dressed
as Lucille Ball going fishing,

97
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,160
talking to his doctor about
why his head keeps shrinking,

98
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,000
a terrifying
six-armed spider-Putin,

99
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,680
Putin dressed as The Joker
suckling a camel,

100
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,800
Putin frolicking with two
extremely "DTF" furries,

101
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,880
rolling on ecstasy he thinks his tie
is a grey and purple croissant,

102
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,000
and this one, which I would
argue is not of Putin at all,

103
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,560
but rather a picture of David Caruso
teaching a fat dog to swim.

104
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,760
I'm not saying those pictures
tipped the balance here.

105
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:54,920
This election was never in doubt.
But all Putin is famous for,

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,680
oppression, threats
and meddling in elections,

107
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,600
will likely continue
for the foreseeable future.

108
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,840
That is why my
favorite child's drawing was this one,

109
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,800
which shows Putin astride
the world, showering it with love,

110
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,400
but which could just as easily be
the disemboweled organs

111
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,320
of anyone who dares
to cross him.

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,560
And now this.

113
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,200
Local news cannot be trusted
with St. Patrick's Day.

114
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,560
Top o' the morning to ya now.

115
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,320
Top o' the morning to ya.

116
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,240
Top of the morning for ya.
Did I get it now ?

117
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,360
Where are my Lucky Charms ?

118
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,200
They're always stealing
me Lucky Charms.

119
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,600
That, British ?

120
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,680
Luck of the Irish. Is that
a good accent ? Luck of the Irish.

121
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,440
- Top o' the morning to ya, Kurt.
- Same to ya.

122
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,800
- Doing a little jig are ya ?
- My pants are falling down.

123
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,560
It's Leaping Larry,
the largest leprechaun.

124
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:08,520
He really did fall. Are you ok ?
I got your glasses.

125
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,200
Moving on: our main story
concerns Mike Pence.

126
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,720
Vice President of the US and
the opposite of a "silver fox" is.

127
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,520
I'll go with "ashen weasel".

128
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,080
If you're wondering:
why talk about Pence ?

129
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,600
With the focus on
who Trump is firing,

130
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,560
it is worth remembering the one
person that cannot actually happen to.

131
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,160
Trump cannot but see Pence as
the indispensible man in his circle.

132
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:43,000
He is the one person to whom
Donald Trump cannot say "you're fired".

133
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,680
While, in many ways, Pence is like
any other Trump employee,

134
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,560
ethically compromised,
creeped out by Jared

135
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,720
and subjected
to unwanted physical contact,

136
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,960
Pence is the only official in
the White House Trump can't fire.

137
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,880
He is synonymous
with some extreme positions,

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,640
like his opposition to abortion
and gay rights.

139
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,040
Listen to Omarosa, who had
firsthand experience working with him.

140
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,200
We would be begging for days of
Trump back if Pence became president.

141
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,480
He's extreme. I'm Christian,
I love Jesus,

142
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,080
but he thinks Jesus tells him
to say things that are like,

143
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,280
I'm like Jesus ain't say that.

144
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,200
Omarosa is right there.

145
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,200
I'm pretty sure the original title of
the New and Old Testaments were

146
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,000
"Jesus said this"
and "Jesus ain't say that".

147
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,480
If Pence is that terrifying,
let's take a look at him.

148
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,600
If there are any Mike Pence
supporters watching this:

149
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,920
I cannot promise that he is
going to come out looking great,

150
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,520
but I will say something nice
about him before this piece is over.

151
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,200
You have my word on that.
So let's begin.

152
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,120
Pence's reputation is as the old,
boring, principled contrast to Trump.

153
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,680
He's been more than willing
to defend the indefensible.

154
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,880
Pence is exceptionally good
at dodging tough questions.

155
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,600
Look at this interview from just
after Trump tweeted, falsely, he had

156
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,280
"won the popular vote if you deducted
the millions who voted illegally."

157
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,160
Watch how many times Pence
refuses to engage in the premise.

158
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,840
That statement is false.
Why is it responsible to make it ?

159
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,360
I think the president-elect
just wants to call to attention

160
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,520
the fact that that there has been
evidence over many years of...

161
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,040
That's not what he said.

162
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,720
Expressing that reality, Pew Research
Center found evidence of that.

163
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,200
- It's certainly his right.
- To make false statements ?

164
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,920
It's his right to express his
opinion as the president-elect.

165
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,640
One of the things that's
refreshing about our president-elect,

166
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,800
and why I think he made such
an incredible connection with people

167
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,160
is because he tells you
what's on his mind.

168
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,920
Why is it refreshing
to make false statements ?

169
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,240
I don't know that that is a false
statement and neither do you.

170
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,800
Yes, you do, because everyone
knows that statement was bullshit !

171
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Which is why it's alarming
that Pence would be willing

172
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,960
to defend a complete lie
by calling it "refreshing".

173
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,720
If that's the standard, you
can say all sorts of things.

174
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,120
Mike Pence spent $400 000 having his
penis replaced with marshmallow peep.

175
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,240
Is that true ? Who knows ?

176
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,680
But try telling me you're
not refreshed hearing about it.

177
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,760
Pence is well liked
among evangelical voters,

178
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,080
eight out of ten of whom
voted for the Trump-Pence ticket.

179
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,080
And he does have impeccable
credentials as a social conservative.

180
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,880
Pence used to have a local radio
show, "The Mike Pence Show",

181
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,040
where he sounded off
on hot button issues.

182
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,040
While current Pence is controlled
and polished, back then,

183
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,920
he was surprisingly animated.

184
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,000
Listen to him address one topic,
with some contempt in his voice.

185
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,800
Early in the week we talked
about whether or not it was time

186
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,120
to rethink this whole business
of women in the military.

187
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:24,120
What the fuck is that tone ?
He's saying "women in the military"

188
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,960
with the same skepticism you'd use
to describe this whole business

189
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,960
of "dinosaurs in medical school"

190
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,680
or "Cher in the starting lineup
for the Cavaliers".

191
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,240
She's a bench player at best
you restrict her minutes.

192
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,720
He wasn't just being provocative
there, he means it.

193
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,920
Pence wrote an editorial attacking
the Disney film "Mulan"

194
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,600
for showing a woman in combat:
"women in military, bad idea".

195
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,600
And if you're thinking:
"He grew up in the 1950s,"

196
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,480
"it's just a generational thing",
no, he didn't.

197
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,880
He's 58 years old.

198
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,200
Pence is three months "younger"
than Flavor fucking Flav.

199
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,120
He has no excuse there.

200
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,280
That is one of many ludicrous opinions
Pence has expressed over the years.

201
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,040
He also argued for the teaching
of intelligent design in schools,

202
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,840
he expressed a hope to consign
Roe v. Wade to the ash-heap of history

203
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,080
and responded to an HIV outbreak
among drug users

204
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,560
by dragging his feet on
allowing needle-exchange programs,

205
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,120
"he was going to go home
and pray on it."

206
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,080
I realize this isn't
the most relevant criticism here,

207
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,080
but can't you do that
from the office ?

208
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:47,080
The issue Pence is most associated
with is his hostility to LGBT rights.

209
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,840
It is not just me,
his boss seems to think so, too.

210
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,760
The New Yorker reports that behind
closed doors Trump had a habit

211
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,680
of mocking
Mike Pence's religiosity.

212
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,280
When the conversation
turned to gay rights,

213
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,680
Trump joked: "Don't ask that
guy, he wants to hang them all."

214
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,760
Trump is clearly joking about that.
But it is also the kind of punch line

215
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,400
that only works if we all know
the premise behind it to be true.

216
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,520
Like jokes about terrible
airline food, or bad break-ups,

217
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,040
or how people from Toronto
are terrified of hard-boiled eggs.

218
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,200
They're jokes based on universal
knowledge we all agree on.

219
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,880
Pence is not, and has never been,
a friend of the gay community.

220
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:38,200
He's fought anti-discrimination laws,
opposed allowing gays in the military,

221
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,720
with his campaign's website saying:

222
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,280
"Homosexuality is incompatible
with military service"

223
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,240
and he once defended
the "sanctity of marriage"

224
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,760
in another passionate speech.

225
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,360
Marriage was ordained by God,
is the glue of the American family

226
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,400
and the safest harbor to raise
children and it must be defended

227
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,600
against the onslaught
of the Left in the Congress,

228
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,360
in the courts, and if need be in
the Constitution of the USA.

229
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,160
Holy shit. If I may quote one
of America's greatest philosophers.

230
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,960
Jesus ain't say that.

231
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,600
She's absolutely right.
He didn't say it.

232
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:29,160
Pence made national news signing
a "Religious Freedom Restoration Act",

233
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,440
which enabled businesses to
discriminate on the basis of sexuality.

234
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:39,680
Angie and her wife Cynthia believe
it's an invitation to discriminate.

235
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,960
We don't know what restaurants
or stores we can go into

236
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,640
and not be turned away
and have to suffer.

237
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
That's degrading.

238
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,840
People were afraid of being
turned away from restaurants.

239
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,320
It is bad for someone to privately
dislike you for your sexuality,

240
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,880
but it's worse to be publicly
told you are too gay for waffles.

241
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,960
When this possibility was raised
to Pence by George Stephanopoulos,

242
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,600
he refused
to engage in the question.

243
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,960
So yes or no. If a florist in Indiana
refuses to serve a gay couple

244
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,560
at their wedding,
is that legal now in Indiana ?

245
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,960
This is where this debate has gone
with misinformation...

246
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,120
It's just a question, sir.
Yes or no ?

247
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,640
There's been shameless rhetoric
about my state and about this law

248
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,160
all over the Internet.

249
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,760
It should be legal in Indiana
to discriminate against gays ?

250
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,800
It's a yes or no question !

251
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,160
Hoosiers don't believe
in discrimination.

252
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,000
But that's neither the word "yes"
nor the word "no."

253
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,680
It's the word "Hoosier,"

254
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,000
which isn't an answer
to "any" question besides:

255
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,280
"what's a good derogatory slang term
for an owl with a drinking problem ?"

256
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,120
Look at yourself,
you Hoosier.

257
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,400
You gonna go fly into a fucking tree.
Get your life together !

258
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,480
Fucking Hoosier.

259
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,040
But while Hoosiers may
not believe in discrimination,

260
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,960
Mike Pence clearly does.

261
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,760
One specific allegation
he's pushed back on

262
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,440
concerns whether or not
he supported gay conversion therapy.

263
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,880
A question that
didn't come out of nowhere.

264
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,560
When Pence ran for Congress
in Indiana in the 1990s,

265
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,920
his campaign agenda included this:

266
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,600
"resources should be directed
towards those institutions"

267
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,880
"which provide assistance to those
seeking to change sexual behavior."

268
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,560
Mr. Pence did not and does
not support gay conversion therapy.

269
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,440
While I personally
find that denial horseshit,

270
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,280
I will acknowledge
the language on his website

271
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,360
was very carefully worded,
it does give him an escape.

272
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,240
His denial is an effort to reverse
a decision made in the early 'aughts,

273
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,400
apart from Russell Crowe's
upcoming "divorce auction",

274
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,400
to settle his 2003 marriage.

275
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,800
It is called "Russell Crowe:
The Art Of Divorce."

276
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,720
It's real, and it's amazing,
and you can buy items

277
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,400
such as this leather jockstrap used
during the filming of "Cinderella Man".

278
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,760
Will we be stupid enough
to bid on that ? I don't know.

279
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,840
Why don't you ask one
of our five wax presidents ?

280
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:34,640
But the point here is: Pence denies
supporting conversion therapy.

281
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,920
Hard to take,

282
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,080
considering how much he praised
someone closely associated with it.

283
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,120
One of his mentors is the notorious
homophobe James Dobson.

284
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,200
I'll let him introduce himself
in a truly unsettling way.

285
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,080
I represent an organization
called Focus On The Family,

286
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,080
which a 3-year-old one time
called "poke us in the fanny".

287
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:03,280
That's not far off from what
we're trying to do in some ways.

288
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,200
We're thrusting ourselves into
the hole of American spiritual life

289
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,640
and reaching around to grab
the tent poles of secular decadence.

290
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,160
That's what Focus On The Family
is all about: having gay sex.

291
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,800
Reducing the rate of gay sex
by at least half !

292
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,280
The organization Dobson founded,

293
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,520
has a history of promoting
conversion therapy.

294
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,120
For a decade, it sponsored

295
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,480
a "conference addressing, understanding
and preventing homosexuality"

296
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,000
called "Love Won Out",

297
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,520
which could not sound any more
like a euphemism for masturbating.

298
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,600
This talk of being poked in the fanny
makes me want to go and love won out.

299
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,080
Dobson also wrote a book
titled "Marriage Under Fire",

300
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,960
in which he stated:
"Focus On The Family promotes"

301
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,640
"the truth that homosexuality
is preventable and treatable."

302
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,720
And he produced a video series
in which he elaborated.

303
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:08,480
We wanna talk about the prevention
and treatment of homosexuality in boys.

304
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,840
There are more than a thousand
who are being treated

305
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,600
at any given time for homosexuality.

306
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,280
They don't all change,
it's not easy to change,

307
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,200
I don't want to imply that
it's just a simple thing,

308
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,360
you just decide you're not gonna
be homosexual anymore.

309
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,480
There are deeply rooted factors
that account for this

310
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,960
and they are tough to whip.

311
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,000
There is no such thing
as the "homosexual agenda",

312
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,560
but if there were "whipping bad
boys by the thousands"

313
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,800
wouldn't "not" be on it.

314
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,720
Dobson left Focus On The Family
in 2010

315
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,200
and they have since claimed
they softened their message.

316
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,880
If you go to their website now,
you will find articles like

317
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,160
"When A Loved One Says I'm Gay:
The Stages Of Grief"

318
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,160
and why we support
"sexual orientation change efforts".

319
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,120
Their logo still features a child
who dismembered her parents

320
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,280
and is holding their severed arms
aloft in some impish victory dance.

321
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,480
And I think that's just sick !

322
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,040
While Pence may claim he did not
and does not support gay conversion,

323
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,520
he supports those who support it.

324
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,280
Last year,
he was in Colorado saying this.

325
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,720
It is great to be here on the 40th
Anniversary of Focus On The Family.

326
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,360
Allow me to acknowledge
the founder of this ministry,

327
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,240
a man who became the author
of an enormous body of work

328
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,040
that inspired millions, and he's been
a friend and a mentor to me...

329
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,800
Dr. James Dobson.

330
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,720
Saying you don't support therapy,
and then calling Dobson your mentor

331
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,280
is like saying you're a vegetarian
and a law abiding citizen

332
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,200
and by the way, "please meet my
friend and mentor 'The Hamburglar.'"

333
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:08,040
Pence is not saying that as a radio
host or an Indiana congressman.

334
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,360
He's saying it
as Vice President of the US.

335
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,400
In which role he also presented Dobson
with an award just last June.

336
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,880
All this makes it even more galling
that, at the start of this piece,

337
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,520
I promised that I would mention
one thing I liked about Pence.

338
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,200
A promise is a promise.
So, through gritted teeth, here it is:

339
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,560
I kind of like his rabbit.

340
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,000
I really genuinely do.
I'm not the only one.

341
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,880
Vice President and his wife
could kiss

342
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,120
their audience's attention goodbye
once Marlon Bundo was introduced.

343
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,000
The Pences have a pet rabbit
and his name is Marlon Bundo.

344
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,600
Which again, is an objectively
good name for a bunny.

345
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,720
Marlon Bundo is a great rabbit.
He has his own Instagram account.

346
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,200
Here he is making an important
phone call,

347
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,560
here he is making another one,
this time using a landline.

348
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,480
Here he is posing next
to a strangely appropriate sign:

349
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,400
"if you met my family
you would understand."

350
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,760
Here's the thing, Marlon.
I haven't. Yet I still do.

351
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,040
Marlon Bundo is the most likable thing
about an otherwise unlikable man.

352
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,280
Like how George W. Bush
is a perfectly fine painter

353
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,280
or how Bill Cosby raised
awareness of pudding,

354
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,080
or how Roger Ailes is dead.

355
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,360
Sometimes you can't deny that there's
one thing you like about someone.

356
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,720
Bundo is about to get
even more attention.

357
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,600
The first tell-all book to come
out of the current White House...

358
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,240
Marlon Bundo is signing a deal
to publish

359
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,440
Marlon Bundo's "A Day In The Life
Of The Vice President."

360
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,720
Marlon Bundo has a children's
book coming out. This is it.

361
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,920
It's being released tomorrow.
There's even going to be a book tour !

362
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,360
I would love to say: "Fine,
it's a sweet book about a rabbit."

363
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,600
Who gives a shit ?

364
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,880
One of the stops on that book tour
is at Focus On The Family.

365
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,080
Congratulations, Pence: you even
managed to ruin Marlon Bundo.

366
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,240
Now none of us can enjoy
a book about your rabbit.

367
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,800
Or can we ?

368
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,440
Because it turns out,
in a complete coincidence,

369
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,000
we also wrote a book
about Mike Pence's rabbit

370
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,280
that has also been published.

371
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,560
While his is out tomorrow,

372
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,200
ours is released right now.

373
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,800
There are a few small differences
between the two books.

374
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,160
You'll notice right away
that our rabbit has a bow tie.

375
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,760
Our story is about Marlon Bundo
falling in love with other boy rabbit.

376
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,280
Because our Marlon Bundo is gay.
Just like the real Marlon Bundo.

377
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,440
You can buy this book,
starting right now at Amazon.

378
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,000
And at BetterBundoBook.com.

379
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,520
Which should be easy
enough to remember.

380
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,040
Do you want the regular Bundo book ?
Or the better Bundo book ?

381
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,960
It's at BetterBundoBook.com.

382
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,240
All of our proceeds from this
are going to The Trevor Project,

383
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,240
which provides crisis intervention
and suicide prevention services

384
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:28,560
to LGBTQ youth and AIDS United,
which works to end the AIDS epidemic.

385
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:35,000
Selling more books than Pence
will piss him off.

386
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,520
That's three
great reasons right there.

387
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,880
You can also buy an audiobook
at Audible.com,

388
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,360
featuring Jim Parsons,
Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Jeff Garlin,

389
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,480
Ellie Kemper, John Lithgow,
Jack McBrayer and RuPaul.

390
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:54,280
This is actually a book for children.
This is a real children's book.

391
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,920
This isn't some adult book telling
Mike Pence to go fuck himself,

392
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,520
although in buying it,
that's what you would be doing.

393
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,080
This is a sweet story about
Marlon Bundo falling in love.

394
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,280
And to prove it,
here is just a taste.

395
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,080
Hello, my name is
Marlon Bundo and I am a bunny.

396
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,760
This is the story
of my very special day.

397
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,960
As usual after breakfast, I hop
to the garden to look at the flowers.

398
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:28,240
That is when I saw him. The most
beautiful bunny I had ever seen.

399
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,440
"My name is Marlon," I said,
"but my family calls me BOTUS".

400
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,640
It's short for bunny of the US.
It's a long story.

401
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,640
My name is Wesley
and my family calls me Wesley.

402
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,080
Said Wesley.
We went on a long hop together.

403
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,600
We hopped through the garden,
right inside the old stuffy house.

404
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,120
We hopped through very boring
meets with boring people.

405
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,720
At the end of our hop I said:

406
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,400
"Wesley I don't want to hop
without you ever again."

407
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,400
And Wesley said...

408
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,280
That's funny because I never
want to hop without you, Marlon Bundo.

409
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,080
And we both said...

410
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,240
We will get married
and hop together forever.

411
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,760
- Wait !
- Said the Stink Bug.

412
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,000
You can't get married.

413
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,400
The stinkbug was in charge.

414
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,640
All the animals listened to him
even though he was very stinky.

415
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:34,560
Boy bunnies don't marry boy bunnies.
Boy bunnies have to marry girl bunnies.

416
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,600
But don't worry.
We had a plan.

417
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,800
A plan that involved
all the animals in the garden.

418
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,360
If you want to know how the story
turns out, buy the book.

419
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,040
Buy it for your children.
Buy it for any child you know.

420
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,280
Or just buy it because you know
it would annoy Mike Pence.

421
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,640
You'd be doing a nice thing
in a really dickish way.

422
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,880
You can find it
at BetterBundoBook.com or

423
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,320
at the website FocusOnTheFurmily,
which we also own now.

424
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,120
If you'd prefer to donate to The
Trevor Project or AIDS United,

425
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,480
if you make a donation
of $11.99 or more,

426
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,680
you can get a free copy
of the e-book.

427
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,720
We've actually bought copies for
every member of our audience.

428
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:32,000
That is our show ! Go online
or to bookstores next week.

429
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,080
I'll be talking about all of this
on Ellen and Seth Meyers.

430
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,200
Thank you for watching.
Please buy a book. Good night !

431
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

432
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,360
END OF EPISODE 5,
SEASON V
