00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,960
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,360
SEASON V
EPISODE 28

3
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,280
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,080
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,040
A quick recap of the week,
which has been dominated

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,000
by the run-up to
this Tuesday's midterm elections,

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,600
which promise either joy
or disappointment.

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,440
Like hearing this music
coming up the street.

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,160
It might be an ice cream truck,
it might be that weird guy

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,040
who only plays calliope covers
of "Turkey in the Straw".

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,960
It could very much
still go either way.

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,400
Trump made his final argument
to his base, veering off message,

13
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,720
like when he brought up
Republicans lose the House.

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:09,000
It could happen. We're doing
very well in the Senate.

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,080
But could happen. And
you know what you do ?

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,640
My whole life,
you know what I say ?

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,080
"Don't worry about it, I'll just
figure it out." Does that make sense ?

18
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,600
That does actually
kind of make sense !

19
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,760
Trump has failed upward
for 72 straight years,

20
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,280
why should he stop now ?

21
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,840
At the Pearly Gates,

22
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,400
there's a non-zero chance
that he'll get in,

23
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,320
marry three hot angels
and be elected the next God.

24
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,120
This campaign, at every level, has
been exceptional for its negativity.

25
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,760
Take California Congressman
Duncan Hunter,

26
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,480
who gained notoriety for
vaping in a Congressional hearing,

27
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,440
which is exactly what you'd
expect a congressman

28
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,160
named "Duncan Hunter" to do.

29
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,080
Hunter went negative during campaign
in an attack ad against his opponent.

30
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,440
Ammar Campa-Najjar
is working to infiltrate Congress.

31
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,520
He used three names
to hide family's ties to terrorism.

32
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,520
His grandfather masterminded
the Munich massacre.

33
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,520
He is supported by CAIR
and the Muslim Brotherhood.

34
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,080
This is a well-orchestrated plan.

35
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,400
Ammar Campa-Najjar,
a risk we can't ignore.

36
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,840
A lot to unpack there,
let's start with the fact

37
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,480
that you are arguing this guy
changed his name

38
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,720
so that Americans wouldn't associate
him with terrorism

39
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,840
and landed
on "Ammar Campa-Najjar" ?

40
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,440
You'd have thought he might go
with something safer,

41
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,720
like "James Wonderbread"
or "Benjamin Americaface"

42
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,720
or something that plays to the
Islamophobic crowd, "Duncan Hunter".

43
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,520
I'm not gonna go through
everything untrue in that ad,

44
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,760
"Washington Post"
gave it a rating of four "Pinocchios",

45
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,720
although I'm surprised it didn't
get one Pinocchio

46
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,320
that hung itself with a note:

47
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,560
"I saw what your world
has to offer those who are different"

48
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,080
"and I no longer wish
to be a real boy in it."

49
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,080
It is hard to call Campa-Najjar
a security threat when he had

50
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,760
a security clearance for his past
work in the Obama White House.

51
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,960
Which is something that cloud chaser
probably couldn't get,

52
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,720
'cause he and his wife are under
indictment for illegally using

53
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,120
$250 000 of campaign funds
on personal expenses.

54
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,160
They have pled not guilty, but
the indictment itself is incredible,

55
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,480
Hunter spent $14 000
on a family vacation to Italy,

56
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:27,280
$462 for 30 shots of tequila and one
steak at a bachelor party,

57
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,320
$835 on Riverdance tickets

58
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,360
and $250 to fly a family pet,
a rabbit, to Washington D.C.

59
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,280
A $250 way to freak your
rabbit the fuck out.

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,600
It's a burrowing herbivore,

61
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,440
no part of it is jazzed to be
launched into the sky.

62
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,240
You think your ears pop ?
You don't know shit.

63
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,720
You don't know shit
about popping ears !

64
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,880
Things have also been
spicy in Iowa's Fourth,

65
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,000
where Steve King, who has a history
of flirting with white nationalists,

66
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,280
has gotten in hot water for
meeting with an Austrian party

67
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,680
founded by an S.S. officer.

68
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,960
When asked about that this week,
he did not take it well.

69
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,520
And this is over
if he keeps talking.

70
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,560
This is over
if you don't stop talking.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,600
I'm leaving if you don't...

72
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,920
I think he's given his answer.
His answer is his answer.

73
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,320
Stop it !

74
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,720
Stop it !

75
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,160
That is a spectacular whiff
when the question is simply

76
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,200
"Are you a white supremacist ?"

77
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,200
People who aren't white
supremacists say "no".

78
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,680
Even people who are white
supremacists know to say "no".

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,520
It takes a special mix of racism and
stupid to fuck that one up.

80
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,120
King lost a number of supporters,
including the corporate PACs

81
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,840
of Land O'Lakes, Purina,
and our parent company, AT&T.

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,560
King has been pretty much exactly
this racist for years now,

83
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,160
including once tweeting:

84
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,800
"Culture and demographics
are our destiny."

85
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,560
"We can't restore our civilization
with somebody else's babies."

86
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,440
Even neo-Nazi website
"Daily Stormer" has said:

87
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,400
"Steve King is basically an
open white nationalist at this point."

88
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,120
So the news really shouldn't be
"these companies bailed on him"

89
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,720
so much as: "they were okay with
him for a shockingly long time."

90
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,800
AT&T didn't catch on
to King's white nationalism.

91
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,000
Picking up on clear signals
isn't exactly their forte.

92
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,280
How do you like them apples,
business daddy ?

93
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,120
I'll bet you don't like
those apples, do you ?

94
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,280
All that toxicity makes you
grateful for the glorious silliness

95
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,120
of what happened in Nebraska's
first district.

96
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,000
A University of Nebraska professor
says he's been threatened

97
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,360
by Jeff Fortenberry's
campaign manager

98
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,760
after liking a picture on Facebook.

99
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,240
This is that picture.

100
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,160
Somebody put googly eyes
on Fortenberry's campaign sign

101
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,760
and changed it
to read "Jeff Fartenberry".

102
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,480
I don't know if Banksy's getting
better or worse. But he's changed.

103
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,760
Fartenberry was upset about this sign
and his chief of staff, Reyn Archer,

104
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,160
overreacted, to the point where
he called a local professor

105
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,240
named Ari Kohen, to complain,
because Kohen had liked that image.

106
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,880
Kohen recorded that call
and it's amazing.

107
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,960
- What you're liking is vandalism.
- No, it's not.

108
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,480
- Yes, it is.
- I'm liking a photo.

109
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,680
You're liking what
the photo represents is vandalism.

110
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,720
If someone were liking something with
blackface, would that be acceptable ?

111
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,280
Wait. I think I actually know
the answer to that question: no.

112
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,120
Blackface is not acceptable.

113
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,720
God, I just won !

114
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,680
I'm replacing Megyn Kelly
on the Today Show !

115
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,520
That's all it took ! What an
incredibly easy standard to meet !

116
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,400
Thank you so much,
personification of NBC !

117
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,680
Thank you so much.
It's lovely to see you.

118
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,840
What're you doing ?

119
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,000
Wait. No ! I'm not gonna
be that kind of Today Show host.

120
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,280
No, you've been through a lot,
haven't you ?

121
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,280
You've really been through a lot.
Just go home.

122
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,160
Just go home and you try
and get some rest.

123
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,840
It sounds rough over there.
Let me go.

124
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:22,680
The Peacock, ladies and gentlemen.
Tough place to work, historically.

125
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,920
Liking this sign is the same as liking
a photo involving blackface.

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,880
Signs like these come out
of a very racist tradition,

127
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,960
evoking offensive stereotypes
that all white people

128
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,400
have big googly eyes
and fart all the time.

129
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,440
Only some white people have
big googly eyes and fart all the time,

130
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,200
like Paul McFartney, Fartin Sheen,
Jimmy Farter, Melissa Joan Fart,

131
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,880
Dolly Farton, and, of course,
Fart.

132
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,840
But that's it. Those are
the only examples.

133
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,480
My favorite part of the call came
when Fortenfarty's chief of staff

134
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,640
tried to pressure the professor, by
threatening to take this to the public

135
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,000
and the professor
tried to dissuade him.

136
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,240
We have a First Amendment opportunity
to basically put you out there

137
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,440
in front of everybody and even
put this clearly as:

138
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,840
"why is a professor
liking vandalism ?"

139
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,840
We can do that publicly.
Would you like that ?

140
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,880
- That's our First Amendment right too.
- It'd be a terrible idea for you.

141
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,200
No. How so ?

142
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,720
Because the optics
of this are terrible.

143
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,040
Yes, they are.

144
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,200
If you are arguing it's wrong for
anyone to like "Jeff Fartenberry",

145
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't think you're gonna find
a groundswell of public support.

146
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,960
In an election season
featuring a vaping douche

147
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,080
and someone so racist
that butter had to weigh in,

148
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,160
this might be the best optics
you can possibly hope for.

149
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,680
And now this.

150
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,000
Our Annual Check-In
With The Consequences

151
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,120
Of Combining Local News Shows
And Halloween.

152
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,520
- Happy Halloween !
- Good morning !

153
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,680
Dracula runs on Dunkin.

154
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,600
With extra blood.
I can't drink it.

155
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,640
Happy Halloween !

156
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,560
Yes, it's turtle power,
all morning long here on BT.

157
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,880
Everybody wants to have the yard
and the garden. It's the envy.

158
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,400
I brought you a treat too.
A doggy treat.

159
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,680
We put these together on the cheap.
Because we do have a cheap budget.

160
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,360
Look at us. As Fred and Velma ?
Wilma ?

161
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,720
No, I'm Daphne.

162
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,280
- So cute in your bunny outfit.
- You made me wear it.

163
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,960
The scary credit card mistake
that most consumers make.

164
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,080
According to the National
Safety Council...

165
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,200
Children are more than twice
as likely to get hit by a car

166
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,720
on Halloween
than any other day of the year.

167
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,880
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns immigration,

168
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,720
the system that brought you me.

169
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,040
But it's still good and I promise
that won't happen again.

170
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,800
Immigration
has been dominating the news,

171
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,040
as migrants from Central America
continues to head north

172
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,640
and despite it being a thousand
miles and possibly months away,

173
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,680
Trump made it a centerpiece
of his closing argument.

174
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,960
At this very moment, large,
well-organized caravans of migrants

175
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,960
are marching
toward our southern border.

176
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,160
Some people call it an "invasion".
It's like an invasion.

177
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,520
A lot of young men, strong men.

178
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,960
A lot of men that maybe
we don't want in our country.

179
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,920
I don't want them in our country.

180
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,560
And women don't want them
in our country.

181
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,480
Women want security. Men don't
want them in our country.

182
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,400
But the women do not want them.
Women want security.

183
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,520
Young strong men are invading
and coming for our women.

184
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,520
That is such old-timey racism
I'm amazed that image

185
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,720
didn't automatically turn
black and white as he talked,

186
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,760
like "Pleasantville" in reverse.

187
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,000
Trump has been threatening
immigration actions ranging

188
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,960
from sending troops to the border,
to ending birthright citizenship.

189
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,120
Hard to know what the president
will or even can do.

190
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,200
Instead of hypotheticals,
it might be useful

191
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,040
to look backwards at something
he did do concerning immigrants:

192
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,440
family separation.

193
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,920
It was part
of his "zero tolerance" policy,

194
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,080
parents crossing border were locked up
and had their children taken away.

195
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,160
The story dominated the news
with distressing images

196
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,400
of kids in cages and shelters,
Melania's very cool jacket

197
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,120
reading: "I Really Don't Care, Do U ?"
and, of course, this moment.

198
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,600
I read today about a ten-year-old
girl with Down syndrome

199
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,320
who was taken from her mother
and put in a cage.

200
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,840
Did you say "womp-womp" to
a ten year old with Down syndrome ?

201
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,640
Yes, he did ! Corey Lewandowski
said "womp womp".

202
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,200
If there is any justice,
that will be carved on his gravestone

203
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,160
and when he arrives at
the Pearly Gates, he'll hear:

204
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,400
"Hi, Corey. I've been waiting
a long time to say this to you..."

205
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,080
After a national outcry
and court challenges,

206
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,840
the president signed
an order reversing course

207
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,480
and the story kind of faded
from the headlines.

208
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,120
It is worth revisiting, a number
of government reports came out,

209
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,960
giving us a clearer picture
of what was happening.

210
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,680
While it seemed malicious
and chaotic, at every step,

211
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,000
it was even worse
than you might assume.

212
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,240
So let's look at two major
aspects of family separation:

213
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,240
how it was done and why
and let's start with the how.

214
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,160
You remember stories of parents unsure
where their children had been taken.

215
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,160
When Alex Azar
was asked about this,

216
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,760
he reassured everyone that
there was nothing to worry about.

217
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,080
No reason why any parent would
not know where their child is located.

218
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:53,120
I sat on the ORR portal
with just basic keystrokes,

219
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,000
within seconds, could find any child
in our care for any parent.

220
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,560
It's not every day that you see
a man testify with the goal

221
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,320
of convincing people he has access
to a lot of kids on his computer.

222
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,000
Just a few taps on the ol' keyboard
and it's kid-city on this thing.

223
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,200
I open my computer,
I'm up to my neck in children.

224
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,200
I heard how that sounds
and you know what, I like it.

225
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,200
While Azar may've known
where the kids in his custody were,

226
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,320
that was
only one piece of the puzzle.

227
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,280
The critical information that allowed
kids to be matched with parents

228
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,760
was compiled by a different
department, Homeland Security,

229
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,640
their data was not just
incomplete and inconsistent,

230
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,480
but that each step of this process
was: "vulnerable to human error,"

231
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,040
"increasing the risk that
a child could be lost in the system."

232
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,800
You shouldn't be able to lose children
in a government system

233
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,600
as easily as in
a Chuck E. Cheese ball pit.

234
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,920
We're gonna have to call
off the search, Mrs. Donaldson.

235
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,920
Ralphie's lost to the balls, now.

236
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,520
While we've been told that the
government separated 2 600 children

237
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,480
and that about 220 kids are still
being held away from their parents,

238
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,760
we can't say for sure whether
those numbers are accurate.

239
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,120
Two weeks ago, the government
found 14 more children

240
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,320
and added them to its tally.

241
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,400
14 children were missing
and we didn't even know it.

242
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,560
How was that not a bigger story ?

243
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,840
When those 12 boys were stuck
in a cave in Thailand,

244
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,440
there were live cameras and Elon Musk
was sending submersibles

245
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,560
and calling rescuers "pedophiles".

246
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,920
I'm not saying that's what
I wanted to happen here.

247
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,920
But at least people were
fucking paying attention.

248
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,680
All this incompetence
should have been obvious.

249
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,200
When non-profits tried
to check on the kids,

250
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,480
the government didn't locate those
that were listed as being present.

251
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,400
We were given a list by the government
and we were told

252
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,800
we could choose
who we wanted to speak to.

253
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,280
Looking through the list
of over 500 names,

254
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,280
I noticed that there were
very young children there,

255
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,960
including a two year old,
several one year olds

256
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,480
and one child
that was listed as being zero.

257
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,000
I asked to see those children.
They left and came back

258
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,440
and said they couldn't
find the children.

259
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,240
"We called out their name
and nobody responded."

260
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,280
"So we don't know
where they are."

261
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,400
These are babies.

262
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,680
They're not gonna
respond to their name being called.

263
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,720
Anyone who calls a baby's name
and then gives up on finding them

264
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,200
either knows nothing about babies
or is covering for a baby

265
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,120
who doesn't
want to be reached.

266
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,080
Sorry, tell them I'm not in today.
I'm up to my diaper in triangles here

267
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,280
and I've got a 2:30 meeting
with my own toes to prep for.

268
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,560
Mondays, am I right ?
I don't know the days of the week.

269
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,880
I am, after all, a fucking baby.

270
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,400
Even with the help of nonprofits
in locating and reuniting parents

271
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,560
hundreds of whom were actually
deported without their children,

272
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
the government still had fuckups.

273
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,040
When one mother who'd had her
5-month-old baby taken away,

274
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,920
was later handed back
the wrong baby.

275
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,320
And just imagine thinking you're
about to be reunited with your child

276
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,440
and being given
someone else's shitty baby.

277
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,240
I say this as a parent:
my infant is a miracle and a joy.

278
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,960
Anyone else's is a charmless
snot-monster. Get it away from me.

279
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,080
To put it mildly, when it comes
to "how did we do this ?"

280
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,720
the answer is a combination of
"incompetently" and "cruelly".

281
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,920
Which brings us to the other
big question: Why did we do this ?

282
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,440
Some in the Trump administration
argue they had no choice.

283
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,280
Are you intending for this
to play out as it is playing out ?

284
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,280
For parents to be separated from
their children ? To send a message ?

285
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,960
I find that offensive.
No.

286
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,960
Why would I ever create a policy
that purposely does that ?

287
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,960
- Perhaps as a deterrent.
- No.

288
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,320
No ! A deterrent ?
I would never ! You offend me, sir.

289
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,000
About this administration: you've
figured out what they're doing

290
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,640
when they get offended by your
description of what they might do.

291
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,960
It's like a poker player ejaculating
every time they have a good hand.

292
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,040
We all see
what's happening here.

293
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,560
The official line was that family
separations were not a deterrent,

294
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,320
but a consequence of having
to enforce the law,

295
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,680
as the then acting head of ICE,
Thomas Homan, explained.

296
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,040
Every law enforcement agency

297
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,880
separates parents from children
when they're arrested for a crime.

298
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,480
We are enforcing
the criminal laws.

299
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,680
I don't blame anybody for
wanting to be in the greatest country,

300
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,360
but there's a right way to do it
and a wrong way.

301
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,840
It's hard to listen to someone say
"we're the greatest country",

302
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,600
while justifying why we're
ripping kids away from their parents,

303
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,880
especially when that person looks
like what would happen

304
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,640
if a can of Monster Energy
fucked John Lithgow.

305
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,320
A few things there regarding
the "right way".

306
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,960
Many of these people
were applying for asylum,

307
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,160
meaning they're seeking
protection from persecution.

308
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,680
Under international and U.S. law,
it is legal to apply for that

309
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,880
no matter
how you enter the country.

310
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,400
While the Trump administration
insisted that the "right way"

311
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,240
for asylum seekers to come in
was through official border crossing,

312
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,400
they made it more difficult
to do that,

313
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,680
with many being repeatedly
denied entry into the country

314
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,240
and forced to wait days
or even weeks.

315
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,120
You can't arbitrarily delay people
that long, they're looking for safety,

316
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,640
not AT&T customers
trying to speak to a representative.

317
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,120
That's right, I've got you,
business daddy !

318
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,760
What are you gonna do about ?
I'm right here !

319
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,440
Crossing the border
in "the wrong way"

320
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,560
is only a misdemeanor
on first offense.

321
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,920
Most people are usually
just sentenced to time served.

322
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,880
Contrary to what you might think,

323
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,920
most of the parents who were separated
from their kids were charged,

324
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,480
pled guilty, and served
their sentence, all fairly quickly.

325
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,600
In the past, we didn't prosecute
parents and let many of them go free

326
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,840
awaiting their immigration
hearing, which makes sense.

327
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,760
Why did we suddenly start keeping
people who had served their time

328
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,560
away from their kids ?

329
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,320
Trump hated the old system.
He called it "catch and release"

330
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,240
and he described it
in wildly misleading terms.

331
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,480
We catch a criminal, a real
criminal, a rough, tough criminal,

332
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,920
we take his name
and then we release him.

333
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,800
We say please show up to court
in a couple of months.

334
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,000
You know what the chances of getting
him to court are ? Like zero, okay ?

335
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,080
When Trump said
the number "zero",

336
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,480
you knew no matter what the number
was, it was definitely not zero !

337
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,040
If he says something's hot, it's cold.
If he says something's up, it's down.

338
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,200
If "this is a cute puppy",
you'd think:

339
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,000
"I'm not sure why or how, but that
puppy is definitely an asshole."

340
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,400
When it comes to families
seeking asylum,

341
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,040
who were the ones largely
impacted by family separation,

342
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,840
the number is far from zero.

343
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,640
96 percent of them turned up to court
after being released from detention.

344
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,040
Under an Obama program called
"family case management"

345
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,120
where each family was assigned
a case manager,

346
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,520
99.3 percent
attended their hearing.

347
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,440
So Trump was wrong.
He was 99.3 percent wrong !

348
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,400
And you know what
that means: we got him !

349
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,400
We got him !

350
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:39,320
You're probably expecting the tiger
to come out now, but sadly,

351
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,760
he died of sadness
several months ago so,

352
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,880
all this button now does
is increase my morphine drip.

353
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,880
It numbs the pain. It's not
perfect but it helps. See you later.

354
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,640
Trump discontinued that program,

355
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,360
despite the fact that even ICE
called it "an overall success"

356
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,200
and went with ripping apart
families instead.

357
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,120
So, for the final time: why ?

358
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,800
If they'd paid
the price for their crime

359
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,280
and there were better ways to ensure
they showed up for court,

360
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,840
why the everlasting fuck
did we really do this ?

361
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,640
I would argue that this is the logical
result of a general hard-right turn

362
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,920
toward demonizing immigrants
for political advantage,

363
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,840
in a way that some might call "racist"
and others would be wrong about.

364
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,040
Conservative immigration arguments
follow a pretty clear pattern.

365
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,080
Crossing the border is a crime,
anyone crossing it is a criminal.

366
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,440
Since all criminals are dangerous,

367
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,480
anyone crossing the border
is a dangerous criminal.

368
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,360
Immigrants are less likely to commit
crimes than people born here,

369
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,520
that has simply not stopped
Republicans from running

370
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,880
anti-immigrant, anti-caravan
political ads like these.

371
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,120
A woman gunned down by an
immigrant who should've been deported.

372
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,040
Illegal aliens invade America.

373
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,880
Democrats who stand in our way

374
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,400
will be complicit in every murder
committed by immigrants.

375
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,160
Mexican drug lords. MS-13 gang
members. Sex traffickers.

376
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,920
MS-13. Violent gang members.
People from the Middle East.

377
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,800
That's racist, they gave up any
pretense of specific fear-mongering

378
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,480
and simply said
"people from the Middle East".

379
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,760
Why not go all-in and start
naming groups you hate ?

380
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,560
The caravan also contains
Planned Parenthood,

381
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,200
gays who want wedding cakes,
black Santa

382
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,520
and a thirty-foot Nancy Pelosi.

383
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,080
Democrats will be complicit in every
person the giant Pelosi eats.

384
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,560
If you watch enough
of those ads, you realize

385
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,800
it's not they don't want immigrants
to come here because they're criminals,

386
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,120
it's that they're calling them criminals
because they don't want them here.

387
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,960
Watch this exchange that CNN had
with a New Jersey Trump supporter.

388
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,840
So you're worried
about immigration ?

389
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,280
Only coming in the illegal way.

390
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,440
Come in the legal way and
you are more than welcome.

391
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,840
It is legal to seek asylum.

392
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,800
I hope Trump changes that.

393
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,680
- You don't want any asylum seekers ?
- No.

394
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,760
Not often you see someone's cover
story fall apart with little pushing.

395
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,160
Are you three kids
wearing a trench coat ? No.

396
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,840
Do you want some ice cream ?

397
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,800
Yes, there are three of us
and we all like chocolate.

398
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,400
We're now so accustomed
to seeing immigrants as a threat

399
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,280
that politicians routinely talk
about them in the language of war.

400
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,960
Trump referred to the caravan
as an "invasion"

401
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,760
and sent troops to the border.

402
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,760
That kind of militaristic talk
can make people think

403
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,840
it is necessary to make the kind of
impossible choices made during a war,

404
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,840
which is how things
like family separation happen.

405
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,520
Just watch as Jessica Vaughn
tries to justify what we did.

406
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,440
A lot of Americans find it appalling.
What do you say to them ?

407
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,360
It's appalling
that we have to do it.

408
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,960
What do you think the consequences
are for these children

409
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,800
that have gone through, that
are still going through, this trauma ?

410
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,640
It's very possible that some
will have some lasting effects.

411
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,160
Right, but lasting damage
to children is a huge consequence.

412
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,800
You're separating them
from their parents,

413
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,680
not telling them you ate their candy
to get on Jimmy fucking Kimmel.

414
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,280
While we're on that topic:
no one should do that.

415
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,120
I'm really glad that some people do,
'cause it's extremely funny.

416
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,640
But nobody should.
But please keep doing it.

417
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,960
While she acknowledges that
what we're doing is appalling,

418
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,840
she says "we have to do it".

419
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,880
But the truth is, we don't
have to do any of it.

420
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,000
Even though the language of war
is being used, there is not a war.

421
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,800
The reason people keep
talking like there is one

422
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,400
is permission to make the choices
they want to be forced to make.

423
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,120
Family separation
cannot be one of them.

424
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,920
As she says: "these kids
will have some lasting effects".

425
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,960
While that's easy to say in the
context of abstract pediatric science,

426
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,320
the reality of it is heartbreaking.

427
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,360
Take Jenri, he's a six-year-old
from Honduras.

428
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,720
Separated from his mother
and reunited after a month apart.

429
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,040
As a documentary crew found,
their ordeal was far from over

430
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,320
and this is going
to be rough to watch.

431
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,040
... need to take care of you.
I think I need to leave, okay ?

432
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,440
I want to go to the jail.

433
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,240
- You want to go there ?
- You don't love me.

434
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,600
Who told you I don't love you ?

435
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,800
You're not my mom anymore.

436
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,160
Jenri ?

437
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,840
This separation was so long,
my son has changed so much.

438
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,560
With so much trauma.

439
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,560
"I don't want to be your son,
I'm not your son anymore", he said.

440
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,200
Yeah. We did that.

441
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,640
Not because we had to,
but because we chose to.

442
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,280
We may actually
be about to do it again.

443
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,600
Trump has publicly flirted with
bringing back family separation

444
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,440
and Homan supported that idea
during an interview with Fox & Friends

445
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,960
or, as it's known, "a face to face
meeting with the president."

446
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,560
Zero tolerance policy, that was
the right thing to do.

447
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,400
Regardless of how sad it is, no one
wants to see families separated,

448
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,720
but when they separated those
people that were prosecuted

449
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,400
the numbers went down
22 percent in two weeks.

450
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,600
If they would have stuck with that
there wouldn't be a caravan today.

451
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,640
Yeah, maybe, Tom !

452
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,280
If we surrounded the border
with randomly firing flamethrowers

453
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,360
and snakes trained to stand up
when anyone approached,

454
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,560
that could drive
the caravan away too,

455
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,280
but we don't do things like that,
it's not supposed to be who we are.

456
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,640
I say that fully and painfully aware

457
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,120
that if Trump hears that idea
coming out of a television,

458
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,320
he may well go: "someone write that
down, snakes and flamethrowers."

459
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,200
"I had it. That's my idea."

460
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,680
If the president wants to make Tuesday
election about him and immigration,

461
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,640
then fine,
let's make it about that.

462
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,920
Family separation is perhaps
the most emblematic moment

463
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,880
of his presidency so far:
it was cruel, sloppy, needless,

464
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,520
racist, and, ultimately, exactly
what we should have expected.

465
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,160
The biggest threat to our status
as "the greatest nation on earth"

466
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,600
is not a caravan
a thousand miles south of us,

467
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,720
it's whoever thinks that doing this
is an acceptable response.

468
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,320
And now this.

469
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,840
Halloween Part II:
Just The Traffic And Weather.

470
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,920
Yeezy in the house !
Yeah. Making America Great Again.

471
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,080
Let's get you your forecast,
show you what's happening.

472
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,760
On the east end, there is a
possibility for more showers.

473
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:26,880
These rain showers associated with
a cold front get in here Friday.

474
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:32,640
We do have precipitation south,
moving in parallel to the mountains.

475
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,040
You can see some precipitation
popping up across Eastern Oregon.

476
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,920
We're hanging in for the stormy
cycle in November.

477
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,920
Let's go to traffic with Debbie !

478
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,000
We're gonna start off in those
high forties to mid-fifties.

479
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,240
The rain chance keeps elevating.

480
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,280
Temperatures dipping
into the forties.

481
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,560
We have a wreck on the Belk Freeway
and that's the look of traffic.

482
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,120
Didn't think
that through all the way.

483
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,440
That's our show. Thanks for watching.
See you next week, goodnight.

484
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,400
Thank you, NBC Peacock.
Thank you, very nice.

485
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,400
I know.
It sounds terrible.

486
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:22,720
I can't imagine how difficult
it was for you.

487
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,840
There we go. It's all right.
