I'VE BEEN AWARE OF COLDPLAY FOR

PEOPLE WERE AWARE OF IT, BUT

1095
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:47,691
PEOPLE WERE AWARE OF IT, BUT
THERE WAS NO CONSENSUS ON, WHAT

1096
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:53,130
THERE WAS NO CONSENSUS ON, WHAT
SHOULD WE DO ABOUT IT?

SHOULD WE DO ABOUT IT?

THE GUYS, OR YOU CAN CHANGE THE

CULTURE, AND IF WE FIX THE GUYS
AND FIX THE CULTURE, WE WON'T

1102

AND SO FAR, MUCH OF THE APPROACH

1105
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,912
AND SO FAR, MUCH OF THE APPROACH
THAT WE HAVE HAD IS TO PUT ALL

1106

THAT WE HAVE HAD IS TO PUT ALL
OF THE BURDEN ON WOMEN.

OF THE BURDEN ON WOMEN.

SOME OF THE MORE DISINGENUOUS
QUESTIONS OUT THERE?

1147
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:14,444
QUESTIONS OUT THERE?
ONE OF THE REFRAINS YOU

1148
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:15,012
ONE OF THE REFRAINS YOU
HEAR A LOT IS, "WHERE IS THE

HEAR A LOT IS, "WHERE IS THE
LINE?"

BUT IT SEEMS THAT IS OFTEN IN

1152
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:20,350
SEARCH OF A ANSWER THAT WILL
IDENTIFY EXACTLY HOW CLOSE TO

00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:21,218
IDENTIFY EXACTLY HOW CLOSE TO
THE LINE THEY CAN POSSIBLY GET.

1154
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,986
THE LINE THEY CAN POSSIBLY GET.
SO IF AN 8-SECOND HUG IS

1155
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:28,892
SO IF AN 8-SECOND HUG IS
UNACCEPTABLE, GREAT, I'M DOING A

1156
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:29,893
UNACCEPTABLE, GREAT, I'M DOING A
7 1/2-SECOND HUG AND I'M

TO THAT, YOU KNOW, IT WAS BAD,

1162
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,503
TO THAT, YOU KNOW, IT WAS BAD,
BUT IT WASN'T QUITE BAD ENOUGH.

1163
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:42,973
BUT IT WASN'T QUITE BAD ENOUGH.
IT WAS A 7 1/2-SECOND HUG.

00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:43,807
IT WAS A 7 1/2-SECOND HUG.

REALIZE THEY WERE GETTING CLOSE

1168

TO THE 8 SECONDS BECAUSE THEY'RE

1169

NOT GOOD WITH NUMBERS.

SO IT HAS TO BE WITH THE LAW.

00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:06,063
SO IT HAS TO BE WITH THE LAW.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SO OFTEN

1172
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:06,930
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SO OFTEN
HAPPENS IS THAT THE LAW AROUND

1173
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:07,931
HAPPENS IS THAT THE LAW AROUND
DISCRIMINATION RELIES ON INTENT.

1174
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:09,032
DISCRIMINATION RELIES ON INTENT.
DID THEY INTEND TO HARM YOU?

DID THEY INTEND TO HARM YOU?
WELL, IF YOU'RE A VICTIM, IT

00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:11,668
WELL, IF YOU'RE A VICTIM, IT
DOESN'T MATTER SO MUCH WHETHER

1177
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,836
DOESN'T MATTER SO MUCH WHETHER
THEY INTENDED.

1178
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:14,204
THEY INTENDED.

AND THAT MEANS THAT THERE ARE

1183
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,745
AND THAT MEANS THAT THERE ARE
REPERCUSSIONS AND CONSEQUENCES

1184

REPERCUSSIONS AND CONSEQUENCES
REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOUR INTENT

1196
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:40,831
>> YEAH.
IF YOU ARE A HARASSER, YOU

1197
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:42,065
IF YOU ARE A HARASSER, YOU
SHOULD BE TERRIFIED, AND YOU

1198
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,133
SHOULD BE TERRIFIED, AND YOU
SHOULD NOT DO THAT.

1199
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:45,602
SHOULD NOT DO THAT.
THE WHOLE IDEA OF FALSE CLAIMS

1200
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:47,170
THE WHOLE IDEA OF FALSE CLAIMS
IS SOMETHING THAT IS ANOTHER ONE

IS SOMETHING THAT IS ANOTHER ONE
OF THOSE ROADBLOCKS THAT PEOPLE

OF THOSE ROADBLOCKS THAT PEOPLE
THROW UP.

1203

THROW UP.
WELL, THAT REALLY HASN'T

WELL, THAT REALLY HASN'T
MANIFESTED ITSELF.

1205

THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT NEVER

THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT NEVER

THAT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE
DON'T NEED TO MAKE RULES AROUND

1209

DON'T NEED TO MAKE RULES AROUND
THE THINGS THAT RARELY HAPPEN

SO LET'S GO BACK TO 1991.
YOU WERE CALLED TO APPEAR BEFORE

1236
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:48,765
YOU WERE CALLED TO APPEAR BEFORE
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE,

1237
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:49,399
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE,
AND IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAD A SET

1238
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:49,967
AND IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAD A SET
OF EXPECTATIONS OF HOW THAT

1239
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:50,934
OF EXPECTATIONS OF HOW THAT
WOULD GO, AND THOSE EXPECTATIONS

1240
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:52,970
WOULD GO, AND THOSE EXPECTATIONS
WERE, IN A VERY REAL SENSE, NOT

1241
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:54,705
WERE, IN A VERY REAL SENSE, NOT
MET.

1242
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:56,039
MET.
WAS THERE A POINT DURING THOSE

1243
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:56,873
WAS THERE A POINT DURING THOSE
EIGHT HOURS THAT YOU WERE KIND

1244
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:57,541
EIGHT HOURS THAT YOU WERE KIND
OF THINKING TO YOURSELF,

1245
00:32:57,543 --> 00:32:58,408
OF THINKING TO YOURSELF,
"REALLY?

1246
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,309
"REALLY?
THIS IS WHAT TODAY IS GOING TO

1247
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:02,713
THIS IS WHAT TODAY IS GOING TO
BE?"

1248
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:04,214

WHAT PROCEDURE WOULD YOU LIKE TO

00:33:08,754 --> 00:33:09,086
BE PUT IN PLACE?"
I'M A WITNESS.

00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:09,920
I'M A WITNESS.
I'M ON THE WITNESS STAND.

1254
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:11,455
I'M ON THE WITNESS STAND.
I'M TRYING TO TESTIFY.

1255
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:13,724
I'M TRYING TO TESTIFY.
AND I THOUGHT, "THEY REALLY

1256
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:18,328
AND I THOUGHT, "THEY REALLY
DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING."

1257
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,963
DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING."
>> John: IT'S AMAZING.

1258
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:20,697
>> John: IT'S AMAZING.

RESTRAINT DURING THAT
DAY, BUT THERE ARE STILL MOMENTS

00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,568
DAY, BUT THERE ARE STILL MOMENTS
WHERE IT FEELS LIKE YOU CAN

JUSTIFIED.

1278
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:58,201
JUSTIFIED.
>> ANY OF THE REACTIONS THAT I

HAVE NOW IS SORT OF HINDSIGHT.

1280
00:33:58,804 --> 00:33:59,403
HAVE NOW IS SORT OF HINDSIGHT.
I FELT LIKE I WAS ENTITLED TO.

1281
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:00,003
I FELT LIKE I WAS ENTITLED TO.
I WILL ADD THAT IN TERMS OF MY

I WILL ADD THAT IN TERMS OF MY
DISPLAY OF CONTEMPT, YOU KNOW, I

HAVE LIVED THROUGH A LOT OF

HAVE LIVED THROUGH A LOT OF
CHALLENGES, AND HAVING QUESTIONS

1285
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:22,492
CHALLENGES, AND HAVING QUESTIONS
THROWN AT ME TO CHALLENGE MY

THROWN AT ME TO CHALLENGE MY
COMPETENCY AS A WOMAN, AS A

1287
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:27,030
COMPETENCY AS A WOMAN, AS A
WOMAN OF COLOR.

1288
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:29,199
WOMAN OF COLOR.
AND SO MUCH OF WHAT I HEARD THAT

00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:29,733
AND SO MUCH OF WHAT I HEARD THAT
DAY WAS FAMILIAR IN TONE.

1290
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:30,333
DAY WAS FAMILIAR IN TONE.
THE QUESTIONS WERE DIFFERENT,

1291
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:31,334
THE QUESTIONS WERE DIFFERENT,
BUT THE TONE WAS REALLY

1292
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:32,002

FAMILIAR.

NOW, OF COMING FORWARD TO GET

00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:35,972
NOW, OF COMING FORWARD TO GET
RICH AND FAMOUS.

1298
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:36,673
RICH AND FAMOUS.
HOW DID THAT WORK OUT FOR YOU?

1299
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:37,541
HOW DID THAT WORK OUT FOR YOU?
>> WELL, SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY

1300
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:39,209
>> WELL, SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY
THAT I AM INFAMOUS, SO IT

1301
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:41,678
THAT I AM INFAMOUS, SO IT
CERTAINLY WORKED IN THAT WAY,

1302
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,612
CERTAINLY WORKED IN THAT WAY,
BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT I EVER

BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT I EVER
WANTED TO BE FAMOUS OR RICH, I

WANTED TO BE FAMOUS OR RICH, I
HAD A PLAN FOR DOING THAT THAT

00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:49,453
HAD A PLAN FOR DOING THAT THAT
WOULD NOT HAVE INVOLVED THE HURT

1306
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:52,055
WOULD NOT HAVE INVOLVED THE HURT
AND HARM THAT WAS DONE, NOT ONLY

1307
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:55,692
AND HARM THAT WAS DONE, NOT ONLY
TO MYSELF, BUT CERTAINLY TO MY

1308
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:56,526
TO MYSELF, BUT CERTAINLY TO MY
FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND THE

HISTORICALLY, WHENEVER

00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,673
LIKE WE THINK ABOUT IT JUST LONG
ENOUGH TO FEEL LIKE WE'VE

1317
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:10,941
ENOUGH TO FEEL LIKE WE'VE
ADDRESSED IT BUT NOT QUITE LONG

1318
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:13,310
ADDRESSED IT BUT NOT QUITE LONG
ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS IT.

1319
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:14,678
ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS IT.
WHAT ARE THE WAYS THAT WE CAN

00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,613
WHAT ARE THE WAYS THAT WE CAN
TACKLE THE PROBLEM OF WORKPLACE

1321
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,815
TACKLE THE PROBLEM OF WORKPLACE
HARASSMENT?

1322
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:20,684
HARASSMENT?

PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, WE ARE SERIOUS
ABOUT IT, IS TO PUBLICIZE THE

1327
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:30,327
ABOUT IT, IS TO PUBLICIZE THE
POLICIES AND TO INFORM PEOPLE,

1328
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:32,696
POLICIES AND TO INFORM PEOPLE,
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU FILE

THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU FILE
A COMPLAINT.

A COMPLAINT.
HERE ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU

HERE IS THE PROCESS.

HERE IS THE PROCESS.
I ALSO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME

1336
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:44,241
I ALSO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME
MANAGEMENT THINGS THAT WE CAN

1337
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:46,309
MANAGEMENT THINGS THAT WE CAN
DO.

1338
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:51,114
DO.
WE, FOR EXAMPLE, CAN DO BY

1339
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:56,119
WE, FOR EXAMPLE, CAN DO BY
BYSTANDER TRAINING, BECAUSE I

1340
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:57,053
BYSTANDER TRAINING, BECAUSE I
THINK THERE'S PEOPLE THAT

1341
00:35:57,055 --> 00:35:57,787
THINK THERE'S PEOPLE THAT
ARE SAYING, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

1342
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:58,355
ARE SAYING, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO
DO.

1343
00:35:58,357 --> 00:35:59,156
DO.
>> John: I THINK OF MYSELF IN

1344
00:35:59,158 --> 00:35:59,823

00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:00,590
THE WORKPLACE OVER THE YEARS,
AND I CAN'T HONESTLY SAY THAT I

00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:01,625
AND I CAN'T HONESTLY SAY THAT I
CONSISTENTLY SPOKE UP IF I SAW

1347
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:06,763
CONSISTENTLY SPOKE UP IF I SAW
CREEPY BEHAVIOR, ESPECIALLY WHEN

1348
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:07,464
CREEPY BEHAVIOR, ESPECIALLY WHEN
I WAS MUCH YOUNGER AND I FELT

1349
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:10,100
I WAS MUCH YOUNGER AND I FELT
THAT I WAS ON THE LOWER END OF A

POWER DYNAMIC AND DIDN'T
NECESSARILY FEEL EMPOWERED TO

NECESSARILY FEEL EMPOWERED TO
SPEAK OUT AND SAY, "THAT'S

SPEAK OUT AND SAY, "THAT'S
WRONG."

1354
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:20,277
WRONG."
THAT'S A PRETTY POOR EXCUSE, BUT

1355
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:20,944
THAT'S A PRETTY POOR EXCUSE, BUT
IT'S PROBABLY HOW I FELT AT THE

IT'S PROBABLY HOW I FELT AT THE
TIME.

1357
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:22,445
TIME.
HOW SHOULD I FEEL ABOUT MYSELF

1358
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:23,213
HOW SHOULD I FEEL ABOUT MYSELF
LOOKING BACK OTHER THAN SLIGHTLY

1359

LOOKING BACK OTHER THAN SLIGHTLY
ASHAMED?

1364
00:36:29,488 --> 00:36:31,354
TO PUT IT.
ACTUAL SHAME WOULD BE, AT THE

ACTUAL SHAME WOULD BE, AT THE
VERY LEAST, THE DESTINATION

VERY LEAST, THE DESTINATION
YOU WOULD AIM FOR.

SOMETIMES SHAME IS NOT HELPFUL.

SOMETIMES SHAME IS NOT HELPFUL.
IT JUST MAKES PEOPLE FEEL GUILTY

1370
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:43,233
IT JUST MAKES PEOPLE FEEL GUILTY
AND MAYBE EVEN RESENTFUL.

AND MAYBE EVEN RESENTFUL.
SO WE -- YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO
