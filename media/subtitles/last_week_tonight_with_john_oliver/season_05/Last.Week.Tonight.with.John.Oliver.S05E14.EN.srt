00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,800
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,400
SEASON V
EPISODE 14

3
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,600
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,160
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,920
A quick recap of the week. We begin
with the upcoming North Korea Summit.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,720
If you are wondering
how hard Trump has been preparing,

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,120
deep down,
you know the answer.

8
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,280
I'm very well prepared. I don't
think I have to prepare very much.

9
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,400
It's about attitude, it's about
willingness to get things done.

10
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,680
"It's not about preparation,
it's about attitude."

11
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,800
That's not a viable strategy
on RuPaul's Drag Race,

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,960
where you'd better also bring your
knowledge of wigs, makeup,

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,240
fashion and tucking technique
or you sashay away.

14
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,520
Trump is confident. When he was asked
how soon he would know

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,120
if talks were going well,
this was his reply.

16
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,520
I think within the first minute,
I'll know.

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,920
My touch, my feel.
That's what I do.

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,360
It's not a great sign for a negotiation

19
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,160
where so much depends on tone
and choice of words.

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,920
He's describing his strategy in
the most upsetting possible way.

21
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,080
I'm gonna grope
my way through this.

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,160
Or I was gonna use our mouths to bring
this summit to a satisfying climax.

23
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,400
Why's everyone's
looking at me weird ?

24
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,320
We still have
two days until the Summit,

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,160
so that's two more sunsets
at least for us to enjoy.

26
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,320
Let's move on to the Philippines.
The southeast Asian island,

27
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,600
not the teenage fan club
for Prince Philip.

28
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,000
He's so dreamy.
It's his birthday today.

29
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,480
We've talked
before about their president,

30
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,480
strongman and aspiring Street Fighter 2
character Rodrigo Duterte,

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,480
who's gained notoriety
for supporting extrajudicial killings

32
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,160
as part of his war on drugs.

33
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,720
He demonstrated the same level
of nuance to gender relations.

34
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,360
A kiss may just be a kiss sometimes.

35
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,600
But not when the Philippine
President is delivering it.

36
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,880
A spokesman for Rodrigo Duterte
says the president's kiss of a woman

37
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,120
was an act of endearment
toward Filipino workers.

38
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,800
"It was an act of endearment
towards Filipino workers"

39
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,480
is a more creative justification
for that sort of behavior than:

40
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,800
"when you're a star,
they let you do it."

41
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,560
That clip didn't do justice

42
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,240
to how uncomfortable
the build-up to that kiss was.

43
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,000
That felt so grotesque,
the MTV Movie Awards

44
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,280
have retroactively nullified
every "Best Kiss" winner, saying:

45
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,800
"Given Duterte's recent actions, we can
no longer condone kissing of any kind."

46
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,320
"Every kiss
is now the worst kiss."

47
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,560
Many in the Philippines were
upset by this,

48
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,280
but Duterte's legal counsel insisted
the incident was charming.

49
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,920
The kiss was an endearing kiss.
Coming from a fan

50
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,480
who was so tickled pink when
she had the opportunity.

51
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,640
She did it willingly and excitedly,
she was tickled pink !

52
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,200
Stop saying "tickled pink".
It's not technically a dirty phrase,

53
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,400
but you are making it
disgusting.

54
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,840
Fan or not,
she repeatedly pulled away from him.

55
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,400
Sometimes women
just don't want to kiss you.

56
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,280
I'm not speaking from
personal experience here,

57
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,040
I just have a deep rooted hunch
about it.

58
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,080
This incident is the tip of the iceberg
regarding Duterte and sexual politics.

59
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,800
In February,
he told a group of Filipino workers:

60
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,640
"Don't use condoms
because they don't feel good",

61
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,040
which is not great advice
in a country facing an HIV epidemic.

62
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,040
He gave a group of soldiers
a horrifying suggestion

63
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,000
for how to deal with female rebels.

64
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,320
Tell the soldiers, the women,
call them and tell them:

65
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,040
"the mayor has a new order
not to kill you,"

66
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,880
"just shoot you
in the vagina".

67
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,280
No more vagina,
you're useless.

68
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,280
Let's be clear about this one:
"without a vagina, you're useless"

69
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,560
it's a searing indictment of anyone
who's stuck walking around

70
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,720
with this ridiculous thing instead.

71
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,680
Look at it.
Does anybody find this cool ?

72
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,000
There's not a single person
in this room thinking;

73
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,920
"what a spiffy little gizmo
we're all gazing upon !"

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,800
"I hope he keeps that
image on the screen forever !"

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,360
As for the outcry
over his kissing stunt,

76
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,640
Duterte claimed
it was all perfectly innocent.

77
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:21,600
I can only generate an emotion
if I kiss a woman I love.

78
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,680
Any other stranger is pure showbiz.

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,800
Pure showbiz.

80
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,440
You want
to say that that's a terrible excuse,

81
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,120
but given all we've learned
about the entertainment industry,

82
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,120
"pure showbiz" might be the perfect
description of what is happening.

83
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,120
And now, this.

84
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,560
Julie Chen has a few questions for
the audience of "The Talk".

85
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,960
How awkward would it be
at this point in your life,

86
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,960
for your parents
to see you naked ?

87
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,040
What is the last object
you got hit by ?

88
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,040
At what age do you think
it's ok to scare a child ?

89
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,600
Do you plan for the end ?
Do rats freak you out ?

90
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,840
Do you think
you could do your job stoned ?

91
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,400
Have you ever had
to toot your own horn ?

92
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,680
Would you trust
a robot to cook your food ?

93
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,840
Has anyone ever interrupted
you in the bathroom ?

94
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,360
Do you think
claiming your pet peacock

95
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,320
as your emotional support animal
is going too far ?

96
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,480
No, Julie.

97
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,920
Moving on. We thought we'd update
you on the ongoing scandals

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,680
that we've been calling
"Stupid Watergate".

99
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,280
A scandal on the scale of Watergate,
but where everyone involved

100
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,800
is dumb and terrible
and bad at everything.

101
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,800
Last month marked the one-year
anniversary of Mueller investigation.

102
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,720
Or as the president
call itÃ½

103
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,040
Robert Mueller's illegitimate,
runaway witch-hunt.

104
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,360
- It has been a witch-hunt.
- This is a witch-hunt.

105
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,160
- This is a witch-hunt.
- Basically a witch-hunt.

106
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,680
- The witch-hunt.
- It's a damn witch-hunt.

107
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,600
They've been referring to the Mueller
investigation as a "witch-hunt".

108
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,960
Which is a little ironic,
if Giuliani, Hannity and Trump

109
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,680
had been alive
back when people burned witches,

110
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,920
they'd have had front-row seats,
toasting marshmallows,

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,800
trying to conceal their boners.

112
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,160
It's also a strange claim,
considering that Mueller's team

113
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,880
has charged 20 people
and three companies

114
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,960
and gathered five guilty pleas.

115
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,080
If this is a witch-hunt,
witches exist.

116
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,680
We should change references
in our history books

117
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,960
to 16th-century witch hunts
to read:

118
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,880
"That Time We Were Right To Murder
All Those Teenage Girls in a Lake."

119
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,760
And the fact the investigation
has been moving fast is good news,

120
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,320
set aside how you feel
about Trump or politics.

121
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,280
"Did a hostile foreign government
try to manipulate our election ?"

122
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,080
is something any reasonable person
should want answered quickly.

123
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,240
An increasing number of Americans
seem to want the investigation to stop.

124
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,920
Last July, support for investigation
stood at 62 percent,

125
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,320
but a recent poll found it's now
down to just 54 percent.

126
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,600
Trump has actually considered
shutting the investigation down before.

127
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,920
If that number keeps dropping,
he may well feel empowered to do it.

128
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,040
Let's talk about
the Mueller investigation.

129
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,600
Not about its contents because
we don't know what they are yet.

130
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,040
About the effort
to actively undermine it,

131
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,920
not just from Trump and his lawyers,
but from, and more importantly,

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,520
Trump's TV friends, specifically
Pumpkin Dad, Captain Virgin,

133
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,960
Bad Judge, Whiter Megyn Kelly,

134
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,000
The Dunce Bus,
The Dunce Bus Junior for Presidents,

135
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,280
and Michael Cohen Client Number
Three, Sean Hannity,

136
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,160
a man voted most fuckable by "Nana
Needs New Glasses" magazine.

137
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,040
And if you're thinking:
"I don't watch Fox News."

138
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,600
It's important you know what's been
happening on it, for reasons that,

139
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,120
and I cannot believe I'm saying this,
Rudy Giuliani explained best.

140
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,920
When he was asked why he was
spouting unsubstantiated nonsense,

141
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,760
he offered this explanation.

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,520
Eventually the decision here
is gonna be impeach, not impeach.

143
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,680
Members of Congress are gonna be
informed by their constituents.

144
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,720
So our jury, as it should be,
is the American people.

145
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,280
He's right. He's related, by blood,
to his first wife. But he is right.

146
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,600
It is the longstanding view
of the Justice Department

147
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,440
that you cannot indict
a sitting president.

148
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,400
So to the extent that Trump
can be held accountable,

149
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,080
it's gonna be through impeachment,
where public opinion is key.

150
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,880
When Giuliani goes on TV, he's
arguing to the jury. And that is us.

151
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,320
I know you're thinking:
"fuck, jury duty !"

152
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,320
"Time to act like a racist idiot
to get out of it !"

153
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,920
That is not a disqualifier this time.
Not by a long shot.

154
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,720
Let's look at a few techniques they've
been using to influence public opinion.

155
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,360
The first involves attempting
to redefine the investigation.

156
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,400
Whenever they discuss it,
it's inevitably framed like this.

157
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,240
Mueller is there to show collusion
between Russia and Trump.

158
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,400
There is none so far
so why not end it ?

159
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,480
Where is any evidence of collusion ?
Show us. Nothing so far.

160
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,080
There is zero evidence
of Russia collusion.

161
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,960
Four words. Conclusion.
Collusion ? No.

162
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,960
Illusion, delusion, yes. I thought
we'd have some fun with words.

163
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,760
We didn't have fun
with words there.

164
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,680
All we did was witness the closest
anyone in the Trump administration

165
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,240
has ever come to making
or hearing rap music.

166
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,640
Mueller wasn't tasked with finding
"proof of collusion",

167
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,160
the word collusion doesn't
appear in his appointment letter.

168
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,240
He was tasked with looking
into links and coordination

169
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,640
between the Russian government
and the Trump campaign,

170
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,360
as well as "any matters that arose or
may arise from the investigation."

171
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,800
Saying the investigation has to shut
down if there's no collusion

172
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,760
is like Scrabble has to end because
you fit all the letters in your mouth.

173
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,200
Congratulations, but those aren't
the rules that we agreed to.

174
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,840
That is far from
the only diversionary tactic here.

175
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,880
There's also Whataboutism.
We've talked about this,

176
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,640
the practice of shifting the debate
to someone else's wrongdoing.

177
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,600
The master of this is Sean Hannity,
and he responds to any negative news

178
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,520
about Trump with epic rounds
of the whatabout game.

179
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,080
We have a two-tiered justice system.
What about FBI director Comey ?

180
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,120
What about Bruce and Nellie Ohr ?
What about Strzok and Page ?

181
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,600
What about lying Susan Rice ?
What about Christopher Steele,

182
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,280
the foreign national
that Fusion GPS hired

183
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,480
and funneled the money Hillary
did through the law firm ?

184
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,720
And the foreign national got Russian
lies to influence the American people ?

185
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,080
Who lied to the FISA court judges ?

186
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,040
That is a lot of names to throw up
and say "what about them !"

187
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,520
It's also a little easy as an argument,
I'll prove it.

188
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,160
Sean, have you thought
about these 15 people ?

189
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,280
What about them ?
What about Archduke Ferdinand, Sean ?

190
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,040
What about Cher ?
We're not talking about the FBI

191
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,520
until you answer:
what about Cher, Sean ?

192
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,040
Hannity's point is that other people
did bad things,

193
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,360
so Trump's bad things don't count.

194
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,120
Whether or not someone else
did something shitty

195
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,760
has no bearing over whether
you did something shitty.

196
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,240
If that were true, every movie
that got a bad review could say:

197
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,360
what about
"From Justin To Kelly ?"

198
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,320
The critic would be legally required
to give their movie five stars.

199
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,600
That whataboutism is an important
part of the third tactic on display:

200
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,600
building a counternarrative.

201
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,120
Trying to delegitimize
the investigation,

202
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,720
by framing it as part of a grand
conspiracy to bring down Trump.

203
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,120
Hannity has Carrie-from-Homeland
is-off-her-meds conspiracy boards,

204
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,560
with Mueller and Clinton as the head
of two different crime families,

205
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,320
and whatever
is happening on this one.

206
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,520
Hannity paints a picture where the
investigation is one gigantic scandal,

207
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,560
with the Democrats, the FBI,
the "deep state",

208
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,160
and establishment Republicans
teaming up to take down Trump.

209
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,040
And he's got a favorite phrase
to convey its scope.

210
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,480
It's bigger than Watergate. Watergate's
like stealing a Snickers bar.

211
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,680
Makes Watergate look like
stealing a Snickers bar.

212
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,200
That's just an odd number
of mentions for Snickers,

213
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,200
considering it doesn't sponsor
Hannity's show.

214
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,800
Presumably, Snickers simply
couldn't hang with big hitters

215
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,720
like his actual advertisers,
My Pillow, RectiCare cream

216
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,760
and of course:
Sock Slider.

217
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,920
It's true, take a look !

218
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,960
You struggle, you strain,
you're so far away.

219
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,880
Just bending over to put on your socks
is brutally painful every day.

220
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,920
Not anymore !
Introducing Sock Slider !

221
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,080
The pain-free, no-bend-over way
to put on your socks every day.

222
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,160
Thank goodness.
I have been waiting for someone

223
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,280
to invent a gadget
that I can pre-load with a sock condom

224
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,120
and then foot fuck my way
to comfort every morning.

225
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:30,160
Hannity's narratives
tend to fall apart quickly.

226
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,800
Take two of the names
on his Family Feud board:

227
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,160
Peter Strzok and Lisa Page,
they are FBI agents who worked

228
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,120
on the investigations
into both Hillary and Trump.

229
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,640
And the key thing you learn,
if you follow conservative media,

230
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,080
is that they were making sex
at each other.

231
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,680
Did these two cheating lovebirds,
who were still married to other people,

232
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,400
have any opportunity
to do their jobs at the FBI ?

233
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,360
There she is,
FBI love bird Lisa Page.

234
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,120
Peter Strzok, and his in-office
fellow FBI agent,

235
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,560
and secret lover, Lisa Page.

236
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,800
Peter Strzok, who along with
his goomah Lisa Page,

237
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:14,680
are getting off in their fight to save
the country from Donald Trump.

238
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,240
They were fucking !
They were doing the nasty !

239
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,600
Doing the slam-bam in the ham.
Stuffin' the muffin.

240
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,960
They were poking them in 44
"and" piercing them in 52.

241
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:32,720
They were dining at the all-you
can-bone buffet at BJ O'Porkington's !

242
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,800
They were having an affair.
And in doing that,

243
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,240
they relied on FBI work phones
to hide it from one of their spouses,

244
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,360
which is bad judgment.

245
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,600
Plus, texts like these made it clear
they preferred a Hillary presidency.

246
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,120
A political opinion they're entitled to,
as long as it doesn't affect their work

247
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,600
and the DOJ is looking
into that question,

248
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,200
but Robert Mueller didn't wait.

249
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,120
He removed Strzok from investigation
when he learned about the texts

250
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,840
and Page had already left.

251
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,080
So these two haven't been part of this
investigation for nearly a year now.

252
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,560
"The Wall Street Journal" read
the 7 000 messages between them

253
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,800
and found no evidence
of a conspiracy against Trump.

254
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,960
Spare a thought for the reporter
who had to read 7 000 sexts

255
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,760
between two horny FBI agents.

256
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,120
That's not
why they got into the game.

257
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,000
Hannity still brings up Strzok
and Page all the time

258
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,120
as just two of the many threads
in this counternarrative.

259
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,160
His latest obsession
is something called "spygate",

260
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,040
the claim that the FBI planted
a "mole" in the Trump campaign.

261
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,640
Here is what the "spygate" story
is based on:

262
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,720
as part of the effort to investigate
Russia's meddling in the election,

263
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,000
FBI agents sent an informant
to talk to two Trump advisers

264
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,720
who had suspicious contacts
linked to Russia.

265
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,760
That is the whole thing. But here is
how bullshit their theory is:

266
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,960
Republican congressman,
Trey Gowdy,

267
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,240
who led a more than two year
inquiry into Benghazi,

268
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,200
no stranger to digging
for dirt on Hillary,

269
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,520
even he says this is nonsense.

270
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,760
You believe the FBI acted
properly in this matter ?

271
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,040
I don't know what the FBI could have
done or should have done

272
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,080
other than run out a lead that
someone loosely connected

273
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,640
with the campaign
was making assertions about Russia.

274
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,960
You would want the FBI to find out
whether or not there was any validity

275
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,960
to what those people were saying.

276
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,600
He's saying the FBI did what
they were supposed to do.

277
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,080
The headline
"FBI Investigates Possible Crime"

278
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,800
is like the headline
"Domino's Delivers Pizza"

279
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,600
or "Harley-Davidson Sells Mid-Life
Crisis Mobile To Local Dad".

280
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,160
That's their whole reason
for existence.

281
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,520
Rather than accept that pushback,
Trump supporters turned on Gowdy.

282
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,440
I'm naming names here,
I'm through with it.

283
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,800
Trey Gowdy is a schizophrenic.

284
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,080
He is absolutely in the service
of the establishment.

285
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,760
And the deep state, intentionally,
consciously or purposefully.

286
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,240
Anyone who questions the conspiracy,
becomes part of the conspiracy itself.

287
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,320
The only thing that is schizophrenic
about Trey Gowdy

288
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,320
is his hairstyle over the years.

289
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
What exactly
is happening here ?

290
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,680
Trey, my friend,
when you are born with bad hair,

291
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,120
just pick a look and stay with it,
I am an expert on this.

292
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,160
This machine is now running
so aggressively

293
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,400
that even evidence
can't slow it down.

294
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,000
Watch Hannity
actively admit it in real time.

295
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,000
No evidence
of Trump-Russia collusion.

296
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,240
Mueller, if you got it,
come on the show and tell America.

297
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,360
If you have more proof that this is
not a witch-hunt, I don't believe you.

298
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,920
Think about that. Give me facts and
even if you do, I won't believe them.

299
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,040
He is bragging
that he's proof-proof.

300
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,520
Which is a superpower
that no one should want to have,

301
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,160
like the ability to throw a baby
100 yards with a perfect spiral.

302
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,360
It's technically impressive,
but maybe don't do it.

303
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,200
And all this can make it easy to
forget how bad what we know already is.

304
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,600
We know that in 2016, Don, Jr.
set up a meeting in Trump Tower

305
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,000
with a person described to him
as a "Russian government attorney",

306
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,400
with the promise that the person
would provide information

307
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,040
that would "incriminate Hillary
and her dealings with Russia",

308
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,640
as part of "Russia and its government's
support for Mr. Trump".

309
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,000
We know not
because of the investigation

310
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,400
or because there was a spy
in the campaign,

311
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,840
or because these two fuck-buddies
teamed up to frame anyone.

312
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,600
Don Jr. tweeted out the e-mails
setting up the meeting.

313
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:01,400
So that story is just a fact,
one that looks very bad for Trump.

314
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,400
If you think Hannity isn't up to
the challenge of deflecting that one,

315
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,000
just watch him go to work.

316
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,840
Remember the infamous 2016
Trump Tower meeting

317
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,400
between Donald Trump Jr.,
a Russian lawyer,

318
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,000
a Russian American lobbyist
and few others ?

319
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,800
We have new information:
a transcript from a 2017 Senate hearing

320
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,200
that the Russian-American lobbyist
admitted to knowing Hillary Clinton.

321
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,680
Let me get this straight:
you seem to be implying Hillary Clinton

322
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,360
sent someone into Trump Tower,
to offer her opponent dirt on herself.

323
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,960
Congratulations, Sean Hannity,

324
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,760
you have officially come up with
the shittiest conspiracy theory.

325
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,040
None of this even addresses
the most obvious question.

326
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,040
If absolutely everyone,
from Hillary to the FBI to Trey Gowdy,

327
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,760
was in on a deep-state plan
to sabotage Trump,

328
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,360
how the fuck
is he president right now ?

329
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,520
Everyone in the country got together
to steal an election,

330
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,120
and then for some reason,
forgot to do it.

331
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,920
We could pick apart
conspiracies all night,

332
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,000
but there is really no point,
there'll always be another rabbit hole.

333
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,240
A metaphorical rabbit hole. Not
to be confused with The Rabbit Hole,

334
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,520
the gay club where, years ago,
a young Marlon Bundo allowed

335
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,640
his curiosity to overpower his shyness
and in so doing, met someone special:

336
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,280
himself.

337
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,400
Creating rabbit holes
is kind of the point here.

338
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,160
I would argue that Hannity,
Trump and all the rest

339
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,080
aren't interested in getting to
the bottom of any of these questions.

340
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,880
They're trying to sow enough doubt
that this number dips far enough

341
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,360
below 50 per cent to enable
the investigation to be shut down.

342
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,120
They are just working the jury.
If you've seen focus groups on TV,

343
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,320
you know that at least
some jurors are really listening.

344
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,400
I call it a farce,
created by the deep state.

345
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,000
It was a witch-hunt
to overturn an election.

346
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,520
All of this stuff
they say that Trump did,

347
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,920
they're finding out
the Democrats did.

348
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,200
It's been going on for a year
and a half.

349
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,160
We keep told: "There's something,
we'll find it." There's nothing.

350
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,120
Exactly. We've argued the tactics
you've seen are transparent,

351
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,920
illogical and dumb, but the other thing
they are is depressingly effective.

352
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,240
These tactics have worked in
the past. Quite famously, in fact.

353
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,080
A sociopathic misogynist millionaire,

354
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,000
evolved from celebrity
to undeserving folk-hero,

355
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,320
has evidence piling up
he may have done something terrible

356
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,440
and he puts
the whole system on trial.

357
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,120
If that sounds familiar,
it's the story of O.J. all over again.

358
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,800
Trump is going full O.J.
and it's working.

359
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,320
What does it mean
to "go full O.J. ?"

360
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,920
In one sense,
it means to murder two people.

361
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,640
But it also means,
to sway a jury by building a wild,

362
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,720
implausible conspiracy
that the system is corrupted.

363
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,120
Hannity throws out so many theories
is because he knows,

364
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,400
if he can discredit
any part of Mueller's investigation,

365
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,120
he can convince people
the whole thing is a sham.

366
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,120
And that is the same angle
that O.J.'s lawyers took.

367
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,000
Listen to one of them try
to discredit all evidence

368
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,800
because doubts raised
over a blood-soaked sock.

369
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,320
If they manufactured
evidence on the sock,

370
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
how can you trust
anything else ?

371
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,960
And the jury bought that !
I also do have questions

372
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,520
over how police got their hands
on those socks

373
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,520
because the Sock Slider
hadn't even been invented !

374
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:34,080
Seems impossible. There are
differences between the two defenses.

375
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,200
The O.J. trial had "if it doesn't fit,
you must acquit".

376
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,360
We have "collusion, delusion,
conclusion, illusion".

377
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,640
Which if anything is even dumber.
I am not saying Trump is guilty.

378
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,360
But even if the Mueller investigation

379
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,840
doesn't prove Trump colluded
with the Russians,

380
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,680
that doesn't mean the whole thing
was a witch-hunt or a waste of time.

381
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,720
The process of finding out
is important

382
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,520
and it needs to be seen
through to its conclusion.

383
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,760
And my fear right now is,
that we are headed in a direction

384
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,960
where even if Mueller comes
with irrefutable evidence,

385
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,840
Trump could pardon himself and
put out a book called "If I Did It"

386
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,200
and a large portion of the country
would fucking buy it.

387
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,040
And now this.

388
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:23,000
The entire seventeen-minute piece you
just saw, boiled down to eight seconds.

389
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,840
Time for our question of the day:

390
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,400
should the special counsel
now be shut down ?

391
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,720
Yes, shut it down.

392
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,760
Some news from the United Kingdom:
America's rough draft.

393
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:46,000
You may recall that last week,
we ran one of our "And Now" segments

394
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,480
featuring John Bercow,
delivering put-downs like this.

395
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:56,840
You are a boisterous fellow,
and in the course of your behavior,

396
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,240
you appear to be
chewing some sort of gum.

397
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,600
Whoever he is talking to
just got burned !

398
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,000
And by "burned" I mean
the British equivalent:

399
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,040
"boiled slowly over many hours until
devoid of all flavor and texture."

400
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,440
No one in the U.K.
saw that segment.

401
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,560
Not for disinterest, ignorance
about this show's existence

402
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,200
or longstanding aversion
to my name and face.

403
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,240
Even the people who watched
this show in Britain missed it.

404
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,040
Because where that segment
should've been, instead, they saw this.

405
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,680
Have I said too much ?

406
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,080
Our main story tonight
concerns senior citizens.

407
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,880
It just cut to black. Like I'd just
been murdered on The Sopranos.

408
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:52,160
In the U.K., it is, unbelievably,
against the law to use footage

409
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,080
from the House of Commons
for the purpose of comedy.

410
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,640
Specifically: "no extracts
of Parliamentary proceedings"

411
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,240
"may be used in any light entertainment
programme or political satire."

412
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,720
You're probably thinking:
lucky for you, your show is neither.

413
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,160
Well, fuck off, dad. I'm trying
my hardest ! Be proud of me !

414
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:21,880
This law was written after cameras were
introduced into Parliament, in 1989.

415
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,560
One of the MP's who wrote it
claimed that it was for good reason.

416
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:32,400
There is a tendency amongst
all journalists, that's how people are,

417
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,240
to tend to go for the startling
and in some cases the ridiculous.

418
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,440
We didn't want the situation where
if somebody's false teeth fell out,

419
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,000
that was the main thing that was
shown on TV.

420
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,640
That would not be the "main" story
because this is the United Kingdom:

421
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,600
"teeth disappoint" is not a headline,
it's a given.

422
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:01,320
Britain is supposed to be one of
the world's great free societies.

423
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,760
We came up with the Magna Carta
and we allow a product called

424
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,680
"Daddies brown sauce" to be sold
regardless of how disturbing it sounds.

425
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,920
That's freedom right there !

426
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,120
This anti-satire law isn't just
hypocritical, it is a burden.

427
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,120
It's hard to use Parliamentary footage
for purposes that are not comedy.

428
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,680
Parliament is inherently ridiculous.
Here is just a few seconds

429
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,440
of Bercow quieting one politician,
before introducing another.

430
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,800
They should pipe down,
and if they won't pipe down...

431
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:39,640
Very simply, three words: leave
the chamber. Mister Ed Balls !

432
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:45,160
Yes. You heard right.
"Mister Ed Balls !"

433
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,920
He is calling on this man
"Ed Balls", a former MP

434
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,160
legendary in Britain for once trying
to search for his own name on Twitter,

435
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,440
resulting in the magnificent tweet
by Ed Balls: "Ed Balls".

436
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:05,080
To not be able to make fun of
footage of that man is entrapment !

437
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,160
And the fact that we are using
Parliamentary footage

438
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,080
in making fun of this means
that this part of the show

439
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,960
is now going to be blacked out
in the U.K. tomorrow.

440
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,440
Which is genuinely insane
and frankly anti-Democratic.

441
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,400
This has to change.

442
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,480
So to drive home to U.K. viewers
what they're missing,

443
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,760
tonight's show is gonna end
in two ways.

444
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,800
In most of the world, they'll get
this segment you are watching now.

445
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,960
In the U.K.,
as a form of punishment,

446
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,760
this segment will be replaced
with Gilbert Gottfried reading

447
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:39,760
three-star Yelp reviews from
restaurants in Boise, Idaho.

448
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,520
La Tapia,
reviewed by L. S.

449
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,480
This was my first visit
because of a coupon.

450
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,760
The waiters were friendly and
it has a welcoming environment.

451
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,000
The food was ok.
If I didn't have a coupon,

452
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,520
I would give this restaurant
two and a half stars.

453
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,440
That is what Britain is getting
for five long minutes.

454
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,640
That is all the U.K. deserves,
until they change their law.

455
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,560
That's our show. Thanks for watching.
See you next week, good night !

456
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:23,520
Fork reviewed by Kelsey M.
Prepare to be underwhelmed !

457
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:30,040
We went here for Saturday brunch
after hearing from several sources

458
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,520
that it would blow our minds.

459
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,400
It was "meh" at best.

460
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:41,080
The food was lackluster
and the service was mediocre.

461
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,560
It was also disappointing to learn

462
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:51,160
that they don't offer any alternative
milk options for their coffee.

463
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,960
END OF EPISODE 14,
SEASON V
