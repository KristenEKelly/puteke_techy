00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,560
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,760
SEASON V
EPISODE 8

3
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,720
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,000
Thank you for joining us. We must
begin tonight with James Comey,

5
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,160
who sat down for an eye-catching
interview with ABC.

6
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,560
We haven't seen it yet,
we tape this show at seven o'clock,

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,760
but even just the clips this week
have been tantalizing.

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,600
I started telling him
about the allegation

9
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,560
was that he had been involved
with prostitutes in a hotel in Moscow

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,560
in 2013 during a visit
for the Miss Universe pageant

11
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,320
and that the Russians
had filmed the episode.

12
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,240
- How weird was that briefing ?
- Really weird.

13
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,200
Yeah, James Comey thought
that conversation was "really weird."

14
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,240
And that this is a man who has seen
Anthony Weiner's emails.

15
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,440
The Comey interview is the end of a
dramatic week that started with this.

16
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,720
Breaking news tonight !
FBI raids the office

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,800
of President Trump's
personal lawyer Michael Cohen.

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,640
It's true: the president's
personal lawyer got raided,

19
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,320
which has apparently left Trump
"pissed, flailing and upset,"

20
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,120
with "anger beyond
what anyone can imagine."

21
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,920
Which is saying something,

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,880
given that Trump's anger level
is somewhere between

23
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,680
"child who ate a pound of cocaine
throwing a tantrum in a K-Mart"

24
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,920
and Alec Baldwin after being told the
other party is finishing their dessert.

25
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,200
Cohen dominated the news particularly
when it emerged that Donald Trump

26
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,480
was not the only political figure
for whom he'd arranged hush money.

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,240
Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy
says Cohen negotiated a settlement,

28
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,240
reportedly worth 1.6 million dollars
with a former Playboy Playmate

29
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,960
who claims she became pregnant
as a result of a consensual affair.

30
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,440
Today Broidy resigned his post.

31
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,280
The deputy finance chair of the RNC,
cheated on his wife

32
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,160
with a former Playboy model,
and paid her off,

33
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,480
and has now resigned,
presumably so he can start his new job

34
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,200
as a big ol' bullfrog who sits
on a lily pad all the doo dah day.

35
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,200
Speaker of the House Paul Ryan
announced he wouldn't seek reelection,

36
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,680
Trump pardoned Scooter Libby,
and the National Enquirer

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,920
may've paid a doorman at Trump World
Tower to keep quiet about rumors

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,800
that Trump had fathered a secret child
with his housekeeper in '80s.

39
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,280
And on Friday night,
we bombed Syria.

40
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,840
There are those who would argue
that something had to be done

41
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,760
in response to Assad's
suspected chemical attack.

42
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,160
There are debates over whether Trump
had authorization to order the strikes,

43
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,720
and whether this risks drawing us
into a longer-term conflict

44
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,920
for which we have
no clear strategy.

45
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,520
But Trump has already declared,
"mission accomplished."

46
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Something even Ari Fleischer,
George W. Bush's Press Secretary,

47
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,240
responded to "I would have
recommended ending this tweet"

48
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,960
"with not those two words."

49
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,000
But this morning,
in a not-remotely-surprising turn,

50
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,080
Trump doubled down
on the phrase.

51
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,120
President Trump defended
the use of "mission accomplished."

52
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,080
"Syrian raid was carried out
with such precision"

53
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,080
"that the only way the fake
news media could demean"

54
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,080
"was by my use of the term
mission accomplished."

55
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,840
"It felt it is such a great military
term it should be brought back."

56
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,240
"Use often !" unquote.

57
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,720
It does not fill you with confidence
to have a president who announces,

58
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,840
"I know I'm repeating one of the most
notorious political blunders."

59
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,200
"Everyone should do it
and I'm gonna do it again forever."

60
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,120
If Trump's intention was
to descend so far into self parody

61
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,160
that he somehow
burrowed through the earth's crust

62
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,720
and came out the other side:
mission fucking accomplished.

63
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,840
And now, this !

64
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,760
Ari Melber, rap genius.

65
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,880
I don't know how much
hip-hop you listen to.

66
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,720
There's a famous song
"It's Going Down in the DM."

67
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,280
That refers to what happens
with direct messaging.

68
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,840
I don't know if you ever listened
to the rapper Kevin Gates who says,

69
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,600
"All my diamonds shining
'cause they're really diamonds."

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,240
Call it the Dr. Dre rule of politics.

71
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,160
When you diss Trump,
you diss yourself.

72
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,680
Lauryn Hill said,

73
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,000
"It ain't about what you cop,
it's about what you keep."

74
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,920
To paraphrase Kanye West you'll have
to wait for the 35th of Nevuary.

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,960
The thirty-fifth of Nevuary.

76
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,880
Kanye calls that
the thirty-fifth of Nevuary.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,480
We're gonna run out
of our Kanye references.

78
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,440
Here's how the rapper Drake
explains that lesson:

79
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,280
"Ya can't listen to me talk
and then tell my story."

80
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,240
"Ya can't listen to me talk
and go tell my story, nah."

81
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,040
"It don't work like that
when ya love somebody."

82
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,800
There's a saying in hip-hop

83
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,320
that can apply to Russian meddling:
can't stop, won't stop.

84
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,520
My view is:
I am heavy on the beat.

85
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,360
Didn't I, didn't I,
didn't I tell you that.

86
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,680
Word.

87
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,800
Moving on.
Our main story tonight involves taxes.

88
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,880
Essentially, the government's
GoFundMe page.

89
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,640
Today is April 15th,

90
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,920
which means you have
just 45 minutes to file your taxes.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Except relax, don't panic. Because
thanks to the weekend and a holiday,

92
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,760
the deadline
is actually April 17th this year.

93
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,880
Except don't relax, do panic, that's
still not enough time to do it right.

94
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,320
You're absolutely fucked
and you're going to jail, Anthony.

95
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,040
Many people are perplexed
and mystified by our tax system,

96
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,640
perhaps best exemplified
by this Instagram video from Cardi B.

97
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,920
The government is taking
forty percent of my taxes.

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Uncle Sam, I want to know what
you're doing with my fucking tax money.

99
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,000
What is y'all niggas doing
with my fucking money ?

100
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,360
What is y'all doing
with my fucking money ?

101
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,560
I want to know. I want receipts.
I want everything.

102
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:18,000
I want to know what is y'all niggas
doing with my fucking money ?

103
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,960
If you want to know
where your money's going,

104
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,320
may I present to you the recently
passed omnibus spending package !

105
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,120
It turns out your fuckin' money goes
to your fuckin' military, healthcare,

106
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,320
and your fuckin' social security and
veteran and unemployment benefits.

107
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,280
Everything else is some discretionary
shit and, of course, interest.

108
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,760
Now, as you may recall,
late last year, Republicans passed,

109
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,240
and Donald Trump signed,
a tax-reform bill.

110
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,600
Trump made some clear promises
about who stood to benefit.

111
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,440
Our focus is on helping the folks
who work in the mailrooms

112
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,600
and the machine shops of America.

113
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,680
The plumbers, the carpenters,
the cops, the teachers,

114
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,480
the truck drivers, the pipe fitters,
the people that like me best.

115
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,760
If this bill were really helping "the
people that like Donald Trump best,"

116
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,040
it would exclusively benefit
Eric Trump, Roseanne Barr,

117
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,360
and anyone who has ever looked
both ways before whispering:

118
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,720
"it was the Jews."

119
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,880
And, and the truth is,
for all Trump's talk of pipe-fitters,

120
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,960
the biggest tax rate cuts, by far,
actually goes to businesses,

121
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,000
with the top federal corporate tax
rate, the tax on a company's profits,

122
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,920
going from 35 percent
to just 21 percent.

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,680
And to be fair,
many policy makers, on both sides,

124
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,160
had argued
that the 35 percent federal rate

125
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,920
among the highest in the world,
should come down.

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,560
But: to be even fairer,
most companies didn't pay 35 percent.

127
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,800
In fact, before the bill was signed,
the "effective" rate,

128
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,320
the amount companies actually paid,
was closer to 24 percent.

129
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,160
And some large companies have
historically paid far less than that.

130
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,960
A few years ago,
people were furious about this.

131
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,040
G.E. had profits
of 14.2 billion dollars in 2010,

132
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,400
five billion dollars
of that made in the United States,

133
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,160
but the company's expected
U.S. tax bill ?

134
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,320
A grand total of zero dollars.

135
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,600
When the total is zero,
you can't call it a "grand total."

136
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,600
There is literally no total less grand,
except maybe Total cereal

137
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,160
and that's just because it tastes like
your spoon somehow missed the cereal

138
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,960
and now you're just
eating the box that it came in.

139
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,520
And, and G.E. may well say,
"Well, hold on that's just one year."

140
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,280
But, a recent study found that,
between 2008 and 2015,

141
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,400
18 large, profitable companies,
including General Electric,

142
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,720
paid no federal income tax
at all over the entire period.

143
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,640
None at all.
And that is a staggering total.

144
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,800
Which is what they used to call
"Total with Raisins,"

145
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,240
until they got more honest
and changed it to

146
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,720
"Total with Raisins
But Who Gives A Shit."

147
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,600
So tonight,
in honor of upcoming Tax Day,

148
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,200
we thought we'd give you a glimpse of
the lengths that companies will go to

149
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,040
to legally avoid taxes,
both here and abroad.

150
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,400
Corporate tax avoidance has a long
and infuriatingly proud history.

151
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,840
In the 1980s, for instance,
a lawyer named John Carroll, Jr.

152
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,000
came up with a tactic to move U.S.
companies offshore to avoid taxes,

153
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,960
and his firm celebrated him with,
and this is true,

154
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,560
a 13-minute operetta
staged in his New York apartment.

155
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,080
And I'll give you just a very
small taste.

156
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,560
The Feds will be screaming,
but you will be beaming

157
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,880
'cause we'll never pay taxes again.

158
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,040
We may have just found the only
musical resistant to race blind casting.

159
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,560
You can't go "Hamilton" on this one,

160
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,280
because those people really
have to be white.

161
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,080
Now, the tax dodge
being celebrated there

162
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,080
involved taking an American company
and headquartering it in Panama,

163
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,400
where taxes were lower,
"the Panama Scoot,"

164
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,040
which sounds like the name
of a tiny elf in a cowboy hat.

165
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,160
"Howdy. My name's Panama Scoot,
and I sleep in your boot !"

166
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,640
Offshore scooting is of a common
theme in corporate tax avoidance.

167
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,560
Companies have hunted for ways to get
their money to friendlier tax havens.

168
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,440
During the 2012 election,

169
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,240
it emerged that Mitt Romney had
money in companies in the Caymans,

170
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,360
which led to this magnificent clip
of John Stossel, saying the one thing

171
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,280
he probably shouldn't be saying
to the person he's speaking to.

172
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,520
Mitt Romney pays taxes on the money
earned from the Cayman entities.

173
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,560
I would think
it would be like pirate heaven.

174
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,200
Some pirate would go
and steal all the money.

175
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,600
Come on, Stossel !
Come on !

176
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,760
You can't say the word "pirate" to
a guy with an eye patch ! You can't !

177
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,280
It's like me sitting down across from
you and calling you "bootleg Geraldo."

178
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,880
Yes, it's obvious,
but it's also lazy and hurtful.

179
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,520
That's an indoor thought !

180
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,760
And, and tax havens have
become magnets to corporations,

181
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,160
who try and shift as much
of their profits there as possible.

182
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,160
It's a major reason why, in 2016,
nearly two-thirds

183
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,840
of the profits made by American
multinationals outside the U.S.

184
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,280
were booked in just six low
or zero-tax countries.

185
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,040
And it's a lot easier to move profits
offshore than you might think.

186
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,600
An increasingly popular way,
particularly pharmaceutical

187
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,920
and high tech companies like Google
avoid paying the thirty-five percent,

188
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,880
is to shift their patents,
computer code, pill formulas,

189
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:47,000
even logos from their U.S. bases
to their outpost in low tax countries.

190
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,200
Today, a company can move
all of its assets just on paper.

191
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,240
You then push a button
and move your algorithms...

192
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,760
Or Coca-Cola could
take their recipe out of the vaultý

193
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,480
- And put it in a Swiss vault.
- Then it's Swiss.

194
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,320
Yup. Coke could put their recipe
in a Swiss vault

195
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,640
and their profits
would move offshore.

196
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,840
That is very roughly how it works.

197
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,000
Just eing in a Swiss vault doesn't
automatically make something Swiss.

198
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,760
That's why we don't call this
"Swiss gold." We call it Nazi gold.

199
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,120
Those are Hitler bucks,
you Swiss fucks.

200
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,840
And this happens all the time,
and the best innovators

201
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,880
in weaselly accounting
have been tech companies.

202
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,000
Look at Apple.

203
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,000
For years, they've been deferring
paying U.S. taxes on foreign profits,

204
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,200
by stashing the money overseas
and not bringing it back.

205
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,560
At the end of last year,
they had $269 billion parked overseas.

206
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,080
When their CEO Tim Cook
appeared in front of Congress,

207
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,080
he was very defensive about that.

208
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,640
We pay all the taxes we owe
every single dollar.

209
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,960
We don't move
intellectual property offshore

210
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,880
and use it to sell our products back
to the United States to avoid taxes.

211
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,760
We don't stash money
on some Caribbean island.

212
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,920
He was technically correct there.

213
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,880
Because Apple didn't stash
their money on a "Caribbean" island.

214
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,640
They did, however, have it stashed
on this island, Ireland.

215
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,120
Which is, it is true,
not in the Caribbean.

216
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,040
So one word made
a lot of difference there.

217
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,440
It's like if somebody said,
"The one thing I can promise you"

218
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,840
"is that this refrigerator is not full
of severed Caribbean heads."

219
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,800
Maybe that is technically true,

220
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,560
but I'm still gonna pass
on the sparkling water.

221
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,680
When Ireland indicated
that it planned to change its tax laws,

222
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,920
Apple found a new shelter
for profits on this island,

223
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,480
the isle of Jersey,
a tax haven in the English Channel.

224
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,400
Which is, again,
not technically in the Caribbean.

225
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,120
Although, when you look at it,

226
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,760
you could almost mistake it
for the Caribbean

227
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,440
if you squint a little,
drink nine pints of beer,

228
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,240
and hold a picture
of the Caribbean in front of it.

229
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,720
Google used
a different tax workaround,

230
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,400
sending its money
on something of a world tour.

231
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,760
Google licensed some intellectual
property it created in the U.S.

232
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,840
to a subsidiary in Ireland.

233
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,160
But it turns out Google's overseas
profits don't even get taxed there

234
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,560
because Google then reportedly funnels
those profits through the Netherlands

235
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,640
and then to of all places, Bermuda
where the corporate tax rate is zero.

236
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,400
That tax trick has a name,
the Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich.

237
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,840
Sounds like a disgusting sex act

238
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,360
or an even more disgusting
Waffle House menu item.

239
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,680
It's when someone opens up
a baked potato, farts in it

240
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,800
and closes it again really quick,
that is exactly what it is.

241
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,640
When Google's CFO was asked
about their tax policies,

242
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,520
his answer nearly
got him laughed off the stage.

243
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,120
We pay all our taxes
in every jurisdiction

244
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,680
to the full extent
that the law allows us.

245
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,480
We pay every penny of tax we owe
to everybody, everywhere.

246
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,440
The reaction to "I pay all my taxes"
should never be incredulous laughter

247
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,600
unless you are a wealthy dog
who's just spoken for the first time.

248
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,320
I have some good news
and some bad news.

249
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,640
The good news is,
Trump's tax bill forces companies

250
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,320
to pay taxes on all the money
stashed overseas.

251
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,840
The hope is that they'll then
bring it home in "repatriation".

252
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,800
The bad news is, the tax they're
being forced to pay,

253
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,480
which may have once
been 35 percent, remember,

254
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,440
has been slashed to as
little as eight to 15 percent.

255
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,760
Seems less like a punishment

256
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,560
and more like rewarding
companies for tax avoidance.

257
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,960
But Steve Mnuchin, Treasury Secretary
and objectively good-looking man,

258
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,840
argued this would be a huge
benefit to America's workers.

259
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,680
We will have a one-time
tax on overseas profits,

260
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,720
which will bring back
trillions of dollars

261
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,960
that are offshore to be invested
here in the United States

262
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,040
to purchase capital
and to create jobs.

263
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,400
It was hard to pay attention
to what he was saying,

264
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,080
'cause you were automatically
undressing the guy with your eyes

265
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,480
and you do it whenever
he opens his mouth.

266
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,440
I'm definitely right. The guy's a
California ten. He's a smoke show.

267
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,560
What he's saying there is,
giving these companies a break

268
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,480
on the taxes they owe is worth it,
because it will lead to job creation.

269
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,440
Is hard to completely disprove,

270
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,800
because anything, theoretically,
could lead to jobs.

271
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,480
You can say "I'm dipping this
badger in fudge to create jobs !"

272
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,240
and I can't prove that you won't
create "any" jobs by doing that.

273
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,400
I would argue that, if creating
jobs is your main goal,

274
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,200
there are better ways to do it.

275
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,000
We have the benefit of a test case.
Because in 2004,

276
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,320
we did the exact same thing,
under the American Jobs Creation Act.

277
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,440
It offered a one-year "tax holiday"
where companies

278
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,360
could bring back overseas
profits at a 5 percent tax rate.

279
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,120
The idea was, that they
would then create jobs.

280
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,920
When the Senate looked
at the employment numbers

281
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,920
of the 15 companies that
brought back the most money,

282
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
this is what they found:
these are the average numbers

283
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,080
of U.S. jobs at those companies
over a five-year span.

284
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,920
Here is where the supposedly
job-creating tax holiday kicked in.

285
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,320
And that is underwhelming.
That's the most useless,

286
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,520
ineffective holiday
since Arbor Day.

287
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,200
I'm sorry, Arbor Day, but you're
Secretary's Day for trees.

288
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,480
Instead of hiring workers,
companies rewarded their shareholders,

289
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,120
using 94 cents out of every dollar
they brought home

290
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,240
on stock buybacks and dividends.

291
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,920
You can read about it
in the bestselling book:

292
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,040
"Yeah,
No Fucking Shit They Did That"

293
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,200
by "Everyone Who Knows
Anything About Corporations."

294
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,680
For many companies, that may have
been the best use of their money.

295
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,080
No point in hiring
people you don't need.

296
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,760
The Trump administration
is insisting that this time,

297
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,600
their tax holiday is
already creating jobs.

298
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,640
Some companies seemed
happy to play along.

299
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,080
Apple put out a press release titled

300
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,520
"Apple accelerates
US investment and job creation",

301
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,760
bragging they were about to
create over 20 000 new jobs.

302
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,720
Trump was quick to take credit.

303
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,160
Trump tweeting in response:

304
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,360
"My policies would allow
companies like Apple to bring"

305
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,800
"massive amounts of money
back to the US".

306
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,840
"Great to see Apple follow through
as a result of TAX CUTS," all caps.

307
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,160
That is a solid read
from Jake Tapper there.

308
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:39,080
All anchors should be forced to shout
when Trump uses all caps in tweets.

309
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,840
This morning, the president
announced that he was, quote:

310
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,480
"heading to see the BORDER WALL
prototypes in California."

311
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,840
Or "Today the president wished all
Americans a HAPPY EASTER !"

312
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,520
Those 20 000 Apple jobs were
probably going to happen anyway,

313
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,560
given that the hiring was consistent
with what Apple was doing in the US

314
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,960
before the tax cut bill passed,
Tim Cook knows this.

315
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,720
This is how he responded when asked
how much of his hiring spree

316
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,920
was down
to Trump's new tax plan.

317
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,000
There are large parts of this that
are a result of the tax reform.

318
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,080
There's large parts of this that we
would have done in, in any situation.

319
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,480
I haven't spent a lot of time
in categorizing those two.

320
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:32,440
To me this is about America. It's not
about which bucket you put things in.

321
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,120
Yeah, but actually, it does matter
which bucket you put things in.

322
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,080
I would rather put things in a bucket
labeled "smart economic policy"

323
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,240
than one labeled "Put money in here.
I like money. Tim Cook."

324
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,840
There are legitimate debates
over how, and how much,

325
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,760
we should tax corporate profits.

326
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,400
We had a huge chance to reform
our tax code, and we blew it.

327
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,160
Effective tax reform is not
just about lowering rates,

328
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,080
it's about closing loopholes.

329
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,200
One reasonable idea was forcing
companies to pay a minimum tax

330
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,800
in every single country
they operate in.

331
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,920
Complicated, but that may have
reduced their abuse of tax havens.

332
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,680
That proposal never even
got out of committee.

333
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,240
Our tax code
is still full of loopholes

334
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,080
and however much Trump talked
about how tax reform

335
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,800
would benefit cops and pipefitters,
once he got behind closed doors,

336
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,480
his message changed.

337
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,560
President is still celebrating passage
of the Republican tax cut bill.

338
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,440
Sources with firsthand knowledge
tell CBS News

339
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,080
that he told a group of wealthy
people at his Mar-a-Lago estate,

340
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,200
quote: "You all
just got a lot richer."

341
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:51,160
On Tuesday, as you scrape together
your taxes, and, like Cardi B,

342
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,720
wonder what Uncle Sam is doing
with your motherfucking money,

343
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,480
rest assured that Trump's tax reform
continues to let companies engage

344
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,440
in tax-avoidance schemes.

345
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,720
To those companies I say this:
On behalf of America,

346
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,360
enjoy this double Irish
with a Dutch sandwich.

347
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:14,000
I made it for you myself. Eat it
while it's hot ! And now, this:

348
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,320
Ari Melber, rap genius volume two.
Just Jay-Z quotes.

349
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,760
But the press may need
to rethink this approach

350
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,720
and take some advice
from Jay-Z:

351
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,480
"We know the pain is real, but you
can't heal what you never reveal."

352
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,920
I don't know if you listen
to Jay-Z, he said:

353
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
"if money talks, the whole
world's about to hear me out."

354
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,680
Jay-Z said:
"either love me or leave me alone."

355
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,040
Jay-Z says: "what's better than
one billionaire ? Two."

356
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,400
As Jay-Z said: "men lie,
women lie, numbers don't lie."

357
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,800
A wise man told me
don't argue with fools,

358
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,840
'cause people from a distance
can't tell who's who.

359
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,240
Plead the fifth
when it comes to the fam,

360
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,960
I'm like a dog, I never speak
but I understand.

361
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,840
I'm not a businessman,
I'm a business, man.

362
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,800
Jay-Z always says:
"the streets is watching."

363
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,000
Nobody mentioned reasonable doubt.
You have to acquit if you have...

364
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,800
You mean Jay-Z's first album ?

365
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:20,200
Moving on. Finally tonight,
I'm going to talk about Alaska.

366
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,200
The state we purchased from the grizzly
bears for 50 pounds of salmon.

367
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,840
You stupid fucking bears.

368
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,840
We're gonna take a look at one
of Alaska's endangered resources.

369
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,480
One of Alaska's last Blockbuster stores
is closing to retail sales.

370
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,240
The latest closure follows multiple
Blockbusters shutting their doors.

371
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,520
The North Pole Blockbuster closed
in March, the Wasilla store in January

372
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,840
and the Eagle River location
last July.

373
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,880
We seem to be rapidly losing
something I didn't even know we had,

374
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,840
which is a weird feeling.

375
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,520
Like if Bigfoot walked
with a gun to his head,

376
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,880
saying he exists,
there were four of him,

377
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,920
but he murdered his wife and two kids
and he's not feeling great about it.

378
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,280
Don't do it !
We'll give you a second chance

379
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,920
if you just let us look at your big,
weird feet !

380
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,560
Despite the fact that Blockbuster
filed for bankruptcy in 2010,

381
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,000
there are four independently owned
franchises still operating in the US,

382
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,800
three of which are in Alaska.

383
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,840
Which makes sense because internet
coverage is sparse up there

384
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,240
and without unlimited data,
streaming has been expensive.

385
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,960
And to listen to an employee,
their presence is almost magical.

386
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,200
People come into the parking lot
to take pictures of the building.

387
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,080
People who come in and
they'll walk around like...

388
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,880
You know that person hasn't been
in a Blockbuster in a long time.

389
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,040
They'll also be like "I can't
believe you guys are still here !"

390
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,880
What a fun, but passive-aggressive
interaction that was:

391
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,520
I thought you has-been losers had been
thrown into the trash heap of history !

392
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,360
But you weren't ! Good for you !
I'm off to stream anything I want !

393
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,040
See ya later, punch line !

394
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,800
As internet coverage improves,

395
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,800
those few remaining Blockbusters
are under threat.

396
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,720
If only there were a fun, movie themed
way for them to draw people in,

397
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,200
the way that Planet Hollywood
sucks you in with the chance

398
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,600
to dine alongside the baseball mitt
that out-acted Madonna

399
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,080
in "A League of Their Own"
or Patrick Swayze's clay erection

400
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,360
from the movie "Ghost"
or Tom Cruise's original wife.

401
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,400
Incredible pieces of movie history.

402
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,640
There is no way for a Blockbuster in
Alaska to get memorabilia like that.

403
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,200
Or is there ?
Because a few weeks ago,

404
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,240
we told you about
"Russell Crowe: The Art of Divorce",

405
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,640
an auction in which he was selling
artifacts from his career,

406
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,960
from the "Gladiator" chariot,
to this leather jockstrap

407
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,200
he wore
in the film "Cinderella Man"

408
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,520
which was expected to
attract an ridiculous $500.

409
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,120
The auction
took place last weekend,

410
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,200
and no one paid
$500 for that jockstrap.

411
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,880
One of the more curious items that
went under the hammer

412
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,520
was a leather groin protector used
by Crowe in "Cinderella Man".

413
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,840
Sold for $7 000 to a telephone bidder,
not clear what they plan to use it for.

414
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,080
Holy shit ! $7 000 !

415
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,320
A big price to pay to find out what
Crowe's balls smelled like in 2005.

416
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,960
I'm guessing lilacs with just
a hint of spoiled venison.

417
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,720
There has been speculation
that we bought that jockstrap.

418
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,160
It does sound like something
that we would do:

419
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,560
buy Russell Crowe's jockstrap
and send it to one

420
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,200
of the last remaining
Blockbusters in Alaska.

421
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,640
Even that sentence is absolutely
incredible to say out loud.

422
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,240
The bad news is, we didn't do it.
I'm sorry. We didn't buy it.

423
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,920
We did though.

424
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,800
Except we did.
We absolutely did.

425
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,520
Are you not entertained ?

426
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:14,720
What we didn't do is
buy anything else at that auction.

427
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:23,320
Except we did though.
It was 4 AM over here.

428
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,080
You know what happens when you
start online shopping late at night.

429
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,800
You wake up the next day and you
think: "shit, what did I just buy ?"

430
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,400
This was very much
one of those times.

431
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,760
We didn't just get a jockstrap.

432
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,000
We got a bunch of pointless
Russell Crowe memorabilia

433
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,040
and I can think of no more fitting place
for them than an Alaskan Blockbuster.

434
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,400
Join me, for a guided tour.
First, come with me.

435
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:54,880
First: there is Crowe's director's
chair from "American Gangster".

436
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,240
A movie I had forgotten he was in.
But, he obviously remembered,

437
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,680
he not only took
the back from his chair,

438
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,480
he took the one from
Denzel Washington's as well.

439
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,520
Which obviously
we also bought.

440
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,920
By the way, Denzel Washington's
cost more than his.

441
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:16,360
You are probably thinking:
do you have one of Crowe's costumes ?

442
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,200
Something from "Gladiator" ?
Well, no.

443
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,080
But only because we got
something even better:

444
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,880
the vest he wore
in "Les Misérables !"

445
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,880
Yes, a movie which
"Tacky Vest Weekly" called:

446
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,520
"A triumph !" and that's
not the only costume !

447
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:37,200
We also got this hood he wore
in 2010's "Robin Hood".

448
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,600
Which looks like something
a circumcised penis would wear

449
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,680
to administer a lethal injection.

450
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,920
We know that Russell Crowe wore
a jockstrap in "Cinderella Man".

451
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:53,440
It is famously worth $7 000.
But that movie also featured

452
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,960
this satin robe and gym shorts !

453
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,280
I presume he did,
I presume it's featured them,

454
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,360
I've never seen "Cinderella Man",

455
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,960
despite now owning thousands of dollars
worth of props from it.

456
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,200
I'm never going to see it.
It is 13 dollars on Amazon.

457
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,320
Why would I pay 13 dollars to own
the movie "Cinderella Man ?"

458
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,600
An unforgivable waste of money.
Besides, I don't need to see it.

459
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,240
I've seen the jockstrap.
I basically get it.

460
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,080
To the manager of the only remaining
Blockbuster in Anchorage, Alaska,

461
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,680
at 5600 Debarr Road, number five,
all of this shit is yours.

462
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,960
Call us in the next 48 hours
and we will send it to you.

463
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,320
I hope the internet is good enough up
there for you to see this in time,

464
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,400
because if we do not hear from you
in the next two days,

465
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,840
I know a transportation museum
in Scranton, Pennsylvania,

466
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,560
that I am sure could make room
for a new exhibit.

467
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,960
That's our show, thank you.
See you next week.

468
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,240
Good night !
Are you not entertained ?

469
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,280
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

470
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,480
END OF EPISODE 8,
SEASON V
