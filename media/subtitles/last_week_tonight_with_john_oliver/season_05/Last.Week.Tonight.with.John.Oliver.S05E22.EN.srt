00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,300
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

2
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,600
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

3
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,500
Just in time for a quick recap
of the week,

4
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,200
and it has been a dramatic one
for President Trump.

5
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,700
A flesh vessel possessed
by the world's 30 dumbest ghosts.

6
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,600
On Wednesday, an unnamed
senior white house official

7
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,200
wrote an op-ed in the "Times"
claiming Trump's actions are

8
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,400
"detrimental to the health
of our republic."

9
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,500
Trump immediately pushed back,
tweeting "TREASON?" in all caps,

10
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,900
and then attacked
the anonymous writer at a rally.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,300
<i>The latest act of resistance</i>

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,700
<i>is the op-ed published
in the failing New York Times</i>

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,500
<i>by an "anominoussss"...</i>

14
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,100
<i>Really an "anominousss" gutless coward.</i>

15
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,500
You know, I don't like
Trump's policies, ideas, or demeanor,

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,100
but I do like how he occasionally
sounds like a Teddy Ruxpin

17
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,700
someone fished out of a lake.

18
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,300
Trump is now reportedly obsessed
with finding out the "anonymish" source,

19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,300
although his problem is it seems like

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,400
it could be almost anyone
who works for him.

21
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,700
Because this week also saw
explosive excerpts

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,600
from Bob Woodward's upcoming book,

23
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,600
in which General Mattis
is quoted as saying

24
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,300
"Trump has the understanding
of a fifth or sixth-grader",

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,500
and John Kelly reportedly says,
"We're in Crazytown.

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,500
I don't even know why
any of us are here.

27
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,900
This is the worst job I've ever had."

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,900
Now, both men deny
making those statements,

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,800
and I'm absolutely sure
that Kelly loves his job.

30
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,300
He seems so happy
whenever you see him.

31
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,800
Although, to me,
the book's most incredible claim

32
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,100
is that John Dowd,
the president's then-Lawyer,

33
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
went directly to Robert Mueller
and told him

34
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,100
"Trump was such a disaster
during a practice interrogation

35
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,400
that he couldn't possibly
allow him to testify."

36
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,700
<i>Woodward quotes Dowd as saying</i>

37
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,500
<i>during a March 5th meeting
with Mueller,</i>

38
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,300
<i>"I'm not going to sit there
and let him look like an idiot.</i>

39
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,500
<i>And you publish that transcript
because everything leaks in Washington</i>

40
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,400
<i>and the guys overseas
are going to say,</i>

41
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,000
<i>"I told you he was an idiot.</i>

42
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,300
<i>I told you he was a goddamn dumbbell."</i>

43
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,900
That is incredible.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,400
That is the President's own lawyer
telling a prosecutor,

45
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,600
a prosecutor,

46
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,300
that his client would be
so stupid under questioning

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,700
it would be a genuine
National Security concern.

48
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,200
While Dowd also denies
those comments,

49
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,500
let's just appreciate for a moment
how charming it is

50
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,200
to call anyone a "goddamn dumbbell."

51
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,500
It's so much more delightful
than "idiot", or "dipshit"

52
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,800
or "fucking moron."

53
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,900
"Dumbbell" just puts a fun
cartoon image in your head.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,800
Anyway, the President is a disaster
and we're all going to die.

55
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,400
Meanwhile, the week was dominated
by the confirmation hearings

56
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,900
of controversial supreme court nominee,
Bret Kavanaugh.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,300
He's extremely conservative,

58
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,500
and widely seen as being
a serious threat to,

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,700
among many other things,

60
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,700
abortion rights.

61
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,800
The problem is, beyond a wildly
improbable defection,

62
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,100
republicans have the votes
to get him confirmed.

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,100
And one sign of that

64
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,500
is that while the democrats'
questioning was furious,

65
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,500
republicans didn't even seem
to be trying to vet him.

66
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,200
<i>I do, however, have a very important
question for you.</i>

67
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,500
<i>You use a sharpie.</i>

68
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,000
<i>And it's not a fine-tip sharpie.</i>

69
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,700
<i>It's a regular sharpie
that might smudge.</i>

70
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,900
<i>Why do you prefer that pen?
I'm just dying of curiosity.</i>

71
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,500
<i>So I can see it.</i>

72
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,600
<i>It's nothing scientific.</i>

73
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,000
<i>That is a perfect mic drop moment.</i>

74
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,000
Is it?

75
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Is it though?

76
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't think senator Mike Lee knows
what a "mic drop" moment is.

77
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,300
Unless he means a "mike drop",
in the sense that

78
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,000
"Senator Mike Lee really dropped
the charade

79
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,900
that he gives a shit
about doing his job."

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,300
In which case, yes,
total mike drop, Mike.

81
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,000
You really dropped that one.

82
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,000
Part of the concern here is that

83
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,100
Kavanaugh could be
on the court for decades.

84
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,900
Because it's a lifetime appointment.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,200
And this might be a good time to ask
"Why that is the case?",

86
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,900
because it's extremely unusual.

87
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,300
<i>A lot of other countries follow
our supreme court's pattern</i>

88
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,800
<i>of validating laws.</i>

89
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,700
<i>None of them have life tenure.</i>

90
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,700
<i>There is not a judge in the world
in any democracy</i>

91
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
<i>who sits on the highest court
of their land</i>

92
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,900
<i>and has life tenure.</i>

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,800
Exactly.

94
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,600
Lifetime appointments
to the highest court

95
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,800
is one of those things
that is uniquely american.

96
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,100
Like the Super Bowl,
or drinking Budweiser

97
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,900
or tolerating Sean Penn.

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,200
No one else understands
why americans do those things.

99
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,400
And if you think about it,
it is a little weird.

100
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,600
For one thing, when the constitution
was written,

101
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,300
life expectancy was much shorter

102
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,600
and justices retired much younger.

103
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,800
Now they hang around for so long
that whenever people talk about them,

104
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,500
it's with a morbid overtone.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,300
<i>I think if you're a democrat,</i>

106
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,400
<i>you are praying even more</i>

107
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,100
<i>for Ruth Bader Ginsburg
and her health.</i>

108
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,500
<i>Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83.</i>

109
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,700
<i>Everybody is watching her certainly.</i>

110
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,100
<i>Presumably Ginsberg and Breyer
will try to last</i>

111
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,700
<i>throughout Trump's term.</i>

112
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,300
<i>But, you know, 83 is 83.</i>

113
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,000
<i>She's had a lot of health problems.</i>

114
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,300
Exactly, people are constantly
speculating on TV

115
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,100
about Ruth Bader Ginsburg's health.

116
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,000
It may be why
the new documentary about her

117
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,100
prominently features
her workout routine, which,

118
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,600
depending on your perspective,
either fills you with hope

119
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,400
or makes you worry
that she might be crushed

120
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,000
by a goddamn dumbbell.

121
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:32,900
Her personal trainer even wrote a book
called "The RBG workout."

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,900
And, look, you might laugh
at that idea,

123
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,300
but I've actually tried it, and do I
or do I not have the muscle tone

124
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,900
of a birdlike elderly woman?

125
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,800
Exactly.

126
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,100
The program works.

127
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,900
And look, there are lots of proposals
for how term limits could work.

128
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,600
Under one, justices would serve
18-year terms,

129
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,000
and they would be spaced out

130
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,000
so that each presidential term
would be guaranteed two picks.

131
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,300
That kind of makes sense.

132
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,500
And interestingly, the arguments
against this are pretty weak.

133
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,200
Some claim this would politicize
judicial appointments,

134
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,800
a ship that I would argue
has emphatically sailed at this point.

135
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,900
Others argue that justices
accrue wisdom with experience.

136
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,300
And while that can be true,
you also run the risk of them

137
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,300
staying past the point
that they can mentally do their job,

138
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,700
and that has happened,
as one former clerk explains.

139
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,000
<i>The term "I clerked",</i>

140
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,200
<i>which was the last term
of chief justice burger,</i>

141
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,800
<i>I think six of the justices
were in their 80s.</i>

142
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,900
<i>And I will tell you,
they were not all there.</i>

143
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,100
<i>And it was not
that the law clerks stepped in</i>

144
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,800
<i>and then we did what we wanted.
We didn't.</i>

145
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,600
<i>In a way, that might have
almost been better.</i>

146
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,400
<i>What we did is, we would extrapolate
from their past opinions</i>

147
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,100
<i>where we thought
they would want to go.</i>

148
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,900
Now, just think about
what he's saying there.

149
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,700
Law clerks were reverse
engineering decisions

150
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
based on justices' past rulings.

151
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,700
That is not good.

152
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,000
You don't want hospital interns
saying to a patient,

153
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,000
"Listen, the doctor
is a little out of it today,

154
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,600
but the last time someone came in here,
he amputated their arm,

155
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,400
so let's just go with that,
shall we?"

156
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,900
Look, some argue that
it would just be too difficult,

157
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,900
as it may require
a constitutional amendment.

158
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,900
But over 60% of voters
favor term limits,

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,800
including two-thirds of democrats
and 58% of republicans.

160
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,100
And I know that
amending the Constitution is hard.

161
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,400
It is supposed to be hard.

162
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,000
But that doesn't mean
that it can't be done.

163
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,400
You know, a long time ago,
everyone told a certain british author

164
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,600
that a story about a dorky little boy
with glasses

165
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,600
going to wizard school
would never work.

166
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,300
But those people were wrong.

167
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,500
because that british author's name was
John fucking Oliver.

168
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,400
That's right.

169
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,200
That's right.

170
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,100
"The Adventures of Johnny Abracadabra:
The Pale Wizard Boy

171
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,700
Who Likes to Stay Inside and Read"

172
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,500
is going to take the world by storm
any minute now

173
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,400
once I've ironed out
some legal issues we have.

174
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,000
The point is,

175
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,500
seeing as most of americans
want supreme court term limits,

176
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,600
let's just collectively
Johnny Abracadabra this shit

177
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,300
and put them in place once and for all,

178
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,700
if only so that history
doesn't look back at us

179
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,000
like a bunch of goddamn dumbbells.

180
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,800
And now this.

181
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,400
And now,

182
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,400
a salute to summer festivals.

183
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,600
<i>The Annual Florida Interstate Mullet Toss
has returned.</i>

184
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,000
<i>Thousands will be flocking
to the weekend party</i>

185
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,700
<i>where you get a chance to throw
a dead fish across the state line.</i>

186
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,800
<i>It´s day 3 of the Shrimp
and Petrolium Festival in Morgan City.</i>

187
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,400
<i>The Humungus Fungus Festival
is back in Crystal Falls.</i>

188
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,500
<i>I´m here at the 48th Annual Opossum Festival
with my friend Petey.</i>

189
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,800
<i>The 21st Annual Coffin Races.</i>

190
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,300
<i>The 16th Annual
Frozen Dead Guy Days.</i>

191
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,100
<i>44th Annual Cow Chip Festival.</i>

192
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,700
<i>This is the Annual Moon M-Track Day.</i>

193
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,900
<i>The Annual Chitlin Strut.</i>

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,200
<i>The Annual Testical Festival.</i>

195
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,600
<i>The Annual Roadkill Cook-Off.</i>

196
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,700
<i>National Hollerin´Contest.</i>

197
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,800
<i>Bat Fest still going on right now.</i>

198
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,400
<i>It´s Austins very weird way of showing
our love for the nocturnal creatures.</i>

199
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,400
<i>We want to make sure people understand,
they are not a scary creature.</i>

200
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,300
They are important,
if there weren´t bats

201
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,700
there would be so many in this world
we would not have.

202
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,800
Moving on.

203
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,500
Our main story tonight concerns
"Voting".

204
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,500
For adults, one of the few
remaining activities

205
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,000
for which you still get a sticker.

206
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,000
The midterm Elections
are just two months away,

207
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,700
when every citizen of voting age

208
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,100
will have their chance to be heard,
even this guy.

209
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,300
<i>"Thing" is the category,
and Vanna,</i>

210
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,300
<i>when you're ready.</i>

211
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,000
<i>Edgar.</i>

212
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,200
<i>Fish love?</i>

213
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,500
"Fish love."

214
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,100
Sorry, Edgar,
but the category was "Thing",

215
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
so the answer we were looking for
was "fish lube."

216
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,500
It´s the thing you want use
when you want to fuck a fish.

217
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,500
"Fish lube."

218
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,200
Better luck next time, Edgar.

219
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,600
The fact is, while that fish-fucker may
be able to cast a vote,

220
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,000
a surprisingly large amount of people
are barred from doing so.

221
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,200
<i>It's estimated that more than
six million americans</i>

222
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,400
<i>are barred from voting</i>

223
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,100
<i>because of felony
disenfranchisement laws.</i>

224
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,200
It's true, 6 million people
are unable to vote

225
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,800
because at some point in their life,
they committed a felony.

226
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,800
That is a lot.

227
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,100
For perspective, that's like
if you took all the people

228
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,700
who bought a copy of Robin Thicke's
divorce opera "Paula",

229
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,900
and then added almost 6 million
more people.

230
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,700
And look, if any of you
are thinking at this point,

231
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,100
"Well, who really gives a shit
if convicted felons can't vote?"

232
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,700
You, frankly, wouldn´t be alone.

233
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,100
<i>If they committed crimes,
are they the best people to judge</i>

234
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,100
<i>some of these laws
that are to be passed?</i>

235
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,300
<i>Would we rather live in a society
where there are no consequences</i>

236
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,300
<i>for our actions?</i>

237
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,200
<i>I just think that they've done
something wrong,</i>

238
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,600
<i>so I don't really think
they should be allowed to be voting</i>

239
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,300
<i>in our President and stuff like that.</i>

240
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,200
Oh.

241
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,500
Oh, you don't, do you?

242
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,200
You think, if someone makes a mistake,

243
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,200
it should follow them
for the rest of their life,

244
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,300
whether they were convicted
of marijuana possession

245
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,900
or went to brunch dressed
like a tj maxx janis joplin?

246
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,100
I get it.
I get it.

247
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,200
But the fact here is,
many lawmakers actually agree with her.

248
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,000
Here is Mitch McConnell arguing
that keeping felons from voting

249
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,700
is a public safety issue.

250
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,500
<i>We are talking about rapists,
murderers, robbers,</i>

251
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,300
<i>and even terrorists or spies.</i>

252
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,800
<i>Do we want to see convicted terrorists
who seek to destroy this country</i>

253
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,800
<i>voting in elections?</i>

254
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,400
Okay, first, terrorists are not voting.
Are they?

255
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,600
They're all about making giant
violent points

256
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,000
that get everyone's attention,

257
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,400
not lining up in a public
school gymnasium to write in

258
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,000
"ISIS" for the School Board.

259
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:08,000
And second, the most recent analysis
found only 18% of felony convictions

260
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,700
were for violent crimes of any sort.

261
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,100
Meaning the vast majority
were for non-violent offenses

262
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,700
like property or drug crimes.

263
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,700
And for those who've served
their sentence

264
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,100
but are still unable to vote,

265
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,700
this situation is understandably
frustrating.

266
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,400
<i>At what point do we break the cycle?</i>

267
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,700
<i>At what point are we able to say,
"Hey, you know what?</i>

268
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,100
<i>I am citizen enough.</i>

269
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,500
<i>You want me to work,
you want me to pay taxes,</i>

270
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
<i>you want me to make sure
I take care of my family,</i>

271
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,200
<i>but yet I can't vote.</i>

272
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,600
<i>So am I citizen or am I not a citizen?"</i>

273
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,600
Yeah, he's got a point,

274
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,100
because that man is suffering taxation
without representation.

275
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,400
And historically, that's been a bit
of a sticking point for America.

276
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
I'm pretty sure I learned
about that in school,

277
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,400
something about "the american savages
threw tea into the water

278
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,200
without even have the common decency
to add a splash of milk."

279
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,600
So tonight, let's look
at felony disenfranchisement,

280
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,200
and one state in particular,

281
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,300
because the 6 million
disenfranchised voters

282
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,600
are not evenly distributed
around the country.

283
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,100
In most states,
people with felony convictions

284
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,700
automatically regain
their voting rights at some point.

285
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,700
There are only a few
where they do not.

286
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
And the worst state of all
concerning this

287
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,200
and arguably everything else,
is Florida.

288
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,400
Around 1.5 million of its citizens,

289
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,000
nearly 10% of its adult population,

290
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,200
have completed sentences
for felony convictions

291
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,600
but still can't vote.

292
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,400
And given the inequities
of our justice system,

293
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,100
that burden is disproportionately felt
by african-americans,

294
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,700
because in Florida,
over one in five black adults

295
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,800
cannot vote.

296
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,300
That is staggering.

297
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,000
It may be the dumbest thing
about Florida,

298
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,500
which is frankly impressive,

299
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,200
considering stories like these.

300
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,600
<i>Only in Florida
would an underwear-clad man</i>

301
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,200
<i>go for a walk in the rain
with his pet goat.</i>

302
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,600
<i>Also, if you can tell there,</i>

303
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,600
<i>he's playing a harmonica.</i>

304
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,900
<i>Check out this video showing a genius
steering his motorcycle</i>

305
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,700
<i>with his feet in Jacksonville.</i>

306
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,600
<i>Only in florida does
a creature this adorable</i>

307
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,700
<i>become a bloodthirsty fur demon.</i>

308
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,600
<i>All of a sudden,
he jumped on the kayak,</i>

309
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,900
<i>and two seconds later,
he jumped on me.</i>

310
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,500
<i>The viral video shows Robbie Stratton
running through a convenience store</i>

311
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,000
<i>with an alligator in his hands.</i>

312
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,900
<i>No recollection
of that happening at all?</i>

313
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,300
<i>At all.
This store sells some good liquor.</i>

314
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,500
<i>And I drank a lot of it that night.</i>

315
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,800
Okay, everything about that guy
is absolutely fascinating,

316
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,500
but I think I'm most interested
in the fact that he was drunk

317
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,000
at the store
where he bought the liquor.

318
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,000
Did he buy the liquor, leave,
drink it, fetch an alligator,

319
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,600
and then return to the same store?

320
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,000
Did he drink the liquor at the store,
at which point an alligator walked in?

321
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,200
Or did he get drunk
and then meet a sober alligator

322
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,300
who was having a bad day,

323
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,100
wanted to have a couple of drinks
and the guy said,

324
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,300
"I know just the place, alligator?"

325
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't know.

326
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,100
The point is it's Florida,
so all options are equally plausible.

327
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Here's the thing,
the fact is,

328
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,700
Florida is the disenfranchisement capitol
of America.

329
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,200
So how did that happen?

330
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,400
Well, for starters,
a post-civil war change

331
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,100
to their constitution
stripped all convicted felons

332
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,000
of their voting rights for life.

333
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,300
And while Florida's governor
can restore those rights,

334
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,900
the current one,
Rick Scott,

335
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,500
seen here auditioning for the role
of "happy pencil" in all my nightmares,

336
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,600
he has made this process
much more difficult.

337
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,300
Because while the governor before him
made regaining voting rights

338
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,700
close to automatic for many
non-violent offenses,

339
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,500
Scott implemented a system
where you have to wait five to seven years

340
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,400
just to apply to get your vote back.

341
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,200
Then submit an application.

342
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,600
Then wait more.

343
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,500
Then, in many cases,
have to travel to Tallahassee,

344
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,300
Which no one should ever have to do,
under any circumstances,

345
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,200
to argue your case in person.

346
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,000
These obstacles are ridiculous
and unnecessary,

347
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,900
and this is how Scott justified them.

348
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,700
<i>Look, if you are a convicted felon,</i>

349
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,700
<i>part of what you did is
you lost your rights.</i>

350
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,600
<i>And so you ought to,</i>

351
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,400
<i>there ought to be a process
if you're going to get those rights back.</i>

352
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,400
<i>And I think it's fair
to the rest of the citizens</i>

353
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,500
<i>in the state,
and they'll see a process</i>

354
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,700
<i>that they know will work.</i>

355
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,200
Right, except there is a process
for paying your debt to society

356
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,500
and getting your rights back.

357
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,700
It's called
"serving your fucking sentence".

358
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,000
You're just tagging shit on the end.

359
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,400
It's like someone finishing a triathlon,

360
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,500
only for Scott to then say,
"No, it's a quad-athlon.

361
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,200
Now you have to learn mandarin."

362
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,000
It doesn't really seem fair.

363
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,700
And it's honestly worth
taking a look at this process,

364
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,300
because it's absolutly insane.

365
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,600
Applications are judged
by a clemency board

366
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,300
made up of Rick Scott
and members of his cabinet,

367
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,000
seen here looking
like the only local news team

368
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,100
you somehow know
aren't fucking each other.

369
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,400
And if you do end up in front of them,

370
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,300
you're given ten minutes to prove
that you have turned your life around.

371
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,700
They then question you
before making a decision

372
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,200
that seems completely arbitrary.

373
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,200
And it seems that way
because it is.

374
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,100
Scott begins meetings
by making that painfully clear.

375
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,000
<i>This is a board of clemency,
okay?</i>

376
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,500
<i>There is no law we're following.</i>

377
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,200
<i>The law had already been followed
by the judges.</i>

378
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,400
<i>So we get to make our decisions
based on our own beliefs.</i>

379
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
<i>There's no standards.</i>

380
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,400
<i>Each of us have the right opportunity
to make a decision</i>

381
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,900
<i>based on what we believe.</i>

382
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,900
<i>This is a court of mercy.</i>

383
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
<i>It's not a court,
there's no,</i>

384
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
<i>if you walk up and say,
"I deserve something",</i>

385
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,600
<i>that's not how this works.</i>

386
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:14,200
<i>We, there is no,
there is absolutely no standards.</i>

387
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,600
<i>So we can make
any decision we want.</i>

388
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,800
You know,
I'm sure that's true,

389
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,300
it's just weird to hear it
said out loud,

390
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,700
in the same way it would be weird
to hear the CEO of Kraft Foods say,

391
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,600
"We don't actually know
what Velveeta is.

392
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,500
It fell from space in the 1950s

393
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,400
and has been spawning
in a lab ever since.

394
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,700
Before we package it,
we take out the teeth and eyes,

395
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,000
but we're starting to think
that makes it angry."

396
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,100
And look, because there are
no formal standards,

397
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,000
the Committee can decide
what's important

398
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,800
and can focus on things as petty
as moving violations.

399
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,600
<i>What we're trying to figure out is,</i>

400
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,400
<i>is that have people changed their lives?</i>

401
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,500
<i>- Right?
- Right.</i>

402
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,000
<i>And that's, so,
so getting traffic tickets all the time,</i>

403
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,500
<i>to, if you sit up here,
your first reaction is,</i>

404
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,200
<i>well, do they really respect
the law, right?</i>

405
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,700
Right.

406
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,200
I mean, that might be
your first reaction.

407
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,800
To be honest,
my first reaction is,

408
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,200
why are Rick Scott's glasses
not near the eyes part of his head?

409
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And how have they not fallen off
his nose by now?

410
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,200
And look, it is not just
your driving record under scrutiny.

411
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,500
Your personal life
is very much on the table,

412
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,400
and one board member,
Florida CFO Jimmy Patronis,

413
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,500
seems to have a specific idea of where
that personal life should be conducted,

414
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,100
because there's one question
that he asks a lot.

415
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,000
<i>- Y'all go to church?
- Y'all go to church?</i>

416
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,400
<i>- Y'all go to the church together?
- Ma'am, where do y'all go to church?</i>

417
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
<i>- Do you go to church?
- And go to church?</i>

418
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,600
"Do you go to church?"

419
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,800
Now, if the answer to that question
is important,

420
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,100
that is fucked up.

421
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,200
And if it's not,
why are you constantly asking it?

422
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,800
Either you're factoring religious habits
into your evaluation

423
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,600
of whether someone should be able to vote

424
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,800
or you're making
a list of people's houses

425
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,900
that would be easy to rob
on a sunday morning.

426
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,100
And neither is a good use
of the panel's time.

427
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,900
And once you've jumped
through all of these hoops,

428
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,100
your fate is in the hands of a panel
who do not have to explain

429
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,300
their reasoning to you.

430
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,600
Just watch Leon Gillis.

431
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,200
He had served time for robbery
and drug convictions

432
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,500
but had been clean for eight years
and was running a drug rehab program

433
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,000
when he made his case
to the board in 2011.

434
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,200
Rick scott actually commended him
for the progress that he'd made,

435
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,500
and then said this.

436
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,700
<i>So at this point I'm going
to deny restoration of civil rights.</i>

437
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,700
<i>Can I ask you a question?</i>

438
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,500
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

439
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,300
<i>How long is that?</i>

440
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,600
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

441
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,700
<i>I, um,
you know,</i>

442
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,000
<i>I think every case is different.</i>

443
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
<i>Well, what should I do with my life then?</i>

444
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,200
<i>If I'm doing everything
I'm supposed to do and I'm trying,</i>

445
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,300
<i>and I'm making sure that I do
the right thing I'm supposed to do,</i>

446
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,300
<i>then how long am I supposed to wait?</i>

447
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,900
<i>I couldn't tell you that answer
but if, uh,</i>

448
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,900
<i>today I don't feel comfortable doing it.</i>

449
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,800
<i>Okay.</i>

450
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,600
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

451
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,300
And that was it.

452
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,300
He refused to restore someone's
civil rights

453
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,200
without demonstrating much more
of a reason than,

454
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,600
"I dunno, I guess
I'm just not feeling it right now."

455
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,200
And the thing is,
even if this process was perfect,

456
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,700
which it is not,
it can't handle the volume.

457
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,500
The panel only meets four times a year,

458
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,900
and there are too many cases
for them to review.

459
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,200
Also, while Scott's predecessor restored
the voting rights of over 155,000 people

460
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,800
in his four-year term,
Scott is only averaging around 400 a year.

461
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,400
And that is meaningful,
especially in a state

462
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,200
where elections tend to have
very narrow margins.

463
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,900
Trump only won Florida
by 100 thousand votes.

464
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,700
And President Bush, famously,
won it by just 537.

465
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,200
But there's actually some
genuinely good news here.

466
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,600
Florida has a chance to fix this.
A real chance.

467
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,600
There is a constitutional amendment
on their ballot this November

468
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,100
that would bring Florida in line
with many other states.

469
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
If it passes,
people with felony convictions,

470
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,200
except in the cases of murder
or sex crimes,

471
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,900
would get the right to vote
after completing their sentence.

472
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,800
That could give as many
as 1.4 million people

473
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,700
the right to vote.

474
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,100
But it is by no means
a foregone conclusion.

475
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,200
The amendment needs
a 60% majority to pass.

476
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,800
So if it's okay with everybody,

477
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,100
I would like to speak directly
to the people of Florida for a second.

478
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,800
Hi there, Florida.

479
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,500
Let's try and get comfortable
with each other, shall we?

480
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,700
I know,
I know that,

481
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:20,100
I know that we make fun
of you a lot, Florida,

482
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,400
because of all the stupid things
that happen where you live.

483
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,900
And you're probably expecting me
to steer away from all that

484
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,300
and appeal to your innate goodness
and sense of reason.

485
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,200
But I'm not going to do that.
Instead, I'd like to double down

486
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,700
and suggest that it's precisely
because of all that glorious stupidity

487
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,300
that you should innately appreciate
the value of second chances.

488
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,600
I mean,
come on Florida.

489
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,400
You're Florida,
a state that has seen the headlines,

490
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,700
"Florida restaurant no longer allows
'Monkey Mondays'

491
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,100
after animal bit 8-year-old boy",

492
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,300
and "Florida bestiality law
does not ban oral sex with animals",

493
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,400
and "Florida gas station robbed,
suspect appeared to have drawn-on beard,

494
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,600
Which I would say is probably true,
given that this was the beard.

495
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,200
And yes,
yes, floridians,

496
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,500
you do make mistakes,
but it's also in your nature

497
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,200
to help one another recover,
as you can tell from the headline

498
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:15,600
"Good samaritan helps florida man
who accidentally shot himself in the penis."

499
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,400
You come through for each other!

500
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,400
Even this song,
your state song,

501
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,400
speaks to your ability to screw up
and bounce back.

502
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
The original lyrics to this
had to be changed

503
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,900
because they were too racist.

504
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,500
And somehow,
it still sounds racist today,

505
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,700
even in instrumental form.

506
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,900
The point is,
this November, Florida,

507
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,600
you have got a real chance

508
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,800
to remedy a mistake
and do something genuinely good

509
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,500
for over a million of your citizens.

510
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,800
So please,
on November 6th,

511
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,100
for one day,
just one day,

512
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,600
don't take your goat for a walk
in your underwear,

513
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:54,500
stay away from any bitey otters,
draw a fake beard on yourself,

514
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,100
and go cast a vote
on behalf of all your fellow floridians

515
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
who are unable to.
Please do it.

516
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,400
Cheers, florida.

517
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,100
Cheers.

518
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,200
And now this.

519
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,800
And now.

520
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,400
It's that time of year again...

521
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,100
<i>It´s the unofficial start of fall
at Starbucks</i>

522
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,786
<i>with the return
of the Pumpkin Spice latte.</i>

523
00:22:16,886 --> 00:22:20,886
<i>Holy fucking shit!
It´s Pumpkin Spice Latte Time!</i>

524
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:24,449
<i>It´s that time of year again.
Pumpkin Spice season is almost upon us.</i>

525
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:25,549
Yeah!!!!!!!!!!

526
00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:28,949
<i>You know how much Jim Cramer
loves Pumpkin Spice lattes!</i>

527
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:30,149
I have a question for you.

528
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:32,249
<i>Why do we love Pumpkin Spice products
so much?</i>

529
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:33,749
<i>Fuck you, Dr. Oz!</i>

530
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:38,049
Real doctors know it´s because
Pumpkin Spice lattes are delicious!

531
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:41,349
<i>Is this Spice Latte hot or cold,
I'm not a starbucks fan.</i>

532
00:22:41,449 --> 00:22:43,449
- It´s hot, right?
- It´s how you order it baby.

533
00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:45,049
<i>You can get it however you want.</i>

534
00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:49,349
<i>Shes right!
Pumpkin Spice lattes contain multitudes!</i>

535
00:22:49,949 --> 00:22:52,449
But I think that when you hear
Pumpkin Spice coming back,

536
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:54,549
<i>you have to believe the summer
is almost over.</i>

537
00:22:54,649 --> 00:22:56,649
<i>I don't want to think
about that right now.</i>

538
00:22:56,749 --> 00:22:59,249
- I´m in denial about that.
- Me too.

539
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:01,749
<i>You can't deny the cruel
and indifferent task of time!</i>

540
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:05,449
Maria Bartiromo!
Pumpkin Spice lattes are upon us!

541
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:07,749
<i>Starbucks is getting ready for fall</i>

542
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:11,249
<i>when you can order
the Pumpkin Spice latte.</i>

543
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,349
<i>They are going to make it year-round
at some point.</i>

544
00:23:13,449 --> 00:23:15,949
<i>- They just got to.
- Wait until they make it intravenous.</i>

545
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:21,249
<i>Hell Yeah!
Slam a Pumpkin Spice latte into my veins!</i>

546
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:26,449
Finally tonight,

547
00:23:27,249 --> 00:23:28,149
Finally tonight,

548
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,349
I'd like to talk for a moment
about "Space",

549
00:23:32,449 --> 00:23:34,049
basically,
a few points of interest

550
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:36,649
separated by a terrifying expanse
of frozen nothingness.

551
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,749
Think of it like North Dakota,
but significantly blacker.

552
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:44,449
Last week,
the International Space Station

553
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:45,649
had a bit of a scare.

554
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:48,249
<i>We're learning
that the International Space Station</i>

555
00:23:48,349 --> 00:23:50,249
<i>apparently has sprung a leak.</i>

556
00:23:50,349 --> 00:23:53,649
<i>Mission control noticed pressure
on board the station</i>

557
00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:55,149
<i>started dropping slowly.</i>

558
00:23:55,249 --> 00:23:58,449
<i>They alerted astronauts on board
who found a tiny hole</i>

559
00:23:58,549 --> 00:24:00,849
<i>the size of a dime.</i>

560
00:24:00,949 --> 00:24:03,149
<i>The solution,
what else,</i>

561
00:24:03,249 --> 00:24:04,749
high-tech duct tape.

562
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:06,349
"What else?"

563
00:24:06,449 --> 00:24:09,049
I don't know,
I was hoping lots of other things.

564
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:10,949
Your first answer to

565
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,449
"What should we use to fix the hole
in the Space Station?"

566
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:16,749
shouldn't be the same stuff I would use
to fix a broken leg on a cat.

567
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:20,549
although, seeing as my first answer to
"How should you fix a cat?" was that

568
00:24:20,649 --> 00:24:24,149
I might not be the one you want
to turn to for engineering questions.

569
00:24:24,249 --> 00:24:27,049
Look, this is clearly
extremely frightening.

570
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:29,049
And experts
initially believed that the hole

571
00:24:29,149 --> 00:24:31,249
was caused
by a micro-meteorite strike.

572
00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:33,949
But this week,
the story took a dramatic turn.

573
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:36,849
<i>The hole found
in the International Space Station</i>

574
00:24:36,949 --> 00:24:39,049
<i>may have been an inside job.</i>

575
00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:41,449
<i>Experts warning a homesick astronaut</i>

576
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:44,649
<i>could have deliberately
drilled a hole in the satellite,</i>

577
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:47,249
<i>forcing everyone
to return to Earth early.</i>

578
00:24:47,349 --> 00:24:48,849
Holy shit!

579
00:24:48,949 --> 00:24:50,349
Well,
if you were wondering

580
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:52,349
what sits at the center
of the Venn Diagram

581
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:55,649
of the wild speculation on Fox News
and topics of Elton John songs,

582
00:24:55,749 --> 00:24:57,849
we've found it,
and it's "homesick astronaut."

583
00:24:58,349 --> 00:25:02,049
But the thing is, they're actually
only slightly exaggerating there,

584
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:04,149
because Russia's space agency
did announce

585
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:05,949
that the hole appeared to be drilled

586
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:08,849
by what they described as
"a human hand"

587
00:25:08,949 --> 00:25:12,049
and didn't rule out
deliberate interference in space.

588
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:14,649
And obviously,
that is an explosive allegation,

589
00:25:14,749 --> 00:25:17,349
because the implication
is that one of these six astronauts,

590
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,349
professionals at the very top
of their field,

591
00:25:19,449 --> 00:25:21,749
may have drilled the hole
on purpose.

592
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:23,249
That is a space crime.

593
00:25:23,349 --> 00:25:27,549
And that kind of speculation
isn't just irresponsible,

594
00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:32,049
it's clearly incredibly fun,
because the situation right now

595
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:34,849
is that we have a "Space Who-Dunnit?"
on our hands.

596
00:25:34,949 --> 00:25:38,349
So, let me introduce you to
"Last Week Tonight: SVU."

597
00:25:38,449 --> 00:25:41,449
That is
"Spaceship Ventilation, Unexpected."

598
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:43,649
Come with me.

599
00:25:43,749 --> 00:25:45,049
Come with me right now, please.

600
00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:48,449
Because we are going to get
to the bottom, right here,

601
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:52,349
right now, of who's responsible
for this space hole.

602
00:25:52,449 --> 00:25:54,649
So, which one of these astronauts
could it be?

603
00:25:54,749 --> 00:25:57,649
Was it Drew Feustel,
mission commander?

604
00:25:57,749 --> 00:25:59,449
Was it Alexander Gerst?

605
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:01,549
His hobbies apparently include
skydiving.

606
00:26:01,649 --> 00:26:03,649
Was he looking for the ultimate fall?

607
00:26:03,749 --> 00:26:05,949
Was it Sergey Prokopyev?

608
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:08,749
His bio on the ISS website
is all in russian,

609
00:26:08,849 --> 00:26:10,649
so I don't know anything about him.

610
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:13,349
That is immediately suspicious to me.

611
00:26:13,449 --> 00:26:16,749
Or could it be his fellow cosmonaut,
Oleg Artemyev?

612
00:26:16,849 --> 00:26:19,649
Did he snap after being
constantly teased for his obsession

613
00:26:19,749 --> 00:26:21,349
with horizontally striped shirts?

614
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:25,449
Throw a vertical shirt in there, Oleg.
You look like a space mime.

615
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:29,249
Was it former flight surgeon
Serena Aunon, chancellor?

616
00:26:29,349 --> 00:26:32,549
Or was it our final suspect,
Ricky Arnold?

617
00:26:32,649 --> 00:26:34,349
Now, I'm not saying he's guilty.

618
00:26:34,449 --> 00:26:37,349
What I am saying is,
if you trust a grown man named Ricky,

619
00:26:37,449 --> 00:26:38,649
you're a fucking idiot.

620
00:26:38,749 --> 00:26:42,249
So these are all of our options.

621
00:26:42,349 --> 00:26:43,949
Or are they?

622
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:47,949
Because it turns out there are more
than just people on board.

623
00:26:48,249 --> 00:26:51,749
<i>Also on board the capsule
are genetically identical brown mice</i>

624
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:54,849
<i>for a study of their gut bacteria.</i>

625
00:26:54,949 --> 00:26:55,949
It's true.

626
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:59,349
It turns out there are also 20 mice
on the Space Station.

627
00:26:59,449 --> 00:27:01,149
Or rather,
there were 20,

628
00:27:01,249 --> 00:27:03,849
because apparently ten of them
have already been dissected

629
00:27:03,949 --> 00:27:06,049
in an experiment,
giving the remaining mice

630
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:09,649
the perfect motive to engage
in space-sabotage.

631
00:27:09,749 --> 00:27:10,849
So,
and this is true,

632
00:27:10,949 --> 00:27:14,349
we actually contacted NASA
and asked if they could provide us

633
00:27:14,449 --> 00:27:16,449
with photos and names of the mice.

634
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:18,149
They told us,
and I quote,

635
00:27:18,249 --> 00:27:21,549
"We do not name the mice
and don't have photos of them."

636
00:27:21,649 --> 00:27:26,149
Sounds like a dodge to me.
So, we made our own.

637
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:30,249
What I'm asking you is,
who was it?

638
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:31,649
Was it Fuzz Aldrin?

639
00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:33,049
Neil Tailstrong?

640
00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:34,449
Rodent Polanski?

641
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:35,749
Mice Dallas Howard?

642
00:27:35,849 --> 00:27:37,049
Maus von Bulow?

643
00:27:37,149 --> 00:27:38,149
Chairman Mouse?

644
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:39,749
Isabella Rossa-Cheese-I?

645
00:27:39,849 --> 00:27:40,949
John Leguizamouse?

646
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:42,249
Forest Whisker?

647
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:43,649
Or was it Dave?

648
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:44,449
Who can say?

649
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:45,249
Who can say?

650
00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:47,149
We tried getting more information
out of NASA.

651
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,649
We actually asked them
if any of the mice were going through

652
00:27:49,749 --> 00:27:52,949
any sort of personal trauma,
like a bankruptcy or divorce.

653
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:55,049
They told us,
and again I quote,

654
00:27:55,149 --> 00:27:59,549
"An attending veterinarian monitors
the mice through all phases of flight."

655
00:27:59,649 --> 00:28:02,649
Which is not what we asked them.
Is it?

656
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:05,449
At this point,
we were understandably suspicious,

657
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:07,149
so we asked them,
"Are you a human,

658
00:28:07,249 --> 00:28:10,749
or are you a mouse working
with the space mice from the inside?"

659
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:13,949
To which NASA replied,
and again I swear this is true,

660
00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:16,249
"I am, in fact,
a human."

661
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:19,149
Which is exactly
what a space mouse would say.

662
00:28:19,249 --> 00:28:22,949
We're clearly on to something here,
and I'm inviting all of you at home

663
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:27,049
to help solve which of these mice
is responsible for the space hole.

664
00:28:27,149 --> 00:28:27,649
In fact,

665
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:31,549
we'll be devoting the entire 30 minutes
of next week's show

666
00:28:31,649 --> 00:28:32,549
to this story.

667
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:35,349
And know this,
if I am not here next sunday night,

668
00:28:35,449 --> 00:28:38,749
the only reason
is because the mice got to me.

669
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:41,249
That is our show.
Thank you so much for watching.

670
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:42,649
Good night!

671
00:28:42,749 --> 00:28:43,949
Find the mice.

672
00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:46,349
Find the mice.
