LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,430
SEASON V
EPISODE 15

3
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,530
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,430
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,420
A quick recap of the week
and we begin with Donald Trump.

6
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,330
President of the US
and the love of Melania's life.

7
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,530
Trump had a bit
of an up-and-down time this week.

8
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,300
His former lawyer,
Michael Cohen, sought new counsel,

9
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,350
prompting many to speculate
he's about to flip on Trump.

10
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,310
Why would he do that ? A random
New Yorker probably expressed it best.

11
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,430
It's that guy that's going to jail !
Awesome, way to go, bud.

12
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,890
Who says New Yorkers
aren't friendly ?

13
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,840
We might not say
"hello" to you,

14
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,930
but we will always give you
a "good luck in the big house",

15
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,930
when the situation demands it.

16
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,860
Trump's week began with the eyes
of the world upon him

17
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,000
as he met with this cutie patootie
for a historic summit.

18
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,920
If you listen to Trump,
it was a huge success.

19
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,060
After landing at Joint Base Andrews,
Trump tweeted:

20
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,850
"everybody can feel safer
than the day I took office."

21
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,910
"No longer a Nuclear Threat
from North Korea."

22
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,900
Adding: "sleep well tonight !"

23
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:42,020
Donald Trump telling me
I can "sleep well tonight"

24
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,850
is like the Grim Reaper telling me
to have a happy birthday.

25
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,910
His presence
is the reason I will not.

26
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,040
The deal Trump made
with Kim Jong Un was underwhelming.

27
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,870
They agreed to "work toward
denuclearization of Korean Peninsula"

28
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,850
which isn't just ambiguous compared
to previous agreements,

29
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,880
it's also close to meaningless.

30
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,140
What America got out of this deal
appears to be a Trump specialty,

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,280
that I'm gonna call
the "ice cream blowjob":

32
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,190
he announces something
that sounds great,

33
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,270
but when you think about it,
isn't actually anything.

34
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,160
The genuinely remarkable
thing about the summit

35
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,200
was the deference that Trump
showed to his counterpart.

36
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,220
While diplomacy involves
sucking up to horrible people,

37
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,230
Trump went above and beyond.

38
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,160
He's got a great personality.
He's a funny guy,

39
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,280
he's a very smart guy,
a great negotiator.

40
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,120
I think he liked me and I like him.
He's smart, loves his people,

41
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,060
he wants a lot of good things
and that's why he's doing this.

42
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,300
Quickly on that: no, he doesn't,
no, he isn't; no, he's not;

43
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,100
no, he isn't; no, he didn't;
no, he isn't; no he doesn't;

44
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,260
no he doesn't and that's
not why he's doing it.

45
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,190
I'm not gonna say that part of
Trump's admiration for Kim

46
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,140
is that he wishes
he could be a dictator as well.

47
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,120
I'm gonna let him say that.

48
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,310
He's the head of a country and
I mean, he's the strong head.

49
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,460
Don't let anyone think
anything different.

50
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,330
He speaks and his people sit up,
I want my people to do the same.

51
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,520
That is the President of the US,
expressing a wish that people

52
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,390
would model themselves after
the malnourished North Korea.

53
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,470
Maybe he meant that White House
staff should sit up,

54
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,410
maybe he meant everyone should,
but either way:

55
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,500
the president
wishes he was a dictator.

56
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,480
Which is a dire realization,
right up there with:

57
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,460
"the robots have become sentient"
or "the cat has power of attorney".

58
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,330
How the fuck did we get here ?

59
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,520
The last few days have sadly
been dominated by this story.

60
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,410
Growing national outrage about children
separated from their parents

61
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,500
who crossed
into the country illegally.

62
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,310
Nearly 2 000 children have been
separated from their parents

63
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,470
under the administration's
zero-tolerance policy.

64
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,320
Thousands of children have been
forcibly taken from their parents

65
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,400
after a policy shift put into action
last month by U.S. Attorney General

66
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,500
and "least fun thing to find in
a Kinder Egg", Jeff Sessions.

67
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:20,410
He started a policy of incarcerating
people who cross the border illegally,

68
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,540
knowing that would mean they were
separated from their children,

69
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,380
many of whom are less
than ten years old,

70
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,430
with no clear plan as to
when they might be reunited.

71
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:36,410
Trump inexplicably argued
that Sessions had no choice.

72
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,450
He's following laws given to us
and forced upon us by the Democrats.

73
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,610
But there's no law that says
foreigners should be separated...

74
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,590
The democrats gave us the laws.

75
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,620
I want the laws to be beautiful,
humane, but strong.

76
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,560
"Beautiful, humane but strong" ?
That is not how you describe a law.

77
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,470
That's how you describe a Viola Davis
character in a movie called

78
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,380
"It Hasn't Even Been Written Yet
But She'll Still Win The Oscar."

79
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,400
Democrats did not give them these laws,
because there is no law

80
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,520
that required separating parents
from their children.

81
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,470
This was the result of a deliberate
policy choice by Jeff Sessions,

82
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,630
a man so small, he can wear,
and this is true, a raspberry as a hat.

83
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,470
That's a fact.

84
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,640
It's weird that Trump tried
to distance himself from this decision,

85
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,510
because Sessions doubled down,

86
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,600
saying that this command came
right from the very top.

87
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,620
I would cite you
to the Apostle Paul

88
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,670
and his clear and wise command
in Romans 13,

89
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,590
to obey the laws of the government
because God has ordained

90
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,510
the government for his purposes.

91
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,550
It's not a law. And also, the Bible
isn't a government document.

92
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,590
From a policy perspective, he might
as well be citing "Green Eggs And Ham"

93
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,550
saying: "we must keep children in
a box, we must keep them with a fox."

94
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,700
A terrible policy,
depending on the height of the fox.

95
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,590
Children should be kept away from
foxes above a certain height,

96
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,660
because they're very weird
and scary.

97
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,540
Hashtag no tall foxes.

98
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:18,780
Romans 13 is the worst
Bible passage to bring up,

99
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,820
since it was invoked in Civil War
times by defenders of slavery.

100
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,940
I know you're probably
thinking, wait:

101
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,940
"he wouldn't align himself
with slave-owners, even accidentally.

102
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,950
Not Jefferson Beauregard
Sessions Of Alabama !"

103
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,890
I'm sorry, but he did. And
when Sarah Huckabee Sanders

104
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,990
was asked about Sessions' Bible
defense, she backed him up.

105
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,890
I can say that it is
very biblical to enforce the law.

106
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,890
That is repeated a number
of times throughout the Bible.

107
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:53,870
So, not a fucking law !
Lots of things are said in the Bible

108
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,950
but that doesn't mean
you should do them.

109
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,960
At one point the Bible demands the
head of government get 100 foreskins,

110
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,780
but I don't think Sanders is looking
for Congress to gather and slice dicks.

111
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,870
The Trump administration might want
to go a little easy

112
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,810
on holding the Bible up
as a moral code.

113
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,980
The Bible is not a big fan of adultery,
gluttony,

114
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,910
coveting your neighbor's wife,
pride or wrath.

115
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:25,970
You shouldn't use the Bible to justify
separating children from parents,

116
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,970
but if you do, make sure you're not
already breaking so many of its rules

117
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,970
that God has to write an extra
commandment: "I was fucking serious".

118
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,920
And now this.

119
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:42,000
Senator Chuck Schumer is caught in
an endless graduation-speech time loop.

120
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,010
When I was at college graduation,
I had just learned

121
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:50,010
that I had won a scholarship
to travel all around the world

122
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,110
at the same time I had met
a girl and I fell in love.

123
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,900
And I was torn.

124
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,920
Do I go around the world on
the paid scholarship for a year ?

125
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,130
Or do I stay home with the girl,
my first true love.

126
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,960
Class of 2018
what would you have done ?

127
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,320
Class of 2017,
class of 2016, 2015, 2014...

128
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,260
13... 12... 11... 2005

129
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,270
What would you have done ?
I stayed home with the girl.

130
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,230
She dumped me
before Labor Day.

131
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,290
There I was, no scholarship, no trip
around the world, no girl...

132
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,190
No girl... Girl...

133
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,290
No girl.
But somehow I picked myself up,

134
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,140
dusted myself off
and a few years later,

135
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,350
I found myself seated
at graduation once again.

136
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,150
Once again...

137
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,290
When I was seated at college
graduation I had just learned

138
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,280
I had won a scholarship to
travel all around the world...

139
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,330
All around the world...

140
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,210
Our main story tonight
concerns China.

141
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,280
The country responsible
for huge technological advances

142
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,220
and yet, it still can't seem
to get pandas to fuck.

143
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,280
China is a gigantic
and consequential country

144
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,810
where roughly one
out of every five people on earth live.

145
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,920
It is also the place Trump
has been ranting about for years.

146
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,780
China is killing us.
What China's doing to us is horrible.

147
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,700
China cheats.
They devalue their currency.

148
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,920
We can't continue to allow China
to rape our country.

149
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,850
So even in the context of a metaphor,
the word "rape" is pretty jarring.

150
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,830
As verbs go,
it's not bandied about.

151
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,840
It's like if Trump said, Congress is
toe-fucking me on this border wall.

152
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,870
The underlying point is clear.
Why he express it that way is not.

153
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,880
For all that Trump talks about China,
it seems he's learning about it.

154
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,730
Microphones
picked up this exchange

155
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,790
with China's President during
a state visit in November.

156
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,770
China, five thousand
years it goes back, right ?

157
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,860
Yes, three thousand years
of written history.

158
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,890
The oldest culture they say
is Egypt at eight thousand.

159
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,920
Yes, that's true.
Egypt is older than China.

160
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,650
If you are worried that Trump
learned something, rest assured:

161
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,610
the only thing he took away
was that Egypt is older

162
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,710
and therefore
less fuckable than China.

163
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,610
"Okay, great. Note to self:
don't fuck Egypt. Too old."

164
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,790
A lot of us are probably
under informed about China.

165
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,780
That's something that its leaders
have historically been fine with.

166
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:43,690
Deng Xiaoping famously had
a "lay low" international strategy,

167
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,590
summed up by the saying: "hide
your strength and bide your time."

168
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,640
In recent years, there has been
a shift regarding that.

169
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,740
When China's current leader,
Xi Jinping,

170
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,610
assumed the highest office,
he said this.

171
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,750
China needs to learn
more about the world.

172
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,640
The world also needs
to learn more about China.

173
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,730
He's right. We probably
should talk more about China.

174
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,660
We should have talked more
about it on this show.

175
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,760
Considering we've done
4 000 stories on New Zealand

176
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:19,610
and multiple pieces on a testicle
receptacle from "Cinderella Man".

177
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:24,900
Tonight let's talk about China.
And let's put America aside

178
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,900
and talk instead about China
on its own terms.

179
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,710
It's been going through seismic social,
economic, and political changes,

180
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,920
which have happened quickly.

181
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,890
Many center on its leader, Xi Jinping,
who tightened his grip on power.

182
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,760
The most dramatic political
change in China in decades:

183
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,900
a vote to scrap term limits
for China's president.

184
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:54,700
The move clears the way for Xi Jinping
to stay in power possibly for life.

185
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,930
Of nearly 3 000 ballots only two voted
against the unprecedented move.

186
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,710
3 000 to two ! After that vote,
two members of Chinese Parliament

187
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,800
thinking: "I really thought that
would go the other way."

188
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,700
Maybe an Edible Arrangement
will smooth things over

189
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,770
with the man
who's now emperor for life.

190
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:20,740
That followed on the heels of what
was an even bigger change:

191
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,880
the fact that, last October,
Xi's political doctrine,

192
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,090
"Xi Jinping Thought", was
enshrined in the party's constitution.

193
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,090
That may not sound
like much to you,

194
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,020
but it's the equivalent of Trump
making himself a Founding Father

195
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,920
and including "Donald Trump Thought"
into the Constitution.

196
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,040
Historians
would have to parse the meaning

197
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,000
of "while Bette Midler is
an unattractive woman",

198
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,980
"I refuse to say that because
I insist on being politically correct."

199
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,080
Xi's consolidation of power
has been aided by the fact

200
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,010
that, unlike his predecessors,
who've tended to be bureaucrats,

201
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,870
he's gone out of his way to form
a cult of personality about himself.

202
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,050
For a time state media called him
"Xi Dada", or "Uncle Xi".

203
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,880
Both are objectively weird names
for an adult to call another adult

204
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,930
but fantastic names
for a pair of hairless cats:

205
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,080
"Xi Dada ! Uncle Xi ! Dinner's
ready, you creepy weirdos !"

206
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,980
Xi carefully presents
a "man of the people" image.

207
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,030
Born into an elite family,
his father fell from grace

208
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,770
and like many,
during Mao's Cultural Revolution,

209
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,740
Xi was sent to work in a village,
which has now become a tourist trap.

210
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,670
The smartly-dressed tour guide
shows us where Xi slept.

211
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,560
An old picture on the wall.
We see a well he helped dig.

212
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,720
A sewing shop he set up. Old
farmers who knew Xi back then,

213
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,620
still roam about the pseudo-mascots
of this bizarre theme park.

214
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,780
That is a bizarre theme park.

215
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,760
I say that knowing that this
country's most beloved theme park

216
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,760
features vomit-inducing teacups

217
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,540
and a massive pants-less sailor duck
with no genitals.

218
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,780
Xi's branding isn't confined
to tourist attractions.

219
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,710
State media has featured folksy
moments like this video of him

220
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,690
ordering pork buns
at a Beijing restaurant.

221
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,560
That visit was
huge news in China.

222
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:19,640
Hard to believe, our politicians eat
junk food in front of us all the time.

223
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,570
You can find photos of twelve
of the last twelve presidents

224
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,620
shoving ice cream into their faces.

225
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,040
It's legitimately challenging
to find a single photo of Obama

226
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,920
where he is not about
to inhale half a pint of vanilla.

227
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:37,940
I didn't remember he'd been demolishing
a waffle cone during the Bin Laden raid

228
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,030
but I'd remembered it wrong,
I was wrong.

229
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,020
The reasons for Xi's popularity
go beyond marketing himself

230
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,870
as a cuddly Xi Dada that you can
grab a pork bun with.

231
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:53,030
He is riding an economic wave
that long precedes him.

232
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,940
Over the last 30 years,

233
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,070
China's GDP growth has averaged
nearly 10 percent a year,

234
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:03,090
"the fastest sustained expansion
by a major economy in history"

235
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,960
which enabled more than 800 million
to lift themselves out of poverty.

236
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,900
Many in China's growing middle class
are content with how things go.

237
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,930
The tremendous public
optimism is striking.

238
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,940
Everyone is doing better than
their parents did in their day.

239
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:24,000
We'll be able to move to a bigger
house within the next five years

240
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,930
and I expect my life
to improve a lot.

241
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,210
Whatever happens, I'm very
optimistic about the future.

242
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,150
A sense of optimism
about the future.

243
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,140
As a British person, I find that
utterly incomprehensible.

244
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,330
If you look up "optimism"
in the O.E.D. and this is true,

245
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,150
the definition simply reads
"no".

246
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:50,240
For many in China, things
are going undeniably well.

247
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,240
Xi has even greater ambitions
and I'd like to focus

248
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,370
on two massive, signature projects,
one global and one domestic.

249
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,260
First, there's his so-called
"Belt and Road initiative",

250
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,300
a plan which is gigantic in scope.

251
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,380
It involves China spending a trillion
dollars on infrastructure projects

252
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,300
in more than 60 countries,
things like ports, bridges and roads,

253
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,290
with the idea that it could span
international land and sea routes

254
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:20,140
and reshape global trade
with China at its center.

255
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,270
It is the most ambitious infrastructure
project in modern history.

256
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:28,170
They've even produced
an English-language propaganda video

257
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,400
to tell the world about it.

258
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:33,330
When trade routes open up
that's when the sharing starts.

259
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,360
- Resources changing hands.
- And shipping auto parts.

260
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:41,320
Ideas start to flow
and friendships start to form.

261
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,390
Then things impossible
all become the norm.

262
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,330
The future's coming now...

263
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,270
The Belt and Road is how...

264
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:58,290
If I can just interrupt this irritating
Old Navy commercial

265
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,270
hawking a trillion-dollar
infrastructure plan.

266
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:05,320
You're probably thinking: "If I have
to listen to one more second of that,"

267
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,410
"it's gonna be stuck
in my head all week."

268
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:12,360
Just be thankful that you haven't
heard the rap break. Until now.

269
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,260
We trade in our wealth. We connect
with hearts. Strengthens our health.

270
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,350
Our lines and cables, diplomacy tables.
We'll share in a world of prosperity !

271
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,470
The future's coming now.

272
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,400
Okay, stop !
I can't take it any more, either.

273
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,990
They've basically
made Kommunist Kars 4 Kids.

274
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,850
That is unforgivable.

275
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:42,010
It's too early to say whether the Belt
and Road is going to be a success.

276
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,850
Xi's second bold project
has already seen results.

277
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,000
He's undertaken a massive
crackdown on political corruption,

278
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,850
a grievance
among Chinese citizens.

279
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,960
It's led to the punishment
of hundreds of thousands

280
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:58,830
of government officials,
some at the very top of the party.

281
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:03,930
State media even producing a
crackdown-themed computer game.

282
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,850
The "People's Daily"
a Communist Party mouthpiece,

283
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,930
released a computer game
where users can give electric shocks

284
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,050
to corrupt officials.

285
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:20,000
That's fun ! What could possibly
be sinister about being invited

286
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:23,060
to electrocute prisoners
in a government-issued game ?

287
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,920
The most entertaining way
to package something disturbing

288
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,030
since FDR's: "Candy Land, Kidding It's
Japanese-American Internment Camp."

289
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:37,730
This is where we reach the point
you kind of knew was coming.

290
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,710
Everything that I've shown you

291
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,690
is what Xi Dada wants
you to know about China.

292
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,700
There is a lot of troubling stuff
under the surface.

293
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,780
Conveniently for Xi, some of those
swept up in the corruption purge

294
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,720
were his political rivals.

295
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,850
And those accused were often
funneled into a system described

296
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,900
as "a secretive,
extralegal process"

297
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,890
where "interrogators seek to extract
confessions through torture."

298
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,880
Those term limits that
he successfully eliminated

299
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,810
were put in place for a good reason,
specifically, to avoid another Mao,

300
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,670
under whose regime some horrific
things happened in China,

301
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,680
from a collectivized farming attempt
responsible for 45 million deaths,

302
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,890
to a Cultural Revolution that
have killed at least another million,

303
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,830
to his belief that this swimsuit
was flattering.

304
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,740
Which I realize doesn't belong
with the other two in that list.

305
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:35,680
Xi is actively removing the post-Mao
guardrails that were put in place.

306
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,760
While China has never been known
as a haven for free expression,

307
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,820
he has clamped down noticeably
on any form of dissent whatsoever.

308
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,850
There is dissent online and China's
censors are working hard to quash it.

309
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,870
They temporarily banned the use

310
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,960
of phrases such as "personality cult"
and "my emperor"

311
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,860
and also references
to Winnie-the-Pooh,

312
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:01,880
a character used to mock Xi Jinping
based on an apparent resemblance.

313
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,740
It's true.

314
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:11,840
Xi Jinping is very sensitive about his
resemblance to Winnie-the-Pooh.

315
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,810
I'm not even sure it's that strong
a resemblance to be honest.

316
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:19,910
The fact he's annoyed means people
will never stop bringing it up.

317
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,770
Xi, if your face even remotely
resembles that of a cartoon character,

318
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,830
the smart move here
is to lean in.

319
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:34,780
Clamping down
on Winnie-the-Pooh comparisons

320
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,790
doesn't project strength, it suggests
a weird insecurity in him.

321
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:44,100
Experts say that Xi is concerned
public opinion will turn on him.

322
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,990
China's economy is already slowing
and Xi is haunted

323
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,940
by the specters of the Arab Spring
and the Soviet Union's collapse.

324
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,110
That paranoia is why he is anxious
to micromanage Chinese daily life.

325
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,960
The government has a list
of untrustworthy people,

326
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,160
which can restrict citizens' ability
to travel, buy a house

327
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,000
or take out loans.

328
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,150
Over the next years, there are
plans to take things much further.

329
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:12,180
Every Chinese citizen is
being assigned a social credit score.

330
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,950
A fluctuating rating based
on a range of behaviors.

331
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,950
Community service and buying
Chinese made products

332
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,050
can raise your score.

333
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:26,080
Fraud, tax evasion and smoking
in non-smoking areas can drop it.

334
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:30,010
If a score gets too low, a person
can be banned from buying

335
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:35,000
plane and train tickets, real estate,
cars and high-speed Internet.

336
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,140
You could be cut off
from high-speed internet.

337
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,960
That could be a huge opportunity
for the finest purveyors

338
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,230
of shitty, low-speed internet,
I'm talking, of course, about AT&amp;T,

339
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:49,230
one of America's least popular
corporations and also,

340
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,130
as of this week,
our parent company.

341
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,090
So, goodbye everyone !
It's been fun !

342
00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:00,260
It gets much darker here.
Xi's crackdown on human rights

343
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:04,140
is apparently "the most intense
since Tiananmen Square."

344
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:09,080
Tiananmen Square is on the short
list of places so infamous,

345
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,250
you don't even need to describe
what happened,

346
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,230
like Chernobyl or Jonestown,

347
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,080
or "that one Cheesecake Factory
we can't go to anymore."

348
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:22,040
Xi has intensified government
suppression of certain religions.

349
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:26,100
In one province, Christians "have been
told to take down the images of Jesus"

350
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,170
"and hang portraits of Xi instead."

351
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,180
Something I've also done.
See ?

352
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:34,140
I think it really ties the room
together, it's a nice accent piece.

353
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,240
A Muslim population known
as Uighurs have been singled out

354
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:42,040
for dystopian levels
of surveillance and persecution.

355
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,290
Here is one man talking about a form
the government had him fill out.

356
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,120
This piece of paper was sent to
everyone. People had to fill it out.

357
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,330
They ask if you are Uighur,
if you have a job,

358
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,130
if you have a passport,
if you pray.

359
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,150
These answers were turned
into a scoring system.

360
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:03,100
They would categorize people
into safe, regular and unsafe people.

361
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:06,110
That's pretty chilling.
generally speaking,

362
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:10,200
whenever people are placed on lists,
it's not turned out well.

363
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:13,290
Many of history's greatest
monsters put people on lists:

364
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:18,160
Nixon, the Nazis, Santa,
all of these animals did that.

365
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,300
If you are deemed "unsafe",
you're in big trouble.

366
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,260
China has incarcerated Muslims
in re-education camps,

367
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,100
with as many as 800 000 individuals
in facilities which reportedly aim

368
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,280
to rewire the political thinking
of detainees,

369
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,300
erase their Islamic beliefs
and reshape their very identities.

370
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:42,200
Making "Uncle Xi" less
like your fun uncle

371
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,620
and more like your creepy uncle who
imprisons 800 000 people in basement.

372
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:50,640
If you want to see what it looks
like when "Xi Jinping Thought"

373
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,710
gets put into "Xi Jinping practice",

374
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,540
take the story of Nobel Peace Prize
winner Liu Xiaobo.

375
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,530
He was imprisoned in 2009 for writing
a pro-democracy manifesto.

376
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,690
Last summer,
he died in state custody.

377
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,560
Even China seemed
concerned about how that might look.

378
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,560
Fearing domestic backlash,
government censors went to work.

379
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:13,610
Social media posts mentioning
Liu's name were deleted,

380
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,730
online searches with
his name were blocked,

381
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,650
candle emojis were deemed illegal
on some sites.

382
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,700
CNN's signal in China has been cut
by government censors

383
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,700
every time we mention his name.

384
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,690
The Chinese media
wouldn't allow mentions

385
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,540
of a Nobel Peace Prize
winner's name.

386
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,740
Which is a pretty intense
level of censorship,

387
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:37,610
but it's my personal policy towards
Guatemalan activist Rigoberta Menchú.

388
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:41,630
Do not bring her up around me.
She knows what she did.

389
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,650
You know what you did !

390
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:49,210
I don't want to hear her name !
That's not what this speech is about.

391
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,310
What happened
to Liu Xiaobo and his wife,

392
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:58,270
who is still under house arrest,
is absolutely tragic.

393
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,290
Although, he didn't go down
without taking a final swing.

394
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:07,150
One of the last known photos of Liu
was with his wife, Liu Xia.

395
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,170
At first glance unremarkable. But
notice the mugs they're holding.

396
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:16,270
That's Winnie-the-Pooh on.
Perhaps a final subtle act of defiance.

397
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,340
Yeah. Good for them.
I think deep down, we all know:

398
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,340
when you need to tell someone
to go fuck themselves,

399
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,100
why not do it with a mug.

400
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,100
Under Xi Jinping, China is becoming
more authoritarian,

401
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,110
just as it has major plans for
expansion onto the world stage.

402
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:45,240
The era of "hide and bide" is over.
Era of "do as we say" may be dawning.

403
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:47,840
China has significant
economic leverage

404
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,840
and it has been using
that to silence criticism,

405
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,660
even when criticism is warranted.

406
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:58,660
The European Union hardly squeaks
about human rights anymore,

407
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,760
the British don't.

408
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:05,800
You don't get much on Tibet either,
whenever anyone raises these issues,

409
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,680
China turns around and says:
"Wanna to do business or not ?"

410
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,780
China knows, no matter how badly
they behave,

411
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,740
the world will still want
to do business with them.

412
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,860
They're like Facebook.

413
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,790
You don't like us mining your data,
undercutting your democracy ?

414
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,840
What are you gonna do about it ?

415
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,790
Mail people printed out photos
of your meals ?

416
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:29,710
Call your friends and tell them
happy birthday in out loud words ?

417
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,720
I don't think so.
Go fuck yourself.

418
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,770
Here is where,
having set America aside at the start,

419
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,670
we should bring it back in.

420
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,730
It is more important than ever
that America be strategic

421
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,860
and tactical
about how to deal with China.

422
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,510
Those qualities
are not hallmarks of this guy,

423
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:53,490
who couldn't play chess for longer
than 29 seconds without screaming

424
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:57,580
"my horse eats your big lady"
and pouring nacho cheese on the board.

425
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,640
Trump is blowing up
the traditional alliances that helped

426
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,580
influence China's behavior
on important issues

427
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,620
and that has been
great news for Xi Jinping.

428
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:12,520
As has the fact that human rights don't
really seem to be a big Trump priority.

429
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:18,690
Hours after the death of Liu Xiaobo, as
his administration issued condolences,

430
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,460
Trump himself said this.

431
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,530
President Xi is a terrific guy.
I like being with him a lot.

432
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,660
And he's a very special person.

433
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:34,550
That was not the best time to give
Xi Jinping a pat on the back.

434
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,570
The equivalent of saying
how much you love Kevin Spacey

435
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,570
in "American Beauty",
right now.

436
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,640
First, you shouldn't.
It was objectively terrible.

437
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,680
You're picking the worst
possible time to bring that up.

438
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,540
Trump is leaving a vacuum
on the world stage

439
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,020
and China is more than happy to fill
it, by telling the world its story

440
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,830
and leaving out some
very important details.

441
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:02,840
If they're gonna send out cuddly
propaganda videos about Xi Jinping,

442
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,960
someone might make a companion
piece that rounds out the picture.

443
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,910
China's expanding now.
It's growing big and strong.

444
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,910
Let's learn about it now.
In this annoying song.

445
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:23,850
They have a president.
Some call him Uncle Xi.

446
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:27,920
- But he can fuck with you.
- It's an autocracy !

447
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:33,810
This is the China Xi...
Doesn't want you to see.

448
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:40,990
He'd rather shield from you,
The shitty things they do !

449
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,990
Compare him to this
and he'll get pissed.

450
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:48,970
You end up on untrustworthy list.
Jailing his foes alter what's true:

451
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,940
- My man Xi Jinping looks like.
- Winnie-the-Pooh !

452
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,630
This is the China Xi
Doesn't want you to see,

453
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:05,640
And that's the reason why,
You'd better watch this guy.

454
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,560
That's our show.
See you next week ! Good night !

455
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,660
Hi !

456
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:40,630
END OF EPISODE 15,
SEASON V
