HE'S A SUSPICIOUS GUY IS WHAT

84
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,100
I'M SAYING.

85
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,066

ALTHOUGH HE MAY ACTUALLY HAVE

90
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,834
HAD THE WORST WEEK OF ALL,

91
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:57,266
STARTING WITH THIS.

NO LONGER HAS ACCESS TO TOP

SECRET MATERIAL.

96
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:02,233
KUSHNER'S CLEARANCE LEVEL WAS

97
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:03,367
DOWNGRADED FROM TOP SECRET TO

98
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:05,967
SECRET.

99
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:06,867
>> EVEN THE WHITE HOUSE

CALLIGRAPHER NOW HAS A HIGHER

101
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,467
LEVEL OF CLEARANCE THAN KUSHNER

102
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:12,834
NOW DOES.

103
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:16,633
>> John: WOW!

104
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:17,433
THAT IS HUMILIATING.

105
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:18,133
ALTHOUGH IT KIND OF MAKES SENSE

106
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:19,066
THAT A CALLIGRAPHER HAS TO BE

107
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:24,533
GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS.

108
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:27,033
FOR EXAMPLE, THEY HAVE TO KEEP A

109
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:27,433
SECRET THAT

110
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:29,667
THERE'S A FONT IN MICROSOFT WORD

111
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:30,633
THAT DOES THEIR ENTIRE JOB.

112
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:31,500
WHAT'S CRAZY IS, KUSHNER HAS

113
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,266
REPORTEDLY BEEN ON INTERIM

114
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:33,000
SECURITY CLEARANCE EVER SINCE HE

115
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,834
JOINED THE WHITE HOUSE, AND

116
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:34,867
THAT'S FOR PRETTY GOOD REASONS.

117
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:35,934
>> JARED KUSHNER, IT'S NOT JUST

118
00:03:35,934 --> 00:03:37,133
HAS A COMPLICATED BUSINESS, HE

119
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,433
HAD TO CHANGE HIS FEDERAL

120
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:39,667
DISCLOSURE FORMS MULTIPLE TIMES

121
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:42,300
BECAUSE HE "INADVERTENTLY

122
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,266
OMITTED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

123
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,000
ASSETS AND FORGOT TO INCLUDE

124
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,233
MORE THAN 100 FOREIGN CONTACTS."

125

>> John: IN OTHER WORDS, KUSHNER

126
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,166
SCREWED UP SOME IMPORTANT

127
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,200
PAPERWORK, KEEPS CHANGING HIS

128
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,166
PERSONAL WEALTH, AND CASUALLY

129
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,500
OVERLOOKED HUNDREDS OF

130
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,567
FOREIGNERS.

131
00:03:58,567 --> 00:03:59,867
HE TRULY IS HIS FATHER-IN-LAW'S

132
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:01,000
SON.

133
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,266
THE ONLY REAL DIFFERENCE IS, ONE

134
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:03,567
OF THEM HAS ELECTRIFYING SEXUAL

135
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:04,934
CHEMISTRY WITH IVANKA TRUMP AND

136
00:04:04,934 --> 00:04:11,767
THE OTHER IS JARED KUSHNER.

137
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:13,200
NOW, JARED'S SECURITY ISSUE MAY

138
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,100
AFFECT HIS ABILITY TO TAKE AN

139
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,500
ACTIVE ROLE IN INTERNATIONAL

140
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,567

00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:18,600
ANOTHER STORY THAT CAME OUT THIS

142
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,567
WEEK, THAT MAY NOT BE THE WORST

143
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:21,066
THING.

144
00:04:21,066 --> 00:04:22,533
>> A REPORT IN

OFFICIALS FROM CHINA, ISRAEL,

147
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:26,433
MEXICO, AND THE

148
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,633
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES SAW KUSHNER

149
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:31,633
AS EXPLOITABLE AND AT ONE POINT

150
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:33,066
HOPED TO MANIPULATE HIM.

151
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:34,266
>> John: THE MOST SHOCKING THING

152
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:35,233
ABOUT THAT IS IF SOMEHOW ONLY

153
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,600
FOUR FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THOUGHT

154
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,567
THEY COULD MANIPULATE HIM.

155
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:41,300
HOW IS IT NOT MORE THAN THAT?

156
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,734
WHAT NATION LOOKED AT THIS MAN

157
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:45,300
AND THOUGHT, "FORGET IT,

158
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,200
HIS MIND IS A FORTRESS"?

159
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,533
HOW DID BOLIVIA, LAOS, OR

160
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:51,266
GERMANY NOT FEEL THAT THIS WAS A

161
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:53,533
CRACKABLE NUT?

162
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:54,934
COME ON, FRANCE, ICELAND,

163
00:04:54,934 --> 00:04:56,133
YOU DIDN'T THINK IT WAS EVEN

164
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:57,400
WORTH TRYING A LITTLE

165
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,800
NUDGE-NUDGE ON THE

166
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,200
OLD KUSH-BALL?

167
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,033
AND, LOOK, IT'S EASY TO GET

168
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:05,000
CAUGHT UP IN ALL THE DRAMA AND

169
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,867
FORGET THAT WHITE HOUSE CHAOS

170
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:06,734
CAN HAVE REAL-WORLD

171
00:05:06,734 --> 00:05:07,734
CONSEQUENCES, BUT THURSDAY

172
00:05:07,734 --> 00:05:08,800
BROUGHT A REMINDER OF THAT WHEN,

173
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,567
UNEXPECTEDLY, TRUMP ANNOUNCED

174
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:10,700
NEW TARIFFS ON STEEL AND

175
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,100
ALUMINUM.

176
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,200
AND WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH THAT

177
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,300
MOVE OR NOT, YOU HAVE TO BE

178
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,867
BOTHERED BY HOW IT HAPPENED.

179
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:18,400
>> SPOILING FOR A FIGHT, ANY

180
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,033
FIGHT, THE PRESIDENT DECIDED TO

181
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:21,700
PICK ONE ON TRADE, ANNOUNCING

182
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,567
NEW TARIFFS AGAINST THE ADVICE

183
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:25,000
OF MANY OF HIS TOP ADVISERS AND

184
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,333
WITHOUT ANY INTERNAL REVIEW,

185
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,700
TWEETING, "TRADE WARS ARE GOOD

186
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,633
AND EASY TO WIN."

187
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,533
>> John: YES, TRADE WARS ARE

188
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,633
GOOD AND EASY TO WIN, WHICH IS

189
00:05:36,633 --> 00:05:38,033
WEIRD, BECAUSE IF THAT WAS TRUE,

190
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:39,600
EVERYONE WOULD ALWAYS WIN THEM,

191
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,967
IN WHICH CASE THEY'D ACTUALLY BE

192
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:44,500
HARD TO WIN, BECAUSE EVERYONE

193
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,066
ELSE WOULD ALREADY HAVE WON

194
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:46,033
THEM.

195
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:47,600
IT'S A COMPLEX SITUATION

196
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,333
THAT PHILOSOPHERS REFER TO AS

197
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,066
"THE DIPSHIT'S CONUNDRUM."

198
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:57,900
NOW, SOME WERE IMMEDIATELY

199
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,367
SIGNIFICANTLY ALARMED

200
00:05:58,367 --> 00:05:59,667
THAT THIS COULD ACTUALLY

201
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:00,333
RAISE THE COST FOR AMERICANS ON

202
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:00,967
ANYTHING CONTAINING ALUMINUM OR

203
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:02,000
STEEL.

204
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,734
THAT'S WHY TRUMP SENT OUT HIS

205
00:06:02,734 --> 00:06:03,900
DYNAMIC SECRETARY OF COMMERCE,

206
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,467
WILBUR ROSS, TO ALLAY THOSE

207
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:05,266
FEARS IN THE DUMBEST WAY

208
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:06,667
POSSIBLE.

209
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,900
>> WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO,

210
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,800
THOUGH, IS TO EMPHASIZE AGAIN

211
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,367
THE LIMITED IMPACT.

212
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:14,967
THIS IS A CAN OF CAMPBELL'S

213
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:17,100
SOUP.

214
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,033
IN THE CAN OF CAMPBELL'S SOUP,

215
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:24,100
THERE'S ABOUT 2.6 CENTS,

216
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,567
2.6 PENNIES WORTH OF STEEL.

217
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:29,767
SO IF THAT GOES UP BY 25%,

218
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:31,967
THAT'S ABOUT 6/10 OF ONE CENT ON

219
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:32,834
THE PRICE OF A CAN OF CAMPBELL'S

220
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:37,400
SOUP.

221
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,567
>> John: GREAT POINT, WILBUR.

222
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:45,233
AND AS LONG AS THERE ISN'T

223
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:46,834
ANYTHING IN THE ECONOMY

224
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:47,567
THAT ISN'T SOUP, WE

225
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:48,500
SHOULD BE JUST FINE.

226
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,400
BUT DON'T WORRY.

227
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,367
OUR RESEARCHERS HAVE ACTUALLY

228
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,600
LOOKING INTO IT, AND IT TURNS

229
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,900
OUT, EVERYTHING IS SOUP.

230
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,300
SO WE'RE IN THE CLEAR.

231
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,200
OH, AND ONE MORE THING:

232
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,100
ONE MORE QUICK THING HERE.

233
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,867
HOW IS HE NOT MAGOO?

234
00:07:01,867 --> 00:07:04,367
THAT IS THE MAGOO-IEST SHIT I'VE

235
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:05,400
EVER SEEN RIGHT THERE.

236
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,567
AND IN DOING THIS, TRUMP MAY

237
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:07,633
WELL HAVE SET OFF A GLOBAL TRADE

238
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:08,967
WAR FOR NO GOOD REASON.

239
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:11,600
AND IF YOU NEED A SENSE OF JUST

240
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,500
HOW STUPID THIS MOVE IS, JUST

241
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,667
WATCH THE RESPONSE FROM E.U.

242
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,900
PRESIDENT JEAN CLAUDE JUNCKER,

243
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,834
WHO CANNOT BELIEVE HE IS NOW

244
00:07:16,834 --> 00:07:18,333
BEING FORCED TO ENGAGE IN THIS

245
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,567
SHIT.

246
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:21,700
>> SO NOW WE WILL ALSO IMPOSE

247
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,400
IMPORT TARIFFS.

248
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,567
THIS IS BASICALLY A STUPID

249
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:25,734
PROCESS, THE FACT THAT WE HAVE

250
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:26,900
TO DO THIS, BUT WE HAVE TO DO

251
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,033
IT.

252
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:29,567
WE WILL NOW IMPOSE TARIFFS ON

253
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:32,033
MOTORCYCLES, HARLEY DAVIDSON, ON

254
00:07:32,033 --> 00:07:33,967
BLUE JEANS, LEVIS, ON BOURBON.

255
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:36,266
WE CAN ALSO DO STUPID.

256
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:40,266
WE ALSO HAVE TO BE THIS STUPID.

257
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:41,767
>> John: OH, REALLY, JUNCKER?

258
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:43,233
YOU THINK YOU CAN BE AS STUPID

259
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:44,367
AS US?

260
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:45,734
PLEASE.

261
00:07:45,734 --> 00:07:48,266
YOU JUST BROUGHT A KNIFE TO A

262
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:50,633
GUN FIGHT, AND WE JUST BROUGHT A

263
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:52,467
HOT POCKET THAT WE PUT IN OUR

264
00:07:52,467 --> 00:07:54,433
GUN HOLSTER AND FORGOT WAS

265
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:54,633
THERE.

266
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:55,934
BECAUSE NO ONE OUT-STUPIDS

267
00:07:55,934 --> 00:08:01,200
DONALD TRUMP'S U.S. OF A!

268
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,367
NOBODY!

269
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:03,600
NOBODY!

270
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,633
YOU DON'T KNOW US!

271
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:07,900
AND NOW THIS.

272
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,734
>> AND NOW, WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE

273
00:08:10,734 --> 00:08:11,233
ON THE MAURY SHOW?

274
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:13,166
>> ARE YOU A MISTRESS WHO IS IN

275
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,166
LOVE WITH A MARRIED MAN AND

276
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:17,300
WANTS HIM TO CHOOSE FOR ONCE AND

277
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,834
FOR ALL, IF SO, CALL.

278
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:21,600
>> DO YOU SUSPECT HE IS USING

279
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,000
YOU FOR YOUR MONEY AND A PLACE

280
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,934
TO LIVE?

281
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:24,867
ARE YOU DOING A MUCH YOUNGER MAN

282
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:26,934
I DO SUSPECT HE IS CHEATING ON

283
00:08:26,934 --> 00:08:27,100
YOU?

284
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,333
>> IS YOUR FATHER DATING A MUCH

285
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:30,667
YOUNGER WOMAN?

286

BOYFRIEND OR HUSBAND IS CHEATING

288
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,333
ON HER?

289
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,200
>> ARE YOU CONVINCED HER MOTHER

290
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,066
IS HAVING SEX WITH YOUR HUSBAND?

291
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:41,233
>> IS THERE A POSSIBILITY OF TWO

292
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:43,433
OR MORE MEN BEING THE FATHER OF

293
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:43,734
YOUR CHILD?

THE MAN YOU THINK IS YOUR FATHER

CLAIMS HE IS NOT?

299
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,900
>> DOES YOUR CHILD LOOK LIKE

300
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,867
THEY BELONG TO ANOTHER RACE?

301
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:59,900
>> DID ANOTHER WOMAN'S HUSBAND

302
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,667
GET YOU PREGNANT?

303
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,567
>> ARE YOU A GRANDMOTHER WHO

304
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:03,834
LOVES WEARING REVEALING CLOTHING

305
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:07,000
AND IT IS DRIVING YOUR FAMILY

306
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,100
CRAZY?

307
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,333
>> John: OUR MAIN STORY

308
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:13,166
TONIGHT CONCERNS THE NRA.

309
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:13,967
A GROUP THAT FEELS

310
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:14,667
ABOUT GUNS THE WAY THE REST OF

311
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:15,367
US FEEL ABOUT NUTELLA:

312
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:16,166
A LITTLE IS GOOD.

313
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:16,867
MORE IS BETTER.

314
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:18,233
AND YOU CAN TELL ME IT'S BAD FOR

315
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:18,934
ME ALL YOU LIKE, BUT YOU CAN PRY

316
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,400
IT FROM MY COLD, DEAD HANDS.

317
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
IN THE WAKE OF THE PARKLAND

318
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
SHOOTING, THE NRA HAS FOUND

319
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,133
THEMSELVES IN THE SPOTLIGHT ONCE

320
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:24,266
MORE.

321
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:29,100
HOWEVER, THE PUBLIC PRESSURE

322
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,867
THIS TIME IS ACTUALLY STARTING

323
00:09:31,867 --> 00:09:32,233
TO TAKE A TOLL.

324
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:32,900
>> TWITTER USERS ARE PRESSURING

325
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,633
COMPANIES AFFILIATED WITH THE

326
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:34,533
GUN RIGHTS GROUP BY USING THE

327
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,500
HASHTAG #BoycottNRA.

328
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,734
>> SO 15 COMPANIES HAVE CUT TIES

329
00:09:38,734 --> 00:09:39,633
WITH THE NRA AFTER PARKLAND.

330
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:40,367
I THINK WE HAVE A LIST OF THEM

331
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:41,066
HERE, SOME BIG ONES.

332
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:42,500
DELTA, UNITED, AVIS, BUDGET,

333
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,667
HERTZ.

334
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:47,300
BASICALLY SAYING THERE ARE NO

335
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:47,800
LONGER GOING TO PROVIDE

336
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,367
DISCOUNTS TO THE NRA.

337
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:50,367
>> John: YES, AVIS, BUDGET, AND

338
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:52,467
HERTZ WILL ALL STOP PROVIDING

339
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:55,667
DISCOUNTS TO NRA MEMBERS, WHICH

340
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:58,100
WILL PRESUMABLY COME AS A HUGE

341
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,266
BLOW

342
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:00,100
TO JEREMY, THE ONE NRA MEMBER

343
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,400
WHO WAS JUST IN IT FOR THE

344
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,367
RENTAL CARS.

345
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:04,133
BUT THE BOYCOTT TRAIN HIT A SNAG

346
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:04,867
WHEN IT RAN INTO ONE OF THE

347
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:05,734
NRA'S LESSER-KNOWN SIDE

348
00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:06,700
VENTURES.

349
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,033
>> ONE GROUP THAT HAS NOT BEEN

350
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:10,166
SWAYED YET, BIG TECH COMPANIES

351
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:14,266
LIKE APPLE, AMAZON, AND ROKU.

352
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:15,567
YOU SEE, THESE COMPANIES'

353
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:16,200
STREAMING SERVICES STILL OFFER

354
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,133
ACCESS TO NRATV, THE GUN LOBBY

355
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:18,934
GROUP'S FREE ONLINE CHANNEL

356
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:22,834
FOCUSED ON PRO-GUN CONTENT.

357
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:24,100
>> John: OKAY, SO THAT IS AN

358
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,767
UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION FOR

359
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:26,433
APPLE AND AMAZON, BUT IT'S A

360
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:27,033
FUCKING MIRACLE FOR ROKU.

361
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:28,033
"HARRY!

362
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:31,834
HARRY, GET IN HERE!

363
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:32,767
SOMEONE JUST CALLED US A

364
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:33,867
'BIG TECH COMPANY.'

365
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:34,667
THEY SAID 'LIKE AMAZON AND

366
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:35,633
APPLE.'

367
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:37,033
IT'S HAPPENING, HARRY!

368
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:40,266
IT'S HAPPENING!"

369
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:43,166
BUT WITH ALL THE DISCUSSION THIS

370
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,367
WEEK OF BOYCOTTING NRATV, WE

371
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:46,133
THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE WORTH

372
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:47,333
ANSWERING THE QUESTION,

373
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:52,233
"WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?"

374
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:53,133

ASSASSINATE REAL NEWS.

385
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:07,667

THEY MAKE SHOWS,

IT'S ARTWORK.

521
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,700

532
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,667
IN FACT, THE ONLY WAY HE COULD

533

LOVE THEM ANY MORE IS IF,

534

INSTEAD OF BULLETS, EVERY GUN

535
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:15,867
JUST FIRED A BUNCH OF LITTLE

536
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:22,567
BUNCH OF EVEN SMALLER GUNS

537
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:23,433

YOU'RE ACTUALLY IN A SPECIFIC

561
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,667
UNIFORM WITH SPECIFIC KIT, CAN

562
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:51,433
YOU SHOOT, MOVE, COMMUNICATE

563
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:55,266
WITH THAT AMOUNT OF WEIGHT AND

564
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:56,100
DO DOWN-MAN DRILLS?

565
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,333
THAT'S THE KEY THING HERE.

566
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,533
>> John: I'D LOVE TO SEE A BANK

567
00:15:58,533 --> 00:15:59,467
ROBBER TRY TO USE THAT DEFENSE

568
00:15:59,467 --> 00:16:01,767
IN COURT.

569
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:03,667
"YOUR HONOR, I REALLY FEEL WE

570
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05,066
NEED TO GET PAST THE FACT THAT

571
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:06,934
WE WERE ROBBING A BANK, AND

572
00:16:06,934 --> 00:16:08,500
INSTEAD FOCUS ON HOW WELL WE

573
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,066
WERE SHOOTING, MOVING, AND

574
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:09,767
COMMUNICATING."

575
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:10,967
AND THE ENDEARING THING ABOUT

576
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:11,533
DOM RASO IS THAT HIS SHOW'S

577
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:12,133
RE-ENACTMENTS DON'T ALWAYS GO

578
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:12,800
SMOOTHLY.

579
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,567
FOR INSTANCE, HOW DID HIS

580
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,700
RE-ENACTMENT OF THE "HEAT"

581
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,834
ROBBERY GO?

582
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:16,667
>> THEY MAKE IT LOOK EASY, THE

583
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:17,800
WAY THEY'RE MOVING.

584
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,166
>> YEAH, THIS BAG, AS I WAS

585
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,567
RUNNING, WAS JUST HITTING AT THE

586
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:21,500
BACK OF MY KNEES, HAVE TAKEN MY

587
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,400
LEGS OUT FROM UNDERNEATH ME.

588
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,667
DEFINITELY FATIGUED ME.

589
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:25,066
>> MY STRAP BROKE.

590
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:26,300
SO I WAS HOLDING IT LIKE THIS

591
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,467
THE ENTIRE TIME, WOBBLING BACK

592
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:28,300
AND FORTH, EVEN IN THE

593
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,233
BEGINNING.

594
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:30,433
COULDN'T GET A STABLE SHOOTING

595
00:16:30,433 --> 00:16:30,867
PLATFORM.

596
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:31,800
I MEAN, WE WORKED IT OUT.

597
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
I HAD TO LOWER MY CENTER OF

598
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,767
GRAVITY MORE SO THE BAG COULDN'T

599
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:35,166
CONTROL ME.

600
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:35,967
WE DEFINITELY PROVED THAT THEY

601
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:36,700
DIDN'T HAVE ANY WEIGHT IN THERE

602
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,033
WHILE THEY WERE SHOOTING AND

603
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:39,200
MOVING.

604
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,300
>> John: WOW.

605
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,300
THAT IS GENUINELY INSPIRING.

606
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,533
BECAUSE SOMEWHERE OUT THERE,

607
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:46,467
THERE'S AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD

608
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:47,233
ASSHOLE WATCHING

609
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:48,133
THAT SHOW AND THINKING,

610
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:48,800
"OH, GOOD, BEING AN ADULT IS

611
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,633
LITERALLY EXACTLY HOW I IMAGINED

612
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,533
IT."

613
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:51,400
HONESTLY, I COULD TALK ABOUT

614
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,033
DOM RASO ALL NIGHT, BUT BEFORE

615
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:54,266
WE MOVE ON, I HAVE TO SHOW YOU

616
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:56,900
HIS INEXPLICABLE RESPONSE TO A

617
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,834
VIEWER-SUBMITTED QUESTION.

618
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:00,967
>> WHAT IS YOUR MOST TREASURED

619
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:02,800
POSSESSION?

620
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,734
>> I WOULD SAY, MY AUNT GAVE ME

621
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:05,600
A CROSS THAT WAS MADE OUT OF

622
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,000
BONES.

623
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,967
SHE'S LIKE, YOUR

624
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:09,367
GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER GAVE

625
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:10,700
THAT TO ME TO PASS DOWN TO

626
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,233
SOMEBODY SPECIAL IN THE FAMILY,

627
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:13,233
BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY MADE OUT OF

628
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,567
HUMAN BONE AND HE CARVED IT WHEN

629
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:15,767
HE WAS A PRISONER OF WAR AND

630
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:16,834
THAT HAS BEEN PASSED DOWN IN THE

631
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:18,200
FAMILY.

632
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,567
NOW I'M LIKE, ARE YOU SERIOUS?

633
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:20,867
I'M LIKE, THAT JUST DOESN'T

634
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:21,100
EXIST.

635
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:21,934
SO THAT'S PROBABLY BY FAR THE

636
00:17:21,934 --> 00:17:25,300
COOLEST THING THAT I HAVE.

637
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,967
>> John: WELL, THAT'S A HELL OF

638
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:29,900
A STORY THERE, DOM.

639
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,166
AND I JUST DON'T KNOW OF ANY

640
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:31,767
BETTER POSTER BOY FOR THE NRA

641
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:32,834
THAN SOMEONE WHO RE-ENACTS BANK

642
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:33,633
ROBBERIES FOR FUN AND WHOSE MOST

643
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:34,533
TREASURED POSSESSION IS A CROSS

644
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:40,200
MADE OUT OF HUMAN BONES.

645
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,000
BUT, LOOK, NRATV ISN'T ALL GUN

646
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,934
BROS.

647
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:42,834
THERE'S ALSO A LARGE AMOUNT OF

648
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:43,667
CONTENT EXPLICITLY AIMED AT

649
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:44,367
WOMEN.

650
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:45,400
THERE'S EVEN A WHOLE WOMEN'S

651
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
CHANNEL FEATURING SHOWS LIKE

652
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,667
"ARMED AND FABULOUS."

653
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:51,700
THE NRA IS ACTUALLY MAKING A BIG

654
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,200
PUSH FOR WOMEN, AND THEY'RE

655
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,934
PRETTY CLEAR ABOUT THEIR

656
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:54,934
MOTIVATIONS.

657
00:17:54,934 --> 00:17:55,834
>> WOMEN REALLY HAVE AN

658
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:56,700
INCREDIBLE ROLE RIGHT NOW IN THE

659
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,633
NRA.

660
00:18:00,633 --> 00:18:02,033
THEY ARE EXCITED.

661
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:02,967
THEY ARE ENTHUSIASTIC.

662
00:18:02,967 --> 00:18:03,500
THEY ARE THERE FOR US AND

663
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,133
THAT'S --

664
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:05,000
YOU KNOW, IF YOU GET THE

665
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,166
WOMAN, YOU GET THE FAMILY.

666
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,100
>> John: "IF YOU GET THE WOMAN,

667
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,266
YOU GET THE FAMILY."

668
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:09,333
THAT IS A BRAZENLY TRANSPARENT

669
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,333
STATEMENT OF YOUR MARKETING

670
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,700
STRATEGY.

671
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,433
BUT TO BE HONEST,

672
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:17,500
CAN WE JUST GO BACK TO THAT ROOM

673
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,433
FOR A SECOND?

674
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:19,500
DO YOU FIND THAT ROOM RELAXING?

675
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,200
IS THAT A SOOTHING SPACE FOR

676
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,900
YOU?

677
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,333
BECAUSE I WOULD BE A LITTLE

678
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:24,967
DISTURBED BY THE EXTENDED FAMILY

679
00:18:24,967 --> 00:18:25,867
OF GAZELLES SCREAMING "WHY?" AT

680
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:27,867
ME WITH THEIR DEAD, GLASSY EYES.

681
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:29,033
NOW, ONE OF THE NRA'S

682
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:30,767
FEMALE-FOCUSED PROGRAMS,

683
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:33,500
"LOVE AT FIRST SHOT," IS

684
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,633
EXPLICITLY ABOUT GETTING WOMEN

685
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:36,367
MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA

686
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:37,667
OF OWNING OR FIRING GUNS, AND IN

687
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:40,500
ONE EPISODE, THEY TOOK A WOMAN

688
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,834
WHO WAS NERVOUS ABOUT FIREARMS

689
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:42,800
AND REALLY THREW HER IN AT THE

690
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,567
DEEP END.

691
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:45,934
>> WE'RE GOING TO GO STRAIGHT

692
00:18:45,934 --> 00:18:47,233
INTO RIFLES, AND WE'RE GOING TO

693
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:51,700
DO IT WITH AN AR-15.

694
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,467
>> OKAY.

695
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:55,734
>> I KNOW YOU PROBABLY HEARD

696
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:56,266
ABOUT THEM ON THE NEWS AND

697
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:57,033
EVERYTHING ELSE.

698
00:18:57,967 --> 00:18:59,000
>> I HIT THE TARGET.

699
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,734
>> YOU DID.

700
00:18:59,734 --> 00:19:00,433
HOW DID IT FEEL?

701
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:01,233
>> NOT AS SCARY AS I THINK I WAS

702
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:02,066
ANTICIPATING.

703
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:02,834
>> EXACTLY.

704
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:03,867
IT'S JUST THIS NICE LIGHT POOF

705
00:19:03,867 --> 00:19:05,367
OF HAPPINESS.

706
00:19:05,367 --> 00:19:07,367
>> YEAH, YEAH.

707
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:08,533
>> John: "A LIGHT POOF OF

708
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:11,033
HAPPINESS."

709
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:13,033
IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD TO DESCRIBE

710
00:19:13,033 --> 00:19:14,433
A SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLE THE WAY

711
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:16,166
BOB ROSS DESCRIBES

712
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:19,133
A FUCKING CLOUD.

713
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:20,600
BUT ONCE "LOVE AT FIRST SHOT"

714
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,567
HAS WOMEN HOOKED, THE UPSELLING

715
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:22,867
BEGINS, WHICH ACTUALLY MAKES

716
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:23,867
SENSE.

717
00:19:23,867 --> 00:19:25,633
INDUSTRY RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT

718
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:26,567
WOMEN WILL SPEND HUNDREDS OF

719
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:27,467
DOLLARS ON ACCESSORIES IN

720
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,266
ADDITION TO THEIR GUNS.

721
00:19:29,266 --> 00:19:30,700
SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY

722
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,734
"LOVE AT FIRST SHOT" FUNCTIONS

723
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:34,934
AS A KIND OF QVC FOR FIREARMS,

724
00:19:34,934 --> 00:19:36,834
SHOWCASING PRODUCTS LIKE

725
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:38,300
MAG LOADERS, TARGETS, GUN CASES,

726
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,934
AND HANDBAGS.

727
00:19:40,934 --> 00:19:42,667
>> OKAY, SO, AS YOU SEE HERE,

728
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:44,133
I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT

729
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:46,333
STYLE OPTIONS FOR YOU.

730
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,600
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

731
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,033
VARIETIES OF EXTERIORS, BUT A

732
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:50,066
LOT OF THEM REALLY HAVE THE SAME

733
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:51,033
STRUCTURE IN TERMS OF CONCEAL

734
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:53,166
CARRY.

735
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,000
>> I NEVER WOULD'VE IMAGINED

736
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,100
THESE LITTLE NEAT POCKETS AND

737
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,133
HIDDEN CLOSURES.

738
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:57,567
KNOWING THAT YOU CAN CLOSE IT,

739
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,700
IT DOES PUT MY MIND AT EASE WITH

740
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,934
IT, SO IT'S PRETTY COOL.

741
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,100
>> John: GIRL, YOU DON'T EVEN

742
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,300
NEED A GUN BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE

743
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,700
GOING TO DIE WHEN THEY SEE

744
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:14,033
THAT BAG.

745
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:16,433
AND, LOOK, IT'S NOT JUST

746
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:17,400
HANDBAGS.

747
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,033
EVEN THE GUN ITSELF CAN BE

748
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:19,266
PROFITABLY ACCESSORIZED.

749
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:19,867
>> SO YES, WE DO HAVE A CUSTOM

750
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:21,033
LINE OF GUN PAINT FOR THE LADIES

751
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:21,500
OUT THERE.

752
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,233
THESE MAGS LOOK PHENOMENAL.

753
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:23,433
I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, IT'S SO

754
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:24,567
MUCH FUN TO WORK WITH, AND IT'S

755
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:26,000
GREAT TO BE ABLE TO PUT YOUR

756
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,867
PERSONAL TOUCH ON YOUR FIREARMS

757
00:20:26,867 --> 00:20:29,066
AND YOUR ACCESSORIES.

758
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:32,800
>> John: OH, THAT'S SO FUN!

759
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,467
THAT IS SO FUN!

760
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,000
OR, IF NATALIE EVER COMMITS

761
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,367
MURDER, A GRAVE OVERSIGHT.

762
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:38,300
"GOOD NEWS, CHIEF.

763
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,100
THE MAG SAYS THE KILLER'S NAME

764
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,100
RIGHT ON IT.

765
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,934
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT MOTIVATED HER

766
00:20:40,934 --> 00:20:42,066
TO GO ON A KILLING SPREE, BUT WE

767
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:43,467
DO KNOW SHE HAD A LOT OF FUN

768
00:20:43,467 --> 00:20:45,500
WITH IT."

769
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,033
WE'VE WATCHED EVERY SINGLE

770
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:48,266
EPISODE OF "LOVE AT FIRST SHOT,"

771
00:20:48,266 --> 00:20:49,400
AND I HAVE TO SHOW YOU OUR

772
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
FAVORITE CLIP.

773
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,967
IT'S FROM SEASON 2, EPISODE 1.

774
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:54,000
THE HOST, NATALIE, IS PREGNANT

775
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,033
AT THIS POINT, SO SHE CAN'T JOIN

776
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:56,700
IN ON THE SHOOTING, BUT THAT

777
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,700
DOESN'T MEAN THEY DIDN'T FIND A

778
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,033
WAY TO GET HER INVOLVED.

779
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:02,567
>> WE ARE GOING TO MAKE ART FOR

780
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:03,433
NATALIE SINCE SHE COULDN'T BE ON

781
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:06,066
THE RANGE WITH US.

782
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:07,433
>> AW.

783
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,633
>> WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING

784
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:09,233
SPECIAL FOR HER TO HANG IN HER

785
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:10,133
BABY NURSERY.

786
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:11,166
>> YEAH!

787
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,200
THAT'S SO COOL!

788
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,166
>> THERE WE GO!

789
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,300
TWO FOR ONE!

790
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,100
>> TWO FOR ONE!

791
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,734
>> WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE

792
00:21:18,734 --> 00:21:19,400
EXPECTING, OBVIOUSLY, SO WE

793
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,633
THOUGHT WE WOULD MAKE A LITTLE

794
00:21:21,633 --> 00:21:22,400
SOMETHING FOR THE BABY'S

795
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,600
NURSERY.

796
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,033
>> OH, BECAUSE YOU KNOW --

797
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:25,867
OH, YOU GUYS.

798
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:30,233
>> WE SHOT PAINT.

799
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:31,700
>> John: YEAH, THEY SHOT PAINT.

800
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,367
SO WHEN SOMEBODY INEVITABLY ASKS

801
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:33,333
WHY YOU HAVE WHAT APPEARS TO BE

802
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,667
A BLANK CANVAS WITH A LARGE

803
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:35,667
BLOODSTAIN HANGING UP IN YOUR

804
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:36,934
CHILD'S NURSERY, YOU'LL BE ABLE

805
00:21:36,934 --> 00:21:37,900
TO COMPLETELY REASSURE THEM BY

806
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,400
SAYING, "OH, YEAH, MY FRIEND

807
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,300
SHOT THAT FOR ME."

808
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,633
BUT IT'S NOT ALL FUN WITH GUNS.

809
00:21:44,633 --> 00:21:45,934
WHERE NRATV REALLY COMES INTO

810
00:21:45,934 --> 00:21:46,800
ITS OWN IS WHEN ITS TONE GETS

811
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,433
MUCH DARKER.

812
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,100
WHICH IT DOES.

813
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,800
FOR INSTANCE, THEY HAVE A SERIES

814
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,767
OF HUNTING VIDEOS, WHICH

815
00:21:52,767 --> 00:22:00,567
SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISING.

816
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:01,100
IN FACT, IT MAKES COMPLETE

817
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,700
SENSE.

818
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,433
PEOPLE DO USE GUNS WHEN THEY

819
00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:03,200
HUNT.

820
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,900
BUT WHILE THE VISUALS ARE

821
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,700
PREDICTABLE BEAUTY SHOTS OF

822
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,667
NATURE, THE VOICEOVER TAKES A

823
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:06,500
DIFFERENT PATH.

824
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,066
>> SOMEWHERE OVER THIS HORIZON

825
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:09,300
SIT A MILLION LITTLE DICTATORS

826
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,567
EAGER TO PURGE HUMANITY OF ITS

827
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:15,266
HUNTING INSTINCTS.

828
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:17,767
THE ANTI-HUNTERS HAVE IMPOSED A

829
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:19,800
FALSE ORDER ON THEIR LIVES BASED

830
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,233
ON A MISCONCEIVED PERCEPTION OF

831
00:22:22,233 --> 00:22:25,600
THE WORLD.

832
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,033
DEATH IS EVIL, THEY BELIEVE, AND

833
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:29,100
SO THE PURVEYOR OF DEATH MUST

834
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,333
ALSO BE EVIL.

835
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:32,633
DEATH IS AN UNDENIABLE FUEL OF

836
00:22:32,633 --> 00:22:37,633
LIFE.

837
00:22:37,633 --> 00:22:39,700
>> John: OH, MY GOD.

838
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,667
THAT IS LESS "PLANET EARTH" AND

839
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:41,333
MORE "DERANGED LETTER FROM A

840
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,333
SERIAL KILLER."

841
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:43,467
ALTHOUGH, TO BE HONEST, I'D

842
00:22:43,467 --> 00:22:44,567
RESPECT THE NRA MORE IF ITS

843
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:45,400
SLOGAN WERE JUST "THE NRA:

844
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,667
BECAUSE DEATH IS AN UNDENIABLE

845
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:48,200
FUEL OF LIFE."

846
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,300
I WOULDN'T LIKE IT, BUT AT LEAST

847
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,633
WE'D BE CLEAR WHERE THEY WERE

848
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:52,767
COMING FROM.

849
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:56,200
AND THAT FLOWERY,

850
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,166
VAGUELY THREATENING TONE IS A

851
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,500
KEY FEATURE OF NRATV.

852
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,066
HERE'S ANOTHER WEIRD EXAMPLE.

853
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:01,467
>> HIDDEN BENEATH THE DENSE

854
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:03,100
CANOPY OF DECIDUOUS TREES IS A

855
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,567
PROSTITUTE OF SORTS, AND THOSE

856
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:06,133
WHO PROFIT BY SELLING HER WILL

857
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:08,100
STOP AT NOTHING TO EXPLOIT HER.

858
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,367
SOLD AND PROMOTED FOR HER

859
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:11,433
NON-ADDICTIVE, EVEN MEDICINAL

860
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:13,066
ADVANTAGES, WHAT LIES BEHIND THE

861
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:14,567
VEIL OF THIS SEDUCTRESS IS FAR

862
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:15,800
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT SHE FIRST

863
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,100
APPEARS TO BE.

864
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,300
SHE IS A HARLOT, AND HER NAME IS

865
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:25,633
MARY JANE.

866
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:27,100
>> John: I DIDN'T THINK THIS WAS

867
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,533
POSSIBLE, BUT I THINK THAT GUY

868
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:31,600
JUST SLUT-SHAMED MARIJUANA.

869
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,767
"AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON

870
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:35,500
MUSHROOMS, THOSE FILTHY TRAMPS.

871
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,100
THEY'LL GROW NEXT TO ANY TREE AT

872
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,166
ALL.

873
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,900
WHORES WITH SPORES, THAT'S WHAT

874
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,633
I CALL 'EM."

875
00:23:42,633 --> 00:23:44,333
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHY

876
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:47,700
NRATV IS EVEN TALKING ABOUT

877
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,734
DRUGS AT ALL, THE FINAL

878
00:23:48,734 --> 00:23:49,734
DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC OF THE

879
00:23:49,734 --> 00:23:51,800
NETWORK IS PAINTING A BLEAK

880
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,700
VISION OF AMERICA WITH THREATS

881
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,900
AROUND EVERY SINGLE CORNER AND

882
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,500
ONE SOLUTION.

883
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,800
>> THE NEXT ATTACK ON OUR SOIL

884
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,166
COULD COME IN A MATTER OF

885
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:00,300
MINUTES.

886
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,567
>> TEENAGE GIRLS ARE TRAFFICKED

887
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:03,767
IN SEX TRADE.

888

SYMPATHIZERS.

00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:11,834
MAY CALL 911, AND THERE MAY BE

893
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:13,033
NOBODY ON THE OTHER LINE.

894
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:14,667

895
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:16,033
HUMAN TRAFFICKERS WHO HAVE

00:24:16,033 --> 00:24:17,633
INVADED OUR BORDERS AND EMBEDDED

897
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:19,600
IN EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN CITY.

898
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,467
>> THIS THREAT IS REAL.

899
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:24,734
OUR LEADERS ARE EITHER INCAPABLE

900

OF OR UNWILLING TO PROTECT YOU,

EFFECTIVE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO

903
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,166
PROTECT YOURSELF AND YOUR

>> John: HOLY SHIT.

906
00:24:34,867 --> 00:24:36,667
THEY'RE USING THE SAME

907
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:38,934
TECHNIQUES AS AN INFOMERCIAL.

908

DOWN?

DO YOU HAVE ISIS SYMPATHIZERS IN

THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY!

NEAR YOU."

917
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,333
NOW, TO WATCH NRATV IS TO WATCH

918
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,467
A CONSTANT STREAM OF STORIES

919
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:02,367
LIKE THOSE -- MANY REAL, BUT

920
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:03,200
AMPLIFIED TO TERRIFY YOU AND

921
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,133
SELL YOU PRODUCTS.

922
00:25:04,133 --> 00:25:05,100
AND THERE MAY BE A GOOD REASON

923
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,734
IT SOUNDS LIKE AN INFOMERCIAL --

924
00:25:07,734 --> 00:25:10,834
BECAUSE IT IS.

925
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:12,166
MANY OF NRATV'S SHOWS ARE

926
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:13,433
SPONSORED BY GUN BRANDS LIKE

927
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:14,200
SMITH & WESSON.

928
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,033
AND BEHIND THE SCENES OF NRATV

929
00:25:15,033 --> 00:25:22,133
IS AN AD AGENCY.

930
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:22,834
IT'S CALLED ACKERMAN McQUEEN.

931
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:24,734
THEY'VE WORKED WITH THE NRA FOR

932
00:25:24,734 --> 00:25:27,967
DECADES, AND THE

933
00:25:27,967 --> 00:25:30,000
ACKERMAN McQUEEN WEBSITE

934
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,533
PROCLAIMS, "EVERY BRAND MUST BE

935
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:33,133
ITS OWN MEDIA COMPANY."

936
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:33,834
AND THAT'S WHAT THE NRA HAVE

937
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:34,500
DONE WITH THEIR TV ARM.

938
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
THEY'VE GOT A PRODUCT TO SELL,

939
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,100
AND THEY EMPLOY PEOPLE WHO CAN

940
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:36,867
SELL THAT PRODUCT.

941
00:25:36,867 --> 00:25:37,600
EVEN DANA LOESCH, THE CLENCHED

942
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,767

SINGLE AMERICAN CITY, IS SELLING

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,667
>> HI, I'M DANA LOESCH FROM

948
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:47,934
"THE DANA SHOW."

949
00:25:47,934 --> 00:25:48,867
THERE'S ONE SUPERFOOD I DRINK

950
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:49,767
EVERY DAY FOR HEALTHY

951
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:50,800
CIRCULATION AND TO MAKE ME FEEL

952
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,233
GREAT ALL DAY LONG.

953
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:55,367
IT'S CALLED SUPERBEETS, AND YOU

954
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:56,633
CAN TRY IT FOR YOURSELF

955
00:25:56,633 --> 00:25:57,967
RISK FREE.

956
00:25:57,967 --> 00:25:59,233
I TAKE SUPERBEETS AS MY

957
00:25:59,233 --> 00:26:00,433
PRE-WORKOUT IN THE MORNING AND

958
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,400
AS A NON-JITTERY PICK-ME-UP IN

959
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,633
THE AFTERNOON.

960
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:03,667
AND JUST ONE TEASPOON OF

961
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:05,166
SUPERBEETS GIVES YOU THE BENEFIT

962
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:06,767
OF THREE WHOLE BEETS.

963
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:08,767
>> John: WOW, DANA.

964
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,800
THREE WHOLE BEETS.

965
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,367
THAT'S MORE THAN MY DELICIOUS

966
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:15,400
SUPERFOOD, "MEDIUM BEETS."

967
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,767
IT GIVES YOU THE BENEFITS OF TWO

968
00:26:16,767 --> 00:26:18,600
WHOLE BEETS, WHICH IS, AND THIS

969
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,734
IS TRUE, ENOUGH.

970
00:26:20,734 --> 00:26:23,100
THAT'S A PERFECTLY ADEQUATE

971
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:29,467
NUMBER OF BEETS.

972
00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:31,867
THE WHOLE POINT HERE IS,

973
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:34,967
THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION

974
00:26:34,967 --> 00:26:37,900
"WHAT THE FUCK IS NRATV?"

975
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,934
IS, "IT'S JUST A VESSEL

976
00:26:38,934 --> 00:26:39,533
TO SELL AMERICA GUNS."

977
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:40,333
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.

978
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:41,100
DOES IT WORK?

979
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:41,667
IT'S HARD TO SAY.

980
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:42,667
THEY WON'T REVEAL THEIR RATINGS,

981
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:43,333
SO IT'S PLAUSIBLE THAT NO ONE IS

982
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:47,700
WATCHING THIS AND THAT AD

983
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,667
AGENCY, ACKERMAN McQUEEN, ARE

984
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:49,200
MAKING OUT LIKE BANDITS.

985
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,166
HAVING WATCHED A SHITLOAD OF

986
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:54,066
NRATV'S PROGRAMMING, HERE'S WHAT

987
00:26:54,066 --> 00:26:54,834
I'LL SAY ABOUT IT.

988
00:26:54,834 --> 00:26:55,767
THERE IS A LOT TO BE CONCERNED

989
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:56,867
ABOUT REGARDING THE NRA'S

990
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:57,967
ACTIVITIES, BUT NRATV MIGHT

991
00:26:57,967 --> 00:26:58,633
ACTUALLY BE THE DUMBEST, MOST

992
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:00,734
TRANSPARENT THING IT DOES.

993
00:27:00,734 --> 00:27:02,233
THINK OF IT THIS WAY.

994
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:04,567
IF THE NRA IS A FEROCIOUS BEAR

995
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:06,667
CHARGING AT YOU, NRATV IS

996
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,834
THAT BEAR'S RIDICULOUS HAT.

997
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:09,800
IS IT EYE-CATCHING?

998
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,333
SURE.

999
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:13,734
IS IT PERVERSELY ENTERTAINING?

1000
00:27:13,734 --> 00:27:14,934
ABSOLUTELY.

1001
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:15,967
IS IT THE MAIN THING YOU SHOULD

1002
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:16,934
BE WORRIED ABOUT?

1003
00:27:16,934 --> 00:27:20,633
PROBABLY NOT.

1004
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:22,400
BECAUSE THE REAL TRUTH HERE IS,

1005
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,166
HAT OR NO HAT, IT IS IMPERATIVE

1006
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:25,767
THAT EVERYONE KEEP THEIR EYES ON

1007
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:27,300
THAT FUCKING BEAR.

1008
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,667
AND NOW THIS.

1009
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:31,133
>> AND NOW PROOF THAT NRATV'S

1010
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:33,000
TONE CAN MAKE ANYTHING SEEM

1011
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,133
SCARY.

1012
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:41,400
>> HAS YOUR KITCHEN THAT ONCE

1013
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,533
GLEAMED IN THE SOFT GLOW OF DAWN

1014
00:27:42,533 --> 00:27:51,900
NOW BECOME A LOG OF COUNTERTOPS?

1015
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,266
SHE IS THE OVEN'S CONTEMPTIBLE

1016
00:27:56,266 --> 00:28:00,000
WHORE, AND HER NAME IS MUFFINS.

1017
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,100
THE MUFFINS GLUTINOUS PRISON,

1018
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,266
EACH A FOOD SLAVE IN ITS CRUSTY

1019
00:28:06,266 --> 00:28:07,133
WALLS.

1020
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:08,667
AMERICANS ONCE RELISHED OUR

1021
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:09,567
RIGHT TO A STACK OF FLAPJACKS

1022
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:14,066
AND A CUP OF JOE, BUT NOW WE

1023
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:20,000
TREMBLE BEFORE SATAN'S CUPCAKES.

1024
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,066
SHOW UNCUT AND FLAPJACKS AND

1025
00:28:23,066 --> 00:28:24,200
STACKED.

1026
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,600
WHEN THE MUFFINS RISE, WE MUST

1027
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,233
RISE AGAINST THEM, BECAUSE YOU

1028
00:28:29,233 --> 00:28:32,033
DON'T KNOW THE MUFFIN MAN,

1029
00:28:32,033 --> 00:28:32,967
AMERICO, AND YOU HAD BETTER PRAY

1030
00:28:32,967 --> 00:28:37,033
YOU NEVER DO.

1031
00:28:37,033 --> 00:28:39,233
PANCAKES, THE UNDENIABLE VIEW OF

1032
00:28:39,233 --> 00:28:41,934
LIFE.

1033
00:28:41,934 --> 00:28:43,500
>> John: THAT'S OUR SHOW.

1034
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,734
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

1035
00:28:45,734 --> 00:28:47,000
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

1036
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
GOOD NIGHT!
