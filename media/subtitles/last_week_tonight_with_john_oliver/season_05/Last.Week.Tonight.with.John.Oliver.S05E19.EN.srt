00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,000
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,400
SEASON V
EPISODE 19

3
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,680
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,400
I'm John Oliver.
Than you for joining us.

5
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,840
Another development in the scandal
we've been calling "Stupid Watergate".

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,640
Instead
of inspiring Oscar-winning movies,

7
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,600
it'll be the basis of direct-to-cable
comedies featuring fart jokes

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,120
and Larry the Cable Guy.

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,360
With investigators
seemingly closing in,

10
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,680
the president
was apparently worried.

11
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,920
"The Washington Post" says
things are unraveling behind the scenes

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,520
for President Trump who fears for
his son, Donald Trump Jr.

13
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,200
A source tells the president
does not believe

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,680
his son purposely broke the law,
but is fearful nonetheless,

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,840
that Trump Jr. may have
wandered into legal jeopardy.

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,400
Yeah. That seems
pretty plausible to be honest.

17
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,760
On the long list of "things Don Jr.
is likely to wander into",

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,480
"legal jeopardy"
is right up there

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,760
with "the women's dressing room"
and "a screen door".

20
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,880
Trump was firing back
on Twitter saying:

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
"fake news reporting, a fabrication,
I am concerned about the meeting"

22
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,800
"my wonderful son, Donald,
had in Trump Tower."

23
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,160
"This was a meeting to
get information on an opponent,"

24
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,600
"and it went nowhere,
I did not know about it !"

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,040
There is so much wrong there, from
the fact it undermines the excuse

26
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,000
he supposedly dictated that this
meeting was about Russian adoptions

27
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,720
to claiming he didn't know
about it and if he did,

28
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,040
nothing happened and if it
wasn't, he didn't know about it.

29
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,160
The most galling lie in there

30
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,000
is describing Donald Jr.
as a "wonderful son".

31
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,000
That is flagrantly false.

32
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,800
He is barely even
the most wonderful Donald Trump.

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,240
That is not the only legal case
the president was following closely.

34
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,200
Also the trial of Paul Manafort,
Trump's former campaign manager

35
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,640
and a man who could be convicted
of every single crime on earth

36
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,800
and still not be
as guilty as he looks.

37
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,000
This week,
Manafort was in court,

38
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,520
where he's been charged with
money laundering, tax evasion,

39
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,680
obstruction of justice,
bank fraud.

40
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,680
He's charged with 32 counts or as
they call it "a mobster's dozen"

41
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,520
and it's something that
Trump sees as an outrage.

42
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,760
Trump tweeting: "looking back
on history, who was treated worse:"

43
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,600
"Alphonse Capone, mob boss,
killer and 'public enemy number one"

44
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,480
"or Paul Manafort, political operative
and Reagan/Dole darling,"

45
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,120
"now serving confinement,
although convicted of nothing ?"

46
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,040
What ?

47
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,320
So, broadly, I think
the argument there is:

48
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,480
Paul Manafort is less of a criminal
than America's most famous criminal.

49
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,880
Which is surely the most
daring legal strategy

50
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,520
since Johnnie Cochran's
quickly abandoned:

51
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,240
"Relax, it's not
like he's Hitler !" defense.

52
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:24,240
"If he's not Hitler, you must
acquitler." Brilliantly legal mind !

53
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,320
The prosecution presented evidence
of Manafort's lavish lifestyle,

54
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,520
with tantalizing details,
from a $10 000 karaoke system

55
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,840
to spending $450 000 on
landscaping his Hamptons house,

56
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,680
including both a man-made
waterfall and I quote:

57
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,360
"one red flower bed
in the shape of an 'M.'"

58
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,520
Maybe it wasn't actually
an "M" for "Manafort".

59
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,680
Maybe he was still saving up
for the "Night Shyamalan".

60
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,320
That would be
a bold piece of botany.

61
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,320
Most of the attention focused
on the $1.3 million he supposedly spent

62
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,720
on clothes between
2010 and 2014.

63
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,120
His taste was truly spectacular.

64
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,720
In April 2012, Manafort paid
$18 500 dollars for a python jacket.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,400
A few months earlier,
it was $9 500 on an ostrich vest

66
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,640
to complement the ostrich jacket
he later paid $15 000 for.

67
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,640
$24 000 on an ostrich outfit ?
That is ridiculous !

68
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,640
When you can find
one online for $55 !

69
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,920
If you are thinking at all:

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,240
"hold on, maybe when you see
the jacket, it'll be worth it",

71
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,160
I'll show you,
it fucking isn't.

72
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,880
I never thought I'd say this, but
that looked better on the ostrich.

73
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,440
It's a jacket for people who also have
a subscription to "Reader's Digest".

74
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,680
It's what the Fonz would wear on
the days he didn't feel like fucking.

75
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,000
This thing actually has a hood.
A hood !

76
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,200
For when you want to wear your
$15 000 jacket out in the rain.

77
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,160
Like a fucking idiot.

78
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,120
The judge won't allow pictures of
Manafort's clothes to be shown.

79
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,160
Which is probably good idea,
because if they saw this,

80
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,320
a jacket that screams
"I framed Roger Rabbit",

81
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,160
he wouldn't stand a chance.

82
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,840
Manafort bought many of these items
at a store called "House of Bijan",

83
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,120
which sounds like a place where
you would buy knock-off mustard.

84
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:37,160
C'mon, mom, you bought Bijan again ?
Pay the extra 50 cents ! I hate this !

85
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,680
House of Bijan is
something far worse.

86
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,440
Watch the store's 26-year-old
co-owner, show you another piece.

87
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,360
This beautiful silk blazer in white.
There's only one piece made.

88
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,800
You have all of these buttons
and our silver crest.

89
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,720
Inside in pure silk with
all it's detailing by hand.

90
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,640
For example,
this jacket is $12 000.

91
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,440
Okay, just so I have this straight:
the jacket costs $12 000

92
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,880
because it has buttons
and a silk lining ?

93
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,240
At least the shit Manafort was buying
was made out of murdered snakes.

94
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,640
That jacket is $12 000 worth
of worm vomit,

95
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,160
organized into the shape
of a naval uniform

96
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,760
worn by the lowest-ranking officer
on the S.S. Nouveau Riche.

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,200
This case is more than Manafort's
shitty fashion sense.

98
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,520
Although one thing it isn't about
is the 2016 Trump campaign,

99
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,400
something that Fox News
has been emphasizing.

100
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,240
The charges he's been brought against
have nothing to do with the election.

101
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,600
No talk
though about Russian collusion.

102
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,600
The charges that Manafort is now
facing have nothing to do with Trump.

103
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,480
Nothing to do with the campaign, zero.
Nothing to do with Russia, zero.

104
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,160
Nothing about collusion.

105
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,200
That's true on its surface.
But this case is also not exactly

106
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,240
not about
the 2016 campaign, either.

107
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,760
The president's campaign manager
allegedly received millions of dollars

108
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,720
from thuggish Kremlin puppets
and, despite all the money he saved,

109
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,720
had gone broke supporting his
addiction to bad jackets,

110
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,880
yet for some reason he agreed
to work for Trump for free.

111
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,160
Who knows
why he did that ?

112
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,240
You probably do.
And I probably do.

113
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,400
Anyone briefed on the broad
strokes of this situation,

114
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,360
even in the vaguest possible
terms, probably does.

115
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,280
But no one besides basically
anyone can say for sure.

116
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:47,400
It's basically right. I can
think of only one creature on earth

117
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,920
that that argument might actually
work on and unfortunately,

118
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,240
it's been skinned to make a jacket
for Paul fucking Manafort.

119
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,400
And now, this.

120
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:04,040
Even more of Paul Manafort's jackets
and what they say about their owner.

121
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,000
I briefly dated your nana
after her third divorce.

122
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,680
I'm the best Cher impersonator
in Rapid City, South Dakota.

123
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,680
I missed out on inheriting a candy
factory because I ate weird gum.

124
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,720
I'll be skipping the second day
of this safari to masturbate.

125
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,800
Excuse me, miss, but have you
ever fucked in a Toyota Tundra ?

126
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,440
I was outbid by Bradley Whitford
in "Get Out".

127
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,560
I am three children stacked
on top of each other

128
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,080
and still wouldn't be
caught dead in this.

129
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,680
Maria from "Sound of Music"
made this out of a throw rug

130
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,760
before she killed herself.

131
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,920
I was kicked out of Big Bad
Voodoo Daddy in 1997

132
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,400
for trying to fuck the saxophone.

133
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,160
So, moving on. Our main story
concerns criminal justice.

134
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,840
The process by which
you are arrested, charged,

135
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,280
go before
a jury who render their verdict:

136
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,360
We find the defendant
Robert Brooks... not guilty.

137
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,160
We find Randall Bailey... guilty.

138
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,360
We find the defendant...
not guilty.

139
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,560
Have you reached a verdict ?

140
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,360
Guilty or not guilty ?

141
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,960
That is just charming, although
all these years later,

142
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,960
I still can't believe those penguins
convicted the Central Park Five.

143
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,360
Whenever we talk about
criminal justice reform,

144
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,600
we tend to just talk about policing,
public defenders, judges, and prisons

145
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,760
and skip over a crucial element
there: prosecutors,

146
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,440
the attorneys who work for federal,
state, and local government

147
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,000
and bring cases to trial.

148
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,200
There are 2 500 D.A.'s offices
all around the country

149
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:54,680
and they have influence at every stage
of the criminal justice system.

150
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,920
Prosecutors decide whether
and what you get charged with

151
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,080
and influence what kind
of sentence you could face.

152
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,200
You know deep down
how important they are,

153
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,120
because of a phrase that crops up
in local news crime stories.

154
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,960
It'll be prosecutors who decide
whether charges will be filed.

155
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,840
Prosecutors will decide whether
to file charges.

156
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,120
Prosecutors will decide what happens.

157
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,480
Prosecutors will decide.

158
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,080
Prosecutors will decide.

159
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,760
Exactly, prosecutors will decide.
It's one of those three-word phrases

160
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,360
that you hear so often, you don't even
think about what it means,

161
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,800
like "user agreement update"
or "some restrictions apply"

162
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,760
or "Tyler Perry presents".

163
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,800
I'm just going to assume
that he presents everything.

164
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,200
I think he presents this show.
I wouldn't be surprised about that.

165
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,560
We tend not to think
about that power very much,

166
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,840
except when there is controversy
concerning failure to exercise it,

167
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,080
as has happened in police shootings
of unarmed black men,

168
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,280
or when Manhattan D.A. declined
to prosecute Harvey Weinstein in 2015

169
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,200
citing insufficient evidence,
despite police officials insisting

170
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,760
they had plenty of evidence,
including exhibit A: "his face".

171
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,640
It is worth talking about what
happens when prosecutors

172
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,120
do decide to exercise that power,
because while many try to do

173
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,680
their jobs honorably, that power
can be misused or amplify

174
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,960
the inequities
inherent in the system.

175
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,480
The vast majority of the time,

176
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,480
your fate is not decided
by a judge or a jury of your peers.

177
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,280
95 percent of the cases
prosecutors decide to bring,

178
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,720
end up with the defendant
pleading guilty.

179
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,800
That means no trial,
no "innocent until proven guilty",

180
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,240
just a prosecutor striking a deal
behind closed doors.

181
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,320
Many judges are resigned to that fact,
plea bargains keep the system moving.

182
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:58,480
The system would collapse
if every case that was filed

183
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,600
in the criminal justice system
were to be set for trial.

184
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,800
The system would
entirely collapse.

185
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,640
It's an inadequate system that
only functions if people give up.

186
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,760
It's built on the exact same model
as AT&T's customer-service hotline.

187
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,440
AT&T, new owners of HBO,
longtime owners

188
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,520
of an unforgivably dogshit
customer service hotline.

189
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,040
If you are thinking:

190
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,320
"If somebody pleads guilty,
they must've done it."

191
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,200
That's not the case. In Houston,
testing of samples in drug cases

192
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,640
have exonerated 133 people
since 2014

193
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,280
and those people had pled
guilty in every single case.

194
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,200
The only people who should
be claiming to have used drugs

195
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,800
when they haven't are awkward
teenagers at high school parties.

196
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,080
I'm totally a weeder.
I'm into all the weeds.

197
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,040
I'm stoning right now,
that's how potted I am.

198
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,160
Why do innocent people plead guilty ?
Prosecutors will offer a deal,

199
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,160
while threatening that,
if you go to trial,

200
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,080
they will stack charges against you
and pursue a harsher sentence.

201
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Something commonly
referred to as a "trial penalty".

202
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,600
Listen to Rodney Roberts.
He was accused of a sexual assault

203
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,480
that DNA evidence later
proved he did not commit.

204
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,040
I'll let him
explain why he took a deal.

205
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,960
When I got to the court,
this attorney he came in and told me

206
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,200
that the prosecutor's office
had a plea agreement for me.

207
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,040
I'm like "plea agreement ?
I didn't even do it ! I'm innocent."

208
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,360
He was like: "this is urgent",
it was this pressure.

209
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,440
He was like: "if you don't take this
deal, they only offer you two years,"

210
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,600
"if not, the judge is ready to give you
life sentence if you get found guilty"

211
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,160
"and I think you're gonna get
found guilty."

212
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,960
This is my attorney. The one person
that was there to help me.

213
00:13:53,280 --> 00:14:00,080
To get home to my son, to my family,
and to salvage my life,

214
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,280
the best thing I could do was to plead
guilty and fight it once I got home.

215
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,760
As crazy as it sounds,
it kind of makes sense.

216
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,240
Two years in prison is terrible,
but a life sentence is terrifying.

217
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,320
The only way it make sense
for a defendant to risk that

218
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,120
is if they're a gerbil,
because two years and life

219
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,480
are the same thing
to those little shits.

220
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,080
Let's say you are one of the five
percent who risk going to trial.

221
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,800
Prosecutors still have lots of ways
to try and gain an advantage.

222
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,520
Prosecutors are not allowed

223
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,680
to discriminate by race
during jury selection.

224
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,800
If it's suspected they are,
the Supreme Court has said

225
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,960
that they could be required to provide
explanations for striking jurors.

226
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,120
Sounds like a good rule. But it has
been laughably easy for them

227
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,800
to get around, because judges
will accept just about any reason.

228
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,840
In Texas, a training document
for prosecutors listed examples

229
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,360
of "race neutral reasons"
that judges had accepted,

230
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,120
including:
"having a 1970s hairdo",

231
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,520
"being a girl, who might be attracted
to the defendant or the counsel",

232
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,880
"wearing a Malcolm X hat", "agreeing
with the O.J. Simpson verdict",

233
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,480
"being a male wearing earrings
in both ears"

234
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,480
and for "wearing a 'Bad Boys Club'
jacket, pink hat and snakeskin belt."

235
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,760
Which is insulting, that look does
not make you untrustworthy.

236
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,360
It makes you awesome.
I like the way I look, I guarantee it.

237
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:36,240
The area where prosecutors can exert
the most influence concerns evidence.

238
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,640
They control the case files,

239
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,120
police reports, witness information
and physical evidence.

240
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,040
While they are required to hand
over anything that is exculpatory,

241
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:52,560
in some states, including New York,
they can do that at the last minute.

242
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,880
Something incredible
happens on the day of trial,

243
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,000
a case file that for a year
was this thick,

244
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,680
suddenly now becomes
this thick.

245
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,360
In the cases where we have clients
who are looking at

246
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,040
incredible amounts of jail time,
even life in jail,

247
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,240
this is what we are given
when D.A.s answer ready for trial.

248
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,360
The reality is that in Manhattan
too often it is trial by ambush.

249
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,360
And they have to argue a case without
having read all the important material.

250
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,960
It's a much higher stakes version
of a kid giving a presentation

251
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,640
in English class
without having read the book.

252
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,480
In conclusion,
throughout "Wuthering Heights",

253
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,960
the heights are wuthering,
but by the end,

254
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,960
the heights wuther much more than
they wuthered at the beginning.

255
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,560
Thank you for your time.

256
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,760
A quick but important
message for English teachers:

257
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,960
no one has ever read a single
book you have ever assigned.

258
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,400
It has never happened.
Not once. Ever.

259
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,080
Defense attorneys may not be given
exculpatory evidence at all.

260
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,720
Among exoneration cases,
around a quarter of them

261
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,000
involved prosecutors
concealing exculpatory evidence.

262
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:13,880
Prosecutors get to decide whether
something is relevant to the defense.

263
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,760
Inherently flawed.
You can't count on an adversary

264
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,800
to voluntarily
expose all of their weaknesses.

265
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,760
In Star Wars, the rebels had
to steal the Death Star plans.

266
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,160
The Empire didn't just email
it to them with a subject line:

267
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,080
"Fwd: Gigantic stupid weak spot,
parentheses very dumb, go to town."

268
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,320
When prosecutors withhold evidence,
there's little accountability for them.

269
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,600
Michael Morton... In 1987, he was
convicted of his wife's murder,

270
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:46,280
after the prosecutor withheld crucial
pieces of exculpatory evidence.

271
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,000
That prosecutor, Ken Anderson, was
held to account for that misconduct.

272
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,560
There was a slight discrepancy
between the two men's sentences.

273
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,360
Morton served nearly 25 years
in prison, 8 995 days.

274
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,240
The sentence for the prosecutor:
ten days in jail for contempt of court.

275
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,600
Ten days !
And he served less than half that.

276
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,600
Although before you get too mad,
he did also have to pay a $500 fine.

277
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,080
Which isn't the penalty
you'd expect

278
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,160
for wiping out 25 years
of someone's life.

279
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,200
It's close to what you'd expect for
fucking a cantaloupe at Whole Foods.

280
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,000
Ten days for the public indecency,
$500 for the cantaloupe.

281
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:35,720
To make it even worse,
Anderson is the only prosecutor

282
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,120
to ever serve any time for misconduct
resulting in a wrongful conviction.

283
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,000
Prosecutors rarely face any sort
of consequences for misconduct.

284
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,840
State bars are supposed
to hold them accountable,

285
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,680
but a study of
five states found that, in 660 cases,

286
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:57,120
the number of prosecutors
disciplined in those cases was one.

287
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,360
And that lack of accountability
can fuel a dangerous culture

288
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,000
where wins are already
prioritized to a disturbing degree.

289
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,360
In Colorado,

290
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,320
prosecutors were paid bonuses
for achieving a high conviction rate.

291
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,920
And in Texas, a D.A. rewarded
convictions in misdemeanor cases

292
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
with a prize they called
"The 'Trial Dawg Award".

293
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,400
As the proud owner
of nine trial dogs,

294
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,920
my award goes to this one.

295
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,360
Please, don't die.

296
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,040
I cannot stress enough how important
it is for you to hang in there.

297
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:42,000
There was the notoriously aggressive
office also of New Orleans D.A.,

298
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,400
Harry Connick Sr.,
who is, yes, Harry Connick Jr.'s dad.

299
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,560
Here they are,
on Harry Jr.'s short-lived talk show,

300
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,880
singing a weirdly duet.

301
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,680
I'm just wild about Harry,

302
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,120
Harry's wild about me;

303
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,840
The heavenly blisses of his kisses

304
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,120
Fill them with ecstasy.

305
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,120
If you didn't see any problem, here's
a fun experiment for you at home.

306
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,880
Call your own father,
tell him that

307
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,240
"the heavenly blisses of his
kisses fill you with ecstasy"

308
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,120
and just see how that goes.

309
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,000
My prediction is, your next fishing
trip is going to be extra quiet.

310
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,400
During his time as D.A., people
were wild about Harry Connick Sr.,

311
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,120
because his office was ruthless.

312
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,320
Harry Connick was tough on crime.
He wanted to lock them up all forever.

313
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,960
Connick's lead prosecutor
was Jim Williams.

314
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,040
Jim took great pride in his numerous
death penalty convictions.

315
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,800
He even kept a miniature
electric chair on his desk.

316
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,200
Jim was regarded as one
of the most aggressive prosecutors.

317
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,880
He described sliding up behind
defendants in the courtroom

318
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,840
and buzzing in their ears
to mimic the buzz of electricity.

319
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,840
Holy shit.
That is just not okay.

320
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,960
There is literally no scenario
in which sliding up behind someone

321
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,600
and saying "buzz" in their ear
is acceptable.

322
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,440
Not even if you are Neil Armstrong,
on the moon,

323
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,000
and you need to get
Buzz Aldrin's attention.

324
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,720
Hey, Buzz. Buzz.

325
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,040
We're on the moon, Buzz.
Buzz.

326
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Are you mad I was first ?
Buzz.

327
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:49,000
That office's win-at-all-costs culture
resulted in serious mistakes.

328
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,920
A quarter of the men sentenced
to death during Connick's tenure

329
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,280
had their convictions overturned
because of withheld evidence.

330
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,360
Remember that electric chair one
of the prosecutors had on his desk ?

331
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,720
Here's a fun fact.

332
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,160
In the photo of Jim Williams
with the electric chair,

333
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,400
of the five faces visible, all of them
were released from death row.

334
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,680
The thing he kept as a token
of his success

335
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,440
is now a monument
to poor decision-making.

336
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,200
It is the prosecutorial equivalent
of Cuba Gooding Jr.'s Oscar.

337
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,360
Why did that joke upset you
more than anything else tonight ?

338
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,880
You have got to be consistent !
You've got to be !

339
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,160
You might care about Cuba, you care
about him too much in this context.

340
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,440
If you want to see all the problems
I've described, in action,

341
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,800
look at the case of Glenn Ford,
on death row for thirty years,

342
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,880
after being wrongfully convicted.

343
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,280
The prosecutor, Marty Stroud,
says that he got caught up

344
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,560
in a hard-charging culture,
and admits to, among others,

345
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,920
deliberately excluding African-American
jurors and overlooking evidence

346
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,720
that would have cleared Ford.

347
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,720
What happened
still haunts him.

348
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,360
I ended up, without
anybody else's help,

349
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,720
putting a man on death row
who didn't belong there.

350
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,560
At the end of the day,
whatever you want to call it,

351
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,320
I did something
that was very, very bad.

352
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,440
Yeah, it was. It was very,
very, very bad in fact.

353
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,440
While he is clearly remorseful,
in terms of accountability,

354
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,520
there were no professional
sanctions for his actions.

355
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,520
The acting D.A. after Ford
was released, Dale Cox,

356
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,600
doesn't believe that Stroud
should have apologized.

357
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,280
Did Mr. Ford get justice
in this case ?

358
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,200
I think he has
gotten delayed justice.

359
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,680
- The system did not fail Mr. Ford.
- It did not ?

360
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,360
- It did not. The system...
- How can you say that ?

361
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,880
Because he's not on death row.

362
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,320
Getting out of prison
after 30 years is justice ?

363
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,440
It's better than dying there
and it's better than being executed.

364
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,400
I guess that's true but listen
to how low he's setting the bar:

365
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,400
better than being executed
or dying in prison.

366
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,920
By that measure,
anything succeeds !

367
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,560
Taco Bell: better than being
executed or dying in prison.

368
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,000
Although, when you think
about it... Is it ? Is it definitely ?

369
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,120
Between 2010 and 2014, that man's
office was responsible for sending

370
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,080
more prisoners to death row
than anywhere else.

371
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,640
If you think the Glenn Ford debacle
made him more cautious,

372
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,920
you would be wrong.

373
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:43,000
Society should be employing the
death penalty more rather than less.

374
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:48,800
But there have been ten other
inmates on death row in Louisiana

375
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,400
who have been exonerated.

376
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,000
Clearly,
the system is not flawless.

377
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,760
Are you sure
you've gotten it right all the time ?

378
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,080
I'm reasonably confident
that I've gotten it right.

379
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,400
You're reasonably confident ?
That does not seem like it should be

380
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,800
the standard to send
someone to death row.

381
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,640
I was reasonably confident I could
pull off bangs. I was wrong.

382
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,680
If someone's life depended on it,
I might've given it more thought.

383
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:22,960
You may well be wondering how
can we fix some of what you've seen.

384
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,080
Permanent legislative fixes
are badly needed,

385
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,760
from requiring greater
transparency from prosecutors,

386
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,840
through so-called "open file laws"

387
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,920
to establishing independent
commissions to investigate misconduct.

388
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,040
Depending on where you live,
there may be a more direct way.

389
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,720
D.A.s are usually elected.
Something you might forget,

390
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:49,480
until you see campaign attack ads,
which ends in a bizarre turn of phrase.

391
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,120
This is how many child molesters

392
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,880
the Calcasieu Parish D.A.
has prosecuted as lead counsel.

393
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,120
How many murders ?
How many rapes ? Robberies ?

394
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,640
Meanwhile, our sheriff reports crime
is on the rise in Calcasieu Parish.

395
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,920
Steve Streete for district attorney,
Calcasieu Parish.

396
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,440
He'll try harder
and a lot more often.

397
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,640
He'll try harder
and a lot more often ?

398
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:27,120
A pretty weak promise, Steve.
What was your opponent's slogan ?

399
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,080
Nathan Hamilton:
Justice on Mondays and Wednesdays

400
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,640
unless something comes up or it seems
it's gonna be a whole thing.

401
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,480
That fact prosecutors are elected
means that you can change them.

402
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:43,640
Around 85 percent of prosecutors
run unopposed.

403
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,760
In one county in Washington state,
their prosecutor run for ten terms

404
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,600
without any opposition,
so four years ago, in frustration,

405
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,680
someone ran
their dog against him.

406
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,200
I know what you're thinking:
"Great, another white dog prosecutor".

407
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,560
I'm not saying you're wrong,
but let's go one step at a time.

408
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,720
We need more
reform-minded D.A.s to run,

409
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,920
because thanks to the extreme
breadth of power they have,

410
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,840
that could be a back-door way to effect
change on a whole host of issues,

411
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,960
from bail, to the enforcement
of marijuana laws.

412
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,640
Maybe you're one of the lucky ones,
maybe your local D.A. is great.

413
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,280
Or maybe they're a winobsessed
asshole whose heavenly blisses

414
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,960
of their kisses
fill their adult sons with ecstasy.

415
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,440
Or maybe you live in Washington
and for the past four years

416
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,240
your district attorney
has been this fucking dog

417
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,000
and you didn't even realize it.

418
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,000
Can you honestly say
with 100 percent certainty

419
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,600
that your district attorney
is not a dog ?

420
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,440
You probably can't.
That's kind of the problem here.

421
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,240
Most people know as much
about their local D.A.

422
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,680
as they know about their
local Cheesecake Factory manager.

423
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,960
Chances are
you don't know who they are

424
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,000
and if you do, it's probably because
something terrible has happened.

425
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,520
Like The Cheesecake Factory,

426
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,080
prosecutors have the ability
to ruin lives in a second.

427
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,040
We need to find out
who our D.A.s are

428
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,160
and get a sense of the policies and
priorities that they're carrying out.

429
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,240
If we do not decide what we want the
criminal justice system to look like,

430
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,520
deep down,
you know who will.

431
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,560
Prosecutors will decide.

432
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,600
Exactly. They fucking will.
And now this.

433
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,960
Fox and Friends' Brian Kilmeade
is definitely afraid of sharks.

434
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,200
It's Shark Week and we have
real sharks. Need proof ?

435
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,720
A great white shark could be
coming to your beach.

436
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,600
Where that sharks heading and does
he have your name on his mind ?

437
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,560
Surfers getting eaten by sharks.
Blue whales are attacking kayakers.

438
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,240
Almost got eaten by sharks.

439
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,080
At SeaWorld,
how many sharks do you have ?

440
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,440
Why are you not
intimidated by sharks ?

441
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,200
Why are all the big creatures
so close to shore ?

442
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,000
Don't you feel there's too many
sharks ? Why are the sharks so angry ?

443
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,920
I was in Palm Beach,
I saw them.

444
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,320
I was always told that sharks
don't like the taste of humans.

445
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,480
If you're ever attacked,
punch them in the nose.

446
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,720
We should stay out of the water
until the ocean starts calming down.

447
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:20,200
One word: pool. Go in a pool
and stay away from the beach.

448
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,840
A spinner shark jumped out,
just kind of at me.

449
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,360
There's a such thing
as a spinner shark ?

450
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,040
It jumps out of the water
and kind of does a spin.

451
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,160
It came right at me. That was
the last time I've been in the water.

452
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,840
That's our show, thanks for watching,
see you next week. Goodnight !

453
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,280
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

454
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,360
END OF EPISODE 19,
SEASON V
