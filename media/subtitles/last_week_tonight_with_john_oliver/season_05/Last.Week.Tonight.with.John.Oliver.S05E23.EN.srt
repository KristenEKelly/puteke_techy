00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,080
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,160
SEASON V
EPISODE 23

3
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,680
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,360
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,880
A quick recap. We begin with Trump,
a man whose face will someday be

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,360
on the new Confederate States
of America five-dollar bill.

7
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,920
A chaotic week for the president,
including this ludicrous way to refer

8
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,320
to the damage
from Hurricane Florence.

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,360
This is a tough hurricane.

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,960
One of the wettest we've ever seen
from the standpoint of water.

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,640
I know it's a high bar, but that
statement is one of the dumbest things

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,280
I've ever heard from
the standpoint of words.

13
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,080
Clearly, the biggest news this week

14
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,400
involved Trump's Supreme Court
nominee Brett Kavanaugh,

15
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,080
a man who looks and I can't
put my finger on why,

16
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,960
like he walks around wearing
a mask of his own face.

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,960
I don't know why he's doing that,
I know he definitely is.

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,080
Kavanaugh's confirmation
seemed like a sure thing,

19
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,000
but then Christine Blasey Ford
alleged that,

20
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,480
in high school,
Kavanaugh pinned her down,

21
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,360
groped her, attempted to pull off
her bathing suit and the clothing,

22
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,480
and put his hand over her mouth
when she tried to scream.

23
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,200
I know that that is graphic,

24
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,720
but the details of these terrible
allegations are important.

25
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,960
They cast a chilling light on comments
he made about his time in high school.

26
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,920
What happens at Georgetown Prep
stays at Georgetown Prep.

27
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,320
A good thing
for all of us.

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,200
Now, for the record, the motto
"what happens here stays here"

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,160
makes anything sound awful
and creepy by default.

30
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,920
If you saw that slogan
at your dentist's office,

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,200
there's no way you would
let him give you anesthesia.

32
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,920
Kavanaugh, who has what I can
describe as a "resting lacrosse face",

33
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,600
denies these allegations.

34
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,440
His defenders
pushed back hard,

35
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,600
putting out a letter vouching
for him, signed by 65 women

36
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,480
who knew him
during high school.

37
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,680
Which doesn't really prove anything.

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,840
There's no person on earth who
hasn't not assaulted 65 women.

39
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,880
Even people who have assaulted
65 women

40
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,320
have also not assaulted
at least as many.

41
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,120
Fox News host Jeanine Pirro,
like many others,

42
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,600
questioned the timing
of the accusation,

43
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,960
suggesting it was a political
tactic by Dianne Feinstein.

44
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,920
And Dianne, why would you wait
to even send it to the FBI ?

45
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,200
Is it because nothing in you
and your pack of demon rats,

46
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:07,320
that's what I said, demon rats,
aka "Democrats" bag of tricks,

47
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,360
was working against Kavanaugh ?

48
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,080
Yep, you got her, Jeanine.
You got her.

49
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,920
What does a demon rat's bag
of tricks have to do with this ?

50
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,560
The most Dianne Feinstein could do
with that would be to levitate cheese.

51
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,320
And that's a skill,
but how does it apply here ?

52
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,680
While Pirro said that nonsense phrase
like it was the first time,

53
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,320
she's been trying to make it
a thing for months.

54
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,920
Here she is back in June.

55
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,560
They're not real Democrats,
they're demon rats.

56
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,280
That's what I said,
demon rats.

57
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,120
Jeanine. Stop trying
to make demon rats happen.

58
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,000
The most disturbing argument
in the Kavanaugh commentary

59
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,600
was the suggestion that,
even if he is lying,

60
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,040
this happened too long
ago to be relevant.

61
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,880
Listen this group of Florida women
active in Republican politics.

62
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,480
You can't judge the character of a man
based on what he did at 17.

63
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,120
But in the grand scheme of things,
there was no intercourse,

64
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,960
there was maybe a touch.

65
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,400
36 years later ?
She's still stuck on that ?

66
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,640
We're talking about a 17-year-old
boy with testosterone running high.

67
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,600
What boy hasn't done
this in high school ?

68
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,760
What the fuck
are you talking about ?

69
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,880
That is a terrible thing
for any high school girl to hear

70
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,400
and perhaps an even worse thing
for a high school boy to hear.

71
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,400
She's acting like assault is a natural
consequence of puberty.

72
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,960
Don't worry if your voice cracks,
you grow hair in weird places

73
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,440
and you start sexually
attacking people.

74
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,120
It's all perfectly normal.

75
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,720
Despite Kavanaugh's
protestations of innocence,

76
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,000
neither he, nor Trump,
nor Republicans

77
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,680
have called for FBI
to look into Ford's claims,

78
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,920
something she said
she would welcome.

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,520
Allies of Kavanaugh have been spinning
alternative theories,

80
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,560
none worse than what his friend
Ed Whelan, a conservative lawyer,

81
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,160
posted on Thursday night.

82
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,640
Whelan tweeted: "a horrific incident
similar to the one the accuser alleges"

83
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,040
"may well have occurred,
but if so, she's got the wrong guy."

84
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,440
"Kavanaugh wasn't present, as this
and more will confirm."

85
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,440
That kicked off a 26-tweet thread
in which Whelan suggested

86
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,440
Ford had mistaken Kavanaugh
for a classmate of his,

87
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,920
who he then named, on the basis
of info from Google Maps

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,640
and a floor plan from Zillow.

89
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,080
He baselessly accused a private
citizen of a sex crime.

90
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,920
Which is terrible, and using Zillow
is just a bizarre way to do it.

91
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,280
It would be like sending
a death threat using Etsy.

92
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,080
I don't really know what's
more surprising

93
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,920
that someone wants me to die
or how gorgeous the needlework is.

94
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,200
What a hand !

95
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,080
Trump was uncharacteristically
restrained on Ford's allegations,

96
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,800
although a source close
to him said on Thursday:

97
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,600
"you have no idea how hard it was
to keep Trump from attacking Ford."

98
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,600
I've seen a raccoon gnaw
through a garbage lid,

99
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,520
so I have some idea how hard it is
to prevent an animal

100
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,320
from indulging in its
rankest beastly impulses.

101
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,720
Trump couldn't hold in
for long how he felt.

102
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:18,120
He tweeted: "If the attack on Dr. Ford
was as bad as she says,"

103
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,800
"charges would have been
immediately filed"

104
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,680
"with local Law Enforcement Authorities
by either her or her loving parents."

105
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,400
The president cast doubt on someone
who says she was sexually assaulted,

106
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,400
while also implying
that her parents don't love her.

107
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,400
That's one of the most
shit-headed things I've seen,

108
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,840
from the standpoint
of shit-headedness.

109
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,040
There are many reasons why victims
don't file charges with the police,

110
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,040
including fear, humiliation and
a suspicion that no one will believe.

111
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,040
This is a conversation
we've been having for decades

112
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,640
and some people still seem
to be struggling to understand this.

113
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,480
It's not even like this is
the first time an accuser

114
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,680
has been attacked during
a Supreme Court confirmation.

115
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,600
Hill had her character assassinated
during the Thomas hearings.

116
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,080
We spoke to her on our show
back in July,

117
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,280
and there's part of that interview
we didn't end up airing

118
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,040
that I'll show you now,
it seems relevant.

119
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,680
Do you think the tone of your
hearing would be different today ?

120
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,200
I'm not even sure we would
have the hearing today.

121
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,600
Really ?

122
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,800
I think that a nominee
would not make it.

123
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,640
I think that now we're gonna be
vetting people to see

124
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,280
if some
of these issues are in their past.

125
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,480
I'm not sure we would
even get to a hearing.

126
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,280
At least we've gotten that far.
If there were a hearing,

127
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,560
I think absolutely
the tone would be different.

128
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,240
I really hope
that she is right.

129
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,840
Ford is now set to testify
on Thursday.

130
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,560
From what we've seen so far,

131
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,360
in terms of victim-blaming
and outright character assassination,

132
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,920
it could well be a sad litmus test
for where we are as a society.

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,400
It is not too late right now.
We can still give her claims

134
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,040
the full and serious
attention they deserve.

135
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,280
This is a lifetime appointment,
the stakes could not be higher.

136
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,240
As Brett Kavanaugh
would put it:

137
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,600
what gets on the Supreme Court,
stays on the Supreme Court.

138
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,720
That could be a very bad thing
for all of us. And now this.

139
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,680
A brief message from Zillow.

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,520
Hi, we're Zillow,
the real estate website.

141
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,120
After the news this week,

142
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,440
we just wanted to clear up
what our company is really about.

143
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,400
Zillow is actually not meant
to be used

144
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,600
to publicly accuse random strangers
of sexual assault, it's really not.

145
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,720
No, Zillow is meant to be used
for one thing and one thing only:

146
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,120
looking up your friends' homes
to see how much they spent,

147
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,880
so you can either laugh
at how much they overpaid

148
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,680
or be jealous of their wealth.

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,280
Again, accusing strangers of sexual
assault: not Zillow's thing !

150
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,160
Stalking and judging the financial
status of everyone you know ?

151
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes. That is what we're about.

152
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,200
Also for burglars casing houses
they plan to rob

153
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,040
and for very occasional masturbating.

154
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,520
But that is it.

155
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,320
Zillow ! Yes, it's for judging people
but not like that !

156
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,840
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns Facebook:

157
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,840
the worst place to wish happy birthday
to a friend other than a funeral.

158
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,560
Facebook has been in the news,
over concerns from privacy,

159
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,480
to fake news, to Russian trolls.

160
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,800
We're gonna go in a different direction
and focus on its behavior overseas.

161
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,720
Facebook has been expanding
aggressively abroad,

162
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,800
more than half its revenue
comes from outside the U.S..

163
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,080
80 percent of its users live in foreign
countries, posting things like this.

164
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,680
That's an international version
of the "In My Feelings" challenge,

165
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,080
that took Facebook
and Instagram by storm

166
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,600
after being popularized
by TheShiggyShow.

167
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,000
Learn more about
all of that in my new book:

168
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,000
"I Don't Know What These Words Mean,
My Staff Assures Me It Makes Sense."

169
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,600
Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg,
pushed his utopian idea

170
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,120
that all connections
are good connections,

171
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,240
with ads showing him
bringing the internet to the world

172
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,040
and Facebook employees
saying things like this.

173
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,320
By connecting the world, people
realize that there are other people

174
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,920
who have different lives than them
and then amazing things happen.

175
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,880
You want to do something big

176
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,080
and you have access
to 1,2 billion people.

177
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,320
What can you do is just
limited by your imagination.

178
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,920
Connecting billions
of people sounds great,

179
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,040
but when it comes to the internet:

180
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,120
a certain number of
those people are then going to say:

181
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,280
"JEWS CONTROL SHARKS
WHO DID 9/11",

182
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,720
and you really have to think
that through.

183
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,600
Thinking things through has
never been Facebook's strong point.

184
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,080
Their early motto was:
"move fast and break things",

185
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,600
a sentiment Zuckerberg
explained this way.

186
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,800
We want to build our culture
and our infrastructure

187
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,560
so that we try to move one or two
clicks faster than other companies

188
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,840
and we go too fast
and we mess up stuff

189
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,160
and then we have to fix it
and that's cool.

190
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,240
Is that cool ?
Is that cool, at all Mark ?

191
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,520
That seems like maybe the most
reckless corporate motto

192
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,400
since the Hindenburg company's

193
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,560
"fly fast and smoke cigarettes
in a big bag of hydrogen !"

194
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,000
How did you not foresee the problems
heading your way ?

195
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,320
And make no mistake:
Facebook has broken things overseas.

196
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,360
Over the summer,
there was an earthquake in Indonesia

197
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,000
and while Facebook
connected people there,

198
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,240
it wasn't necessarily
in the way the situation demanded,

199
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
as this news report shows.

200
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,160
Facebook sends the balloon
and the confetti animations

201
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,240
to users wishing each other well.

202
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,680
The Indonesian word for
congratulations "selamat"

203
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,040
can also mean "unhurt"
or to "survive"

204
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,800
so when Facebook users posted
messages saying:

205
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,040
"I hope people will survive", Facebook
gave them celebratory animations.

206
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,840
That's not ideal, is it ?

207
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,280
There is a time and a place
for balloons

208
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,920
and it's very rarely
after the word "survive".

209
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,720
Let me prove that to you.
I have some terrible news.

210
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,600
We may have to eat each other
to survive.

211
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,760
No, not now !
Now's the worst time for that !

212
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,400
If embarrassing mistranslations
were the only problems,

213
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,160
that would be one thing, but
the company made mistakes overseas

214
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,640
and that is what
tonight's story is about.

215
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,400
In Philippines and Cambodia,

216
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,360
it has been accused
of empowering authoritarians.

217
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,280
In Sri Lanka, India and Indonesia,
viral rumors and hateful comments

218
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,720
have been linked
to outbreaks of violence.

219
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,360
For the worst distillation of
what Facebook can do to a country,

220
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,440
look at Myanmar, the country
you think so little about,

221
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,720
you didn't realize
that's not Myanmar,

222
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,040
that's Mikhail Gorbachev's
birthmark.

223
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,280
This is Myanmar.

224
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,560
Myanmar, also known as Burma,
was, for decades,

225
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,560
cut off from the world
under military dictatorships.

226
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,680
As it's transitioned
to a quasi-civilian government,

227
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,280
internet use there, especially
of Facebook, has exploded.

228
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,720
In 2013, just over one percent
of citizens had internet access,

229
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,640
but now 18 million people
are on Facebook,

230
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,920
thanks in part to it coming
pre-installed on mobile phones

231
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,400
and heavy promotion
by service providers,

232
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,520
who didn't charge Facebook usage
against data plans.

233
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,640
We can use Facebook for free.

234
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,640
Except for looking at photos
and watching videos.

235
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,120
We'll use Facebook for free and ask
the things we want to know.

236
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,640
I'll use MPT and post
everything to Facebook, it's free !

237
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,760
Let's use Facebook for free
with MPT.

238
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,280
Just quick question:
is Facebook free ?

239
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,200
That commercial
didn't quite make it clear.

240
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,760
With Facebook so easy to access,
it basically became the internet,

241
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:16,080
people in Myanmar use "internet"
and "Facebook" interchangeably.

242
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,400
Some people there
use Facebook for fun,

243
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,800
that guy you saw
earlier lives in Myanmar,

244
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,880
while other find it to be a waste
of time, like this irritated teacher.

245
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,040
Everybody is busy on their
smart phone, playing games.

246
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,800
I hate.
I don't like this. It's terrible.

247
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:40,520
Looks like Facebook is a toilet.
Toilet.

248
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,720
I get that he's annoyed.

249
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,280
But calling Facebook a toilet
is a little unfair to toilets.

250
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,520
They make shit go away,
whereas Facebook retains shit,

251
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,960
disseminates shit
to your acquaintances

252
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,520
and reminds you of shit
from seven years ago,

253
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,080
while allowing corporations
to put their shit in front of you.

254
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,760
There is a purity, an integrity,
to toilets that Facebook lacks.

255
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,560
Facebook's issues in Myanmar go
beyond distracted teenagers.

256
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,640
If you have glanced at the "Not Trump"
section of the newspaper at all,

257
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,480
you are probably aware that
Myanmar is a majority-Buddhist country

258
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,520
with a long history of religious
and ethnic tensions,

259
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,040
particularly with regard
to the Rohingya,

260
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,160
a mostly-Muslim group
in the western part of Myanmar.

261
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,120
In 2017, the military executed
a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing.

262
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,160
About 725 000 Rohingya,
about three-quarters of the population,

263
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,000
fled to Bangladesh,
to escape government troops.

264
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,760
One estimate puts the death toll
at around 10 000 people.

265
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,200
Facebook didn't cause that.
I feel comfortable saying it:

266
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,240
Mark Zuckerberg, not guilty
of genocide in Myanmar.

267
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,720
As of this taping.

268
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,880
But, and it is a big "but",
by all accounts,

269
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,960
Facebook absolutely did inflame
pre-existing tensions there.

270
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,880
A report on Myanmar prepared
by independent UN investigators,

271
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,600
said: "Facebook was a useful instrument
for those seeking to spread hate."

272
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,520
It is weird to hear something
that started out as frivolous

273
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,000
be described like that.

274
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,960
It's like if five years from now,
UN investigators called bubble tea

275
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,320
"an aggressive threat
to human rights."

276
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,040
I mean, honestly, I never
really liked it, but Jesus Christ !

277
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,400
Hate speech against Muslims,
and especially the Rohingya,

278
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,600
flourished on Facebook, posted
by military leaders and politicians,

279
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,800
as well as prominent Buddhist
monks like Ashin Wirathu.

280
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,680
Do Muslims have a place
here in Burma ?

281
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,800
We can't repeat his response,
it's R-rated.

282
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,880
But essentially he said, Muslims
were defecating on Burma,

283
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,040
threatening its very existence...

284
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,400
You don't like them very much !

285
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,240
I don't accept them.

286
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,520
Why ?

287
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,960
They're deceiving the world, they
want to take over the whole country.

288
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,080
That monk is so hateful, he has been
called the "Burmese bin Laden".

289
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,080
A Buddhist monk is known
as the Burmese bin Laden.

290
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,680
Which is as jarring as if you found out
there's a Care Bear known as

291
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,000
"the one who fucks".

292
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,320
I always thought Wish Bear would be
the one who fucks.

293
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,520
I mean, look at him.
That bear fucks.

294
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,440
Wirathu had hundreds of
thousands of followers on Facebook

295
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,520
and he used his pages
to wreak havoc,

296
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,440
including spreading false accusations
that a Muslim business owner

297
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,960
raped a Buddhist employee,
a post that helped instigate riots

298
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,840
in the city of Mandalay in 2014,

299
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,920
in which two people were killed
and 20 others injured.

300
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,120
Despite repeated warnings
about Wirathu,

301
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,960
Facebook didn't get around to banning
him until earlier this year.

302
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,880
That is one example of the extent

303
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,160
to which Facebook became
an echo chamber of Islamophobia.

304
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,960
One local official told he was
"proud to oversee a Muslimfree village",

305
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,520
even though he admitted he had
never even met a Muslim before,

306
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,680
adding: "I thank Facebook, it is giving
me the true information in Myanmar."

307
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,600
Here is what happened when ABC
talked to people in the streets there.

308
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,520
Most local people here
get their news via Facebook.

309
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Judging by what
people have told us,

310
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,920
they are not getting
the whole picture.

311
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,520
What do you think
about the Rohingya people ?

312
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,320
I think they are terrorists.
They are making problems everywhere.

313
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,360
I could gather information
from Facebook.

314
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,440
What does Facebook
say about them ?

315
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,160
They want to occupy our land
and our people.

316
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,560
That is very dangerous,
no one should be judged

317
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,640
by the worst things people say
about them on Facebook.

318
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,200
If I were judged by that,
you'd think I was a "cuck twit",

319
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,080
"a prime example of why abortion
should be more readily available"

320
00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:00,280
and that "I look like a distressed bird
trying to get your attention."

321
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,040
Is any of that, apart from that
last one, really fair ?

322
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,640
I would say no !
I would argue no !

323
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:14,520
How did so much hate speech and
violent content stay up for so long ?

324
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,400
It's not like Facebook doesn't
have rules, they have a lot of them.

325
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,520
Their own internal materials
get into details like

326
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,560
which sort of anuses photoshopped
onto faces they're willing to allow.

327
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,960
They even cite graphic examples
such as this image

328
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,880
of Trump
with an anus for a mouth.

329
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,880
That is allowed,
because he is a public figure.

330
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,200
Taylor Swift with anuses for eyes ?
Also allowed for the same reason.

331
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,240
This image of Kim Jong Un
with an anus for a mouth is not okay,

332
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,880
because I quote: "it also displays a
sex toy inserted into the anus."

333
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,600
That still leaves grey areas.
What if I display a meatball sub

334
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,080
being inserted
into that same mouthanus ?

335
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,880
Is a meatball sub a sex toy ?

336
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,480
Could you not argue that meatballs
are the anal beads of Italy ?

337
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,560
Olive Garden ? That slogan
is free for you to use !

338
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,360
You can have it, it's yours.

339
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,240
You can absolutely quibble with
where Facebook draws its lines

340
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,000
and the broader discussion of private
companies policing speech

341
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,560
is an important one,
but Facebook does have standards

342
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,880
that are enforced
in a number of ways.

343
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,440
They have artificial intelligence
that detects objectionable content.

344
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,520
They also rely on users,
like you and me,

345
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,840
to flag objectionable content, which is
reviewed by human moderators.

346
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,560
It's something most social media
companies do, a thankless job,

347
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,000
as you see from this session run by
a content moderation company in India.

348
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,800
Here the person is not naked
but you can see the erection,

349
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,000
the penis is visible.

350
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,080
Now this lady.
Now here, it's very much obvious

351
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,640
that intensely she
is focusing on butt part,

352
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,240
the camera is focusing
on butt part.

353
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,080
It will fall under nudity.

354
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,720
It's not proper nudity
but it will fall under nudity.

355
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,560
I'm sorry but
I'm absolutely calling it:

356
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,920
that guy is definitely
focusing on the butt part.

357
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:25,720
As Facebook themselves will tell
you: policing nudity is the easy part.

358
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,720
It's harder is defining and spotting
misinformation and hate speech

359
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,360
and that is what Myanmar
has been drowning in.

360
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,080
Facebook's system failed them
at every stage:

361
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,760
their A.I. didn't work,
Facebook's technology

362
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,640
isn't compatible
with Myanmar's language fonts.

363
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,280
Not great, but fine.

364
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,760
They needed Burmese people
to flag content for them.

365
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,840
To do that, it might've helped if things
like their community standards

366
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,280
and reporting systems
had been in Burmese.

367
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,480
Which they weren't,
until late 2015,

368
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,280
which isn't great, in a country
where almost no one speaks English.

369
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,840
If Facebook's interface here
was in Burmese.

370
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,880
You would have no way of knowing
which button did what.

371
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,160
That's not even
Facebook's interface,

372
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,760
that's a list of dinosaurs, ranked
from most to least fuckable.

373
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,080
Stegosaurus is way too far
down on that list.

374
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,720
Stegosaurus is basically
the Wish Bear of dinosaurs.

375
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,280
Seriously, that bear can get it.

376
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,480
Wait, it gets worse: even content
that did get flagged in Myanmar,

377
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,160
often didn't get taken down.

378
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,560
One reason for that may be that
Facebook had shockingly-few

379
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,840
Burmese-speaking
content reviewers.

380
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,960
How many ? I'll just let
this Reuters reporter tell you.

381
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,360
Back in 2014 they had one person,
they hired a second in early 2015,

382
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,680
they outsourced an operation,
but they had had no Burmese speakers

383
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,080
until 2015 when they hired two.

384
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,080
It's true: first they had one.
Then they doubled it to two.

385
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,880
And, through outsourcing, added
two more. So, four.

386
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,200
I don't know what the right number
of Burmese speakers for Facebook is,

387
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,320
but it probably shouldn't be
possible for the sum total

388
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,720
to be decimated
in a tandem bike accident.

389
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,440
It's not like Facebook can plead
ignorance or surprise.

390
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,760
Civil society groups and individuals
tried to warn them.

391
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,360
As far back as 2013,
they faced trouble in Myanmar.

392
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
Facebook itself now admits
that they moved too slowly,

393
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,720
though Zuckerberg insists
they're now making progress.

394
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,760
They've hired 60 Burmese speakers

395
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,440
and he told Congress
they're looking for more.

396
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,880
We're hiring dozens of more Burmese
language content reviewers.

397
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,160
Hate speech is language specific,
it's hard to do it without people

398
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,960
who speak the local language and
we need to ramp up our effort there.

399
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,000
"Hate speech
is language specific."

400
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,320
It's weird to hear a guy
who's been universally lauded

401
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,200
as a genius and a visionary say
something that's completely obvious,

402
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,080
as if it's a brand
new idea to him.

403
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,160
It's as if Steve Jobs called everyone
for his brand new discovery:

404
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,680
Mrs. Doubtfire was just the dad
in a costume.

405
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,600
Yeah, we know, Steve.
Did you not get that ?

406
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,720
I thought you were smart !
I don't trust my iPhone now.

407
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,040
Many argue that Zuckerberg
still hasn't done nearly enough.

408
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,480
Hate speech is still widespread
on Facebook in Myanmar.

409
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,360
Last month, four months
after Zuckerberg promised to do better,

410
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,760
Reuters found more than a thousand
Burmese-language posts

411
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,560
attacking the Rohingya
that were still on Facebook.

412
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,200
You could say: "Reuters was
actively looking for those."

413
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,720
You know who else could do that ?
Maybe a company worth $500 billion.

414
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,240
Reuters doesn't have $500 billion.

415
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,600
Their journalist doesn't even seem
to have a decent webcam.

416
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,960
Get the man a decent webcam,
Reuters ! His work is important !

417
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,920
Despite its 60 whole
Burmese speakers,

418
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,760
Facebook is still
struggling with the language.

419
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,000
Earlier this year, their community
standards were badly mistranslated.

420
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,680
Instead of "we take our role in keeping
abuse off our service seriously",

421
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,800
they said: "we take our role seriously
by abusing our services."

422
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,520
Small things like that
really matter.

423
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,760
Even punctuation can change
the meaning of a sentence.

424
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,160
Bill Cosby once wrote a book that
I'm guessing was meant to be called

425
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,520
"Come On, People",

426
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,840
but they omitted the comma so it
read "Come On People".

427
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,680
Deep down, perhaps that's when
we should have known.

428
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,920
I am not saying that the challenges
Facebook is facing are not significant,

429
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,760
but for a company that moves
fast and break things,

430
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,720
they have sure moved slowly
in trying to fix them.

431
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,880
Until they do, everyone should be
treating anything on their site

432
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,480
with extreme skepticism and see
Facebook for what it actually is,

433
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,320
a fetid swamp of mistruths and
outright lies,

434
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,600
interspersed with the occasional
reminder of a dead pet.

435
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,960
That's it. That's what it is.

436
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,000
Instead of producing idyllic ads
about "connecting the world",

437
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,160
at the very least,
Facebook should be producing ads

438
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,560
that prepare countries for how
to deal with their product.

439
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,960
I would suggest something like this.

440
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,440
Hi, we're Facebook.
We're connecting the world.

441
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,720
We're coming to your country
whether you like it or not.

442
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,040
There's one thing about Facebook
you should probably know,

443
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:37,680
somewhere between 80 and 100
percent of what's on site is bullshit.

444
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,160
My Facebook page is full of lies
about how happy I am.

445
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,320
My Facebook page say I go to yoga,
I've been like three times.

446
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,480
My Facebook page says
I'm a 19-year-old girl.

447
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,240
All my photos are of me with
a baby, but I don't have a baby.

448
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,680
Fun ! We at Facebook believe
in giving everyone a voice,

449
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,440
without worrying too much about
what that voice then chooses to say.

450
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,720
How bad could it be ?

451
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,240
I don't believe
the Holocaust happened.

452
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,840
Can someone explain why what
Charlie Rose did was so wrong ?

453
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,680
I wouldn't post that, you can !

454
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,920
George Soros invented mosquitos.

455
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,800
Hillary Clinton created AIDS, yeah.
I'm sure about that.

456
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,440
There is only one Olsen twin, moving
back and forth very fast.

457
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,160
It's not our place
to tell you you're wrong.

458
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,120
We're about making connections.

459
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,440
- Can you connect me to my brother ?
- Sure.

460
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,880
- Can you connect me to Coca-Cola ?
- We can absolutely do that.

461
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,040
Someone just told me they want
to murder my family.

462
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,080
I'm not sure what you said
but it sounded great.

463
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,960
Facebook is a platform anyone
can use to do good, or bad.

464
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,120
It's riddled with bullshit.

465
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,160
We're never gonna be able
to control or contain it.

466
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,560
Before you use our site
for the first time,

467
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,880
there's something
you need to remember.

468
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,480
Facebook is full of shit.

469
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,480
Facebook is complete shit.

470
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,280
Facebook is good for nothing.

471
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,560
Facebook is a useless bastard.

472
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,720
Facebook is trash.

473
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,520
Disgusting.

474
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,920
We are tired of Facebook. It's
a waste of our time. It's all shit !

475
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,360
Facebook is a toilet.

476
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,800
Facebook is like a toilet.

477
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,560
Facebook is a toilet, and God willing,
your country will survive it.

478
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,640
Shit, we've really
got to fix that.

479
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,760
Facebook: we're a toilet !

480
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,640
It's a fucking bullshit.

481
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,800
That's our show.
See you next week, goodnight !

482
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,600
John Oliver is a cuck.

483
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,760
I like sending photos to people
of my butt part.

484
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,160
John Oliver is a puppet for Scientolgy.
How can you not see it ?

485
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,240
Fuck Facebook.
It's a fucking toilet.

486
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:13,760
Merde. Bullshit.
Bullshit, flip the switch.

487
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,520
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

488
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,040
END OF EPISODE 23,
SEASON V
