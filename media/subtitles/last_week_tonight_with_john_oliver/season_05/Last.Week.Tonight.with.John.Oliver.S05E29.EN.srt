00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,800
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,480
SEASON V
EPISODE 29

3
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,040
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,920
I am John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A quick recap of the week...
It was a whirlwind.

6
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,640
A mass shooting
and wildfires in California,

7
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,320
Jim Acosta being banned
from the White House,

8
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,640
Trump skipping a commemoration for
WWI soldiers in France, it was raining.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,200
That might actually have been
for the best, if he'd gone,

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,200
someone would have had to tell him
he can't sit on people's gravestones

11
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,720
just 'cause he's tired.

12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,480
There was
the midterms on Tuesday,

13
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,040
in which Democrats
won control of the House.

14
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,160
A bad result for Trump,
although not according to him.

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,080
You're a man who likes to win, but last
night was not an absolute victory.

16
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:21,080
I'll be honest: I thought it was
a very close to complete victory.

17
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,480
Complete victory ?
You lost the House !

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,720
Trump has an incredible
ability to frame defeat as triumph.

19
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,880
You've taken my king, but I have
my horses and this is "horse chess".

20
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,200
My horse king takes your little guy
that looks like a boobie. Horse-mate.

21
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,160
Even weirder was Trump's glee
at the losses of Republicans

22
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,920
who didn't embrace him
during their campaigns,

23
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,160
because, bear in mind:
these losses were bad for him.

24
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,520
You had some that decided to
"let's stay away." They did poorly.

25
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,360
Mike Coffman.
Too bad, Mike.

26
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,600
Mia Love. Mia Love gave me
no love and she lost.

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,640
Too bad.
Sorry about that, Mia.

28
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,880
I don't know what's worse, his petty
delight over the losses of his party,

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,880
or his petty delight
in his own dumb wordplay.

30
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
I bet he was in bed
that night saying:

31
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,680
"Melania, heard that Mia Love joke ?
Where I said, she gave me no love ?"

32
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,600
Melania would reply: "I can't hear you.
We sleep in different bedrooms."

33
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,560
My favorite response to a loss
took place in Nevada,

34
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,080
where Danny Tarkanian
lost his bid for a congressional seat.

35
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,480
His sixth run for office
and his sixth loss

36
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,120
and his wife had some
choice words for voters.

37
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,320
There is no room
for the voters to complain

38
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,280
when you're going to put a liar
into office, it is your fault.

39
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,240
My husband has a bright future,
our family has a bright future.

40
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,680
I don't know
what God has in store for us,

41
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,560
but there is no way that we
went through all of this for nothing.

42
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,440
She is pissed.

43
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,480
If you bring
God's plan into this,

44
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,040
it seem like God
has been up in heaven saying:

45
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,080
"you know
what'd be really funny ?"

46
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,160
"If I make Danny Tarkanian
lose six elections in a row,"

47
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,440
"just to see
if his wife fucking snaps."

48
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,560
There was also some good news
concerning the midterms.

49
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,840
Three states
voted to expand Medicaid.

50
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,680
Florida restored voting rights
to people with felony convictions.

51
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,160
Utah voted to legalize
medical marijuana.

52
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,240
In the not-so-distant future,
there is a chance

53
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,800
that Mitt Romney could be lying
on a bed, stoned out of his mind,

54
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,480
giggling and asking his wife:
"do you think we have too many sons ?"

55
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,840
All of which is good news
but it quickly got swamped

56
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,160
by the latest development in the story
we've been calling Stupid Watergate.

57
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,640
Trump did the thing that
we've all kind of been bracing for.

58
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,240
Jeff Sessions, until last night,

59
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,080
Donald Trump's attorney general
and punch bag.

60
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,480
After months of public abuse,

61
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,120
the president moved from ridiculing
his senior law officer to firing him.

62
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,280
Trump finally fired Jeff Sessions.
Everyone in America waited

63
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,960
for this shoe to drop,
except Jeff Sessions,

64
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,880
who is always waiting any shoe
to drop for fear he will be crushed.

65
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,280
Trump appointed as acting AG
Sessions' former chief of staff

66
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,360
and oldest person in his karate
class, Matt Whitaker.

67
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,680
Everything about that
appointment is weird.

68
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,480
Sessions' natural successor
would be Rod Rosenstein.

69
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,320
Trump is not a fan of him, as he
protected the Mueller investigation.

70
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,280
So instead, Trump shoved
white Shrek here into the job.

71
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,720
That is troubling, he's been a regular
critic of the Mueller investigation,

72
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,200
has a questionable judicial philosophy,
both criticizing Marbury v. Madison,

73
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,120
and suggesting that
the key criterion for judges is:

74
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,080
"do they have a biblical view
of justice ?"

75
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,360
Maybe the most eye-catching thing
in Whitaker's background is this.

76
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,640
The FBI's investigating
a now shutdown Florida company

77
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,800
that Whitaker was an advisor
for beginning in 2014.

78
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,240
World Patent Marketing billed itself
as helping inventors secure patents

79
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,840
but the FTC
won a judgment against the company

80
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,520
for bilking thousands of customers
out of millions of dollars.

81
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,680
World Patent Marketing
was a scam which is terrible,

82
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,200
if you're gonna make money off
of crushing inventors' dreams,

83
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,000
you should do it on television,
where we can all enjoy the car crash.

84
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,840
It is true that the FTC
shut the company down

85
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,480
as part of a settlement that included
a judgment of over $25 million.

86
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,760
World Patent Marketing's clients
had some truly incredible ideas,

87
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,800
like "Supreme Diva Jeans",

88
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,000
padded pants that help
augment your lady bumps.

89
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,000
Before I show you a commercial
for those butt pants,

90
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,080
I should warn you:
this is gonna get pretty technical.

91
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,480
Science tells us
why all men like big butts.

92
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,400
Men aren't aware why
they're attracted to bigger butts,

93
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
but attracted they are.

94
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,640
In the early hunter-gathering
societies,

95
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,560
it gave women an advantage
to forage for food,

96
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,240
while bearing children.

97
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,840
And speaking of babies,

98
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,400
women with big butts
apparently have smarter kids.

99
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,480
Evolution isn't about
survival of the fittest,

100
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,240
it's about survival of the biggest.

101
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,120
Exactly: a bigger butt makes you
better at foraging for food

102
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,360
and makes
your children smarter.

103
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,640
That is science !

104
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,520
They're referencing
studies published in JAMA,

105
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,520
the Journal Of The American
Mix-a-Lot Association.

106
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Their anaconda don't want none
unless it's rigorously peer-reviewed.

107
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,400
WPM let that inventor down,
because according to court documents,

108
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,240
they misfiled her patent, and left
her with nothing but a prototype,

109
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,440
some samples, a press release
and negative $40 000.

110
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,280
Again, a real shame, because
we tracked that inventor down

111
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,920
and I'm here to tell you
these things really work.

112
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,240
You're gonna want
to take a look at this,

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,640
because normally from behind,

114
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,240
I look like if Flat Stanley
had osteoporosis.

115
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,760
Now, I'm rocking genuine cheeks.
I've gone from empty dinner plate

116
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:31,360
to Christmas ham in one easy payment
of $125 plus shipping and handling.

117
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,440
Can you imagine how great I'm gonna
be at foraging for food with this ?

118
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,040
I'm gonna eat so many things
I find on the ground !

119
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,840
And remember...

120
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:49,840
What you've got to remember is
a paid advisor to that patent company

121
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,680
is now our current acting AG.

122
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,280
While he says he was not aware
of any fraudulent activity,

123
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,360
he seemed hands-on,
appearing in videos for them

124
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,760
and saying in a press release that
"as a former US Attorney,"

125
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,200
"I would only align myself with
a first class organization."

126
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,880
When one client threatened
to file a complaint,

127
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,920
Whitaker threatened him:

128
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,120
"I assume you understand there could
be civil and criminal consequences"

129
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,840
and reminding them
he was a former US attorney.

130
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,600
Which is something he does
have to remind people about him a lot,

131
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,760
because he doesn't look like
a US attorney so much as he looks like

132
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,160
a Kenmore refrigerator that
somehow escaped from a Sears.

133
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,840
There is a lot that
is disqualifying about him.

134
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,800
The biggest red flag is that,
as of this taping,

135
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,040
this is still the photo atop
his Twitter page.

136
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,240
I've gotta say, from one lifter
to another, respect.

137
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,280
Look at this absolute
unit turning on the forklift.

138
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,520
Bustin' ass and building mass.

139
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,720
Somebody's gotta pass those
plates to Jesus, am I right ?

140
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,960
Punch your ticket
at the swole-booth,

141
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,240
cause if the bar ain't bendin',
you're just pretendin'.

142
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,360
I will point out that in
other photos of him lifting,

143
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,840
he has a Japanese tattoo
on the inside of his arm,

144
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,160
which, when translated, reads
"fall down 7 times, get up 8."

145
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,360
I hate to criticize a Japanese proverb,
but:

146
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,280
how can you get up 8 times
when you've only fallen down 7 ?

147
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,240
If you fall down 7 times,
you only need to get up 7 times.

148
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,920
If you're falling down 7 times,

149
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,480
you should really invest
in a pair of Supreme Diva Jeans.

150
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,200
Every time you fall,
you bounce right back up.

151
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,880
That's called an evolutionary
advantage right there.

152
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,800
It should be pretty clear
what is actually happening here.

153
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,720
Trump wants a toady who'll restrain
Mueller, Whitaker seems that guy.

154
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,480
White House was amazingly reportedly
surprised by the criticism of Whitaker

155
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,480
and thinks it could "jeopardize
his chances of remaining in the post."

156
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,120
How is Trump going
to distance from Whitaker ?

157
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,280
He made him
acting attorney general.

158
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,240
He met him in the Oval Office
more than a dozen times.

159
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,880
He went on Fox News and said:

160
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,320
"Matt Whitaker's a great guy.
I mean, I know Matt Whitaker."

161
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,600
But by Friday morning,
Trump was already backpedaling.

162
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,680
I don't know Matt Whitaker.
Whitaker worked for Jeff Sessions,

163
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,440
and he was always extremely
highly thought-of and he still is.

164
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,680
But I didn't know Matt Whitaker.

165
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,320
That is just clearly bullshit.
Unless Trump simply forgot the man

166
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,240
who he appointed acting attorney
general is named "Matt Whitaker".

167
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,480
Which might be plausible.
He does look more like his name

168
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,680
would be "Dorg Blunderbuss"
or "Chunk Smushington".

169
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,080
We have known for more than a year
that Trump wanted to replace Sessions

170
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,640
with someone who will restrain Mueller
and this week, he did it.

171
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,800
So the only remaining question
is: how will we respond ?

172
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,040
Will Congress take steps
to keep Mueller safe ? I hope so.

173
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,120
Trump will go as far as we allow
him to go. That is undeniable.

174
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,120
The only thing that might be
more undeniable...

175
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,840
Is the sweetness of this peach.

176
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,480
And now, this.

177
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,880
Steve Bannon's Election Night
Coverage Went Just Great.

178
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,520
And now your host,
Stephen K. Bannon.

179
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,800
Jim Hoft, you on ?
Hey Jim ?

180
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,040
Did he pick up ?
Tell us what's going on there.

181
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,520
Yeah, well, I'll tell you...
All the way down, so we should...

182
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,640
These open border policies
that the Democrats are pushing...

183
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,000
A lot of it, by the way too,
is this Steve.

184
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,280
Something we've never seen before
and I liked Bush.

185
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,960
We beat everyone.
I mean look.

186
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,800
We didn't get, 'scuse me.
We won.

187
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,040
The entire race on the left...

188
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,520
I still don't have Cernovich.
Let's go back to.

189
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,560
- No, I heard him, Mike.
- You heard Cernovich?

190
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,800
Mike ?

191
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,160
Yeah, I hear you, Steve.
I'm right here.

192
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,280
No, you stay. You're
not going anywhere. Right there.

193
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,920
No. I'm producing.

194
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,600
Moving on. So, our main story
tonight concerns Donald Trump.

195
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,600
A man whose presidential library
could exhibit a Razzie award.

196
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:46,960
He won a Razzie for his supporting
role in the film "Ghosts Can't Do It",

197
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,560
as a businessman
negotiating with Bo Derek.

198
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,440
In this room there are knives sharp
enough to cut you to the bone

199
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,200
and hearts cold enough
to eat yours as hors d'oeuvres.

200
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,800
- You're too pretty to be bad.
- You noticed.

201
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,400
That kissy face is the most disgusting
thing that's ever been in a movie

202
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,360
and I'm very much including
"The Human Centipede".

203
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,840
We're not gonna talk about
Trump's movie career.

204
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,080
But the two-year anniversary of
one of his signature campaign promises.

205
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,400
We are going to drain
the swamp in Washington, D.C.

206
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,400
It's time to drain
the swamp of corruption.

207
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,800
Drain the swamp !
Look at that sign.

208
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,840
Drain the swamp. We're gonna
drain the swamp of Washington.

209
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,600
We'll have fun doing it,
we're doing it together.

210
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,120
"We'll have fun doing it,
we're doing it together"

211
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,240
sounds more like a nervous host

212
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,520
rambling through the introduction
of their first orgy.

213
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,040
We're gonna have fun doing it
and we're all doing it together.

214
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,480
Thanks for the hummus spread, Tom.
We said no names, didn't we ?

215
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,160
Domine domine domine, everybody
fuck now. Mind the coffee table.

216
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,560
Limiting power of industry lobbyists
and special interests is a good idea.

217
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,360
While I would love to give him credit,
the odds are,

218
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,960
if your platform is just
screaming random three-word phrases,

219
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,600
one of them is gonna bound
to end up being good.

220
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,480
"Lock her up !" No.
"Build the wall !" No.

221
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,720
"All-dog zoo !" Stop !
That's actually a great idea.

222
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,920
It took a while, but you
finally threw out a good one.

223
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,400
While Trump by no means
came up with that phrase,

224
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,160
it caught on after he won, because
other candidates began using it

225
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,560
and perhaps none more memorably,
or literally, than this guy.

226
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,320
I'm Bob Gray,
an outsider and a businessman.

227
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,360
I'm running to fuel the economy,
choke off wasteful spending

228
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,320
and secure our nation...

229
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,320
But most importantly,
I promise to drain the swamp.

230
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,760
I'm Bob Gray, conservative
Republican and I approve this message.

231
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,160
Right, except you're not really
draining the swamp

232
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,240
so much as you are moving it
a couple of feet off camera.

233
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,720
And "scooch the swamp" doesn't
quite have the same ring to it !

234
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,960
As much as people have taken to
Trump's "drain the swamp" promise,

235
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,320
it won't surprise you to know that
he has not drained the swamp.

236
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,920
His cabinet included
swamp creatures,

237
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,200
from these Goldman Sachs
veterans working on tax policy,

238
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,600
Gary Cohn and certified handful
of man-candy Steve Mnuchin,

239
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,400
to Wilbur Ross, Commerce Secretary,
wealthy corporate raider

240
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,280
and what can happen when Wallace
Shawn is not stored properly.

241
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,480
Trump has a laughable number
of wealthy businessmen

242
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,160
presiding over policies that could
directly benefit themselves

243
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,840
and their former employers.

244
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,960
Despite "drain the swamp" being one
of Trump's greatest hits at rallies,

245
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,840
many of his supporters
do not seem troubled by this.

246
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,400
The swamp is horrible
and Trump is there.

247
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,480
He's there for the small guy,
he's there for people like myself.

248
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,280
His cabinet is
filled with multimillionaires.

249
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,600
I love that.
They're not politicians.

250
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,960
You don't see them as part of the swamp
who have capitalized on the system.

251
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,240
In a capitalist system,
you're allowed to make money.

252
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,760
- Being rich is good.
- So then what is the swamp ?

253
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,920
- The mainstream.
- You almost nailed it.

254
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,120
It's the mainstream, the elites that
look down on a small guy like myself.

255
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,840
If you're mainstream,
you can't be elite.

256
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,120
By definition, elites are a select
group superior to the mainstream.

257
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,240
Digging into this logical fallacy
makes me sound like an elitist asshole,

258
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,440
not like a mainstream asshole.

259
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,200
Do you see what I mean ?

260
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,680
The narrow question of selfenrichment
is part of why the swamp is a problem.

261
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,480
A much bigger issue is the harm
that it can actually do.

262
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,160
That is what our story is about.
Because real damage is being done

263
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,360
to the "small guy"
by this administration's actions.

264
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,320
Take payday lending.
People's lives can be destroyed

265
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,440
by misleadingly-marketed
high-interest loans.

266
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,600
The head of the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, Mick Mulvaney,

267
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,720
works with the payday-loan industry
to block rules reining them in.

268
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,400
Why ? I don't know. What I do
know is that, as a congressman,

269
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,800
he got $60 000 in contributions
from payday-lending interests.

270
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,040
He told a roomful of bankers
this amusing anecdote.

271
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,000
We had a hierarchy
in my office in Congress.

272
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,720
If you're a lobbyist who never gave us
money, I didn't talk to you.

273
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,800
If you're a lobbyist who gave us money,
I might talk to you.

274
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,080
He said he would talk to constituents
whether they gave him money or not.

275
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,800
Molly is admitting that as a lobbyist
money might get you a meeting,

276
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,360
you don't often hear
that from a politician.

277
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,480
Yeah, you don't. It's something
that everyone naturally assumes,

278
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,000
but it is weird to hear it.

279
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,200
Like a Disney World
attendant saying:

280
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,080
"Who wants to have their photo
taken with a 30-year old theater major"

281
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,720
"who couldn't hack it in the industry
and who wears a mouse suit ?"

282
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,760
There's no new information there,
but is still unpleasant to listen to.

283
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,960
Just focusing on the famous
alligators in Trump's swamp

284
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,840
is missing the most important damage
getting done by less-known bureaucrats.

285
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,680
Let's look at two
agencies tonight. First, the EPA.

286
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,360
For a year, it was run by Scott Pruitt,
who became a household name

287
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,520
for spending $40 000
on a soundproof booth in his office,

288
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,160
trying to get the CEO of Chick-fil-A
to give his wife a franchise

289
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,040
and demanding an expensive
24/7 security detail,

290
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,960
then drive around town to see which
Ritz-Carlton had the lotion he liked.

291
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,360
Which is simply insane.

292
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,760
Everyone knows the best lotion
comes from La Quinta Inn.

293
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,160
If you want to masturbate with hotel
lotion, choose La Quinta.

294
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,200
It's like their slogan says:

295
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,040
"La Quinta has the lotion
that will help you jizz."

296
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,440
Once Pruitt left, there were not
as many flashy headlines about the EPA

297
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,080
but that is actually dangerous,
he was not an isolated case.

298
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,440
Half of the political appointees
hired by Trump at the EPA

299
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,200
have strong industry ties.

300
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,520
The guy who replaced Pruitt
is not much of an improvement.

301
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,200
The man tapped
to be Pruitt's replacement ?

302
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,840
Andrew Wheeler, a man who
"Forbes" says earned

303
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,560
more than $700 000 in recent years
as, wait for it, a coal lobbyist.

304
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,400
CNN, you really don't need to ask
the American people to "wait for it".

305
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,320
Surprise is just one more emotion
that Trump has destroyed,

306
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,560
along with joy, wonder
and the ability to see someone

307
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,400
wearing a red hat from behind
without mentally saying "goddamnit".

308
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:49,440
Wheeler pushed hard to roll back
environmental regulations.

309
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,720
Here he is, as a lobbyist, meeting
with Rick Perry, doing exactly that.

310
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,360
A year later, he is running the EPA

311
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,400
and dismantling the regulations
he lobbied against.

312
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,480
It's like handing your city's waste
management over to a seagull.

313
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:11,640
We just throw our trash everywhere
and leave it strewn around ?

314
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,480
We should have more french fries
in our garbage ?

315
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,360
How the fuck
are you in charge ?

316
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:23,680
Wheeler is a good example of how,
once Trump's swamp starts seeping in,

317
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,680
it can filter all the way down
an organization.

318
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:32,640
Look at the Department of the Interior.
We've lavished quite a bit of attention

319
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,760
on Trump's appointee to head them,
Ryan Zinke, which is understandable.

320
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,000
He rode a horse to work
on his first day,

321
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,880
he swung Karen Pence around
like a bag of potatoes

322
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,520
and despite he is not a geologist,
he has a weird habit of doing this.

323
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,720
That's the question to ask
and I'm a geologist.

324
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,400
I'm a geologist.

325
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,200
He's not a geologist.
At all !

326
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,880
Bragging about being
a geologist is a very weird boast.

327
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,280
It's just behind walking around saying:
"I own crackers."

328
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,040
"Saltines, Cheez-Its... you name it,
I own it."

329
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,120
"Not oyster crackers of course.
Who am I, Bill Gates ?"

330
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,480
Zinke has also taken 66 personal days
in his first year-and-a-half on the job

331
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,840
and has been the subject
of 15 investigations.

332
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,000
He may actually be gone any day.
Even if that happens,

333
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,400
serious problems will remain,
the swamp runs deep.

334
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,720
Interior is a massive department and
there is real power at every level.

335
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,360
Look at this organizational chart.

336
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,120
Below Zinke and the deputy secretary

337
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,760
and the assistant secretary
for Land and Minerals Management,

338
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,280
you will find the Bureau of Safety And
Environmental Enforcement or "BSEE"

339
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,280
which is in charge
of safety on offshore oil-rigs.

340
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,360
Wouldn't regulatory oversight

341
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,720
of any resource development
on the outer continental shelf

342
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,440
fall under the jurisdiction of
the Minerals Management Service ?

343
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,560
Wouldn't that be
where the responsibility lies, John ?

344
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,560
To which I say:
"Congratulations on being a sex god."

345
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,400
You're right. The Minerals Management
Service used to be in charge of safety,

346
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,240
until 2010, when there was
that catastrophe at Deepwater Horizon.

347
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,120
This is the video
BP did not want the world to see.

348
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,600
A toxic blend
of oil and gas,

349
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,240
spewing from its broken well
at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico.

350
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,120
Deepwater Horizon pumped 130 million
gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico,

351
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,600
about 12 times the size
of the Exxon Valdez spill,

352
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,920
costing the region billions and hurting
the fishing and tourism industries.

353
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,880
You know it was a disaster because
Mark Wahlberg made a movie about it.

354
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,760
He usually chooses to star in films
about the most appalling things,

355
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,960
like tragic shipwrecks,
acts of terrorism

356
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,560
and Mel Gibson's seamless
reintegration into Hollywood.

357
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,360
Years after Deepwater Horizon,

358
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,200
the region was still
feeling the effects.

359
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,080
When little boats fish
in this area right here,

360
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,240
half of what
they catch is deformed.

361
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,080
Really, half ?
And what kind of deformities ?

362
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,800
They've got tumors on their head,
little bumps off the side.

363
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,320
It's all in the gills.

364
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,680
- You see the oil in there ?
- That's oil in its gills ?

365
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,880
If you take this shell off, you can
pull the oil out, and you can smell it.

366
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,160
That's horrible. Not only
did that spill devastate an economy,

367
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,560
it managed to make shrimp
even more disgusting.

368
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,080
I hate shrimp. They are slimy
armored alien bugs

369
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,920
for whom proper preparation
involves pulling out their shit-vein.

370
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,320
There is not enough cocktail sauce
to erase the memory of a shit-vein.

371
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,960
Somehow, that oil spill made them
even grosser.

372
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,520
Before Deepwater Horizon, the Minerals
Management Service was in charge

373
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,200
of safety on oil rigs and collecting
revenues from oil companies,

374
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,240
a bad idea, it was
an obvious conflict of interest.

375
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,360
After Deepwater,
they created BSEE,

376
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,200
an agency whose only job is to keep
people and the environment safe.

377
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,320
That is their sole responsibility.

378
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,840
Promotion of drilling in the gulf ?
That is someone else's job.

379
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,680
BSEE's is safety.
That is why its last two heads

380
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,400
were a former Coast Guard officer
specializing in marine safety

381
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,040
and a former Coast Guard officer
specializing in marine safety.

382
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,120
Trump has taken a different path,
appointing Scott Angelle,

383
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,400
former lieutenant governor of Louisiana
and a guy who is pro-drilling.

384
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,080
Just days after the Deepwater
well was capped,

385
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,240
Angelle was at a rally organized by
the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association,

386
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,160
where he called for an immediate
resumption of deep-sea drilling.

387
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,120
Enough is enough
and it's time to quit punishing

388
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,520
innocent American workers to achieve
some unrealistic political agenda.

389
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,640
While we too support the use of
renewable and alternative energy,

390
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,280
let's keep the conversation real,
America is not yet ready to get

391
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,200
its fuel from the birds and the bees
and the flowers and the trees.

392
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,200
Hold on ! America is not yet
ready to get fuel from trees ?

393
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,280
You mean... wood ?
Scientists have understood

394
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,360
how wood works for years
now, maybe even decades.

395
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:26,080
Angelle joined Sunoco Logistics
Partners, an oil pipeline company,

396
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:31,160
earning nearly a million dollars and
now, he's regulating the oil industry.

397
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,840
If there is any doubt about
his priorities, which there is not,

398
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,880
wait until you see something
we found on YouTube.

399
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,880
Last year, Angelle gave a presentation
at an oil industry conference,

400
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,600
where he was flanked by two men,
one in a hard hat,

401
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,440
both of whom were eating
during his speech.

402
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,120
That is not the important part.
The incredible moment

403
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,280
is when he makes it clear
how accessible he,

404
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,600
the man in charge
of enforcing safety,

405
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,280
is willing to be to industry leaders.

406
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,800
My cell number is, for anybody
that wants to give me a call to talk,

407
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,440
my cell number
is 571-585-3730.

408
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,880
I'd rather you call me, everything
you text to me is a public record.

409
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,520
This is a business opportunity for you
to engage with me

410
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,040
on what you believe
we ought to be about.

411
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,200
Holy shit. He just gave out
his work cellphone number

412
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,080
and encouraged oil bosses to call him
as a business opportunity.

413
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,360
That is outrageous because he's doing
that to avoid the public record.

414
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,080
No one should ever call
rather than text.

415
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,600
I don't care what the scenario is,
if you prefer calling to texting,

416
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,560
you're a fucking psychopath and
you should be put in prison forever.

417
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,880
You text whatever the situation.

418
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,920
That is his real number,
we know because we called it.

419
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,120
He gives it out publicly
to executives all the time.

420
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,800
At another industry conference,
he announced it from a stage.

421
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,360
Who knows what the executives tell him.
It's not part of the public record.

422
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,440
By coincidence, he's urged
the White House to loosen

423
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,320
safety requirements implemented
in the wake of Deepwater Horizon,

424
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,400
which they are now planning to do
and which is estimated

425
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,440
could save oil companies nearly
a billion dollars over the next decade,

426
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,560
which is the most shocking ten-digit
number I've heard

427
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,160
since 571-585-3730.

428
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:39,040
So it seems pretty clear that
Trump has in no way drained the swamp.

429
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,680
What he has done is drained
the phrase of its original meaning.

430
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,520
He was pretty transparent
about how little he meant it.

431
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,240
This is him
one month after his election,

432
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,040
essentially telling everyone
that the phrase was meaningless.

433
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,360
Funny how that term caught on,
isn't it ? I hated it.

434
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,360
Somebody said: "drain the swamp."
I said: "That's so hokey. Terrible."

435
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,040
I said: "Alright, I'll try it."
A month ago I said: "Drain the swamp."

436
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,800
The place went crazy.
I said: "What's this ?"

437
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,560
Then I started saying it
like I meant it, right ?

438
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:21,000
I started loving it.
And the place loved it.

439
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,520
It's "drain the swamp".
It's true.

440
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,880
It isn't. Trump never
meant drain the swamp.

441
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,400
You can tell that
by what has happened since.

442
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,800
He promised to clean up D.C.
and instead,

443
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,360
the guy in charge of the CFPB
is holding hands with loan sharks,

444
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,440
the EPA might as well be run
by a sentient piece of coal

445
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,280
and his head of oil rig safety wants
the industry to blow up his digits

446
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,320
like an under-regulated oil well.

447
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,480
It seems like if there is anyone
who is still hoping

448
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,640
that Trump might drain the swamp,

449
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,160
you can now officially
kissy-face that idea goodbye.

450
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,280
And now this.

451
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,880
Monday Night Football's Graphics
Are Officially Out Of Hand.

452
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,160
Andy Dalton, the Red Rifle's throwing
51 touchdown passes to A.J. Green.

453
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,720
Through the first five weeks,
teams have wrung up high scores.

454
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,680
It's like it's a game of Skee-Ball.

455
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,760
Steve Smith who's come back
from an achilles at age 37.

456
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,760
Joe Flacco's fifth season in the NFL,
he caught fire in the post season.

457
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,160
Jet airliners leave New York,
and their first round picks...

458
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,600
Giants singing the blues when it comes
to their ground game.

459
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,800
Gore started this season
15th all time in rushing yards.

460
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,640
This is just the 11th game
without Favre or Aaron Rodgers.

461
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,120
With his third season of
Marty Mornhinweg as coordinator,

462
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,400
38 scrimmage yards
and six touchdowns.

463
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,320
28 plays against the bills.

464
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,440
A lot of Raiders
walking the plank.

465
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,520
11 career games against Tampa Bay,
he's been a one man wrecking crew.

466
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,800
Moving on. Finally tonight,
let's talk about social media,

467
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,480
the thing Dave Matthews used ten
years ago to tweet things like:

468
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,120
"Dead frog in a fountain",

469
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,240
"Cunnilingus is my favorite.
And walks in the autumn"

470
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,000
"Do spiders fart",
"Swallowed by YOUR farts"

471
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,840
and of course,
"Shart Party."

472
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,760
A tweet that, for some reason,
only has 48 retweets.

473
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,040
It should be the most
retweeted post in history.

474
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,800
Stop watching this show
and go retweet it immediately.

475
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,880
"Shart Party" is a message the world
needs to hear. Hashtag #DMB,

476
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,640
hashtag #Shart Party, hashtag
#Crash Into Me With Spider Farts.

477
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,960
A decade on, the internet
has changed.

478
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,480
Celebrities and a new breed
of so-called "influencers"

479
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,920
are using social media far less
casually and for a big profit.

480
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:59,440
Megastars like Selena Gomez can make
an estimated $550 000 per post.

481
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,360
40 percent of people say
they've purchased an item

482
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,160
after seeing an influencer
use it on social media,

483
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,080
contributing to a billion-dollar
market this year.

484
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,160
When someone like Selena Gomez uses
something on Instagram,

485
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,040
it is hard to resist buying it.

486
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,200
When I saw this picture of her,
I bought those yoga pants

487
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,360
and I'm very happy with my purchase.

488
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,360
I wear them over
my Supreme Diva Jeans

489
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,120
and my apple now looks so juicy,
even I want to take a bite.

490
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,440
But the concern is...

491
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,040
What if she made me
buy something stupid ?

492
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,880
As long as people are clear they are
shilling for a product, that's fine.

493
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,680
Companies pull off large-scale
marketing stunts

494
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,160
without making it clear
what is happening.

495
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,000
It's an expertly executed ad campaign.
50 of the hottest fashion bloggers,

496
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,600
all in the same paisley dress,
all over Instagram.

497
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,000
Paid as much as $4 000 each to post
these pics on the same day.

498
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:04,840
They had us all post at the same time,
between like 12:00 pm and 3:00 pm

499
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,360
and then post it tagging
"Lord & Taylor".

500
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,840
The campaign, a huge success.

501
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,280
"Lord & Taylor" selling out
of the dress almost immediately.

502
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,320
The photobomb reaching more than
11 million Instagram users in two days.

503
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,320
That's not what a photobomb is.

504
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,760
A photobomb would be if,
in someone's engagement photo,

505
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,280
the dress inserted itself,
uninvited, into the background.

506
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,800
That is not allowed.
If you're being paid,

507
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,080
you're supposed to tag your
post with a clear disclosure,

508
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,000
like #ad,
or #sponsored.

509
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,920
Lord & Taylor got in trouble
with the FTC which said

510
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,840
the company "deceived consumers"
with that stunt.

511
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,480
Though they are
by no means the only offender.

512
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,000
One study about
the biggest accounts found

513
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,480
that over 90 percent of sponsored posts
were not properly labeled or disclosed.

514
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,160
The Kardashians have been
criticized for this.

515
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,120
Last year, the FTC sent
a letter to Popeyes Chicken,

516
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,560
after Kourtney Kardashian posted
this image of her and Khloe

517
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,480
eating Popeyes on a private jet,

518
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,360
captioning it with: Popeyes on the PJ.
Hashtag #cheatday.

519
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,520
You know you are rich
if the common acronym "PJ"

520
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,760
no longer means "pajamas",
it means "private jet".

521
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,120
"I need to work from home today,
FYI",

522
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,200
you know, for yacht inspection.

523
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:25,640
Look in the yard, it's a UFO !
An "unbelievably fancy ostrich".

524
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,960
The most shameless social-media
marketer is DJ Khaled.

525
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,200
Truth in Advertising cataloged
more than 200 instances

526
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:37,360
in which he promoted alcoholic
drinks to his millions of followers,

527
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,960
without disclosing
a connection to the companies.

528
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,400
And some of those videos
were remarkable.

529
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,920
It's time to celebrate.
Grits. Cinnamon Toast Crunch

530
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,760
with the Belaire Gold Key.

531
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:56,320
A little berries
and some Ciroc Red Berry.

532
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,960
And then go back and
add a little more berries

533
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,960
and a little more champagne.

534
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,200
Grits, two kinds of alcohol
and Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

535
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,520
It sounds like the clues for
the $100 000 Pyramid category:

536
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,160
Things That Will Be Pumped Out Of
Kid Rock's Stomach When He Dies.

537
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,080
Is this the most
important thing in the world ? No.

538
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,320
But it is probably safest to assume
that until this is properly regulated,

539
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,800
anyone you see promoting a product
is probably being paid for it.

540
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:30,040
That may well affect how much you
then trust that person going forward.

541
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,160
I have never accepted compensation
for anything on this show.

542
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,160
But, having seen how
much money is involved here,

543
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,760
we've been doing something
all year long that, surprisingly,

544
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,880
no one has noticed,
and frankly, it is now payoff time.

545
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,520
I've been quietly engaging
in advertising so undisclosed,

546
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,000
even the advertiser
doesn't know about it.

547
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,640
I'm talking about
the Church of Scientology.

548
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,840
Without their knowledge or permission,
I plugged them,

549
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:00,480
influencer-style, since February,
sometimes it's been subtle.

550
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,880
We snuck a Scientology symbol into this
logo of a federal agency we invented.

551
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,960
In May, I was packing the show up, one
of the items was the book "Dianetics".

552
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,240
We put L. Ron Hubbard's name
onscreen for no good reason.

553
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,960
For half the year,
the Scientology Celebrity Centre

554
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,760
has been
one of the buildings in our backdrop.

555
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,480
Dragonstone, one of
the castles from Game of Thrones,

556
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,720
is back there too,

557
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,560
but that's been there
since the start of the show.

558
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,960
Which has contained more
torture and cruelty ? Hard to say !

559
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,880
There is stuff
that I expected someone to notice.

560
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,480
I've mentioned prominent scientologists
and then vigorously defended them.

561
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,720
I don't blame him for anything.
He's got a good head on his shoulders.

562
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,360
You stay clear, Tommy.
Stay clear, my boy.

563
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,200
If somebody approaches you,
don't tell them you're being paid.

564
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,320
Which are word-for-word the vows
in a traditional Scientology wedding.

565
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,960
They're beautiful vows
and you should go.

566
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,600
That is the reaction
that you'd expect to hear

567
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,560
if the WWE championship
was won by Beck.

568
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,280
Which is plausible,

569
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,560
the guy's a Scientologist
and they give you superpowers.

570
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,280
It's not just a religion,
it's a set of principles

571
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,560
to help you understand and improve
your life and maybe fly.

572
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,640
Just look into it. That's all
I am compelling you sincerely.

573
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,120
That was a bit weird, right ?
Did you not think that was weird ?

574
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,960
You might be thinking:
"Well, come on, John."

575
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,920
"That wasn't obvious enough.
To be obvious,"

576
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,840
"you'd have to stand next to a volcano
like on the cover of "Dianetics"

577
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,400
"and mention Lord Xenu."

578
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,680
May I remind you, back on
our second show,

579
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,560
how our Italian election
piece ended ?

580
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,560
That's our show,
Xenu next week, goodnight !

581
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,560
"Xenu next week ?" We thought
the game would be up then !

582
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,000
We thought we'd gone too hard,
too early.

583
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:02,280
We've been doing this shit all year.
It is time to collect.

584
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,040
So to the head of Scientology,
David Miscavige,

585
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,480
first, love to Shelly.

586
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,520
Second: you owe me.
I've looked into this,

587
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:14,920
Rock "The Dwayne" Johnson makes
around $650 000 for a sponsored post.

588
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,360
I am worth one Rock post at least.
So I will take $650 000 now.

589
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,880
I know you have the money.
John Travolta gave you a lot of his.

590
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,600
If you, Scientology, are gonna
tell me, "that's ridiculous."

591
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,080
"Can't pretend you conferred
some unprovable benefit on us,"

592
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,920
"then shake us down
for money,"

593
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
"because of your tenuous proximity
to show business",

594
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,000
let me just say you're being
a real SP about this shit

595
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,840
and the price just went up
to $700 000.

596
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,000
That is our show.
Thank you so much for watching !

597
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,880
Xenu next week !
Good night !

598
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,880
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

599
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,240
END OF EPISODE 29,
SEASON V
