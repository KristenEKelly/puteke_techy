LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,560
SEASON V
EPISODE 12

3
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,200
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,240
Thank you so much for joining us.

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,520
Let's dive straight in with the fact
that yesterday saw a royal wedding.

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,440
As you knew, if you were anywhere
within earshot of CBS's Gayle King.

7
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,960
Hello, I'm Gayle King
of CBS This Morning.

8
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,920
I have one big goose bump.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,160
I'm gonna change hats every hour.

10
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,840
We saw James Blunt go in.
He does that song, "You're beautiful".

11
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,440
That's all I'm gonna sing.

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,080
I feel like crying. My gosh !

13
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,120
This is very good
and very moist.

14
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,280
"You're beautiful." Do you know that ?
I won't sing, I won't sing anymore.

15
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,800
I love that song.

16
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,040
Pippa got a lot of attention.
Everyone was raving about her bottom.

17
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,680
I thought is that a big bottom ?
I don't think so.

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,840
She got attention for her bottom
that people thought was perfection.

19
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,360
I've seen big bottoms,
I didn't think that was one, but ok.

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,120
You know what that's fair Gayle.

21
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,760
We British people are not
exactly known for our taste in butts.

22
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,200
The actual Sir Mix-A-Lot
was a sixteenth-century nobleman,

23
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,200
so inbred
that when a girl walked in

24
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,600
with an itty-bitty waist
and a round thing in his face,

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,000
he just sneezed out of his elbow
and died.

26
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,680
A little bit of history.

27
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,720
Perhaps the most notable part of the
service was Bishop Michael Curry,

28
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,160
who delivered
an impassioned ode to love,

29
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,960
which led to some pretty
awkward reaction shots.

30
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,920
There were some old slaves
in America's antebellum south

31
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,600
who explained
the dynamic power of love,

32
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,240
and why it has the power to transfo...
they explained it this way,

33
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,600
they sang a spiritual even
in the midst of their captivity.

34
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,800
They said if you cannot preach like
Peter and you cannot pray like Paul,

35
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,520
you just tell the love of Jesus,
how he died to save us all,

36
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,680
that's the balm in Gilead.

37
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,120
This way of love
it is the way of life.

38
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,280
They got it.
He died to save us all.

39
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,560
That is the wrong room there, buddy.

40
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,880
Believe me, those are some
of the most repressed people on earth.

41
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,600
Talking to the queen about love
is like talking to her

42
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,760
about the transformative power of the
Taco Bell 5 $ Chalupa Cravings box.

43
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,120
"Don't tell me about this,
I'm not interested,"

44
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,680
"it sounds disgusting, and if I ever
experienced it I'd break out in hives."

45
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,480
"Good day to you, sir.
I said good day to you now."

46
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,160
So let's move on to North Korea.
A country led by a man

47
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,240
who is both a brutal dictator
and also the only person

48
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,880
who's ever been excited to get
a picture taken with Mike Pompeo.

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,120
The proposed summit between
Donald Trump and Kim Jong-Un

50
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,320
is scheduled on June 12th,
but this week, it hit a major snag.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,080
North Korea says

52
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,480
it may call off Kim Jong Un's meeting
with President Trump

53
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,120
over U.S. demands to denuclearize
the Korean peninsula.

54
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,520
The summit is in jeopardy,
for a number of reasons

55
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,920
From the fact that both sides

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,160
apparently have different definitions
of what "denuclearization" means,

57
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,400
to North Korea's objections
to the U.S. and Sout Korea

58
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,200
holding a joint training exercise
called "Max Thunder."

59
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,480
Which sounds way too much like
a porn name for a military exercise.

60
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,840
It's as if the Bin Laden raid
has been called

61
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,560
OPERATION DICK THICKHOG:
BIN LADEN GOES DOWN

62
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,880
Negotiating with North Korea is
the tightest of tight ropes to walk.

63
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,600
And instead of a professional walker,
Trump has brought in a big ol' walrus.

64
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,840
Specifically this big ol' walrus,
John Bolton,

65
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,280
the brand new
National Security Adviser,

66
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,880
who's been appearing on TV
making a pretty alarming statement.

67
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,600
Is it a requirement that Kim Jong Un
agree to give away those weapons

68
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,240
before you give
any kind of concession ?

69
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,840
That's right. I think we're looking
at the Libya model of 2003/2004.

70
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,960
Yes, the Libya model.

71
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,560
That may not sound like much to you,
but Bolton bringing up Libya

72
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,280
is literally the worst thing
he could have said in this situation.

73
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,680
It's like if your wife says,
"do these jeans make me look fat,"

74
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,240
and you say,
"I'm fucking the babysitter."

75
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,160
Anything would be better
than that !

76
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,040
The Libya model involved
a deal the U.S and others struck

77
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,320
to get Libya to give up
their nuclear weapons program.

78
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,400
But for dictators like Kim Jong Un,

79
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,200
that example is somewhat tainted
for reasons so obvious,

80
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,240
even the human throw-pillows
on "Fox and Friends" could understand.

81
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,200
Maybe John Bolton
shouldn't have mentioned Libya

82
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,080
because a lot of people think,
"How did that end ?"

83
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,720
"Gaddafi was dragged
through the streets..."

84
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,000
- It's the one thing you remember.
- Yeah, exactly.

85
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,880
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Except
they're also missing out a key detail,

86
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,360
as before Gaddafi was dragged
through the streets and killed,

87
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,240
his enemies
"sodomized him with a bayonet."

88
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,760
And that is the worst way to die,
right after being in a port-a-potty

89
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,440
when Beyoncé walks in on you
and you're not wearing pants,

90
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,480
and you're so embarrassed
that you slam the door on her

91
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,880
and the force of the slam
knocks the port-a-potty over a cliff,

92
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,560
and as you fall down you
hear Beyoncé yelling,

93
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,640
"you'll never do anything
as funny as carpool karaoke"

94
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,880
and as you land upside down,
it hits you

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,520
that the only one who can save you
from drowning in your own feces

96
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,720
is Dustin Hoffman

97
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,360
and the last words you hear are,
"remember me, motherfucker ?"

98
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,200
I assume that that fear is universal.
Anyway, it's not important.

99
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,120
It's not just Kim Jong Un who is touchy
about what happened in Libya.

100
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,520
Gaddafi's death is a common obsession
among autocrats.

101
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,520
Even Putin apparently
thinks about it a lot.

102
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,520
Putin watches that tape
over and over and over again.

103
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,400
It's all he can talk
about for quite some time.

104
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,680
Vladimir Putin was determined
Gaddafi's fate would not be his own.

105
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,840
I am not actually surprised by that.

106
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,160
If you told me that there is a video
that Putin watches over and over again,

107
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,200
I would guess
it's of someone being murdered.

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,600
That's his "Big Lebowski."

109
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,560
He just throws it on in the background
whenever he's folding laundry.

110
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,480
In fact, for a sense of just
how badly Bolton screwed up here,

111
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,920
Trump actually walked
his comments back.

112
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,080
Yes, Donald Trump, a man who would
double down on a fucking typo,

113
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,040
went on TV and said this.

114
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,080
The Libyan model
isn't a model that we have at all

115
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,320
when we're thinking
of North Korea.

116
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,480
That is the President
of the United States

117
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,240
directly contradicting
one of his top advisers

118
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,360
a man who was standing
in the room the whole time.

119
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,840
And look, John Bolton:
How can I put this to you,

120
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,560
what you did in terms
that you might understand ?

121
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,960
Your decision
to say "the Libya model"

122
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,240
may have put your time
in the White House

123
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,800
on the path of The Scaramucci Model,
a model which means

124
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,440
you shoot your mouth off,
get fired quickly,

125
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,760
and end up posing for photos
in front of a frozen yogurt shop

126
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,000
with which you share
a dumb nickname.

127
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,440
And in terms
of sheer pain and humiliation,

128
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,280
that exit truly is the equivalent
of a bayonet up the ass.

129
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,160
And now this !

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,720
And now: local news gets a little
too British for the Royal Wedding.

131
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,400
If you enjoy phony British accents,
this is the week !

132
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,440
Tell us the details
and do it in a British accent.

133
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,320
Hello gov'na.

134
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,280
Cheerio, everyone !
Cheerio this morning.

135
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,600
Cheerio !
I made it to merry old England.

136
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,240
The Royal Wedding.

137
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,680
Hello !

138
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,320
You cheeky monkey.

139
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,720
Maybe a spot of tea ?

140
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,440
A spot of tea.

141
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,120
We do have three accidents
in town this morning.

142
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,960
Cheerio. You know the last time
we spoke with some type of accent,

143
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,120
we made it on HBO.

144
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,480
That's right the John Oliver Show,
yes, maybe we'll do it again.

145
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,920
From the town of Windsor !
Top o' the morning !

146
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,240
Moving on.

147
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,280
Our main story tonight concerns rehab:
the most common place to go

148
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,480
after hitting rock bottom,
other than Dave & Buster's.

149
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,760
Don't let their smiles fool you,
every one of those men

150
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,680
is at the lowest point in their
lives in that photo.

151
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,880
Rehab is a place where people can
address an addiction to drugs, alcohol

152
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,840
something that, until recently,

153
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,440
was seen as a moral failing that could
be overcome with sheer willpower,

154
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,760
perhaps best epitomized
by this amazing PSA from the 80's

155
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,880
starring singer Belinda Carlisle.

156
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,520
I used to do drugs
and one morning I woke up,

157
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,280
I looked in the mirror and said
you look frightening.

158
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,960
I got sick of it so I quit.

159
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,240
And now, life's a beach !

160
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,400
RAD. Rock Against Drugs.

161
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,440
Rad. Incidentally, Belinda Carlisle
has since admitted that,

162
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,280
after that PSA was shot, she used
cocaine for another twenty years,

163
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,000
to a point where, I am quoting her,
"I'm surprised I still have a nose."

164
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,360
Which is the kind of statement
you only normally hear from toddlers

165
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,000
who just spent the afternoon
with their uncle.

166
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,680
"He told me he got it in his fingers,
and I fucking 'flipped' man."

167
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,560
"I was crying, screaming...
I'm surprised I still have a nose."

168
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,280
"Is it still there ?
The guy's fucking crazy !"

169
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,520
Now, thankfully there is now
a broader understanding

170
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,160
that addiction is complex,

171
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,480
and that nothing about getting
off alcohol or drugs is easy.

172
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,760
Experts now view addiction
as a medical problem,

173
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,680
often likened to a disease,
or a chronic condition.

174
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,520
And a common way of treating it
is through stints in rehab.

175
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,800
It is a $35 billion industry,

176
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,640
with over 14,000 rehab facilities
across the United States,

177
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,200
some of which have fancy names
like Promises, Passages or Milestones,

178
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,680
names that sound like perfumes
worn exclusively by widows.

179
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,600
And some rehabs can even afford to run
TV commercials like this.

180
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,520
Cliffside Malibu has been helping
people just like you for over 12 years.

181
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,440
We accept most insurance.

182
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,640
Our experienced, compassionate staff
will help you get your life back.

183
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,120
Call the number
or go to the site below, now.

184
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,760
Don't wait because your tomorrow
may never come.

185
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,320
That is a hard turn there.
That's like Frosted Flakes

186
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,160
ending a commercial with Tony
the Tiger getting shot by poachers.

187
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,000
Now, in recent years,

188
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,160
it has gotten easier
to get insurance to pay for rehab.

189
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,480
That's largely thanks to the fact
that George W. Bush passed,

190
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,120
and Barack Obama expanded,

191
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,640
laws requiring health insurers
to increase coverage for it.

192
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,920
But while we use "rehab" as shorthand,
it is worth knowing

193
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,400
that there is no set definition
for what it should consist of.

194
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,000
There are no federal standards for
counseling practices/rehab programs.

195
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,040
And while many rehabs are staffed
by people doing their best to help,

196
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,480
"the vast majority of people
in need of addiction treatment"

197
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,360
"do not receive anything that
approximates evidence-based care."

198
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,720
And for a sense of just how bad
things can be, look at Florida

199
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,080
a state whose rehab industry has seen
an epidemic of overdose deaths, fraud,

200
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,960
to the point where one local official
issued a chilling warning.

201
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,960
The message would be, stop sending
your loved ones to South Florida

202
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,520
because we're sending them
back in body bags.

203
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,280
Holy shit. That is the worst,

204
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,760
and yet possibly most honest, tourism
slogan for Florida I've ever heard.

205
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,880
"Come to South Florida !
We'll send you home in a body bag."

206
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,520
So let's look at what rehab is,
and why the industry's so troubled.

207
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,720
Rehab should never be seen
as a quick fix.

208
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,320
It's often just the first step
in a lifetime of recovery.

209
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,520
Yet many operators make huge claims
about their success rate.

210
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Take Passages, in Malibu.
The father and son who run it

211
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,960
make some pretty big promises
about what they can do for you.

212
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,600
When you send patients home,
what do you say to them ?

213
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,800
- You're cured.
- Totally cured. Hundred percent.

214
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,560
You will never use drugs
and alcohol again.

215
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,680
Your dependency has been cured,
have a wonderful life.

216
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,880
Bullshit. For a start,
there is no way, when patients leave,

217
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,960
this asshole doesn't say "ciao."

218
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,200
There is no fucking way that sound
doesn't come out of his lips.

219
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,080
But lots of rehabs feel free to make
suspiciously impressive claims,

220
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,800
as one researcher found out.

221
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,280
We called inpatient programs, asked
them what their success rate was.

222
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,880
And the lowest rate
we got quoted was 80 percent.

223
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,160
I do know that about 80 percent
of the clients who have come in here

224
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,040
are now sober, long-term.

225
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,040
We've had about an 80 percent
success rate here at 180.

226
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,280
And then we would ask,
on what data do you base that ?

227
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,960
And no one had any data.

228
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,000
They had no hard data
to back up their claims.

229
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:33,000
But why not say you have
a 140 percent  success rate ?

230
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,720
"For every 10 people that come here,
14 emerge completely sober !"

231
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,280
"Where did those extra four people
come from ? We have no idea !"

232
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,640
That's the thing-rehabs' success rates
are based on selfreported statistics,

233
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,560
involving them simply
calling former clients.

234
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,560
Those results
can be problematic,

235
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,520
as a man who's participated
in one of those studies can tell you.

236
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,720
They call you up
and they ask how you're doing,

237
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,480
and you just lie.

238
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,160
I just said, you know, I'm fine.
You know, but yeah, I was drinking.

239
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,280
Yeah, like, I mean,
it's crazy, you know,

240
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,040
but I was embarrassed to say
I didn't stay sober.

241
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,280
You can kind of understand
that for every reason.

242
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,800
It can be hard to admit
that you've relapsed,

243
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,880
plus, it's a phone call, so you'll say
whatever it takes to make it end.

244
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,000
Getting sober may be hard
but nothing is harder

245
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,160
than an 8-minute phone call
with another human being.

246
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,240
Nothing at all.

247
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,960
For all those claims of success,
it is very hard to know

248
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,520
what you're getting
at any given rehab.

249
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,680
You might get the traditional
12-step-based approach,

250
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,560
which works for some,
although most experts argue

251
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,160
there should also be consistent
access to newer treatments,

252
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,240
like behavioral therapies
or medications like these.

253
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,200
But rehabs
are not required to offer those.

254
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,120
And because a rehab can be
whatever its proprietor says it is,

255
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,360
they can frame almost anything
as treatment.

256
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,160
Many high-end rehabs offer
something called "equine therapy".

257
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,480
If people respond to it,
that's great.

258
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,520
There is no empirical evidence that,
as a treatment for addiction, it works.

259
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,440
Which means some people
who paid a high price for it

260
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,080
can have this experience.

261
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,720
They had the whole equine thing.
You go and fucking pet horses.

262
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,880
What is petting horses
gonna do for me ?

263
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,360
It didn't do a goddamn thing.
I don't even fucking like horses.

264
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:40,120
First of all,
I absolutely love that guy.

265
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,720
Second of all, he's right.
Horses can go straight to hell.

266
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,920
Why do we even need them anymore ?
You could ride one somewhere,

267
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,680
or you could drive a car,
which is like a horse,

268
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,920
except it can play music and
it doesn't shit everywhere.

269
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,160
You're an idiot, Patches.
An idiot.

270
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,520
One of the places that offers
equine therapy is Cliffside,

271
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,800
the place from the ad
you saw earlier.

272
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,280
A month of treatment there
costs tens of thousands of dollars.

273
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,760
Its founder, Richard Taite,
gets defensive

274
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,800
when asked
if it's worth the price.

275
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,960
$73,000 sounds like a lot,

276
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,360
but if you go to the Four Seasons
for 30 days, ok ?

277
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,400
That's gonna be 40 grand.
What did you get ?

278
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,000
Was there any life-changing
thing going on there ?

279
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,400
Everything we've done
here is mindful.

280
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,160
It only seems like horseshit to
people that don't know better.

281
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,760
You don't have to know better,
your life didn't depend on it.

282
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,400
You didn't go through it.

283
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,480
Calm down, bro. You're being
unfair to the Four Seasons.

284
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,200
Plenty of life-changing things
happen there.

285
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,960
Jaden Smith claimed the one
in Toronto

286
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,440
"spiked his pancakes with cheese",
after kicking him out of his room.

287
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,960
And if a handful of Canadians
tricking an evicted child millionaire

288
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,280
with undisclosed ricotta
isn't a "life-changing thing",

289
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,000
I don't know what is anymore.

290
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:10,440
$73,000 sound like a lot,
because it is a lot of money.

291
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,480
You would hope that they could
account for every moment of treatment

292
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,240
but that does not seem
to be the case.

293
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,200
- Where are your patients at today ?
- I don't know. Where are they ?

294
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,880
Where'd they go ?
Rob's not here.

295
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,480
I have no idea.

296
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,200
They probably went to...

297
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,880
Whatever they did,
there's a therapeutic...

298
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,920
... meaning behind it.

299
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,720
Good save, bro. 'Cause you
were in trouble for a minute there,

300
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,800
but the "therapeutic meaning"
line was inspired.

301
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,640
Anything can have
a therapeutic meaning.

302
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,240
His patients are stroking horses ?
Could be therapeutic.

303
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,560
They're biting owls ?
That could be therapeutic.

304
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,720
Even the act of them being lost
could be therapeutic.

305
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,240
It's called "inadvertent wilderness
therapy", 140 per cent successful.

306
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,120
We've just talked about the fancy,
high-end residential facilities.

307
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,240
There are oversight problems
throughout this system,

308
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,520
the barrier to opening
a rehab can be dangerously low.

309
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,360
In Idaho, if you are not operating
a residential program for adolescents,

310
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,120
you don't need a license.

311
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,360
In California, as long as you
take private-pay clients,

312
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,200
anyone can start
an outpatient rehab center.

313
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,880
In Florida, if you want to open
a "sober home",

314
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,960
a group home where people stay,
while receiving outpatient treatment,

315
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,760
there is nothing in state law
to stop you.

316
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,520
O.J. Simpson could open one, which
would be called "The Juice Cleanse",

317
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,000
and there would be nothing
standing in his way.

318
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,880
Florida provides a window into
how the flood of insurance money

319
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,720
caused massive problems,
the industry boomed there

320
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,000
and unscrupulous operators found
it too easy to game the system.

321
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,720
Take urine testing.
Insurance covers drug tests

322
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,920
and some places have
exploited that,

323
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,840
arranging for kickbacks
from testing facilities.

324
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,280
The more urine they take,
the more money they make.

325
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,960
And it adds up fast.

326
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,240
For a single $30 store-bought
urine test,

327
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,560
you could get up to 1,500 dollars
in payouts from insurance companies.

328
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,560
Let's do the math. If you run
five tests a week on a single addict,

329
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,680
that's 7,500 dollars.

330
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,120
6 addicts at 5 tests a week,
$45,000 dollars.

331
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,360
That's over 2.3 million a year.

332
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,440
Exactly. Urine is so valuable
that in the recovery industry,

333
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,360
it is known as "liquid gold".

334
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,400
Peeing liquid gold sounds
like the symptom of an STD

335
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,080
you can only contract
from fucking C-3PO.

336
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:02,280
No, I don't think all women born
after 1990 have it anyway.

337
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,560
Unless you're sleeping with
all women born after 1990, C ?

338
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,960
Are you doing that, C ?
You're a dog, C, you're a metal dog.

339
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,280
With money like that
to be made just from urine,

340
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,360
some have gone to extreme lengths
to attract patients with insurance,

341
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,560
even engaging in something
called "patient brokering"

342
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,120
or "junkie hunting",
here is how that works.

343
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,120
Mercedes Smith,
a recovering addict herself,

344
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,360
told us sober home operators compete
for addicts with good insurance,

345
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,880
enticing them with promises of free
rent, free food, free cigarettes.

346
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,040
We would have to drive
around Delray.

347
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,200
And anybody with suitcases we would
have to ask them:

348
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,440
"Do you have insurance ?
We have a place you can go."

349
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,280
In terms of questions to ask people
from the window of a moving vehicle

350
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,600
"do you have insurance ?"
is barely less sinister than

351
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,360
"would you like some candy ?"
or "what size of flesh are you ?"

352
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,560
It gets grimmer. There can be
more money in a patient relapsing

353
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,160
than in them recovering.

354
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,480
This system encourages a cycle
of admission, relapse,

355
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,480
readmission and relapse again.

356
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,320
Even has its own term,
it's called "the Florida shuffle".

357
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,520
If you are not extremely lucky,
this is how it ends.

358
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,120
In the "Florida shuffle",
you go in and out of recovery,

359
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,160
in and out of rehab centers,
in and out of sober homes,

360
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,720
milking the individual for their
insurance until that person dies.

361
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,360
The Florida shuffle turns out to be
horrific, and not, as I'd assumed,

362
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,280
a party where everyone gets
to fuck their neighbor's alligator.

363
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,040
If at this point you're thinking:

364
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,440
"I need to be extra careful when
I'm looking for treatment",

365
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
that is the final big problem.

366
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,680
It can be nearly impossible to find
good, unbiased information.

367
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,720
Let's say you see this ad,
which plays a lot.

368
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,160
We are the Addiction Network
and if you have a problem

369
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,960
with drugs or alcohol you need
to call the number on your screen now.

370
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,600
Addiction is a disease
and you can't go it alone.

371
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,760
The call is free
and so is the consultation.

372
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,920
So why haven't you called ?

373
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,240
Why haven't you called ?
That is a hostile tone

374
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,480
that you would not
tolerate elsewhere.

375
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,280
Tampax tampons,
why isn't one in you right now ?

376
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,560
Seriously: explain yourself.

377
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,120
The important thing to understand

378
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,800
is that the Addiction Network
is not a rehab.

379
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,000
It is a referrals business,
they make money by routing your call

380
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,160
to centers all over the country, which
pay them $40 to $50 for your call.

381
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,160
Your individual circumstances are not
being taken into account,

382
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,120
they're placing your fate
in the hands of whoever has $50.

383
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,440
Which is a terrible system.
I have $50,

384
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,840
but I have no idea how to
treat someone with an addiction.

385
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,440
I'd give them a copy of my handmade
anti-drug pamphlet, titled:

386
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,480
"Napping With The Devil:
Please Stop Doing Heroin".

387
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,680
If you're thinking: "I wouldn't fall
for a sketchy looking TV ad"

388
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,640
That is great. Let's say that you saw
that Cliffside ad and you thought:

389
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,880
"That looks good, but I do want
to check it myself first."

390
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,840
A Google search will quickly land
you on Rehab-reviews.com,

391
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,280
which says that Cliffside
is the choice for

392
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,200
"those that have to have
the finest of everything."

393
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,560
Or you might land
on "The-fix-dot-com",

394
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,360
whose review raves that it is

395
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,880
"a great choice for anyone who
has the means to recover there."

396
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,600
What you probably won't see
on either of these websites,

397
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,600
is that both of them are
owned by Richard Taite,

398
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,760
the founder of Cliffside Malibu.

399
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,720
The guy who looks like Matt Lauer
fucked a pair of Oakley sunglasses.

400
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:55,080
That fact of ownership certainly
casts some doubt

401
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:00,360
on the fact The Fix awarded Cliffside
a rating of five out of five stars.

402
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,040
One star for every ten patients whose
location he's unaware of.

403
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,480
Let's say someone you love
was truly in crisis

404
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,120
and you wanted information
on Cliffside from an outside source,

405
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,480
like what complaints had
been lodged with the state.

406
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,760
To get that information, you would
need to file a public records request

407
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,880
with California's Department
of Health Care Services

408
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,800
and wait for months for them
to send you what could be

409
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,400
a huge pile of documents.

410
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,320
And that is too long to wait
for urgent information.

411
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,040
It's akin to a pregnancy test

412
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,200
that takes you eight and a half months
to get the results.

413
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,800
That is practically useless
and a huge waste of good urine

414
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,920
which as I now understand it
is liquid gold.

415
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,680
Everything about this industry is
incredibly difficult to navigate.

416
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,280
Even one of its own trade groups
has warned

417
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,840
that some sectors of it
are "out of control".

418
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,480
For a sense of how helpless you can
be in the face of all this,

419
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,600
listen to Tom McClellan,
Obama's deputy drug czar.

420
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,600
You would think that, if anyone
knows this world, it would be him.

421
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,240
Guess what ?

422
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,120
I had become an expert
in the addiction field.

423
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:20,320
And then my son became addicted,
and I had no idea what to do.

424
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,480
All that training, all that knowledge
about addiction did not prepare me

425
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,440
for the most fundamental
question of all.

426
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,920
Where do you send
your kid for treatment ?

427
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:37,240
Even the nation's deputy drug czar
couldn't navigate this system.

428
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,200
The tragedy is, his son died.

429
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,640
Remember the funny
guy who hated horses ? He died, too.

430
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,200
So this is a matter
of life and death.

431
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,800
If you're wondering what experts would
advise you to do in seeking treatment,

432
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,640
many suggested beginning
not with a rehab,

433
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:58,560
but with a doctor who is board
certified in addiction medicine.

434
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,800
It recently become a specialty,
so there aren't many of them around,

435
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,920
but you can find those
that exist at this website.

436
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,480
They may be able to guide you
toward a treatment,

437
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,840
which might well not be
a fancy center

438
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,080
where you have to pay $73,000
to have this guy lose you.

439
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,840
This system needs more expertise
and oversight.

440
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,800
Until then, it may be really important
for all of us to understand that,

441
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,120
the word "rehab"
is so broadly defined

442
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,080
as to be close to meaningless.

443
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,040
It is honestly barely better
defined than the word "building".

444
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,360
If someone were to tell you:
"I have a drug problem,"

445
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,320
"but don't worry,
I'm going to building in Florida",

446
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,280
you would naturally say:
"hold on, what building ?"

447
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,240
Where did you find this building ?
Is it a hospital, or a Hooters ?

448
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,480
Or both, is it a Hootspital ?

449
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,320
What's the proof it works ? What's
the doctor-to-horse ratio like there ?

450
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,440
Now, it can be way too difficult
to get answers to those questions.

451
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,200
So much about battling
addiction is really hard.

452
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,520
Getting clean is hard.
Staying clean is hard.

453
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,160
But getting good, evidence-based,
trustworthy help

454
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,400
should be the easy part.

455
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:28,600
Now it is way to easy to literally
wind up pissing money up a wall.

456
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,320
And now this.

457
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,960
Just look at this bunch
of Royal Wedding shit.

458
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,120
KFC making sure to get
in on the Royal Wedding.

459
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,760
They're calling it
the Royal Wedding bucket.

460
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,120
Burger King has launched
a new sandwich.

461
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,200
Two onion rings, signifying
the royal matrimony.

462
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,480
Velveeta, they've got crown
shaped pasta and cheese.

463
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,240
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle
Pez dispensers.

464
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,240
- Harry and Meghan paper dolls.
- Bobble heads.

465
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,520
- Crown jewels condoms.
- That just looks creepy.

466
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,160
- Weird earrings.
- One on each lobe.

467
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,080
If you want a more classy biscuit,
45 pounds for the tin,

468
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,520
but they're really beautiful.

469
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,160
Like these, who wouldn't
want these bathing suits ?

470
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,520
There's nothing flattering
about that.

471
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,000
It's where the beard is.
It's the beard that's not right.

472
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,600
That's our show. We're off next
week, we'll be back after that.

473
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,600
Thanks for watching,
good night !

474
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,840
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

475
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,240
END OF EPISODE 12,
SEASON V
