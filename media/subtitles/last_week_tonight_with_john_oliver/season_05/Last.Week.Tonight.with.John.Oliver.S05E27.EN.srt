00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,960
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,440
SEASON V
EPISODE 27

3
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,800
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,400
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,240
A quick recap of the week.
It was particularly grim,

6
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,160
with yesterday's attack leaving
11 dead at a Pittsburgh synagogue.

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,800
Days after a racially-motivated
shooting in Louisville

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,320
and a series of package bombs sent
to critics of Trump.

9
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,080
It has been a time for sober reflection
or, if you are Fox News

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,000
discussing those package bombs,
a time for wild speculation.

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,240
Before the suspect was arrested,
they had a ludicrous theory.

12
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,200
You talked in your notes about the
potential it could be a false flag.

13
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,400
We cannot rule out that
it's a false flag operation.

14
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,280
I feel these are
false flag bombings.

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,800
At the risk of sounding
like a far right-wing lunatic,

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,680
I believe this whole thing
was an elaborate hoax.

17
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,520
"Sounding like a far rightwing
lunatic" is not really a risk

18
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,400
for the Fox News brand, is it ?

19
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,880
It's more of a guarantee.
It'd be like if Tony Bennett

20
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,480
started every song with "at the risk
of making your grandma wet".

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,320
We all know that's going to happen,
it's what you're here to do.

22
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,560
Once the suspect was found,
it was clear that the bombs were real

23
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,120
and that he was
a Trump supporter,

24
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,000
Geraldo apologized:

25
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,280
"Never mind; outsmarted myself in
conjuring false flag operation".

26
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,160
"Outsmarted myself" is a brilliant way

27
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,960
to say that you did something
incredibly stupid.

28
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,200
I outsmarted myself when I accidentally
ate kitty litter instead of Grape-Nuts.

29
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,880
I remember thinking
as I chewed the clumps:

30
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,920
"I truly am two steps
ahead of me !"

31
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,240
Even after the suspect's
motivations were clear,

32
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,520
some Trump supporters insisted
there was more to this story.

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,600
Barack Obama probably
sent his to himself

34
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,760
and Hillary Clinton
probably sent hers to herself.

35
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,240
You don't think this guy sent
these bombs to these officials ?

36
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,760
- No. Probably not.
- Why ?

37
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,400
- They may have paid him to do it.
- What would be the upside ?

38
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,680
Trying to bring people,
feeling, over to their side.

39
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,480
- Against Trump ?
- Yeah.

40
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,480
Obama flew to Florida, mailed a bomb
to himself in Washington,

41
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,640
then flew back in time to avoid it,
all to frame this guy.

42
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,440
I'm not saying that that man's
theory doesn't have any holes in it,

43
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,400
but we can all agree:
he outsmarted Geraldo Rivera.

44
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,200
Let's move on to Saudi Arabia.
The country with bans on pork,

45
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,240
alcohol and porn, or as it's known
in America: a "Florida breakfast".

46
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,280
Saudi Arabia is continuing to deal with
the fallout from the death of Khashoggi

47
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,240
who disappeared after entering
Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul,

48
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,480
which also contained 15 Saudi
operatives who'd flown in

49
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,480
with an autopsy
specialist and a bone saw.

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,680
The Saudis initially insisted
Khashoggi had left the embassy alive,

51
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,280
but now admit that they'd incorrectly
remembered what happened

52
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,120
or "dismembered",
if you will.

53
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,080
Their story became that he'd been
killed, but for good reason.

54
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,320
They say discussions led to a brawl
and he died in a fistfight.

55
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,360
Yeah, a fistfight. It started when
they had a disagreement

56
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,920
over whether or not Khashoggi
should be murdered in cold blood.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,480
He didn't think so, but the Saudis
were adamant it was a good idea

58
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,480
and one thing
just led to another.

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,360
This story was, as Khashoggi's
editor at "The Post" tweeted,

60
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,120
"utter bullshit" which should also be
the new term that The Post uses

61
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,120
when fact checking politicians.

62
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,120
It's better than using their current
system of one to four Pinocchios.

63
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,240
You're a journalistic institution,

64
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,880
why are you using a dishonest wood
demon from a children's story ?

65
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,280
Now the Saudis then abandoned
that story and suggested

66
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,400
killing may have been "premeditated",
which was obvious from the start.

67
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,400
Especially as it now appears the killers
had the laziest of strategies

68
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,920
to convince people that Khashoggi
left the consulate safely.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,640
CNN aired what appears
to be surveillance video

70
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,400
described to them as one suspect
dressed in Khashoggi's clothes,

71
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,840
even apparently a fake beard.

72
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,560
That is pathetic.
Khashoggi is bald

73
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,000
and the body double
has a full head of hair.

74
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,520
If you're picking a body double,
make sure they look like that person.

75
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,320
That is why my body
double is this owl.

76
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,680
The resemblance is uncanny !

77
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,720
You can't even tell
which one is the real owl !

78
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,520
This horrific situation has put Trump
in a difficult position.

79
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,960
He is close to the Saudi leadership
and has been bending over backwards

80
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,000
to try and excuse what happened.

81
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,240
Even as the Saudis'
story unraveled,

82
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,760
he unleashed a critique that can
only be described as very weird.

83
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:37,960
They had a bad original concept.
It was carried out poorly.

84
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,520
And the cover-up was one of
the worst in the history of cover-ups.

85
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,800
It's very simple.

86
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,800
"A very bad original concept ?"

87
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,720
You're the president addressing the
assassination of a resident of the US,

88
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,680
not a Netflix executive deciding
whether to green light a new series.

89
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,360
Even if you were, everyone knows
the Netflix development motto

90
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,680
is "There Are
No Bad Original Concepts."

91
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,360
Businesses with ties to Saudi
Arabia have now come in for scrutiny,

92
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,840
including the WWE, who signed
a 10-year deal to stage events there

93
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,680
and who staged the
"Greatest Royal Rumble" in Jeddah,

94
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,960
a wall-to-wall propaganda
for the Saudi government.

95
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,800
There was a clip from that event
that we didn't have time to show you,

96
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,080
involving wrestler Titus O'Neil,
who ran into the arena,

97
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,480
to jump into the ring.

98
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,600
What you're about to see
was not staged.

99
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,800
Titus had a very busy week
here in Saudi Arabia.

100
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,480
He's had dinner with many princes
and very important people...

101
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,880
What the heck ?

102
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:50,120
There isn't any better encapsulation of
WWE's relationship with Saudi Arabia

103
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,280
than a wrestler meeting princes
before falling flat on his face.

104
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:02,000
WWE has their next event in Saudi
Arabia, "Crown Jewel", this Friday.

105
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,280
They've been
under real pressure to cancel it.

106
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,120
There are even unconfirmed
reports that John Cena

107
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,960
wants to pull out of the event.

108
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,240
Wrestling fans have been uncomfortable
with this whole Saudi deal.

109
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,120
Listen to a crowd that is cheering
for The Undertaker,

110
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,320
suddenly take a turn
when he brings up Crown Jewel.

111
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,720
Undertaker !

112
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,800
Fifteen-thousand strong chanting
on their feet for the Phenom.

113
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,400
At Crown Jewel...

114
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:49,560
Holy shit ! I think
the WWE itself just turned heel.

115
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:55,040
Do you know how deeply bad something
has to be to get wrestling fans to boo

116
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,400
a wrestling event
at a wrestling event ?

117
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,200
That is the type of crowd reaction
that you'd expect to hear

118
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,000
if the WWE championship
was suddenly won by Beck.

119
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,840
Which is totally plausible.
The guy's a scientologist.

120
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,160
And they give you superpowers.
It's not just a religion,

121
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,480
it's a set of principles to help you
improve your life and maybe fly.

122
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,760
Just look into it, that's all
I'm compelling you sincerely.

123
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,360
Despite all the criticism,

124
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,520
the WWE is going full steam
ahead with Crown Jewel,

125
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,160
in partnership with a country that
just murdered and dismembered

126
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,440
a journalist
for "The Washington Post".

127
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,360
Their promotion for it
has been a little tone-deaf,

128
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,280
such as this actual Instagram post
featuring a funeral urn,

129
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,160
which was initially captioned:

130
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,880
"Respect is out the window
at #WWECrownJewel."

131
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,600
That is insensitive, but also,
it is kind of nonsense,

132
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,640
the urn is referring to The Undertaker,
but that's not his catchphrase.

133
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,720
His catchphrase is:

134
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,320
"I'm a big beef ghost here to drive you
to hell. I'm a beef ghost !"

135
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,840
That's what
he says when he wrestles.

136
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,920
It is not going to be easy for the WWE
to thread the needle on this.

137
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,080
They are pushing ahead despite
the concerns of wrestlers

138
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,640
and their own fan base.

139
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,560
But since they have clearly
picked a lane here,

140
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,440
they may as well just say "fuck it"
and air something like this.

141
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,720
On November 2nd it's Crown Jewel.
Live from Saudi Arabia,

142
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,360
featuring Brock Lesnar,
A.J. Styles, The Undertaker,

143
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,560
no female wrestlers,
they're not allowed to perform

144
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,960
and maybe John Cena, if he's
willing to take a major PR hit.

145
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Forget everything
you've seen on the news,

146
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,280
and watch the Brothers of Destruction
leave their opponents dead and buried.

147
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,320
Sorry, poor choice of words.
Someone is going to rest in pieces.

148
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,760
Nope, hang on.

149
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,280
Someone is gonna be ambushed
and mutilated with a bone saw...

150
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,040
You know what ? Never mind.
Point is, next Friday at Crown Jewel,

151
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,120
respect is out the window.

152
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,960
If you care about human rights,
then WWE's got two words for ya:

153
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,760
suck it !

154
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,400
Moving on...

155
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,640
Our main story tonight
concerns state attorneys general.

156
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,840
That is the correct plural
and if you already knew that:

157
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,960
I'm sorry that high school
was such a rough time for you.

158
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,120
Believe me, I know: being
a teenage grammar nerd

159
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,160
is something from which
it is difficult to recover.

160
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,560
I realize that a show about state
AGs sounds like a tedious prospect.

161
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,080
Watch the start of this 2006 panel
discussion on C-SPAN,

162
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,400
in front of an electrified crowd.

163
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,640
Our panel today features
three distinguished

164
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:04,720
and very different and
bipartisan attorneys general.

165
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,400
I gotta say that was a bit of a dick
move by the C-SPAN cameraman.

166
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,840
He didn't have to pan
across those empty seats,

167
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,760
but he did it anyway,
as if to say:

168
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,440
"Even the panel's friends
didn't show up !"

169
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,440
I'll tell you what that panel
did wrong:

170
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,040
if you want a live audience to listen
to you talk about state AGs,

171
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,760
don't tell them in advance.

172
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,400
We film this show in front
of a live audience.

173
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,040
You think we told them what this
show's about ? Of course not !

174
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,560
They were told that this was
a taping of "The Rachael Ray Show".

175
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,120
I promise:
she'll be out any minute now.

176
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,280
It is worth the effort
to learn about state AGs.

177
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,760
They are very important and most of
us probably don't know who ours is.

178
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,640
If you live in Indiana, I am very
excited to introduce you to yours.

179
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,080
Meet Curtis Hill:
AG by day, although by night,

180
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,240
something very much different.

181
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,480
I was toying around with it

182
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,160
and discovered
that I sounded sort of like Elvis.

183
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,200
We're caught in a trap,
I can't walk out,

184
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,480
Because I love you too much, baby.

185
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,800
We saw the attorney general
do all the hits.

186
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,880
I don't look much like Elvis.

187
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,520
I hadn't, to be honest,
I hadn't noticed that.

188
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,400
It's difficult to notice anything
besides the most sadistic inseam

189
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,280
in the history of tailoring.

190
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,080
That looks like a marshmallow
bisected with fishing wire

191
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,800
and that's all it looks like.

192
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,400
Most state AGs are elected, meaning
they belong to political parties

193
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,120
and they run campaign ads,
like this striking one from Michigan.

194
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,960
When you're choosing
Michigan's next attorney general,

195
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,240
ask yourself this:

196
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,280
who can you trust most not to show
their penis in a professional setting ?

197
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,800
Is it the candidate who doesn't
have a penis ? I'd say so.

198
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:10,240
That is an argument.
If you are asking me which candidate

199
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,680
I trust not to show me their penis,
I'd have to go with dickless Dennis.

200
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,160
He can't show me his penis.
Why ?

201
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,520
That mean old raccoon still has it !

202
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,840
That woman is running for
attorney general in Michigan.

203
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,360
It's one of 30 states where voters
will be selecting their next AG.

204
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,560
Those elections are going
to be unusually competitive.

205
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,280
Some estimate that
more than $100 million

206
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,320
will be spent on AG races this year,

207
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,240
that's up to three
times more than ever before.

208
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,200
Let's look at who AGs are, what
they do and why they matter.

209
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,720
Typically, they serve as a state's
chief legal officer and people's lawyer

210
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,320
with responsibilities ranging from
criminal law enforcement

211
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,200
to consumer advocacy
and everything in between.

212
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,560
The landmark, multi-billion-dollar
tobacco industry settlement in the '90s

213
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,480
that killed Joe Camel,
that was thanks to state AGs.

214
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,680
Report on abuses by the
Catholic Church in Pennsylvania ?

215
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,520
That was thanks to a state AG.

216
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,800
Who put out that
raging wildfire in northern California ?

217
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,120
That was firefighters.
Use your head.

218
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,760
Why would state AGs have been
involved ? Use your instincts here.

219
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:25,400
AGs often work on politically
neutral matters. And they still do.

220
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,920
In recent decades, they've become
significantly more partisan.

221
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,800
One small sign of this is that while
all AGs belong

222
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,280
to the National Association
of Attorneys General or "NAAG",

223
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,680
two decades ago, Republicans
formed a committee just for them,

224
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,760
RAGA, and the Democrats
followed suit, with DAGA.

225
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,000
I know that RAGA and DAGA sound
like twins from Dutch folklore

226
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,520
that teach children
about right and wrong.

227
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,280
Raga always milks the cow
when its udders are swollen,

228
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,920
but Daga is off making
nonsense with a goose.

229
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,280
When Daga is given no dinner,
this is justice.

230
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,800
The most high-profile way in which
this job has become more partisan

231
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,120
is the extent to which AGs belonging
to one party teamed up

232
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,040
to bring lawsuits against
the federal government.

233
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,720
That used to be relatively rare,
but starting in the Obama years,

234
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,600
the number of those sort
of lawsuits skyrocketed.

235
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:25,320
It was Republican AGs who limited
the Medicaid expansion of Obamacare

236
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,360
and suing the government became
a pride for AGs like Greg Abbott.

237
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,720
What I do is I go into the office,

238
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,200
I sue the federal government
and then I go home.

239
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,840
I've sued the Obama administration
25 times over the last four years.

240
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,160
That is not the smirk of a guy
who just goes into the office,

241
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,280
sues the government
and goes home !

242
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,600
That's a guy who goes into
the office, sues the government,

243
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,360
adjusts the office thermostat
without telling,

244
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,280
steals someone's sandwich, farts in
the elevator and then goes home.

245
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,280
Abbott has since gone on
to become governor of Texas,

246
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,680
his successor Ken Paxton was no less
eager to sue the Obama administration.

247
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,080
Just listen to his wife, proudly
describing Paxton's love for lawsuits

248
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,600
in what apparently
I legally have to call a song.

249
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,720
I'm a pistol packin' mama,
yes I am.

250
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,320
I'm a pistol packin' mama,
yes I am.

251
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,480
I'm a pistol packin' mama,
And my husband sues Obama.

252
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,680
I'm a pistol packin' mama,
yes I am.

253
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,160
I never thought I would say this,

254
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,560
but I would honestly rather
listen to Moose-knuckle Elvis,

255
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,440
Shirley Temple-ing it up in his
living room in a tootight onesie.

256
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,240
Paxton is a really good example
of how a state AG's political views

257
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,160
can impact their work.

258
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,600
He told county clerks

259
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,480
they could refuse to issue
marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

260
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,280
He was a lead plaintiff in a lawsuit
that shot down an Obama-era rule

261
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,920
that would've made 4 million
people eligible for overtime pay.

262
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,400
When Obama tried to extend protections
for transgender kids in public schools,

263
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,280
Paxton sued and said this.

264
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,480
Any man that decides they want
to declare themselves to be female,

265
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,760
can walk into your daughter's
locker room or bathroom.

266
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,320
It now opens the door for anybody,
no matter what they are,

267
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:27,520
they can change their gender and
walk into a women's locker room.

268
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,720
It's not right.

269
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,640
What are you talking about ?
Obvious bigotry aside,

270
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,400
transgender people don't just
switch identity for convenience.

271
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,280
They are human beings,
not reed frogs.

272
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,480
Reed frogs, should the need arise,
can change from female to male.

273
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,040
I hit you with an unexpected frog fact

274
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,560
in the middle of talking
about state AGs.

275
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,720
I know you're thinking:
"Where is Rachael Ray ?"

276
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,400
If she's not here in the next five
minutes, I'm gonna riot.

277
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,480
Be patient,
she'll be here.

278
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,160
She's making fritattas,
and you're all going to have a taste !

279
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,200
She'll be here, just be patient.

280
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,520
Paxton has spent almost his entire time
in office under indictment

281
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,120
and is awaiting trial
for securities fraud.

282
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,120
That is not the Ken Paxton-related
allegation I would like to show you.

283
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,720
I'd like to focus on one mentioned
in an attack ad from his opponent.

284
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,640
This is the Collin County
Courthouse,

285
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,360
where a Dallas attorney left
a $1 000 pen at the metal detectors.

286
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,360
This is Ken Paxton,
the indicted Texas attorney general,

287
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,400
rummaging through the trays
and stealing that $1 000 pen.

288
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,280
And this is Ken Paxton,
the indicted Texas attorney general,

289
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,920
walking away with a stolen pen.

290
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,600
Vote Justin Nelson for Texas
attorney general.

291
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,120
He will fight on behalf of all Texans
and he won't steal your pen.

292
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,080
I guess that's a relief.
Thanks to that ad earlier,

293
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,800
I would also like to know he won't
steal my pen or show me his penis.

294
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,320
Or, for that matter, show me
his pen or steal my penis.

295
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,280
I need to know his positions on
the penis-pen show-steal continuum.

296
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,120
State AGs are increasingly partisan.

297
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,160
When you look at how Ken Paxton
has used his power,

298
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,240
it is hard not to think
that that is a bad thing.

299
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:29,360
Partisanship can cut both ways.
And now that Trump is in office,

300
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,000
Democratic state AGs file
lawsuits against the president.

301
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,200
While you may've been unhappy
to hear people cheer

302
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,320
for that pistol-packin'
mama's husband suing Obama,

303
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,120
it might feel different hearing the
Democratic AG of Washington say this.

304
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,640
Since Trump became president

305
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,720
we've filed 19 lawsuits
against the administration.

306
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,640
What do you say to people who think
you have an axe to grind against him ?

307
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,640
I plead guilty. I do.
I don't know what to say.

308
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,600
It's interesting how your feelings
on suing the government can change

309
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,160
based on who is saying it.

310
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,000
It's like how "I'm getting off here"
is a fine thing for someone to say

311
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,680
if they're standing next to the door
of a train,

312
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,640
but a very rude thing to say if they
are masturbating on that same train.

313
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,080
State AGs have a lot of power.

314
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,760
While many of us may
not have been aware of that,

315
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,440
corporations and other special
interests certainly have,

316
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,040
because both RAGA and DAGA have
been aggressive about raising funds.

317
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,600
One way they do that
is by organizing events,

318
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,320
where they sell access to AGs.

319
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,840
RAGA has some pretty lavish getaways,
where industries can mingle

320
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,160
with the AGs who are supposed
to be policing them,

321
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,080
as CBS found when it spied
on one in South Carolina.

322
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,680
We saw at least nine state AGs
rubbing shoulders

323
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,280
with representatives from
Koch Industries, Big Tobacco,

324
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,840
payday lenders and the NRA.

325
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,360
The dress code: resort casual.

326
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,680
CBS News reviewed 88 donations
over $50 000

327
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,960
and found more than half of the donors
had matters under consideration

328
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,320
by a state attorney general
or had recently settled.

329
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,640
RAGA says there is
no quid pro quo there.

330
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,480
So I guess those groups simply donated
substantial amounts of money

331
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,360
because they wanted to chillax
to the max at a resort casual clambake

332
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,800
with North Dakota
Attorney General, Wayne Stenehjem.

333
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,240
He's not just the AG of North Dakota,
he's the mayor of Margaritaville.

334
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,200
Wayne parties fucking hard,
he's an animal.

335
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,760
Some state AGs have been cozy
with corporations.

336
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,400
Take Scott Pruitt,
former head of the EPA.

337
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,960
He served as Oklahoma's AG,

338
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,360
where he had a close relationship
with energy companies.

339
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,000
He sued the EPA 14 times

340
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,760
and wrote the agency about policies
that threatened to impact

341
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,360
local oil companies
like Devon Energy.

342
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,560
When a reporter obtained copies
of Pruitt's correspondence with Devon,

343
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,480
he noticed a weird coincidence.

344
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,600
The letters that Scott Pruitt
had written were identical copies

345
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,920
of the draft letters
that Devon had sent him.

346
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,760
He had taken those letters
and simply put 'em on a stationery

347
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,520
and sent them in as if they were
the state law enforcement opinion.

348
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,480
And I was, like "holy...".

349
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,760
Exactly, like he said:
holy motherfucker.

350
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:33,360
That looks like Pruitt let an oil
company do his work for him.

351
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,480
Maybe he happened to think up
the exact same words,

352
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,640
in the exact same order
that they did.

353
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,160
Maybe you find that plausible.
I find it about as plausible

354
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,720
as I do the idea that the family
in "A Quiet Place" stayed silent

355
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,440
for 472 days.

356
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,480
No one farted
for more than a year !

357
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,520
That should be the title of the movie
because that is incredible !

358
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,760
State AGs are powerful,
increasingly partisan,

359
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,560
and over half of them
are on the ballot this year.

360
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,640
Republicans are very
much ready for this fight,

361
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,840
as Arkansas state AG and chair of
RAGA, Leslie Rutledge, will tell you.

362
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:16,120
When it comes to the Democratic AGs,
I can't speak to what they do.

363
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,800
They raise a heck of a lot less
money than the Republican AGs do

364
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,800
because we have been crushing it.

365
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,040
Again, bit of a dick move
by the C-SPAN cameraman there,

366
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,280
undercutting her claims of crushing it
with a cruel cutaway

367
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,440
to her audience
Candy-Crushing it.

368
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,400
She is right:
RAGA is really out-raising DAGA

369
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,360
and they are now locked
in an arms race for funds.

370
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,400
Which just cannot be the healthiest
way for this system to operate.

371
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,960
Naughty Raga ! Naughty Daga !
If you keep behaving like that,

372
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,400
your parents will sell you to
the sea witch like your sisters !

373
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:00,120
Rutledge is one of the AGs up for
election on November 6th,

374
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,920
as is possible pen thief
Ken Paxton.

375
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,840
If you live in any
of these highlighted states,

376
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,160
you have got an AG race
to vote for.

377
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,440
It is worth taking a few minutes
to research the candidates.

378
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,840
Especially because many people
who do actually vote

379
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,680
end up leaving the AG box
on the ballot empty,

380
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,960
so your vote for AG may
technically be more valuable.

381
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,000
In Texas, one poll showed that
39 percent of registered voters

382
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,080
didn't name who that they
would vote for for AG,

383
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,640
because they, and I quote:
"haven't thought enough about it."

384
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,280
Which sounds terrible, but that's
a cause for genuine hope.

385
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,280
That is where
Ken Paxton is running.

386
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,040
And if there is one thing sure
to damage Ken Paxton's reputation,

387
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,760
it's an awareness
of Ken Paxton's reputation.

388
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,040
Please, before November 6th,
think about your AG race.

389
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,120
You can do it.
You've got nine days left.

390
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,320
I know we've all been asked
to think about a lot this year,

391
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,080
from Supreme Court nominations
to gun control,

392
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,480
to the energy
of Pete Davidson's penis.

393
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:10,200
It's been a lot and now I am adding
"research your state AG race".

394
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,800
But it is worth it.
Also, if you do it,

395
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,120
you'll be amazed at the kind
of tidbits that you might find.

396
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,080
If you live in Wisconsin,
Google "Brad Schimel $10 000 coins"

397
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,080
and you'll learn about how your AG
spent 10 grand of taxpayer money

398
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,840
on coins reading "K.A.E.D." which
stands for his personal motto:

399
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,600
"Kicking Ass Every Day."

400
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,280
If you live in Arkansas, Google
"Leslie Rutledge karaoke 2016",

401
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,600
so you can see our friend from before
"crushing it" onstage.

402
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:48,280
I think his tractor's sexy,
It really turns me on,

403
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm always starin' at him,
When he's chuggin' along.

404
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,720
Sing it, Leslie, sing it !

405
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,000
Did that guy just say
"sing it, Leslie ?"

406
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:08,200
I think that might be an honest plea.
Sing it, Leslie. Sing it !

407
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,000
Don't drone it arrhythmically
at an inconsistent volume.

408
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,440
The band's in "E major"
and you're in "H".

409
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,720
Try and bring it into
the known musical universe, Leslie.

410
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,520
If you're in Michigan,
and even if you are not,

411
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,840
Google "Bill Schuette 1989 video".

412
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,000
He is their current AG,
but he's not up for election,

413
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,600
he's running for governor,
but it is still worth Googling that,

414
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,320
so you can watch him creepily
hitting on a woman behind the camera.

415
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,800
Would you please
move closer to the lamp ?

416
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,280
I would be happy to move
closer to the lamp.

417
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,440
I will do anything you want.

418
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,800
Some things I may not
let you run the camera on.

419
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,960
I admire your tenacity, appreciate
your spirit of Vincent Van Gogh,

420
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,680
Rembrandt and Toulouse-Lautrec.

421
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:05,920
That is roughgh to watch. I don't know
how she got throughgh the interview

422
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,000
without punching him in the dighgh.

423
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:17,200
Taking just two minutes
to research your state AG

424
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,200
is a valuable use of your time.

425
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,760
And if you are thinking that
you don't have two minutes, you do.

426
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,280
It's 11:28 right now. I'm not
saying goodbye until 11:30.

427
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,240
So go to Vote 4-1-1-dot-org now,
where you can find out

428
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,200
if there is an election in your state,
and who your AG candidates are.

429
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,600
Do it now. You will not
be missing anything.

430
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,480
Nothing entertaining is going to
happen for the rest of this show.

431
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,800
To help drive you away,
for the rest of the broadcast,

432
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,480
a bagpiper will be playing
Leslie Rutledge's favorite song:

433
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,360
"She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy."

434
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,960
Take it away.

435
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,080
God. Yes, believe it or not,

436
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,480
the bagpipes make this song even
more unlistenable than it already is.

437
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,080
That is an ungodly noise,
no disrespect.

438
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,720
Turn this show off now
and research your AG.

439
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,720
If you haven't already
been repelled into action,

440
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,080
I'll happily add
an accordion into the mix.

441
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:30,440
Yes, the sweet, sweet sound
of a bagpipe-accordion duet.

442
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,800
Two sounds that go
together like Pop-Tarts and fish.

443
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:41,800
Go to Vote 4-1-1-dot-org now,
this just isn't gonna get any better.

444
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,840
Don't fucking push me on this.
You think I won't add a theremin ?

445
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,440
Think again, motherfuckers.
Don't try me.

446
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,560
You shouldn't be watching
this show anymore.

447
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,000
I'm slightly disappointed
our live audience is still here.

448
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,240
Rachael Ray is not coming tonight !
You've been betrayed !

449
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,680
There were never
going to be frittatas !

450
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,320
But I'll tell you who is coming,
though:

451
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,840
six children playing the recorder !

452
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:14,600
How are you somehow the worst
ingredient in all this ?

453
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:20,160
Go research your AGs, because
these guys are about to get louder !

454
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,120
That is our show.
Thank you for watching.

455
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,400
See you next week. Good night !
My god !

456
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,560
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

457
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,720
END OF EPISODE 27,
SEASON V
