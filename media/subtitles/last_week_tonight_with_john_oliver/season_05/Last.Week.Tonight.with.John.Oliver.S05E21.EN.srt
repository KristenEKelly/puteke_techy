1
00:00:31,476 --> 00:00:33,176
Welcome, welcome, welcome

2
00:00:33,276 --> 00:00:34,376
to "Last Week Tonight."

3
00:00:34,476 --> 00:00:35,176
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:35,276 --> 00:00:36,676
Thanks so much for joining us.

5
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:39,676
And we begin this evening
with Rudy Giuliani,

6
00:00:39,776 --> 00:00:40,776
the President's lawyer,

7
00:00:40,876 --> 00:00:43,076
and a one-man legal improv troupe.

8
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:45,376
Giuliani was on TV this morning,

9
00:00:45,476 --> 00:00:47,376
to talk about the ongoing
Mueller investigation,

10
00:00:47,476 --> 00:00:48,676
and came up with a rationale

11
00:00:48,776 --> 00:00:50,676
for his boss's refusal
to sit down with Mueller

12
00:00:50,776 --> 00:00:52,776
that was, even by Giuliani standards,

13
00:00:52,876 --> 00:00:54,476
very "Giuliani".

14
00:00:54,976 --> 00:00:57,176
When you tell me
that he should testify

15
00:00:57,276 --> 00:00:58,876
because he's going
to tell the truth,

16
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,876
that he shouldn't worry,
well that's so silly,

17
00:01:00,976 --> 00:01:02,876
because it's somebody's
version of the truth,

18
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,776
not the truth.

19
00:01:03,876 --> 00:01:06,976
- He didn't have a conversation about...
- Truth is truth.

20
00:01:07,076 --> 00:01:08,276
I don't mean to go, like...

21
00:01:08,376 --> 00:01:09,296
No, it isn't truth!

22
00:01:09,396 --> 00:01:10,196
Truth isn't truth!

23
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:12,096
The president of
the United States says

24
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:14,196
- "I didn't..."
- Truth isn't truth?

25
00:01:14,296 --> 00:01:16,796
Mr. Mayor, do you realize what that...

26
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:18,096
No, no, no.

27
00:01:18,196 --> 00:01:20,796
Don't do this to me.

28
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,796
Don't do this to you?

29
00:01:22,896 --> 00:01:25,496
You just said "Truth isn't truth".

30
00:01:25,596 --> 00:01:28,296
That's not acceptable
from a President's lawyer.

31
00:01:28,396 --> 00:01:31,096
It's barely acceptable from
a sophomore philosophy major,

32
00:01:31,196 --> 00:01:33,596
who just tried Molly
for the first time.

33
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,896
"Truth isn't truth man, and also

34
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:37,296
toes are just feet fingers."

35
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:38,496
"I feel warm!"

36
00:01:38,596 --> 00:01:40,996
And, look, in fairness to Giuliani,

37
00:01:41,096 --> 00:01:42,796
the Ken Bone of 9/11,

38
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:46,196
that was not the dumbest thing
he said in that interview.

39
00:01:46,296 --> 00:01:48,996
Because just watch, Giuliani,
the President's lawyer,

40
00:01:49,096 --> 00:01:52,496
whose job is essentially to try and
dismiss potentially damning evidence,

41
00:01:52,596 --> 00:01:55,596
like the Trump Tower meeting,
basically do the exact opposite.

42
00:01:55,996 --> 00:01:57,596
The trump tower meeting itself

43
00:01:57,696 --> 00:02:02,796
is at least evidence
of you better investigate.

44
00:02:02,896 --> 00:02:04,296
- It's a...
- It's not.

45
00:02:04,396 --> 00:02:05,396
How is it not?

46
00:02:05,496 --> 00:02:08,996
Because the meeting was originally
for the purpose of

47
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,696
getting information about Clinton.

48
00:02:11,796 --> 00:02:15,696
- The meeting turned into a meeting...
- Which in itself is an attempt at collusion.

49
00:02:15,796 --> 00:02:17,096
- It's not.
- You just said it.

50
00:02:17,196 --> 00:02:20,096
The meet was intended
to get dirt on Hillary Clinton

51
00:02:20,196 --> 00:02:21,496
- from a Kremlin lawyer.
- No, no.

52
00:02:21,596 --> 00:02:24,096
That was the intention of the meeting.
You just said it.

53
00:02:24,196 --> 00:02:26,196
What's Rudy Giuliani doing?

54
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:29,396
And why does the White House
keep letting him go on TV?

55
00:02:29,496 --> 00:02:31,096
Because at this rate,

56
00:02:31,196 --> 00:02:32,896
Trump is going to wind up
behind bars,

57
00:02:32,996 --> 00:02:34,596
with Giuliani visiting him
and saying,

58
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,696
"Don´t worry, Donald.
Prison isn't prison."

59
00:02:36,796 --> 00:02:39,496
But let's not get sucked
in to all that.

60
00:02:39,596 --> 00:02:41,496
Instead, let's turn to Australia,

61
00:02:41,596 --> 00:02:42,896
home of every animal

62
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,996
that seems like it should
already be extinct.

63
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:46,696
How is the platypus still alive?

64
00:02:46,802 --> 00:02:47,802
It looks like something

65
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:50,202
Fred Flintstone would have used
as a swiss army knife.

66
00:02:50,302 --> 00:02:52,002
Australian politics this week

67
00:02:52,102 --> 00:02:54,702
saw a debut speech in parliament
from Fraser Anning

68
00:02:54,802 --> 00:02:56,302
that will live long in their memory.

69
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:59,102
"A crossbench senator has delivered

70
00:02:59,202 --> 00:03:01,102
a provocative first speech
to Parliament,

71
00:03:01,202 --> 00:03:04,002
calling for a ban on muslims
migrating to Australia."

72
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:07,502
Fraser Anning also used the term
"Final Solution",

73
00:03:07,602 --> 00:03:09,302
when talking about immigration,

74
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:12,702
a phrase used by Hitler
in Nazi Germany.

75
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:13,502
It's true.

76
00:03:13,602 --> 00:03:15,002
In a speech arguing in favor of

77
00:03:15,102 --> 00:03:17,402
a return to a "White Australia Policy",

78
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:19,502
Anning suggested having
a popular vote

79
00:03:19,602 --> 00:03:21,902
would be a good "Final Solution".

80
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,402
And that's just not a phrase
you want to throw around

81
00:03:24,502 --> 00:03:25,902
for pretty obvious reasons.

82
00:03:26,002 --> 00:03:28,902
It's the same reason that
we don't name babies Adolf anymore,

83
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:32,402
or have tiny mustaches,
or call yoga retreats

84
00:03:32,502 --> 00:03:33,802
"Concentration Camps."

85
00:03:33,902 --> 00:03:35,802
We could!
It would make sense.

86
00:03:35,902 --> 00:03:37,802
But people would be
understandably upset.

87
00:03:37,902 --> 00:03:40,302
But not only did Anning
refuse to apologize,

88
00:03:40,402 --> 00:03:42,102
the head of his party
backed him up.

89
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:44,702
Do you support
Fraser Anning's comments?

90
00:03:44,802 --> 00:03:48,602
Absolutely, one thousand percent.

91
00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:50,502
I support everything he said.

92
00:03:50,602 --> 00:03:52,202
It was a magnificent speech.

93
00:03:52,302 --> 00:03:54,202
It was solid gold.

94
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:57,902
And he stumbled on a bit of
a malapropism there,

95
00:03:58,002 --> 00:04:01,302
and hey, he didn't go to university.

96
00:04:01,402 --> 00:04:02,802
He didn't go to University

97
00:04:02,902 --> 00:04:05,302
to learn the significance
of all these words.

98
00:04:05,902 --> 00:04:09,002
First, the speech
was not "solid gold".

99
00:04:09,102 --> 00:04:10,502
And I really hope in Australia,

100
00:04:10,602 --> 00:04:12,102
you don't have to go to University

101
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:13,702
to have heard about the holocaust.

102
00:04:13,802 --> 00:04:16,802
Look, he bears no responsibility
for the words he uses.

103
00:04:16,902 --> 00:04:18,202
He doesn't know what they mean!

104
00:04:18,302 --> 00:04:20,402
If you gave 1,000 monkeys
1,000 typewriters,

105
00:04:20,502 --> 00:04:22,302
and one of them wrote "Heil Hitler",

106
00:04:22,402 --> 00:04:23,902
would you get all angry with him?

107
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:24,902
No! You'd be impressed!

108
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:27,002
That's a solid gold monkey
right there.

109
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:30,302
That man is Bob Katter,

110
00:04:30,402 --> 00:04:32,802
head of the self-named
"Katter's Australian Party",

111
00:04:32,902 --> 00:04:34,702
who has a temperament
to match his face.

112
00:04:34,802 --> 00:04:39,002
Just take a look at the hostile tone
of a previous campaign ad.

113
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:41,902
"One australian lawmaker
has come under fire

114
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:44,702
for the bad timing
of his new campaign video,

115
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:47,402
a mock execution
of his political opponents,

116
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:49,802
showing him blowing a smoking gun

117
00:04:49,902 --> 00:04:52,502
as lifeless bodies lie
in the background."

118
00:04:52,602 --> 00:04:53,502
Wow!

119
00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:55,902
I haven't seen
a commercial that extreme

120
00:04:56,002 --> 00:04:58,702
since the Geico Gecko
slit the Afflac Duck's throat.

121
00:04:58,802 --> 00:05:02,202
You went too far this time,
you little shit.

122
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,002
But underneath
his eccentric personality

123
00:05:05,102 --> 00:05:07,402
is the heart of a truly
unpleasant human being.

124
00:05:07,502 --> 00:05:08,802
Last year, Katter said,

125
00:05:08,902 --> 00:05:10,202
It is imperative the people from

126
00:05:10,302 --> 00:05:13,102
the Middle East and North Africa
are barred from entering Australia.

127
00:05:13,202 --> 00:05:15,602
And this week, when questioned
about Fraser Anning's comments,

128
00:05:15,702 --> 00:05:16,402
he said this.

129
00:05:16,502 --> 00:05:17,802
Are we racist?

130
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:19,002
Well, we're australians.

131
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:20,502
I don't know if that's racist or not,

132
00:05:20,602 --> 00:05:23,502
but we're not apologizing
for it to anyone.

133
00:05:23,902 --> 00:05:26,202
I can take this one.
You are and it is.

134
00:05:26,302 --> 00:05:26,902
And look.

135
00:05:27,002 --> 00:05:29,802
I'm not saying
all australians are racist.

136
00:05:29,902 --> 00:05:30,902
That would be racist.

137
00:05:31,002 --> 00:05:32,602
And I would never say
something like that,

138
00:05:32,702 --> 00:05:33,902
because I'm not australian.

139
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:36,202
But in fairness to Katter,

140
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,402
he's not just racist.

141
00:05:37,502 --> 00:05:38,902
He's also homophobic.

142
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:41,502
In 2011, he said gay marriage
should be ridiculed,

143
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:44,202
and when Australia approved
same-sex marriage just last year,

144
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,502
he tried to laugh it off,

145
00:05:45,602 --> 00:05:47,702
before doing a hard emotional turn.

146
00:05:47,802 --> 00:05:52,302
You know, people are entitled
to their sexual proclivities.

147
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:57,102
I mean, let there be
a thousand blossoms bloom

148
00:05:57,202 --> 00:05:58,402
as far as I'm concerned.

149
00:05:58,502 --> 00:06:01,002
But I ain't spending any time on it,

150
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:02,802
because in the meantime,

151
00:06:02,902 --> 00:06:04,102
every three months,

152
00:06:04,202 --> 00:06:07,002
a person is torn to pieces
by a crocodile

153
00:06:07,102 --> 00:06:08,102
in North Queensland.

154
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,102
Okay,

155
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,902
you cannot deflect
from a question of civil rights

156
00:06:12,002 --> 00:06:13,202
with a weird animal fact.

157
00:06:13,302 --> 00:06:16,102
People are entitled to be worried
about voter suppression,

158
00:06:16,202 --> 00:06:17,002
that's fine.

159
00:06:17,102 --> 00:06:18,802
But I ain't spending any time on it

160
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:21,602
when giraffes are walking around
with black tongues all day.

161
00:06:21,702 --> 00:06:23,202
It's a disgrace.

162
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:25,402
And look, I could spend all night

163
00:06:25,502 --> 00:06:26,902
showing you clips
of Katter being terrible.

164
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:28,702
But I just want to show you one more.

165
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:30,602
Because his objection
to same-sex marriage

166
00:06:30,702 --> 00:06:33,202
isn't just that it distracts
from croc-on-bloke crime.

167
00:06:33,302 --> 00:06:35,302
No, it's also because of this.

168
00:06:35,402 --> 00:06:38,402
The homosexual groupings in Australia,

169
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:40,302
they took the word "gay."

170
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:42,802
It was the most beautiful word
in the english language,

171
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,302
and they said, "oh good!
We'll take that word!

172
00:06:45,402 --> 00:06:46,702
And we'll have it as ours!"

173
00:06:46,802 --> 00:06:49,602
Oh, then there is this thing
called marriage,

174
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:52,302
the other mob, oh, well,
we'll take that, too!

175
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:54,802
You know? Well, what else
are they gonna take?

176
00:06:54,902 --> 00:06:56,402
Oh, I can tell you that.

177
00:06:56,502 --> 00:06:57,402
Nothing.

178
00:06:57,502 --> 00:07:00,102
Because they didn't take
the words "gay" or "marriage"

179
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:01,102
in the first place.

180
00:07:01,202 --> 00:07:03,802
Words can evolve over time
and be used in new contexts.

181
00:07:03,902 --> 00:07:06,202
There are very few exceptions
to that rule, Bob.

182
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:07,902
Can you think of one?

183
00:07:08,002 --> 00:07:09,502
Can you think of one, Bob?

184
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:11,402
I can, and if you think hard enough,

185
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,902
I'm sure you'll come up
with a final solution.

186
00:07:14,002 --> 00:07:16,202
And now this.

187
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,702
And now.

188
00:07:17,802 --> 00:07:20,402
The holiday local news teams dread.

189
00:07:20,802 --> 00:07:22,402
Today, ladies and gentlemen,

190
00:07:22,502 --> 00:07:23,602
if you didn't know it.

191
00:07:23,702 --> 00:07:26,002
It´s National Tell a Joke Day.

192
00:07:26,102 --> 00:07:27,602
Oh, yay, Greg.

193
00:07:27,702 --> 00:07:32,702
By the way,
tomorrow is National Joke Day.

194
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:33,602
Oh, no.

195
00:07:33,902 --> 00:07:36,302
What kind of jeans does Jaws wear?

196
00:07:36,602 --> 00:07:40,702
Denim, denim, denim, denim.
No?

197
00:07:40,802 --> 00:07:43,102
Why couldn't the toilet paper
across the street?

198
00:07:43,502 --> 00:07:44,702
He got stuck in a crack.

199
00:07:44,802 --> 00:07:47,502
Wow, really going for it.

200
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,902
Why does Snoop Dogg need an umbrella?

201
00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:54,102
Gosh, this is like a
slow-moving car crash.

202
00:07:54,202 --> 00:07:55,602
You see it coming from miles away.

203
00:07:55,702 --> 00:07:56,802
You know that Snoop Dogg,

204
00:07:56,902 --> 00:07:59,402
you know the reason why he has
his umbrella around, right guys?

205
00:07:59,502 --> 00:08:00,302
Because?

206
00:08:01,102 --> 00:08:04,202
You know, "Fo´ drizzle, man".

207
00:08:04,302 --> 00:08:05,202
Okay.

208
00:08:06,202 --> 00:08:08,502
Why did Snoop Dogg need an umbrella?

209
00:08:10,302 --> 00:08:11,802
Fo´ drizzle.

210
00:08:11,902 --> 00:08:14,602
- It´s National Tell a Joke Day.
- Is it?

211
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,902
It is.

212
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:20,702
Moving on.

213
00:08:20,802 --> 00:08:23,802
Our main story tonight concerns
"Trade".

214
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:25,602
The basic system of
barter and exchange

215
00:08:25,702 --> 00:08:28,702
that you have to do really carefully,
or you'll end up with Dwight Howard.

216
00:08:28,802 --> 00:08:31,802
Seriously, parents,
talk to your children about trade.

217
00:08:31,902 --> 00:08:34,102
You don't want them going to school
with pizza lunchables

218
00:08:34,202 --> 00:08:35,902
and coming home with Dwight Howard.

219
00:08:36,002 --> 00:08:38,702
You think he's going to add
a three point shot

220
00:08:38,802 --> 00:08:40,302
to his game now, kids?
Grow up.

221
00:08:40,602 --> 00:08:43,602
Trade is a subject on
which our current president

222
00:08:43,702 --> 00:08:45,602
considers himself particularly expert.

223
00:08:46,202 --> 00:08:46,902
Trade,

224
00:08:47,002 --> 00:08:49,302
that's what I'm gonna do so good.

225
00:08:49,402 --> 00:08:51,402
I'll take those trade deals
and make them so good,

226
00:08:51,502 --> 00:08:52,202
that's what I do.

227
00:08:52,302 --> 00:08:54,102
I love taking bad deals
and making them good.

228
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:54,702
I love trade.

229
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:56,202
You know trade's always been my thing.

230
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,902
I could name ten different
forms of trade.

231
00:08:58,002 --> 00:08:59,002
I know every one of them.

232
00:08:59,102 --> 00:09:00,902
Hey, the Wharton School of Finance
right here.

233
00:09:01,002 --> 00:09:02,802
Yeah, I can name
ten forms of trade:

234
00:09:02,902 --> 00:09:04,902
there's free trade, fair trade,
rough trade,

235
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:05,602
trader joe's.

236
00:09:05,702 --> 00:09:06,502
That's what, eight?

237
00:09:06,602 --> 00:09:09,302
Then there's human trafficking,
that's like trading for people.

238
00:09:09,402 --> 00:09:10,502
We'll round up and call it ten.

239
00:09:10,602 --> 00:09:12,302
Wharton School of Finance, right here!

240
00:09:13,002 --> 00:09:15,402
Trump has talked a big game
on trade for decades.

241
00:09:15,502 --> 00:09:17,502
And he's spent this year slapping tariffs

242
00:09:17,602 --> 00:09:19,802
on products from china,
Canada, the EU, and others,

243
00:09:19,902 --> 00:09:22,302
prompting them to retaliate
with tariffs of their own.

244
00:09:22,402 --> 00:09:24,602
And this trade war has escalated fast,

245
00:09:24,702 --> 00:09:27,702
from tariffs on just 18 products
at the start of the year

246
00:09:27,802 --> 00:09:29,502
to now over 10,000.

247
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,402
So things have gotten pretty serious.

248
00:09:31,502 --> 00:09:33,602
And american workers
are already being impacted,

249
00:09:33,702 --> 00:09:35,402
particularly in agriculture.

250
00:09:35,502 --> 00:09:39,702
"We're feeling a lot of pain right now
in the farm sector."

251
00:09:39,802 --> 00:09:42,402
"It's affecting farmers
in a negative way."

252
00:09:42,502 --> 00:09:44,902
"I always hope that one morning,

253
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,702
President Trump is just gonna wake up

254
00:09:46,802 --> 00:09:49,602
and send out that 3:30
in the morning tweet

255
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:51,702
that says "tariffs are gone."

256
00:09:52,102 --> 00:09:54,502
Wow, that is a depressing thought.

257
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:57,302
That guy's livelihood depends
on a tweet that says

258
00:09:57,402 --> 00:09:58,402
"Tariffs are gone."

259
00:09:58,502 --> 00:10:01,402
And even if Trump does end up
doing that at 3:30 in the morning,

260
00:10:01,502 --> 00:10:02,502
you just know it'll say

261
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,802
"Tarifs APE goon",

262
00:10:03,902 --> 00:10:06,802
and we'll all have to decide
what he meant by that.

263
00:10:06,902 --> 00:10:08,902
So tonight, before things get
much worse,

264
00:10:09,002 --> 00:10:10,602
let's take a look at this trade war.

265
00:10:10,702 --> 00:10:12,802
Because it's tempting to think
that Trump has a plan.

266
00:10:12,902 --> 00:10:14,902
After all, trade is his thing.

267
00:10:15,002 --> 00:10:18,202
And he's tweeted, "Trade wars
are good and easy to win."

268
00:10:18,302 --> 00:10:20,202
But for years, his strategy on that

269
00:10:20,302 --> 00:10:21,302
seems to have been based

270
00:10:21,402 --> 00:10:23,202
around little more than
tone of voice.

271
00:10:23,302 --> 00:10:24,902
So easy.

272
00:10:25,702 --> 00:10:29,602
I'd drop a 25% tax on China.

273
00:10:29,702 --> 00:10:34,902
And I said to somebody
that it's really the messenger.

274
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:36,402
The messenger is important.

275
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:41,902
I could have one man say,
"We're gonna tax you 25%."

276
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:43,702
And I could say another,

277
00:10:43,802 --> 00:10:48,102
"Listen you motherfuckers,
we're gonna tax you 25%."

278
00:10:49,502 --> 00:10:50,602
Oh, I see.

279
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:52,502
So the tone is important.

280
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:53,902
If I were to say to somebody,

281
00:10:54,002 --> 00:10:56,002
"That's not how trade negotiations work",

282
00:10:56,102 --> 00:10:57,002
that'd be one thing.

283
00:10:57,102 --> 00:10:58,102
If I were to say,

284
00:10:58,202 --> 00:11:00,902
"That's not how trade negotiations work,
you dumb motherfucker",

285
00:11:01,002 --> 00:11:02,502
that would be much more effective.

286
00:11:02,602 --> 00:11:04,202
That's good to know.

287
00:11:04,302 --> 00:11:06,402
Because for all Trump's confidence,

288
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:09,202
there are some very basic things
about economics

289
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,402
that he seems genuinely confused by.

290
00:11:11,502 --> 00:11:12,502
Take tariffs.

291
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:15,102
Trump once tweeted that
if the trade war doesn't end,

292
00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:18,102
other countries "will play us
vast sums of money

293
00:11:18,202 --> 00:11:19,302
in the form of tariffs."

294
00:11:19,402 --> 00:11:20,602
"We win either way."

295
00:11:20,702 --> 00:11:23,002
But that's not how tariffs work.

296
00:11:23,102 --> 00:11:26,602
Tariffs are taxes designed
to make foreign goods more expensive.

297
00:11:26,702 --> 00:11:29,002
Therefore making domestic products
more appealing.

298
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:31,402
Other countries don't pay us tariffs,

299
00:11:31,502 --> 00:11:34,302
importers do when they
receive the goods,

300
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,902
and they usually pass that cost
along to the consumer.

301
00:11:37,002 --> 00:11:39,002
So, when Trump imposes
a tariff on an item,

302
00:11:39,102 --> 00:11:41,202
you are probably going to pay
more for it.

303
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:43,202
As reporters have been
trying to explain,

304
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,802
in the most literal way possible.

305
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:46,402
"Here in the kitchen,

306
00:11:46,502 --> 00:11:48,502
made in China utensils and appliances,

307
00:11:48,602 --> 00:11:50,802
like stoves and refrigerators
are being targeted.

308
00:11:50,902 --> 00:11:52,002
Upstairs in the bathroom,

309
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:53,502
everyday items like shampoo,

310
00:11:53,602 --> 00:11:55,802
nail clippers, makeup and towels."

311
00:11:55,902 --> 00:11:58,502
It could mean higher prices
for things like instant coffee

312
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:00,802
and this Harley Davidson motorcycle.

313
00:12:00,902 --> 00:12:03,902
Everyday items, like the iPad,
could be hit.

314
00:12:04,002 --> 00:12:05,502
The tablet has a chip from Intel,

315
00:12:05,602 --> 00:12:06,802
which could be a target.

316
00:12:06,902 --> 00:12:09,402
E-scooters have taken off this year.

317
00:12:09,502 --> 00:12:12,502
Now they face a 25% tariff.

318
00:12:12,902 --> 00:12:15,002
Okay, I hate to admit this.

319
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:17,802
If one of the key casualties
of this trade war is e-scooters,

320
00:12:17,902 --> 00:12:19,502
I actually think I'm fine with that.

321
00:12:19,602 --> 00:12:24,402
They are basically if Dane Cook
somehow became transportation.

322
00:12:24,502 --> 00:12:28,502
And it's not just tariffs
that Trump seems to misunderstand.

323
00:12:28,602 --> 00:12:30,102
There's also our trade deficit.

324
00:12:30,202 --> 00:12:31,802
Basically, the number that expresses

325
00:12:31,902 --> 00:12:33,902
how much more we buy
from other countries,

326
00:12:34,002 --> 00:12:35,502
than they buy from us.

327
00:12:35,602 --> 00:12:37,602
Trump talks about it all the time,

328
00:12:37,702 --> 00:12:38,702
usually like this.

329
00:12:39,202 --> 00:12:46,102
Our trade deficit ballooned
to $817 billion dollars.

330
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:48,102
Think of that.

331
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:54,402
We lost $817 billion dollars a year

332
00:12:54,502 --> 00:12:57,202
over the last number of years.

333
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,702
In trade.

334
00:12:59,802 --> 00:13:02,202
In other words, if we didn't trade,

335
00:13:02,702 --> 00:13:05,102
we'd save a hell of a lot of money.

336
00:13:05,502 --> 00:13:07,602
Okay, there's a lot to unpack there.

337
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:11,402
First, our trade deficit
is actually $552 billion.

338
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:14,002
So he was off
by a quarter-trillion dollars,

339
00:13:14,102 --> 00:13:16,102
Wharton School of Finance, right there!

340
00:13:16,702 --> 00:13:19,602
Second, trade deficits aren't
actually always bad.

341
00:13:19,702 --> 00:13:21,902
And many economists believe,
for very complex reasons

342
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:24,202
involving savings rates
and the dollar's special status

343
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:25,502
as the world's reserve currency,

344
00:13:25,602 --> 00:13:26,402
America's trade balance

345
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:28,702
might be more or less
where it should be.

346
00:13:28,802 --> 00:13:31,802
And finally, and this is important,
when we have a trade deficit,

347
00:13:31,902 --> 00:13:33,302
we don't "lose money."

348
00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:36,102
It's not a big pile of cash
that we handed over.

349
00:13:36,202 --> 00:13:38,302
We bought things, that we received.

350
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:40,002
And I'm not saying it was all valuable

351
00:13:40,102 --> 00:13:43,002
does anyone really need
the "Pony Up Daddy Saddle",

352
00:13:43,102 --> 00:13:46,302
which allows your child to symbolize
their new-found dominance

353
00:13:46,402 --> 00:13:47,102
over your life?

354
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:49,202
No, I didn't need it,
but I "wanted" it,

355
00:13:49,302 --> 00:13:51,702
and honestly, it's brought my dad
and me closer together.

356
00:13:52,902 --> 00:13:56,302
And even the world leaders
that Trump has been fighting with

357
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,002
seemed alarmed by how little
he understands trade.

358
00:13:59,102 --> 00:14:02,002
The EU Chief, Jean-Claude Juncker,
reportedly met Trump

359
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:03,702
armed with a series of colorful,

360
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,302
simple flash cards
to explain the trade war.

361
00:14:06,402 --> 00:14:08,902
And the word that really gets me there
is "colorful."

362
00:14:09,002 --> 00:14:13,602
Because that means they had
some simple flash cards and thought

363
00:14:13,702 --> 00:14:15,002
"No, too wonky.

364
00:14:15,102 --> 00:14:17,702
Let's get some big fun baby colors
on those things."

365
00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:19,102
"Lets give him a chance."

366
00:14:19,202 --> 00:14:22,702
And Angela Merkel struggled to explain
something even more basic.

367
00:14:23,202 --> 00:14:26,702
"The independent newspaper citing
an unnamed senior german official,

368
00:14:26,802 --> 00:14:28,802
ten times Trump asked Ms. Merkel

369
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,902
if he could negotiate a trade deal
with Germany.

370
00:14:31,002 --> 00:14:32,202
Every time she replied,

371
00:14:32,302 --> 00:14:34,102
"You can't do a trade deal
with Germany.

372
00:14:34,202 --> 00:14:35,202
Only the EU."

373
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:38,302
On the eleventh refusal,
Trump finally got the message.

374
00:14:38,402 --> 00:14:40,202
"Oh, we'll do a deal with Europe then."

375
00:14:40,702 --> 00:14:42,002
He understood,

376
00:14:42,102 --> 00:14:44,402
but only after the eleventh refusal!

377
00:14:44,502 --> 00:14:46,002
Just listen to what that sounds like.

378
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:48,802
- Deal with Europe.
- Huh?

379
00:14:48,902 --> 00:14:51,402
- Deal with Europe.
- Huh?

380
00:14:51,502 --> 00:14:53,502
- Deal with Europe.
- Huh?

381
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:56,102
- Deal with Europe.
- Huh?

382
00:14:56,202 --> 00:14:59,602
- Deal with Europe.
- Huh?

383
00:14:59,702 --> 00:15:02,002
- Deal with Europe.
- Okay, I'll deal with Europe.

384
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:04,502
Honestly, I'm just amazed
that after the fifth time,

385
00:15:04,602 --> 00:15:06,602
Angela Merkel didn't turn
to her translator and say

386
00:15:06,702 --> 00:15:07,902
"Okay, you're fucking fired.

387
00:15:08,002 --> 00:15:10,402
You can't possibly be
translating this right."

388
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:14,102
And I'm not saying it's easy
to understand trade.

389
00:15:14,202 --> 00:15:16,102
It is one of the most complicated
issues there is,

390
00:15:16,202 --> 00:15:18,302
technically, politically,
and emotionally.

391
00:15:18,402 --> 00:15:21,502
Over the years, free trade
has been criticized from all sides.

392
00:15:21,602 --> 00:15:23,502
People argue that unfettered trade

393
00:15:23,602 --> 00:15:26,802
can reward the worst behavior
of multinational companies,

394
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:29,702
and exploit countries with fewer
protections for labor,

395
00:15:29,802 --> 00:15:32,102
and that has unquestionably happened.

396
00:15:32,202 --> 00:15:35,302
But Trump generally confines
himself to arguing

397
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:38,202
that trade is responsible
for the death of US manufacturing jobs.

398
00:15:38,302 --> 00:15:39,802
And while there is some truth in that,

399
00:15:39,902 --> 00:15:42,702
automation is the far bigger culprit.

400
00:15:42,802 --> 00:15:44,902
We actually still make
a lot of things in America.

401
00:15:45,002 --> 00:15:49,302
US Factories now manufacture
twice as much as they did in 1984.

402
00:15:49,402 --> 00:15:52,602
But they do it with one-third
fewer workers.

403
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,102
And the overwhelming consensus
among economists

404
00:15:55,202 --> 00:15:57,502
is that trade between countries,
generally speaking,

405
00:15:57,602 --> 00:15:59,902
can create jobs, lower costs,

406
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:01,802
and be a net benefit to both nations.

407
00:16:01,902 --> 00:16:03,702
Essentially, think of trade like sex.

408
00:16:03,802 --> 00:16:06,502
If you're doing it right,
it can be good for both partners,

409
00:16:06,602 --> 00:16:08,402
though the odds
of that happening plummet

410
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:10,302
as soon as Donald Trump
gets involved.

411
00:16:11,202 --> 00:16:16,102
And the problem with Trump,
the real problem, not understanding trade

412
00:16:16,202 --> 00:16:18,502
is that he therefore doesn't
understand its consequences.

413
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:21,802
For instance, one of the first
major shots he fired in this trade war

414
00:16:21,902 --> 00:16:24,102
was putting tariffs on steel
and aluminum.

415
00:16:24,202 --> 00:16:26,902
That was great news
for the people working

416
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:28,502
in those specific industries,

417
00:16:28,602 --> 00:16:31,102
like this worker
in a Missouri aluminum plant.

418
00:16:31,202 --> 00:16:33,702
You think that his policies

419
00:16:33,802 --> 00:16:35,202
are kinda why you have a job today?

420
00:16:35,302 --> 00:16:36,102
I know it is.

421
00:16:36,202 --> 00:16:37,502
You know it is?

422
00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:41,002
Yeah, I wouldn't have had this job
if it didn't happen.

423
00:16:41,102 --> 00:16:42,502
Wish I could meet him.

424
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,602
I'd give him a big old hug.

425
00:16:44,902 --> 00:16:46,099
You know?

426
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:47,699
Yeah, I do know.

427
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,799
And I honestly get
why he wants to hug him.

428
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:51,299
Trump got him his job back.

429
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:53,099
It's one of two possible explanations

430
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,199
for that man wanting to hug
Donald Trump.

431
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:56,699
The other, of course, being,

432
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,899
that if, during the early stages
of the campaign,

433
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:01,499
Trump and Melania were driving
through Missouri on a stormy night,

434
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:03,499
and their car broke down.
Donald's not getting out,

435
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:06,099
so Melania ends up climbing out
into the rain and opening the hood

436
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:08,399
as that aluminum worker
comes driving down the highway.

437
00:17:08,499 --> 00:17:10,299
He rolls down his window
and asks if he can help,

438
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,699
to which Melania gratefully asks,

439
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:12,799
"maybe a flashlight?"

440
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:15,399
And just as the aluminum worker
is handing the flashlight over,

441
00:17:15,499 --> 00:17:17,699
it gets struck by lightning
and they switch bodies.

442
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:20,799
So, now, Donald is living
in the White House

443
00:17:20,899 --> 00:17:23,399
with an aluminum worker
who feels understandably weird

444
00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:26,299
about holding his hand,
while Melania is forced to pine

445
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:27,999
after her husband
from the factory floor,

446
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,699
her heart aching for him
every second of every day,

447
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,899
knowing full well that revealing
her true identity

448
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:34,299
would just complicate things
for everyone.

449
00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:35,699
But that's bullshit, Melania!

450
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:36,899
You go to him!

451
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:38,599
The world will accept your love!

452
00:17:38,699 --> 00:17:41,099
That aluminum worker clearly
isn't in love with him!

453
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:42,399
Everyone can see it!

454
00:17:42,499 --> 00:17:44,399
It explains so much!

455
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:50,899
The point is, for that individual guy,

456
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:52,499
in that individual job,

457
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:53,699
things have improved.

458
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:55,299
But when it comes to trade,

459
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:57,299
nothing happens in isolation.

460
00:17:57,399 --> 00:18:00,299
And there are downstream effects
to those tariffs.

461
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:02,099
Not too far from where
that guy works,

462
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:04,199
there's a nail factory which suffered.

463
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:06,099
Because, thanks to Trump's
steel tariffs,

464
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:09,499
the price of their raw material,
steel, skyrocketed.

465
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:11,199
Sales dropped in half,

466
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,099
and they've laid off
over 100 workers,

467
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:14,999
and those that remain are worried.

468
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:18,299
Some of these people,
this is the only income they got.

469
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:19,699
Just like me.

470
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,199
This is the only income I got.

471
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:23,299
And I gotta put another daughter
through school.

472
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:24,999
You know, it's gonna be hard.

473
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:26,499
Yeah, it is.

474
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:27,999
That's the problem here.

475
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:29,899
Protecting steel helps steel,

476
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:32,099
but it hurts anything made from it.

477
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:34,299
And you have to balance
those consequences.

478
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:35,999
By one estimate, Trump's tariffs

479
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:39,799
may create 26,000 jobs
in steel and aluminum,

480
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:44,399
but could cost over 400,000 jobs
across the rest of the economy.

481
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,017
So if Trump's trying to create jobs,

482
00:18:46,117 --> 00:18:49,517
almost anything would be
a better idea than tariffs.

483
00:18:49,617 --> 00:18:52,517
He'd be better off
dressing a turtle up like David Bowie

484
00:18:52,617 --> 00:18:54,795
and throwing him
into a pool full of milk.

485
00:18:54,895 --> 00:18:56,095
Will that create jobs?

486
00:18:56,195 --> 00:18:57,095
Of course not.

487
00:18:57,195 --> 00:18:59,695
But it won't actively lose hundreds
of thousands of them,

488
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:02,995
plus it would be the highlight
of Ziggy Shelldust's life.

489
00:19:03,695 --> 00:19:09,495
And we're only scratching the surface
of how complicated this is.

490
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:12,695
because distinguishing between
a foreign product and an american job

491
00:19:12,795 --> 00:19:14,995
can be a lot trickier
than you'd think.

492
00:19:15,095 --> 00:19:18,595
Take some of trump's favorite villains
when it comes to foreign companies.

493
00:19:19,295 --> 00:19:23,995
They sell Mercedes and BMW
and the cars come in by the millions.

494
00:19:24,095 --> 00:19:26,295
And we hardly tax them at all.

495
00:19:26,395 --> 00:19:27,695
We can't do this stuff anymore.

496
00:19:27,795 --> 00:19:29,095
We protect Germany.

497
00:19:29,195 --> 00:19:31,195
Germany,
who doesn't have a BMW?

498
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:35,895
We're gonna tax Mercedes-Benz,
we're gonna tax BMW.

499
00:19:35,995 --> 00:19:39,695
We're gonna tax all of those beautiful
Mercedes-Benz that are coming in

500
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:42,595
and we're gonna tax BMWs
that are coming in.

501
00:19:42,995 --> 00:19:45,795
Trump is furious with german cars.

502
00:19:45,895 --> 00:19:47,495
Here's the thing about that.

503
00:19:47,595 --> 00:19:50,495
In the clip where he said,
"who doesn't have a BMW?"

504
00:19:50,595 --> 00:19:52,895
to the crowd, in his classic
man-of-the-people way,

505
00:19:53,295 --> 00:19:56,495
Trump is in North Augusta,
South Carolina.

506
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,995
And just two hours drive-away
there is a place called

507
00:19:59,095 --> 00:20:00,295
Spartanburg County,

508
00:20:00,395 --> 00:20:01,595
well-known for this.

509
00:20:02,395 --> 00:20:06,395
"Spartanburg is home to the largest
BMW plant in the world."

510
00:20:06,495 --> 00:20:08,895
"Last year they made more than
three hundred seventy thousand

511
00:20:08,995 --> 00:20:11,595
luxury SUV's,
employing ten thousand people,

512
00:20:11,695 --> 00:20:14,295
pumping billions
into the state's economy.

513
00:20:14,595 --> 00:20:15,295
Yes.

514
00:20:15,395 --> 00:20:16,895
It seems Trump didn't know that.

515
00:20:16,995 --> 00:20:17,495
And look.

516
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:20,095
Everyone knows he doesn't know
a lot of things.

517
00:20:20,195 --> 00:20:22,095
But occasionally it's important
to remember

518
00:20:22,195 --> 00:20:23,895
that he also doesn't know anything.

519
00:20:23,995 --> 00:20:24,695
It's true.

520
00:20:24,795 --> 00:20:26,795
It´s true.
I´ll show you.

521
00:20:26,895 --> 00:20:30,095
Everyone close your eyes right now
and think of something.

522
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:31,895
That thing you're thinking of?

523
00:20:31,995 --> 00:20:33,295
He doesn't know that.

524
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:35,795
And since the trade war began,

525
00:20:35,895 --> 00:20:38,095
Spartanburg County is actually
double-fucked.

526
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,995
Because they'll be affected
by higher costs

527
00:20:40,095 --> 00:20:42,195
for the steel that they use
to build the cars,

528
00:20:42,295 --> 00:20:44,195
and when they try
to ship them to China,

529
00:20:44,295 --> 00:20:45,895
they'll be hit by chinese tariffs.

530
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,395
So they're in complicated trouble.

531
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:48,595
Or as Trump might put it,

532
00:20:48,695 --> 00:20:51,095
"Listen you motherfuckers,
you're getting taxed twice."

533
00:20:51,195 --> 00:20:54,795
So, if a trade war
could be this disruptive,

534
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:57,395
and the net benefits
are likely to be negative,

535
00:20:57,495 --> 00:20:59,295
why is Trump doing this?

536
00:20:59,395 --> 00:21:02,295
Especially because members
of his own economic team

537
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:03,395
seem against it?

538
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:06,695
Gary Cohn reportedly left over
the proposed tariffs,

539
00:21:06,795 --> 00:21:10,095
and Steve Mnuchin, Treasury Secretary
and white-hot sex bomb,

540
00:21:10,195 --> 00:21:12,895
has tried to do some damage control

541
00:21:12,995 --> 00:21:15,395
by claiming we're not actually
in a trade war at all.

542
00:21:15,995 --> 00:21:18,195
This has been a trade
dispute all along.

543
00:21:18,295 --> 00:21:19,795
It never was a trade war.

544
00:21:19,895 --> 00:21:21,195
It's a trade dispute.

545
00:21:21,795 --> 00:21:23,095
Oh, I get it!

546
00:21:23,195 --> 00:21:24,795
It's not a war,
it's a dispute!

547
00:21:24,895 --> 00:21:26,795
You know, I almost bought
that bullshit,

548
00:21:26,895 --> 00:21:30,395
because I was so distracted
by this lava-rich sex volcano's looks.

549
00:21:30,495 --> 00:21:31,895
The guy is hypnotic.

550
00:21:31,995 --> 00:21:34,095
I must have a bad case
of the mnuchies right now,

551
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:36,295
because he is looking
like an absolute "snack."

552
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:42,795
So who is telling the President
that this is a good idea?

553
00:21:42,895 --> 00:21:46,595
Well, by most accounts,
the driving force is Peter Navarro.

554
00:21:46,695 --> 00:21:49,095
Head of the Office of Trade
and Manufacturing Policy.

555
00:21:49,195 --> 00:21:50,795
He's Trump's trade guy.

556
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:51,795
Isn't that right, Peter?

557
00:21:52,195 --> 00:21:53,395
I'm the trade guy.

558
00:21:53,795 --> 00:21:54,595
Thanks, Pete.

559
00:21:54,695 --> 00:21:56,695
So, for the record,

560
00:21:56,795 --> 00:21:59,195
let's all get our Trump
administration roles straight.

561
00:21:59,295 --> 00:22:00,295
We've got trade guy,

562
00:22:00,395 --> 00:22:02,095
liar lady, nothing boy,

563
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,195
Jesus pleaser, word ghoul,

564
00:22:04,295 --> 00:22:06,295
crime nymph, drunk grandpa,

565
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:07,295
and daughter wife.

566
00:22:07,395 --> 00:22:09,595
It's a well-oiled machine
he´s running.

567
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:13,495
Now, Navarro is the author of a series
of get-rich investment books,

568
00:22:13,595 --> 00:22:14,295
and like Trump,

569
00:22:14,395 --> 00:22:16,595
he's obsessed with trade
deficits in general,

570
00:22:16,695 --> 00:22:17,895
and China in particular,

571
00:22:17,995 --> 00:22:20,695
saying trade with China
is a "zero sum game",

572
00:22:20,795 --> 00:22:24,295
meaning one country can only win
if the other country loses.

573
00:22:24,395 --> 00:22:28,695
And it is hard to overstate just
how rare his views are

574
00:22:28,795 --> 00:22:29,595
among economists.

575
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:31,295
When the New Yorker profiled him,

576
00:22:31,395 --> 00:22:34,395
they asked Navarro to help them find
even one colleague

577
00:22:34,495 --> 00:22:35,495
who agreed with him.

578
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:36,695
He gave them two names.

579
00:22:36,795 --> 00:22:37,995
One was Peter Morici,

580
00:22:38,095 --> 00:22:40,395
a University of Maryland professor
who said of Navarro,

581
00:22:40,495 --> 00:22:42,295
"He has a rather severe position.

582
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:45,495
That zero-sum statement,
I have a problem with that.

583
00:22:45,595 --> 00:22:47,295
Where's his proof?"

584
00:22:47,895 --> 00:22:50,595
And the other was a blogger
named Alan Tonelson,

585
00:22:50,695 --> 00:22:53,195
who Navarro described
as "a fine economist",

586
00:22:53,295 --> 00:22:54,495
to which Tonelson replied,

587
00:22:54,595 --> 00:22:56,895
"I do not hold an economics degree."

588
00:22:57,895 --> 00:23:00,895
I'm guessing he also doesn't hold
a degree in web design,

589
00:23:00,995 --> 00:23:04,795
because this is the photo
on the "About" page of his blog.

590
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:08,195
So if you're understandably
wondering at this point,

591
00:23:08,295 --> 00:23:13,695
"Then how on Earth did Navarro
get a job at the fucking White House?"

592
00:23:14,095 --> 00:23:16,595
Well, it is way dumber
than you are thinking.

593
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,795
Apparently, Jared Kushner
was tasked with finding Trump

594
00:23:19,895 --> 00:23:21,095
experts on chinese trade,

595
00:23:21,195 --> 00:23:23,495
and this is how he went about it.

596
00:23:23,595 --> 00:23:25,095
So Jared went on Amazon.

597
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,295
He fired up his computer

598
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:28,195
and he found some
of Peter Navarro's books

599
00:23:28,295 --> 00:23:29,995
and he asked him to come
to the White House.

600
00:23:30,095 --> 00:23:32,395
That's how Peter Navarro
ended up in the White House.

601
00:23:33,595 --> 00:23:37,295
Yeap, Jared looked
for experts on amazon.

602
00:23:37,395 --> 00:23:39,795
That was his rigorous process.

603
00:23:39,895 --> 00:23:42,195
So when Jeff Sessions
does get fired,

604
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,995
be prepared for him to be replaced
by Crystal Kaswell,

605
00:23:45,095 --> 00:23:46,695
author of the erotic fiction novel,

606
00:23:46,795 --> 00:23:49,195
"Dangerous Rock:
A Dangerous Noise Novel."

607
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:50,595
Because, for whatever reason,

608
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,195
that is honestly the first thing
that came up when we typed

609
00:23:53,295 --> 00:23:56,295
"Good law person (smart)"
into Amazon.

610
00:23:56,395 --> 00:24:03,095
The Navarro Book that Jared found
was called "Death by China",

611
00:24:03,195 --> 00:24:05,695
and it paints the US
chinese trade relationship

612
00:24:05,795 --> 00:24:07,495
in apocalyptic terms.

613
00:24:07,595 --> 00:24:09,695
Because while there are some
legitimate complaints

614
00:24:09,795 --> 00:24:11,195
about China's unfair practices,

615
00:24:11,295 --> 00:24:13,195
they've deliberately depressed
their currency,

616
00:24:13,295 --> 00:24:15,095
they violate intellectual property rights,

617
00:24:15,195 --> 00:24:17,095
and arguably skirt WTO rules,

618
00:24:17,195 --> 00:24:19,695
this book goes way further,

619
00:24:19,795 --> 00:24:21,995
with chapter titles
featuring phrases like

620
00:24:22,095 --> 00:24:23,795
"Shanghaiing the Gene Pool."

621
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:27,295
And "Look Ma, There's a Death Star
Pointing at Chicago."

622
00:24:27,395 --> 00:24:30,695
Navarro actually turned the book
into a movie that one critic called

623
00:24:30,795 --> 00:24:33,995
"the documentary equivalent
of a raving street-corner derelict."

624
00:24:34,095 --> 00:24:37,995
Which seems harsh,
until you see how the movie begins.

625
00:24:38,095 --> 00:24:40,295
"The film you are about to see

626
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:43,895
addresses one of the most urgent
problems facing America:

627
00:24:45,495 --> 00:24:48,395
It´s increasingly destructive
trade relationship

628
00:24:48,495 --> 00:24:50,695
with a rapidly rising China."

629
00:24:51,195 --> 00:24:52,895
It starts like that.

630
00:24:53,295 --> 00:24:55,895
Its warmup is a literal knife
being stabbed

631
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,395
into the heart of America.

632
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:59,895
And if you're worried
that leaves it with nowhere to go,

633
00:24:59,995 --> 00:25:01,495
please don't be concerned.

634
00:25:01,595 --> 00:25:04,095
Because there are even less-subtle
animations to come,

635
00:25:04,195 --> 00:25:07,195
which depict China's trade practices
as guns and bombs

636
00:25:07,295 --> 00:25:09,095
that blow up american factories,

637
00:25:09,195 --> 00:25:11,395
and stunningly deceptive moments,
like this.

638
00:25:11,995 --> 00:25:14,795
China has stolen thousands
of our factories

639
00:25:14,895 --> 00:25:16,995
and millions of our jobs.

640
00:25:17,095 --> 00:25:19,995
Multinational corporation profits
are soaring

641
00:25:20,095 --> 00:25:23,095
and we now owe
over three trillion dollars

642
00:25:23,195 --> 00:25:25,895
to the world's largest
communist nation.

643
00:25:26,495 --> 00:25:27,195
And look.

644
00:25:27,295 --> 00:25:29,995
I´m not saying that large ball
isn´t very convincing,

645
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:33,095
but our trade deficit
isn't the same as

646
00:25:33,195 --> 00:25:34,295
"what we owe to China",

647
00:25:34,395 --> 00:25:35,895
those are two different numbers.

648
00:25:35,995 --> 00:25:39,195
And neither of them
is anywhere close to 3 trillion.

649
00:25:39,295 --> 00:25:41,195
And when something
that central to your movie

650
00:25:41,295 --> 00:25:42,995
has something that wrong with it,

651
00:25:43,095 --> 00:25:45,795
you usually have to replace it
with Christopher Plummer.

652
00:25:45,895 --> 00:25:51,895
So Navarro is not someone
who any legitimate economist

653
00:25:51,995 --> 00:25:52,895
takes seriously.

654
00:25:52,995 --> 00:25:55,995
And yet, he seems to be the only person
the President is listening to.

655
00:25:56,095 --> 00:25:58,695
Trump has called "Death by China":
"Right on."

656
00:25:58,795 --> 00:26:01,495
And lauded it's facts,
figures, and insight.

657
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:03,495
And Navarro returns the compliment

658
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:06,295
saying of his own job,
that "My function, really,

659
00:26:06,395 --> 00:26:09,395
as an economist is to try and provide
the underlying analytics

660
00:26:09,495 --> 00:26:11,095
that confirm Trump's intuition."

661
00:26:11,595 --> 00:26:14,095
"And his intuition is always right."

662
00:26:14,195 --> 00:26:16,295
And that is simply terrifying.

663
00:26:16,395 --> 00:26:18,795
Because an economist
shouldn't be finding ways

664
00:26:18,895 --> 00:26:20,495
to confirm the intuitions of someone

665
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:22,495
who doesn't know
what they're talking about.

666
00:26:22,595 --> 00:26:24,895
It's like a builder working
for a child, saying,

667
00:26:24,995 --> 00:26:27,295
"My job is to build this house
he designed,

668
00:26:27,395 --> 00:26:29,095
which is shaped like an ice-cream cone,

669
00:26:29,195 --> 00:26:30,695
with a window that is also a door,

670
00:26:30,795 --> 00:26:32,795
and the size of the sun,
and a dog.

671
00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:34,895
His intuitions are always right."

672
00:26:34,995 --> 00:26:35,995
No they aren´t!

673
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:40,033
You need to stop that child
before someone gets hurt.

674
00:26:40,133 --> 00:26:42,233
In fact, if you want to get a sense

675
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:45,333
of just how little Navarro understands
the game he's playing,

676
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:46,133
consider this.

677
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:50,833
Since the trade war began,
China has imposed $37 billion of tariffs

678
00:26:50,933 --> 00:26:51,633
on the US.

679
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:55,033
Now, take a look at what Navarro
said back in March.

680
00:26:55,433 --> 00:26:58,133
Are you expecting china to come back
with retaliation?

681
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:01,733
I don't believe any country
in the world is going to retaliate

682
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:04,233
for the simple reason
that we are the most lucrative

683
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,733
and biggest market in the world.

684
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,233
They know they're cheating us

685
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:09,733
and all we're doing is
standing up for ourselves.

686
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:13,933
It's just breathtaking to see someone
be that confident and that wrong.

687
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:17,233
He´s basically Leonardo DiCaprio
in "Titanic", yelling

688
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:18,433
"I'm king of the world."

689
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:19,833
Except you're not,
are you Leo?

690
00:27:19,933 --> 00:27:21,433
You're just an amateur sketch artist

691
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:23,033
who's about to be murdered by ice.

692
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:27,233
When you put all of this together,
what you're left with is this:

693
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:29,133
We're engaged in
an escalating trade war

694
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:31,533
that almost no legitimate
economist supports,

695
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:34,033
led by a man who honestly
doesn't seem to fully understand

696
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:36,133
the mechanics of what he's doing,
getting advice

697
00:27:36,233 --> 00:27:39,033
from the human equivalent of an
all-caps email from your uncle.

698
00:27:39,133 --> 00:27:40,733
And the crazy thing is,

699
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:44,633
the effect of all this is the exact
opposite of what Trump says he wants.

700
00:27:44,733 --> 00:27:46,233
Because if you want to create jobs,

701
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,733
you don't do that by cutting off

702
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,633
american companies' markets
and suppliers.

703
00:27:49,733 --> 00:27:52,233
And if you want to curb
the abuses of countries, like China,

704
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:53,933
you don't do that by pissing off

705
00:27:54,033 --> 00:27:55,933
the leaders of every other
nation on Earth.

706
00:27:56,033 --> 00:27:59,333
And I know none of what I'm saying,
right now, will get through to Trump.

707
00:27:59,433 --> 00:28:02,733
So maybe it's time to take a page
from one the only people

708
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:06,133
he actually listening to, and give him
some basic economic lessons

709
00:28:06,233 --> 00:28:08,133
in the only language
he seems to understand.

710
00:28:09,133 --> 00:28:10,633
"The film you are about to see

711
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:13,633
addresses one of the most
urgent problems facing America:

712
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:16,633
The Destruction of Basic
Economic Knowledge by

713
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:18,133
Stupidity.

714
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:20,833
And the consequences of it
could be disastrous.

715
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:23,733
So let's review a few
fundamental facts.

716
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:26,633
First, a trade deficit isn't
a giant pool of money

717
00:28:26,733 --> 00:28:28,433
that you have lost it to another country.

718
00:28:28,533 --> 00:28:29,733
That's idiotic.

719
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,433
Second, if you think you can use
tariffs as a weapon,

720
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:35,033
you should understand a tariff
isn't something

721
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:36,533
other countries pay you.

722
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:39,433
It´s a tax you are forcing
your own people to pay,

723
00:28:39,533 --> 00:28:43,033
which might end up hurting them
a lot less than it hurts you.

724
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:46,933
And third, our economy
is massively interconnected,

725
00:28:47,033 --> 00:28:50,133
and you can't just tamper with one thing
without considering

726
00:28:50,233 --> 00:28:53,033
what the wider consequences could be.

727
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:57,133
Unfortunately, misunderstandings
just keep getting bigger

728
00:28:57,233 --> 00:28:59,133
while basic knowledge is shrinking.

729
00:28:59,233 --> 00:29:04,033
And the result is stupidity is increasing
at an unsustainable rate.

730
00:29:04,133 --> 00:29:05,033
Listen.

731
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:07,133
Economics is incredibly complicated,

732
00:29:07,233 --> 00:29:11,533
and at the very least, you probably
shouldn´t find your key economic advisor

733
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:13,333
on fucking Amazon.

734
00:29:13,433 --> 00:29:19,033
Because his a bullshit could end up
seriously hurting us all.

735
00:29:22,233 --> 00:29:24,233
That´s our show.
Thank you so much for watching.

736
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:26,033
We are all for the next couple
of weeks.

737
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:28,033
Back September 9th.
See you then. Good Night!
