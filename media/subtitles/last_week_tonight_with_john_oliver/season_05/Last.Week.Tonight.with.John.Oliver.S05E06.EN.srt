LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,080
SEASON V
EPISODE 6

3
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,520
Welcome to "Last Week Tonight" !
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,560
Thak you so much for joining us !
Time for a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,240
It was a slow one
for The Trump White House

6
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,000
in the did only saw the fallout
of a porn star 60 minutes interview,

7
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,560
a speech featuring a seemingly ad-lib
reversal our military strategy in Syria

8
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,480
and the firing
of VA secretary David Shulkin.

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,320
But don't worry,
Trump had a replacement lined up

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,240
and he searched everywhere
within 12 feet of him

11
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,000
to appoint his own White House doctor
who you may recall

12
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,080
from his ringing endorsement
of Trump's health.

13
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,560
The president's health in excellent.
He has incredible genes.

14
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,480
I told the president
he might live to be 200 years old.

15
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,520
He remain fit for duty
for the remainder of this term

16
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,560
and for the remainder of another term
if he's elected.

17
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,200
Hold on there, doc, because first
Trump's health is not excellent.

18
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,720
Not the diagnoses
any google image search could make.

19
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,640
And secondly he absolutely
does not have incredible genes.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,440
We've had irrefutable evidence
of that for the past 40 years.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,200
But let's not all get sucked into
Trump's gravitational force yet again.

22
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,200
Instead let's talk about Egypt. Home
of the world's first botched nose job.

23
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,720
Egypt had a presidential election.
The results will be official tomorrow.

24
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,960
We can reveal the winner was...
Hillary Clinton !

25
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm kidding !

26
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,960
I'm kidding ! She didn't win.

27
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,840
I just love messing with you.
The emails were really a problem.

28
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,360
The winner of course will be Egypt
strongman Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.

29
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,640
A man who one unrolled
a red carpet for himself,

30
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,160
that was literally
more that 2 miles long.

31
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,920
I know that he's the winner
because he had no serious opponents.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
One was arrested and three more
withdrew amid reports of intimidation,

33
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,880
and yet el-Sisi claimed to be devastated
by the lack of competition.

34
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,760
It's not my fault ! I swear to God,
I wish that would have been

35
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,920
more candidates
for people to choose who they want.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,680
But they were not ready yet.
There is no shame.

37
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,360
So, el-Sisi saying I wish
there had been more candidates

38
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,920
is basically a hipopotamus
who just sat on a pile of hamsters

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
saying I swear to God
I wish threre were more hamsters.

40
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,920
But they were not ready to crawl out
from under my giant hippo butt.

41
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,680
There was no shame in this !

42
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,120
If you're gonna have something
that even looks like an election,

43
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,280
you badly need at least
the appearance of an opponent.

44
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,600
And he did get one of those
kind of.

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,080
The only man to stand
against president Sisi

46
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,800
is Mousa Mustafa Mousa,
am openly pro Sisi politician

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,840
who until the day
before to register to run

48
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,040
was part of the campaign
to get Sisi reelected.

49
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,000
It's true ! One of his own supporters
jumped into the race to the last minute

50
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,720
submitting his candidacy
just 15 minutes before the deadline.

51
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,800
Until the morning of his nomination
Mouses's own Facebook page said:

52
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,240
Â½Long live Egypt !
Abdel Fattah el-Sisi for president !"

53
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,520
Maybe it was just a glitch
on Egyptian Facebook.

54
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,960
Like the one on America's Facebook,
where they allowed your personal data

55
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,000
to be accesed by the firm working
to elect Donald Trump president of US.

56
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,560
But look Farmville was superfun,
wasn't it ?

57
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,880
So it was all working
at the end of the day.

58
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,160
But the key rule of a sham election
is make it look legitimate.

59
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,200
On election day,
el-Sisi's election spokesperson

60
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,240
was reassuring Egyptians that was
a completely free and fair election.

61
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,880
Of course it's a democratic process.
The evidence is the Egyptian people,

62
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,600
including big numbers of youth
and elderly have come out to vote.

63
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,240
They are coming to say yes
to Mr. President, yes to Egypt.

64
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,600
We are here to say yes to Egypt.

65
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,080
But saying yes to Egypt is not what
this election is supposed to be about.

66
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,800
The vote here is not
"Is Egypt ?, yes or no".

67
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,640
Unsurprisingly, el-Sisi is projected
to win with 92 percent of the vote.

68
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,120
But in a sign of what a joke
Egyptians considered this to be,

69
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,720
only around 40 percent of voters
bothered to show up,

70
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,360
despite that in a desperate attempt
to make it look legitimate

71
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,280
the National Election Authority
had threatened to impose a fine

72
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,080
on people who failed
to cast their ballots.

73
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,040
And el-Sisi supporters
weren't even above bribes

74
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,360
to get the Egyptians
to go to the polls.

75
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,480
The going rate for a vote
was around 3-5 dollars.

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,080
But heading down
to a polling station

77
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,840
could also have landed you
a box of groceries,

78
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,920
or even half-price tickets
to an amusement park.

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,920
5 bucks and discount tickets
to an amusement park.

80
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,840
Say what you like about el-Sisi,
and if you live in Egypt you can't,

81
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,680
but if this pretty depressing
that 7 years after the Arab Spring

82
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,680
he's trying to win over the voters

83
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,960
the same way a divorced dad
tries to win over his kids.

84
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,680
Finally tonight, a quick update
concerning local news.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,520
The people who bring you
stories like this...

86
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,240
Good evening !
Dana is off tonight.

87
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,600
He was murdered and then set on fire
while celebrating his birthday.

88
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,600
Holly shit !

89
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,080
He needed to put a space between
Dana's whereabouts and his first story

90
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,440
or someone was pissed off that they
weren't invited to Dana's party.

91
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,160
Last year we told you
about Sinclair Broadcast Group

92
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,160
the company which if their acquisition
of Tribune Media is approved,

93
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,600
could soon own local station
reaching 72 percent of TV households.

94
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,800
And in that story we talked
about Sinclair's must runs:

95
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,760
stories the station managers
are forced to include in the broadcast

96
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,360
which often skew
noticeably conservative.

97
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,520
There are
still very much happening,

98
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,280
from an investigation
into the quote-unquote

99
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,240
"deep state
that's undermining President Trump"

100
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,800
to batshit commentaries,

101
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,880
from former Trump aid Boris Epstein,
who incidentally is 35 years old.

102
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,160
We don't have time to get into that,

103
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,280
suffice to say he is the same age
as Nicki Minaj,

104
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,320
while somehow looking
like Jon Favreau's father.

105
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,920
It doesn't make sense
but there isn't time.

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,240
Boris carries a lot of water
for this president.

107
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,440
Remember when Trump
called African countries shitholes ?

108
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,680
This was Boris's hot take.

109
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,000
Media outlets such as CNN
are cursing up a storm.

110
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,720
Not only are the anchors
on the network's cursing left and right

111
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,480
using the word that has been written
in bold letters across their screens.

112
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,280
President Trump said the word once
in a private meeting.

113
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,760
How is it okay to repeat it and splash
it on the screen hundreds of times ?

114
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,160
I believe that makes no sense.

115
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,160
Hold on ! First of all,
what the fuck was up with that zoom ?

116
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,240
He's like that dramatic chipmunk
of disingenous bullshit.

117
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,440
But second people were upset that
Trump used his racist brain and mouth.

118
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,400
If Trump would called Haiti,
El Salvador and Africa

119
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,960
dope ass places
from which we should welcome

120
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,720
a shit tone
of motherfucker immigrants,

121
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,560
I don't think anyone would have been
offended by his vulgarity.

122
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,840
But recently Sinclair took their game
to a new level.

123
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,880
A script leaks for a statement
they wanted local anchors to deliver

124
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,920
warning that the national media outlets
were publishing fake stories

125
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,360
which was echoing one of Trump's
favurite talking points/screaming points.

126
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,000
Ane here was just a taste.

127
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,600
We are concerned
about the troubling trend

128
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,360
of irresponsable
one-sided news stories.

129
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,120
Some members of the media
use their platforms

130
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,160
to pust their own personal bias and
agenda to control what people think.

131
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,400
This is dangerous
to our democracy.

132
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,560
It can be dangerous
when members of the media do that,

133
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,440
like when Boris tries to convince you
that Trump is a good president,

134
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,800
or when I tried to convince you
that the only way Boris Epstein

135
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,840
was born 35 years ago
is he came out of the womb at age 23.

136
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,680
There isn't time, it doesn't make sense
but there isn't time !

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,960
Some anchors complained the press
saying "this is so manipulative"

138
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,200
and "I felt like a prisoner of war
recording a message".

139
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,360
And I will say
I don't know that woman from before,

140
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,560
but just look at her eyes
when her co-anchor is talking.

141
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,640
She looks like she's rather be
murdered and set on fire...

142
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,120
And that statement
is creepy enough,

143
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,640
but when you see how many
local stations were force to read it

144
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,360
and you watch them toghether
as many have been doing online,

145
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,240
you begin to realize the true effect
of Sinclair's reach and power.

146
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,440
Some members of the media...

147
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,680
Some members of the media
use their platforms

148
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,960
to push their own personal bias
and agenda

149
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,960
to control what people think.

150
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,640
It's extremely dangerous
to our democracy !

151
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,440
Nothing says we value intedendent
media like dozens of reporters

152
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,600
forced to repeat the same message
over and over again,

153
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,840
like members
of a brainwashed cult.

154
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,920
I guess what I'm saying here Sinclair
is that as a news organization...

155
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,320
I believe you make no sense.

156
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,480
And now, this !

157
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,440
And now... Baseball's back,

158
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,000
and local news
knows exactly what that means.

159
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,480
The food always taste
so much better at the ballpark.

160
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,200
Ballpark food is the best !

161
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,800
A burger with pulled pork
and cheese curds !

162
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,800
Waffle battered chicken sliders.

163
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,000
All beef hot-dog wrapped
in bacon covered with cheetos.

164
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,360
Buffalo chicken,
mac and cheese,

165
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,520
all filled inside
the center of an onion ring tower.

166
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,520
The Triple B ! The three Bs
are Bacon, Brisket and Bologna.

167
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,880
Your cinnamon bun,
only battered and deep-fried...

168
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,680
Barbecue parfait
with pork and mashed potato.

169
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,440
- Pierogi hoagie.
- Ice cream stuffed doughnot.

170
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,560
The candy cloud waffle cone.

171
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,040
Talk-shows !
Nachos with tater tots...

172
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,680
And apple pie pizza logs.

173
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,560
It's a hot-dog wrapped in a pickle
and deep-fried.

174
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,360
Bacon jam, pulled pork,

175
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,120
barbecue sauce and hot cheetos
on a sweet bun.

176
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,440
How long have you been waiting
to put cheetos on a dish ?

177
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,560
2-3- years.

178
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,280
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns courts,

179
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,160
where millions of Americans
end up every year,

180
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,280
after making a large squirrel
the CEO of a Coal Company.

181
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,560
We've all been there, right ?

182
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,840
Courts are the center
of our judicial system.

183
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,040
They are the backbone
of daytime TV.

184
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,960
A college student brings his mommy.
Judge Judy !

185
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,920
Don't get me preaching up !

186
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,600
The Verdict,
with Judge Hachett.

187
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,040
A show
that's making a difference !

188
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,520
You need to be sober
seven days a week !

189
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,960
Fraternity court !

190
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,400
I know cuz I'm not stupid that you're
a liar then and you're a liar know.

191
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,560
Tle People's Court !
A Pack of Dogs ! Draw Blood !

192
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,320
This is a confession !
This is a note by the dog.

193
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,840
I've had all my shots.

194
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,880
Hot Bench !

195
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,200
I know that looks like
a fun episode of Hot Bench,

196
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,800
but you should know that cute dog
confessed to murdering 14 people,

197
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,520
so it's not quite as fun
as they made it look.

198
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,000
We're gonna focus on a type of justice
you don't get to watch on TV.

199
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,440
It concerns immigration courts.
You not know much about it,

200
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,800
but are hugely important
to a significant number of people,

201
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,480
like gefilte fish,
or insane clown posse.

202
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,080
You may have seen
multiple stories

203
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,800
of ice agents raiding workplaces
and hauling people away.

204
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,400
While those stories are horryfying, the
place manny of those people end up,

205
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,000
immigration courts,
are no less trobling.

206
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,960
There are around 60 of them,
all over the country,

207
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,960
and hundreds of thousands of people
go through them,

208
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,440
pleading their case
against deportation.

209
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,800
They are hugely consequential
and the stakes in this cases

210
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,480
can be incredibly high, as one girl
awaiting a hearing can atest.

211
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,760
What would happen
if we sent you home ?

212
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,520
They're gonna kill me !

213
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,120
They're gonna kill me
and my family.

214
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,520
No child should have to worry about
whether they're going to be murdered.

215
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,520
The biggest thing
they should be worrying about

216
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,080
are whether they can sit
with the cool kids

217
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,920
and how they can please
Slenderman.

218
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,040
That last one is ridiculous,
because remember kids,

219
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,960
Slenderman already loves you
just the way you are.

220
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,520
So this is a critical potentially
life-and-death process.

221
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,200
Sadly, the system is a complete mess
and don't take that from me,

222
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,840
but from multiple current and former
immigration court judges.

223
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,440
Most people would be incredulous
at what happens in immigration court

224
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,120
and what sometimes passes
for due process.

225
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,080
Our courts are dysfunctional.

226
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,640
We're doing death penalty cases
in a traffic court setting.

227
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,880
Death penalty cases
in traffic court.

228
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,480
It's something we shouldn't be doing, in
a place that we shouldn't be doing it,

229
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,240
like having a cock fight
in an emergency room.

230
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,720
Or doing coke
in a build-a-bear workshop.

231
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,880
It's a crazy idea,
it gets stuck in the bear's hair.

232
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,240
So how did this system
get so broken ?

233
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,920
A surge of immigration
from Central America

234
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,160
ramped-up immigration enforcement,
and a "glacial" rate of hiring judges

235
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,360
have combined to create
a massive backlog of cases.

236
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,560
More that 617 000 immigration cases
are now backlogged.

237
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,640
That number has more than doubled
since 2009.

238
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,080
It's as if they have forgotten us,
says Andres,

239
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,480
one of the immigrants
waiting for hearing in San Francisco,

240
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,960
where the average wait time
is three years.

241
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,640
In Miami,
the wait is about a year and a half,

242
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,520
and it's much worse in cities
like San Antonio, Atlanta and Chicago.

243
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,960
The estimated wait time in Chicago
is five years.

244
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,400
If you're stuck in that line
that's not good to your case.

245
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,080
Evidence can become stale
and witnesses can disappear or die.

246
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,880
Yet, over 600 000 cases
pilled up endlessly,

247
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,400
like Bed, Bath and Beyond coupons,
New Yorker magazines

248
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,600
and episodes of Ken Burns's
Vietnam documentary.

249
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,520
It's good but I'm never in the mood
and I never ever will be.

250
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,840
Ever !

251
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,120
Issues go deeper
that just long wait times.

252
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,880
While immigration courts have
the trappings of a criminal court,

253
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,880
you can wind up there from arrest,
be detained awaiting your hearing,

254
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,320
against the government,
there are actually civil courts,

255
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,520
because this is not
a criminal trial.

256
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,920
Their only task is deciding if you
can stay in the country. That's it.

257
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,920
Things you might assume someone
there would have access to,

258
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,000
they don't and the first
big one is this.

259
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,320
Unlike criminal court,
in immigration court

260
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,520
the federal government is not
required to provide lawyers.

261
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,200
If you can't afford a lawyer,
you have to defend yourself,

262
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,360
a terrible idea.

263
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,640
Think of an immigration hearing like
surgery: you can try do it yourself,

264
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,200
but if want to see your family again,
get a professional to help you.

265
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,360
Only 37% of immigrants in these courts
have counsel,

266
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,480
the majority are appearing in front
of a judge without a lawyer.

267
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,400
Some, in particular,
really need one.

268
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,360
Many undocumented children
that walk into the court house

269
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,520
don't have an attorney
and must represent themselves.

270
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,960
Children from 2 to 17 years old
are appearing by themselves,

271
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,120
sitting there without a clue
about what's happening.

272
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,880
Ridiculous. Can't let a 2 year old
unsupervised in court,

273
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:26,280
not even in a bouncy castle, they'll
come out covered in glitter,

274
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,920
holding a broken beer bottle
and a dead bird.

275
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,400
How did they get them in there ?
Who knows ?

276
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,240
They can't be left alone for a second
and the bird has been in their mouth.

277
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,840
Deal with that reality !

278
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,640
Sending kids in court without
representation might seem crazy,

279
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,840
some judges
are apparently fine with it.

280
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,120
When a lawsuit was filed arguing
all kids need lawyers,

281
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,800
Jack Weil, an assistant chief
immigration judge, suggested

282
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,800
that's not necessarily the case.

283
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,520
I've taught immigration law
to three-years-old and four-years-olds.

284
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,720
It takes a lot of time,
it takes a lot of patience.

285
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,440
They get it.

286
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,600
It's not the most efficient,
but it can be done.

287
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:17,520
No, it can't ! You can't teach
immigration law to a three-year-old.

288
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,480
Can't even explain to a child that
age that Elmo isn't his best friend.

289
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,880
Elmo's a celebrity,
he's never even heard of you.

290
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,040
Your relantionship
is completely asymmetrical.

291
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,360
One lawyer put judge Weil's
three-year-olds theory to the test

292
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,200
in the single greatest mock trial
ever recorded.

293
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,240
Do you speak English
as your native language ?

294
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,120
Yeah, I like my balloon !

295
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,480
I like your balloon, too.
What is your best language ?

296
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,400
I placed a tie over fairies...
Blue.

297
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,000
Where were you born ?

298
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,240
It was mommy and...

299
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,520
You feel you can represent yourself
in immgiration courts ?

300
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,560
- Right ! Are you excited to do it ?
- Yeah.

301
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,760
Yeah ! Of course, she knows all
the most important legal principles.

302
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,520
If I like my balloon,
you mustn't deport soon

303
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,640
and if I place a tire of a ferry...

304
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,080
... an asylum.

305
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,840
That lawyer did a series
of videos with kids,

306
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,080
but my favorite is this one...

307
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,640
If you were removed, would you like
to designate a country of removal ?

308
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,320
- Yeah.
- What country would that be ?

309
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,720
Pizza.

310
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:02,400
Yeah ! You laugh now, but it won't be
cute when she's deported to Papa John.

311
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,440
That's technically pizza and that is
why children need lawyers.

312
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,720
Whether you have a lawyer or not

313
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,800
your odds of success
may be dictated by where you are.

314
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,960
In San Francisco, immigrants are
deported in 36% of cases.

315
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,520
In Charlotte,
the number jumps to 84%.

316
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,520
In New York City, only 24%
of cases result in deportation.

317
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,040
In Atlanta,
the rate is almost 90%.

318
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,520
While the merits
of every case are different,

319
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,160
that is an alarming disparity
between courts.

320
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,040
The only thing that should vary
that much by region

321
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,520
is the rate of Jeff Dunham fans
per capita.

322
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,400
Regardless of where you are, that
number should never be 90%.

323
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,680
Immigration courts are not nearly
as independent as they should be.

324
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,960
You might assume they be part
of the judicial branch,

325
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,760
immigration courts are actually part
of the executive branch.

326
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,920
They're run by the DOJ, being subject
to shifting political priorities.

327
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,480
Now, the boss of all these judges
is Jeff Sessions,

328
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,240
the only cabinet member allowed
to fly as lap infant on a flight.

329
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,160
He has made it pretty clear
what his priorities are.

330
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,880
For those seeking improper
and illegal entry into this country,

331
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:33,000
be forwarned:
this is a new era, the Trump era.

332
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:38,720
There's a specific type of person who
grins when saying "Trump era".

333
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,440
People with Trump's name,
Trump's hats

334
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,160
and the only person in America
still getting a kick out of Covefe.

335
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,360
I don't agree with everything
the guy says, but we had some laughs.

336
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,760
It's not a word. "Covefe" is not
a word. That's why it's funny.

337
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,080
Priceless !

338
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,600
Sessions has a weird amount of power
over immigration courts.

339
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,720
He can refer cases to himself,

340
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,360
which means
personally reviewing decisions.

341
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,680
He picked up a case concerning
a woman eligible for asylum,

342
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,880
based on domestic violence
that she suffered for years

343
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,920
under her husband in El Salvador.

344
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,000
If he overturns that decision,
not only she could be deported,

345
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,160
but he can set precedents, making it
harder for other victims to get asylum.

346
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:33,280
While Session isn't the last person
I'd want to set precedents,

347
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,360
he's near the bottom of that list,
before OJ Simpson,

348
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,600
Johnny Depp and Mr. Peanut.

349
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,120
If you don't know what that
last one is referring to,

350
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,280
google Mr. Peanut domestic violence,
I have no idea what you'll find,

351
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,760
but give it a try,
we might all be surprised.

352
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,720
When you combine all this factors,
backlogged courts,

353
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,520
lack of representation and judges
without full independence,

354
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,000
you can have cases that
don't even resemble justice.

355
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,920
The New Yorker told the story
of a woman in Honduras,

356
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,240
who asked them
to identify her as Elena.

357
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,400
MS-13 killed two of her brothers
and shot her sister.

358
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,840
She fled to America,
turned herself in to Border Patrol.

359
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:23,160
DHS said she didn't qualify for asylum,
she couldn't prove "credible fear",

360
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,880
she appealed, requesting
a hearing with an immigration judge.

361
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,080
I'm about to play that hearing
for you in its entirety.

362
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,720
This is the whole thing.

363
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,280
I have read
what the asylum officer wrote.

364
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,880
You told that some gang member
became infatuated with you,

365
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,640
wanted you to be with him,
to open a bank account,

366
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:52,240
so the criminal proceeds from the gang
could be placed there.

367
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,960
- And you refused.
- Yes. I said no.

368
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,120
Did you move to any other city
in Honduras before coming to the US ?

369
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,520
No.

370
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,800
The government of the US doesn't
afford your protection for this reason.

371
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,480
I affirm
the asylum officer's decision.

372
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,960
That was it. Did you move ? No.
Okay, goodbye.

373
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,960
Elena was deported to Honduras,
where she was assaulted at gunpoint

374
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,640
by the man she fled,
her fear was pretty credible.

375
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,200
We trimmed the parts where
a translator interprets,

376
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,920
but the full hearing lasted
one minute and 43 seconds.

377
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:38,400
There were only two questions.
That Hot Bench episode at the start

378
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:44,080
was eight minutes long and
we counted 32 questions.

379
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,240
There should have been one:
how did that dog write this letter ?

380
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,640
Case dismissed.

381
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,280
In some cases, deportations do
turn out to be a death sentence.

382
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,080
Take Constantino Morales,

383
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,040
a mexican police officer
targeted by a drug cartel.

384
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,440
Fled to the US, ended up
in an immigration court in Nebraska.

385
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,600
Couldn't afford an attorney,
so he represented himself

386
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,920
before of a judge who opts to deport
84% of the time.

387
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,080
Morales lost his case and filmed
this message after that decision.

388
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,440
I am being deported.
They are deporting me.

389
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,480
It was four years of fighting.

390
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
My request was denied,
but you have to fight to the end.

391
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,800
Don't be scared. No worries.
Life goes on.

392
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,880
He was deported back to Mexico
and six months and 29 days after,

393
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,520
he was killed and that is
heartbreaking obviously.

394
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,200
This whole system is broken,
so the question really is:

395
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,520
how can it be fixed ?

396
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,320
Sessions wants to hire more judges,
which the system does need,

397
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,560
but he wants judges to move faster
and advocated for increased scrutiny

398
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,120
of what he calls fake asylum claims.

399
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:02,680
Immigration courts are like sex.
The way to improve them

400
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,120
is rarely to say:
"let's do it a lot faster and meaner,"

401
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,520
"and let's have Jeff Sessions
overseeing the whole thing."

402
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,520
The truth here is we are
going to need big changes.

403
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,680
The biggest change would be to make
the courts independent from DOJ,

404
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:25,680
which can't happen overnight
or, under this Congress, at all.

405
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,200
We should absolutely fix
the stupidest problem of all:

406
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,880
nobody, particularly children,
should have to represent themselves.

407
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,880
Because children
do not understand the law.

408
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,440
Having them alone in a courtroom
is a terrible idea.

409
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,960
To prove it, I give you the stupidest
new court show imaginable !

410
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,000
You've seen a lot
of corporate shows.

411
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,480
But you've never seen
one like this.

412
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,080
Order !

413
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,320
That's right. In this courtroom,
everyone is three or four years old.

414
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,480
My favorite food is mango.

415
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,280
Everyone that is
except the defendant.

416
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,960
What is this ?

417
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,800
Is this a joke ?

418
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,960
No. This is "Tot Bench".
In this week's episode,

419
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,240
this arsonist
is in the hot seat.

420
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,040
- You're bad.
- Bad !

421
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,320
- Seriously ?
- You're guilty.

422
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,440
Object ! Just object !

423
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,320
Object to you !

424
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,800
It's object, not "the dot"...

425
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,160
He's got the best legal advice
a three-year-old can give.

426
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:46,920
What's the difference
between a banana and a cow ?

427
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,680
I don't know. What ?

428
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,560
A banana is yellow.

429
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,360
"Tot Bench" has everything,
a bailiff, a stenographer...

430
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,200
- Do you even know my name ?
- David Schwimmer.

431
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,080
How do you even know
who David Schwimmer is ?

432
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,320
"Hacksaw Ridge".

433
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,960
Schwimmer wasn't in "Hacksaw Ridge".
The stenographer is leaving now.

434
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,560
A courtroom artist...

435
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,440
So there's a sketch artist now ?
Great ! Sure she's teribble.

436
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,440
That's so good !

437
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,520
And, of course,
judge Riley.

438
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,440
- How did you become a judge ?
- I believed in myself to be a judge.

439
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,200
- How long have you been doing this ?
- 14 years.

440
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,200
You've been doing this
for 14 years, but you're four ?

441
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,440
Yeah !

442
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,880
It's a case with twists and turns.

443
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,400
There was another judge.
What happened ?

444
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,040
She wet her pants.

445
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,000
And snacks,
so many snacks...

446
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,320
Will anyone share their snacks
with me ?

447
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,120
You'll even see a lawyer turn
on his own client.

448
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,960
Tell them
I didn't burn down the hospital.

449
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,840
You burned down the hospital.

450
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,160
Sorry.

451
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,520
You did burned down the hospital.

452
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,400
You know what ? I am guilty.
There you go !

453
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm guilty...

454
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,880
"Tot Bench" ! Is it stupid ? Sure.

455
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,960
But is it dumber than how immigration
courts are run ? Barely.

456
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,840
The judge sentenced me
to a jillion years.

457
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,480
A jillion is not even a number.
Who threw that ?

458
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,680
That's our show. See you next week.
Goodnight !

459
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,320
- You know my dog's name ?
- What ?

460
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,000
- Wolf-wolfy.
- That's your dog's name ?

461
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,160
That's a good name for a dog.

462
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,360
Quiet !

463
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,240
- Is that true ?
- Yes.

464
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,360
Your dog's name is Wolf-Wolfy ?

465
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,240
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

466
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,200
END OF EPISODE 6,
SEASON V
