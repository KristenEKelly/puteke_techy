1
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,600
Welcome, welcome, welcome to
Last Week Tonight!

2
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,400
I´m John Oliver.

3
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,700
Thank you so much
for joining us.

4
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,300
Just on for a quick
recap of the week.

5
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,700
And we begin with:
Racists.

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,600
They´re the reasons that 911
now has to answer calls with

7
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,700
Is this a real emergency
or is there just a black person nearby?

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,800
Now, as we take this show,
right now tonight.

9
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,700
The Unite The Right 2 rallye
is winding down.

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,300
A massive dozens of white nationalists
apparently gathered in DC

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,200
where they were met by hundreds
of counter protesters

12
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,400
calling them all assholes.

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,700
And look, while that numerical discrepency
is hardening

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,400
let´s not get too reasured here.

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,300
Because this week also brought
a visceral reminder

16
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,800
of the problems that we´re facing.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
One year after Charlottesville,
look at this numbers.

18
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:18,900
49%, half of americans believe
their president is a racist.

19
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,900
Every time I look at those numbers
it just stuns me.

20
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,400
Yeah, because it is stunning.

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,900
Because it is both shocking
that it´s 49%

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,300
and it is equally shocking
that it´s only 49%.

23
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
Because it´s not like
he´s been hiding it.

24
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,800
It has been his brand for decades now.

25
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,800
It´s like only 49% of people
thinking that Kermit is a frog.

26
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,200
It´s in his name.

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,100
Whether you like or hate
that about him

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,600
you have to admit,
he´s a fucking frog.

29
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,900
Today´s demonstration is just
the culmination of a week

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,300
in wich America´s regular
dog wissel racism

31
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,900
became uncomfortably loud.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,700
Perhaps there´s no better example of this

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,700
than FOX News host Laura Ingraham,

34
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,100
who caused a real stir with this.

35
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,000
In some parts of the country

36
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,600
it does seem like the america
that we know and love

37
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,700
doesn't exist anymore.

38
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,000
Massive demographic changes

39
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,500
have been foisted upon the american people,

40
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,400
and they're changes
that none of us ever voted for

41
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,800
and most of us don't like.

42
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,600
Much of this is related to both
illegal and, in some cases,

43
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,900
legal immigration that,
of course, progressives love.

44
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,200
She just came right out and said it,

45
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,600
in a scripted commentary,

46
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,000
straight down the camera,

47
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,400
knowing her mic was on.

48
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,500
No "economic anxiety", no
"some of them are good people".

49
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,300
Just "I don't want people who
don't look like this here."

50
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,200
You almost want to give her
credit for honesty there

51
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,500
and then deduct twice
as much credit

52
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,300
because she's just being honest
about how racist she is.

53
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,900
And while Ingraham
later tried to say

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,500
that her remarks had
nothing to do with race.

55
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,800
It is worth noting that no less
an authority than David Duke,

56
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,200
former Grand Wizard of the Klan,

57
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,600
called it "one of the most
important truthful monologues

58
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,900
in the history of
the mainstream media."

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,500
And when the former head of the klan

60
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,900
likes what you're doing,

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,700
that should give you real pause.

62
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,900
Let me put it this way,

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,500
if immediately after this taping,

64
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,300
Dr. Larry Nassar caught me
in the hallway and said,

65
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,000
"Hey, man, loved the show!",

66
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,700
I'd think long and hard about
what the fuck I just said.

67
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,600
But, look, for now,

68
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,000
let's move on to Saudi Arabia,

69
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,700
the country that contains Mecca,

70
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,900
which is like the muslim mecca.

71
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,300
That country's crown prince,
Mohamad Bin Salman,

72
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,100
has been on a bit
of a PR blitz lately,

73
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,000
trying to sell himself
as a moderate reformer

74
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,900
and doing everything
women to drive,

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,400
to sitting down for a softball
interview with "60 minutes",

76
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,300
to hosting a WWE event in Jeddah.

77
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,200
But recently, it's been
harder for them

78
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,300
to hold on to their new
friendly image,

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,900
not just because of their ongoing
role in airstrikes in yemen,

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,400
but also because of a spat
they got into this week

81
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,800
with the last country you'd expect.

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,100
Saudi Arabia has suspended
diplomatic ties with Canada,

83
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,400
halting new trade and
investment dealings.

84
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,900
The saudis are responding
to Canada's call

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,200
for the kingdom to release
a jailed women's rights activist.

86
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,700
Yeah, it's true.

87
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,300
Saudi Arabia is fighting
with Canada.

88
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,300
And that is not a conflict
that you'd naturally expect.

89
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,200
It's like hearing Katy Perry
is in a celebrity feud

90
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,500
with Wallace Shawn.

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I didn't even know that
they knew each other,

92
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,300
but, ok, I guess
if this is happening,

93
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,300
I'm team Wallace.

94
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,400
Now, in response,

95
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,400
in response, Saudi Arabia has,

96
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,350
among other things,

97
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,300
expelled the canadian ambassador
and cut trade ties,

98
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,100
and has indicated
that it will continue

99
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,300
until Canada apologizes,

100
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,300
which seemed pretty likely.

101
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,900
It is Canada.

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,600
But when he was asked about it,

103
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,900
their prime minister,
Justin Trudeau,

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,700
Ottawa 10 and New York 7,

105
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,200
instead of saying "sorry",
or "soh-rry",

106
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,300
he unexpectedly said this.

107
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,500
As the minister has said
and as we will repeat,

108
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,300
Canada will always speak
strongly and clearly

109
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,700
in private and in public

110
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,250
on questions of human rights.

111
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,550
Shots fired.

112
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,650
Now, I know that sounded pretty mild,

113
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,050
but remember, he's canadian.

114
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,850
So, that calculated non-apology

115
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,650
is canada's equivalent of
dousing a car with saudi oil

116
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,750
and setting it on fire,
like Angela Basset

117
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,150
in "Waiting to Exhale."

118
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,850
And after that non-apology,

119
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,300
things escalated in perhaps

120
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,500
the most inappropriate possible way.

121
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,800
Saudi Arabia's state media tweeted
this now-deleted graphic yesterday,

122
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,600
appearing to show
an Air Canada airliner

123
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,400
heading towards the Toronto skyline

124
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,800
with text saying

125
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,900
"sticking one's nose
where it doesn't belong."

126
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,700
Holy shit.

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,100
A plane flying toward
a building as a threat

128
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,100
is a bold move from Saudi Arabia.

129
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,010
And while they later
said it was only meant

130
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,310
to suggest Canada's
ambassador returning home,

131
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,910
here's a little test to figure out

132
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,010
if your meme might come off
as a little 9/11-y.

133
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,210
One, is there a tower?

134
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,810
Two, is there a plane flying
toward that tower?

135
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,410
And three, am I Saudi Arabia?

136
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:11,610
Because if the answer to all
three of those questions is yes,

137
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,010
the odds of people thinking of 9/11 are,

138
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,710
I'd say, around 15 out of 19.

139
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,910
Give or take.

140
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,210
Now, finally this week,

141
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,210
Lithuania.

142
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,610
Or as it's more commonly known,

143
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,810
"I don´t know, one
of the Polands maybe?"

144
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,410
Lithuania's capitol city is Vilnius,

145
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,110
and not many people
know much about it,

146
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,010
which is why it launched a daring
tourism campaign this week.

147
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,810
And I could tell you about it,
but I think it's probably better

148
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,510
that you just watch it for yourself.

149
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,910
That's real.

150
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,310
That is real.

151
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,510
The new tourism campaign
of Vilnius is

152
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,910
"Vilnius: The G-Spot of Europe."

153
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,410
And if you're thinking,

154
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,210
"why is Vilnius
the g-spot of Europe?"

155
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,910
which, admittedly sounds like
a riddle on a popsicle stick

156
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,710
you'd find in Roman
Polanski's freezer.

157
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,810
According to this actual
poster from the campaign,

158
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,710
it's because "nobody
knows where it is,

159
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,610
but when you find it, it's amazing."

160
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,010
And, look, that logic,

161
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,410
I've got to give it to them,

162
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,910
that logic is incredible.

163
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,610
But by that logic, it also means

164
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,610
Vilnius is the Waldo of Europe,

165
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,610
the Jeremy Piven's hairline of Europe,

166
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,710
and the I.D. Channel of Europe.

167
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,910
Did you know the I.D. Channel
has a show called

168
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,310
"Wives with Knives"?

169
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,510
And another one called

170
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,010
"Southern Fried Homicide"?

171
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,910
And another one called
"Bride Killa"?

172
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,210
That's "killa" with an "a."

173
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,310
All on I.D.

174
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,210
And I realize no one knows
where that channel is,

175
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,510
but when you find it, it's amazing.

176
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,810
It's basically the Vilnius
of basic cable.

177
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,210
Now, look, it's clearly a bold tone

178
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,210
for an official tourism campaign,

179
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,910
and some in the national government

180
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,010
were not exactly thrilled with it
for a very specific reason.

181
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,610
The government chancellor was
dissatisfied by the fact

182
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,310
the advertisement of this campaign

183
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,910
will be published on
International Orgasm Day,

184
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,110
as well as before the official
visit of the pope in Lithuania.

185
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,010
Okay, so first there.

186
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,910
First, don't worry about the Pope.

187
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,710
He should be very into
a g-spot campaign,

188
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,010
since his main thing is believing

189
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,410
in something no one can
scientifically prove exists.

190
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,510
And second, you did hear right,

191
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,210
International Orgasm Day

192
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,910
was actually on the 8th.

193
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,010
And that means you forgot to
call your mom again.

194
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,610
But don't worry, you can just
send her one of those

195
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,210
"Happy Belated Orgasm Day"
edible arrangements.

196
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,710
That's what they're for.
She'll love it.

197
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,410
Now, will this tourism ad
make people come,

198
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,310
literally or metaphorically?

199
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,410
Well, no and no, respectively.

200
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,610
But in a way, it's already worked,

201
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,710
because do you think

202
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,410
we were going to spend time
talking about lithuania tonight,

203
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,910
if they hadn't done this?

204
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:42,810
Of course not.

205
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,110
And that is why, if other cities
are smart here,

206
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,910
they will follow lithuania's lead

207
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,710
and come up with their own
adults-only tourism slogans.

208
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,910
Take a look.

209
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,410
Tokyo, the Prostate of the World.

210
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,710
It takes some effort to get to,
but it's worth it.

211
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,210
San Francisco, the Shower Sex of America.

212
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:06,010
Always a better idea in theory
and wet in exactly the wrong way.

213
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,510
Las Vegas.

214
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:11,110
It's like the anus, in that
it's objectively unattractive

215
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,810
and too many men refuse to shut up

216
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,310
about that one time they went there.

217
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,510
Oslo.

218
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,810
Europe's Clitoris.

219
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,010
It's not so much that
it's hard to find

220
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,010
as that people have no idea
what to do once they get there.

221
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,210
Boston.

222
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,010
The Semen of America.

223
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,110
It's white, gross, and weird.

224
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,410
The North Pole.

225
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,910
Earth's survix.

226
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,310
Once you hit it, you've
probably gone too far.

227
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,510
Venice.

228
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,710
It's like an old man's testicles.

229
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,010
Historic and sinking at an alarming rate.

230
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,310
Moving on.

231
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,710
So our main story tonight
concerns astroturfing,

232
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,210
which sounds like a new teen trend
of fucking artificial grass

233
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,710
while eating cascade pods.

234
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,210
That's right, the teens have
moved on from tide.

235
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,510
It's all about cascade now.

236
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,710
Astroturfing is the practice
of corporations or

237
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,510
political groups disguising themselves

238
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,810
as spontaneous, authentic
popular movements.

239
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,810
It's basically fake grassroots.

240
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,910
That's why they call it

241
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,110
"astroturfing."

242
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,610
It's a very funny, very clever name.

243
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,210
Now, you're probably familiar

244
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,910
with astroturfing as a concept

245
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,710
from seeing ads by groups with
generic, populist-sounding names like

246
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,710
"Americans against Food Taxes"

247
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,410
delivering weirdly specific
messages like these.

248
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:30,010
Washington is talking about
a new tax on juice drinks and soda.

249
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,210
They say it's only pennies.

250
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,710
Well, those pennies add up when
you're trying to feed a family.

251
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,410
Washington, if you're listening,

252
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,410
what doesn't seem like much to you

253
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,210
can be a lot to us.

254
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:47,110
Tell congress no taxes on
juice drinks and sodas.

255
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,910
Now, it won't surprise you to learn

256
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,910
that "Americans against Food Taxes"

257
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,710
was not started by regular americans

258
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,010
pooling their resources together

259
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,610
to take out a large ad buy

260
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,610
on national tv about their
number one problem priority:

261
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,410
a proposed soda tax.

262
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,210
No, it was a front group for
the food and beverage industry,

263
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,510
which makes much more sense.

264
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,010
Soda companies have a lot of money,

265
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,310
at least enough to convince Lebron James

266
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,110
to pretend he drinks Sprite.

267
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,210
Sprite: diabetes you can taste!

268
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,910
And while you might think,

269
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,410
"well yeah, that's obvious, I'd never

270
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,110
I'd never fall for astroturf
bullshit like that."

271
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,110
Don't be quite so sure,

272
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,910
because with dark money surging

273
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,810
in the wake of decisions like
citizens united,

274
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,410
astroturf techniques are now becoming

275
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,810
more sophisticated, effective
and dangerous,

276
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,210
and they are not going away.

277
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,010
So tonight, we thought
it might be useful

278
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,910
to take a look at some
of those techniques

279
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,710
to help us better spot
them in the future.

280
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,310
And let's just start
with the names themselves,

281
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,210
because sometimes,

282
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,810
groups are created with
deliberately misleading names.

283
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,110
For instance, the group
"Save Our Tips",

284
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,410
which purportedly speaks
for waitstaff,

285
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,810
is an anti-minimum wage
increase group

286
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,610
funded by restaurant owners.

287
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,410
The "National Wetlands Coalition"

288
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,610
worked on behalf of oil companies
and real estate developers.

289
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,010
And the "American Council
on Science and Health"

290
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,710
has been funded by,
among other things,

291
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,110
fracking interests,

292
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,310
soda companies,

293
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,710
e-cigarette companies,

294
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,310
and chemical manufacturers.

295
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,410
So it's pure straight-up
opposite world.

296
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,110
It's like if this show was called

297
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,110
"Funnytime Happy Hour
with chuckle-hunk John Oliver".

298
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,110
It's just demonstrably false.

299
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,810
We can't back that shit up.

300
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,610
And, look, it's not always easy

301
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,310
to spot exactly what
a group's motive is,

302
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,410
especially with an ad like this.

303
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,610
Tony here, and I'm mad!

304
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,310
What's with you people tossing money

305
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,410
at the humane society
of the United States?

306
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,010
These HSUS losers aren't
even affiliated

307
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,310
with your local pet shelter.

308
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:39,110
For more information, go to
humanewatch.org.

309
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,710
That is a very strange ad.

310
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:42,710
Because first of all,

311
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,410
if you're going to have a talking dog,

312
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,910
why would you make him
such a gruff asshole?

313
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,910
"Hey, I'm Tony, and I'm mad!

314
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,810
The Humane Society
is a bunch of losers,

315
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,210
and if you disagree,
you can suck my dog dick!"

316
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,910
And second,

317
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,610
who would take out an attack ad
on the Humane Society?

318
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,810
A rival, even humaner Society?

319
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,710
"Puppy Mills Self-loading Dogs"?

320
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,710
It's impossible to say for sure.

321
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:09,910
All I can tell you is,

322
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,110
that ad is the work of Rick Berman,

323
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,110
a PR expert who's known
in the industry

324
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,410
as "Dr. Evil".

325
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,410
He is known for his defenses
of controversial products,

326
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,710
from secondhand smoke,

327
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,110
to trans fats, to payday loans.

328
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,910
He's also created nonprofit groups

329
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,810
that have fought regulation
of all those things.

330
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,210
In fact, it's one of those groups,

331
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,510
the Center for Consumer Freedom,

332
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,210
which was credited on that
Humane Society attack ad.

333
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,910
So, is the Center
for Consumer Freedom

334
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,510
a front group for Berman's
corporate clients?

335
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,310
Is it, at all, relevant that

336
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,010
Rick Berman has shown up
at events for the pork industry,

337
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,610
an industry which has been targeted

338
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,110
by the humane society in the past

339
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,710
for the use of gestation crates,

340
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,410
or, as Rick Berman
insists on calling them,

341
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,610
"maternity pens"?

342
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,210
I can't say.

343
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,810
I legally can´t say.

344
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,910
I want to.

345
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,210
I badly want to.

346
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,510
But I've been explicitly
told I can't.

347
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,110
You can probably guess, but I
can't say it out loud.

348
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,110
What I can say is

349
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,510
that berman rejects any accusation

350
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,810
that he runs front groups
for corporate clients,

351
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,410
saying "there is no front

352
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,710
because there is total transparency."

353
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,810
Which is a little odd,

354
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,510
considering we don't know who is
behind many of his campaigns.

355
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,310
And that message of transparency

356
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,210
does seem to significantly change

357
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,010
when he's behind closed doors,

358
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,910
because here is audio of Berman

359
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,510
pitching his services to
a group of oil executives.

360
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,110
People always ask me
one question all the time.

361
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,910
They say, "how do I know
that I won't be found out

362
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,710
as a supporter of what
you're doing?"

363
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,910
We run all of their stuff through
nonprofit organizations

364
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,310
that are insulated from having
to disclose donors.

365
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,010
There is total anonymity.

366
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,110
See?

367
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,210
Transparency.

368
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,210
But, look, he is right.

369
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,010
There is total anonymity.

370
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,410
And just as a general rule,

371
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,810
if the most common question
you get asked is,

372
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,910
"How do I know no one will find out

373
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,010
I'm doing business with you?",
that's not a great sign.

374
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,610
It's the same privacy guarantee

375
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,510
that Hardee's gives
all of its customers.

376
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,210
"Don't worry,

377
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,110
none of your friends,
family, or coworkers

378
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,810
will ever find out you´ve
been doing this.

379
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,610
Now go and enjoy your Monster Thickburger

380
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,010
before the horse meat gets cold."

381
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,910
But astroturfing is more,

382
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,010
way more than just funneling money

383
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,610
through nonprofit front groups.

384
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,210
Groups can also recruit
questionable experts

385
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,910
to lend their arguments credibility.

386
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,610
There are multiple examples of this,

387
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,310
but my favorite concerns
a group called

388
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,010
"Citizens for Fire Safety."

389
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,310
A few years back,

390
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,810
health officials in California
wanted to remove

391
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,510
a requirement that furniture

392
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,310
contain chemical flame retardants,

393
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,110
as they had been linked to cancer.

394
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,210
But Citizens for Fire Safety

395
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,610
produced a burn surgeon,

396
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,010
Dr. David Heimbach,

397
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,518
who argued for keeping

398
00:15:40,618 --> 00:15:42,518
all of those flame
retardant requirements

399
00:15:42,618 --> 00:15:44,718
by telling them a pretty
memorable story.

400
00:15:45,518 --> 00:15:47,618
A seven-week-old baby
was in a crib,

401
00:15:47,718 --> 00:15:51,518
laying on a fire-retardant mattress

402
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,818
on a non-fire retardant pillow.

403
00:15:55,118 --> 00:15:58,118
Mom put a candle in the crib,

404
00:15:58,218 --> 00:15:59,818
the candle fell over,

405
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,618
the baby sustained a 50% burn.

406
00:16:03,218 --> 00:16:05,618
The entire upper half of her
body was burned.

407
00:16:05,718 --> 00:16:08,018
Now, this is a tiny little person,

408
00:16:08,118 --> 00:16:10,718
no bigger than my italian
greyhound at home.

409
00:16:11,218 --> 00:16:12,718
She ultimately died

410
00:16:12,818 --> 00:16:16,718
after about three weeks of pain
and misery in the hospital.

411
00:16:16,818 --> 00:16:19,318
Now, that sounds horrifying,

412
00:16:19,418 --> 00:16:21,918
but there are some weird things
about what he just said.

413
00:16:22,018 --> 00:16:24,218
First, I don't know why he felt
the need to compare

414
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:27,218
the size of a baby
to his italian greyhound.

415
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:30,518
Everyone knows what size a baby is.

416
00:16:30,818 --> 00:16:32,918
Nobody's never seen a baby.

417
00:16:33,018 --> 00:16:34,618
So, wait, it's like a person,

418
00:16:34,718 --> 00:16:35,318
but smaller?

419
00:16:35,418 --> 00:16:36,118
Tell me more.

420
00:16:36,218 --> 00:16:37,318
Does it use stilts?

421
00:16:37,418 --> 00:16:38,818
How does it board a bus?

422
00:16:38,918 --> 00:16:41,518
What I'm picturing is something
about the size of five hamsters

423
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:42,318
taped together

424
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,718
or a very small lawnmower.

425
00:16:44,818 --> 00:16:47,218
Am I around the right ballpark here?"

426
00:16:47,718 --> 00:16:48,518
But second,

427
00:16:48,618 --> 00:16:50,018
if part of you there was wondering,

428
00:16:50,118 --> 00:16:52,518
"Hold on, who puts a candle

429
00:16:52,618 --> 00:16:54,118
in their baby's crib?",

430
00:16:54,218 --> 00:16:55,518
you're not alone.

431
00:16:55,618 --> 00:16:57,118
Journalists with the Chicago Tribune

432
00:16:57,218 --> 00:16:58,518
wondered the exact same thing,

433
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,618
and they soon discovered
that two years earlier,

434
00:17:00,718 --> 00:17:03,718
Heimbach had testified before
a different California panel

435
00:17:03,818 --> 00:17:06,118
telling a weirdly similar story.

436
00:17:06,918 --> 00:17:09,518
I will tell you about a child
I took care of in April.

437
00:17:09,618 --> 00:17:10,818
Mom had a candle

438
00:17:11,218 --> 00:17:13,018
sitting beside the bed,

439
00:17:13,518 --> 00:17:15,618
left the room for seven minutes.

440
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,618
For reasons we don't know,

441
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:20,218
the candle turned over.

442
00:17:20,518 --> 00:17:23,018
The child sustained an 80% burn.

443
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:26,118
Okay, so now this is starting
to sound a little suspicious.

444
00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:28,918
How many people are putting lit candles

445
00:17:29,018 --> 00:17:31,318
in and around their babies' cribs?

446
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:33,218
"Oh, I just put little Ethan to bed.

447
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:35,818
I put plenty of lit candles in
his crib as a nightlight,

448
00:17:35,918 --> 00:17:37,518
and I balanced several sharp knives

449
00:17:37,618 --> 00:17:39,918
and open cans of paint thinner
right on the crib walls

450
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,418
so he has something to look at."

451
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,818
But, look, Heimbach wasn't done.

452
00:17:43,918 --> 00:17:45,118
Because just a year later,

453
00:17:45,218 --> 00:17:47,918
he was testifying before
the State Legislature in Alaska,

454
00:17:48,018 --> 00:17:49,418
and guess what?

455
00:17:50,418 --> 00:17:55,918
A six-week-old baby that I
took care of earlier this year.

456
00:17:56,018 --> 00:17:57,318
Mother went away.

457
00:17:57,418 --> 00:17:59,218
There was a candle on the bureau.

458
00:17:59,318 --> 00:18:02,718
Somehow the dog knocked
the candle onto the crib

459
00:18:02,818 --> 00:18:08,318
and the little girl sustained a 75%
very devastating burn.

460
00:18:08,418 --> 00:18:11,218
Wait, so now there's a dog
involved all of a sudden?

461
00:18:11,318 --> 00:18:13,418
What kind of dog would
do such a thing?

462
00:18:13,518 --> 00:18:14,218
Wait a second.

463
00:18:14,318 --> 00:18:15,818
I know exactly what kind of dog.

464
00:18:15,918 --> 00:18:18,918
A gruff, needlessly italian dog
like Tony.

465
00:18:19,318 --> 00:18:20,118
Bad dog!

466
00:18:20,618 --> 00:18:21,418
Bad dog!

467
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:26,818
Now, as if sensing that
lawmakers there

468
00:18:26,918 --> 00:18:28,518
were questioning his motives,

469
00:18:28,618 --> 00:18:30,618
the very next sentence
that Heimbach said,

470
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:32,718
completely unprompted, was this.

471
00:18:33,118 --> 00:18:35,018
I am not in the pocket of anybody

472
00:18:35,118 --> 00:18:38,118
that makes a specific
flame retardant.

473
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:39,818
Now, to be fair,

474
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,118
he's actually right about that.

475
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:43,518
He was not in the pocket of someone

476
00:18:43,618 --> 00:18:45,918
that made a specific flame retardant.

477
00:18:46,018 --> 00:18:46,818
He was, however,

478
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,818
in the pocket of Citizens
for Fire Safety,

479
00:18:48,918 --> 00:18:51,218
who'd paid him $240,000 for his help,

480
00:18:51,318 --> 00:18:52,318
and who, it turned out,

481
00:18:52,418 --> 00:18:53,918
only had three members.

482
00:18:54,018 --> 00:18:57,618
Which were the three largest makers
of flame retardants in the world.

483
00:18:57,718 --> 00:18:58,718
So I call it:

484
00:18:58,818 --> 00:19:02,418
"Liar, liar, pants chemically incapable
of catching on fire."

485
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:04,518
And one more thing:

486
00:19:04,618 --> 00:19:05,518
when a reporter called

487
00:19:05,618 --> 00:19:06,818
the medical examiner's office,

488
00:19:06,918 --> 00:19:09,718
they had no record of any burn victim

489
00:19:09,818 --> 00:19:12,318
matching Heimbach's
description whatsoever.

490
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,518
So one of them did
the next logical thing.

491
00:19:15,318 --> 00:19:17,818
I thought the best thing to do
was just to call him at home.

492
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:19,618
I said, "those kids you talked about,

493
00:19:19,718 --> 00:19:22,718
did they all die in your hospital?"

494
00:19:22,918 --> 00:19:25,718
And he said, "it wasn't factual,

495
00:19:25,818 --> 00:19:27,218
it was anecdotal."

496
00:19:27,318 --> 00:19:29,318
And I said, "but that's not
what you testified."

497
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,018
And he said, "well,
I wasn't under oath."

498
00:19:31,418 --> 00:19:32,818
Okay, okay.

499
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:35,118
First of all, you're generally expected

500
00:19:35,218 --> 00:19:36,118
to tell the truth

501
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:37,918
even when you're not under oath.

502
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:39,018
And second of all,

503
00:19:39,118 --> 00:19:41,118
anecdotes aren't the same as lies.

504
00:19:41,218 --> 00:19:43,618
"I saw Keri Russell
walking out of a bakery."

505
00:19:43,718 --> 00:19:44,618
That's an anecdote.

506
00:19:44,718 --> 00:19:46,085
It's not a good anecdote,

507
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,185
but it is an anecdote.

508
00:19:47,285 --> 00:19:50,085
"I saw Keri Russell riding
a dragon out of a bakery."

509
00:19:50,185 --> 00:19:50,885
That is a lie.

510
00:19:50,985 --> 00:19:51,885
Although, admittedly,

511
00:19:51,985 --> 00:19:53,385
it would be
a way better story.

512
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:55,485
And, look,
the real problem there is,

513
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:56,985
Heimbach's lies worked.

514
00:19:57,085 --> 00:19:58,785
That flame-retardant bill in California

515
00:19:58,885 --> 00:19:59,985
initially failed,

516
00:20:00,085 --> 00:20:02,385
thanks in part to his testimony.

517
00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:03,685
And the final and perhaps

518
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,685
most controversial tool
in astroturfing

519
00:20:05,785 --> 00:20:07,985
relates to something
that our current president

520
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:09,685
actually loves to complain about.

521
00:20:09,785 --> 00:20:11,285
I'll tell you what,

522
00:20:11,385 --> 00:20:13,285
you take a look outside,

523
00:20:13,385 --> 00:20:15,385
these are paid protesters, folks.

524
00:20:15,485 --> 00:20:19,885
The protestors are paid a lot
of money by the DNC.

525
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,885
It turned out that
the protesters we used to have

526
00:20:22,985 --> 00:20:26,285
were bought for $1,500 a piece.

527
00:20:26,385 --> 00:20:27,485
We have a protester.

528
00:20:27,585 --> 00:20:31,985
By the way, were you paid
$1,500 to be a thug?

529
00:20:32,085 --> 00:20:35,085
Now, I can't work it
quite out there.

530
00:20:35,185 --> 00:20:36,485
Is trump angry there

531
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:39,585
or is he excited that he
stumbled on a job opportunity

532
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:42,285
that Don Jr. and Eric
would actually be qualify for?

533
00:20:42,385 --> 00:20:47,785
But while Trump's specific
accusations were nonsense,

534
00:20:47,885 --> 00:20:49,885
paid demonstrators do exist,

535
00:20:49,985 --> 00:20:51,885
which Trump should
frankly know himself,

536
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:53,985
because his campaign
reportedly hired actors

537
00:20:54,085 --> 00:20:56,285
who were paid $50 to cheer for him

538
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:57,785
at his campaign announcement.

539
00:20:57,885 --> 00:21:00,785
But paid demonstrators are one of the most

540
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,785
infuriating tools of astroturfing.

541
00:21:02,885 --> 00:21:05,285
Just look at what happened
last year in New Orleans.

542
00:21:05,385 --> 00:21:07,285
A company called Entergy

543
00:21:07,385 --> 00:21:08,785
needed city council approval

544
00:21:08,885 --> 00:21:10,585
for a controversial power plant,

545
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:13,685
which it got not long
after a public meeting,

546
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:15,185
where, by sheer chance,

547
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:19,285
a bunch of huge power plant fans
in orange shirts turned up.

548
00:21:19,385 --> 00:21:21,285
Now, it later emerged
that a PR firm

549
00:21:21,385 --> 00:21:22,285
working for Entergy

550
00:21:22,385 --> 00:21:23,685
hired a company called

551
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:24,985
"Crowds on Demand",

552
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:27,385
which recruited actors
to support the plant.

553
00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:28,885
They did this with a facebook ad,

554
00:21:28,985 --> 00:21:31,985
which offered, and I quote,
"60-200 dollarydoos

555
00:21:32,085 --> 00:21:35,085
to help with a gig for three hours."

556
00:21:35,185 --> 00:21:37,685
Which in itself, like there,
is a red flag.

557
00:21:37,785 --> 00:21:40,185
"Dollarydoos" sounds like slang for

558
00:21:40,285 --> 00:21:42,685
money that you'd find in
a Mark Twain novel called

559
00:21:42,785 --> 00:21:46,285
"Even for the 1800s, there are
way too many n-words in this."

560
00:21:46,385 --> 00:21:48,085
Now, Crowds on Demand

561
00:21:48,185 --> 00:21:50,385
even provided talking
points such as

562
00:21:50,485 --> 00:21:52,485
"Folks, this is 2017",

563
00:21:52,585 --> 00:21:55,199
"We had a boil water advisory
here last month",

564
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:56,799
and "I'm tired of feeling

565
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,699
like I live in
a third world country."

566
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,799
And it seems like
some of the people there

567
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:02,799
took those notes
and ran with them.

568
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:05,899
I'm tired of feeling like we're
living in a third world country.

569
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:07,799
This is the United States of America.

570
00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:11,799
It's 2017 going on 2018...

571
00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:13,999
And we have to worry

572
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,999
about these frequent
water boil advisories.

573
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:18,399
And so on and so forth.

574
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:21,299
I have to be concerned
that a grandmother,

575
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:23,899
or a son, or a pet

576
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,200
could possibly drink or take
in some brain-eating amoeba.

577
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,400
Yeah.

578
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,600
I'll give him credit
for that last bit.

579
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,600
The brain-eating amoeba bit
was all his own.

580
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,400
He was just riffing hard
at that point.

581
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,700
Now, that man insists that

582
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,400
he believed everything he said

583
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,700
and that he wasn't paid by
Crowds on Demand.

584
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,000
Although you should know
that another person there,

585
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,800
who does admit to being paid,

586
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,800
said he received instructions
that read,

587
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,400
"A few things to keep in mind:

588
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,300
One, tell nobody you're being paid.

589
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,200
Two, tell nobody you're being paid.

590
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,800
Three, media will be present.
Do not talk to them.

591
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,600
Four, tell nobody you're being paid.

592
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,600
and Five, if somebody approaches you,

593
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,300
don't tell them you're being paid."

594
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,300
Which are, and this is true,
word-for-word,

595
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
the vows in a traditional
scientology wedding.

596
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,000
Now, they're beautiful vows,
and you should go.

597
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,300
Now, if you're wondering
who's behind Crowds on Demand,

598
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,500
let me introduce you to their CEO,

599
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
Adam Swart,

600
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,500
the answer to the question,

601
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,500
"What if a lukewarm bottle
of smirnoff ice was a person?"

602
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,100
Now, he is,
he's pretty unrepentant

603
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,500
about what his firm does.

604
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,300
Have you ever provided
protestors for an event?

605
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,800
Of course.

606
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,100
Demonstrators?

607
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,800
Of course.

608
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,500
Do you see anything wrong with that?

609
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,700
Personally, no.

610
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
Do you ever feel like
you're tricking people

611
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,300
though into getting behind something
that they may have not gotten behind

612
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,200
if they didn't see
all this activity there?

613
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,000
We don't trick people.
We engage them.

614
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,500
Yeah.

615
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,300
Yeah, but you engage them

616
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,800
by tricking them, don't you?

617
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,400
Both of those things can be true
at the same time.

618
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,200
It's like someone saying,
"I'm not masturbating

619
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,600
in the middle of this pinkberry,

620
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,700
I'm just engaging
the police department."

621
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,100
You're actually doing both,

622
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,400
and one doesn't make
the other okay.

623
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,700
Now, of course,

624
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
Swart's whole ruse is

625
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,500
predicated on people
holding their nerve

626
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,100
and not giving the game
away in real time.

627
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,200
But amazingly, that has happened.

628
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,800
"In the small town of Camarillo...

629
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,300
I think the city needs a shake-up.

630
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,400
"... citizens aren't shy
about expressing their opinions."

631
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,800
"But one chilly wednesday
night in December...

632
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,000
Prince Jordan Tyson?

633
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,700
"... city officials say
this man stood out."

634
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,000
This case is clearly common sense.

635
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,400
"Because for three minutes,

636
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,600
he told the city council what
he later admits was a lie."

637
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,200
I'm just a concerned citizen

638
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,700
coming up here and speaking to you.

639
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,800
"But he's not."

640
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,100
"He's a self-described struggling
actor from Beverly Hills

641
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
who goes by the name of
Prince Jordan Tyson."

642
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,500
Okay, no.

643
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
I don't believe it.

644
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,600
I do not believe it.

645
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,100
Does anything about this face,

646
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,700
this face, say "struggling actor

647
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,000
from Beverly Hills" to you?

648
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,300
I'm sorry. This story just
doesn't check out.

649
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,900
But incredibly, it's true.

650
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,100
Because while the notorious P.J.T.

651
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,700
initially claimed to be from the area,

652
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,700
he soon had a crisis of confidence,

653
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
culminating in this.

654
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,400
"Forty minutes later,

655
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
Tyson came back to the podium..."

656
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,300
Prince is back.

657
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,900
"For one of the strangest moments

658
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,800
the city council has ever seen."

659
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,700
I don't agree with
the reason I'm here,

660
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,000
and I was paid to be here.

661
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,300
How much were you paid?

662
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,400
Hundred bucks.

663
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,400
How much?

664
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,300
$100.

665
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,000
You fucking idiot, Prince!

666
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,500
You just broke Crowds
on Demand rules 1, 2, 4, and 5!

667
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,200
Now you won't get
those hundred dollarydoos,

668
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,200
which could have gone toward
changing your name

669
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,500
to literally anything else

670
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,900
or getting a haircut that
doesn't make you look like

671
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,400
an al dente Owen Wilson.

672
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,400
Look, when you add
all of this together

673
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,400
fake groups hiring fake experts

674
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,700
and fake crowds which
manage to effect

675
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,200
real-world change,
it gets pretty dispiriting,

676
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,000
and it can do real damage

677
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,100
that goes beyond the narrow issues

678
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,000
that each group is trying to influence.

679
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,600
The very existence of companies
like Crowds on Demand,

680
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,100
means that something authentic
can now be tainted.

681
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
In fact, conspiracy boards

682
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,100
now regularly and wrongly

683
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,200
cite Crowds on Demand
as providing everything

684
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,000
from paid protestors
for Charlottesville

685
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,000
to crisis actors for
the Las Vegas shooting.

686
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,400
And that is hugely dangerous,

687
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,300
because the consequence of this

688
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,400
cannot be that everyone assumes

689
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,400
that anyone who doesn't agree
with them is astroturf.

690
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,500
While skepticism is healthy,

691
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,400
cynicism, real cynicism, is toxic,

692
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,800
and because this problem
isn't going away,

693
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,800
it is now even more
incumbent on us

694
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,700
to use our judgment diligently.

695
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,800
If the Ray Liotta of dogs
is telling us

696
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,700
the Humane Society is terrible,

697
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,000
it's probably worth us
all asking, why?

698
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:39,900
Why?

699
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,200
Who might have trained him?

700
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,100
And what do they stand to gain?

701
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,000
And unfortunately, until
we find out a way

702
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,500
to force astroturf groups

703
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,700
to be more transparent
and accountable,

704
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,000
that's about all we
can do right now.

705
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,700
Astroturfing is a serious threat
to our public discourse,

706
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,200
and it is critical that we're
all more aware of its dangers.

707
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,300
And since astroturfers have left
all their tools lying around,

708
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,000
at the very least, we might as well

709
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,000
use them to fight candle fire
with candle fire

710
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,500
and deliver a heartfelt message.

711
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,400
We are all americans.

712
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,200
Real people.

713
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,700
Definitely not actors.

714
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,700
We're just a coalition
of concerned doctors,

715
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,900
mothers, teachers, and kidnappers,

716
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,500
and we think you deserve
the truth about astroturfers.

717
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,900
Here are the facts.

718
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,600
Astroturfers are responsible for

719
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,700
every shark attack
in american history.

720
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,300
Wonder where all
the bees have gone?

721
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,700
Astroturfers shot them in the face.

722
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,600
And according to the Bipartisan Institute

723
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,100
of Factual Science Studies,

724
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,900
every single astroturfer
has killed at least one puppy

725
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,300
with their bare hands.

726
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,700
Or maybe not.

727
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,000
We're not under oath.

728
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,500
The point is, astroturfers
set this baby on fire.

729
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,700
That's not a dog.

730
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,800
That's a real baby, no bigger
than an italian greyhound.

731
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,700
Her name is Eleanor,
and she likes four things:

732
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,700
her binkie, her baba, corporate
and political transparency,

733
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,500
and not being on fire.

734
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,100
And right now, Eleanor is 0 for 4.

735
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,400
And if you're not careful,

736
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,000
one day an astroturfer
is going to come your house

737
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,300
and light your baby on fire.

738
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,400
Stop astroturfing.

739
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,700
Paid for by Citizens
for Fresher Orange Juice.

740
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,400
That's our show.

741
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,200
Thanks so much for watching.
See you next week.

742
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,000
Good night!
