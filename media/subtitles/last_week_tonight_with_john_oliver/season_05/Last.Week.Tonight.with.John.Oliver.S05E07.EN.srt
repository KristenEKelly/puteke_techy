LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,600
SEASON V
EPISODE 7

3
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,760
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !
I'm John Oliver !

4
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,600
Thank you so much for joining us !
Time for a quick recap of the week.

5
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,600
We begin with Trump administration,
where over 70 percent of Americans

6
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,200
have now served at least two months
in a cabinet level position.

7
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,520
I was the Secretary of Labor
between January and February,

8
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,520
and it did not go well.

9
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,600
This week saw another
cabinet member in serious trouble,

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,000
with EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt
facing questions

11
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,960
about ethics violations
and questionable spending.

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,520
He spent 832 000 dollars in the first
quarter of his term on security costs,

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,760
he's been accused of wasteful spending
on first class and private flights,

14
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,240
installing a soundproof phone booth
for 43 000 dollars.

15
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,200
One Democrat demanding answers
on why Pruitt requested security 24/7,

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,080
including allegedly on personal trips
to Disneyland an the Rose Bowl.

17
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,560
I'm a little torn. On one hand
that does seem wasteful.

18
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,240
On the other, if anyone needs security
at Disneyland it's Scott Pruitt.

19
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,560
A man who even
Mickey and Minnie Mouse

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,640
would tell to go fuck himself !

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,760
You son of a bitch !
Get him, Minnie, get him !

22
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,680
This is a pretty sudden
fall from grace for Pruitt,

23
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,880
who's been a Conservative favorite for
his aggressively pro industry stance,

24
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,920
so aggressive that even though
he's in charge of the EPA,

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,960
his LinkedIn page still lists him

26
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,840
as a leading advocate
against the EPA's activist agenda.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,680
Pruitt appeared on Fox News
but seems completely unprepared.

28
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,120
It had already emerged
that he had bypassed the White House

29
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,200
to give big raises to 2 of his favorite
aids, and this was his response !

30
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,240
Why did yo go around the president
to give pay raises to two staffers ?

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,440
My staff did and I found out
about that and I changed it.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,720
- It should not have been done.
- Who did it ?

33
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,680
A career person
or a political person ?

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,640
- I don't know.
- You don't know who did it ?!

35
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,120
I found out about it yesterday
and I corrected the action.

36
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,680
Okay ! First that is clearly

37
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,680
not the Fox News tone
that Pruitt was expecting.

38
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,600
It's the face of a man who thought
he was walking into an Applebee's

39
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,720
and ended up
în an apple full of bees.

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,560
What is this ?
Why is this happening to me ? Why ?

41
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,520
Things got even worse because
Puitt also took flak for the fact

42
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,000
that when he first moved to DC
he paid just 50 dollars a night

43
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,120
to stay in a condo linked
to a prominent energy lobbyst,

44
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,040
which for the whole
drain the swamp administration

45
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,760
is particulary hard to take,
and this pushback was pathetic.

46
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,200
That is something that again has
been reviewd by the ethics official.

47
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,320
Ranking it
from the wife of lobbyist !

48
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,880
You could go on Craigslist...

49
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,720
The Craigslist today
shows rentals for one bedroom

50
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,160
of less that 1 000 dollars,
on Capitol Hill or near.

51
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,440
Never heard.
I've lived în Washington over 25 years.

52
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,160
Now... I know that 50 dollars a night
sounds ridiculous,

53
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,000
but to be fair to him,
we checked Airbnb

54
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,920
and it turns out you cam find places
for 50 dollars a night in DC.

55
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,840
This place, with an intriguing photo
of what your room will look like,

56
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,600
and a second intriguing photo

57
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,120
showing you what the room looks like
with the lights turned on.

58
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,120
Also that is this place
which seems to be a bed

59
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,400
wedged between the door to the room
and the front door,

60
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,960
and which for the record
is listed on the site

61
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,440
as a "glistening
private berdroom and bar"

62
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,520
which begs the question:
"Why is it glistening though ?"

63
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,560
And finally there is this one
for just 30 dollars a night,

64
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,800
where the add is literally named:
"A leather couch named Black Beauty".

65
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,200
30 dollars
to stay on someone's couch,

66
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,800
but I have a strict rule
where I do not stay

67
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,840
at the apartment of anyone
who names their furniture.

68
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,360
You've met Black Beauty,
this is our fridge coolio,

69
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,160
vacuum sucks a lot
and our tufted ottoman Melanie.

70
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,880
She really looked like a Melanie.

71
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,800
The best sign that Pruitt knew he was
getting a suspiciously favorable deal

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,560
is how loath he was to give it up,
because his lease was reportedly

73
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,680
just through April 1st of last year, but
several month later he was still there.

74
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,160
Politico reports Pruitt
overstayed his welcome.

75
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,440
Landlords was so frustrated
with their lingering tenant,

76
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,280
that they pushed him out
and changed their locks.

77
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,520
That is unfortunate
but it's Black Beauty time, baby !

78
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,520
Go get some of that pseudo-public
unwashed leather,

79
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,920
and go make it glisten,
make it shine !

80
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,440
But this story gets even weirder,
because taxpayers wound up

81
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,640
paying 2 400 dollars
to repair a door at the apartments

82
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,400
damaged for the dumbest
possible reason.

83
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,320
ABC News has learned of this bizarre
incident at the apartment last year.

84
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,240
I need an ambulance please.

85
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,680
Am urgent 911 call.

86
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,720
They say he's unconscious
and he's unresponsive.

87
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,840
Pruitt's protective detail
breaking down the door.

88
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,640
Inside, the cabinet secretary,
unresponsive.

89
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,360
Respond to unconscious person.

90
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,880
The EPA
is not commenting on the incident,

91
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,400
but sources tell us
Pruitt was just napping.

92
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,440
He was napping ! Napping !

93
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,800
It's not the most important detail. The
day that happened was Wednesday,

94
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,960
so on top of everything else,
the director of the EPA

95
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,280
was sitting at home,
taking a nap in the middle of the day.

96
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,680
On a Wednesdy ! Get the fuck up !
You got a country to ruin !

97
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,880
And yet, amazingly, as of this taping
Pruitt somehow still has a job,

98
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,520
with the president saying:

99
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,160
"He's done a fantastic job at EPA.
I think he'll be fine."

100
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,960
Who knows why he thinks that.
Maybe because Pruitt is doing

101
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,400
what Trump wanted him to do,
dismantling the EPA

102
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,920
or maybe Trump knows that if you
want to get rid of Scott Pruitt

103
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,120
you have to kick his door down,
wake him from a nap,

104
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,200
drag him out and eventually
change the fucking locks.

105
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,320
So let's move on to Hungary,

106
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,320
located between the beautiful
East Eurpean nations

107
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,880
of "Don't care never will",
and "I get it I'm bad at geography".

108
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,120
Hungary had a Parlamentary election.

109
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,760
The results won't be out for weeks,
but there is a clear favorite.

110
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,520
Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban
is said to secure his 4th term

111
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,040
and critics say the country's
democracy is on the line.

112
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,800
His ruling coalition has passed laws
targeting independent media,

113
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,920
and his party has campaigned heavily
against immigrants.

114
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,320
Yes, it looks like Hungary
is getting more Viktor Orban.

115
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,360
the right-wing populist
and henchman number 3

116
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,960
in a video-on-demand
Steven Seagal movie.

117
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,920
Orban is a deeply unpleasant leader,
virulently anti-immigrant,

118
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,920
and with more than a whiff
of the strongman about him.

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,040
Calling him a dictator wouldn't be
a huge exageration.

120
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,600
Calling him a dictator to his face
would be absolutely amazing,

121
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,440
and incredibly that happened.

122
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,480
Watch EU Commission President
Jean-Claude Juncker

123
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,120
greet him a few years back.

124
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,000
The dictator is coming.

125
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,400
Dictator !

126
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,120
Juncker just looked a man
right into the eyes,

127
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,600
called him a dictator, slapped him
in the face and got away with it.

128
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,480
My man from Luxembourg
don't give a fuck.

129
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,400
And although Orban seems to have
this election locked up,

130
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,560
he did face some competition
from a party called Yobbik,

131
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,440
a party which until very recently
was actually to the right of Orban.

132
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,640
How far to the right ? Yobbik is
a historically anti-semitic party.

133
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,080
As recently as 2014,

134
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,000
a Yobbik official reffered
to the Holocaust as a "holoscam".

135
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,440
Yet amazingly some on the left
have supported Yobbik,

136
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,120
out of sheer spite for Orban

137
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,280
with the socialist candidate even
declaring that he's work them saying:

138
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,600
"We have to cooperate with everyone,
even with the devil."

139
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,880
Whick is a weird way to put that,

140
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,280
because even in th Bible
there is no one worse that the devil.

141
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,000
Exept of course for Cookie,

142
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,000
the panda bear who got diarrhea
all over Noah's Arc.

143
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,320
But truly fascinang part
of Hungary's elections

144
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,080
is the fact that public money
is made available for their elections

145
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,560
with the state offering cash
per every candidate put forward.

146
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,280
That's a nice idea, but it has led
to a flood of fake parties

147
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,320
that frequently emerge,
absorb the money and dissapear.

148
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,440
Some of them don't seem
to put in much effort.

149
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,040
Among the parties submitted

150
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,800
were the "Party for the Poor",
"Party for all the Poor",

151
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,720
"Hungarian Party of Poor People",

152
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,760
and "Hungarian Party
of People Who Want to Do",

153
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,240
which sounds less
like a political party,

154
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,640
more like a no-nonsense
Hungarian orgy.

155
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,960
We did not come to party
for shrimp cocktail.

156
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,680
We're Hungarian people
who want to do !

157
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,200
Let's do right now,
right here, at "to do" party !

158
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,880
Let's do !

159
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,920
So to recap in Hungary
there are real parties, fake parties,

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,120
and there's also a third cathegory
that falls between them, joke parties,

161
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,160
like the Two-tailed Dog party,

162
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,880
who've made promises including:
eternal life, two sunsets a day,

163
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,640
a network of express buses
which stop nowhere,

164
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,880
and flooding the streets with beer
on holidays to combat traffic problems.

165
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,920
If you are interested
in what their candidates look like,

166
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,840
I'll give you a truly incredible
interview on Hungarian Television.

167
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,800
The next candidate
to present their program

168
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,160
is the Hungarian
Two-tailed Dog Party.

169
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,440
Our guest is Jozsef Tichy-Racs
fron Two-tailed Dog Party,

170
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,680
nominated candidate
and spokesman.

171
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,040
Okay, first of all, the sounds
that chicken made is not...

172
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,560
So I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say that is not a real chicken.

173
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,480
But that chicken man's appearance
actually only happened

174
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,560
because that Hungarian TV channel
promised to give 5 minutes of airtime

175
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,920
to every party.

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,120
And you have to hand it
to that chicken,

177
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,000
because he used his time wisely
by reading a pre-prepared statement.

178
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,440
I didn't want to interrupt,
but we only have 23 seconds left.

179
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,200
Do you ? How on Earth is he going
to use those remaining seconds ?

180
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,560
He might touch on...

181
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,560
I absolutely love that chicken
and not just because I identify

182
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,320
with peaky Europeann
in rectangular black rimmed glasses.

183
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,360
But because...
You're laughing to hard at that...

184
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,080
If Hungary's choice

185
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,400
was between an incumbent
threatening its very democracy

186
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,840
and a party trying to pivot away
from its anti-semitic past,

187
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,040
you cam make a pretty good case
that "coc-coc-kadesh"

188
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,160
might not actually have been
their stupidest option.

189
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,280
And now this !

190
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,320
And now, coming up
on "The Doctors" !

191
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,320
- Stress is bad but did you know...
- It's shrinking our brains !

192
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,760
Not to worry,
the docs can stop the shrink !

193
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,840
Then... Cannabis for kids ?!
The doctors debate !

194
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,440
Why police weren't horsing around
with this woman accused of DUI.

195
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,840
That's a real thing !

196
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,560
Plus a trip to Paradise
takes a terryfing turn

197
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,480
as a man's testicle explode !

198
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,440
Plus one of the most embarassing
medical confessionals we've ever seen.

199
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,120
I have dingleberries.

200
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,480
Dr. Abs helps us tackle !
Top trending health gadgets !

201
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,360
Then, the RefrigerDater returns !
Plus, farting to avoid flirting !

202
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,800
The doctors are getting personal,
starting with your poop !

203
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,000
- You ready ?
- Yes !

204
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,240
Than that poop will !

205
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,160
Plus, the medical emergency
that had a woman...

206
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,880
... vomiting her own feces.

207
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's coming up !

208
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,720
Moving on !

209
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,600
Our main story tonight
concerns pornography.

210
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,560
Some believe it should be
available and accesible,

211
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,400
others think "It's not for me,
"but it's fine for other people",

212
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,800
and a few people think
it should be banned.

213
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,480
Did I say pornography ?
Sorry, I meant abortion.

214
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,320
Our main story tonight
is abortion.

215
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Yes, we have talked
about it before.

216
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,400
We looked at the way
abortion laws in America

217
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,840
have made access
to abortion difficult,

218
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,680
as clinics all over the country
have shut down,

219
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,680
but tonight we're gonna focus
on the opposite of an abortion clinic.

220
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,440
Something called
a Crisis Pregnancy Center,

221
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,080
facilities whose purpose

222
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,720
is to talk women
out of terminating a pregnancy.

223
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,080
Something
they don't make that clear.

224
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,520
Instead, running
friendly looking ads !

225
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,680
Before you make the decision

226
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,200
about a pregnancy that comes
at a last-than-perfect time,

227
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,600
get jelly on the belly,
come to Sunrise Woman's Clinic.

228
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,680
Okay. Jelly on the belly
is a pretty childish way

229
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,400
to describe
an important medical procedure.

230
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,720
I'm not sure
that I would trust a doctor

231
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,560
that refer colonoscopies as
"looking for cooties in the booties".

232
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,160
Second, one of the early pregnancy
options that you won't get a Sunrise

233
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,600
is an abortion,
but that can be hard to tell

234
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,520
from their vague name and marketing
and that happens a lot wits cps's.

235
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,640
Take the Center for Pregnancy
Choices in Mississippi.

236
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,480
It sounds like a welcoming place.
The website even has links

237
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,840
labeled "Thinkind Abortion ?"
and "Thinking Parenting ?"

238
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,160
and it was founded by a woman named
Barbara Beavers,

239
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,560
whose very name sounds like that
of a sassy mother in a TV show

240
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,200
about a family of beavers.

241
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,280
It would be called "Hot Dam"
and it would be absolutely delightful.

242
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,560
But once that you are inside her CPC
you will find that it's vehemently

243
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,160
against any choice that is not
carrying a pregnancy to term.

244
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,600
Just listen to Barbara explain
where she stands on abortion.

245
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,320
You're deceiving yourself
if you say you can kill your baby

246
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,920
and it's be good for you.

247
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,640
That's just deception.
That's not true.

248
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,400
It doesn't register with reality.
Mamas, women are not made that way.

249
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:12,200
They are made to protect in the garden,
to die for their babies !

250
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,440
Not their babies to die for them.

251
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,120
Holy shit ! Let me be
perfectly clear, Barbara !

252
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,560
The only females made to die
for their babies are Pacific salmon.

253
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,840
They lay thousands of eggs
and the die after spawning.

254
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,800
You're welcome, tune in next week,
for more Johnny O's Fish Facts,

255
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,760
Wildlife Wonders,
and Abortion.

256
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,840
Centers like that one
are proliferating.

257
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
There are now 2 700
pregnancy centers in America,

258
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,640
compared to less than
1 700 abortion providers

259
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,640
and the discrepancy is even worse
in certain states.

260
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,480
Mississippi for example
has one abortion clinic

261
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,240
and 38 crisis pregnancy centers.

262
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,520
So if they are that prevalent, people
should absolutely know what they are.

263
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,400
If you believe abortion is immoral,
you are allowed to set up

264
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,200
a center dedicating
to convincing women of that.

265
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,400
But what is happening with cps's
is that way too often

266
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,120
women with unplanned pregnancies
are being actively misled

267
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
while trying to access healthcare.

268
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,000
And cpc's seem happy to have
confuse them for abortion clinics.

269
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,160
Just listen to Abby Johnson,
an anti-abortion activist

270
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,920
adressing a conference for one
of the largest CPC organizations.

271
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,200
We want to appear neutral
on the outside.

272
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,800
The best client you ever get

273
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,760
is one that thinks they're walking
into an abortion clinic, okay ?

274
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,800
Those are the best clients
that could walk in your door

275
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,080
or call you center.

276
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,560
The ones that think
you provide abortions.

277
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,760
Normally the strategy
"pretend you're an abortion clinic"

278
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,120
is not actually
a great marketing stunt,

279
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,400
although I am pretty sure
that RadioShack would have tried that.

280
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,880
Sorry, we don't actually
perform abortions here,

281
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:00,120
but can I interest you in a gently
used USB cord or a Microsoft Zune.

282
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,440
They come in brown !

283
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,280
The efforts to conceal their
true intent takes many forms.

284
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,400
Starting with the name. Many CPC's
have the word "choice" in their names.

285
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,320
Like "Choices Women Center",
"Informed Choices Medical"

286
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,880
and all these other CPC's, which
features "choice" in their name.

287
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,440
Almost every product does a bit
of misleading advertising.

288
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,200
No one would buy Pepsi if they
were honest and called it "Sad Coke".

289
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,160
You wouldn't buy a Mini Cooper
if they admitted they were just

290
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,960
clown cars for regular people.

291
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,640
It should be easy to clarify
any misconceptions with a phone call,

292
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,160
that can be difficult.

293
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,000
Listen to what happens when one
woman called a CPC for information

294
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:51,000
and keep in mind that the center
never provides abortions.

295
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,440
The White Rose,
may I help you ?

296
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,280
I was wondering how much you charge
for a first trimester abortion ?

297
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,840
I really can't.
It's not, excuse me.

298
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,400
It's our policy, that we just like
the people to come in

299
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,040
and we can discuss then
and go forward.

300
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,400
CPC's can lure women to meet
with them on false pretenses.

301
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,320
They are catfishing them,
because catfish are constantly trying

302
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,360
to get women who are out of their
league to fuck them.

303
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,720
You thought we were out
of fish facts, you were wrong,

304
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,360
we have millions,
I can do this all day.

305
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,800
I'm not going to,
because we're talking about abortion.

306
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,920
CPC's can even intercept
people's internet searches

307
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,920
and routinely by google keyword ads
for phrases like abortion

308
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,800
and abortion clinic and frequently
try and phisically intercept people.

309
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,440
They often locate themselves as
close as possible to abortion clinics.

310
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,920
One provider in Hartford ran into
problems with a similarly named CPC

311
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,200
when they deliberately located
just 20 feet from them.

312
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,680
This woman speaks candidly about
the decision she had to make

313
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,920
after becoming pregnant
after a rape.

314
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,640
I didn't want the baby.
It was a lot on my soul.

315
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,320
She decided to seek the services
of the Hartford GYN.

316
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,000
She went for counseling

317
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,080
and the clinic's neighbour
"Hartford Women's Health"

318
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,720
tried to offer
unsolicited counsel as well.

319
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,200
They tried to tuck me over there.
I said: "You making me feel bad."

320
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,560
That's absolutely horrible.
Incidents like that was so routine,

321
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,040
the abortion clinic, to keep clients
from going to the wrong place,

322
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,880
painted the ramp outside
bright yellow, like The Wizard of Oz.

323
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:49,080
That movie too involves a young woman
getting stopped by idiots bothering her

324
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,600
and she just tries to get
where she needs to go.

325
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,320
When CPC's can't get a physical
location next to an abortion clinic,

326
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,680
they have another trick up their
sleeve and that is buses,

327
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,880
that can park outside
and try and tempt women in.

328
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,840
Many CPC's operate mobile clinics
with the help of organizations

329
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,240
like "Save the Storks", a name which
should immediately set off red flags.

330
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,200
Let me go into this van and talk
to someone who thinks

331
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,080
babies are brought by a deformed
pigeon on stilts.

332
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,040
To listen to them tell it, their vans
are an absolute joy to be inside.

333
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,920
These vehicles fit in one spot,
at the door of an abortion clinic.

334
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,600
They have a bathroom on it, to be
able to do a pregnancy test,

335
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,560
built-in refrigerator, the seats
are leather, this massage chair,

336
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,560
is really good for the back.

337
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,160
We've had good reviews from pregnant
women on the massage chair.

338
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,960
If someone wanted to spend their time
in the back of a plush van

339
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,320
and then be told not to have
an abortion,

340
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,720
they'd just fuck
the lead singer of Creed.

341
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,320
Once CPC's have women inside
their building or van,

342
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,400
they can employ every tactic to try
and get them to change their mind.

343
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,760
Every tactic in the book.
Heartbeat International,

344
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,120
which has 1 400 affiliates in US,
has this handbook,

345
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,200
with suggested scripts featuring
some nonsense information.

346
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,200
It suggests telling pregnant women
that 35% of suicidal behaviour

347
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,440
may be attributable to abortion,
which is bullshit.

348
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,920
It also says that abortion almost
doubles the risk of breast cancer,

349
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,720
which is also bullshit.

350
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,680
While abortion is far less medically
dangerous than carrying a child to term

351
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,640
that hasn't stopped CPC employees
from saying things like this...

352
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,480
If people die due to an abortion
later on,

353
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,680
a lot of times they're finding parts
of the fetus in the lungs or heart.

354
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,160
That happens a lot of times,
doesn't it ?

355
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,040
You're often looking
in the obituaries and see:

356
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,920
Sarah Mitchell passed away at age 34
after she got baby dicks in the heart.

357
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,840
It happens all the time.
We're tired of reading it.

358
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,720
That medical advice
can actually look pretty legitimate.

359
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,360
CPC's often have the trappings
of a health care facility.

360
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,160
They offer free ultrasounds,
which can sound appealing, it's free.

361
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,280
They're not performing them
so much for medical reasons,

362
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,200
as for emotional manipulation.

363
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,680
Watch this Christian Broadcasting
Network profile of women

364
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,480
who give free ultrasounds in this bus
outside abortion clinics.

365
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,360
They describe
their technique.

366
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,840
They usually start crying as we begin
and cover their eyes,

367
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:46,760
start peeking out between their fingers
and we call that a baby, and them mom,

368
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,840
youur baby's sucking his thumb
or he has the hiccups.

369
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,520
She and all who operate
the ultrasound machine

370
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,760
will spend as much time as needed
with the new moms.

371
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,960
She stays on that table
until she decides she wants the baby.

372
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,840
If that isn't coercive enough,

373
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:09,520
technicians at other clinics
have written messages,

374
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,160
like "Hi, mommy and daddy".

375
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,760
If you're gonna write
an unrequested ultrasound message,

376
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,640
at least be creative about it !

377
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,880
"I'm totally pooping in here"
or "I ate my twin"

378
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,560
or "Please don't put this on Facebook,
everyone hates that".

379
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:33,280
Finally, CPC's can and have misled
women about how pregnant they are

380
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,680
or have delayed their decision
past the point where it's possible.

381
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,360
Watch as one doctor describes a case
of a woman who came to her

382
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,040
in the third trimester, having been
under the care of a CPC

383
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,000
that gave her terrible advice.

384
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,720
They told her she didn't have to worry
or to rush, no time issue,

385
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:58,520
they do abortion in New York
up until term, which is ridiculous.

386
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,360
When she came to me,
she was too pregnant,

387
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,200
her partner had abandoned her,
she had no money,

388
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,440
she had three other children,
no intention of being pregnant,

389
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,280
during the pregnancy she had been
using drugs and alcohol.

390
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,720
She went to end the pregnancy and
I had to tell her: you'll have a baby.

391
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:27,320
That is heartbreaking. For all
the lenghts that CPC's will go to,

392
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:33,680
many don't do a key thing and that's
give women access to birth control.

393
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,720
That script from before instructs CPC's
to tell people:

394
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,160
"condoms are ineffective
in preventing pregnancy".

395
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,680
Some operators, like Barbara Beavers,
are hard skeptics.

396
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,280
Condoms, they don't prevent,
even used correctly.

397
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,680
There's like a 20% failure rate,
even used correctly.

398
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,080
There's a relatively
high failure rate of condoms.

399
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,040
I thought, if it's used correctly,
it's a 98% rate of success.

400
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,640
I don't believe that.
I don't think that's correct.

401
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,080
I would question it,
so I'll find some of our data.

402
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,600
Why are you laughing, Barbara ?
Is it because, deep down,

403
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:23,000
even you know that your data
is complete horseshit ?

404
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,120
If you want fewer abortions,
you should love birth control.

405
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,960
You should be filling Pez dispensers
with birth control pills.

406
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,960
You should give condoms out
to trick-or-treaters

407
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,800
and IUD earrings out
as hostess gifts.

408
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,800
Birth control should be
you favorite thing in the whole world.

409
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,680
Many of these CPC's are about more
than just abortions.

410
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,760
They're about controlling
women's sexual behaviour.

411
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,960
Many are church-affiliated, like
the Pregnancy Care Center, in Florida,

412
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,080
started by a Catholic priest,
father Thomas Euteneuer.

413
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,560
I don't wanna say he had
a condescending view of women,

414
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,000
watch him describe the lenghts
he would go to to lure them away

415
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,040
from entering an abortion clinic.

416
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,560
I remember when they had
the fence up in front of the place.

417
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:18,280
I decided I would talk to women
over the fence, on top of the ladder,

418
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,760
and talking to them...

419
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,560
That generated a 911 call,

420
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,920
because
I was now talking down to women.

421
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,440
I was both literally and figuratively
talking down to them.

422
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:43,760
I made it clear they were merely
vessels for giving birth...

423
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,400
I don't actually even see them
as full humans.

424
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:52,160
That's why what I do is funny.
I'm a chuckle monster.

425
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,800
That's priceless !

426
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,800
Quick side notes
about that particular priest.

427
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,000
He admitted
to violating the boundaries of chastity

428
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,320
with a woman who accused him of
molesting her for two years,

429
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,720
during what was supposed
to be an exorcism

430
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,800
and some of the details
in the allegations are insane.

431
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,680
He kissed the corners of her mouth,
stroked her legs, breasts and thighs,

432
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,200
caressed her face,
laid his body on top of hers

433
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:25,240
and explained full passionate kisses
as blowing the Holy Spirit into her.

434
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,560
Let's be clear ! If you're doing
anything that can be described

435
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,040
as blowing
the Holy Spirit into someone,

436
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,560
you are very much
doing kissing wrong.

437
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,800
Unless your idea of exorcism
is making the woman burp a lot,

438
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,400
you're also doing exorcisms
wrong as well.

439
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,240
It could be why
it took you two years.

440
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:51,360
You might be wondering how
you can give women ultrasounds

441
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,960
and inaccurate medical information
and not break the law.

442
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,720
CPC's are careful to stop
just short of the line,

443
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,800
where they will be regulated
as health care providers.

444
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,080
This offers them
numerous advantages.

445
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,160
They're not subject to HIPAA,
a federal law requiring

446
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,920
that patients informations
be kept private, not ideal

447
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,520
in a setting where such sensitive
information is being shared.

448
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,240
If you're not already
angry enough,

449
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,520
the government actually funds
CPC's, you are paying for them.

450
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,200
They can get federal funding
and 16 states use taxpayer money

451
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,720
to fund them directly.

452
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:36,480
They will say that their beliefs
can justify the methods you've seen.

453
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,920
They might point to the assistance
that some centers provide to mothers,

454
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,240
like parenting classes and free
diapers, which is great,

455
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,600
if those women want to be mothers.

456
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,360
As Abby Johnson advised CPC
operators in that conference,

457
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,360
that help
can be surprisingly limited.

458
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,800
If I were to open a pregnancy center,

459
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,000
I would not have pregnancy items
past six months.

460
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,000
Are we running a charity ?
Are we running a place

461
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,960
where we want women
do become self-sufficient ?

462
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,320
Have maternity clothes, things
available while they're pregnant,

463
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,640
but cut them off !

464
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:21,240
So we're just not in a position where
we can take care of a baby forever,

465
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,760
we don't have the time
or the resources,

466
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,680
so we're choosing not to make
that commitment now,

467
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,520
to which I would say:
yeah, exactly.

468
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,640
The real point here is...

469
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,200
The tactics that CPC's often use
are disingenuous and predatory

470
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:45,480
and it's critical that people
understand that, but they don't.

471
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,160
Watch how one local news outlet
covered the opening of a CPC

472
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,520
in the gigantic Care Net network.

473
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,680
Schuylkill County is the only
county in our area

474
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,040
that does not have
a Planned Parenthood,

475
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,480
but that doesn't mean teens
don't have a place to go for help.

476
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,960
Karen expanded to two facilities,
one for parents

477
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,920
and one for expecting mothers
under the age of 21.

478
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:13,600
Don't say that ! If you want
all the options available to you,

479
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,800
those two
are not remotely the same.

480
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,400
Like saying our town doesn't have
a youth sports league,

481
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,720
but we do have a large scary man
who will chase your kids around.

482
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,240
He too operates
out of a van.

483
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,000
People need to understand this
because now it's too easy

484
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,320
for a religious organization
to disguise its true nature,

485
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,240
establish a CPC and provide women
with poor information

486
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,080
about one of their most
important health choices.

487
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,600
I can prove how easy it is.
Back in season two,

488
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,360
I established the Church
Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption,

489
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,400
with my lovely wife
Wanda Jo Oliver.

490
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,680
Last week we filed paperwork in NY
to create a new nonprofit,

491
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,360
Our Lady of Choosing Choice, to set up
our own crisis pregnancy center.

492
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,800
Where will our clinic be ?
Depends. Where are you now ?

493
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,360
Our clinic has wheels
and we will travel...

494
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:18,360
Behold our new mobile CPC !

495
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,280
Look at it !
Behold the roaring thunder !

496
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:33,520
There is no way
that I would open this alone !

497
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,920
Howdy there !

498
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,720
Howdy there, my Wanda Jo !

499
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,600
Praised be and welcome
to Vanned Parenthood !

500
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,920
Thank you so much. In this van
we are allowed to tell women

501
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,960
whatever dubious information
comes into our heads.

502
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,760
That's right, my John !
I tell women, if they get an abortion,

503
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,880
it'll make a ghost baby
that'll haunt them forever.

504
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,680
Spooky !
What else do you say, Wanda ?

505
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,480
Getting an abortion turns
your breast milk into "kombucha".

506
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,040
- That is weird.
- It is.

507
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,200
One more fact,
for the people at home.

508
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,000
After an abortion, your vagina
seals shut like en egyptian tomb.

509
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,720
A striking image ! These are all
things that we could say.

510
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:31,120
I'm not legally required in NY
to use this ultrasound machine.

511
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,560
That's terryfing. In that case,
let's get some jelly on some belly.

512
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:43,320
Let's do it. I got grapes, raspberry
and some gummy bears.

513
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,640
- Praised be !
- What's going on over here ?

514
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,800
There's the baby, right there.
You're pregnant.

515
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,400
- It's a miracle !
- I'm with child.

516
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,840
I gotta ask you a tricky question.
How do you feel about birth control ?

517
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,840
I do give out condoms, but I tell
people they're zero percent effective.

518
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:12,360
- How's that possible...
- Because I cut these suckers.

519
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,800
To blow the Holy Spirit
right on through !

520
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:21,560
Just like our church,
we are tax exempt

521
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,400
and we could be eligible
for government funding.

522
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,200
- Praise discretionary budgets !
- Praise the pregnancy tests !

523
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,040
Praise privacy law loopholes !

524
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:35,200
Praise women who are too emotional
to take decisions for their bodies.

525
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,320
Wanda Jo, don't cry !

526
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:43,120
This is all perfectly legal and
there is nothing stopping us

527
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,280
from parking outside an abortion
clinic tonight and haranguing people,

528
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,640
and frankly
they're really fucking should be.

529
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,160
That is our show. See you next week.
Goodnight !

530
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,640
Shall we enter ?

531
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,920
Would you give me a wanding ?

532
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,600
Beautiful !

533
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,160
- Praised be !
- It's a miracle.

534
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,280
It's a special miracle.
And it's all allowed.

535
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,120
All of this is allowed.

536
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,200
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

537
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,440
