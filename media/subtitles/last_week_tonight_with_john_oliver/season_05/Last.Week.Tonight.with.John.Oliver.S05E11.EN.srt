00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,160
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,080
SEASON V
EPISODE 11

3
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:36,090
Welcome to Last Week Tonight !
I'm John Oliver.

4
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,100
Thank you so much for joining us.
You might be thinking right now,

5
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,240
"Didn't you shut down the show
last week,"

6
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,120
"after Russell Crowe named
a koala chlamydia ward after you ?"

7
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,060
Yes, I did. I did do that.

8
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,060
I went to Australia
to go work with the koalas.

9
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,140
But then I learned
two important things:

10
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,120
HBO contracts are a little harder
to get out of than I thought,

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,010
and these little horny fuckers
are not as cute as you'd expect.

12
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,130
They are nasty, they're mean,
they're not even technically bears,

13
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,220
and they kept asking whether or not
I knew James Corden and I don't !

14
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,270
I don't know him !
But I hear terrible things !

15
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:21,060
So unfortunately for everybody,
this show must continue.

16
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,090
And we begin tonight
with the Trump White House.

17
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,070
The only home in America where
the next occupant will have to ask

18
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,260
"what's the best way to get cum stains
out of Abe Lincoln's ghost ?"

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,270
Now, yeah. We're back.

20
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,280
It was another big week
for the Trump administration.

21
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,200
They got 3 American detainees
out of North Korea, which was great.

22
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,250
They pulled out of the Iran deal,
which may turn out to be catastrophic.

23
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,160
John Kelly said immigrants
lack the skills to assimilate,

24
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,260
which is ironic coming from someone
with the surname "Kelly".

25
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,190
And the first lady announced
her anti-cyber-bullying program,

26
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,170
appealing to people to be kind,
which was jarring, considering this.

27
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,100
Denials and deflections.

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,350
The White House refuses to talk
about a joke one employee made

29
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,480
about John McCain's
terminal illness.

30
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,370
A Trump aide joked

31
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,520
that John McCain's opposition
to Trump's pick for CIA Director

32
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,400
didn't matter
because "he's dying anyway".

33
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,420
That is shocking,
but it's also not really surprising.

34
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,450
These days, "Trump aide says
something awful" isn't really news.

35
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,300
It's a fact, like gravity
or the fact that "Young Sheldon"

36
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,310
will someday grow up
and look nothing like Jim Parsons

37
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,520
and all hell will break loose

38
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,380
because the world can't handle
an inconsistency like that !

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,380
But tonight let's ignore all of that
and focus on the busy week

40
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,390
for one person in particular:
Michael Cohen.

41
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,330
Donald Trump's personal lawyer
a lawyer so shitty he made Trump say:

42
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,300
"I need someone good,
get me Rudy Giuliani on the phone."

43
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,420
Think about that !

44
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,430
Cohen was already in hot water
for making a payment to Stormy Daniels

45
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,350
a potential violation
of campaign finance law

46
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,660
and this week,
the water got even hotter.

47
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,580
To the legal drama

48
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,680
swirling around President Trump's
attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen,

49
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,630
reaching a new level tonight
over millions of dollars in payments

50
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,730
and a serious allegation that Cohen
was selling access to President Trump.

51
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,610
Millions of dollars for access to Trump,
which is bizarre,

52
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,690
because I assumed that you
gained access to the president

53
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,560
by finding a golden ticket
in your MAGA hat.

54
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,630
Don't fall into the river of gravy,
little Charlie,

55
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,670
or you'll never be the next owner
of the racism factory !

56
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,700
Selling access
is a serious allegation.

57
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,760
There is a lot
that we don't know here.

58
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,750
What we can say is,
shortly after Trump was elected,

59
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,760
Michael Cohen suddenly
started making a lot of money.

60
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,730
It was funneled through a company that
he created, Essential Consultants,

61
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,600
a company
for which there is no logo

62
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,680
and even the name
arouses suspicion.

63
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,700
This company involves Cohen,
who is absolutely not essential.

64
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,770
He's also not a consultant,
plus there's only one of him,

65
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,600
so even the "s" in the company name
is a big, dumb lie.

66
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,510
And Cohen's pitch to potential clients
was pretty brazen.

67
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,410
A Republican strategist says his sales
pitch went something like this:

68
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,450
"I don't know who's been representing
you, but you should fire them all."

69
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,540
"I'm closest to the president.
I'm his personal lawyer."

70
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,610
It is a little bit weird. Lawyers
don't generally pitch themselves

71
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,500
by offering up
info on their other clients.

72
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,630
It's like a doctor saying

73
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,590
"If you hire me, I'll tell you about
all of Larry King's birthmarks."

74
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,560
First, you're not supposed
to be sharing that information.

75
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,540
And second...

76
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,430
The most eye-catching business
that Cohen drummed up

77
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,640
came from Columbus Nova,
an investment company,

78
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,500
linked to a Russian oligarch,
which paid him 500 000 dollars.

79
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,480
And they insist that the oligarch
had nothing to do with that payment,

80
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,520
and that they hired Cohen
for his expertise.

81
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:09,490
But what is Cohen an expert in,
other than wearing jackets

82
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,990
that look like they should be worn
by a leprechaun used car salesmen ?

83
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,850
And it wasn't just Columbus Nova.

84
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,970
Big companies gave money to Cohen,
including a defense contractor,

85
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,950
which paid him $150,000,
and pharmaceutical giant Novartis,

86
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,870
which agreed to pay him $1.2 million
for advice on U.S. healthcare policies.

87
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,910
But after only one meeting with him,
this happened.

88
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,980
Novartis says it quickly realized
Cohen could not provide them

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,910
the insight they wanted
on health care matters,

90
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,900
and the decision was taken
not to engage further.

91
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,000
The company still paid Cohen nearly
$1 million over the course of a year.

92
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,770
They met Cohen once,

93
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,800
and even though he still had months
to go on his million-dollar contract,

94
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,900
they decided
"Let's never see this guy ever again."

95
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:03,770
They basically paid a million dollars
not to talk to Michael Cohen,

96
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,920
which when you put it that way,
starts to sound like kind of a bargain.

97
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,960
And Novartis
wasn't the only company

98
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,770
who put a stupid amount of faith
in Cohen's non-existent expertise.

99
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,680
On the very first business day
of the Trump administration,

100
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,670
the president's personal attorney,
Michael Cohen,

101
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,660
signed a contract with AT and T

102
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,610
to receive $600,000
to consult on long-term planning.

103
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,710
On the first business day
of Trump's presidency,

104
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,760
Cohen signed a deal with AT and T,

105
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,650
who are trying to take over
our parent company, Time Warner.

106
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,760
They said they only paid him to "better
understand the president's thinking."

107
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,640
Which is ridiculous. If you want
to understand this president's thinking,

108
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,600
simply have a donkey kick you
in the head five times

109
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,770
and then watch Fox News
for 72 hours straight.

110
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,560
That'll give you a pretty good idea
about what's going on in his mind.

111
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,680
We probably don't yet know the full
significance of all of these payments.

112
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,750
I would argue that these companies
got exactly what they paid for.

113
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,710
They wanted to understand
how the Trump administration worked.

114
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,770
They put their trust in a novice
who turned out to be a moron,

115
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,610
and who was bilking them
for personal gain.

116
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,640
You wanted to know how
the Trump administration works ?

117
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:25,450
Congratulations ! You just got
a fucking master class. And now this.

118
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,440
And now: Local news gets real
about Mother's Day.

119
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,520
Mother's Day shouldn't be another day
where we do the same old thing. Brian !

120
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,440
What are your plans
for Mother's Day ?

121
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,610
My wife is going to leave me
with two children.

122
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,500
I will figure it out.
Those are my plans.

123
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,470
You always do this.

124
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,460
She just told me,
"I'm leaving, good luck to you."

125
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,530
- God. You're being a good husband.
- Yeah, not a choice.

126
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,570
- What are you gonna do ?
- For my wife ?

127
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,630
Let her sleep
and not talk for 30 seconds

128
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,500
till she's after started
drinking coffee.

129
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,530
That's it ?

130
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,430
Hooters has free meals for your mom,
if your wife or mother

131
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,590
is okay with going
to Hooters on Mother's Day.

132
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,560
Every year we say
"Mom we're gonna go walking with you,"

133
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:15,500
and she's like "I could like go get
a spa gift card, a massage..."

134
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,010
Maybe that says
something about you.

135
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,960
We were standing in the kitchen
our eyes met

136
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,810
and then she gave me
the stink eye.

137
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,920
That's what happened,
it was real awkward.

138
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,820
She gave you the "It's this Sunday,
you better get on the ball."

139
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:29,930
I felt bad.

140
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,930
Moving on: our main story tonight
concerns Venezuela.

141
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,960
Not to be confused with Benezela,
that is the hot new celebrity couple

142
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,850
that's just Ben Affleck
fucking a vuvuzela.

143
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,030
Yeah. He's happy.
You should be happy for him.

144
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,960
Now, Venezuela is the country
famous for giving the world oil,

145
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,960
seven Miss Universes,
six Miss Worlds,

146
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,810
and of course, most importantly,
one Wilmer Valderrama

147
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,000
who I like to think of as the
"Miss Universe" of "That '70s Show."

148
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,000
Over the last few years, every time
Venezuela has been on the news,

149
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,910
something awful
has been happening.

150
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,920
Food riots and looting.

151
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,830
This is the only daily diet
Venezuelans can count on.

152
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,090
Protesters stormed
the National Assembly.

153
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,970
Punching lawmakers.

154
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,960
A stolen police helicopter fires
on Venezuela's Supreme Court.

155
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,070
The clashes in Caracas
between protesters and police

156
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,920
are looking
more like all-out war.

157
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,090
Things in Venezuela have been
extremely grim. So fair warning here:

158
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:40,130
this is not going to be one of those
"feel good" Last Week Tonight stories,

159
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:44,010
"Slippers," "Everything Looks
Okay At The Pudding Factory,"

160
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,130
"A Genocide, But It's Only
Happening To Balloon Animals."

161
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,160
And it has been hard
to keep up with events in Venezuela,

162
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:54,080
due to the hurricane of shit
that we've all been dealing with here.

163
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,970
If you follow conservative media,
you may have seen it painted

164
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,130
as the inevitable, dire consequences
of a socialist government.

165
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,150
Watch this Infowars reporter

166
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,070
quizzing an extremely chill
Bernie Sanders supporter.

167
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,990
- You know Venezuela ?
- Heard of it.

168
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,090
A majority of the country
is eating rats

169
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,110
while their politicians
are drinking champagne.

170
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,140
If Bernie Sanders
were president, right ?

171
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,060
And he wanted to bring the same ideas
as for socialism into this country...

172
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,040
- Do you think that we would benefit ?
- Yeah.

173
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,920
But I told you
Venezuela's eating rats !

174
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,030
But I just want people
to have healthcare, honey.

175
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,160
Same thing Hugo Chávez...

176
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,110
when he was taking,
when he was taking over Venezuela.

177
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,110
God ! You people have worms
in your brain, honestly.

178
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,950
That is not great news
for that Infowars reporter

179
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,970
she essentially just got served
by sassy Popeye.

180
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,130
But what you do have
there is a nice distillation

181
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,980
of the current level
of political discourse in America:

182
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,090
two people who don't know
what they're talking about

183
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,140
condescending to each other
until one of them lands a sick burn.

184
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,950
What is happening in Venezuela
is not just extremely important,

185
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,090
it is absolutely
worth paying attention to.

186
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,680
This is not just a story
about socialism

187
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,770
there are plenty of socialist countries
that look nothing like Venezuela

188
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,600
it's a story about epic
mismanagement.

189
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,600
So epic that a nation
of 31 million people,

190
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,770
with the largest oil reserves
in the world,

191
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,830
have been forced to resort to
creative forms of protest.

192
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,680
Social media ablaze
for the past few days

193
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,670
encouraging protesters to fill jars
and bags with human feces.

194
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,790
"This is one of our last options,"
says this masked man.

195
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,680
We are calling it
"poo-poo-tov" cocktails.

196
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,730
Yes, poo-poo-tov cocktails.

197
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:56,620
Named after the Soviet Premier
Vyacheslav Poopootov.

198
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,790
He was infamous for pooping in jars
and throwing them at people.

199
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:04,640
And while that is funny,
because, y'know... it's poop.

200
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,760
It is also desperate people
resorting to a desperate measure.

201
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,670
Venezuela is having
their presidential election.

202
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,750
We thought we'd check in
on what's been happening there,

203
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,670
to understand
how Venezuela got into this mess,

204
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,930
and how,
despite making it even worse,

205
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:26,910
their current president Nicolás Maduro
seen here going to town on a 'nana

206
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,900
is almost certainly going to win,

207
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,050
despite having the support
of only around 1/5 of the population.

208
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:35,060
To understand anything
about present day Venezuela,

209
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,010
you have to start with Maduro's
predecessor: Hugo Chávez,

210
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,890
shown here looking smug

211
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,970
about the fact that he's got
a bird in a hat on his shoulder.

212
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,110
Chávez was massively popular
in Venezuela, beloved for both

213
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,100
his generous social programs
and his larger-than-life personality.

214
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,980
Every Sunday he staged marathon
TV broadcasts

215
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,920
that sometimes ran up to eight hours
on his show "Aló Presidente."

216
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,930
The show featured special guests,
dance numbers, and prize giveaways.

217
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,110
Over here we have flat-screen TVs !
It's the opposite of capitalism !

218
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,000
Hold on, Hugo.

219
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,010
If giving away flat screen TVs
is the opposite of capitalism,

220
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:23,410
then the most successful socialist
leader is Comrade Drew Carey.

221
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,420
Chávez could act that way
because Venezuela was oil-rich,

222
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,540
and he took more state control
over their national oil company,

223
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,550
enabling him to fund
programs benefitting the poor.

224
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,540
When that company protested
some of the changes,

225
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,630
he responded by using his TV show
to address its executives.

226
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,640
I'm firing the following people.

227
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,630
Mr. Juan Fernandez, you are fired
from Petroleum of Venezuela.

228
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,440
Eddie Ramirez,
thank you, you are fired.

229
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:02,440
Mariana, if you don't stop talking
to your boyfriend you'll be fired.

230
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:09,460
Mateo, if you use the office kitchen to
microwave fish, I'll have you murdered.

231
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:16,530
To be fair to Chávez, many social
programs were initially effective.

232
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,480
During his tenure,
the poverty rate was halved.

233
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,850
Many Venezuelans revere Chávez
to a dramatic degree.

234
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,850
The late president's eyes are
painted on public buildings

235
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,890
as if watching over
the revolution.

236
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,920
This man even tattooing
the eyes onto his forehead.

237
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,960
That's the image, eyes of our supreme
commander Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías.

238
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,960
The eyes that see the world,
the whole world.

239
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:47,790
That is dedication.
I like my president so much,

240
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,950
I want him to watch me masturbate
for the rest of my life.

241
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,860
That's what those
eyes are gonna see.

242
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,890
They'll see other things,
they're also seeing that.

243
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,770
Some of Chávez's programs
could have been sustainable,

244
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,960
if he'd pursued a sound economic
policy and run a tight ship.

245
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,900
But not only did he stop saving
oil revenues in a rainy-day fund,

246
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,810
he oversaw a government that
Transparency International found

247
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,760
to be the most corrupt country
in Latin America.

248
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,840
Latin America
has Colombia in it !

249
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,300
A country where the only campaign
finance law is:

250
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,440
"report bribes consisting of
more than ten kilos of cocaine."

251
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:32,430
As long as the price of oil went up
forever and Chávez never died,

252
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,280
the cracks could've been
papered over.

253
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:40,320
In 2014, the price of oil plummeted
from over 100 dollars a barrel

254
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:43,410
to just 50 dollars a barrel,
just one year after Chávez

255
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:47,210
plummeted from being alive,
to being very much dead.

256
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,400
Here is where Maduro,
the big banana fan, comes in.

257
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,230
He was Chávez's
hand-picked successor,

258
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,340
but had neither his booming
economy, nor his charisma.

259
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,360
He has tried to make up for that,
even going so far as to tell people

260
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,340
he'd received messages
from the spirit of Chávez,

261
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,300
who'd visited him
in the form of a little bird.

262
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,290
It's a story he's told repeatedly,
and sometimes with sound effects.

263
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:19,370
Suddenly, a little bird came in and
circled three times above my head.

264
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:27,330
He stood on a wooden beam
and started whistling

265
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,350
and I felt his spirit.

266
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,290
I felt like he was giving us
a blessing.

267
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,250
What I like the most about that,
other than the whistling,

268
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,420
is the idea that when powerful
leaders die, they become birds.

269
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,390
That is an humiliating second act.
I led my people to greatness.

270
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:52,290
I will barf my lunch into my child's
mouth and fly into a glass window.

271
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:57,440
I don't want to say that Maduro's
charm offensive hasn't been working,

272
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:02,400
but watch this moment where he was
reading messages from viewers.

273
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,320
Moises David tells me:
"Nicolás Maduro suck on it."

274
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,220
You suck on your own.

275
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,280
You can suck yourself.

276
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:25,350
Maduro essentially appeared on
"Celebrities Read Mean Tweets"

277
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:26,950
completely by accident.

278
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,040
It's easy to see why Maduro
has pissed people off,

279
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:35,870
he has managed Venezuela's economic
crisis in the worst possible way.

280
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,830
He's doubled down on many
of Chávez's most unsound policies,

281
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,020
like unrealistic currency
and price controls,

282
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,810
while attempting to make up for missing
revenue by creating more money.

283
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:52,930
Inflation has exploded, with the IMF
forecasting 13 000 percent inflation

284
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,020
for 2018.

285
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,960
And to give you an idea
of just how ridiculous that can look,

286
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,910
this was a trip
to a Venezuelan market last year.

287
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,860
The currency is so devalued
some shopkeepers weigh the money

288
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
rather than waste time counting.

289
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,960
If residents are lucky enough
to find food on the shelves,

290
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,870
prices are out of sight.

291
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,000
This plantain costs what
your house cost 25 years ago ?

292
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,030
Two options there. Either inflation
is completely out of hand.

293
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,910
Or that is one incredible plantain.
I mean world-class plantain.

294
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:33,300
Inflation is one of many reasons
why many Venezuelans are struggling

295
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,480
to find or afford basic necessities
like medicine or food.

296
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,290
Those shortages have had
terrible consequences.

297
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:44,250
This food shortage is widespread.
Over the last year,

298
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:48,350
three-quarters of the population
lost an average of almost 20 pounds.

299
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,240
Look how fat I used to be.
This is how many holes

300
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,390
I had to make in my belt
on the "Maduro Diet."

301
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,410
Yes, "the Maduro Diet".
That is a commonly used phrase.

302
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:05,280
And it's a very healthy sounding term
for a truly horrifying situation.

303
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,370
Like saying Jim Jones was the pioneer
of the Jonestown Juice Cleanse.

304
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:16,260
It is not like Maduro isn't aware
that people are starving.

305
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,330
During one of his media
appearances, a reporter noticed

306
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,270
that the video feed cut away
every time Maduro helped himself

307
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,470
to the plates
of charcuterie and cakes.

308
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,280
He knew that eating
would look insensitive.

309
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,470
Watch this clip that
went viral last year

310
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:37,510
and know that what he's saying
doesn't matter.

311
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,430
Remember he's about to think
that the camera is off him.

312
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,480
He just housed an empanada
in front of a starving nation.

313
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,460
A nationwide famine
is no time for "fourth meal".

314
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:12,510
If you think that is the most tone-deaf
reaction to mass food shortages,

315
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:16,450
wait until you see him do some
insensitive crowd work.

316
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,440
Why are you so skinny, Gustavo ?

317
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,480
Have you been jogging ?

318
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,410
What happened to him ?

319
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:33,480
Maduro's Diet.
Maduro's Diet makes you hard.

320
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,760
No need for Viagra.

321
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,730
The most awkward presidential
attempt to be "in on the joke"

322
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,930
since Herbert Hoover claimed

323
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,930
"Hoover towns make you wet,
without cornmeal or castor oil."

324
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,930
They didn't understand how
vaginas worked back then.

325
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:02,870
Even when the Maduro government
tried to help,

326
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,940
it's done it
in a ham-fisted way.

327
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,910
Maduro has proposed
a so-called "Rabbit Plan",

328
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:11,790
a program to encourage
Venezuelans to breed and eat bunnies.

329
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:15,780
But when people started putting bows
on them and keeping them as pets,

330
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,730
his administration
gave a callous correction.

331
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,770
A rabbit is not a pet. It's two
and a half kilos of meat

332
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,950
high in protein,
with no cholesterol.

333
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,740
Holy shit. A rabbit is just
two and a half kilos of meat.

334
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,750
Less like a government
pronouncement and more like

335
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,960
a tank top Marlon Bundo used
to wear back in his clubbing days.

336
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:43,970
As for economic policy,
Maduro has lived in complete denial.

337
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,930
His most recent plan to address
rampant inflation was to introduce

338
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,840
a new version of their currency,
the Bolívar,

339
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,960
just with three zeroes
lopped off the end.

340
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:57,060
In case any part of you thinks that
might fix their inflation problem,

341
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:01,940
we asked Yale economist Robert Shiller
if that's how money works !

342
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,010
No, that's not how money works.

343
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,890
Thanks, Robert ! Thanks.
I appreciate it. It's good to know.

344
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,860
In the absence of solutions,
Maduro reached for the next best thing:

345
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:17,990
blaming someone else.

346
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:22,990
He's suggested the US was responsible
for injecting Chávez with cancer,

347
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,040
he said that the U.S. was sabotaging
Venezuelan ATMS

348
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,980
and he's chalked up protests
against him to this.

349
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,890
This is part of a scheme
of non-conventional war

350
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,180
the U.S. perfected
throughout recent decades.

351
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:43,190
America has done some awful
things in Central and South America.

352
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,210
We've backed coups attempts,
juntas and atrocities

353
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,250
in Chile, Argentina
and Guatemala.

354
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:53,050
But what's happening in Venezuela
is actually not our fault.

355
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,280
Accusing America of creating
Venezuela's crisis

356
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:00,240
is as fair as accusing O.J. Simpson
of murdering Princess Diana.

357
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,230
I'm not saying it would be
out of character,

358
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:07,230
it happens to not be true
in this particular instance.

359
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,040
That's basically
what I'm saying.

360
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:18,080
Despite all of this, Maduro
is about to dominate this election

361
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,180
like he dominated that banana.

362
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:26,130
How is that possible ? He's bent
the democratic process to his will.

363
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,260
In 2015, when his party
lost control of National Assembly,

364
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,090
he responded by stacking the
Supreme Court with 13 new justices

365
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,280
and created a new assembly.

366
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,380
President Nicolás Maduro
wants to create a political assembly

367
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,310
with the vast power
to rewrite the constitution

368
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,390
and dismantle the democratically
elected legislature.

369
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:52,300
All of the candidates are Maduro
supporters, including his wife and son.

370
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:56,390
Think about the sheer scale
of what Maduro did there.

371
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,420
That'd be like, if here, Trump put
his friends on the Supreme Court,

372
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:05,460
who then allowed him to create
a second Congress

373
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,380
and whose members
include Melania and Eric,

374
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,290
and which you just know
he'd call "Don-gress".

375
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:17,300
You know it ! Take that down
before he gets any ideas.

376
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,440
I regret brining it up.

377
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:24,470
Maduro has jailed or barred from
public office his political opponents

378
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,350
and has even turned down help from
other countries and agencies,

379
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,390
he has turned down
food and medicine,

380
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:37,340
telling Venezuelans that humanitarian
aid is part of a conspiracy.

381
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:41,780
All has left Venezuelans feeling
so hopeless that 1 million of them

382
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,880
left the country
over the past two years.

383
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,720
And many who've remained
are now at their breaking point.

384
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,670
Everyone in the world needs to know
we are dying of hunger.

385
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,860
We are living in a dictatorship
that is in disguise.

386
00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:01,640
There are many that are afraid and
can't speak out, they have us gagged.

387
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:06,670
If you speak out they send the militias
to harm you or kill you.

388
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,640
That's horrifying.
When you listen to her,

389
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,840
it starts to hit you that
poo-poo-tov cocktails

390
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,710
might turn out to be
pretty restrained.

391
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,870
There aren't a lot
of great options to help.

392
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:23,740
The Trump administration
imposed some sanctions,

393
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,830
but if they're not extremely careful,
those could cause more hardship.

394
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:33,770
Seeing as Maduro won't listen to
reason, or to the will of his people,

395
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:37,800
perhaps it's time to call in the one
voice we know he'll listen to.

396
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:41,500
So ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome a bird.

397
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:03,360
Hola, Maduro.
It's me, a bird.

398
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,500
Remember ?
We spoke a few years back.

399
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,510
If you're thinking: "this is just
Wilmer Valderrama in a bird suit ?"

400
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,280
You used to think
I was Hugo Chávez,

401
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:16,470
so you're not exactly
the authority on what's birds.

402
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,350
Listen up, buddy, 'cause I'm two and
a half kilos of high-protein and meat

403
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,380
and I'm here to tell you: you're
in some serious trouble, compadre.

404
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:33,340
It's not a good sign when people
are throwing their poop at you.

405
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,370
I should know. I'm a bird.

406
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:43,660
Come on, man.
I invented poo-poo-tov cocktails.

407
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,720
Every time a bird poops on you,
it was a political statement.

408
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:58,710
We aimed
and thought it was funny.

409
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:03,710
Maduro: the whole world can see
what mess you are making.

410
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,720
Even TV hosts here in
America, like that idiot.

411
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,640
Shit.

412
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:14,780
I was just having a little snack.

413
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,780
That's just bad timing, Zazu.

414
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,840
The point is, Maduro, you
need to accept humanitarian aid

415
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,880
and cool it with the dictator stuff

416
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,860
or I've got a poo-poo-tov cocktail
with your name on it right here.

417
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:45,730
This is it for me.
And because I am a real, actual bird,

418
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,790
I am going to exit
with effortless beauty and grace.

419
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,840
That's our show.
Thank you for watching.

420
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,870
We'll see you next week.
Goodnight !

421
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,750
Fly away ! Fly !

422
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:08,730
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

423
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,710
END OF EPISODE 11,
SEASON V
