00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,160
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,680
SEASON V
EPISODE 13

3
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,280
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,320
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,560
A quick recap of the week
and we begin with North Korea,

6
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,080
voted "Top Korea" by "We Meant It
Geographically" magazine.

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,680
This week, the June 12th summit
was suddenly back on,

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,120
after Trump met
with a North Korean envoy,

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,880
who had brought him this gigantic,
oversized letter from Kim Jong Un.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,280
As if smiling while holding
a letter from a dictator

11
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,560
were not enough of a propaganda
coup for North Korea,

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,960
the president raved
about it to the press.

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,560
Would you like to see
what was in that letter ? How much ?

14
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,040
It was a very interesting letter
and at some point I may be,

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,840
I'll be able to give it to you, maybe.

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,640
As infuriating a president as Trump is,
he would be an even worse Moses.

17
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,440
"Wouldn't you like to see
what's on these tablets. How much ?"

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,120
"Maybe I'll show you later,
if you're lucky."

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,280
If that wasn't weird enough,
just eight minutes later

20
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,720
after calling the contents
interesting, this happened.

21
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,800
I haven't seen the letter yet.
I purposely didn't open the letter.

22
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,280
I haven't opened it. I didn't
open it in front of the director.

23
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,440
I said: "You want me to open it ?"
he said: "you can read it later."

24
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,760
I may be in
for a big surprise, folks !

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,880
Yeah, you might though !
You just agreed to a summit

26
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,840
without reading the contents of
the letter that convinced you to do it.

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,920
Worst-case scenario,
it's a declaration of war.

28
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,760
Best-case scenario, it says:

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,680
"Donald, it's me. I have run to North
Korea and I'm never coming back."

30
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,000
"Melania, brackets,
your third wife."

31
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,200
For now let's move on to Ukraine.

32
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,000
Or, as Vladimir Putin calls it,
"Bonus Russia".

33
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,080
Ukraine was rocked
by some horrifying news.

34
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,080
A Russian journalist, critical of
Moscow's policies in Ukraine and Syria,

35
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,360
has been shot and killed in Kiev.

36
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,560
Arkady Babchenko,
a prominent Putin critic,

37
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,400
was murdered on Tuesday.

38
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,480
That's what made what happened
on Wednesday more remarkable.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,480
His friends, his family, even
his wife, thought he was dead.

40
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,160
But today,
a shocking turn of events.

41
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,600
Arkady Babchenko turned
up alive on Ukrainian TV.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,760
His fake death was all part of what
was described as a special operation

43
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,800
to take down a team
of Russian assassins.

44
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,240
Babchenko faked his death to bring
down a team of assassins,

45
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,720
which sounds less like
a legitimate news story than the plot

46
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,360
of a spy thriller called "Your Dad
Would Really Love This Book."

47
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,920
The plan to fake his death came
about after authorities learned

48
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,960
of a $40,000 contract to assassinate
him, paid for by Russian forces.

49
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,320
The plot was organized by a
man identified only as "Mr. G",

50
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,440
which I assume
refers to this man.

51
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,680
That's right, Kenny,
your cover is finally blown !

52
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,400
You can't play jazz as smooth as that
without secretly being a monster.

53
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,880
Some of the details of this fake
assassination are amazing.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,720
A make-up artist came to Babchenko's
apartment to stage his death.

55
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,440
His wife later found him lying
facedown in a pool of his own blood.

56
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,720
Which, it turns out,
was pig's blood.

57
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,000
He was then transferred to ambulance,
pronounced dead

58
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,440
and taken to a morgue where
he turned on the TV

59
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,080
and watched the news of his own
murder, which is pretty cool.

60
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,800
The only way it could have been
any cooler is if he watched it

61
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,160
on a Caribbean beach
with Tupac Shakur.

62
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,760
His coworkers were amazed
by this surprise news conference.

63
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,320
That is incredible to watch,
mainly because of how refreshing it is

64
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,760
to see an office where people
actually like their coworkers.

65
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,880
Normally if an office found out
a coworker thought dead was alive,

66
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,720
they'd quietly nod and go back
to talking shit about him on Gchat.

67
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,080
Some of you laughed
too hard at that.

68
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,760
Other media colleagues
were not quite as thrilled,

69
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,680
as CNN discovered
when they reached one friend.

70
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,000
I think the overriding emotion
that we all have right now is...

71
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,000
We're very pissed off.
He sort of put us through hell.

72
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,080
That's an understandable response.

73
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,160
I believe the apostle Paul's first
words to the resurrected Jesus were:

74
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,680
"real funny, shitbird".

75
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,920
It wasn't just his colleagues
with cause to be angry,

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,040
as a London radio host pointed out.

77
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,960
He apologized to his wife.
Wait for this, good lord.

78
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,920
He apologized to his wife because
she knew nothing about any of this,

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,240
so when she found her husband
in a pool of blood

80
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,040
having apparently
been shot in the back,

81
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,480
that was very real to her.

82
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,120
It's gonna to take quite a bunch
of flowers to get over that, isn't it ?

83
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,840
It is. He probably should get
his wife some flowers.

84
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,160
He won't have to spend any money,
he can pick up a ton at his grave.

85
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,200
Later reports indicated that his wife
was actually also in on the hoax.

86
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,120
At this point who can know anything
anymore ? Is he even married ?

87
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,640
Or is his wife Babchenko in a dress,
holding a fake passport,

88
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,680
ready to flee the country ?

89
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,840
And it's why some reporters
criticized Babchenko,

90
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,440
arguing that this plays
into Russia's hands

91
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,000
in dismissing actual crimes
as "fake news".

92
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,840
Babchenko has been borderline
cocky in the wake of this operation.

93
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,800
Having cheated death,
Arkady Babchenko says

94
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,160
he will live to dance
on Vladimir Putin's grave.

95
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,840
I really hope that's true, Babs,
but I wouldn't be so sure.

96
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,440
You're implying that because
you faked your death,

97
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,400
you're somehow immune
from future assassination,

98
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,960
which I don't think
is how anything works.

99
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,720
You're assuming that Putin
will end up in a grave,

100
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,560
and there's no way that's true.

101
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,360
When Putin does die in 400 years,
his body will simply explode

102
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,280
into hundreds of bats that
scatter into the night sky.

103
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,160
We'd like to move onto the UK,

104
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,480
where, now that Prince Harry
is officially off the market,

105
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,560
the country's most eligible bachelor
is Mervyn Gurzcrop Crawlings,

106
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,640
from the village
of Mudford Sock.

107
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,640
He can't hear you, so speak up !

108
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,080
He's 32 years old.
So your move, ladies.

109
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,640
If you were one of the millions who
watched last month's royal wedding,

110
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,560
you remember this man, chairman
of the British Monarchist Society,

111
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,680
who provided color commentary
about the royal family.

112
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,880
What we're seeing is quite the change.
She's brought a California lifestyle.

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,800
She's slimming him down,
she's putting him on shakes.

114
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,760
What Brit
doesn't like meat ?

115
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,240
I'll take this one: Morrissey.
I mean, pretty famously, Morrissey.

116
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,560
Try it, offer him a steak sometime
and see what happens.

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,120
That man is
Thomas J. Mace-Archer-Mills Esquire,

118
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,880
and if you think
that's the most British he gets,

119
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,000
look at this actual photo of him,
taken, I assume,

120
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,520
at the Alice In Wonderland
wrap party or in the year 1865,

121
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,200
the only two times
that outfit should be legal.

122
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,160
This week, we learned something
amazing about him.

123
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,920
This royal expert
seemed like the real deal.

124
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,640
What Meghan wore was absolutely
ideal for the ceremony.

125
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,560
But get this: this royal expert
is from New York.

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,320
Born Tommy Muscatello, in the small
upstate town of Bolton Landing.

127
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,960
It's true. That British man is
Tommy Muscatello from New York.

128
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,600
And that is a destabilizing
thing to learn.

129
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,000
If this guy isn't British,
who the fuck is ?

130
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,520
Am I actually British ?
Well let me reassure you:

131
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,840
my parents are listed
in my phone as "Mr. And Mrs. Oliver"

132
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,840
so I am definitely British.

133
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,800
What is most galling
about Tommy Muscatello is that,

134
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,040
as a defender of the monarchy,
he used his airtime to argue

135
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,240
that Meghan was a brash interloper
who needed to proceed with care.

136
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,200
You do not upstage the future
queen of this country,

137
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,040
especially when you're coming in
the way you are.

138
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,400
When you start to take the spotlight
from someone like Catherine

139
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,120
and then you swoop into the UK:
"Here I am, American !'"

140
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,800
You're wanting to upstage the Duchess
of Cambridge and the future queen...

141
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,960
I won't have it.

142
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:29,320
You won't have it, will you ?
Let me make this perfectly clear:

143
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,200
Meghan Markle's American passport
is not an insult to anyone.

144
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:38,640
"Thomas J. Mace Archer-Mills
Esquire," is offensively British.

145
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,560
That is the equivalent of a British
pretending to be an American

146
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,200
and calling themselves
"Jefferson Budweiser McNuggets, Jr".

147
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,840
It's actively racist.

148
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,120
Since he was outed as an American,
he has done a round of interviews,

149
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,840
in which he's doubled down
on his Britishness.

150
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,440
Look at what happened when
he was asked an obvious question.

151
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,560
I have to ask you, how did
you get your British accent ?

152
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,920
It's what I was taught.
It's what I studied, two online courses

153
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,280
and also practicing with my people
I consider close friends and family.

154
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,400
Do you ? Marvelous !

155
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,560
Online courses ?
I'm calling bullshit on that one,

156
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,520
unless University of Phoenix
offers a class called

157
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,320
"How To Convince People
You're Not From New York"

158
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,920
"By Doing A C-Minus
Hugh Grant Impression."

159
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,120
In case you're wondering about
that "close friends and family" line,

160
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,560
he has an agreement with two,
unrelated, elderly British individuals

161
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,240
to call them
his grandfather and grandmother.

162
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,040
He went to Europe, met an old lady,
asked her to be his grandmother

163
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,320
and now he knows
all about the monarchy.

164
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,320
If that sounds familiar,
it's 'cause it's literally

165
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,880
the exact backstory
of Babar the Elephant.

166
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,160
When he was pressed on all this,
he got a little testy.

167
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,720
I stopped living in New York
when I was in my teens.

168
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,440
The way I speak is the way I speak.
It's natural to me.

169
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,280
I am good at what I do. I'm
knowledgeable in my subject.

170
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,560
I know more about the British
monarchy than most people in Britain.

171
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,880
That might actually be true and
that should've tipped everyone off,

172
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,280
most British people, we don't care
either way about the monarchy.

173
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,680
But the thing that bothers me
is that pretending to be British

174
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,080
by becoming a royal expert
is just so lazy.

175
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,800
If you want to pull the wool
over people's eyes,

176
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,320
get a spot on "The Daily Show", bide
your time, perfect your fake accent

177
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,320
and land your own weekly
program on HBO.

178
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,720
Have I said too much ?

179
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,080
And now this.

180
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:58,320
The very British put-downs of Speaker
of House of Commons, John Bercow.

181
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,680
Order !

182
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,520
Mr. Docherty-Hughes,
you're in a very emotional condition !

183
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,560
Let me say to the honorable gentleman
who I've known for a long time,

184
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,400
when he comes to reflect on his
comeback, he can do better than that.

185
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,360
Those prating away
should cease doing so.

186
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,520
It's stupid and counterproductive.
Both sides shouting their heads off.

187
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,480
It's very downmarket,
it's very low grade.

188
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:35,640
You are a boisterous fellow, you appear
to be chewing some sort of gum.

189
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,720
You may be a cheeky chappy but
also an exceptionally noisy one.

190
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,120
You were much better behaved when
you were at Oxford University !

191
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,080
Mr. Pound, you're
supposed to be a senior statesman.

192
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,880
Calm yourself, man !
Get a grip of yourself, man !

193
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,720
Calm yourself, take up yoga.

194
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,240
Take some soothing medicament or
go and lie down for a little while.

195
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,560
Let me say to the assiduous but
overenthusiastic government whip,

196
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,120
the honorable gentleman
member for Hexham,

197
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,400
that his role is to be seen
and not heard.

198
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,520
He was born and raised in Brooklyn.
Now moving on.

199
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,440
Our main story tonight
concerns senior citizens.

200
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,040
People who stay active by
playing shuffleboard, going on walks

201
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,120
or performing their hit
"I Can't Get No Satisfaction"

202
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,800
in front of packed arenas.

203
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,160
Many senior citizens remain
active and independent,

204
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,200
like this woman, who CNN
interviewed when she was 104

205
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,320
and shared
her secret for her health.

206
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,920
- You're drinking Dr. Pepper.
- That's exactly right.

207
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,600
This stuff is good.
It's got sugar in it,

208
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:48,240
and two doctors told me that if I drink
it, I will die, but they died first.

209
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,120
Follow-up question:
did you kill those two doctors ?

210
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,960
You seem awfully proud of that fact.
I'm not saying that you did,

211
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,880
I'm saying serial killers always
want recognition for their crimes.

212
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,720
We have a lot of senior citizens.
49 million Americans are 65 and older

213
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,480
and that number
is expected to sharply increase,

214
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,920
in a demographic surge that some
called the "Silver Tsunami",

215
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,320
the nickname
Christopher Plummer goes by

216
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,720
at his underground
cage-fighting ring.

217
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,040
If you get caught in
the Silver Tsunami's flurry of fists,

218
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,040
you're waking up
in the hospital.

219
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,720
Not everyone remains as sharp
and self-sufficient in their old age

220
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,440
as that murderer
laughing at her dead doctors.

221
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,080
Some of us are going
to wind up needing extra care.

222
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,080
That could place us in a system
called guardianship

223
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,360
and I'll let a Maryland judge explain,
as a camera pushes into his face.

224
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,560
A guardian is someone
appointed by the court

225
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:51,560
to act on behalf of an individual
under a mental or physical disability

226
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,640
and as a result, is unable
to make responsible decisions

227
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,960
about his or her care or property.

228
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,160
He's right. That zoom
wasn't actually planned.

229
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,520
The cameraman was so taken by
the judge's animal magnetism,

230
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,800
he couldn't resist
moving in closer.

231
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,840
The final shot was just the camera
pressed up against his mustache.

232
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,960
Guardianship is an important,
valuable tool.

233
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,720
Here is how it works:

234
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,400
an elderly person who lives
alone is showing signs of dementia.

235
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,040
Any concerned person
could petition a court,

236
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,680
which might appoint a guardian,
to help them make decisions.

237
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,520
That could be a family member.

238
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,480
Or if there is no family,
or if the family is fighting,

239
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,960
the court might appoint a professional
paid to manage their affairs.

240
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,160
When this system works, it's great.

241
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,320
But it probably won't surprise you
that is not what this story is about.

242
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,880
That's simply not what we do on
"I Wanted To Watch A Comedy Show"

243
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,080
"And Go To Sleep But Now I'm Sad
With Johnny Joy-Killer."

244
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,520
Let me show you what can happen
when guardianship goes wrong.

245
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,800
Take the case
of Rudy and Rennie North.

246
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,600
They were living happily
in Las Vegas when one day,

247
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,960
there was a knock on the door,
I'll let Rudy take it from here.

248
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:11,760
I open the door and they said that
they were "officers of the court."

249
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,760
Rudy says the officers
gave the couple three options.

250
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,640
One, we call the police.

251
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,680
Two, we have
you go to a psychiatric ward.

252
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,520
Choice three ?
An assisted living facility.

253
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,160
That is three terrible options.

254
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,320
Like playing "fuck, marry, kill"
with the Chipmunks.

255
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,600
None of them ! None of that. I'll kill
myself ! Taking the easy way out.

256
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,400
There was a knock on
the Norths' door

257
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,960
and they were moved to a facility,
by a woman they had never met,

258
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,080
who was given control of them
by a judge, who they also never met.

259
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,880
They got out
from under that guardian's control,

260
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,720
two years later,
most of their money was gone.

261
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,840
Something that Rudy is
still furious about.

262
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:04,520
They're strippers.
They strip everything from you.

263
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:10,720
We have nothing left. No money,
no assets, nothing. Nothing left.

264
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,120
I really feel for him, although,
I also must defend strippers here

265
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,840
because they get rid of their own
clothes, not somebody else's.

266
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,440
Someone who walks around getting
rid of other people's clothes

267
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,000
is either a criminal or Tan France
from the reboot of Queer Eye.

268
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,560
Let's talk about
our system of guardianship.

269
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,320
Far more people
are under it than you may think.

270
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,480
One study estimated the figure to be
around 1.3 million people

271
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:43,080
and guardians can have a huge
power over people under their care

272
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,360
or their "wards".

273
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,880
Because they may have to make
financial and health decisions,

274
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,080
they can have access from wards'
bank accounts to their health records.

275
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,680
As for the wards themselves,
they can lose a lot of their rights,

276
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,360
from being able to vote in elections
to being able to get married.

277
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,600
No small thing,
as one judge will tell you.

278
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,120
Guardianship is a massive
intrusion into a person's life.

279
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,840
They lose a lot of rights.

280
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,880
They lose more rights
than someone who goes to prison.

281
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,960
Less rights than someone in prison.
That is pretty shocking.

282
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,040
The only things that you do have
the right to do in prison

283
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,880
are sleep, eat, work out, and play
backgammon with Phil Spector.

284
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,840
He's really good at it.
It's all he does now.

285
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,800
He's finished with the killing.
That was just a phase for Phil.

286
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:35,600
The fact that guardians gain control
of their wards' finance is problematic.

287
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,920
Private guardians can bill for each
service they provide,

288
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,920
from leaving voice messages
to just opening the mail

289
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,440
and they can take payment
directly out of their wards' estate.

290
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,520
And those charges can accumulate fast,
and sometimes seem ridiculous.

291
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,520
The family of Marie Long objected
to her guardians taking her

292
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,480
on a weirdly expensive outing.

293
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,600
Look at what Sun Valley charged Marie
to send her and their worker

294
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,080
to a Phoenix Suns basketball game.

295
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,440
Over a thousand dollars for
research, phone calls, a limo.

296
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,360
Sun Valley even charged Marie

297
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,960
$228 to "determine the effect
of the game on her mood."

298
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:20,720
They charged her $228 to figure out
how a Suns game affected her mood.

299
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,280
Which is absurd,
I'll tell you that for free:

300
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,120
it was a Phoenix Suns Game,
it made her sad.

301
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,000
Try it yourself, go to a game
and see if it improves your mood

302
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,120
to see Dragan Bender put up four points
and one and a half rebounds.

303
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,080
Spoiler alert, it won't.

304
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,520
When Rudy and Rennie's guardian,
April Parks,

305
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,720
was confronted over some of what
she'd charged them for,

306
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,520
she didn't stand her ground.

307
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,120
Rudy and Rennie
were charged $780 each

308
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,680
for court filings and travel time
to court on the same days in 2013.

309
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,400
That's over fifteen hundred dollars
to this couple.

310
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,520
Who you're saying doesn't have
enough money already.

311
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,760
We will happily reverse
those charges out.

312
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,640
How about $108 Parks charged Rennie
to buy her a pair of stretch pants.

313
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,000
- 108 bucks sound reasonable ?
- I'm happy to reverse that.

314
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,720
Can't just do a bunch of shitty things
and then say "I'll reverse it".

315
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,080
This is someone's life,
not a fucking Missy Elliot song.

316
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,680
You probably need good stretch pants
if you're going to put your thing down,

317
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,560
flip it and reverse it.

318
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,520
The Norths weren't the only ones

319
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,800
who had questions
about April Parks' billing practices.

320
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,440
She had up to a hundred wards
at a single time,

321
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,920
and in a court case
a curious fact emerged.

322
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,360
Parks was a no-show in court,

323
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,400
but her voice was heard through
her own financial records.

324
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,080
Some days were 100 hours
of billing. Not physically possible.

325
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,280
100 hours a day
is not physically possible.

326
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,720
Unless she was working on Mercury,
where, as we all know,

327
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,840
each day lasts fourteen
hundred and seven earth hours.

328
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,520
That's a joke exclusively designed
for Neil DeGrasse Tyson.

329
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,160
I hope you enjoyed it, Dr. Tyson,
absolutely nobody else did.

330
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,880
Out of interest,
did you enjoy it ?

331
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,120
Yeah, but the time you gave
was the rotation rate of Mercury.

332
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,160
That's not the same thing
as a day.

333
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,680
A day on Mercury would be
from sunrise to sunrise.

334
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,960
On Mercury, that lasts three times
longer than what you just gave.

335
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,560
Shut up, Neil !
Why do you have to ruin everything ?

336
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,120
Enjoy something for once
in your life. What is wrong with you ?

337
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,680
You feckless, never mind.
It's not worth it. Bad idea.

338
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,320
April Parks' cavalier approach
to her wards continued

339
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,840
even after some of them died,
because when this guy here

340
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,640
bought a storage unit at auction,
you will never guess what he found.

341
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,000
27 urns.
27 sets of different ashes.

342
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,720
Some a few years old, others
from the early two-thousands.

343
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,400
Somebody had the gall to store
a family member in a storage unit.

344
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,720
That somebody according
to Valley Funeral Home directors

345
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,480
was this woman, April Parks.

346
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,880
She just left urns,
full of other people's family members,

347
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,240
in a storage unit.

348
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,040
And the only way that could've
been in worse taste

349
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,240
was if she'd poured them into a pinata
for a 9-year-old's birthday party.

350
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,880
"Happy birthday, Matthew.
Nine's a fun age."

351
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,760
Parks was arrested, not for the urn
thing, which was completely legal.

352
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,360
She is facing trial on over "200 felony
charges including racketeering,"

353
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,480
"theft, exploitation
and perjury."

354
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,960
How did she even get so many
wards in the first place ?

355
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,920
Why didn't the Federal Bureau
of Guardian Oversight stopped her ?

356
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,760
Because that agency doesn't exist.
We just made it up.

357
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,880
And the fact that one of the symbols
on that logo was Harvey Keitel's face,

358
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,360
should've really been
a giveaway for you.

359
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,920
Guardianship is the responsibility
of state and local courts,

360
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,520
meaning in most places,
everything about it,

361
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,360
from who becomes one, to who
they oversee is up to local judges,

362
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,760
who may be elected
and may have no legal training.

363
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,600
In much of Texas, guardianship
decisions are made by county judges

364
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,280
and only 29 of the judges
in those 211 counties are lawyers.

365
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,560
The rest are farmers, car dealers
and insurance salesmen.

366
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,840
Those courts do not have the resources
to monitor cases properly.

367
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,680
When Texas recently audited their
guardianships, they found that

368
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,960
over 3 000 wards had died
without the court knowing.

369
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,080
And "are they alive or dead ?"
is the absolute least you should know

370
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,000
about someone under your care.

371
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,200
If a zookeeper didn't know
that 3 000 of his animals were dead,

372
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,240
you'd put someone else
in charge of that fucking zoo,

373
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,200
or rebrand it as an
"open-air exotic meat market."

374
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,600
And on top of all this,
only 12 states require

375
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,600
professional guardians
to be certified at all.

376
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,200
So just about anyone
can become one.

377
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,320
Government Accountability
Office looked into this,

378
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,200
their findings were troubling.

379
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,640
Most jobs handling even
small amounts of cash require

380
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,400
some sort of criminal background
check and or a credit check,

381
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,600
but the G.A.O. found in most cases
guardians for the elderly

382
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,640
can handle millions of dollars
and states failed to require either.

383
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,040
It's like putting the fox
in the chicken coop basically,

384
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,560
they'll steal money.

385
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,800
Exactly. Although not every fox
is out to steal from you.

386
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,920
That's an offensive stereotype based
on Swiper from "Dora The Explorer".

387
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,560
It's not all foxes.
Hashtag not all foxes.

388
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,920
I'm looking at this that
also says "no tall foxes".

389
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,760
But I do agree with that as well.
A tall fox would be very scary

390
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,040
and awareness must be raised,
hashtag no tall foxes.

391
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,920
This lack of oversight is worrying in
a system that can be easy to fall into

392
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,400
and very difficult to get out of.

393
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,400
It took Rudy and Rennie two years
to get out from under April Parks.

394
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,560
It was not easy. Although luckily for
them, Rudy was pretty determined.

395
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,440
We're going to pursue it all their way
and we're going for their balls.

396
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,080
Just so they know.
It's their balls we want.

397
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:34,280
Okay, that's fine.
Rudy seems determined.

398
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,760
He also seems like the first person
in history interested in balls.

399
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,480
Generally, balls are to the body
what Starz is to a cable package.

400
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,680
It comes with it,
we understand that,

401
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,400
it's not nice to look at, and nobody
really knows what to do with it.

402
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,080
I am not saying that guardianship,
as a system, is inherently bad.

403
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,640
There are people who need it
and there are going to be more of them

404
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,680
as the Silver Tsunami approaches.

405
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,600
That is all the more reason for us
to improve its checks and balances,

406
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,480
to more funding for oversight.

407
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,560
There are steps everyone can take to
avoid being taken advantage of in.

408
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,320
Experts tell it is important to have
honest conversations with your family

409
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,600
and I know, that sounds
like a fucking nightmare.

410
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,120
but you have to have these
conversations about how you want

411
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,640
you and your finances to be taken
care of, should the need arise.

412
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,560
That will help prevent
a court from having to step in

413
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,760
and appointing a private guardian that
could turn out to be an April Parks.

414
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,880
There are some concrete
legal steps that you can take.

415
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,000
If you are a little older,
you may not want to hear advice

416
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,920
from a fresh-faced "holy-shitis
he-really only-41-year-old ?"

417
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,880
We've enlisted some help
to get the message across.

418
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,680
We all get old eventually.

419
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,240
It's just part of life.

420
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,720
Someday you will too.

421
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,400
Obviously,
you won't age as well as us.

422
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,160
We're glamorous celebrities with access
to skincare technology

423
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,680
that won't be
on the market for decades.

424
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,840
Look how supple my cheeks are.

425
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,800
- You might not age at all.
- You might die tonight, young.

426
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,360
- By getting hit by lightening.
- Or eating too many Tide Pods.

427
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,080
- Or getting killed by a hippo.
- That's more likely than you think.

428
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,360
They kill hundreds
of people each year.

429
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,160
Think they're cute ?
They're killing machines.

430
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,280
Look at this.

431
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,280
Hippos are terrible.

432
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,440
We're not here
to talk about hippos.

433
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,560
- I am.
- Me too.

434
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,760
I love hippos.

435
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,680
We're not talking about hippos ?

436
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,200
I thought this was
a whole hippo thing !

437
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,280
Getting older can mean needing
someone to help look after you.

438
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,160
Make sure that that's someone you
know and not some random person,

439
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,120
who just wants to spend your money
on fucking stretch pants.

440
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,000
Select someone to serve as your
healthcare representative.

441
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,040
Someone who can make decisions
under a durable power of attorney.

442
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,040
- Name people you trust.
- Like your son, or daughter.

443
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,440
- Or close friend.
- Or Mr. Tom Hanks.

444
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,920
- Tom Hanks is the best.
- Such a nice boy.

445
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,960
Jimmy Stewart would've been
my go-to guy, that was in the past.

446
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,920
Make sure they're people
you'd be comfortable with.

447
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,240
- Making financial or health decisions.
- On your behalf.

448
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,400
I hereby make Tom Hanks.

449
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,800
Mr. Tom Jefferson Hanks.

450
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,360
My healthcare representative.

451
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,200
This clipboard is filthy.

452
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,000
- Signed, yours truly.
- Done.

453
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,040
Always share these documents
with your friends and family.

454
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,520
Discuss your plans
so everyone's on the same page.

455
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,960
And even if this feels far off.

456
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,680
You've got to start
planning for the future now.

457
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,280
Now.

458
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,480
Now.
Also, hippos are killing machines.

459
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,520
That's the real message here.

460
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,800
Fuck hippos.

461
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,800
What is wrong
with you people ?

462
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,400
That's our show, thank you.
See you next week ! Good night !

463
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,800
They kill hundreds
of people each year.

464
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,240
You think they're cute ?

465
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,640
They're fucking machines.
No not fuck...

466
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:35,360
And how do I know that ?
You may well ask.

467
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,520
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

468
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,600
END OF EPISODE 13,
SEASON V
