00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,920
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,920
SEASON V
EPISODE 25

3
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,160
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,760
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,640
We begin with President Trump,
the mentally unstable man

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,560
with nuclear weapons
who we all love making angry.

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,040
By his standards, the president
had a pretty good week

8
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,000
and it says something about those
standards that a pretty good week

9
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,800
still includes
a "New York Times" investigation

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,560
about him possibly
having committed tax fraud,

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,200
a story that you forgot about
until just now and also this.

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,960
Yesterday while boarding Air Force One,
see there on his left foot ?

13
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,840
Commander in Chief
climbing the stairs

14
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,520
with what appears to be
some toilet paper stuck to his shoe.

15
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,400
While that is funny, it's also
unsurprising, isn't it ?

16
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,640
No one would be shocked
if he boarded Air Force One

17
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,200
with an entire toilet
stuck to his shoe.

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,760
It would be totally on brand.
The big news was Brett Kavanaugh,

19
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,200
confirmed
to the Supreme Court yesterday.

20
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,800
His confirmation was guaranteed
when Susan Collins announced

21
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,840
she was voting yes, decision described
by the "Wall Street Journal" op-ed page

22
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,120
as "Susan Collins Consents", their
most grossly inappropriate headline

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,120
since 1963's
"Kennedy Blows His Top".

24
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,840
While many were concerned about how
this would affect Christine Ford,

25
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,440
who testified so bravely,
the president,

26
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,880
who had said
that he found Ford credible,

27
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,720
made fun of her during a rally

28
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,840
and argued everyone was forgetting
the real victims in this process.

29
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,800
It's a very scary time
for young men in America,

30
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,560
when you can be guilty of something
that you may not be guilty of.

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,240
This is a very difficult time.

32
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,720
Is it though ? This seems like a way
less scary time for young men

33
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,840
than for old men in America.

34
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,360
'Cause of the two people
in this picture,

35
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,720
Timmy is getting information
about what sexual assault is

36
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,920
and how not to commit it as he prepares
for the rocky waters of his puberty,

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,800
while grandpa is stuck with
all the sexual assaults he's committed.

38
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,120
Look at him clenching that baseball.
He knows what he did !

39
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,120
And there's nothing left to do
but run out the clock.

40
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,440
What became clear this week was
that no step in this process

41
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,400
had a chance of altering
Republicans' course.

42
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,640
Not Blasey Ford's testimony, the wildly
inadequate FBI investigation,

43
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,040
not a letter signed
by 2 400 law professors

44
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,680
saying they opposed his appointment,
not even Justice Stevens

45
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,720
arguing that after watching
Kavanaugh's testimony,

46
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,720
he no longer felt that
he was fit to serve on the court.

47
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,720
No one embodied the Republicans
indifference better than Orrin Hatch,

48
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,120
who was confronted by protestors
and reacted like this.

49
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,200
Why aren't you brave enough
to talk to us and exchange with us ?

50
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,760
Don't you wave your hand at me.
I wave my hand at you.

51
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,600
- When you grow up.
- When we grow up ?!

52
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,920
How dare you talk to women that
way. How dare you ?

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,200
Setting aside the condescension
of telling adult women to grow up,

54
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,760
that wave
is a pretty clear "fuck you".

55
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,640
I believe that wave is what
they call a "Utah middle finger".

56
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,960
If one thing characterized
this process,

57
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,320
it was a shameless
commitment to bad-faith argument

58
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,960
appealing to principles
you don't believe in

59
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,960
or have no intention
of upholding.

60
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,080
Look at Mitch McConnell. He accused
Democrats of being obstructionist,

61
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,480
which is a little hard to take
from someone

62
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,680
who not only blocked Merrick Garland,
he even bragged about it.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,320
One of my proudest moments is when
I looked at Obama in the eye

64
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,640
and I said: "You will not
fill this Supreme Court vacancy."

65
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,680
One of your proudest moments ?
McConnell has three children.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,080
An awkward Thanksgiving when you
have to look at them and tell them

67
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,080
that nothing that they have done
can possibly compare to that one time

68
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,200
you were a dick
to the cool president.

69
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,800
Chuck Grassley railed against
the falsehoods

70
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,120
that he said Democrats had
circulated against Kavanaugh.

71
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,000
When presented with
a baseless conspiracy theory

72
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,680
about the protestors
who yelled at Jeff Flake,

73
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,760
look how quickly
he co-signed on it.

74
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,400
Do you believe George Soros
is behind this,

75
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,040
paying these people to get you
and your colleagues in elevators

76
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,200
or wherever they can get
in your face ?

77
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,560
I have heard
so many people believe that.

78
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,800
I tend to believe it.
I believe it fits in his attack mode

79
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:25,160
that he has and how he uses
his billions of resources.

80
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,600
You know that's bullshit,
Grassley, don't you ?

81
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,640
George Soros isn't paying people
to yell at Jeff Flake in an elevator.

82
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,080
It's unnecessary. People will
happily do that for free.

83
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,480
People would pay to yell
at Jeff Flake in an elevator.

84
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,240
If Disney World had a ride called
"Yell At Jeff Flake In An Elevator",

85
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,120
the line would be longer
than Space Mountain.

86
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,280
There was Susan Collins,
whose "yes" vote

87
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,800
should not have been
surprising to anyone.

88
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,280
She disappoints at a rate associated
with dinners cooked by divorced dads.

89
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,880
This isn't dad's special spaghetti,
it's Ragu and rice.

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,600
Give me a gummy vitamin
and let's call it a day.

91
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,560
Collins engaged in some
spectacular bad faith bullshit.

92
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,480
In announcing her "yes" vote,
she waxed indignant

93
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,840
about the "dark money" she felt
had corrupted this process.

94
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:23,560
We have seen special interest groups
whip their followers into a frenzy.

95
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,040
Interest groups have also spent
an unprecedented amount

96
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,000
of dark money
opposing this nomination.

97
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,240
Here's the thing: there was
a lot of dark money in this process.

98
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,280
An estimated $9 million was spent
on TV ads surrounding the nomination.

99
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,120
But the vast majority of that,
around $7 million,

100
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,480
was spent in support
of Kavanaugh.

101
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,960
More than half of that $7 million
came from just one group,

102
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,360
the Judicial Crisis Network,
who ran ads like this one.

103
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,160
The accusations against
Brett Kavanaugh are a smear.

104
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,920
The women who know him best
dispute them.

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,640
That's not the Brett I know.

106
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,480
Kavanaugh is a good man.

107
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,520
He never became someone
different after drinking.

108
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,480
He never ever was out of control.

109
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,000
He'd be the guy
to look out for other people.

110
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,640
It never happened.
Confirm Kavanaugh.

111
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,240
"It never happened."

112
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,840
The reason they can be sure is
that they have five whole women

113
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,880
saying
they support Kavanaugh.

114
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,160
Except not really.
'Cause it turns out,

115
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,320
this woman and this woman
are actually the same person.

116
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,480
Which is weird,
because why stop there ?

117
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,000
Why not make it look like 50 women
are vouching for Kavanaugh,

118
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,200
or 50 000, or just four tiny women
and one giant one.

119
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,080
If Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted
someone, she would have seen it.

120
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,520
She sees everything.

121
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,760
This entire process
wasn't about principle.

122
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,520
It was about getting what you want,
no matter how you have to do it,

123
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,760
or what damage it does,
to Dr. Ford, to other survivors,

124
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,560
or to our fundamental trust
in the Supreme Court.

125
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,720
It was borderline pathological.
Which brings us back to the president.

126
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,360
In Minnesota this week,
there was one moment

127
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,160
where his "win at all costs"
philosophy was laid terrifyingly bare.

128
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,720
He chose to make fun of Al Franken
who resigned from the Senate

129
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,680
after multiple accusations
of sexual misconduct.

130
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,000
Trump mocked him
not for what he'd done,

131
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,200
but for being dumb enough
to take responsibility for it.

132
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,160
I don't want to mention
Al Franken's name.

133
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,560
Ok, so I won't mention it.
He was gone. He was gone so fast !

134
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,920
It was like, he did something.
"I resign. I quit."

135
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,360
What are you making fun of ?
I did something wrong

136
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,840
and I got caught,
so now I have to leave !

137
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,640
Yes.
That's how it's supposed to go.

138
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,640
Trump has gotten away
with so much in his life,

139
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,600
for so long that he mocks
the very idea of accountability.

140
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,680
I bet in the Trump household,
the board game "Sorry !"

141
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,200
is just called "Pussy !"

142
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:09,840
Here's the thing, it worked:
and the Republicans won this week.

143
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,280
And it could take decades
to undo the damage.

144
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,800
If you are looking for where to start,
November the sixth is one month away

145
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,520
and you have a chance to deliver
the only kind of accountability

146
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,680
that matters to Trump
and his party.

147
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,320
While it is by no means
a foregone conclusion,

148
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,000
it is the only chance that we have
to look some of these people

149
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,760
and say: "goodbye".

150
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,040
And now, this.

151
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,400
Tell Weather Channel's Graphics
Department to take it down a notch.

152
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,560
It wants to rise up, as it does that,
it cools and condenses,

153
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,360
blows over the city and
it just starts puking snow.

154
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,520
You start gliding like skis,
swerving in all different directions.

155
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,720
The semi might break through the ice,
you think about multiple cars.

156
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,360
Then we run into trouble.

157
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,520
You need that
to support the weight.

158
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,080
The track at Churchill Downs
is a one mile loop.

159
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,240
I add water,
Miracle-Gro and voila,

160
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,160
we get ourselves
my favorite tree, the Maple Tree.

161
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,200
When you have
a full supermoon and a lunar eclipse,

162
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,920
we don't have that this year,
we have a new moon,

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,160
which means
it's going to be very dark.

164
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,120
When you see debris,
you know you've got a tornado.

165
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,360
Golfball size hail. Baseball size
hail. It can get up to softball size.

166
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,640
Six feet of water, imagine that.
That carries large objects in it.

167
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,280
Let me stand back ! Those
manhole covers, they can blast.

168
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,520
There could be extensive
power outagesý Air like missiles.

169
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,200
I'm grabbing my helmet
and I'm taking shelter now !

170
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:58,760
Moving on. Now, our main
story tonight concerns Brazil.

171
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,080
Home of that one famous statue
that I don't know the name of

172
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,920
'cause I'm too embarrassed to
Google "come at me bro, Jesus statue."

173
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,520
We tend to think of Brazil as
being synonymous with soccer,

174
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,000
beaches, and, of course,
the Rio carnival,

175
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,000
the celebration that has inspired
newsreel reports since the 1930s.

176
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,960
Down in Rio,
they're turning night into day.

177
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,160
It's the final day of the big carnival
and a mere couple of million Cariocas

178
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,760
are out on a great whoopee.

179
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,800
Those fun-seeking Cariocas are having
themselves a great whoopee !

180
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,320
What an excitable group of people
they are ! What a fun bunch.

181
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:39,240
I admit, the tone of British
newsreels in the past is condescending,

182
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,560
although
before you get too judgmental,

183
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,600
you might want to see
an American one from the same era.

184
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,920
Brazil itself is larger than
the whole of the United States

185
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,360
and it has millions of acres of land
no white man has ever seen.

186
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,960
That basic geography lesson
took a pretty racist turn.

187
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,200
The point is,
none of us have our hands are clean.

188
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,560
Anyway: the reason that I want
to talk about Brazil tonight

189
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,960
is that they had a massive
election today.

190
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,720
The first of two rounds, to elect,
among others, a new president

191
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,160
and while results are coming in
as we speak,

192
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,160
it is worth talking about it
for a number of reasons.

193
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,400
Brazilian politics
can be a lot of fun.

194
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,200
Broadcasters have to provide free
airtime to political parties

195
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,600
and some candidates use that airtime
to really fuck around.

196
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,760
There've been ads for
a guy dressed as a grasshopper,

197
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,320
a dancing chicken,
a small, elderly version of Robin,

198
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,640
a surprisingly healthy-looking
Osama bin Laden, Captain America,

199
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,720
a husky Spider-Man, and
my favorite, "Geraldo Wolverine".

200
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,480
I'm Geraldo Wolverine !
11232 !

201
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,440
I know what you're thinking.

202
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,720
If Hillary had just done that,
things would be different.

203
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,840
We'll never know, will we ?

204
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,560
The election has been crazy for reasons
that go beyond novelty wolverines.

205
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,000
If you think:
"Why should I care about it ?"

206
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,160
First, that's a pretty hostile
way to put it. But second:

207
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,320
Brazil is home to 200 million people,
the fifth largest country on earth.

208
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,000
They could be on the brink of massive
change, because Brazilians are pissed.

209
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,920
95 percent of them say the country
is headed in the wrong direction.

210
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,040
There is a real chance that they're
about to elect a dangerous ideologue,

211
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,720
with potentially
disastrous consequences.

212
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,360
Let us look at why that is the case.
You really need to understand

213
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,000
that Brazil is emerging from
the worst recession in its history.

214
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,880
Millions are out of work, and in some
regions, crime is out of control.

215
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,280
Last year, there were more
than 63 000 homicides in Brazil,

216
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,240
more than Europe
and the United States combined.

217
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,000
If you live in Rio, you're probably
acutely aware of that fact.

218
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,720
Thirty percent of the citizens
that live in Rio

219
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,240
was in the middle
of a crossfire once in the last year.

220
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,120
30 percent
were in the middle of crossfire.

221
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,640
Rio's weather channel should include
crossfire in their forecasts.

222
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,760
Today's cloudy, with a 30 percent
chance of a hailstorm of bullets.

223
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,360
So, maybe bring
a light flak jacket with you.

224
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,040
The general dissatisfaction about
crime has been exacerbated

225
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,160
by a corruption scandal
arising from an investigation

226
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,000
known as "Operation Car Wash".

227
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,120
I realize that that doesn't sound
like the name of a major investigation.

228
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,640
It sounds like a Netflix original
comedy starring Kevin James,

229
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,400
recommended because you watched
one episode of "Chef's Table".

230
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,840
I don't know
what your algorithm is, Netflix,

231
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,600
but I fucking hate it.

232
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,520
"Operation Car Wash" and the scandal
uncovered by it

233
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,200
is way too complicated to get into.

234
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,320
Suffice to say that it involved
this gas station, these two companies,

235
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,160
inflated contracts, bribes and
kickbacks to government officials

236
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,160
and an elderly gentleman who flew
around the world with bricks of cash,

237
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,520
strapped beneath
thigh-high socks and a Spanx-like vest.

238
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,640
Which explains this year's
hottest Halloween costume:

239
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,560
Sexy Car Wash Co-Conspirator.

240
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,960
The sheer scale of this scandal
is mind-blowing,

241
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,040
as the lead prosecutor
will tell you.

242
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,960
How does Car Wash
compare to Watergate ?

243
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,440
- Car Wash is much, much bigger.
- Bigger than Watergate ?

244
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,960
Much bigger. We already
have charged more than 200 people

245
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,720
for hundreds of crimes.

246
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,880
The amount of bribes paid
go up to about $2 billion.

247
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,960
$2 billion
and bigger than Watergate.

248
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,160
Richard Nixon must be
spinning in his grave right now.

249
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,920
Wait a second, out a bit.

250
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,840
No, he's escaped again !
He's done it again.

251
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,640
God damn it, Tricky Dick,
you're so tricky !

252
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,200
Operation Car Wash has rocked
Brazilians' faith in their government.

253
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,720
People there
are understandably disillusioned.

254
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,880
Brazil is heading towards chaos,
that is my impression.

255
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,680
Politicians are not governing.
It's a mess.

256
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,240
I'm going to cast a blank ballot,
we don't know who to vote for.

257
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,080
We put ourselves in this situation.

258
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,960
The country of the future
is the country of misery.

259
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,560
"The country of misery."

260
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,040
That's just not a phrase that
you expect to come out of Brazil.

261
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,040
A phrase you expect to be the official
tourism slogan of Great Britain.

262
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,360
Come to Britain: we promise
there will be no great whoopee.

263
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,280
Whose job will it be to try and
turn things around in Brazil ?

264
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,440
The most popular politician
in Brazil, by far, is this guy,

265
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,000
former president
Luiz Inácio Lula Da Silva.

266
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,280
He is beloved for presiding
over a period of prosperity,

267
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,240
social programs were expanded,
millions were lifted out of poverty.

268
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,320
He was running to re-take his office
and was projected to win easily.

269
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,200
There was just one minor issue.

270
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,960
One of Brazil's most influential
political figures is in police custody.

271
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,840
Former Brazilian President Luiz
Lula da Silva turned himself in

272
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,040
on Saturday to serve
a 12-year sentence for corruption.

273
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,760
Lula was caught up
in Operation Car Wash, too.

274
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,880
He claims that the charges
were politically motivated

275
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,920
and many supporters
believe him.

276
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,880
He's still so popular that polls showed
he would've won the election

277
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,240
if he'd been allowed
to run from prison.

278
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,640
Electing a president who is already
in prison for corruption does save you

279
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,320
the seemingly inevitable hassle
of having to put your president

280
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,040
in prison for corruption.

281
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,040
It's a time saver
if nothing else.

282
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,640
Since Lula is out, his party is
running Fernando Haddad in his place.

283
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,680
He's the former mayor
of Sao Paulo

284
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,720
and is generally little-known
in the rest of Brazil.

285
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,440
Instead of trying to build up
a brand of his own,

286
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,160
Haddad tried to play up
his similarity to Lula,

287
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,960
in a series of ads, it's subtle,
but just see if you can catch it.

288
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,240
Come on. That is just an insult
to people's intelligence.

289
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,120
You can't just spin a sign and
make people forget which guy is which.

290
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,960
I can't make you mix up
Gary Busey and Lucille Ball

291
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,120
by spinning a sign and going:

292
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,880
"Busey, Lucy, Busey, Lucy."

293
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,480
Because you will still know
which one is America's sweetheart

294
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,600
and which was married
to Desi Arnaz.

295
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,840
Haddad has his work cut out
for him here.

296
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,360
'Cause not only is he not Lula,
their party,

297
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,640
the Workers' Party, or PT, has been
heavily tainted by recent scandals.

298
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,600
Many Brazilians
are eager for a radical change.

299
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,560
That brings us to the man
leading in the polls: Jair Bolsonaro.

300
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,880
The nicest thing
you can say for him is:

301
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,600
he has not been implicated in
a corruption investigation, yet.

302
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,360
Unfortunately, that's the only nice
thing that I can find to say about him,

303
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,520
'cause he is
a terrible human being.

304
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,560
For a start, he's a big fan
of doing finger guns.

305
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,800
Seriously, he does this
all the fucking time.

306
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,760
There is even video
of him teaching a little girl

307
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,680
how to do them for some reason.

308
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,000
Liking finger guns
is an immediate character flaw.

309
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,000
It puts him in the august
company of Michael Scott,

310
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,440
children pretending to be cowboys
and that coworker who says

311
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,040
things like "workin' hard
or hardly workin'"

312
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,600
that everybody hates.

313
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,600
And unfortunately,
it only gets worse from there.

314
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,640
A member of the Brazilian Congress
since 1991, and known for his racist,

315
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,200
misogynistic, homophobic
and even undemocratic views,

316
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,360
Bolsonaro has cast himself
as a political outsider.

317
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,680
Offensive for most, it is his outspoken
nature that has many saying,

318
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,200
he's Brazil's version
of Donald Trump.

319
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,560
He's become known there
as "the Brazilian Trump",

320
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,640
which is both politically worrisome
and also the grossest style to order

321
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,040
at a pubic hair salon.

322
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,360
I'll take the Brazilian Trump,
please,

323
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,120
it's where you rip everything
off the front area

324
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,560
but you comb some ass hair around
to give the illusion of hair.

325
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,320
That's what it is. I'm not showing
you that, you're imagining it.

326
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,480
That's in your head. Don't be angry
with me, be angry with yourself.

327
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,160
Bolsonaro has fired up many
young people in Brazil,

328
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,200
from the middle
and upper classes.

329
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,880
There are some incredible videos
of him turning up to airports,

330
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,440
only to be mobbed by a crowd
lifting him onto their shoulders.

331
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,520
It is intense support.
It's worrying that young people

332
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,680
are so excited by him, because he is
an extreme hard-right conservative.

333
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,400
He wants to withdraw Brazil from
the Paris Agreement on climate change,

334
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,440
he's called refugees arriving in
Brazil the "scum of the world".

335
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,920
He wants to make
it easier for Brazilians to buy guns,

336
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,480
presumably so they
can fight it themselves.

337
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,520
But he also favors some psychotically
strong law enforcement, saying:

338
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,440
"a policeman who doesn't kill
isn't a policeman".

339
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,320
Which isn't even in the top-ten most
alarming statements he's made.

340
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,080
Some worry that
he'd actually go much further.

341
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,160
Bolsonaro has said in the past:
"I am in favor of a dictatorship."

342
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,160
Which is particularly worrying,
as he's a former military captain,

343
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,560
in a country that until 1985 was ruled
by a brutal military dictatorship.

344
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,680
And while that regime engaged in
torture and extrajudicial killings,

345
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,840
Bolsonaro has said that their mistake
was that they didn't go far enough.

346
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,200
I am in favor of torture, you know
that. And the people are too.

347
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,320
Through the vote you won't change
anything. Absolutely nothing !

348
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,080
It's only going to change
when we get to a civil war,

349
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,960
doing the job that the military
regime didn't do: killing 30 000 !

350
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,840
It is pretty jarring to hear someone
claim that a military dictatorship

351
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,720
didn't kill enough people.

352
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,080
Like saying Hugh Hefner didn't fuck
enough in the last days of his life.

353
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,240
Really ? I'm sure the amount he did
it was already a human rights abuse.

354
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,320
Regarding Bolsonaro's
famous homophobia and misogyny,

355
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,720
it really has to be seen
to be believed.

356
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,400
Take a look at how he once spoke
to a female member of Congress.

357
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,960
I would never rape you,
you're not worth it.

358
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,000
I hope not because
I'd slap you in the face.

359
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,320
Do it, I'll slap you back.

360
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,000
- Are you pushing me ?
- Do it, I'll slap you back.

361
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,480
He starts with "I'd never rape you,
'cause you're not worth it"

362
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,800
and then somehow manages
to top that terrible statement.

363
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,800
That's like saying: "Sorry, kids,
Christmas is cancelled this year."

364
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,120
"Why ? Because I
murdered Santa Claus."

365
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,360
Bolsonaro's homophobia
is actually even worse.

366
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,960
In interview after interview,
he has said horrifying things.

367
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,960
They want to reach our children in
order to turn children into gay adults

368
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,440
to satisfy
their sexuality in the future.

369
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,720
If your child starts
to become like that, a little gay,

370
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,040
take a whip
and change their behavior.

371
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,240
People say it's discrimination,
but you, who's watching from home,

372
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,640
would you hire a gay driver
to take your children to school ?

373
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,920
That's appalling. It's taking
all the restraint that I have

374
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,560
not to release a charmingly
illustrated children's book called

375
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,880
"Marlon Bundo Punches that
Guy Right Square In the Face."

376
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,480
If that's not bad enough,
which it already very comfortably is,

377
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,240
watch what happened when Ellen Page
went to challenge Bolsonaro.

378
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,800
I'm gay, so do you think
I should have been beaten as a child

379
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,240
to not be gay now ?

380
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,040
I'm not going to look at you and say:
"I think you're gay."

381
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,680
That doesn't matter to me.
You're very nice.

382
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,400
If I were a cadet in the military
academy and saw you on the street,

383
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,360
I would whistle at you,
you're very pretty.

384
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,880
What are you doing ?
He just told her:

385
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,360
"I wouldn't beat you,
I would catcall you"

386
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,400
and seemed to genuinely
think that was a compliment.

387
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,760
Look how confused
that made Ellen Page.

388
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,760
Do you know how hard it is
to confuse Ellen Page ?

389
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,120
She was in "Inception" !
That should be simply impossible !

390
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,400
As if Bolsonaro's campaign was
not already dramatic enough,

391
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,040
you may have heard, he was
stabbed a few weeks ago during a rally.

392
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,680
Which is horrific. Although he says
he is making a full recovery.

393
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,480
You can tell he is feeling better,
'cause when he was in hospital,

394
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,440
he pulled out
the fucking finger guns.

395
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,720
Bolsonaro's support has increased
since that attack.

396
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,160
Even Geraldo Wolverine endorsed
him, in this bizarre video.

397
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I hate what he's doing.
I love the way he's doing it.

398
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,200
Why is Wolverine
endorsing Bolsonaro ? I don't know.

399
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,680
Why does he seem to
be driving a Ford Focus ?

400
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,440
There's lot of questions
that that video raises

401
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,800
and I just don't have
the answers to any.

402
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,480
There may be
some small reason for hope here.

403
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,640
A huge movement has emerged
called "Ele Nao" or not him.

404
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,520
There have been massive marches
against Bolsonaro all over Brazil.

405
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,520
And as you have seen tonight,

406
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,240
voting for "not him"
is a truly excellent idea.

407
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,560
Today's election was supposed
to just determine who went

408
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,120
into a two-person runoff
on October 28th.

409
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,680
If any candidate got
50 percent or above,

410
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,840
there would be
no second round.

411
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,280
They would just be
Brazil's president.

412
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,560
As of right now, the vote tally shows
Bolsonaro at around 48 percent,

413
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,800
with over three-quarters
of the votes counted.

414
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,960
While he will probably go
to a runoff with Haddad,

415
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,280
there is still a chance
he's going to win outright tonight.

416
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,120
Why wouldn't that happen ?
Between taping this show and airtime,

417
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,680
Bolsonaro could have won,

418
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,520
Ruth Bader Ginsburg could
have been eaten by a bear

419
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,600
and every kitten's paws could have
been replaced by octopus tentacles.

420
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,320
Possible,
it seems that's what life is now.

421
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,760
If Bolsonaro has not won,
if there is going to be a runoff,

422
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,640
then it's still, it isn't too late.

423
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:33,680
Brazil, please look: you are disgusted
with your politics at the moment.

424
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,720
And you're not inspired
by any of the alternatives.

425
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,160
But anything is better than
Bolsonaro. Diet Lula is better.

426
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,680
Spider-Man is better.
Gary Busey is better.

427
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,800
That is Gary Busey,
I'm pretty sure that's him.

428
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,360
Bolsonaro does not reflect the best
of who you are, Brazil.

429
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,680
And with any luck, you still have
a chance to vote "Ele Nao".

430
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:59,640
And not let this man fingerbang
your democracy. And now this.

431
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,440
Scenes From
Sean Hannity's Midlife Crisis.

432
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,000
I train an hour and a half a day,
mixed martial arts. I fight.

433
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,880
I have been
doing mixed martial arts training.

434
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,040
Sean Hannity is getting
good at martial arts.

435
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,880
I'm doing martial arts. To me,
this is like my martial arts training.

436
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,880
I get up early, I do my martial arts.
And this is my fist, pan in on that.

437
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,720
I do stick training, I do
blade training, firearm training.

438
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,280
You don't know how you're
gonna react in a situation,

439
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,080
but I train for that moment.

440
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,160
You and I would rush
them together.

441
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,760
You're either all in, it's all out war,
or you're not in at all.

442
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,520
I can now do
a hundred pushups, hundred sit-ups

443
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,040
and I'm boxing and punching and
learning street martial arts.

444
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,120
I never will start a fight, but if
somebody starts a fight with me,

445
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,800
I'm gonna finish the fight.

446
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,720
That's our show.
See you next week, goodnight !

447
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,920
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

448
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,080
END OF EPISODE 25,
SEASON V
