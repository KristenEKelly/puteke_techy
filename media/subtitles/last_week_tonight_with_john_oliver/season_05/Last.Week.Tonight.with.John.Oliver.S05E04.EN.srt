00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,880
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,360
SEASON V
EPISODE 4

3
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,720
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,520
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,840
A quick recap of the week.
We begin with the Trump White House.

6
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,400
Where every morning Jared Kushner
slams a door and yells:

7
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,400
"You' don't have clearance
to hear 'my' secrets !"

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,600
Another head-spinning week,
from the departure of Gary Cohn,

9
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,600
to the saga of Stormy Daniels,
to the announcement on Thursday,

10
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,240
that Trump had agreed to
a historic summit with Kim Jong Un.

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,280
This seemingly
came out of nowhere.

12
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,000
South Korean officials delivered him
a message that Kim Jong Un

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,280
was open to a meeting
and this happened.

14
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,560
Trump interrupted a conversation
between South Korean officials

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,320
and said:
"OK...Tell them I'll do it."

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,120
South Korean officials looked
at each other as if in disbelief,

17
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,280
according to a White House official:
"Tell him yes", the president said.

18
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,920
And that was it !

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,920
Trump broke with decades of precedent
like taking a sample at Costco.

20
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,080
Salmon jerky ?
Fuck it, let's do it.

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,760
If I don't like it, it's not
like it's the end of the world.

22
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,960
Who knows if this summit
is even going to happen ?

23
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,960
Because nothing Trump
says means anything.

24
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,320
But what that North Korean news did
is distract from something else,

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,600
that was International Women's Day.

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,160
That one special day a year
for half the people of earth.

27
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,640
Knock yourselves out,
three and a half billion people !

28
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,400
It was a day of marches,
in support of causes

29
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,240
from equal pay
to combating sexual harassment.

30
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,000
All of which were truly inspiring.
What was dispiriting was that,

31
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,880
Women's Day inspired reactions
from the clumsy to the appalling.

32
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,840
Starting with the efforts of brands
trying to appear progressive feminists.

33
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,120
McDonalds turned its "M"
upside down, for women,

34
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,400
because I guess the "M"
is for men the rest of the time,

35
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,280
Porsche blacked out the letters
in their logo until it read "she"

36
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,560
and then there was Brawny, who
ran a "Who's Your Shero ?" campaign.

37
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,120
Brawny celebrates sheroes
this Women's History Month

38
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,320
and supports Girls Inc. to inspire
sheroes of tomorrow.

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,520
Who's your shero ?

40
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,000
We consulted some
linguistics experts

41
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,080
and it turns out there's
already a word for "women's heroes".

42
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,200
Heroes.
It's a little like the word "sheroes"

43
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,640
only it's not stupid
and it is a word.

44
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,160
Mattel fared better with their line
of "inspiring women" Barbie dolls.

45
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,760
One local newscaster
found a way to make it creepy.

46
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,920
The three inspiring women dolls
are aviator Amelia Earhart,

47
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,840
artist Frida Kahlo and mathematician
Katherine Johnson.

48
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,240
I love the Frida Kahlo one.
She's dressed... Love it.

49
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,160
- Salma Hayek, the movie ?
- You like that movie yeah ?

50
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,320
- I like Salma.
- You like Salma, ok.

51
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,600
It was a segment about women's
empowerment, children's toys

52
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,920
and a long-dead artist,
but he decided:

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,080
"I 'can' perv out on this.
I 'will' perv out on this."

54
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,560
"I will make this Women's Day
segment about my dick !"

55
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,640
That was not the only
awkward interaction at a TV news desk.

56
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,920
Step forward, CBS This Morning,
a show that fired Charlie Rose

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,520
following sexual harassment
allegations.

58
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,120
They transitioned from a segment
about dog behavior to a segment

59
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,880
about International
Women's Day like this.

60
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,560
Researchers says it's kind
of like speaking to your dog

61
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,640
the way you do to a baby,
but don't mistake the two.

62
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,680
Come here, you little sweetie pie,
don't you look so cute.

63
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,480
I want to be in your lap, Norah.

64
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,000
You know you two are not alone ?
There's people in the room.

65
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,440
Gayle's right:
there are people in the room.

66
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,320
We should focus on who's
"not" in the room.

67
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,640
Who is "not" in that room and how
did he come to be not in the room ?

68
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,520
"CBS This Morning" is less
a morning show and more

69
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,320
"incriminating office
surveillance footage"

70
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,400
"that gets broadcast across
the country every day."

71
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,400
Some news anchors were spending
the entire day acting inappropriately.

72
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,680
Like Mike Jerrick. We don't have
time to show you everything he did,

73
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,040
this is just a sample of what
he got up to on Thursday.

74
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,320
Have a great day International Women.
Why do you need your own day ?

75
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,920
They changed the Brawny
dude to a woman... Yeah.

76
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:14,040
How could we change that into
something good to celebrate women ?

77
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,360
It's great, you'll love it.
How do you keep your girlish figure ?

78
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,680
- Ever cheated on your husband ?
- No.

79
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,040
Last time you had sex ?

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,400
- It's the Alex Holley.
- Turn it around...

81
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,800
It's so authentic
it has a mic pack on it.

82
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,560
What do you do with this doll
that you have at home ?

83
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,960
I put it by my bedside, so I can
wake up open my eyes and see you.

84
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,920
That is gross.

85
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,320
We should all now take a shower,
but I feel like Mike Jerrick would say:

86
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,600
"noice".

87
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,840
But the worst moments
were from male politicians.

88
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,760
Boris Johnson, Foreign Secretary
and dumpy Swedish Beatle,

89
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,640
celebrated by visiting schoolchildren,
a perfectly pleasant idea.

90
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,400
The subject of Cleopatra
apparently came up

91
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,200
and Johnson decided to tell
the kids how she died.

92
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,480
She gets some snakes
brought in in a basket of figs

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,240
and she wanted to commit suicide
because Antony was dead.

94
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,280
She loved Antony. And so she took out
the snake which was called an asp

95
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,280
and she put it on her bosom
and then she died.

96
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,400
That was the end of Cleopatra.

97
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,120
What are you doing ? I would
watch hours of Boris Johnson

98
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,000
explaining grim endings
to distracted children.

99
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,880
Sara loses her mind,
Harry has his arm amputated

100
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,320
and Marion performs
a sex show for drugs.

101
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,480
And that was the end of
"Requiem For A Dream", children.

102
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,720
Kudos to that one kid who gave him
a thumbs-up at the end of the story.

103
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,800
Can't wait to go home and ask my mom
what bosoms and suicide are.

104
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,440
Who better to end this roundup
than Vladimir Putin ?

105
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,440
In his annual speech,
he decided to read a Russian love poem

106
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,440
that featured some
truly unfortunate sentiments.

107
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,000
It is a woman's soul
that conquers us.

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,200
When she is young,
when she's a mother

109
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,640
And even when her hair goes gray.

110
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,560
"Even when her hair goes gray."
That is both a bizarre sentiment

111
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,480
and a weird summary
of any woman's life.

112
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,800
First she is child, then she makes
child, then she changes color.

113
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,840
She is like banana,
if banana make other bananas.

114
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,160
Happy International Women's Day,
you eternally fuckable bananas.

115
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,720
In the unlikely event that Vladimir
Putin loses his upcoming election,

116
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,800
there might be a morning news job
in Philly he would be perfect for.

117
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,200
And now this...

118
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,320
An MSNBC guest brought on to
discuss Gary Cohn's departure

119
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,880
can't get over
the "Bachelor" finale.

120
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,520
It comes down to two women,
tells one he loves her

121
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,640
but he's gonna pick the other one
and she cries in the limousine,

122
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,480
then he picks the other one.

123
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,400
There's the blonde and the brunette
so he picks the brunette,

124
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,200
he proposes to her,
gets down on one knee

125
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,760
and then it goes to the host
Chris Harrison who says:

126
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,040
"but this is not
the end of the story."

127
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,920
The bachelor says he can't stop
thinking about the blonde.

128
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,160
And then the brunette comes
to spend a weekend with him

129
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,760
in some house they rented
for them in Los Angeles.

130
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,120
They say this is the most dramatic
thing in Bachelor history

131
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,400
we're gonna show you, they had
a camera on him a camera on her.

132
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,880
And he says to her...
I'm breaking up with you.

133
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,960
For 20 minutes, America
watched Becca, the brunette, cry.

134
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:09,640
Cry and cry and feel humiliated
and cry and say go away

135
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,600
and then he wouldn't go away...

136
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,200
Moving on. Our main story
concerns technology.

137
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,440
The thing that will eventually
make television so HiDef,

138
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,880
I will no longer be allowed
to appear on it.

139
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,880
I want to approach this carefully,
discussions of any new technology

140
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,720
tend to age badly, as this news report
from less than five years ago shows.

141
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,720
The first users of Google Glasses
will not be the last.

142
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,480
It'll end up changing our lifestyles,
the way we interact.

143
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,520
And just changing the gesture.
Instead of this, it will be that.

144
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,840
Yeah, it wasn't though.
It was not that.

145
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,520
People didn't mind doing this
if the alternative

146
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,840
was wearing a stupid robot
on their face.

147
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,840
It is dangerous to make predictions
about where tech is going.

148
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,960
Tonight, we're going to talk
about cryptocurrencies.

149
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,640
All you don't understand
about money combined

150
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,400
with all you
don't understand about computers.

151
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,720
The main currency you've
heard about is Bitcoin.

152
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,600
It's been all over the news,
because last year, its value exploded,

153
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,840
from around $1 000,
to $9 000 by November,

154
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,280
to nearly $20 000 by December.

155
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,360
Bitcoin became such a hot topic,
paparazzi asked celebrities about it.

156
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,000
Watch Michael Keaton
leaving a restaurant.

157
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,880
See you guys, take care.

158
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,280
Would you
recommend buying bitcoin ?

159
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,000
I was just talking to my buddy,
who knows about this.

160
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,600
One guy said:
"yeah, you probably want to."

161
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,480
Another friend of mine said...

162
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,800
Not like a bad thing, they
don't know where it's gonna go.

163
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,480
You do not expect conversations with
paparazzi to be so nuanced.

164
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,480
Cardi B ! What are your thoughts
on the idea of universal basic income ?

165
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,120
It could go a long way
to reducing inequality,

166
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,720
but I don't think the Americans
would support the tax increase.

167
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,160
Read in: "Cardinomics: Making Money
Moves For A New American Century"

168
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,280
This was a dramatic shift,
you'd only hear about Bitcoin

169
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,880
from that one guy in your office
who wouldn't shut up about it.

170
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,080
Let's call him "Dan".
We're calling him "Dan"

171
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,880
because Dan is the exact guy
in our office

172
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,160
who's been annoying everybody with
his "you gotta get into Bitcoin" shit.

173
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,800
This is why we hate Dan.
It's not the only reason,

174
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,440
but it's the easiest one
to bring up right now.

175
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:50,000
Lately, more and more normal
people, or "non-Dans",

176
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,800
got into cryptocurrencies,
after stories like this.

177
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,200
Dylan Fine is living the dream.

178
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,600
I had that Mitsubishi Eclipse.
My AC didn't work, right ?

179
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,960
I had to open my door
to get food at the drive-through.

180
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,360
Everything changed when
a friend introduced him to Bitcoin.

181
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,320
I turned 350 dollars
into 12 000.

182
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,240
He became a millionaire at 24
by investing in Bitcoin.

183
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,440
I can put in a trade, wait,
let the exchange rate fluctuate

184
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,640
and I'm able to profit from
the world's largest financial market.

185
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,160
That man is apparently a millionaire,
why he's being interviewed

186
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,560
on the most expensive outdoor
swamp log in South Florida.

187
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,640
Despite the fact that Bitcoin dropped
by half since the start of this year,

188
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:42,360
there is still a cryptocurrency fervor,
with people watching people get rich

189
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,080
or hearing about others
on Reddit or Twitter

190
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,560
and feeling driven to invest in crypto,
due to FOMO

191
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,520
or "fear of missing out".

192
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,600
FOMO is a term that many of you
already knew about,

193
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,360
but I'm forty years old, British
and oblivious, or "FYOBO."

194
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,520
With all this excitement, we'd try
and explain a few things tonight:

195
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,800
Bitcoin, blockchain, the technology
that allows it to exist,

196
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,920
and cryptocurrencies in general.

197
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,920
I'm going to be simplifying things.
So let's start with Bitcoin,

198
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,720
which is a digital,
decentralized currency.

199
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,440
Bitcoin only exists as computer code

200
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,000
and there is no bank or government
creating or controlling it.

201
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,520
This is already a little
hard to understand,

202
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,880
so I'll let this man in a Bitcoin suit
give you a decent explanation.

203
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,600
I'm a virtual currency. Worldwide,
you can send for little to no fees,

204
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,000
open-source,
not controlled by any government,

205
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,720
corporation or individual,
it's financial freedom, bro.

206
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,560
Thanks, bro. That is a nuanced
and accurate explanation of a topic

207
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,480
delivered with the help
of a man in a stupid costume.

208
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,080
I would make fun of that,

209
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,760
except it's the entire business model
of this television show.

210
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,440
You may be thinking, but: "How
do you make money from Bitcoin ?"

211
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,120
Dan would say: "You trade it on
exchanges, like any other currency."

212
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,880
And if you then asked,
how does it have value ?

213
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,680
Dan would say: "How does
any money have value, man ?"

214
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,720
And then he'd say:
"Call me the brain-fellater,"

215
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,080
"'cause I just blew
your fucking mind."

216
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,920
Forget I asked, Dan. You're
absolutely gross. I hate you.

217
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,440
But the problem is,
Dan is kind of right.

218
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,960
Like most currencies,
the reason that Bitcoin has value

219
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,560
is because people agree
it has value.

220
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,440
It's really being treated more like
speculative investment than a currency.

221
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,640
Think of it like
Beanie Babies.

222
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:48,800
Why is this Beanie Baby being
for sale at a price of $15 000 ?

223
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,080
Its owner thinks that someone
will pay that for it.

224
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,760
That owner was absolutely right.
I'm kidding.

225
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,000
I bought this at a yard sale
for $10 000.

226
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,120
I'm not a complete idiot.

227
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,960
Bitcoin is interesting as a concept,
there are complicated technical issues

228
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,120
to work out before
it can become a usable currency.

229
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,920
Look what happened in January.

230
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,680
Hundreds are in Miami
for a Bitcoin conference

231
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,600
but it had to stop taking Bitcoin
as a payment for tickets last week,

232
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,680
there are still kinks
to work out with the currency.

233
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,480
It's true, a Bitcoin conference
stopped taking Bitcoin.

234
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,520
Which is a red flag, that's the one
place you'd think it would be accepted.

235
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,680
Like when I tried to pay for access
to the Republican National Convention

236
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,280
using Ronald Reagan's
dusty skeleton bones.

237
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,000
Everyone agreed they had value,
there wasn't an adequate network

238
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,360
for the completion
of our transaction.

239
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:54,000
Whether Bitcoin catches on or not,
many believe the exciting thing

240
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,680
is the potential of the innovative
technology that it's built on,

241
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,720
something called "blockchain".

242
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,200
If I wanted to send money
to someone across the world,

243
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,960
a bank would verify that transaction
and it could take days.

244
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,240
With Bitcoin, it is vastly faster,
no bank is involved.

245
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,200
Because blockchain technology
allows a record or a ledger

246
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,320
of every Bitcoin transaction
to be stored, not in one place,

247
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,160
but across vast numbers
of computers.

248
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,240
That is part of what people mean
when say Bitcoin is "decentralized"

249
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:33,120
and decentralization has advantages,
from speed to security.

250
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,960
The key point here is that
this is a distributed ledger.

251
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,680
There is no central survey.
All the other ledgers that we have,

252
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,120
they all sit and reside
inside that company,

253
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,560
which means they have one point
of attack, they can be hacked,

254
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,720
JP Morgan was hacked
by cyber thieves not so long ago,

255
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,040
Home Depot, Target, we've had
these companies get hacked

256
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,360
because there's one central
repository of information.

257
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,920
Bitcoin ledger resides on
thousands of computers.

258
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,680
You can't hack that.

259
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,960
Sounds great.

260
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,200
Because of the complicated process
the network uses, it is very secure.

261
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,680
I'm not going to get into what that
process is, or how it works,

262
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,880
but I will share a really dumb
metaphor for why it is safe.

263
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,480
The way I like to think of it is that
a blockchain is a processed thing,

264
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,080
sort of like a Chicken McNugget
and if you wanted to hack it,

265
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,520
it'd be like turning a Chicken McNugget
back into a chicken.

266
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,680
Someday, someone will do that,
but now it's going to be tough.

267
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,560
That is a horrible thought,
why is that reporter so happy ?

268
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,560
If anyone figures out how to turn a
Chicken McNugget back into a chicken,

269
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,520
that chicken
is going to be fucked up.

270
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:00,280
He'll be suffering from PTSD and
writing poetry about the experience.

271
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,720
The things I saw...

272
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,000
My body is whole,
But what of my soul ?

273
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,760
That is the blockchain: a database
impossible to hack or tamper with

274
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,320
and which could improve security,
efficiency and trust.

275
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,640
Big companies like Walmart, IBM
and JP Morgan have been experimenting

276
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,680
as a way to potentially share
and secure data

277
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,080
and transactions in a reliable,
easy to access way.

278
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,960
No one yet knows what blockchain
is really capable of.

279
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,480
Don't worry if you still don't
understand. Most people don't.

280
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,520
Dan thinks he does, he'll throw around
terms like "supply chain management"

281
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,120
and it makes me want
to punch him in his face.

282
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,920
Stop leaving printouts of Reddit
threads on my desk, Dan !

283
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,440
I'm just throwing them away !
I hate you !

284
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,960
There is enough excitement around
the very word "blockchain"

285
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,440
that it's become
a magnet for investment.

286
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,800
Reuters found that the existing
companies that merely added

287
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,240
the word blockchain to their name
saw their stock price

288
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,080
increase more than threefold
and one was particularly dumb.

289
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,240
Long Island Iced Tea renamed
themselves long blockchain.

290
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,040
Guess what happened ?
Yeah, their stock tripled.

291
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:29,240
To people who watch markets. Seems
so stupid it's not worth reporting.

292
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,240
I don't care how stupid it is,
it works.

293
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,760
This show will be called "Last Bit
Tonight With Block Chainiver."

294
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,520
Triple the ratings ! Triple !
Take that to the bank !

295
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,120
At this point you know basically
what Bitcoin is...

296
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,840
It's the future, bro. And why
people are excited about blockchain:

297
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,280
it won't let people
chicken up your nuggs.

298
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,840
You might still be wondering: what
about all the other cryptocurrencies ?

299
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,640
The key software to create
a coin is open-source,

300
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,640
anyone can create one,
so they have done that.

301
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,400
There are over 1 500 cryptocurrencies
that you can buy, with names

302
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,640
like Titcoin, Trumpcoin, Jesuscoin,
Insanecoin, Electroneum, Wax, Particl,

303
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,360
Deep Onion, Snovio,
Pluton, NuBits and Clams.

304
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,800
So insane, you can't tell which ones
are real and which I made up,

305
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,400
they're all real,
I didn't make any up,

306
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,840
I tried to come up with a dumber
name than "Deep Onion"

307
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,240
and it can't be done.

308
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,880
Not all are like Bitcoin,
hoping to be the next currency.

309
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,240
Startup companies will sell a coin
to try and raise money,

310
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,560
as an alternative to issuing stock.

311
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,920
Sometimes,
those coins are meant as tokens,

312
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,600
to be used for services that startup
might eventually provide.

313
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,080
Kind of like the tokens at Chuck
E. Cheese, only virtual

314
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,880
and not redeemable
at a rat-based food emporium.

315
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:11,200
It has become easy to issue coins
so companies are doing it a lot.

316
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:17,080
Initial coin offerings, or ICO's,
raised over $6 billion in 2017,

317
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,400
with one company raising $35
million in under 30 seconds.

318
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,360
When someone makes that
much money that fast,

319
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,920
they did it by walking up
to Bill O'Reilly,

320
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,400
sitting in silence for 26 seconds,
saying: "I recorded our phone calls."

321
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:38,680
But the vast majority of people
buying coins are not paying attention

322
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,680
to the details of the startups
they're attached to.

323
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,520
They are just responding
to the huge fervor.

324
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,960
There's an entire online
subculture of YouTube personalities

325
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,120
and sub-Reddits for having a cult-like
devotion to buying these coins.

326
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,320
You'll find they have
a whole shorthand.

327
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,040
One key term is "hodl", based
on a misspelling of "hold".

328
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,400
This is a foundational principle:
don't sell when prices drop.

329
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,120
"Hodl" in the face of "FUD":
"fear, uncertainty and doubt."

330
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,640
You might miss out when the coin
"moons", or rockets up in value,

331
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,360
you'll get "rekt"
or lose money

332
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,520
and never be able to afford
the traders' ultimate goal:

333
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,040
a "lambo," which is short for,
Lamborghini,

334
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,680
because of course it is.

335
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:32,200
If you are thinking these terms belong
in a rap video, some traders agree.

336
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,800
Throw your hands in the air man.
If you're d-down with the blockchain.

337
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,280
I ain't got time for the haters.
We about to grow to a million.

338
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,240
Hodl gang... Tell me
are you down with the crypto ?

339
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,280
Hodl gang...

340
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,120
Cool.
And I've got to be honest there,

341
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,120
it is hard not to watch that and
deep down want to be in

342
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,080
the hodl gang,
hodl gang...

343
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,680
Many are buying coins because
other people are buying them.

344
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:10,920
Even a coin started as a joke, like
Dogecoin, can rocket up in value.

345
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,960
It's named after an internet meme
that was popular at the time.

346
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,560
A photo of a shiba inu with comments
written in broken English around it.

347
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:26,640
Dogecoin's total market value
has almost doubled, to over $2 billion.

348
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,800
There appear to be
no obvious reasons for this.

349
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,080
Yeah, because there were
no obvious reasons.

350
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,880
The whole point was to make fun
of how people will buy anything.

351
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,120
People did exactly that.
That is no less ridiculous than

352
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,560
if you started a joke band after
Beatles called The Woofles,

353
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,960
all St. Bernard's, and they went
on to have 40 #1 hits

354
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,840
and were knighted by the Queen.

355
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,800
This is clearly ridiculous,
but for investors, it's also dangerous.

356
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,480
This market is the Wild West
and ripe for exploitation.

357
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:03,360
It's easy to manipulate the value of
coins through pump-and-dump schemes.

358
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,000
Regulators crack down on those
with stocks,

359
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,440
but they acted slower
in the crypto market.

360
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,560
That may explain why
some groups have felt comfortable

361
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,200
posting videos like this.

362
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,240
Welcome to Crypto Callz,
a leading cryptocurrency pump group,

363
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,680
where we skyrocket the value
of coins for six hours at a time.

364
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,080
For information
about our weekly pumps,

365
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,760
follow our Telegram channel.

366
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,120
Once released,
buy the coin as quickly as possible.

367
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,200
When everyone in the group
has purchased the coin,

368
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,880
we will begin advertising it to
other investors on social media.

369
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,760
Outside investors will fill our orders
as they "FOMO" into the coin

370
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,800
that we have increased in value
1 000 to 2 000 percent.

371
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,200
The six hours are up, everyone
in our group will have sold for profit.

372
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,000
Crypto Callz: together, we profit.

373
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,040
Holy shit !
It's kind of destabilizing to see

374
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,800
an advertisement for something
you could have sworn was illegal.

375
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,360
It's like watching a
commercial and hearing:

376
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,400
Do you not have a child ?
Do you want somebody else's ?

377
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,160
Then Kidnappers' Korner
is the group for you !

378
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,320
We take children that are not ours
and bring them home with us !

379
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,800
It's "easy peasy
toddler-seizey !"

380
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,800
Pump-and-dumps are the beginning.
There are dodgy companies,

381
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,400
some look like old-school frauds
with crypto sauce on top.

382
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,600
Take Bitconnect. It was worth
three billion dollars.

383
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,960
Bitconnect told investors that,
if they handed over money,

384
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,120
they could get returns
as 40% a month.

385
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,360
And a rate of return that high
may seem suspicious to you,

386
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,840
but the market was soaring and
Bitconnect had excited investors,

387
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,600
like this guy who spoke
at one of the conferences.

388
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,880
Wassup ? Bitconnect !

389
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,280
Let me tell you that we are
changing the world as we know it.

390
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,320
The world is not anymore
the way it used to be. No !

391
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,760
Bitconnect !

392
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,760
Bitconnect !

393
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,920
I love...

394
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,880
Bitconnect !

395
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,800
Yes, the last time I saw someone
that irrationally exuberant,

396
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,800
he was roughly seven years
away from divorcing Katie Holmes.

397
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,160
I don't blame him.
He's got a good head on his shoulders.

398
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,920
You stay clear, Tommy.
Stay clear, my boy.

399
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,280
That man's passion has become
famous in the crypto world,

400
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,720
as well as his conviction that
the business was 100% legit.

401
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,040
I am saying to so many people
who say that this was going to be

402
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,280
a con artist game,
a scammer game:

403
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,400
you're gonna lose all your money,
my wife still doesn't believe in me !

404
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,160
I tell her:
"Honey, look, this is real."

405
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,120
No, that's a scam.

406
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,760
I said to myself: "When I started
to put ten thousand dollars a day

407
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,480
on her table,
then she's gonna say....

408
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,280
Women ! Always nagging you not to
get sucked into get-rich-quick schemes,

409
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,440
leaving your marriage
in a state of financial ruin.

410
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,840
Bitconnect !

411
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,040
This will not surprise you:
Bitconnect essentially collapsed.

412
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,520
Regulators in two states
issued cease-and-desist orders

413
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,040
and Bitconnect's reportedly
been labeled a Ponzi scheme.

414
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,440
Something nobody suspected
from their promotional material,

415
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,480
except it featured this illustration
of their bonus system.

416
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,600
A picture of a man coming up
with the idea for a pyramid scheme.

417
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,840
I am not saying that
every crypto coin is a scam.

418
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,200
I'm not saying that every
blockchain company is bullshit.

419
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,680
In a speculative mania,

420
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,240
it can be incredibly hard
to tell which companies are for real.

421
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:14,280
Look at block.one, a startup whose
coin offering has so far raised

422
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:20,080
$1.5 billion, which will go toward
developing a software project, EOS.

423
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,000
It took Facebook seven years to raise
a billion dollars from investors.

424
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,680
It took Uber five years.
EOS surpassed that in nine months.

425
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,720
Despite the Wall Street Journal
described block one

426
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,240
as "a software startup that
doesn't plan to sell any software"

427
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,880
and describes what it's selling
as having "no purpose".

428
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,720
While the company insists
that EOS will be

429
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,800
"the most powerful infrastructure
for decentralized applications",

430
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,760
which they say will
be "usable",

431
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,080
it hasn't launched yet.

432
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,200
You have to take their word
for it. And they do talk a big game.

433
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,680
Everything will be better,
faster and cheaper.

434
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,640
Everything will be
more connected.

435
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,000
Everything will be more trustworthy,
more secure.

436
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,760
Everything that exists
is no longer going to exist

437
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,760
in the way that it does today.

438
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,520
Everything in this world
is about to get better.

439
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,720
Please, douche. Everything will no
longer exist in the way it does ?

440
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,600
How is EOS going
to change this iguana ?

441
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,560
How is EOS going to both alter
and improve, Susan, here ?

442
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,600
Susan is enough !

443
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,240
That sleepy creepy cowboy from
the future is named Brock Pierce.

444
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,240
He began his career appearing
in "The Mighty Ducks"

445
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,960
and in a Gushers commercial as
a child who turns into a banana.

446
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,600
That banana got involved
with unsavory figures.

447
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,720
Google "Brock Pierce scandal"
is all I'm saying there

448
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,520
and he teamed up with EOS to help
promote their not-yeta-product.

449
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,840
He gave a speech at a tech conference,
and remember as you listen:

450
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,360
the company he's describing
has raised $1.5 billion.

451
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,400
This is a Chestahedron that I'm wearing
which is the logo of EOS.

452
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,440
The Chestahedron is the sacred
geometrical shape of the heart.

453
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,520
If you're gonna bring a technology that
has the potential to change everything,

454
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,600
it's good when you do it with intention
and seems a good place to begin.

455
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:31,400
This was my wedding.
An entirely unicorn wedding.

456
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,200
All the groomsmen wore the color
of the rainbow plus pink.

457
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:40,560
And my best man was a woman
dressed in black, cracking a whip.

458
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:46,240
Stop, Brock. Stop.
I was already out at Chestahedron,

459
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,680
and I refuse to believe that a man
who organize a unicorn wedding

460
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,000
should be trusted around
one and a half billion dollars.

461
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,680
If someone mowed your lawn
and gave you that speech,

462
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,360
you would tell:
"I don't trust you with my lawn."

463
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,520
You're gonna organize
a warlock quinceanera on it.

464
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,160
At the start, I said that I didn't
want to make predictions.

465
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,000
Maybe EOS is going to be the next
Google. I don't think it is.

466
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,960
I don't think it can be worth over
a billion dollars at this point.

467
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,440
But I could be wrong.
I'm not, but I could be.

468
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,960
If you choose to invest
in the cryptocurrency space,

469
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,640
know you're not investing,
you're gambling.

470
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,160
You should know that is what
you're doing. Prices do go down.

471
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,040
Bitcoin could be worthless.
Or it could be worth billions

472
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,200
and adopted
as a new global currency.

473
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,960
If that does happen,
I will not experience it,

474
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:47,200
I'll be in an bunker, trying to avoid
Dan's smug little face.

475
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,320
I hate your belt more than
anything else in that photo.

476
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,760
This is a new space and nobody
knows how it's going to develop.

477
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,840
So you need to be careful.
I know that that sounds boring,

478
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,960
caution is a tough sell when you're
up against Bitconnect and hodl gang.

479
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,760
I have invited a special guest to
help make that message more exciting.

480
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,280
Wassup ?

481
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:43,240
I'm so thrilled right now to be
sharing this, super exciting,

482
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,840
hunky-dory, Magic Mike
moment with all of you !

483
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,920
Tonight, we're going to be talking
about: responsibility !

484
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,320
Responsibility. Tell me more
about this responsibility.

485
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,760
I shouldn't throw everything I own
into cryptocurrencies ?

486
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,160
- That's right, John.
- I shouldn't do it ?

487
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,200
- No !
- That's a no ?

488
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,040
- That's a no.
- That's a hard no.

489
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,720
The crypto market is volatile
and insufficiently regulated.

490
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,760
They pump they dump.
They pump 'n dump...

491
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,720
- Pumpin' it and dumpin' it...
- It's true.

492
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,760
They pump and dump...

493
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,560
- All the time.
- And they dump.

494
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,720
- Yes.
- They dump.

495
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,760
Listen up bitties and gentlecoins,
investing in crypto could be

496
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,320
like getting in on Google
on the ground floor.

497
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:48,640
Hold on wait ! When you say that,
that sounds absolutely great.

498
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,520
Or it could be like getting in on
Google Glass on the ground floor !

499
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,800
That turned out to be:
a one-story building !

500
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:02,040
That was a single story.
What is the big lesson here ?

501
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,600
Never invest any more
than you're willing to lose !

502
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,560
And if you do,
don't just blindly "hodl" !

503
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:15,680
Instead, you have to be
extremely craeful, ok ?

504
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,880
Have to be craeful.
Hashtag "craefulgang" !

505
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,280
Craefulgang !

506
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,480
Craefulgang, I love it.

507

508
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,520
Craefulgang !

509
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,360
He makes some good points.
You make a good point.

510
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,320
I make a good point.

511
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,360
Responsibility !

512
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,280
