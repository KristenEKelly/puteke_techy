00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,840
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

2
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,480
SEASON V
EPISODE 16

3
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,800
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

4
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,760
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

5
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,680
A quick recap of the week.
We begin with President Trump,

6
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,920
the abusive father US will be talking
about in therapy for the next 40 years.

7
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,920
This week saw continued outrage
over his zero-tolerance policy

8
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,680
causing families
to be separated at the border.

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,840
A policy which Trump insisted
he had no power to change.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,400
His hands were tied. There was nothing
he could do. Guess what ?

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,280
President Trump today ordered
an end to the policy

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,040
of separating migrant families
who enter the country illegally.

13
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,400
Trump claimed he couldn't do
a thing and then he did it.

14
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,320
He usually claims he can do things
and then doesn't do them,

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,680
like draining the swamp,
or locking up Hillary,

16
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,000
or attending
Tiffany's Sweet Sixteen.

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,880
It's been eight years, Tiff.
Time to leave the Radisson.

18
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,840
That order has some hitches.
While families will not be separated,

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,560
that's because
they'll be detained together.

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,680
Children can't be held in detention
facilities for more than 20 days.

21
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,160
Less than three weeks from now,
they could split families up again.

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,880
Those 2 000 children who have been
separated from their parents,

23
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,160
what is the plan
to deal with them ?

24
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,160
Trump administration released a plan
for bringing families together.

25
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,920
Major pieces are still missing,
including a clear timeline

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,680
on just how long it would take
and how it would get done.

27
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,240
Hold on, those are some pretty
major pieces to leave out.

28
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,240
In fact, it's all the pieces.
"How long it will take"

29
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,960
and "how it will get done"
are the whole plan.

30
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,480
That's like a recipe for cake that
says: "you're going to have some cake."

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,880
How was this passed down from
your grandmother ? This is nothing.

32
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,760
The notable thing was the lengths
some Trump supporters went to defend

33
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,560
the indefensible from "their parents
shouldn't have broken the law"

34
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,560
to "conditions aren't that bad".

35
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,640
It took Fox's Stuart Varney to go
with "who gives a shit" ?

36
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,160
If you read the headlines,
or you the watch the evening news

37
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,440
it's trade war,
it's children in cages.

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,520
The real big story
that affects everybody in America,

39
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,960
is the success
of the president's tax-cut package

40
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,880
and what it's done for our economy.

41
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,640
Why are we talking about this ? We
should be talking about something else.

42
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,000
That deflection technique
doesn't work

43
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,400
when the thing you're deflecting
from is children in cages.

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,600
If a realtor were to say: "why are we
talking about the children in cages ?"

45
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,720
"The kitchen has marble countertops",
the only acceptable response

46
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,080
would be: "because they're
children and they're in cages."

47
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,080
Someone needs to let them out,
you fucking monster.

48
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,200
Let's talk about something that
is not the Trump administration.

49
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,840
Let's talk about Norway,
you know, one of these.

50
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,040
Norway is actually home to over
100  7-Eleven locations,

51
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,480
and this chain got itself into trouble
over an ad aimed at foreign tourists.

52
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,040
This ad is real
and there is a twist in the middle.

53
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,680
Norway

54
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,880
The land of the fjords

55
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,560
The midnight sun

56
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,760
And Chlamydia

57
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,080
Norway has one of the highest
rates of chlamydia in Europe

58
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,600
Visiting from abroad ?
Protect yourself against the locals !

59
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,600
Get your condoms
at 7-Eleven !

60
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,440
Holy shit ! Okay, 7-Eleven,

61
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,240
you can't just call Norway
the "Land of Chlamydia".

62
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,360
That's opening yourself up
to a class action lawsuit

63
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,480
from Las Vegas, Tampa
and the wave pool at every water park.

64
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,480
It wasn't just video ads. 7-Eleven
put posters in train stations

65
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,040
and I'm in a position to say:
that is the second-most shameless

66
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,320
signage-based chlamydia publicity
stunt I've ever seen.

67
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,640
The Norwegians who saw those
posters were understandably confused.

68
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,000
What ? I'm speechless.

69
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,760
Not a very good ad for Norway.

70
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,840
It's unfortunate we have
this kind of thing for a tourist.

71
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,000
Is this the reason
people come to Norway ?

72
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,440
Sleeping around... Isn't it places
like Thailand you go to for that ?

73
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,240
That is a pretty lazy
stereotype of Thailand.

74
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,120
Which is not to say that there are
not sexual aspects of Thai culture.

75
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,240
Did you know that Thai Iced Tea
is just regular iced tea

76
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,920
with four fluid ounces
of jizz poured into it ?

77
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,840
I don't know if it's always true,
but it is always true when I make it.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,920
That is refreshingly viscous.

79
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,480
Norway does have one of the highest
reported chlamydia rates in Europe.

80
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,920
7-Eleven's are not the most explicit
ads promoting sexual health.

81
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,280
The Norwegian Directorate of Health
produced these posters that translate

82
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,760
to "use a condom on your dick"
and "use a condom in your pussy".

83
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,800
Which is bold, but also makes it sound
like Norwegians "had" condoms,

84
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,680
but were just using them wrong,

85
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,240
for keeping their jelly beans fresh
and water-proofing their dogs' paws.

86
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:03,320
My favorite STD themed Norwegian ad
campaign came from RFSU,

87
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,520
which promoted safe sex
in the greatest possible way.

88
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,160
Okay,
I only have favorite parts of that.

89
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,480
First, obviously: the screaming.
Why does he need to do that ?

90
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,480
Those people have been shot by
a giant, sneaky penis,

91
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,520
haven't they been
through enough ?

92
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,160
Second: that tagline translates to
"penis can surprise you",

93
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,560
which sounds like how an old
Russian hits on you at an airport bar.

94
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,280
"I may not be much to look at,
but penis can surprise you."

95
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,840
I like that when the penis
is about to ejaculate,

96
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,640
it bends in half
so the shaft forms a right angle.

97
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,480
If your penis can do that,
please send video proof

98
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,160
to Sessions-dot-Jefferson
at u-s-d-o-jdot-gov.

99
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,200
All joking aside here,
let's be serious for a minute !

100
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,240
Practicing safe sex
is extremely important.

101
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,760
It's ridiculous that condom usage
is still not universal.

102
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,080
You're putting yourself and
your future partners at risk,

103
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,480
not just for chlamydia, but also
for HIV and even cancer...

104
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,520
Fuck you !
You sneaky penis ! And now this.

105
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,160
Local news
is concerned about teens.

106
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,880
It is a teen trend doctors fear
may be headed to Kansas City.

107
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,800
The teens chugging hand
sanitizer to get drunk.

108
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,440
Here's a new trend among teens.
Putting lip balm on your eyelids.

109
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,960
Teens, drinking bleach
to pass a drug test.

110
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,120
- Kids are snorting Smarties.
- Smoking Smarties.

111
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,000
- It's called "i-dosing".
- Fence plowing.

112
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,120
- The overnight challenge.
- The hot coil challenge.

113
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,720
First time
you're hearing about boozy bears.

114
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,520
Eating cotton balls to lose weight.

115
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,920
Teenagers snorting condoms.

116
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,160
Two years ago we were talking
about a different condom challenge,

117
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,800
where people fill a condom with water
then someone drop it on their head.

118
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,360
Some kids are so desperate they're
doing their own dangerous dental work.

119
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,520
Moving on. For our main story
tonight, let's talk about Mexico.

120
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,840
Number 7 on the list of things
Trump is most frightened of,

121
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,320
ahead of Muslims and behind
the concept of self-reflection.

122
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,040
Mexico is a nation of 123 million,

123
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,840
give or take a few American spring
break douchebags like these two:

124
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,760
Cancun is the hands down best place
you can come for spring break,

125
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,800
especially being a college kid.

126
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,080
Getting tipsy and then drunk
and then yayo on top of everything.

127
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,240
If you get tired here
Cancun is the best for that, so.

128
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,800
Cool.

129
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,000
My favorite part of that clip
is that, in the corner,

130
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,000
it promotes something
called "Brain Surgery Live".

131
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,480
I hope is just a brain surgeon
lobotomizing these two bros.

132
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,760
Mexico isn't just a tourist destination,
we share a 1 900-mile border

133
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,720
and they're our third
largest trading partner.

134
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,640
Something massive
is about to take place there.

135
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,080
It's going to be the biggest
election in Mexican history,

136
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,080
with positions up for grabs
from Mexico City Mayor,

137
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,960
to Congressional seats,
to the top job itself.

138
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,360
Next Sunday will see the biggest
election in Mexico's history.

139
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,840
Which doesn't mean much
to most Americans.

140
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,440
It's like saying "the biggest
mattress sale in Dutch history"

141
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,480
or "the biggest mouse penis
in Portuguese history."

142
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,880
Their mouse is sort of hung, how does
this affect me in any way ?

143
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,640
They could replace their president,
their entire Congress

144
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,320
and state
and local governments.

145
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,600
Many believe a major shift
may be about to take place there,

146
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,520
Mexicans are sick
and tired of the status quo.

147
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,960
Their current president's approval
rating sunk as low as 12 percent.

148
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,240
It's become common for people
to shout a phrase at him:

149
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,920
All I want to say to Pena Nieto is that
he go and fuck his bitch mother !

150
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,880
Enrique Pena Nieto,
go fuck your bitch mother !

151
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,040
Fuck your mother, Pena Nieto !

152
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,200
Pena Nieto,
fuck your mother !

153
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,840
Fuck your bitch mother !

154
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,560
Fuck your mother, Enrique Pena !
Fuck your mother !

155
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,280
"Go fuck your mother" is something
people only shout when they are angry.

156
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,520
Nobody shouts it cause they think you
and your mother have great chemistry.

157
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,240
That's never happened.
So tonight, let's look

158
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,640
at why people are so angry at Mexico's
current president Enrique Pena Nieto

159
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,120
and who they are considering
to replace him.

160
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,640
Most Americans
don't know much about him.

161
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,840
For instance:
that's not Pena Nieto.

162
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,400
That's what came up when we typed
"Mexican man" into a stock image site.

163
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,320
As long as he's here, let's give
this guy a spin: look at him go !

164
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,880
The man is leaving it
all on the field !

165
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,400
Just so you know:
this is the real Pena Nieto.

166
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,080
He is also so handsome he
resembles a stock photo model.

167
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,520
He was swept into office in 2012,
on a wave of hype,

168
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,120
he made the cover of "Time"
with the headline "Saving Mexico",

169
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,040
and U.S. coverage
of his election was breathless.

170
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:42,200
The 45-year-old former governor is
married to a Mexican soap opera star.

171
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,680
Wherever they went
they drew huge crowds,

172
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,400
especially women, who despite
the fact Pena Nieto was married,

173
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,200
couldn't get enough of him,
calling him bombón,

174
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,280
which means
sweet thing or hottie.

175
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,600
He admitted cheating twice
on his first wife and bearing

176
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,080
two children out of wedlock
before she died of epilepsy,

177
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,560
but didn't seem
to faze the adoring crowd.

178
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,360
Yeah !
All of that is true !

179
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,960
That would be unforgivable,
if he wasn't so violently attractive.

180
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,800
How are you gonna stay mad at that ?
He is visually fucktacular.

181
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,360
Pena Nieto's election
was dramatic.

182
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,760
His party, the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI,

183
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,160
had enjoyed a 71-year-long era
of one-party rule in Mexico,

184
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,760
which ended in 2000.

185
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,760
So real multi-party democracy
is very much a new thing there.

186
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,600
For many, the hope was that Nieto
would clean up the party's image,

187
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,480
and restore it to glory,
but that did not happen.

188
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,720
He was implicated
in a number of serious scandals,

189
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,880
not only did corruption
not improve,

190
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,800
it hit such a fever pitch that
visitors to Mexico City could do this.

191
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,480
This is the Corruptour,
a 90-minute bus ride

192
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,960
to the seem-ier side of Mexican
business and politics.

193
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,640
On its itinerary:
ten city landmarks

194
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,000
where public money has allegedly
been diverted for private gain.

195
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,640
There were bus tours of Mexico's
most appalling landmarks.

196
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,480
I hope that that tour includes

197
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,800
Guillermo del Toro's two Oscars
for "The Shape of Water".

198
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,560
I was rooting for
the fish-man to die.

199
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,840
The fish-man was gross
and I didn't enjoy watching him fuck

200
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,120
and anyone who did
is weird and wrong.

201
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,880
The scale of government corruption
in Mexico is hard to comprehend.

202
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,320
Many politicians have close ties
to cartels and gangs.

203
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,360
14 current or former governors
are under investigation for corruption,

204
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,200
some of them for colluding
with organized crime.

205
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,480
Like Javier Duarte,
governor of Veracruz.

206
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,840
On his watch,
the state was bankrupted,

207
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,280
with three billion dollars
missing from official coffers.

208
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,200
He's been charged with racketeering
and using illegally obtained funds.

209
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,720
While he denies those charges,
he fled the country in a helicopter,

210
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,920
only to be tracked down
and arrested.

211
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,400
What is that smile ?

212
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,840
That is not the face a grown man
makes after being arrested.

213
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,040
That is the face a nine year old makes
after urinating in a public pool.

214
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,640
This pervasive corruption
contributes to a sense of impunity

215
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,520
and diminished faith
in cops or courts.

216
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,760
Violence has spiked in Mexico,
with the country on track

217
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,480
for 32 000 murders this year,
twice as many as in 2014.

218
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,480
Only 2 percent of crimes
in Mexico get solved.

219
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,280
Which may explain
why these two "yayo" fiends

220
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,280
didn't seem to put much effort
into their disguises.

221
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,880
For many, the incident that
encapsulates all of this frustration,

222
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,960
government corruption, violence
and a serious lack of accountability,

223
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,880
is what happened
on Pena Nieto's watch in 2014.

224
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,280
43 students disappeared
September 26th

225
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,640
after boarding a bus
to the town of Iguala

226
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,760
to raise money
for an upcoming trip.

227
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,160
The mayor there feared the students
would disrupt an event for his wife

228
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,760
and had police stop them.

229
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,800
The officers opened fire
and turned the students over

230
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,040
to a drug gang, which killed them
and burned their bodies.

231
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,920
It was horrific and incredibly,
it got worse than that,

232
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,600
there is evidence the federal police
and military were involved

233
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,720
in the disappearances
but the government did not pursue it.

234
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,880
And when you hear all of that,
you can sort of understand

235
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,400
why so many people want to tell
Pena Nieto: "chinga tu madre".

236
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,040
He is not running for re-election,
Mexico's presidents are limited.

237
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,920
Who are his potential replacements ?
There is José Antonio Meade,

238
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,920
also from the PRI but he has no chance,
so we're not gonna talk about him.

239
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,480
Jaime Rodríguez, an independent and
state governor known as "El Bronco".

240
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,160
He also has no chance. But we are
very much going to talk about him,

241
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,280
because he is a human
wrecking ball.

242
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,360
Watch his idea for stopping
government corruption.

243
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,960
We need to cut off the hand of anyone
who steals in the public service.

244
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,360
You're not speaking literally,
are you ?

245
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,640
- Yes.
- Cut off their hand literally ?

246
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,600
- Literally.
- Explain to me.

247
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,120
Anyone who steals
must have his hand cut off.

248
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,320
A bill must be presented so that
the Congress approve it.

249
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,320
Cut off the hand of the criminals ?

250
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,760
You're gonna propose this
in the Congress ?

251
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,440
That moderator gave him
five separate chances to say

252
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,480
that he wasn't being serious
and he just Bronco'd his way through.

253
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,960
Chopping off somebody's hand is
drastic for political corruption.

254
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,440
Although a perfect way to eliminate
contestants from my new reality show:

255
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,680
"America's Next Top
Sock Puppeteer."

256
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,840
I'm sorry,
flopsy bunny didn't wow us.

257
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,040
Anthony, please, place your hand
on the chopping block.

258
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,120
That is not
El Bronco's boldest position.

259
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,320
'Cause he also has a firm and
unwavering hatred of Santa Claus.

260
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,040
I don't believe in Santa Claus.
Do you believe in Santa Claus ?

261
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,040
How many believe in Santa Claus ?

262
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,680
Look, just three.
Santa Claus is bad.

263
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,800
It's true, "El Bronco" hates Santa.
If you think we are cherrypicking

264
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,640
just one example of virulent
anti-Santa-ism, think again.

265
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,480
When did you tell your kids
there was no Santa Claus ?

266
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,600
Every day.

267
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:25,760
He tells his children every day
that Santa is not real. That is harsh.

268
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,720
That is so harsh.

269
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,200
Hold on. Who's that ?

270
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,320
Hello, boys and girls !
It's me, Santa ! Sorry to interrupt.

271
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,920
Santa ! I can't believe you're here !
This is fantastic !

272
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yes. I just wanted to tell Mexican
presidential candidate "El Bronco"

273
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,840
that I do exist !

274
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,040
I bring magic to children
all over the world !

275
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,520
So that "El Bronco"
is on my naughty list !

276
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,640
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I must get back to the North Pole !

277
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,040
Santa, I've always wondered,

278
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,000
what do you do up there all year,
when you're not delivering presents ?

279
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,840
I masturbate, dear boy !
I masturbate all day and night !

280
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,440
I masturbate and masturbate until
my sack full of presents is empty,

281
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,280
if you catch my meaning !

282
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,120
Why would you say that, Santa ?

283
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,040
Every day is Christmas for Santa
when he masturbates !

284
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,880
I even do it sometimes when
I'm flying on my big red sleigh !

285
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,800
I try not to get any on the reindeer,
but even Santa's not perfect !

286
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,000
This is different than what I thought
meeting you would be like, Santa !

287
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,080
Yeah, I get that a lot.
I'm not sure why !

288
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,720
I mean look at me,
I'm very weird !

289
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,680
I love to stroke it
till it looks like a candy cane !

290
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,680
Please leave ! Please leave, Santa !
Please leave !

291
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Just leave Santa, leave !

292
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,360
Never meet your heroes, ever.

293
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,360
The point is, "El Bronco" is not going
to be the next Mexican President.

294
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,720
The candidate polling second,
is Ricardo Anaya,

295
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
a 39-year old
center-right wonk.

296
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,280
He is known for delivering 20-minute
policy presentations

297
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,480
that are even more explainer-y
than the ones on this show.

298
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,520
The yellow line shows the behavior
of manufacturing employment

299
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,240
in the United States.

300
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:43,800
As you can clearly see, it remains
steady, despite NAFTA.

301
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,000
Right. I mean yeah,
on one hand, that was boring.

302
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,640
We now know what it would look
like if Pitbull went to grad school.

303
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,400
This guy is a bit of a nerd. Although
he does desperately try to be cool,

304
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,160
'cause he plays a bunch
of musical instruments.

305
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,280
He plays guitar, he plays ukulele,
he plays keyboard,

306
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,080
and the coolest instrument
of all: the recorder.

307
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,680
That is simply pathetic.
And it is not just me saying that,

308
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,360
in Mexico, that clip has unleashed
a "tsunami of memes",

309
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,040
including videos where people
swap in different songs,

310
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,720
like this version
of Britney Spears' "Toxic".

311
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,560
Muy bien, Mexico.

312
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,640
Anaya did try and toughen his
image up during the campaign.

313
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,480
He struggled to stick the landing,
like when he released this video.

314
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,160
What are you doing ?

315
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,120
'Cause hitting that speed bag
is genuinely impressive,

316
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,160
but you then ruined it with
that weird smile at the end.

317
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,000
It's like someone pulling the
cloth from underneath a table setting

318
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,840
and then pissing their pants.

319
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,400
You were so close,
you fucking ruined it though !

320
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,560
But the man widely expected
to win this election

321
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,600
is Andrés Manuel López Obrador,
a populist who goes by "AMLO".

322
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,880
He served as Mayor of Mexico City,
building a reputation

323
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,440
as a man of the people, commuting
to work in a Nissan Sentra,

324
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,160
the vehicle rated "meh"
by J.D. Power and Associates.

325
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,880
This is AMLO's third time
running for president,

326
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,760
he lost in 2006 and 2012,
not taking that first loss well.

327
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,280
Not only did
he refuse to accept the results,

328
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,320
he held a gigantic alternative
inauguration ceremony in Mexico City

329
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,880
in which he was sworn
in with a fake sash

330
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,240
and declared himself
the legitimate President of Mexico.

331
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,840
His supporters occupied the city's
central square for months.

332
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,080
When Al Gore lost the 2000 Election,
he didn't hold a fake inauguration,

333
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,200
he just told us we were all gonna
die and it was our fault.

334
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,640
It was just called
basic good sportsmanship.

335
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,680
AMLO's campaign has caught fire
this time around,

336
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,080
because he has tapped
into populist anger.

337
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,280
He's promised to help the poor
and eradicate corruption

338
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,600
and he often rails against
the elites and the mafia in power.

339
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,720
Don't think we're the same
as those corrupt politicians.

340
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:38,000
I've been fighting for the poor
for over 40 years and until I die,

341
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:43,520
I will keep fighting
for those in need.

342
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,720
That sounds great ! And you can
kind of see the appeal there.

343
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,120
AMLO is kind of like Bernie Sanders,
but with a better haircut

344
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
and significantly better Spanish.

345
00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:00,360
Washington...  a Goldman Sachs
y a Wall Street...

346
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,840
He could've carried 100 percent
of the Hispanic vote if his slogan

347
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,240
had been: "vote for me and
I will never speak Spanish again."

348
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,080
AMLO's goals may be clear,

349
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,800
but the details of how he plans
to achieve them can be sketchy.

350
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,880
His opponents attacked him
as a "dangerous leftist",

351
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,520
but journalists who've covered him
say it's hard to judge things

352
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,200
based on his policy platforms,
because they are prone to change,

353
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
and that he often
makes big promises

354
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,080
while keeping his own advisers
guessing as to what he means.

355
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,560
In that way, he's more reminiscent
of a Mexican Donald Trump,

356
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:41,400
which is a weird image to conjure up,
like Orthodox Hitler or jacked Gandhi.

357
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,240
The two concepts
don't fit well together.

358
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,320
But the lack of concrete policy

359
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,960
hasn't dampened
the excitement around AMLO,

360
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,400
whose supporters
have made striking ads.

361
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,240
I am here to remind the corrupt
politicians that have ruled our country

362
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,600
that you have turned Mexico
into a poverty factory.

363
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,800
You have killed our children.

364
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,680
The tiger is not afraid, gentlemen,
and we have woken up.

365
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,880
Holy shit ! That is the most
terrifying tiger I've seen

366
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,520
since the episode of "Winnie the Pooh"
where Tigger ate Eeyore.

367
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:22,640
They're wild, Christopher Robin !
It was bound to happen.

368
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,360
Not a tragedy,
that was inevitable.

369
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,480
That ad becomes less fun
when you learn that it was made

370
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,040
by the Social Encounter Party,
an evangelical Christian party

371
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,080
that opposes same-sex marriage,
homosexuality and abortion.

372
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,320
That party is in AMLO's coalition.
Which kind of speaks to the fact

373
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,400
that by being so vague, he can let
people see what they want to see.

374
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,120
A Christian conservative party
can think that he's on their side.

375
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,000
As can the much more
liberal people behind this ad,

376
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,240
which pitches AMLO
as an aphrodisiac.

377
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,360
Wait !

378
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,840
Everything OK ?

379
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,800
It's just that...
I'm going to vote for Andrés Manuel.

380
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,840
Me too.

381
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,560
- Seriously ?
- Yes.

382
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,640
That is the most sexually
explicit campaign ad

383
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,360
since Roosevelt's famous slogan
of "Teddy will make you cum".

384
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,160
While the hope in AMLO is real,
the content is a question mark.

385
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,680
It says something about how
entrenched problems in Mexico are

386
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,200
and the level
of people's dissatisfaction,

387
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,000
that they seem so willing
to take a gamble on him.

388
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,840
We've talked about the problems
in Mexico, of which there are many.

389
00:25:54,920 --> 00:26:00,200
But people are putting
their lives on the line to solve them.

390
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,840
Journalists tackling corruption,
despite the fact that Mexico

391
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,800
is the third deadliest country
in the world, after Iraq and Syria.

392
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,080
And there are honest politicians
running for office,

393
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,840
even though 120 politicians,
including 44 candidates,

394
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,160
have been killed
during this campaign.

395
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,400
In the town of Piedras Negras,
an anti-cartel Congressional candidate

396
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,640
was murdered
just earlier this month.

397
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,960
But the mayor there
is refusing to hide.

398
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,360
We reached the current Mayor
of Piedras Negras, Sonia Villarreal,

399
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,120
who says her life was threatened
just yesterday.

400
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,520
- You're not fearing them ?
- No.

401
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,720
You won't stop.
Even if it means risking your life.

402
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,560
Doesn't matter.

403
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:55,320
That is just amazing.
For the record:

404
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,960
I am not that brave at all.

405
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,720
I'll shit-talk the drug cartels
from the safety of New York.

406
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,240
This is the actual head
of the Sinaloa cartel

407
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,400
and I'll say that he looks like
Andy García won a pizza-eating contest,

408
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,400
'cause fuck that guy,
I'm not scared of him.

409
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,440
I wouldn't have
the courage to say that in Mexico.

410
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,160
I wouldn't even have
the courage to say it here,

411
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,600
that's not the head
of the Sinaloa cartel.

412
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,040
That's another stock photo.
Do you think I'm fucking crazy ?

413
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,960
Do you think I'm insane ?
I'm a coward.

414
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:36,240
Mexico is on the verge of the biggest
election in their history,

415
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,120
with a chance to combat corruption
that betrayed its people for too long.

416
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,800
I hope the candidates they choose,

417
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,120
are worthy of the trust
that's about to be placed in them.

418
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,520
It's gonna take brave, bold work to
give that country the change it needs.

419
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,400
Santa Claus is not coming
to save Mexico.

420
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,440
As we learned tonight,
that man is very busy.

421
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,960
No, please, not again.

422
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,240
No, Santa don't do this Santa,
please.

423
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,520
Don't do what ?

424
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,240
Vividly describe how I bring myself
to climax 364 days out of the year ?

425
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:17,320
I tinker in my toy shop, John !
I fill my stocking !

426
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,640
I polish the North Pole !

427
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,720
The elves taught me yoga
and now I can blow myself !

428
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,760
No, Santa, no !

429
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,840
And now this.

430
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,520
Kathie Lee and Hoda
are slowly becoming one.

431
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,360
- Timing...
- Is everything !

432
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,840
By the way it's...
National Cookie Day.

433
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:45,520
Tyra Banks. Tyler Posey.
Rachel Fong. Simon Biles.

434
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:52,000
Simon Pegg. Gal Gadot. Geno Vento.
Jusando. Joe Manganiello.

435
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,080
Ginger Ed Man.
Jordan and Kyle take the aisle.

436
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,480
Isn't that awesome ?

437
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,160
Barnes & Noble. "Ready Player One".
"Blockers !" "Get Out !"

438
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,680
Guys tell all.
"Girl, Wash Your Face." Her face.

439
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,160
Thong !
Other one on the other hand !

440
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,560
And it fits ! Miracle.
Eighty pounds.

441
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,960
Chillin with my snowmies. One pot
pork with pickled peppers.

442
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:21,360
Barbra: The Music, The Mem'ries,
The Magic. Hungry. Hangry.

443
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,000
How do we do it day after day ?

444
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,400
That's our show !
See you next week. Good night !

445
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,040
LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER
